## Key Features Analysis

The muscle tank market is diverse, with each garment offering a unique combination of features. Understanding these specifications can significantly impact your choice,ensuring you select a tank that aligns with your activity level and preferred style.**Fabric composition:** The ideal muscle tank should feature a breathable, moisture-wicking fabric.

Many top-rated tanks utilize a blend of polyester and spandex, typically in an 88%/12% ratio. This combination provides excellent stretch and recovery, ensuring the tank moves with you during workouts. Some brands also incorporate natural fibers like bamboo or organic cotton for added softness and breathability, though these may not wick away moisture as effectively as synthetic blends. The weight of the fabric, measured in grams per square meter (GSM), also impacts the tank's feel; lighter GSMs offer better breathability, while heavier GSMs provide more coverage and durability.

**Cut and Design:** The cut of the muscle tank significantly influences its style and functionality.

A classic muscle tank features wide armholes for maximum range of motion and a relaxed fit through the body. Variations include cropped styles, racerback designs, and tanks with built-in bras. The length of the tank should also be considered; longer tanks provide more coverage, while shorter tanks are often preferred for high-waisted leggings or a more modern look. Seam placement is crucial for comfort; flatlock seams minimize chafing during intense workouts.

**Moisture-Wicking Technology:** Effective moisture management is essential for staying cozy during exercise.

High-quality muscle tanks incorporate moisture-wicking technology that draws sweat away from the skin and allows it to evaporate quickly. This helps regulate body temperature and prevent that uncomfortable, clingy feeling. Some brands use proprietary technologies,such as Dri-FIT (Nike) or HeatGear (Under Armour),which are engineered to enhance moisture-wicking performance. Look for tanks that explicitly state their moisture-wicking capabilities in their product descriptions.

**Durability and Construction:** A well-constructed muscle tank should withstand repeated washing and wear.

Reinforced seams and durable fabrics are key indicators of a long-lasting garment. Double-needle stitching along the hems and armholes enhances durability, preventing fraying and tearing. The quality of the fabric itself is also crucial; look for tanks made from high-quality materials that resist pilling and fading. Reading customer reviews can provide valuable insights into the tank's durability over time.

**Color and Style Options:** Aesthetics play a crucial role in choosing a muscle tank.

While functionality is paramount, most women also desire tanks that are stylish and flattering. The best brands offer a wide range of colors, patterns, and designs to suit different preferences. Solid colors are versatile and easy to pair with other workout gear, while bolder patterns can add a pop of personality. Consider the neckline and overall silhouette to find a tank that complements your body type and personal style.

*   High-quality moisture-wicking fabrics

Drinking caffeine started off good, was feeling great but now im feeling the anxiety creeping back in a depressed mood, and tension headaches. 

So its just not worth it for me and I’ll try to go no caffeinated drinks again from tomorrow. Its a slippery slope and I’m not one that can moderate caffeine well. I need it daily once i start and then the negatives quickly take over. I know not everyone has these issues but for me it messes with me, unfortunately.

She was in the hospital but was doing better and had been moved out of icu. The last visit on Thursday, I had brought my daughters(10&12) with me to spend time with their “Nani”. She was a little tired and groggy but overall was doing so much better from days before where she almost died in the icu. We gave her hugs and as I closed the sliding door to her room I gave her a big smile and a wave goodbye. She was weak but did her best to give me a wave and a tired smile back. That was the last time I saw her awake/conscious. While the nurses were adjusting her in the middle of the night she got sick and was so weak it went straight into her lungs. I have horrible visions of how scared she must have been. How much pain was she in? Did she know this was it? They kept her alive long enough for my brother and I to get there and we had to let them know when we were ready to let go. I’m so sad. I miss her so much. I’m mad. I’m 43 and while I’m not that young I didn’t think she’d be gone already, at 72. My dad killed himself when I was 11 so this is it. No more parents. I feel so bad for my mom. She just wanted to be loved and was alone for so many years. She wanted to get a puppy but knew it would be challenging with her declining mobility. She wanted to go on a cruise. Shoot we couldn’t even go to the town carnival because she was under the weather so much this summer. I know her health issues in many ways were her own doing but she was still a good person, a good mom and a good grandma. My head is spinning with setting up cremation, her finances, her home, obituary, celebration of life, ugh it’s a lot! When all I want to do is keep the shades closed a few more days and just cry in bed. But I have 2 young daughters that need me to pick myself up and keep moving. They understand though, we are all grieving, on 3 different rollercoaster and while the days are tough, they are productive. Productive in feeling the feels, crying it out, hugging and reminiscing on the kitchen floor, I’ve got amazing kids. My mom was so proud of me being a good mom and how amazing my girls are. I miss her so much. No more long texts from her, coffee while the girls are at school, doing her hair and makeup…it hurts a lot.

## Key Features Analysis

The characteristics that define a quality skull cup extend beyond mere aesthetics. Material, craftsmanship, and functionality play crucial roles in determining its overall value and appeal.

**Material Composition:**

The material used significantly impacts the cup's durability, aesthetics, and drinking experience. Options range from high-quality stainless steel, known for its robustness and ease of cleaning, to more fragile but visually striking ceramics and glass. Polyresin is also a common material, allowing for intricate detailing but generally being less durable than metal or ceramics. The choice of material hinges on balancing desired aesthetics with practical considerations like maintenance and longevity. Higher-end skull cups may even incorporate precious metals or gemstones for added luxury.

**Design and Detailing:**

intricate designs and realistic detailing are hallmarks of many skull cups. Some feature anatomically accurate skull representations, complete with textured surfaces and subtle variations in bone structure. Others opt for more stylized or abstract interpretations, incorporating decorative elements like engravings, paintwork, or sculpted adornments. The level of detail and artistry directly influences the cup's visual impact and perceived value.Some manufacturers employ 3D printing techniques to achieve remarkable accuracy and complexity in their designs.

**Size and Capacity:**

Skull cups come in a variety of sizes, ranging from small shot glasses to larger mugs and goblets. The capacity of the cup influences its intended use.Smaller cups are ideal for serving spirits or espresso, while larger mugs are better suited for coffee, tea, or even decorative purposes. Consider the volume of liquid you typically consume when choosing a skull cup. A common size for a drinking mug is between 12-16 ounces, whereas decorative storage containers may boast much larger sizes.

**Durability and Stability:**

A well-made skull cup should be durable enough to withstand regular use and handling. Look for cups made from sturdy materials with reinforced construction.

I'm coming in a few weeks to visit your beautiful country.  I'm now starting to make reservations for meals.

I heard that ""The Church"", ""The Boxty House"", and ""Hawksmoor"" are all great in Dublin.  I definitely plan on The Boxty House and The Church, but I noticed that Hawksmoor only gets 3.8 stars on Trip Advisor.  I've seen a lot of positive comments in other subreddits.

  
Any thoughts on Hawksmoor?  I'm going there for lunch.  If you have a different recommendation for a similar type of food, I'm open to hearing it.

  
Also, I'm looking for a good place to grab a small breakfast and coffee in the morning.  I'm staying at O'Donoghue's on Merrion Row.  

  
I look forward to all suggestions.  This group has been very helpful in my planning.

  
Thank you!

I am absolutely clueless on candles but wish to buy a nice one for my SO.

She is not the kind to dare treating herself and I decided that she should, for her birthday, get a candle that actually throws.

I tend to not smell her candles or very little and she thinks it’s normal the smell is not very noticeable. 

I thought if getting a sample of three petites but I feel it won’t be enough for our space.

Any size suggestions for a living room with a high ceiling (18 feet high in the living room) with open plan with the kitchen, dining room and stair case. 

Probably about 400 feet squared just the living room?

Any advice is welcome :) I have to buy blind as we live in the middle of nowhere but I know she likes spices (vanilla, cinnamon, tobacco, coffee etc.) and woodsy. I thought Cire or Bayonne but I honestly have no clue. Her current ones are cinnamon/orange, fir, and cocoa/vanilla.

I love this roaster, maybe because of our water at home that's why the beans that i order are always amazing. So when i saw this curry bean, i got really curious. im not expecting for it to be amazing, again, im just curious so i ordered a sample bag which is 100g.

details of the brew are posted as a photo. 

use 3 pour
20% bloom for 45sec
upto 50%
then used melo drip upto 100%

my big question: 

the processing is washed. So do you mean that there exist beans that have these characteristics? or there was some sort of processing involved? (the roaster is lying)

1mtbzkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1mtbzkw/is_the_timemore_sculptor_064s_an_endgame_grinder/,Is the Timemore Sculptor 064s an Endgame Grinder Platform? [1000$],"Hey everyone,

**What I want:**  
I’m ready to make a serious upgrade to my espresso setup. My main goal is to finally learn how to dial in coffee properly—this has been the hardest part with my current grinder. I want a grinder that makes dialing in precise and predictable, while also letting me explore coffee at its best. I’m particularly drawn to flat burrs, since people often describe them as producing more clarity in the cup, which sounds exactly like what I’m looking for.

**My background and current gear:**  
When I first started, I bought capable but not top-tier equipment, since I wasn’t sure how far I’d take the hobby. Now espresso has become my favorite hobby, and I’m ready to invest more seriously. My machine is a Profitec Go, which seems more than good enough—upgrading it wouldn’t add much in terms of pure espresso performance. My grinder is a Fellow Opus, which I bought mainly for pour over but with the option to try espresso. It’s been limiting: the adjustment steps are too large, retention makes it hard to know when changes have taken effect, and switching between espresso and pour over means dealing with retained grounds and extra cleaning. Do higher-end flat burr grinders also have this problem when switching brew methods?

**Why I’m considering the Sculptor 064s:**  
From what I’ve learned, burrs—not the grinder body—are what shape taste the most, and most innovation today seems to be in burr design. That makes me think the smart approach is to choose a grinder that serves as a platform for burr upgrades. The Timemore Sculptor 064s appeals to me because it supports 64mm burrs, which are widely available and well supported by aftermarket upgrades. More expensive grinders seem to emphasize workflow and UX, but taste is my top priority. Bigger burr grinders exist, but they often use non-standard burr sizes, which limits flexibility. What’s your experience with aftermarket 64mm burrs—should I stick with stock or go straight for SSP? I’ll also be traveling to Korea soon, so I wonder if it’s worth buying SSP burrs there since local prices might be better.

**My questions:**

1. Is my reasoning sound, or am I overlooking something important?
2. Is the Timemore Sculptor 064s really the best choice for my goals?

Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences!",1,1755490405.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

[OOC: This is a part two to this post for more context: https://www.reddit.com/r/Earth25/s/PuDQT4G8Qo ]

[OOC: TW: Suicidal Ideation] 

IC:

Hey guys. I am the guy who’s family has been circulating the news lately. To be honest my life hasn’t been going well. To sum it up, My great grandpa was responsible for Germany’s various attempts at artificially creating metahumans. He fled to America in the late 40’s to escape Justice. He started a family in Gateway City which he had been using to test various theories as to how to activate or cause meta genes in people. It’s why he paid out of his own pocket to building housing for the greater extended family on the large acres of land he owns outside the city limits. What we thought was kindness was him using us as lab rats.

About a couple weeks ago the DEO came knocking on our door. Now he is at the Hague and I get to ogled at like some freak because I am a metahuman. As far as I am aware my abilities are a hyper strong immune system and the ability to rapidly heal when I get hurt. 

I hoped the news would bring me and my family some sympathy. Our lives were a lie. We thought we were all a big happy family. That maybe we would if nothing else get some pity. But, no. The worst kind of people want me to validate their politics as some kind of avatar. I am not a bad person. I am not hateful. I have friends of all walks of life. I am not some warrior. I am just a guy who worked a boring office job and likes painting. But they just won’t leave me alone. I ~~know~~ think they are following me. I moved out of the property and into the city to ~~escape~~ avoid them. But I feel constantly watched. I lost my job because my coworkers “don’t feel comfortable around me” anymore. I can’t find work. My savings can only take me so far. 

I can’t keep going anymore. I have no idea how am going to get through this. ~~I am not sure if I should check myself into Arkham or see how far my powers can go. I am unwell. I feel watched even when I am alone. I know the man reading the newspaper is spying in me. He kept looking at me at the coffee shop. I want to scream at him so bad. I can’t prove he is. But I keep seeing him everywhere.~~

~~I’ll need to delete the bad stuff before I post this on r/metahuman. I just need to lie down when I finish posting this. I can’t let them think I am a danger to anyone. I can’t. Fuck. Why is it so hard to focus. What happened to you? What is wrong with you?~~

If any of you guys have any ideas that would be much appreciated. I just have no clue what to do anymore. Any advice would be appreciated.

Finding Grace’ A latino story, that finds Jenna Ortega’ Finding herself, While Finding Grace’ while on Angels Ravine 

Not really remembering anything from before, Before, a dark raven haired Latina, brown eyed girl named Jenna Ortega’ had awakened into a world in which she would now find herself. Living in a world now where she see meets people that have since passed. But from within her new world that she now lives in, along with the people that she meets along the way. While riding her bike discovering new trails that would show her a life that was once hers. 

From waking up to looking out her window setting there looking out into a world that was still very much new to her, thinking to herself as she sat there. Looking as the sun’s light glimmered onto the street in front of as people was coming and going. People that was still very new to her. In a world that was still very much new to her. People that she was soon about to meet as the sun’s light glimmered into her room from her window while still giving her the feeling of that she has always been here. 

For when you wake up in another life being someone else, not knowing anyone around you. But at the same time having the feeling that you have always been lived here being the person that you are. The person that upon looking into a mirror, looking at a young girl with anticipation of what was about to be, 

For Jenna’ a very outgoing dark haired girl, That very much knew how to handle things that would come her way. Knowing that everyday brought something new to her, giving her the feeling of a a new path to discover in her life with new adventure’s. Taking her to different places in and around the area, finding new biking paths that showed her different areas not only on the path. 

But a new path showing her a life that was once hers, a life that she now had no memory of after waking up to being the girl that she was now. A young Latino girl, who very much knew the path that she wanted to take. But finding which path that would take her to that place would be a challenge altogether. A challenge that she was ready to take, but for Jenna’ herself and her bike was all that she needed. While meeting new and different people along the way. 

But while at the same time, meeting new people while finding herself coming closer to in her life. But as Jenna’ would quickly get dressed, anticipating what the day may bring her. Wearing a black tee and a pair of cut at the knees jeans! Not forgetting about her shoes that just fit her personality that she was to everyone around her. 

Running out the door grabbing her bike in her way with high anticipation what the day may bring her, anticipation of new path in her life. Ready to see the path that lyes ahead of her, jumping on her bike just as her neighbor Lou Diamond Phillips’ shouted out to Jenna’ saying to her

“Hey Jenna’ don’t let those boys show you up today” 

And with a wave to Lou from Jenna’ just before Jenna’ set off riding her bike into the day, with Lou Diamond Phillips a 63 year old dark haired Latino, was one of first people that Jenna’ had met. With Lou’ being a street smart Latino himself, often found himself teaching Jenna’ all about life and growing up in her new found life. Teaching her all about the streets, and riding, for Lou’ himself also knew a few things about riding a bike himself. 

A girl that wasn’t afraid to express herself, while at the same time excepting a challenge, From anyone that wanted to race her. With her showing them what was! While at the same time! Finding herself coming closer to others, Knowing that the world around her was changing every day seeing and meeting new people along the way. While at the same time! Finding out that some people around her had many stories of their own to share. Finding herself coming close to some. Whether it was as a friend! or like family to her. 

But as Jenna’ quickly got dressed! Grabbing her bike and on her way she went! Not looking back! But only ahead! Ahead to what was to be! As she was now finding herself. Looking out onto a bustling street in front of her, Jenna’ was going to let nothing stand in her way! From doing this run! A run that she had a done dozens of times before. For just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new to Jenna’

In a way that was just unexplainable to her! For it felt like she had always been here, lived here! And was born here. But unknowingly to her at the moment, the days ahead would show her different paths. Paths that would take her to slowly finding out who she was. For as sat there on her bike, looking down a street just in front of her was that long all downhill from there. But the need to race! The need for speed was there! And she here now and ready for her run.

With her not always having the feeling of really not knowing on how or why she was here. But in a way she felt that she had always been here, but with her having that feeling in her that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, but she only knew where she was at the moment! only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! Feeling the wind push up against her! Speeding in and around cars along the way!

With the feeling of something just being different about still residing within her, more so than usually toady. With the feeling that all of this still felt very new to her, its surroundings, The people, Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here. That she had always been here.

Jenna’ was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 23rd birthday. Growing up in a small town that had a big city feel to it to her. But to Jenna’ it was her home, but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that one day she would riding her bike through the downtown streets. 

Weaving in and around cars passing by them as the wind blew through her long Raven hair! feeling free from the world around her. Racing was her excitement, and it showed, along with her smile saying it all. Making her way through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed them by.

With Jenna’ having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Jenna’! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just him watching out for her, for her own safety.  But Jenna’ also had someone else watching out for her! A young latino! Named Hector’ With his dark hair brown eyes, And a smile For Jenna’ But Jenna’ was just your typical young brown eyed girl! Who liked her shredded jeans and tee shirt and hoodie living her life! Her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Jenna’ being the girl that she was never backing down from a challenge. Finding herself racing through the towns streets, finding herself racing along with one or two others.

Not to say that one of them didn’t catch her eye, But! From time to time, Hector’ very much would catch her eye, for he was the kinda guy that could charm on a dime. A Latino, Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match! Especially on a bike. Often calling out to Jenna’ saying to her.

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Jenna’ Whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them. Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it. Knowing that Jenna’ was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Jenna’ leaving him with a glance and a smile! as Jenna’ left him looking. And saying to himself “Dam! That’s my girl!”

Just way the way he liked it, always looking and watching out for her. While Jenna’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different. 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. Finding new trails along the way but with each new trail she would ride. It was like it was showing something to her! As if it was trying to tell her something.

But with each new day bringing something new to her, a new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself very well on a bike, Jenna’ would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city. Telling Jrnna’ about his own street races, with Jenna’ always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Jenna’ needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go on forever, Dodging in and out of traffic. But always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Jenna’ was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life for her. More than often finding herself thinking about her life! For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life! It felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail, a trail Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts. Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts, that was as if they belonged to someone else. It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. A Coffee Shop, That was owned by Hector’s father.

Also named Hector’ She would also find herself taking with him not only about bikes! But also about different things in general. With one! Being of his son Hector’ for Jenna” very much had a crush on him. Often finding herself dreaming of not only Hector’ but a life being on her own! Making her own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular would walk in as he often would, setting down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. A regular, who was named Voodoo’ Lawrence Fishburne,or at least his friends would call him that. But Lawrence Fishburne a 64 year old former bike rider himself. Often found himself talking to Jenna Ortega’ telling Jenna’ about his own little bike rides. When he was a bike rider from the city. A regular that Jenna’ came know from their talks at the coffee shop. But not only would he talk to her about bike riding, but he would often talk to Jenna’ about life in general. By helping her to find and make her own path in life. 

For Voodoo’ would often tell Jenna’ about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for the many great nights he had here in the mountains when he was younger. Jenna’ always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Voodoo’ would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where he wanted to be buried. That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen, and that in the end that this was his home. That this was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Jenna’ would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Jenna’ would find herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she had grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you were an Angel, looking out from Heaven itself. For it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often just settling there looking down onto the town. It was a small town but it was her home, it was where she would come to know. With everyone helping Jenna in their own way to find her path in life. A path that would eventually lead to her right path in life. 

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Jenna’ for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget. Finding herself there on many occasions just to relax, to think about her life! Thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. Or on one of the many trails that was on the outskirts of town, Jenna’ found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Jenna’ setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below her Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Jenna’ loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself. 

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. Occasionally as Jenna’ sat there she would often think about Hector’ thinking about the many trips that they had made up to Angels ravine

As they sat there looking out over into the town that was just ahead of them. They would often set there talking to each other as Hector would often put his arm around Jenna’ as Jenna’ would often find herself leaning up against Hector’ as he would tell her all about his own little adventures in life. 

But as Jenna’ sat there thinking back on her and Hector’ setting There listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Jenna’ was, Never in the same town that she had grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go with her waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in. Often finding herself looking out of the window into the suns morning light. Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by. Some she knew, while others being new to the area. With Jenna standing there thinking about all of people and who could they be? who could they be? Someone else from somewhere else?

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Jenna’ rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Jenna’ that was her Life being on her bike loosing herself in the world around her. Racing as the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Jenna’ herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Jenna’ would refer to it by. 

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Jenna’ enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Jenna’ had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Jenna’ and Hector to a race, but not just any race but a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Jenna’ and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times that they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Jenna’ then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Jenna’ are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Jenna’s All I know is how I feel about the Jenna’ that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Jenna’ then giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Jenna’ before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you either! laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Jenna’ that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead. But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Jenna’ and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Jenna’ trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Jenna’ then stopping to check on him as Hector’ then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Jenna! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Jenna’ had caught up to them, for Jenna’ knew the trails like no other. With Jenna now Racing hard and faster like she had ever raced before to the finish. Racing side by side with the outsider Just as Jenna’ then gave him a look and smile to him as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail leaving him setting there as Jenna’ had won the race. Later that evening Jenna’ and Hector’ would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Jenna’ just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector’ then saying goodbye to Jenna’ as he then headed back to town leaving Jenna’ there for the night. As Jenna found herself that night looking up into a starlit sky thinking back on her life. Thinking back on everyone that she had come to know wondering where her next path would take her in her life. Thinking about Hector on where the path would take them or if the path would lead them on their own separate paths. Thinking back on the talks that she had with Lawrence Fishburne also known as Voodoo, and the talks that she and Lou diamond Phillips had had. Simply known as Lou to her. With each of them helping her find and make her own path in life. 

As she came to the ravine Jenna’ then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Jenna’ had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Jenna’ began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Jenna’’ could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Jenna’ would set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Jenna’ lay there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. lying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Jenna’ had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Jenna’ would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she had lived before! Before the town that she lived in now. But this time something happened that had never happened before. But a name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone then called her Jenna’

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light as it glimmered in and around all the trees sound her. putting her hands up to her head Jenna’ just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this other Jenna’ And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Jenna’ just sat there looking around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Jenna’ began to scream! As a calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man began to speak saying

 “Hello Jenna’ it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Jenna’ as Jenna’ then replied saying to the him

“Then why are you standing there looking at me? And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Jenna’ I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Jenna’ then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Jenna’ your dreams.” 

As Jenna’ just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Jenna’ just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Jenna’ and it is not you”

More confused then ever Jenna’ just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Jenna’ standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is not! and you are not. For her Life is her Life! For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Jenna’ then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Jenna’ And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Jenna’

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now! But look for what is to come!  for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Jenna’ for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Jenna’ was now standing there looking out over Angels Ravine, Jenna’ couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then dreams of the girl was now slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Jenna’

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now for it was her town her home. Her Life! With Jenna’ now leaving Angels Ravine, making her way back home, but as usual finding herself racing to beat her own best time.

Jenna’ was now making her way back into in Life, along with Hector by her side, riding through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. For she was now riding into Life! into her 

Life, Living a Life of what she made it. For that day! Jenna Ortega’ had found Grace

| (21M) recently moved to Delhi after joining a company (around June this year). Since I wasn't a campus hire, I joined my team a bit later and most of my colleagues already have their friend circles (since they all of them are much older than me like 26-30). They're nice to me, but they usually hang out in their own groups, and I end up just going back to my flat after work.

I've always been a pretty social person, but for the past few months it's been quite lonely man, no one to explore Delhi with, grab food, or just chill on weekends. It honestly feels sad seeing others have fun experiences while I'm stuck figuring out shit on my own.
I'd really love to make some genuine, platonic friends here people to talk to, hang out with after work, or explore the city together. Doesn't have to be anything fancy, coffee, food walks, weekend outings, whatever works man.......

If you're also in Delhi and looking for a good friend, pleaseeeee feel free to DM me (//V//) and lemme know your experience in the comments as well.",1,1755490271.0,TwentiesIndia,3,1.0,False

Finding Grace’ A latino story, that finds Jenna Ortega’ Finding herself, While Finding Grace’ while on Angels Ravine 

Not really remembering anything from before, Before, a dark raven haired Latina, brown eyed girl named Jenna Ortega’ had awakened into a world in which she would now find herself. Living in a world now where she see meets people that have since passed. But from within her new world that she now lives in, along with the people that she meets along the way. While riding her bike discovering new trails that would show her a life that was once hers. 

From waking up to looking out her window setting there looking out into a world that was still very much new to her, thinking to herself as she sat there. Looking as the sun’s light glimmered onto the street in front of as people was coming and going. People that was still very new to her. In a world that was still very much new to her. People that she was soon about to meet as the sun’s light glimmered into her room from her window while still giving her the feeling of that she has always been here. 

For when you wake up in another life being someone else, not knowing anyone around you. But at the same time having the feeling that you have always been lived here being the person that you are. The person that upon looking into a mirror, looking at a young girl with anticipation of what was about to be, 

For Jenna’ a very outgoing dark haired girl, That very much knew how to handle things that would come her way. Knowing that everyday brought something new to her, giving her the feeling of a a new path to discover in her life with new adventure’s. Taking her to different places in and around the area, finding new biking paths that showed her different areas not only on the path. 

But a new path showing her a life that was once hers, a life that she now had no memory of after waking up to being the girl that she was now. A young Latino girl, who very much knew the path that she wanted to take. But finding which path that would take her to that place would be a challenge altogether. A challenge that she was ready to take, but for Jenna’ herself and her bike was all that she needed. While meeting new and different people along the way. 

But while at the same time, meeting new people while finding herself coming closer to in her life. But as Jenna’ would quickly get dressed, anticipating what the day may bring her. Wearing a black tee and a pair of cut at the knees jeans! Not forgetting about her shoes that just fit her personality that she was to everyone around her. 

Running out the door grabbing her bike in her way with high anticipation what the day may bring her, anticipation of new path in her life. Ready to see the path that lyes ahead of her, jumping on her bike just as her neighbor Lou Diamond Phillips’ shouted out to Jenna’ saying to her

“Hey Jenna’ don’t let those boys show you up today” 

And with a wave to Lou from Jenna’ just before Jenna’ set off riding her bike into the day, with Lou Diamond Phillips a 63 year old dark haired Latino, was one of first people that Jenna’ had met. With Lou’ being a street smart Latino himself, often found himself teaching Jenna’ all about life and growing up in her new found life. Teaching her all about the streets, and riding, for Lou’ himself also knew a few things about riding a bike himself. 

A girl that wasn’t afraid to express herself, while at the same time excepting a challenge, From anyone that wanted to race her. With her showing them what was! While at the same time! Finding herself coming closer to others, Knowing that the world around her was changing every day seeing and meeting new people along the way. While at the same time! Finding out that some people around her had many stories of their own to share. Finding herself coming close to some. Whether it was as a friend! or like family to her. 

But as Jenna’ quickly got dressed! Grabbing her bike and on her way she went! Not looking back! But only ahead! Ahead to what was to be! As she was now finding herself. Looking out onto a bustling street in front of her, Jenna’ was going to let nothing stand in her way! From doing this run! A run that she had a done dozens of times before. For just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new to Jenna’

In a way that was just unexplainable to her! For it felt like she had always been here, lived here! And was born here. But unknowingly to her at the moment, the days ahead would show her different paths. Paths that would take her to slowly finding out who she was. For as sat there on her bike, looking down a street just in front of her was that long all downhill from there. But the need to race! The need for speed was there! And she here now and ready for her run.

With her not always having the feeling of really not knowing on how or why she was here. But in a way she felt that she had always been here, but with her having that feeling in her that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, but she only knew where she was at the moment! only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! Feeling the wind push up against her! Speeding in and around cars along the way!

With the feeling of something just being different about still residing within her, more so than usually toady. With the feeling that all of this still felt very new to her, its surroundings, The people, Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here. That she had always been here.

Jenna’ was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 23rd birthday. Growing up in a small town that had a big city feel to it to her. But to Jenna’ it was her home, but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that one day she would riding her bike through the downtown streets. 

Weaving in and around cars passing by them as the wind blew through her long Raven hair! feeling free from the world around her. Racing was her excitement, and it showed, along with her smile saying it all. Making her way through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed them by.

With Jenna’ having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Jenna’! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just him watching out for her, for her own safety.  But Jenna’ also had someone else watching out for her! A young latino! Named Hector’ With his dark hair brown eyes, And a smile For Jenna’ But Jenna’ was just your typical young brown eyed girl! Who liked her shredded jeans and tee shirt and hoodie living her life! Her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Jenna’ being the girl that she was never backing down from a challenge. Finding herself racing through the towns streets, finding herself racing along with one or two others.

Not to say that one of them didn’t catch her eye, But! From time to time, Hector’ very much would catch her eye, for he was the kinda guy that could charm on a dime. A Latino, Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match! Especially on a bike. Often calling out to Jenna’ saying to her.

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Jenna’ Whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them. Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it. Knowing that Jenna’ was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Jenna’ leaving him with a glance and a smile! as Jenna’ left him looking. And saying to himself “Dam! That’s my girl!”

Just way the way he liked it, always looking and watching out for her. While Jenna’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different. 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. Finding new trails along the way but with each new trail she would ride. It was like it was showing something to her! As if it was trying to tell her something.

But with each new day bringing something new to her, a new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself very well on a bike, Jenna’ would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city. Telling Jrnna’ about his own street races, with Jenna’ always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Jenna’ needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go on forever, Dodging in and out of traffic. But always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Jenna’ was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life for her. More than often finding herself thinking about her life! For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life! It felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail, a trail Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts. Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts, that was as if they belonged to someone else. It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. A Coffee Shop, That was owned by Hector’s father.

Also named Hector’ She would also find herself taking with him not only about bikes! But also about different things in general. With one! Being of his son Hector’ for Jenna” very much had a crush on him. Often finding herself dreaming of not only Hector’ but a life being on her own! Making her own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular would walk in as he often would, setting down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. A regular, who was named Voodoo’ Lawrence Fishburne,or at least his friends would call him that. But Lawrence Fishburne a 64 year old former bike rider himself. Often found himself talking to Jenna Ortega’ telling Jenna’ about his own little bike rides. When he was a bike rider from the city. A regular that Jenna’ came know from their talks at the coffee shop. But not only would he talk to her about bike riding, but he would often talk to Jenna’ about life in general. By helping her to find and make her own path in life. 

For Voodoo’ would often tell Jenna’ about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for the many great nights he had here in the mountains when he was younger. Jenna’ always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Voodoo’ would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where he wanted to be buried. That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen, and that in the end that this was his home. That this was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Jenna’ would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Jenna’ would find herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she had grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you were an Angel, looking out from Heaven itself. For it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often just settling there looking down onto the town. It was a small town but it was her home, it was where she would come to know. With everyone helping Jenna in their own way to find her path in life. A path that would eventually lead to her right path in life. 

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Jenna’ for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget. Finding herself there on many occasions just to relax, to think about her life! Thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. Or on one of the many trails that was on the outskirts of town, Jenna’ found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Jenna’ setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below her Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Jenna’ loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself. 

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. Occasionally as Jenna’ sat there she would often think about Hector’ thinking about the many trips that they had made up to Angels ravine

As they sat there looking out over into the town that was just ahead of them. They would often set there talking to each other as Hector would often put his arm around Jenna’ as Jenna’ would often find herself leaning up against Hector’ as he would tell her all about his own little adventures in life. 

But as Jenna’ sat there thinking back on her and Hector’ setting There listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Jenna’ was, Never in the same town that she had grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go with her waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in. Often finding herself looking out of the window into the suns morning light. Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by. Some she knew, while others being new to the area. With Jenna standing there thinking about all of people and who could they be? who could they be? Someone else from somewhere else?

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Jenna’ rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Jenna’ that was her Life being on her bike loosing herself in the world around her. Racing as the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Jenna’ herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Jenna’ would refer to it by. 

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Jenna’ enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Jenna’ had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Jenna’ and Hector to a race, but not just any race but a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Jenna’ and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times that they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Jenna’ then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Jenna’ are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Jenna’s All I know is how I feel about the Jenna’ that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Jenna’ then giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Jenna’ before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you either! laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Jenna’ that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead. But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Jenna’ and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Jenna’ trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Jenna’ then stopping to check on him as Hector’ then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Jenna! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Jenna’ had caught up to them, for Jenna’ knew the trails like no other. With Jenna now Racing hard and faster like she had ever raced before to the finish. Racing side by side with the outsider Just as Jenna’ then gave him a look and smile to him as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail leaving him setting there as Jenna’ had won the race. Later that evening Jenna’ and Hector’ would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Jenna’ just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector’ then saying goodbye to Jenna’ as he then headed back to town leaving Jenna’ there for the night. As Jenna found herself that night looking up into a starlit sky thinking back on her life. Thinking back on everyone that she had come to know wondering where her next path would take her in her life. Thinking about Hector on where the path would take them or if the path would lead them on their own separate paths. Thinking back on the talks that she had with Lawrence Fishburne also known as Voodoo, and the talks that she and Lou diamond Phillips had had. Simply known as Lou to her. With each of them helping her find and make her own path in life. 

As she came to the ravine Jenna’ then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Jenna’ had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Jenna’ began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Jenna’’ could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Jenna’ would set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Jenna’ lay there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. lying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Jenna’ had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Jenna’ would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she had lived before! Before the town that she lived in now. But this time something happened that had never happened before. But a name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone then called her Jenna’

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light as it glimmered in and around all the trees sound her. putting her hands up to her head Jenna’ just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this other Jenna’ And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Jenna’ just sat there looking around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Jenna’ began to scream! As a calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man began to speak saying

 “Hello Jenna’ it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Jenna’ as Jenna’ then replied saying to the him

“Then why are you standing there looking at me? And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Jenna’ I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Jenna’ then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Jenna’ your dreams.” 

As Jenna’ just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Jenna’ just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Jenna’ and it is not you”

More confused then ever Jenna’ just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Jenna’ standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is not! and you are not. For her Life is her Life! For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Jenna’ then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Jenna’ And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Jenna’

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now! But look for what is to come!  for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Jenna’ for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Jenna’ was now standing there looking out over Angels Ravine, Jenna’ couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then dreams of the girl was now slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Jenna’

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now for it was her town her home. Her Life! With Jenna’ now leaving Angels Ravine, making her way back home, but as usual finding herself racing to beat her own best time.

Jenna’ was now making her way back into in Life, along with Hector by her side, riding through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. For she was now riding into Life! into her 

Life, Living a Life of what she made it. For that day! Jenna Ortega’ had found Grace

We had a lab together so after the first day of class we got assigned into different groups but out of class we only talked once or twice so we were more like acquaintances. But during class, sometimes I’d catch her looking over at me a lot to see what I was doing or sometimes if the prof made a joke she’d look at me and laugh or try and see my reaction even though we were pretty far apart and in different groups. So I was like maybe she wanted to be friends. 

After the quarter ended, I DM’d her on Instagram asking if she wanted to get coffee or boba sometime over the summer since we’re both from the same city. She responded super enthusiastically and said “I WOULD LOVE TO!!” and thanked me for asking, but said she was busy until July. I replied that I’d be free after July because I had summer quarter until then and she left that on delivered cause I think she has her read receipts off so I just left it alone after that.

Then in August, I posted a video of me singing a cover (I hadn’t posted in like 6 months), and she replied to my story out of nowhere saying “U ATE SO HARD” and “BRO UR SO GOOD AT SINGING.” I just said “aww thanks girl ur so sweet” and didn’t think too much of it.

A week later, I decided to follow up and ask if she was still free and wanted to hang out before summer ended but the next morning she deactivated her account for a few hours, then reactivated it and removed her profile pic and all her story highlights. Now her profile looks completely blank, but she’s still following me and I still follow her and I can see she’s still active and liking other people’s posts and things like that.

I checked that she didn’t block me or restrict me or unfollow me or anything like that and I saw on LinkedIn that she started an internship recently, so maybe that’s part of it… but the timing is so specific that it kind of feels like I made her uncomfortable.

I just don’t know what to make of this like is this her way of saying she’s not interested? Should I just leave her alone completely and act like nothing happened if I see her in person again or should I just ignore her in person and pretend like she’s a stranger?",2,1755490104.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

- 


I’ve often thought of that year as a waiting period, a complete freeze. My world put on hold. I had been torn away from everything that mattered, any remaining tendrils of connection ruthlessly snipped. I felt altered; so many things I had hung my personhood on were no longer accessible to me. I was wiped clean. I felt my heart straining towards home, a relentless directed pressure, like something in my chest was thrashing against my ribs, caged. I believed nothing of significance could happen until my life was returned to me. I pictured the long-awaited reunion: me, stepping off the airplane, the amalgamation of everything that made me a person waiting on the ground. Our recoupling would return me to existence. 


In the midst of this separation, I forgot that there is no nothingness. There is no removal without replacement. I would not live in a vacuum. The people that had been taken from me would be replaced by strangers. There was a house in California that was no longer mine, but a house in Utah had a bed with my name on it. I was to be transplanted. My roots, freshly ripped from home soil, shivered and recoiled as they met air. Once sunken in new dirt, what could they do but burrow, searching, reaching, doing only what they know how to do? 


Quickly, I found that I could not avoid attaching myself to the things I came in contact with. I put my pictures on the wall. I chose a seat at the table. I tried to grow a tomato seed in a cup on the windowsill and cried when it never came up. I could not stop myself from inhabiting this place. Even as I focused my conscious energy on resistance, I couldn’t avoid curling up and settling in. 


Julie used to bring me lemon drops. She showed me the back of her car once, popped the trunk and dazzled me with a sea of citrus yellow. She bought them in bulk and filled her pockets before her shift each morning. Late at night, I remember turning one around inside my mouth, trying not to let it click against my teeth. I pressed my tongue against that vibrant secret, feeling as though it must be glowing inside my skull, emanating from my eye sockets and loosening my fingernails. If I did not contain it, I felt that it could surely blow me apart. 


We used to sit out on the front porch together, watching reflections move in the puddles after it rained. I don’t know how she found all that time to spend alone with me. She was usually the only shift lead on staff, and responsible for the entire house’s operations, but I remember countless afternoons spent sitting there with her. Sometimes she pulled me from class to help her prepare lunch for everyone. We made sandwiches, me giddy with exhilaration and her nervous about being caught. I ran to the bathroom when we heard a noise at the door, braced myself against the wall in the shower with my hand over my mouth. I knew without her telling me that I would take the blame if I was seen. On the porch, the wind changed the puddles. She told me about her fiance, about her pet turtle, her old job at Provo Canyon. She’d already been working in facilities for a decade. Once a kid had tried to kill her. 


I had never met anyone like her before. She didn’t like music. I couldn’t wrap my head around that. I risked punishment every night as I hid under the covers with the mp3 player I had smuggled in my bra. In the darkness I would creep from my bed and open the blinds to watch the snow fall in the yard, letting the music envelop me. We all craved music, begged staff to break the rules and let us use the radio in the car. It was another thing I didn’t know I’d miss until it was removed from me. In the real world, there is music everywhere. In the car, in a coffee shop, at the grocery store, from the man with a violin on the street, and in your earbuds whenever you want it. It was a debasing thing to beg for, but it felt vital. I could not believe there could be a person who did not need it. 


She didn’t like people either, but she liked me. It wasn’t a secret; I was treated differently. I knew what I could get away with. I had to behave around the others, but when we were alone, I could talk back to her without punishment. I could lay my head on her lap. She wouldn’t touch me, but she wouldn’t make me move. If I cried, I could sometimes wring a hug from her. Touch was another luxury. She would empty her pockets of lemon drops if I asked; sometimes she’d even open the car for me if I wanted more. It felt like something very close to kindness. The other kids didn’t like her, but I knew that was because she saved her soft side for me. 


There was a cupboard in the garage where the cleaning supplies were kept, secured with a padlock that needed a four-digit code. I would ask for a dishwasher pod and watch over the staff’s shoulder, standing a few feet back as the rows of bottles and boxes opened into my view. Each time, my gaze felt pulled towards the basket of disposable razors. I knew how to take one, wrap the head in toilet paper, snap it over the edge of the counter and let some of my blood out. It had been six months and I needed it. The staff always cupped the padlock in their palm, eyeing me as they spun the right numbers to convince it to release. Sometimes I would slip away to the garage and stare at it in the dim light, holding it in my hand, feeling the cold metal. I tried different numbers, spinning them at random and tugging hard, but it wouldn’t listen to me. 


Julie trusted me. We were friends. She was telling me a story about her fiance, about the miniature pool they bought for her turtle. He drove an hour to get it for her and they had set it up over the weekend. As she talked, one hand illustrated her words, gesturing by her face as the other operated the padlock. I laughed as she spoke. The numbers smiled up at me. 


I held them in my mind for hours, salivating. The knowledge made my heart beat harder and my stomach twist. My body felt overfull, kinetic energy upsetting its equilibrium. Everything that had been shoved down my throat was rotting and expanding within me, needing out. It would be like slicing through a bulging net of fish, silver spilling out in torrents, the relief of release. I couldn’t think about anything else.


I ferried my secret upstairs, concealing it in cupped hands until I opened my journal and let it run onto the page. As I sat there with guilt dripping off my fingers, my conscience crept back in. Could I do this to her? Would she feel responsible? I thought of the look on my mother’s face when I had come to her bleeding for the third time, the way she looked split open and so young. On the way to the hospital, she told me I wouldn’t be coming home anymore. Nothing I could have said would have softened her; what I had done was irreversible. I felt frozen in shame. I needed to unburden myself, to extinguish this knowledge before it could fester inside of me. 


Again I went to Julie, seeking absolution. My confession was clumsy and urgent. I hoped only that she would prune this desire out of me, lift the sin from my heart and make me light again. I know now that I should have lied, should have told her I saw the code by accident. Instead I was earnest; I spilled myself over the table like a pocket turned inside out, crumbs and coins skittering onto the floor. Julie shook her head at me, collected the whole mess in her arms and dumped it on the desk of her supervisor. 


The program’s highest-level staff were not responsible for our daily supervision. We knew them only as the disembodied voices floating down from the floor above as we did our schoolwork, the invisible hands that rifled through our things when we left the house, and the texts that appeared on the shift phone, instructing the daily staff in their handling of us. Julie reported my infraction, and a message lit the phone’s screen in response. Yes, I was to be punished. I spelled out my crime on my point card, and Julie sealed it with her signature. 


That night, I slept on a cot in the hall, within arm’s reach of a stranger who sat beside me as the night wore on. I watched him cross and uncross his legs. His movements seemed to occur in a continuous loop: legs crossed, heavy sigh, check the time, switch flashlight from one hand to the other, legs uncrossed. Every fifteen minutes he would go and step into the bedrooms where the others slept, sweeping the beam across their faces to make sure they hadn’t disappeared. Blocks of light and shadow layered over the carpet. I couldn’t fall asleep.  I rolled onto my stomach, tucking the blanket around myself and lying on top of my own arms like the weight would contain me, keep me pinned down. I felt something pressing against my chest, hard and insistent like it was struggling to break through my skin and enter my body. I reached into my bra and pulled out a lemon drop. The next time the guard stood, I unwrapped the candy and stuffed the wrapper into my pillowcase. I held that little bit of yellow between my teeth and let the sweetness bleed across my tongue and slide down my throat. It warmed me from the inside out. 


I did not blame Julie for my punishment, blamed only the powers above her that dictated her decisions. To me, she was something separate. She was the hand that fed me. The punishing hand was not hers, it came from somewhere else. She was the wire mother, the surrogate warmth that I clung to in the absence of something more real. I could not reconcile her apparent kindness with the position that she held. I watched her treat my friends with needless cruelty and chose to look the other way. She gave me something that I felt I could not be without. 


We kept in touch when I left. We each created secret email addresses during my last week, using references to our conversations together in place of our names. I thought it was a joke, that she would not risk breaking the program’s rules. 


I flew home and tried to adjust to the ice-cold shock of reentry into the world. In many ways, my homecoming was exactly as I imagined it. My family held up a sign as I debarked the plane. I found that my friends had saved my spot in their lives; slipping back into those relationships was easier than I would have ever expected. The dogs remembered me. Days spun by and I tried to be good. 


Her first message said only, “hi.” I didn’t answer right away. I had stepped back into my old body, becoming the version of myself that was free. My skin fit differently than it did before. Something had changed; the memory of being caged was written into the shape of me. I still felt tethered to that other soil. I thought of her smile and tasted citrus. I messaged her back. Later, she would tell me tidbits about her life and ask me about school. We messaged occasionally for years afterward. She sent me pictures of her wedding. I told her that I missed her, and I did. I didn’t need her anymore, but I was loyal. When I joined a lawsuit against the program, I said nothing about her. 


If I look up the program’s website now, I can see her smile in black and white. Her headshot stares back at me. She’s been promoted. Four years after I left, she is the one sending the texts. I picture her determining punishments while sitting at the kitchen counter next to her husband, turtle splashing in his pool outside. I wonder if she is kind.

1mtbrt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GalaxiGazer/comments/1mtbrt4/the_right_connection_cannot_and_will_not_work/,The right connection *cannot* and *will not* work with the wrong guy,"For the purpose of this post, the wrong man is a collective of the men who either had eyes on pursuing someone else and/or recognized that I was not the right woman for him. 

The right connection cannot and will not work with the wrong guy. 

Speaking to my past, I accept that: 

* This man could have and might have been a great partner for me. If he was right for me, we would be together. Because he ended up with someone else, I can peacefully conclude that he was wrong for me
* My attempts at seduction, manipulation, plotting, scheming, and devising ways to interrupt his attention so he could focus on me instead worked its magic in the present but ultimately failed in the end
* I could not succeed in winning the interest and desire from a man who was interested in someone else
* I robbed him of his agency by trying to sway his decision to (want to want to) want me
* I subjected myself to undue stress and anxiety because I wondered in the back of my mind if he was thinking of someone else and why he wasn't thinking of me
* I was too self-involved to understand that the way he treated me (i.e., as a friend, a funny guy at work, a pleasant patron waiting in line for coffee, etc.) will be different than the way he treated the woman he desired to pursue

In the present, I've decided to abandon my past behaviors: 

* Throwing myself at a man, believing that his polite rejection, whether once or on repeat, was just a matter of coaxing him into wanting me
* Knowinginly come in between him and someone else if I can pick up and read the room that he has eyes on her and she welcomes his pursuit
* Holding it against the other woman for being treated differently and better by him, even when he shows me respect, kindness, and ensures our interactions are strictly platonic
* Expecting an available and interested man to ""wait"" for me and to make himself exclusive to me when I'm not available to be with him, followed by holding it against him if/when he decides to pursue someone who is (more) readily available to him
* Believing that his attention on me and taking notice of my behavior to mean that he's interested in me and that he wants me
* Wanting to use external validation (i.e., those who observe me around this guy, google searches, etc.) to prove that my chasing him down and having his attention means that the relationship is right
* Acting out, starting drama, and playing a damsel in distress to get him to pay attention to me and focus on me instead of her
* Crafting myself to be his perfect match and present a false front of compatibility to keep him from being interested in someone else
* Believing that his rejections are simply opportunities to prove myself to him so I can eventually convince him to change his mind

That's what I look like when I try to force the right connection with the wrong man. 

Over the course of time, as my healing journey continues, I'll be expounding on this. But this is where I will leave it. 

That is all.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beziehungen/s/74xBQsTVJ9): **August 10, 2025**

I (f25) have been with my boyfriend (m26) for about two years. We're currently separated, but we're already thinking about moving in together.

I found out today that my boyfriend has a list on his phone with all his expenses and gifts, along with their prices. 

He made a joke out of the blue and said that he spent exactly €26 on me on Valentine's Day. It irritated me a bit, and I didn't think anything of it, but unfortunately, he then said that if we broke up, I would owe him exactly €280. I was shocked by what he said and that he meant it. He admitted that he wrote down every expense he made for me, saying he only did it because his ex-girlfriend had taken advantage of him. 

It's not like I'm taking advantage of him in any way, quite the opposite. I work at a hospital and earn a very good salary, I mostly cover our dates, etc., and that's not a problem for me. What is a problem for me, though, is that it seems like he sees things like gifts or snacks he gave me as something he can simply demand back. That honestly hurt me a lot.

Has anyone had similar experiences and can give me advice on how to react?

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Does he seriously think you'd have to pay him back for gifts if you broke up? Wasn't that a joke? 

> **OOP:** Unfortunately, he was serious about it; he wants the money he spent on gifts and other things back. If I were to act exactly the same way, I would already be dealing with him in a four-digit amount.

**Commenter 2:** Question: Did he only note down how much he spent on larger occasions, or did he also note down snacks, the occasional coffee, etc.?

If the former: I don't find it alarming. I know many family members who generally note such expenses, for example, how much they received as a gift from person XYZ for their milestone birthday, and then they can give back a corresponding amount on similar occasions. I do that sometimes, too, and note it as an expense in my budget for the respective month.

If the second option is yours, I find it extremely strange and worrying. I would definitely follow up and, if in doubt, not accept anything as a gift until the matter is resolved. Otherwise, it's kind of like a temporary gift. If he's already planning this so that he has something concrete to use against you in the event of a breakup... then he's probably not ready to really commit to someone yet.

> **OOP:** Unfortunately, that means everything, be it a bag of gummy bears or a coffee he bought me. So far, I've never received anything larger from him; it's often been limited to a bouquet of flowers and snacks, so it shocks me a lot.

**OOP on her boyfriend's finances**

> **OOP:** He is actually totally into the financial game, I wouldn't be surprised if he soon goes totally into it and demands everything back with interest

**Commenter 3:** I would tell him very clearly that he doesn't need to give me anything anymore. Gifts should be given out of love, not as a reward, and to bring joy to others. We don't even discuss the price.

If you move in with him, he'll calculate how much electricity and water you've used, how much you eat (including weighing it), how much dish soap and toilet paper you use, fuel consumption and car wear and tear when he drives, payroll for household help when he tidied something up or cleaned something for you, and then at the end there'll be the bill when you split up, with payment terms and interest, or what? 

> **OOP:** My birthday is next week, and I've already told him I'll politely decline everything. The thing is, he suggested that because I consume more than he does, I should also pay more. I've always dismissed such comments as a bad joke, but he's serious.

**Commenter 4:** If he's actually serious about it, I'd cold-bloodedly make a list. I read that you'd already be in the four-figure range with him. Next time you're paying for your meal, just casually say, ""Okay, now you're only about €X in the red in case of a breakup.""

And I would take that as an opportunity to talk to him about this topic, because wtf? His gifts are basically bonds that you have to pay back at some point? I've never heard of that before.

Then he should just stop giving you presents and pay back the difference first—from then on, everyone pays for themselves. Everyone will only breathe the same number of breaths per day in your shared apartment, and you'll also need separate water and electricity meters. I'm truly sorry for phrasing this so sarcastically, but I find it incredibly disrespectful of your boyfriend.

I understand his motives, but gifts are f—ing optional. And you're not his ex.

I hope you can clarify this..

> **OOP:** I have dismissed his comments as bad, but now that I know that he means it seriously, I am very shocked. I also do not understand why anyone would expect anything in return for a gift.

**Has OOP given her boyfriend anything?** 

> **OOP:** I've paid for almost all of his dates so far, regularly give him attention without listing it, and when I think about the total, I'm already in the four-figure range. He's just stingy and resentful when it comes to his ex.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/beziehungen/s/0oLYq6HVYp): **August 11, 2025 (next day)**

I (f, 25) have been with my boyfriend (m, 26) for about two years. 

In my previous post, I already described the entire situation, and I have an update that probably explains the entire situation very well. I met up with my boyfriend at my house today. I brought up the topic again and asked him if I could take a look at the list. He refused several times and tried to distract me from the topic until I gave him a choice: either he shows it to me and talks openly about it, or I break up with him. After that, he did show it to me, but I wasn't allowed to touch his phone or scroll through the list myself. He secured the list with Face ID, which I obviously found odd, but I didn't think anything of it at first. 

In any case, absolutely everything was written down on the list, from a bottle of water to a bouquet of flowers. Everything he ever gave me or spent on during our entire relationship was written down there. After he closed the list and went on Instagram, however, I noticed that he had several lists on his phone. 

The different lists were named after different women. I thought about it for a moment and then confronted him and demanded that he give me his phone if he had nothing to hide from me. He then gave it to me and asked me not to be upset about what I would see there. 

What I found there were three more lists named after the names of three other women, and they also listed every expense my boyfriend had made for them. Things like shopping, underwear, and even restaurant visits were noted there. I knew immediately what was going on and told him I was breaking up with him and immediately kicked him out of my apartment. 

Apparently, he cheated on me throughout our entire relationship. He admitted that he'd been seeing another woman regularly for a year, but he said it wasn't physical, which I didn't believe.

I hope I've learned from this and will look out for these warning signs with my next partner. Thank you so much for all the advice; it really helped me a lot.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** One thing you can give your friend credit for is that he keeps track of his expenses. He probably also used r/Finances .

I can only imagine why this is being done to several women at the same time by looking at the cost/benefit analysis.

> **OOP:** I'm glad to finally know what was going on behind my back, but knowing that he spent several hundred euros on other women and made me feel as if he had the right to demand money back from me for his gifts was shocking. I was awake all night thinking about how to resolve the whole situation, and now I'm at least somewhat relieved, but also extremely sad.

**OOP responds to a downvoted commenter regarding seeing her boyfriend's lists** 

> **OOP:** I didn't write down every little detail but the whole thing wasn't resolved within 10 minutes. We discussed it for almost 2 hours, so he should show me the list and then I wanted to see the rest of the stuff. Afterwards he tried to convince me that we were just friends, which of course I didn't believe. He has been trying to contact me constantly via WhatsApp to convince me that it isn't the way I think it is and now he's actually demanding money from me.

**Commenter 2:** Has he tried to demand a refund from you now that you're broken up?

> **OOP:** Unfortunately yes

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/s/IXj2TEI1PP)  **June 21, 2025**

I (25M) was suffering from bloating and vomiting from December 2024. After 4 months of consulting 5 different physicians (including Gastro), 3 endoscopies and multiple tests, they arrived at the diagnosis of Crohn's with stricture at the junction of duodenum & jejunum. After the diagnosis, I found that I had became intolerant to rice and potatoes. My mom and grandmom understood the disease after I explained it to them, but my dad's opinion was that this was not a disease and ""It's all becoz u ate lot of lemons, 3 years ago"".  
After completing the meds and avoiding the specific trigger foods (rice, potatoes), I went into remission.

Around 2 weeks back, I had a flare-up which kept on increasing in severity everyday. Me and my mom saw my dad was adding something like powder to the milk before I drank it. There was no taste or odor change in the milk thou. We had suspicions that he was also adding something to the salt and sugar in kitchen.  
So I stayed in my Granny's place for a few days. During the stay I had no symptoms, not even pain or bloating. Meanwhile my mom threw away everything that was suspicious and bought everything new. I returned back to my home, we are being very careful in locking everything in kitchen and ensuring only we have access to them. After doing all this I feel better and we have seen my dad trying to pry open the things we locked.

There are 2 other things that bothered me during this time which may or may not be related.

1. Just 2 days before my flare-up, I informed that I got selected for Masters in Europe and my dad and elder brother hated that and were against it. When I said I will be going there, he replied ""Something unexpected may happen and your plan may fail""

2. Before this recent Flare-up, there was a incident when like this time my dad was doing something in kitchen (My dad never uses the kitchen). I took a sip of the milk later and there was a strong taste of rust. So I threw it out entirely & didn't think much of it.

I asked about this issue in r/CrohnsDisease around 10 days prior & intended to publish this story here too but couldn't. Here are the events that happened after that.

1. I forgot to lock a jar of cookies inside the cabinet, ate them the next day & got sick again.

2. My mom's coffee has tasted weird multiple times and she also got sick after drinking it too.

3. My Dad broke into the locked kitchen cabinet and the refrigerator.

4. We replaced all the things there and shifted them to my granny's Home.

5. Me & my mom are travelling to my granny's home for every meal.

6. We also have suspicions that my brother knows about this and chose to ignore as he visited home and avoids eating anything at home.

We are taking careful steps to confirm these. (I don’t want to get into too much detail, but we are trying to get solid evidence before doing anything further.)  
Let me know if I’m overthinking, or what steps I should take next. I feel very unsafe and emotionally drained, but I just want to make sure I’m not losing perspective.

(Note: I originally posted this initially in r/relationship_advice, but it was removed. I'm sharing it here because I still need support, and this has been a very real and painful experience.)

[AITA for refusing to give my dad and brother updates about my Master’s?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/VsaI7L9QgA)  **June 21, 2025**

I (25M) got into this dream Masters by my own effort on April, despite my health issues. The tuition for this program is actually very minimal, which is rare for a international Masters programs. I told everyone close to me, starting with my parents, elder brother, friends, close relatives(aunt & uncle) and some professors from my bachelors. My Dad (60M) was initially open to me going there but changed his decision soon after talking to my brother. He told he likely won't be able to sponsor my masters. So I applied to a scholarship and was following up on it. I also applied for an education loan. My elder brother (30M) was totally against it saying he didn't like it and even said ""Are you going to beg in that country after doing this degree?"". My mom and relatives on her side (Granny, Aunt, Uncle) were totally overjoyed & loved that I was able to get in this masters. My professors and other professionals in my field told it was a great opportunity and that it would benefit my career. I was working through all the administrative process and stuff by myself till today. My mom and relatives provided moral support during this time period and also tried to explain to my dad and brother that this is a good opportunity for me.

Yesterday my brother showed up unannounced to our home and made my mom stay in my granny's home stating that he & my dad wanted to talk to me alone. They told me I was in the wrong to inform my close relatives about this masters and demanded me to update on the process till now. I told them everything, including the education loan & scholarship I've applied. They started nit-picking the course details trying to find any fault in the program but everything was well-detailed & had no issue. Then they told me whatever I did was useless and I did nothing in these 2 months. They told I won't be getting the scholarship or the loan realistically nor do they have any money to spare for my studies.

They made it clear that they won't help in any process further but still want updates daily and need all the email I receive related to loan/scholarship/university forwarded to both of them. They instead want me to do a masters in this state next cycle / year. They told ""Stop living in a dream"" and accused me of being selfish for not thinking of the family or anyone else.

**So AITA for not giving updates or not letting them interfere in the process after this incident?**

For context: I was lucky to have completed my bachelors with almost full scholarship with a few minor expenses covered by my dad. I had move back to my parents' place and the money I saved up after that was spent very recently on my medical expenses. I made it very clear that I wanted to do my masters in this field. The masters program I got into is not available anywhere nearby (not even nearby states).

Side note: There’s also a separate and very serious situation happening at home that made me feel unsafe. I’ve made a separate post about that, so I won’t go into it here.

[Update - My dad is adding something to my food that makes me sick and now wants me to forgive him?](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/s/1x7VJAmUNS)  **Aug 11, 2025**
  
Hi everyone — I’m sorry it took me a while to update. These are my previous posts for context [Post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/s/4k5dsMBzyY), [Post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/g6gJPzel8i). I’ve been reading and replying to some comments, but I wanted to share what’s happened since my last posts.  
  
What’s happened since:
My relatives say I should meet him to secure my inheritance (legally mine) because it could help me in the future. My brother is pestering my mom to get me to talk to him.

* My mom and I relocated without telling my dad or brother. I cut off all calls and messages from them.

* We couldn’t gather much evidence except for:

   * A white powder in our plates

   * A microphone hidden under my mom’s bedroom dresser

* On the day we moved, I drank water from our house. Two days later, I had bleeding from my nose and mouth.

* Blood tests showed that both my mom and I had elevated, almost identical levels of **Strontium** and **Vanadium**.

* Our family doctor said the bleeding wasn’t from those metals, but likely from an anti-coagulant toxin (possibly a **rat poison**).

* I moved between friends’ places to recover and took the antidote for the anti-coagulant poison.

Since I moved, my scholarship and education loan were both canceled & I’m almost certain through his influence. My mom gave me her savings, which will nearly cover my degree. My dad has been telling relatives he’s “sad” I’m not talking to him. My aunt and uncle (mom’s side, who know the truth) confronted him. He admitted the poisoning but claimed it “wasn’t meant for me.” They also asked why he wasn’t financing my master’s. He said he “felt guilty” and would fund it if I talked to him. 

My dad is calling and texting me now “I want to see you or talk finally last. Under-stand my position. if not you cannot see any more later.”

I will never forgive my dad. But the inheritance is significant and could make a huge difference in my life. I’ve spoken to lawyers and the police — my dad has ways of wriggling out of legal trouble.

Do I just talk to him, get my part of the inheritance, and then cut contact?  
Or is even that too dangerous to risk?

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**Call the university about the scholarship**

>The scholarship is not on the uni side but is by a govt-funded agency. They gave me a reason that they made a mistake and just told me ""Why don't you wait for an year and try again"". The words used by the person in-charge was definitely fishy.

🜎 *A Vignette for the Reproductive Signal Collapse Diagnostic Framework*

It is 8:52 AM.
Miss Seo enters the Central Policy Research Office for Reproductive Vitality (CPR-RV), her ID card brushing the RFID sensor with a sterile beep.
She nods to a man by the water dispenser — Mr. Han, Department of Narrative Incentivization.
He does not nod back. He is not looking.
He has been standing there for 7 minutes, reviewing a juice label.

She sits down.
The email subject lines read:

* *“Quarterly Initiative Sync: Love in the AI Age?”*
* *“Please submit models for the Fall ‘Bonding Through Convenience’ outreach push.”*
* *“Lunch Poll: Egg-Free Tamago Sandwich?”*

Miss Seo opens the predictive birth rate dashboard.
It has been red for 14 consecutive quarters.
No one mentions it.
Instead, they speak of *“encouraging microtrends”* and *“optimism-based language shifting.”*

### 🜂 **Inversion Within the Policy Shell**

The CPR-RV was founded to “restore vitality to the nation’s reproductive foundation.”
But the office is quietly, ironically, populated almost entirely by RSP-5 staff:

* Miss Seo: Unresponsive to imprint formation; exhibits procedural engagement with all tasks.
* Mr. Han: Demonstrates delayed vocal response and shellcourtship-pattern facial expressions.
* Director Kim: Former fertility outreach specialist; now reliant on AI-assisted speech summarization.
* Interns: Cycle weekly, no observable affective memory retention between sessions.

No one has children.
No one is married.
No one has attempted either in the last decade.

They generate posters with smiling cartoon babies.
They write policy about *“couple reactivation zones.”*
They do not look each other in the eyes for longer than 1.5 seconds.

When asked why the TFR remains at 0.62, the director says:

> *“It’s a complex socio-psychological landscape. We believe with proper stimulus alignment and narrative reinforcement, organic trends will correct.”*

Miss Seo nods.

She has never cried in this building.
But sometimes, when the printer stalls, she watches the light bar scan across the glass…
and she feels like something is trying to read her.

It never succeeds.

---

The cafeteria is bright, but the light feels artificial—sunlight filtered through frosted panels designed to mimic a sky no one looks at.

Miss Seo sits at the roundtable. Her lunch is untouched: a sealed bento box with colorful compartments, purchased not out of hunger but habit. Around her, the colleagues from the Bureau of Population Futures gather in loose orbit, clutching reheated coffee, clutching roles.

Dr. Lim from Economic Modeling adjusts his glasses and begins.

> “If we shift the subsidy timing to coincide with median neuroaffective cycle markers, we may trigger bonding onset more efficiently.”

No one questions what “neuroaffective cycle markers” are. They all nod.

> “Or,” offers Deputy Director Eun, “we could explore narrative recalibration. People don’t want children because they no longer *feel* part of a continuity arc. We need more mythic scaffolding.”

A murmur of agreement. Someone writes “mythic scaffolding” on a whiteboard with a thick, squeaky pen.

Miss Seo finally opens her bento and moves a piece of tamagoyaki with her chopsticks, but she doesn’t eat.

Across the table, Research Officer Park clears his throat.

> “Has anyone considered mandatory cohabitation programs with augmented emotional priming modules?”

Silence. Then a slow nod from Eun.

> “Ethically sensitive,” he says, “but not unthinkable.”

Miss Seo’s eyes flick to the wall clock. 12:37 PM. The second hand stutters slightly—just enough to notice.

The conversation continues: models, incentives, protocols, affective engineering. All abstracted from the body. No one speaks of touch. No one mentions love.

No one at the table has children.

No one at the table has a partner.

They all agree the crisis is urgent.
They all agree more research is needed.
They all agree the incentives must be stronger.
They all agree they are not the problem.

Miss Seo eats nothing.

I thought I was pretty proactive on set, making coffee for everyone and cleaning up after them every hour. 

But now that the shoot is over and we’re back in the office, I’m pretty much being ignored. I have nothing to do and no one talks to me, even after I ask them if there’s anything I can do to help.

1mtbhvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddardCritics/comments/1mtbhvy/the_upgrade_to_life_program_is_collapsing/,"The ""Upgrade to Life"" program is collapsing","I used to be a member of Niclas Gunther's ""Upgrade to Life"" manifestation program, much to my embarrassment and regret. It's total bullshit, like the pinned post describes, but unfortunately Niclas is very good at marketing himself as a level-headed expert.

Well, if there's anyone left who even cares, the program/brand/whatever is collapsing. I left recently at the community is basically dead compared to what it used to be. There used to be a lot of excitement, optimism, and genuinely interesting discussion about the nature of reality and consciousness (regardless of LOA being bs in the end). Now? Barely anyone posts or comments, and when they do, it's some Neville quote lazily thrown out or a question they've already asked 50,000 times.

I didn't feel supported, guided, or coached in any way. I watched some fucking powerpoint presentations for hours and hours listening to Niclas narrating over the top of them, did some basic homework like ""imagine climbing a ladder"" and got none of my desires in the end. Every time I asked or posted about how the core method isn't working (attainment of the wish fulfilled state), the discussion would go back to conceptual fluff. Everyone in the community keeps repeating the same teachings like they know it works from experience, while no one is actually achieving their dreams. It's literally just a never ending conceptual circle-jerk. I think I've heard Niclas explain the fundamental process of LOA about 10,000 separate times without any exaggeration, and he gives that as the answer to every question.

The group calls have also fallen off and barely happen a couple times a month now. Even when they do, there's only a tiny handful of people joining. Again, the same tired questions and topics are repeated endlessly, never getting to a point or a result. There are no big success stories, just crap like free coffees and relatives receiving good medical results (because you know, that never just happens on its own).

The membership numbers are dwindling and decreasing continuously, not just in the private community, but on YT. Niclas is losing subscribers and views are shit. He hasn't even posted in half a year. If you check comments on the latest videos, it's just people asking when he's coming back, with him not giving any concrete answer.

IMO, the manifestation fad has been losing steam for a few years ago and even Niclas sees the writing on the wall. I wouldn't be surprised if UTL is shut down without warning and he disappears off the face of the Earth, to move on to the next ""business opportunity"". The dude is the scammy entrepreneur stereotype  through and through. And there are some extremely fragile and delusional people in UTL who will not be ready for the rug pull moment.

EDIT: If anyone's wondering why I left, besides not getting results and becoming disillusioned, the final straw for me was this dude's obsession with Bentinho Massaro, who is a sociopath and scammer. I highly, HIGHLY encourage people to do their research on Ben, including the video Vice did on him a while back. The dude is a fucking creep and a Temu cult leader.

Back home, my best friend Sara (31F) and I have been inseparable for nearly a decade.

Three years ago, while visiting home over Christmas, I met Alex (30M). He was a few years younger, things escalated fast, and for about two weeks it was like a gay Hallmark movie. He even came to visit me abroad, but it crashed and burned quickly. We ended things romantically, agreed to stay “friends,” and moved on… kind of.

Whenever I went back home, I’d sometimes see Alex. I introduced him to my circle, including Sara. They clicked — same field, similar interests. I was fine with it. But Alex had a habit of drama: disappearing, reappearing, cutting contact. About a year ago, he ended things for good, saying I reminded him of our failed relationship. This time, instead of chasing, I let him go. I even blocked him everywhere — yes, including LinkedIn.

Still, I told Sara, “If you want to stay friends with him, that’s fine. Just don’t replace me with him.” I thought it was a joke.

Then came the subplot: Sara’s mom. Out of nowhere, she started calling me to complain about Alex. She thought he was a bad influence, too flamboyant, and even blamed him for Sara’s breakup with her almost-fiancé. At first, it was just venting. But this summer, the calls escalated: her mom said her husband (Sara’s dad) was furious, and even threatened to call the police on Alex if he didn’t stay away. (We live in a country where being LGBT can put you at real risk, so this was terrifying to hear.)

I didn’t want to be in the middle of this. I respect Sara’s family, but I never asked to be their messenger. If I told Sara earlier, it would’ve caused another nuclear fight with her mom (they fight all the time). If I didn’t tell her, I’d be keeping things from my best friend. Either way, I’d lose.

When the threats became real, I finally told both of them — Sara and Alex. Not because I wanted to rekindle anything with him, but because I didn’t want anyone in our community put in danger.

That night changed everything. Ever since then, Sara has been distant with me. Cold, reserved, barely talking. Meanwhile, she’s out every weekend with Alex, while I sit home like the human version of “Netflix: Are you still watching?” When I see her, it’s just quick midweek coffees or dinners — things I could do with a Tinder date or my siblings. Meanwhile, Alex is getting all the fun best-friend energy that used to be mine.

I confronted her once, and she denied it: “You’re overthinking it. I am seeing you.” But it’s not the same.

And here’s the kicker: she told me I should have said something earlier about her mom’s calls. Like this whole mess is somehow on me for keeping it to myself. I’ve tried to explain that no matter what I did, I’d have been wrong. If I told her, it would’ve fueled another mother–daughter war. If I stayed quiet, I’d eventually look like I was hiding things. I was trying to protect her, respect her family, and avoid being the “snitch” to her parents — but now it feels like she’s punishing me for it.

The last straw was this week. I asked her for coffee before I travel back. She came, but she was ice cold. Barely talking, only surface-level stuff, clearly just there out of obligation. On the way, I asked, “Since I’m leaving in a couple of days, is there anything you’d like to talk about now?” She said: “Now, no.” When I pressed, she insisted she wasn’t giving me a mood. But I’ve known this girl for 10 years. I know when she’s building walls.

So I turned the car around, drove her home, and told her: “No offense, but it doesn’t feel like you want to hang out. You’re not in the mood to be around me, so I’d rather just take you home and end this.”

Now I feel like I’m losing my best friend right in front of me. And making a new best friend at 33 isn’t something you just do overnight.",1,1755488672.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

1mtbe1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1mtbe1l/follow_up_peptide_therapy_review/,Follow up: Peptide Therapy Review,"I previously made a post about some peptide therapy that I was trying out here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1ip2bk5/healing\_with\_body\_with\_peptides/](https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1ip2bk5/healing_with_body_with_peptides/)

I thought I would try to do a little **review** of my thoughts. I will try keep it nice and succinct and digestable to read.

**Please note I have no basis to provide any medical advice and am not advocating for this treatment - so take everything with a grain of salt. I am merely trying to let people see what I've done for myself and perhaps someone might benefit.**

So, I worked with a biomed + longevity science expert **Jessica Alana** and she created me **3-month** peptide protocol (used for treating mould issues and **CIRS**) involving 6 peptides. She also provided dosages and how to add each peptide 1 at a time to avoid symptoms flaring. She described this initial round of peptides as a great starting place and good '**all rounder**' to begin with.

**Peptide list:** Thymosin Alpha 1, GHK-cu, Thymosin-Beta 4, KPV, LL-37, BPC-157.  
Basically this list covers immune modulation, anti-inflammatory signalling, cell regeneration (for gut and blood brain barrier) and some antimicrobial benefits from the LL-37.

**How did it affect me?**

Well my worst symptoms (brain fog, fatigue, burning brain feeling, swaying feeling in brain, immune system flairs, food sensitivities, swollen lymph nodes and PEM which was mainly felt above the shoulders) had **reduced** enough for me to exercise atleast 5 days a week. Whereas before, I could only do really light stuff perhaps once to twice a week as the burning brain was really offputting after trying to exercise/overexert. Some light PEM would still come in the form of annoying brain fog, but it would subside much quicker than usual. I actually ran 10km one night which felt pretty incredible.

**Any drawbacks?**

Initially I had some **symptoms** during the introduction phase of some peptides (swollen lymph nodes etc) but wasn't too bad to deal with. I imagine it might be hard for highly senstive people, however dosages can simply be reduced initially for those people

Pricing? This might have been the main drawback for me. You need to make several orders of peptides which was costing me roughly 700AUD per order (I would have completed a larger order if I could afford, but had to break it up)

Lastly, after ceasing to take the peptides after the 3 months, I found that I had gotten sick and felt like that inflammatory cycle had slowly come back a little bit, and I wasn't able to buy more peptides to continue on the seemingly positive trajectory I was on quite yet. So in a perfect world I would have kept going after a little break, but it was pricey for me.

Also some people are scared of injecting, but it honestly became as easy as my morning coffee after a week or so.

**What next?**

Well the general idea with the peptides is to either modify the protocol after 3 months, or complete the same protocol again, as healing takes time. For me, I wanted to work directly on treating any potential root causes, like **SIBO** and the **cell danger response**. To do so, I am taking Low Dose Naltrexone to reduce and symptoms and inflammation. Then once I am at an optimal dosage, I will take FC Cidal and Dysbiocide (antimicrobials) to treat for SIBO (I had a positive test previously).  Then I will start to rebuild the **gut** with probiotics and **prime** the body ready to take some **mitochondrial + metabolism peptides** and **brain repair peptides:** MOTS-c, Selank, 5-Amino-1MQ.

**My explanation for doing the above is this:**

I believe that healing has to cover a few things: First, **symptom reduction.** Because it's so bloody hard to find motivation to heal when you feel like a literal dead corpse and cannot think straight. Then, **treating root causes**: gut issues, inflammatory cell signaling, toxin build up etc. Then finally, **helping the mitochondria** resume their regular energy producing function, rather than stuck in the cell danger response and remaining trapped in an inflammatory feedback loop.  
Again, please take everything with a grain of salt - I know everyone's cases are so different from eachother, and some are much much worse than me.

**You shouldn't take things that are for 'research' because they are understudied and the potential risks are not fully understood.**

Very fair point. My only response is that for me, doing nothing is not something I can do - I hate the feeling so much of my brain feeling like it's gasping for oxygen and on fire that I just have to do try and fix it. Many peptides are naturally occuring or replicas of naturally occuring peptides found in the body. When it comes to peptides that can regenerate cells, of course the questions of how it interacts with cancer always become a topic of discussion, but there hasn't been any evidence yet of this. I just wouldn't personally take the growth hormone stimulating peptides.

Anyway, I hope this post has provided some info and please ask any questions and I will answer all of them!",3,1755488577.0,covidlonghaulers,1,1.0,False

1mtb813,https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/1mtb813/planet_of_island_biomes/,Planet of Island Biomes,"I don't know if anyone will want it or use it, but here I leave you the creation of a planet next to a solar system, as well as with the biosphere and the most special quality of the planet.

Thalasar System

The Thalasar system consists of seven planets in total, with an asteroid belt dividing the group. Of course, the system is mostly made up of gas planets, two of them being gas giants, one with two intersecting rings.

The first of the two rocky worlds in the habitable zone, Thalasar 1 offers little more than a vast reservoir of raw materials. Its atmosphere is a perpetual sea of dense, turbulent clouds, permeated with corrosive compounds that completely envelop the planet, obscuring the surface from direct view. Beneath this opaque blanket, the air is so toxic and reactive that no known life form could survive for more than a few moments. For civilizations, Thalasar 1 is not a possible home, but a mine shrouded in poison and tempest.

It wasn't great news for the population of Aetherium when the planet was revealed. It only sparked some discussions among the scientific community about what life on that planet would be like if it evolved to survive in that environment, but it remained just that: coffee shop debates.

The second rocky planet, Merlin, is a completely strange and fascinating world, where Mother Nature got playful and creative with the planet's design. For the most part, it is covered by a global ocean that, from the surface, resembles an endless desert of ice. The icy layer, several kilometers thick in some places, conceals liquid waters rich in marine life, fed by subsurface hydrothermal vents. However, the true wonder of Merlin lies on its surface, where geography and climate conspire to form vast, isolated oases.

These oases are enormous ""islands"" of land, surrounded by natural walls of stone and mountains that block the icy winds from outside. Each one has its own microclimate and ecosystem, completely different from the rest, like miniature worlds. Some are covered by humid jungles where it rains almost daily, others are endless grasslands bathed in a faint sun, and a few resemble temperate forests filled with crystal-clear rivers and lakes.

Among them all, one stands out for its rarity: the Great Kal'Mareth Desert, an oasis so vast it encompasses an arid biome of golden dunes, salt flats, and rocky canyons, comparable in size to Earth's Gobi Desert. No one knows for sure how such a dry and hot climate can be sustained in the middle of an icy planet; theories range from strange geothermal currents to the presence of ancient alien artifacts altering the local climate. Kal'Mareth is the only desert on the planet.

In Merlin, each oasis is a world of its own, and exploring them is like traveling to a different planet on each trip. The planet's colony is supported by a few cities located in some of the oases. Of course, the settlers got creative with the names of the cities, with the oasis where the city is built taking its name, but with some additions.

For example, the capital city of Merlin was built in a jungle oasis where it rains most of the time, hence its capital city's name, Pluria Magna.

As a general rule throughout Aetherium, cities must adapt to the environment in which they are built. The law establishes that any urban center built in a large, dominant biome must integrate with its natural characteristics, respecting its ecology, climate, and morphology. This implies that architecture, infrastructure, and even the distribution of services must be designed based on the biome, ensuring not only environmental sustainability but also efficient use of resources and harmonious coexistence with the environment.

If the city is located in a forest like Pluria Magna, its architecture is designed so that the city is a new addition to the surrounding biome, without greatly altering the ecosystems.

If Pluvia Magna is the political heart of Merlin, Rhea Maximus is its cultural and economic soul. Erected not from brick or metal, but carved directly from the upper trunks of the colossal wroshy trees, the city rises among canopies that seem to touch the clouds. From a distance, the city is not visible: it blends into the forest itself, as if it were born with it.

Dwellings, temples, and administrative centers are built on ascending levels within and around the giant wroshy, connected by suspension bridges, reinforced glass walkways, and suspended platforms that sway gently in the wind. The interiors are carved directly from the living wood, but the wroshy do not die: Merlin's citizens developed a technique that allows their growth to be molded, so that buildings ""grow"" with the tree rather than destroying it.

Life on Rhea Maximus takes place high above: open plazas at the tops of the trees function as markets, while the intermediate levels are filled with workshops for artisans and traders of the precious wroshy wood, one of the most expensive and sought-after resources in the system. High above, sunlight penetrates between the leaves, allowing adapted crops to thrive on living terraces.

Beneath this aerial city lies the densest and most mysterious forest in Merlin. Its kilometer-long trunks block out almost all natural light, transforming the ground into a realm of twilight. There, evolution took a different path: the flora developed bioluminescence as a means of survival. Smaller trees, fungi, and vines emit green, blue, and violet flashes, illuminating the surroundings like an inverted starry sky.

Some animal species also glow: insects that fly, leaving trails of light, predators with luminous markings that confuse their prey, and even nocturnal birds whose plumage shimmers in hypnotic patterns. Most fauna, however, has adapted to the darkness: enormous eyes, developed auditory senses, and camouflage that blends in with the gloom.

For settlers and travelers, wandering the forest floor is like entering a tangible fantasy world: a landscape where myths of spirits and glowing creatures seem to take on a life of their own. Many consider Rea Forest not just a natural resource, but a living sanctuary, and the relationship between city and environment is deeply spiritual.",1,1755488074.0,worldbuilding,0,1.0,False

After being in a solid 4-year relationship that had to end because AP moved away, I went without having anything serious for nearly 3 years until this past February when i connected with someone on AM.

Chat was amazing from the start; initial pic swap confirmed the mutual attraction; exchanged long emails for a few days then finally met. She was a first timer and was taking a very practical approach, but the conversation was effortless. Met again for a second date the next week. Coffee shop in a small town. The conversation flourished even more.

The next week, we had a third date and that’s when the sparks turned into a full fledge inferno. 

We went to a museum on a major big ten campus on a Saturday afternoon, then found our way into one of the academic buildings; and then in an empty lecture hall, that’s where we had our first kiss… and our first…uh… other stuff…

For the next two months, we met as much as we could… and we had ‘intimate moments’ in hotel rooms, back seats of vehicles and more. We would explore metro parks and find trail ways off the beaten path where no one would see us ‘expressing our feelings for one another.’

The last time we were together, I got a room for two nights, she was able to sleep over. We spent the whole evening together. Then I went home and the next morning, I came back and we hooked up again before I went to work.

Then she went away to visit family.

After a week of exchanging the sexiest texts and voice memos, she messaged me the dreaded words… ‘we need to talk’.

We chatted a little later and she told me that on that last night we spent together she could feel herself on the edge of falling. She didn’t want to fall. She couldn’t afford to fall. She refused to fall (she gave me reasons that I won’t go into here).

Either way, she needed to end it. I thought we could work through it…. after all… I had already fallen. But she was steadfast. And so after a couple more appeals, I stepped back and let her go. 

I cried everyday for a month. It was the deepest connection I had ever had… by far. 

I immediately began chasing that feeling again. 

Then in July, I met someone else from AM. We went on a date after 2 days of chatting. It went great. We made out at the end of the night. A week later we set up another date. The day before the date she messaged me and said she can already feel something for me and that it was scaring her how fast it was happening. I said we could take it slow and postpone the meeting if she wanted to. She said no postponement was necessary. And so we went on a second date.

Time obligations created a smaller window of time for us but it was still a great time together. We planned the next one. A few days before the third date I get a message reiterating her fears. I again assure her that we can take it slow and play it by ear. 

She said okay.

That was the last time i heard from her. 

I understand… but I also don’t understand because for me I’m willing to risk the hurt and the tears for a chance to feel the deep romantic connection… But everyone is different with how they approach this… and I guess I need to accept that…

But two times back to back… the same sentiment… ugh… ",0,1755487813.0,adultery,4,0.43,False

We have been together for about 5 years now and we live together. 

Last week I did not have to work on Tuesday, so I made plans with a child hood friend of mine who i haven’t seen in a long time (it’s a girl he knows). He called when I was about to leave saying he got out of work early and I told him what my plans were and he got kind of upset. I just chalked it up to disappointment at the time but i see now that he was mad. 

When I got to my friend’s house, I was texting him and we were having a normal conversation but I got a notification on messenger from him. I went and looked at it only to see it was a video with the caption “Husband finds out wife is cheating and takes matters into his own hands”. The video then showed the husband shooting the wife and the dude that was with her. I was for real like in shock. Meanwhile he is just texting me like normal on snapchat. I didn’t even know what to say to him about it because it was just so weird. I would like to add that I am not cheating nor have I ever cheated on him so I seriously have no idea why he would send it to me. 

I continued to text him through out the day letting him know what we were doing and what not. We just got lunch and went the Barnes and Noble. He then started questioning why we were at Barnes and Noble for 3 hrs. I just let him know that we found some books, got a coffee and were reading while we were there. He responded with “weird” and i was like okay? 

Fast forward to when we got back to my friends house she asked me if i wanted to bake some cookies with her and stay the night and I was so excited because I have not stayed the night at a friends house or had a girls night since I was in the dorm with my roommates. I called him to let him know what was going on and he absolutely lost it. Like freaking out saying i’ve been acting weird lately and I don’t even care about baking or cooking so what am I actually doing. I asked him what he meant by “I’ve been acting weird lately” and his response was that i’ve been staying out late during the week. The two times he is talking about is family birthday parties which he was invited to but he chose not to come and i understood bc he is tired after work. It turned into a whole argument over the phone I was crying and he was yelling it’s was a mess. He ended up hanging up on me and we were arguing over text after that. 

He ended up going to bed like an hour later and I ended up coming home after my friend fell asleep bc the stress and guilt of him being upset with me was eating me alive. We have still not talked about the video he sent me or this situation because truly I don’t even know what to say. I don’t want to ask him about the video because honestly I am kind of scared but I also don’t want to give him the impression that I am cheating because i have a feeling he is just going to say something like “Well if you aren’t cheating there isn’t a problem”. Honestly I am just kind of confused and like lost with this situation because I can’t go on acting like everything is normal because it’s not. I don’t know how to bring it up or what to do any advice ?

1mtazsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mtazsj/i_broke_things_off_with_someone_and_now_im_having/,"I broke things off with someone and now I""m having second thoughts","We've only been speaking for a couple of weeks. In that short time it has already been an emotional roller-coaster. Things started out sexually charged (won't get into the details but she initially reached out to me and expressed interest in hooking up, she knew we live in the same area). We exchanged numbers and spent a lot of time texting after that, talking about our lives, sharing music, chatting, but also flirting and sexting. We met for coffee, but didn't hook up or anything. She said she had an appointment she had to go to. She texted me later and after chatting a bit starting sending sexy pics and sexting. I kind of enjoyed building things up and taking it sort of slow (for our times anyway) while still having some sexual excitement. 

We continued texting 3-4 days, and things seemed to be going well .She asked me to propose a definite plan for our next meeting/date. I proposed one and thought it was a bit strange how long it was taking her to reply but didn't press on it. The next day she said she wasn't interested anymore, rather curtly. I said okay, and just asked to clarify if that meant no contact at all going forward. A few hours pass (rather long for her to reply based on past texting habits) and she proposes being just friends. I thought about saying yes but then I thought about how the friendship dynamic might be and didn't respond right away. 

After some time passed she apologized, said she just started feeling really dreadful about hooking up in general and hasn't had sex in a while due to past bad experiences. I said that was okay, and that I did not necessarily even assume we'd be hooking up after 2nd date (which was true despite the sexting, of course I thought we might but I thought it was also possible we might just kiss or something not quite sex and leave sex for later, so I guess I did expect something physical tbf but would've been cool with just hanging out and talking again too). So I said why don't we continue but in a more slow/traditional dating situation. She agreed, said how happy she was we were talking again. I thought all was well.

We meet for the second date. Things seems to be going well enough. I will admit a few things kinda rubbed me the wrong way. She expressed great joy in seeing men fight and draw blood (I'll leave out the context since I think she's a redditor), and brought up having a famous ex (maybe this is petty or insecure on my part, I don't think I felt threatened exactly but it seemed a bit strange to bring up this early on to me, maybe I'm overly sensitive or reading too much into it). I don't think we'd set a time limit, she did say before she had some other obligations after but that she was looking forward to more plans. After about an hour, she said she was looking forward to a future plan we'd made, then kinda rushed off with a ""see ya!"". I can't point to one specific thing she did that I felt was wrong, but something about the combination of these things felt off to me. I felt conflicted but had a thought/feeling that maybe I wasn't interested after all.

I didn't text her that evening because of those feelings and I had some plans with a friend. She normally would text at least once every 3 hours or so so I looked for a text from her, but didn't send one myself (maybe I should have? idk). The next day she mentioned was her sabbath and she tries not to text. She had been sending good morning messages most days, but she didn't send one. Although we'd texted on that day the prior week, I felt self conscious about texting her since she mentioned it was the sabbath for her, so I did not text her (thought I did consider it). I decided if she didn't text me good morning the next day (today) I'd consider giving up. She didn't, so about half way through the day I sent her a text. No reply (she normally would reply within 30 minutes an hour unless she mentioned being at work on a specific task or something). I admit I was starting to feel emotional after a couple of hours passed, I decided I wanted to break things off before she does. I waited an hour or so more and then sent a text saying that I enjoyed getting to know her but I didn't feel like things were working out. Her not initiating contact or for the past couple days or replying to this message made me think she may feel the same way. Then some well wishes if we don't speak again. Since then, nothing (as one would expect I suppose). I did notice she seems to have removed all messages and blocked me from the app she originally reached out to me on, so I guess it's final (I am not 100% sure these weren't already deleted, she maybe didn't want the pics or messages saved or shared).

Now I'm having second thoughts. One the one hand it's kind of nice to be off the emotional roller coaster, but I did enjoy talking to her and wonder if maybe we'd be better as friend without the romantic/sexual issues. I am generally very bad at ending things with people and have a desire to keep contact open at all costs unless they've done something I consider very bad, so I'm usually the one ghosted or broken up with. I also think about some of the future plans we'd talked about and how fun they'd be because my other friends aren't into those things. I wonder if I apologized if we could patch things up as friends? or if I even should? Then I think maybe there's a lot I don't know about her and at this point we've already had this many issues so it's probably best to just move on.

My mom and I bought two. We both lit ours at separate ends of the house and couldn't smell anything. Like, when we got right next to the candle we could, but otherwise, it was scentless

Well then in 2024 my mom bought FBC again because she thought that maybe the formula improved since that can happen with re-releases. Went home, burned it, same thing. It smelled like nothing to us

1mtaxw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/auscorp/comments/1mtaxw8/how_do_you_take_leave/,How do you take leave?!,"This week I've taken annual leave for the first time since last December. I'm not doing anything radical, just some odd jobs around the house, getting my car serviced, specialist appointment etc. 

Day 1 hasn't been restful. At 11am I had a call from a project team saying I was needed urgently. It couldn't go to another relevant project person because they were off sick for the day. It couldn't be passed up to my boss because he was on annual leave for the day too. And it couldn't go to one of my two direct reports because they don't have the capability.

I let them know I was in the middle of coffee with a friend and jumped online an hour or so later. It was urgent, sure. But it wasn't difficult. If this team member had looked through the task and thought critically about it, they could have actioned it themselves. I spent an hour on it, told them what they needed to do to wrap up the loose ends, and went back to lounging on the couch. 

I'm firmly of the view that it's the workplace's responsibility to have enough people in a team so that team members can take leave as needed, and additional work can be absorbed. But, since my organisation sacked some casuals in our team, it's getting harder and harder for us to work in that way. 

I spent last week doing extra work to make sure everything would be under control and preparing handover information. I feel like when I get back next Monday, I'll spend the week playing catch up. Leave doesn't actually feel that restful when it's bookended by extra work. 

What do you do to make this more achievable on top of, of course, taking boundaries (I told my team no one was allowed to call me other than my boss. But 11am on Monday and that's already gone out the window). 

Edit: to clarify a few things: 
1. I told my immediate and broader team, my boss is the only one allowed to call me, and only if it's urgent. 

2. They were very, very much aware that I was on leave. I gave some handover info on how to manage certain issues that might pop up while I'm away.

3. I didn't answer my colleagues' call. I sent them to voicemail. They texted saying it was urgent. I said call the boss or this other colleague, turns out, both on leave. I didn't finish the full job they were asking for, just a few steps then told them what they needed to do to wrap it up. I said if there's anything further they needed it'd have to wait until next week. 

4. I guess what I'm asking here is how do you meaningfully take leave when your team is small? We've told the higher ups that because they've cut back our team, that we won't be able to deliver as much in the past, or to the same standards. But in this case, it was them breathing down the neck of my (more junior) colleague to do something asap, that the colleague didn't have experience to do themselves, or the confidence to push back on.

1mtaxqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mtaxqv/my_old_bar_manager_drained_2_years_of_my_life/,My old bar manager drained 2 years of my life,"I worked as a bar hand at a café when I was 23. The job itself wasn’t rocket science (washing dishes, making drinks, toasting sandwiches) but my manager (a woman in her late 40s/50s) made it hell.

She hated working there. She only treated people she felt “close” with decently, and for everyone else, she’d talk absolute shit behind their backs. At first, we got along okay, but then the cracks started showing.

She’d spend her entire shift hiding behind the dish pit while I ran around doing everything else. And she’d unload her entire life onto me while I worked, issues with her husband, her kids, her bills, like I was her therapist. And not just me… she’d complain about her miserable life to 16 and 18-year-old girls who worked part-time there. Imagine being a teenager and having a middle-aged woman trauma-dump about her marriage onto you while you’re trying to pull coffees.

By the end of every shift, I wasn’t just physically exhausted, I was mentally fried. No amount of caffeine could fix it. Eventually, my work started slipping because I was running on autopilot just to survive. That’s when she turned on me. She’d make passive-aggressive “jokes” about me being lazy or useless, then escalate to outright badmouthing me to others. Word spread, and suddenly my GM thought I was terrible at my job.

Then came the kicker: she got into AMWAY. She tried recruiting me, telling me this was my “ticket to real money.” When I refused, she lost it, calling me stupid and dumb to my face for “not wanting more out of life.” For her, literally everything boiled down to money. Her standards in life were so low it was embarrassing.

It got so bad that I finally told my GM: “It’s either her or me.” Things escalated all the way up to the owner. Thankfully, my friends at the café stood by me, and eventually she quit. The vibe instantly got better after she left.

But those 2 years left a mark. I never thought someone so insignificant could chip away at my happiness that much. I look back and wonder why I tolerated it for so long but when you’re just a broke student trying to pay your bills, you do what you have to do.

1mtawqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1mtawqp/dont_really_know_what_to_do_about_an_ex/,Dont really know what to do about an ex.,"Hi. Big toss up here.

Ive had this woman in my life for about a year now. I (29M) met her (38f) on a dating app. We hit it off and moved a little too fast.

Im a super loyal person. Ive only been with a small handful of people. Im selective and very hesitant. I wont go into that here and now. lol.

We had a discussion about friends and what not within our first month or so of dating. I gave her a general tour of all my friends and how I knew them and she did the same. She mentioned shes still friends with her highschool ex boyfriend and has another friend in the Israeli army. I didnt really pay a mind to it. Found the highschool ex a tad bit weird. But still didnt really care. These obviously werent the only friends she mentioned, just the ones to note.
A week or so after that she told me the friend in the Israeli army is an ex she dated Summer of 2024. Shortly before meeting me. They broke up in September. But keep in touch via email.

I raised a slight eye brow. Asked her what was the plan when he comes to the US next summer again. She said he'll go to Florida because thats where hes from. I didnt really pay a mind further. Keep in mind, this was about a month into the relationship.

Then about 2 months in she tells me she slept with her highschool ex boyfriend about a month before meeting me.

She also mentions that they have rules and boundaries they go by and she plans on meeting him for coffee whenever hes in town which is a couple times a year or so.

At this point, I just started packing up my stuff. I had met a couple of her close friends, her coworkers and her whole family. The whole thing felt confusing so I said I was done.

She then jumped on top of me and tackled me to the ground. Granted shes only like 100 pounds but i kinda fell. and she told me to stay and that I have no idea how hard its been without me here.

She then proceeded to tell me she chooses me over and over again and she loves me and that im this whole entire person she never thought shed meet in her life. But wont not meet her highschool ex boyfriend for coffee when hes in town. i gave a lot of resistance to this. Its not like they have a kid together or any obligations. its just a meet up for pleasure. she wanted me to go too, but why? the whole time im just like whats the big deal and why?

It put a major damper on the relationship because we just kept fighting over and over again. I couldnt understand the fight and resistance for her to meet someone for coffee once a year. And if im this special whatever person, why are we letting this 1 hour event destroy our whole relationship?

She couldnt understand that i would let a 1 hour meet up with a friend maybe once a year could be a big enough deal for me to want to pay a mind to it, because im the one she chooses.

We ended up breaking up a few months later. The ex from Israel came to town for the summer and they started seeing each other. A month or so after that occurrence, she contacted me to re-kindle things. I agreed.

Things were great for about a month. Then we had a situation pop up where she tells me shes still just friends with her ex now and recently drove him to go take some kind of a test. I kinda just was like fuck this.. nothing changed.. and ended it again.

Now im alone again. Wondering did she love me and am I an idiot? Or is she just extremely manipulative, insecure, and selfish and just wanted me around to have her cake and eat it too. dont get me wrong im insecure too. ive made my mistakes. for sure.

Also i have C-PTSD and that tense feeling in my muscles eased up a little.

I told her I’m lactose intolerant and still eat dairy so I can’t pinpoint the cause of symptoms however there were times I’ve cut it out briefly and still had issues. They sent blood panels for crohn’s, ulcerative colitis and celiac. The latter I’m still waiting on. I read on the IBD subreddit that blood tests for IBD’s are merely suggestive while colonoscopies/biopsies are confirmation. However reading here, I’m under the impression that blood tests for celiac are more definitive compared to the former though and endoscopy is still encouraged.

In any case; I’ve been trying to take note of how I reacted after eating certain foods this week and I’m starting to think the celiac diagnosis is more solid than I originally suspected. But first I wanna lay down the blood markers I’ve had thus far related to inflammation and gut disorder. 

ESR: 55mm/hr. 3 years ago it was 67

C-Reactive Protein: 11 mg/L

S Cerevisiae IgG 32 units. IgA negative 

Nothing conclusive but still had bits of inflammation for years but I’ve been overweight literally my whole life so I’ve often been told that can contribute. 

Anyway, I’ve noticed this week that I’ve had strong reactions to meals with gluten but little to no reaction to dairy consumption! The log goes:

8/11

Ate hot dog with soda for lunch

Bloating and gut pains then diarrhea after, stools were dark 

More bloating and mild nausea 

8/12

Eat rice with meat and salad

Stomach rumbling, pain 

8/16

Coffee with milk and potatoes with cheese and sour cream for breakfast, no reaction

Pho (noodle soup) with water 

10-15 min later cramping, gas, desire to poop


CAVA(rice and meat with salad) with pita chips 
No reaction 
8/17

Breakfast:

Leftover CAVA with a sip of coffee, water
No reaction


4 pm

Sushi with Pepsi



6-8 pm

Stomach pains

Groggy 

Salmon with rice and green beans 

9pm

More cramps, diarrhea 

Feeling run down

The idea:

* Toss one in your bag, add to any espresso/coffee on the go.
* Always the right amount (no more “oops, too sweet”), great for starter espresso/coffee lovers.
* Fresh every time

I’m making some batches at home right now for R&D, but before I go too deep… I’d love to know:

I haven't been able to sleep well. I guess reality is finally starting to finally kick in, and I have to accept that he's truly gone and won't come back. I guess in a small part of my heart I was clinging on to the possibility of him returning. 

Today I hung out with my friends, though. I hadn't seen one of them in years, and the other one I hadn't seen in more than a year. We drank some coffee and walked around our town's mall. Then we played cards until it was time to go. 

One of my ex's hobbies is Magic, so cards always remind me of him. But maybe instead of thinking of him when I play cards, I'll think of my friends. We laughed a lot and had fun. They were very supportive. We're going to hang out on Sundays biweekly. 

When I returned from the mall I cried during the car ride. I miss him so much. 

I still haven't been able to eat a full meal. I feel nauseous all the time. Sometimes I cry so hard that I start gagging and throwing up. 

Before I met him I had 2 boyfriends. One of them I lasted with for a month, the other one a couple of weeks. I cried and felt ""depressed"" after breaking up with them, but lately I've been thinking that those moments truly were  nothing compared to the pain I'm feelings right now. Those breakups were child play. 

I miss him so much. I miss his smile. God I was so in love with his smile. I miss his messy hair. I miss his lips. I miss his hands. I miss his warmth. I miss holding him. 

But he probably isn't missing me like I miss him. He isn't crying like I am.

# Best Cream Washable Rugs 2025: Reviews & Top Picks

cream washable rugs offer a blend of style and practicality, making them a popular choice for homeowners seeking a light and airy aesthetic without the worry of challenging cleaning. these rugs provide a neutral canvas that complements a variety of décor styles, from modern minimalist to cozy farmhouse. The washable aspect is especially appealing to families with children, pet owners, or anyone who wants to maintain a clean and fresh living space with minimal effort. In 2025, advancements in materials and manufacturing techniques continue to improve the durability, softness, and overall quality of cream washable rugs, solidifying their place as a staple in contemporary homes. This review explores some of the best options available, highlighting their key features, benefits, and suitability for different needs and preferences.

## Key Features Analysis

The best cream washable rugs of 2025 boast several key features that set them apart from traditional rugs and less advanced washable options. These features primarily revolve around durability, washability, softness, and aesthetic appeal.

**material Composition:** The most durable and washable cream rugs are typically made from synthetic fibers like polyester or polypropylene. These materials are naturally stain-resistant and hold up well to repeated washing. High-quality options employ specialized weaving techniques to create a dense pile that resists shedding and wear.

**Weaving Technique:** Machine-loomed rugs frequently enough provide a balance of affordability and durability, while hand-tufted rugs offer a more luxurious feel and intricate designs. Regardless of the method, rugs with a higher knot count tend to be more resilient and less prone to flattening over time. The density of the weave impacts how well the rug maintains its shape and appearance after multiple washes.

**Backing Material:** A non-slip backing is essential for safety and convenience, particularly on hard floors. Options range from rubberized backings to thermoplastic elastomers (TPE), both of which offer excellent grip. The backing material should also be durable enough to withstand washing without crumbling or deteriorating. Some rugs feature a separate, removable rug pad for added cushioning and protection.

**Stain Resistance Technology:** Many cream washable rugs are treated with stain-resistant coatings that prevent spills from penetrating the fibers. This makes cleanup easier and reduces the need for frequent washing. Look for OEKO-TEX certification to ensure that the stain-resistant treatments are free from harmful chemicals and safe for your family and pets.

**Size and Shape variety:** top brands offer cream washable rugs in a wide range of sizes and shapes to accommodate different room layouts and design preferences. From small accent rugs to large area rugs, you can find options to fit living rooms, bedrooms, kitchens, and even outdoor spaces. Round, rectangular, square, and runner shapes are commonly available, allowing for versatile placement.

**Color and Pattern Options:** While the primary color is cream, these rugs often feature subtle patterns and textures that add visual interest. Options range from simple geometric designs to intricate floral motifs. Some rugs incorporate variations in pile height to create a dimensional effect. The dye used should be fade-resistant to ensure that the color remains vibrant after repeated washing.

## Core Benefits

Cream washable rugs offer a multitude of practical benefits that make them an attractive choice for modern homes. These benefits extend beyond aesthetics, addressing key concerns like hygiene, convenience, and long-term cost savings.

**Enhanced Hygiene:** The ability to easily wash these rugs is a major advantage, especially for households with children, pets, or allergy sufferers. Regular washing removes dust mites, allergens, and bacteria that can accumulate in traditional rugs, promoting a healthier indoor environment.This is particularly beneficial for individuals with sensitivities to dust and mold.

**Easy Maintenance:** Traditional rugs often require professional cleaning or spot treatments, which can be costly and time-consuming. Cream washable rugs can be easily cleaned in a standard washing machine,saving you time,effort,and money. Simply toss the rug in the machine and follow the manufacturer's instructions for washing and drying.

**Stain and Spill Resistance:** The combination of stain-resistant materials and washability makes these rugs virtually impervious to everyday spills and stains. Whether it's coffee spills, pet accidents, or muddy footprints, these rugs can be easily cleaned without leaving behind unsightly marks. This helps to maintain their pristine appearance for longer.

**Versatile Style:** Cream is a neutral color that complements a wide range of décor styles, from modern and minimalist to traditional and bohemian.A cream washable rug can serve as a versatile foundation for your room's design, allowing you to easily change accessories and furniture without clashing with the rug.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** While the initial cost of a cream washable rug may be slightly higher then a traditional rug, the long-term cost savings can be notable. The durability of the materials, combined with the ease of cleaning, means that these rugs are less likely to require replacement or professional cleaning, making them a cost-effective choice over time.## FAQs Section

**Can I put my cream washable rug in the dryer?**
it depends on the manufacturer's instructions. Some rugs can be tumble-dried on low heat, while others should be air-dried to prevent damage to the backing. Always check the care label before drying your rug. Air drying is generally recommended to extend the lifespan of the rug.

**Will the color of my cream washable rug fade after washing?**
High-quality rugs use fade-resistant dyes that hold up well to repeated washing.However, it's always best to wash your rug in cold water and avoid using harsh detergents or bleach. Following the manufacturer's instructions will help to minimize fading and maintain the color vibrancy of your rug.

**Are cream washable rugs safe for pets?**
Yes, most cream washable rugs are made from pet-pleasant materials that are non-toxic and easy to clean. The stain-resistant properties also make them ideal for households with pets, as they can easily withstand accidents. Look for rugs with a durable backing that can withstand scratching and chewing.

**How often should I wash my cream washable rug?**
The frequency of washing depends on the level of traffic and the presence of pets or children. In general, it's recommended to wash your rug every 1-3 months to maintain its cleanliness and hygiene. However, you may need to wash it more frequently if it's exposed to heavy traffic or spills.Spot clean as needed between washes.## Competitor Comparison

She’s the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

**What I’m Looking For:**  
I’m searching for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, slow-burn story about love, and neglect.. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer—whatever feels right. The key is that he’s lost in his own world, too caught up in the demands of his fame to see how much he’s hurting the only person who’s never wanted anything from him but love.

Kill my best friend with the knife I was using to cut my birthday cake. 

I didn’t act on it. 

I never would have. 

But that didn’t stop the image from seeping in, fogging my brain. 

Around me, voices sang happy birthday in a shaky symphony. 

Balloons bobbed in the air, food covered the table, and my father smiled proudly at me. 

The other kids' voices blurred into white noise, and the knife suddenly felt too heavy, too sharp, clenched tightly in my hand. I stood grinning at the cake, ready to blow out the candles. Then my gaze snagged on the girl across from me. 

That thought turned vivid: how easy it would be to drag the blade across her throat. Two strokes, maybe three. 

Hardly any mess. 

And if there was, the tablecloth could hide it.

Once the thought rooted itself in my skull, it refused to leave. 

Slowly, I lifted my eyes to my father.

The adults would be harder. They would fight back. 

My wandering gaze found his tie tucked into his collar, and I knew exactly how to asphyxiate the breath from his lungs. 

I knew every weak spot. 

Suddenly, their voices were too loud. 

I hated them. 

I hated their stupid singing, and I wanted it to stop. 

My grip tightened on the knife. 

So easy, I thought dizzily, my mind foggy and distant.

It would be so easy to kill them ALL. 

I saw it so vividly, images bleeding effortlessly into my brain.

I was supposed to cut the cake, I told myself. And the cake was so pretty. 

My favorite color. 

Twelve flickering candles smothered in orangeade light. 

I started to move toward it, unaware that my fingers were stroking the serrated edge of the blade, slicing my skin. 

It didn’t hurt. If anything, the sudden buzz of pain encouraged my thoughts.

“Matilda?” My best friend’s voice sounded far away. 

I became aware of my happy smile twisting into disgust. I hated her. 

The knife felt so right pressed against my palm, and I wanted to make her hurt. 

I wanted her to stop smiling. 

I don’t know how much time passed before the singing stopped and the other kids backed away with their parents. 

I flinched when warm hands wrapped around mine, slowly pulling the knife from my trembling fist. 

Blinking rapidly, all the color bled back into the world. 

My father knelt in front of me, his eyes so sad I wanted to cry. 

Before he could speak, I sucked in a breath and stumbled back, my gaze fixed on the knife. I didn’t have to say anything. We both knew.

My hand stung now, the pain sharp and cutting. I stared at the red pooling across my palm. No matter what Dad told me, or my therapist, I thought it was beautiful.

Blood oozing and pooling and trickling, spattering and painting skin, walls, carpet, flooring,

Blood.

Exploding and imploding from the backs of heads, dripping from noses and lips, tainting flesh.

It was beautiful.

I didn’t care what anyone else said, my mind was too far gone, too intrusive and powerful over my sense of being.

The thought of slashing my best friend’s throat and painting my birthday cake a glorious, startling red filled me with an emotion I didn’t yet understand. 

Still, as quickly as the thoughts came, they slipped away, leaving me sick to my stomach, brandishing a knife like I wanted to hurt someone. 

I will never forget the look on my best friend’s face. Her wide eyes, her twisted lips. She was terrified of me, and there was no way to undo that.

Six moves. Six towns. Each time, I thought I was okay.

I thought the thoughts wouldn’t return. But I was naïve. They always came back. And that was enough to send me spiraling.

“Daddy?” My voice was soft. My fingers felt raw without the knife.

I choked on a sob. “Did I do it again?”

“No! No, of course not! It was just a slip-up, okay? You’re okay, sweetie. I promise.”

Dad was too quick to reply. He was already turning to apologize to the party guests.

“I’m so sorry.” His voice was like a blade sliding into my brain. “My daughter… she… suffers from a condition.”

The guests murmured among themselves.

“Condition?” Mrs. Leela, my best friend’s mom, let out a horrified laugh. “You call that a condition? She needs to be hospitalized!”

Before my dad could answer, she was dragging her daughter away.

The others followed, muttering words I didn’t fully understand. Psychosis. Schizophrenic. Nutcase.

No matter how hard I tried to push away the thought, I wanted to hold the knife. 

When I pressed my head into my lap, Dad’s arms wrapped around me, pulling me into his chest. 

He shook his head, whispering that it hadn’t happened again, that it never would. But I knew better.

I knew it would. 

Because even pressed against his jacket, which smelled like cologne and home, my body trembled with the urge to do the unthinkable. 

He’s weak, my mind whispered. It’s the perfect time to attack. 

Dad told me it was okay to raise my arms and hug him back, but I wouldn’t allow myself. 

Because I knew if I freed my arms, if I relaxed my muscles, they would go around his neck, snapping it without a second thought.

. 

Six weeks ago, I was sitting in a coffee shop with my housemates.

I can’t remember what I was working on. My laptop sat open, abandoned hours ago. 

Freddie, my housemate, sat opposite me, eyes glued to his phone. 

I was staring into the dregs of my coffee when Freddie’s boyfriend, Isaac, finally slumped into a chair, throwing an arm around him. “Brainwashing support group, huh.” He leaned back, brow raised. 

“That's ominous.”

That caught my attention.

I lifted my gaze. “What?”

Isaac pointed behind me. “Looks like the freshmen are playing weird shit again...""

His voice faded as I twisted in my chair to look at the poster. 

It looked new, printed in Times New Roman:

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN BRAINWASHED?

Underneath:

For support, come join us at the campus library.

We’re a small group, and we share stories. 

Our aim is to find survivors willing to tell their story.

“Mattie?”

Freddie’s low murmur pulled me back, though the words on the poster kept burning in my mind. 

We left the café, my housemates chatting between themselves.

But I was trapped in the past, old memories bleeding back to life.

I wasn’t even aware that I had stopped walking, like my body had taken over.

“Hey, I’m gonna head to campus to study,” I heard myself say.

Freddie stopped, turning to look at me. “Are you okay? You seem… off.”

“Tired,” I said.

“Tired?” He looked skeptical. “Did all that espresso go straight to your brain?”

I groaned. “I’m fine. Go on ahead.”

They exchanged glances. 

“Sure,” Freddie rolled his eyes, “Have fun.”

The two of them walked away, Issac dragging my roommate into a run. 

Initially, I had no idea where I was going. 

I stopped in front of the campus library, its tall, shadowed facade looming over me. 

I had always thought of it as a safe place, though not tonight. 

Warm light spilled across the walkway as I stepped toward the doors, ready to pull them open and escape inside. 

That’s when I noticed him, a figure leaning casually against the wall. 

As I drew closer, his features sharpened into focus, a guy about my age, thick brown hair falling into his eyes, a trench coat thrown over jeans and a simple tee.

A crumbling cigarette dangled between his fingers, smoke curling lazily into the air. 

He had just enough of a striking presence to make me hesitate. 

I turned toward the door, ready to slip inside, but at the last second I faltered. 

To avoid looking obvious, I pulled out my phone and pretended to check a message.

“Your phone isn’t on, genius.”

The guy surprised me with a gruff laugh. He was right. My phone had died halfway through my study session.

Choosing to ignore him, I shoved my phone in my pocket. “Are you going in?”

When he turned to me, the building’s light casting his face in sharp relief, something inside me snapped. Fight or flight surged through my veins. 

His lips curved around the cigarette, and I couldn’t look away, mesmerized by the fluidity of his movements and the glint in his eyes. A glint that was far too familiar.

I knew that smile. I knew those sharp, precise motions. 

My mind felt like it was unraveling. 

Until this moment, it was as if he had chosen to hide himself. 

My body moved before my brain caught up. I stumbled back, breath stolen from my lungs, and in a blur of unnatural speed, he grabbed me and slammed me against the wall. 

“Do you know how many fucking colleges we’ve been to?” he gasped through a hysterical giggle that didn’t match his eighteen-year-old voice. 

He carried the childlike innocence of an eight-year-old trapped in a grown body, but that psychotic smile, the one I knew so well, twisted his lips.

“Every college town, every university you can imagine. Searching for you. And here you are.” His breath tickled my face. 

“I didn’t think you were stupid enough, but here you are. Hook, line, and sinker.”

So close. I knew exactly how to get away. One jerk of my hand, and I could break his neck.

But I couldn’t move.

Then came the sound of running footsteps, ghosting closer, dancing toward me, and a single, horrifying thought struck me.

They’ve found me.

The guy stepped closer, one hand slamming me against the rough brick, his fingers digging into my throat. “Ma-til-da,” he hissed, spitting each letter in my face. 

His smile twisted, more maniacal by the second. Leaning in further, his breath was ice cold, buckling my knees. 

“I’m *sorry*, I must be going fucking insane! Correct me if I'm wrong, but do you not remember our *orders*?”

His words were enough to bring memories back, sharp and cruel, slicing into me.

Reminding me why I tried to kill my friends at my twelfth birthday party, and why I had been in solitary confinement for a whole year.

Elementary school.

I lost my mind in elementary school.

I remember walking into class with a bounce in my step. It was spring, and I was enjoying the cherry blossoms outside. 

I spent the last ten minutes running around, trying to catch petals in my cupped hands until Dad told me to head inside. I wasn’t expecting a new teacher when I slumped into my seat. 

I was used to Mrs. Clarabelle, who wore pretty dresses and had rainbow-colored hair that smelled like apples. 

Instead of her, a stranger stood at the front of the class, and from my classmates’ expressions, none of them knew who she was.

She didn’t look like a teacher. Unlike Mrs. Clarabelle’s extravagantly colored dresses, this woman wore a black suit. Her hair was in a strict ponytail, and a pair of Ray-Bans pinned back her fringe. 

Ross Torres leaned across his desk, eyes wide. “Are you a secret agent?”

I had to agree. 

She really did look like a secret agent. 

I loved watching spy movies, so it was jarring to sit right in front of one. 

When the woman’s lip quirked into a slight smile, I relaxed in my chair.

“No,” she said warmly, before turning to the whiteboard and grabbing a pen. “But I will be your teacher starting today.”

“Where’s Mrs. Clarabelle?” Ross pulled a face, leaning back. “She was my favorite! I don’t want her to goooooo.”

“Yeah!” Evie Clare joined in, standing with her arms folded. If there was a social hierarchy in elementary school, Evie was at the top. I usually stayed away from her. 

Her parents were rich, and she often looked down on other kids who weren’t as well dressed. 

She had her own little group of minions who followed her like she was a queen. 

When Evie stood, she spoke for the class, like she had when Mrs. Clarabelle banned Tamagotchis. 

Evie had led a rebellion, convincing us to refuse lunch if we weren’t allowed Tamagotchis. Surprisingly, the ban was lifted.

“This girl is like our third-grade class spokesperson,” I thought.

“We don’t know who you are, you could be a stranger,” Evie said. “Where’s Mrs. Clarabelle? She is our teacher.”

Something darkened in the woman’s eyes, and she cleared her throat.

“Please sit down. I will explain once you take your seat.” She cleared her throat again. “Also, I am not stupid. Young lady, I can see the candy under your desk.”

Her gaze flitted to Ross. “And yours.” She held out her hand. “Throw it in the trash, please. I do not allow candy in my classroom.”

The two of them complied. Evie took dramatic strides, pretending to toss gold-plated candy into the trash, but she got rid of it.

“Okay, now that’s taken care of!” I watched our new teacher write: Hello! My name is Mrs. Hanna! followed by a giant smiley face. Underneath: Can you tell me your names?

“Mrs Hanna.” Evie raised her hand, a sly smile on her lips. “The smile on the smiley face is wonky.”

“So?” Ross turned to her with a grin. “Why do you care, weirdo?”

“Because.” Evie slapped her desk. “I don’t like wonky things. That smile is wonky. I want her to change it.”

Mrs Hanna nodded. “Right. I’m sorry, Evie.” She winked, wiped away the smile with a flick of her finger, and redrew it. “Or should I call you Princess Evie?”

She laughed when Evie looked startled, then did a dramatic spin to face all of us.

“Okay! As I said, I need your names, don’t I?” She pointed to the back row. “Do you want me to start calling you names that pop into my head?”

“No!” we all shouted back.

“Well, hurry!” Mrs Hanna had an energy our old teacher didn’t. Mrs Clarabelle had been sweet and quiet. 

Mr Hanna was more daring, making classes a lot more fun. 

Instead of planting flowers and singing songs, we were allowed to scream. 

She pointed right at me.

“You’re… Ozzy, right?” She chuckled, moving on to Mara Highcliffe behind me. “And you look like a Benny Two Shoes.”

Evie pointed to herself. “What about me?”

“Pegasus.”

The girl giggled, then slammed her hand over her mouth in mock horror. “Pegasus is a stupid name!”

“What about me?” Ross jumped up, raising his arm. “Can I have a funny name?”

Mrs Hanna turned to him, her lip curling. “Hmm.” She pretended to think, tapping her chin. “Phoenix!”

The classroom erupted with laughter, kids yelling their real names, and I joined in, shouting mine along with the others.

“Ross!”
“Mara!”
“Sadie!”
“Evie!”
“Jasper!”
“Pippa!”
“Matilda!”

I cupped my mouth to make sure I was loud enough. Ozzy was a cool name.

Nodding to each of us, Mrs Hanna covered the whiteboard with all of our names, then put the lid back on the pen. 

""It's nice to meet all of you!"" 

And so her classes began. 

The best part was that Mrs Hanna didn’t make us do proper work.

Instead, we had to focus hard to read what was written on a blank piece of paper. 

Initially, I couldn’t read it. 

None of us could, no matter how hard we squinted and flipped the paper over, frowning at it from different angles. 

Mrs Hanna reassured us we were close.

I was never close.

The paper hurt my head.

“Practice makes perfect!” she would always sing when kids started to cry with frustration. 

I will say it started to get painful. 

The girl sitting behind me, Pippa, began complaining her head hurt, followed by other kids. 

But with the pain came clarity. 

One day, Pippa jumped up, raising her hand, her lips split with glee.

“Mrs Hanna!” she squealed, waving the paper in the air. 

Every day we were expected to spend at least an hour trying to read the paper. None of us had even come close. 

We only got headaches. Adam Moore got a nosebleed.

Pippa wasn’t exactly the smartest in the class. She thought Canada was the capital of Australia. 

So, we were all surprised when she jumped from her desk, swiping at her head. 

Twisting around in my chair to look at her, I could tell from the crinkle between her brows and the slight curl in her lip that she was in pain.

“I did it!” she squealed, attracting Mrs Hanna’s attention.

The teacher straightened up from where she had been helping Eleanor Chase. 

She raised her hand, quieting the classroom from the buzz of chatter following Pippa’s announcement. 

“Oh?” Mrs Hanna’s eyes glittered, her pearly smile widening.

“What does it say, Pippa?”

I hadn’t noticed how pale the girl was until I looked at her properly. 

“It says…” Pippa cleared her throat dramatically, making sure everyone was listening and that she was the center of attention. I didn’t like Pippa. 

She pretended to be the smarty-pants, despite knowing all her test answers were wrong. 

I couldn’t help feeling jealous.

“It says…” Pippa dragged out the words, giggling.

“She’s taking too long,” Ross grumbled in front of me. When he caught my eye, he looked equally annoyed.

“Yeah, I bet she’s lying,” Evie said loudly, sticking out her tongue at Pippa. 

“Can you tell us? We’re getting bored.” The girl mimed a yawn, and the rest of the class giggled. “Unless you’re lying, Pippa.”

Pippa’s eyes narrowed. “I’m not lying!”

“Then tell us what it says!” Evie’s lip curled. “You’re just pretending to be dramatic. I know your game.”

“Evie, that’s enough.” Mrs Hanna shot her a look, and Evie backed down, turned around in her chair, and huffed loudly. The teacher’s attention flicked back to Pippa.

“Alright, what does it say? You can tell the whole class, sweetie. Don’t worry. They’ll be able to see it soon.”

Nodding, Pippa showed us the blank piece of paper. “It says we’re going to be doing something really special!”

“What does that mean?” Ross asked, frowning.

Mrs Hanna pretended to zip her lips. “Well, I’m not supposed to tell you, but…”

She leaned forward, and so did we, eagerly.

“You’re going to have a special class,” she whispered. “I’m not supposed to tell you, so you have to be quiet!”

Her words confused me. “Who are you not supposed to tell?” I asked, cocking my head.

Mrs Hanna’s gaze found mine, and for the first time I saw them as piercing. “Do you want to be in the special class or not, Matilda?”

I shrugged, my cheeks blazing when my classmates giggled.

“Yes,” I whispered.

“Okay. Well, special children do not ask questions that do not concern them. Do you understand, Matilda?”

Ducking my head, I nodded. “Yes, Mrs Hanna.”

With the promise of an extra special class if we all managed to see through the invisible paper, our class tried harder. 

There were more headaches, more nosebleeds, and crying, before Ross jumped up from his chair one day, practically vibrating with glee. 

I think he was so excited he didn’t notice blood dripping down his chin.

Mrs. Hanna cleaned him up and praised him, promising him and the other kids that they could go on the field trip.

Evie was next. Of course she was. The girl was super dramatic, twirling in her dress, claiming she was the best because she didn’t suffer a headache or a nosebleed. 

I did, however, glimpse her shoving bloody tissue paper into the trash during recess.

I started to notice a change in the kids who had begun to see the hidden message on the paper—and in the rest of us who were still struggling.

Pippa had grown unusually silent since announcing she could read the paper. 

Mrs. Hanna had given her extra work to do, but every time I slipped past her to go to the bathroom, I noticed she wasn’t even writing. Her eyes were half-lidded, her lips set in a dreamy smile.

Pippa could see something I couldn’t. Swallowing a thick paste that crept up my throat, I realized her expression scared me. It reminded me of my mom’s when I said goodbye to her four years ago. 

Mom didn't even made eye contact—just grasped my hand and muttered my name.

Needless to say, I really didn’t want to be left out of the special class.

Despite my classmates acting weird, I forced myself to break through the barrier. 

She explained that there was a barrier inside every brain. 

To make it easier to understand, she did a theatrical re-enactment—extra goofy, of course.

Mrs. Hanna stood in front of a desk and made a dramatic face. 

“This,” she said, tapping the wooden surface, “is your brain, everyone!”

We all laughed, and she rolled a chair into place. “And this? This is the barrier keeping you from reaching your potential? That’s what I want you to do with your paper. Imagine breaking the barrier so you can see the desk clearly.”

“Breaking the chair!” We all sang as our teacher jumped onto the desk and pumped her arms. “Breaking the chair!”

So that’s what I did.

Or I tried to. I was one of the last ones to break through the barrier. 

One night, I asked Dad if he could help me solve a problem. 

Mrs. Hanna told us not to tell our parents about the fun games we were playing, so I asked him about a particularly hard math sum. He looked up from his laptop, offering a pensive smile over his coffee.

“Try relaxing your mind and thinking about something else,” Dad said. 

“And then, who knows? Maybe if you put less strain on yourself, it might come to you?” He pulled a face. “I can give you the answer if you want.”

I did exactly what Dad told me: I didn’t think about the blank piece of paper all night, and during normal classes, I pushed it out of my head.

At recess, there was nobody to play with anymore. 

The kids who could read the message stayed in class, staring into thin air. 

Sometimes Mrs. Hanna brought people in to talk to them. 

They weren’t teachers—I didn’t know who they were.

All of them had scary faces and were my dad’s age. 

I watched them poke and prod my classmates, asking questions like, “Are you able to see this?” while holding several blank pieces of colored cards. 

Ross, Evie, and the others nodded, while Mrs. Hanna stood by with an odd look on her face.

I decided that day I would become like them. 

I wouldn’t be left out like the other two kids. 

So I slumped down at my desk, put my head down, and glared at the paper until a dull pain blossomed behind my eyes, the lights above me suddenly far too bright.

Blank. 

I stared harder.

Blank!

I gritted my teeth so hard I could taste rusty coins at the back of my mouth.

Getting progressively more frustrated, I decided to pretend I didn’t care, just like when my PlayStation didn’t work and I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for the game to load. 

Trying the same tactic, I clenched my fists and mentally told the piece of paper I didn’t care. I was through caring. 

Stubbornly, I sat with my arms folded, staring into the backs of my eyes, before deciding I had spent enough time ignoring the paper. 

Cracking one eye open, I expected to find the same blank sheet in front of me. However, this time the paper wasn’t blank.

I was half-aware of rivulets of sharp, startling red spotting pallid white.

“You’re in the special class!”

Dad was right. Ignoring my own blood staining the collar of my shirt and pooling on my desk, my lips split into a grin.

It was trying too hard, forcing it, that had been stopping me.

Once I told everyone I could see the paper, I was let into the secret group. 

This time we had to visualize certain things in front of us.

It started with a stuffed animal. 

That was easy. I could visualize it perfectly, until I could reach out and touch its prickly fur. It felt real, like I was touching a real stuffed toy. 

Then the images started to get blurry, and I lost track of the time. 

So did the sessions. 

I remembered the start of them, but time seemed to pass quickly. 

Before I knew it, I was sitting in the back of Dad’s car, trying to remember what I had been doing all afternoon. 

Still, I was happy I broke through the barrier.

I did start getting nosebleeds a lot. Also falling asleep and forgetting things. 

I remember sitting in front of the TV watching SpongeBob, but the next thing I knew, I was halfway down our driveway, and Dad’s hand was on my shoulder.

“Mattie!” It was his third attempt at shouting my name, and finally his voice slid into my brain. I awoke barefoot, my soles on prickly concrete that felt like an anchor, something I could hold onto.

I wanted to tell Dad about the sessions, but Mrs. Hanna had made us promise not to tell our parents. 

Dad didn’t want to send me to school the next morning. 

He said I could stay home and watch cartoons. 

But I didn’t want to miss out on the extra class. 

So, despite feeling like crap, I insisted I was okay and told him to drive me to school.

Ross was standing outside, though his expression was scary. 

He didn’t look at me when I asked if he was okay, and his nose was bleeding.

“Ross?” I prodded him. 

Again, he didn’t respond.

“Ross.” I shoved him, and finally he turned to me. I expected him to at least hit me playfully.

“I don't feel well,” he mumbled. “I want to go home.”

I giggled. “Well that means I'm stronger than you!”

His eyes narrowed. “No you're not. You're a girl.”

I flicked him on the nose, expecting my friend to push me back, laughing. 

Except he didn’t smile. Instead, Ross swiped at his nose, turned away, and strode into school, clutching his backpack.

When I followed him inside, Ross had stopped on the threshold. 

For the first time in a while, he looked confused, his gaze on our chaotic classroom. 

Pippa was standing on the desk, waving her arms and laughing, and Evie was screaming at her to get down, the rest of the kids trying to egg them into fighting. 

For a moment I was confused why the classroom was so crazy—and then my gaze found the empty space where Mrs. Hanna should have been. Mrs. Hanna was never late.

Ross found his desk quickly, and I followed, slumping into my own. 

I twisted around to ask Mara what was happening before the door flew open, crashing into the wall. 

Mrs. Hanna stepped into the classroom, and immediately Pippa hopped off the desk and Evie backed into her seat, her eyes wide.

Mrs. Hanna didn’t comment on the fighting. 

Instead, she strode to the front of the class without a word, picked up a whiteboard pen, and began to write with enough vigor to scare us into silence. 

She wrote one word in block capitals, spanning the entire board:

CHEATER.

When she turned to us, I realized she didn’t look as tidy as usual. 

Mrs. Hanna was wearing the same pantsuit from the day before, her usual ponytail falling out, tangled strands in her eyes. 

She hit the board three times, and we all jumped.

“I would like you to tell me what a cheater is.” Her voice was different—low, a lot scarier. I had grown used to her laughter.

Now, though, it was like looking at a different person. 

I could tell the others didn’t want to speak in fear of being shouted at, but Ross Torres was brave, no matter how scary our teacher was. 

Leaning back in his chair, he cleared his throat.

“It’s an animal, right?” He gave a nervous giggle. “They like… run fast.”

We all jumped when she hit the board again.

“No!” Mrs. Hanna’s expression was fuming. “No, that is not what a cheater is.”

She turned back to the board. “A cheater is a lying son of a—” 

She caught herself when Evie giggled. 

It took her a moment to get hold of herself before turning her attention back to us.

“They said it’s impossible to train young children. And yet… here I am.” She began pacing.

“He said it was morally wrong.” Mrs. Hanna’s eyes locked on mine, her lips curling into a smile that made my stomach churn. 

“But why would I waste it, hmm? Why would I waste weeks, no, months, of shaping young minds for nothing?”

I had no idea what she was talking about. 

I watched her go back and forth, entranced by her movements.

She was muttering to herself. 

“I won’t get in trouble because I’m going to fucking die, but a group of eight-year-olds? Fifteen snot-nosed little brats who I can prove have the potential to be something more by blowing his fucking head off. And his slut of a...”

One of the boys gasped, and Ross quickly turned to shush him.

“Shh!” he giggled. “Mrs. Hanna’s been drinking crazy juice.”

Our teacher’s smile widened as she turned toward us, but it was a smile I no longer trusted.

“Yes, Ross,” she said. “I have been drinking crazy juice. But do you know what you are?” Her gaze flicked erratically across all of us.

“What?” Pippa asked.

“Special.”

“What do you mean by special?” Evie asked. “Because my mommy says I’m the only special one here.”

Mrs. Hanna didn’t answer directly. Instead, she spoke to all of us. “Who,” she let out a breathy laugh, “who wants to watch TV?”

I wasn’t sure what we were supposed to be watching. 

At first, I thought they were shapes we had to name. 

But then the shapes grew bigger until they filled the screen. I remember lurching back in my chair, though I couldn’t move. 

On screen, a picture of a man flashed up so fast I bit back a shriek. 

When I tried to move or tear my gaze away, I couldn’t. 

The room was pitch black except for the screen illuminating my face.

I couldn’t look away. I was aware my body was jerking, my breaths heavy. 

“This,” Mrs. Hanna said, her voice rattling inside my skull. 

I couldn’t stop myself. My mouth moved before I could think, repeating her words.

*“This.”*

I spat it out in unison with the others. Her words weren’t just sounds. 

They were physical, splitting my skull, bleeding straight into my brain.

“Is my husband.”

The words tore from my lips in a river of red.

*“Is.”*

*“My.”*

*“Husband.”*

“I LOVED him,” she continued. And so did we. 

*“I… LOVED… him.”*

Next to me, Ross spluttered blood across his desk, eyes darting back and forth, locked on the TV screen.

“He cheated on me with that sly, fucking wretch,” she said, tears streaking her face.

*“He cheated on you,”* We echoed. *“With that… sly, fucking wretch.”*

Her anguish became ours. Her sobs entangled us. Suffocating us. 

Tears ran down my cheeks. 

But they weren’t mine. Her heartbreak twisted in my chest, agonizing.

“And now,” Mrs. Hanna spat.

Blood shot from my nose. 

My body jerked violently.

*”And… n-now.”*

Her lips split into a grin. “He must fucking die.”

I opened my mouth, but my words were no longer mine.

There was something alive, crawling, inside my head.

And no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get it out. 

*”He.”* 

The word was like poison, rattling my body. 

*”Must.”*

My head drooped, my eyes forced open, blood coating my tongue.

*“Fucking.”*

The girl next to me wasn't moving, her left eye hanging out of its socket. 

But Ross sat still, smiling, unblinking, gaze fixated on the screen. 

Blood dripped from his lips, his chin, seeping across his desk. 

He smelled of burning, like charred chicken.

As a small business owner, you live and breathe the dance of risk and reward. You risk your capital, your time, and your energy for the reward of building something you believe in—a thriving business that serves its customers and supports your dreams. But what happens when a transaction goes sideways? What happens when a customer, for reasons legitimate or not, disputes a charge, triggering a chargeback?

Suddenly, you’re not just out the sale. You’re hit with a chargeback fee, your product is likely gone, and your payment processing history takes a hit. It feels personal, like a punch to the gut. For a small business, a string of these can be more than just frustrating; they can be financially devastating.

This is where the game of risk and reward sharpens to a fine point. The risk is in every transaction, but the reward comes from being prepared. The single most powerful tool in your arsenal isn't aggressive customer service or fancy software; it’s a set of clear, comprehensive, and consistently enforced policies. Think of them as your chargeback shield. A well-crafted payment policy, supported by other key business policies, is your front-line defense, your evidence, and your best chance at winning a dispute before it even begins.

This guide is designed for you—the coffee shop owner, the online boutique proprietor, the freelance graphic designer, the heart and soul of the small business world. We’re going to break down exactly how to build a chargeback shield with policies that not only protect your bottom line but also build customer trust and confidence.

# The Foundation: Your Crystal-Clear Return & Refund Policy

The most common source of chargebacks stems from confusion or dissatisfaction with a purchase. A customer feels they didn’t get what they paid for, the item was defective, or they simply changed their mind. Before they even think of calling their bank, your return and refund policy should be the first place they look.

If it’s hard to find, confusing, or overly restrictive, you’re practically inviting a dispute. The goal here is clarity and accessibility.

**Best Practices for Your Return & Refund Policy:**

* **Make It Easy to Find:** Don’t bury it. Your policy should be linked in your website footer, on product pages, in your order confirmation emails, and even on your checkout page. A customer should never have to hunt for it.
* **Use Plain English:** Avoid legal jargon. Write in a way that is easy for anyone to understand. Use headings, bullet points, and bold text to break up the information.
   * **Bad Example:** ""All sales are considered final unless the merchandise is found to be materially defective upon receipt, in which case a request for a return merchandise authorization (RMA) must be submitted within 72 hours.""
   * **Good Example:** ""Changed your mind? No problem! We accept returns within 30 days of purchase. Here’s how it works:""
* **Clearly Define the ""Who, What, When, How"":**
   * **What can be returned?** (e.g., all items, only unused items in original packaging, sale items are final).
   * **When can it be returned?** (e.g., 14 days, 30 days, 90 days from purchase date).
   * **How will they be refunded?** (e.g., original form of payment, store credit). Be explicit. If you only offer store credit for certain returns, state it clearly.
   * **Who pays for shipping?** (e.g., customer is responsible for return shipping, or you provide a prepaid label).
* **Set Expectations for Processing Time:** Let customers know how long it will take to process the return and issue the refund once you receive the item. ""Please allow 5-7 business days for us to process your return after it arrives at our workshop.""

**Pro Tip:** Require customers to check a box at checkout that says, ""I have read and agree to the Return & Refund Policy."" This creates a digital paper trail proving they were aware of your terms before completing the purchase—a powerful piece of evidence in a dispute.

# The Proof of Delivery: Your Shipping & Delivery Policy

""I never got it."" This is one of the most difficult chargeback claims to fight, especially for businesses shipping physical goods. Without proof of delivery, it becomes your word against the customer's. A robust shipping policy, combined with meticulous execution, is your best defense.

**Best Practices for Your Shipping & Delivery Policy:**

* **Provide Tracking for Everything:** This is non-negotiable. Even for small items, the cost of tracking is a small price to pay for the insurance it provides against ""item not received"" claims. Make sure the tracking number is automatically sent to the customer as soon as the order ships.
* **Require a Signature for High-Value Items:** If you’re selling expensive goods, signature confirmation is a must. It’s definitive proof that the item was received by a person at the specified address. Yes, it’s an extra cost, but it can save you thousands in a single dispute.
* **Clearly State Shipping Timelines:** On your product and checkout pages, provide realistic estimates for processing and shipping times. ""Orders are typically processed in 1-2 business days. Standard shipping takes an additional 3-5 business days."" Under-promise and over-deliver whenever possible.
* **Document Your Packaging Process:** For high-value or fragile items, consider taking a quick photo of the item packaged in the box with the shipping label visible before you seal it. This can be invaluable evidence if a customer claims they received an empty box or the wrong item.
* **Address and P.O. Box Verification:** Use address verification services (AVS) offered by your payment processor. This tool checks that the billing address entered by the customer matches the one on file with their credit card company. For shipping, be clear about whether you ship to P.O. boxes.

# The Rulebook: Your Terms of Service (TOS)

Your Terms of Service is the overarching contract between you and your customer. It sets the rules of engagement for everything from how they can use your website to the specifics of your payment policy. While many customers may not read it in full, its existence is crucial for winning disputes, especially those related to services or digital products.

**Key Elements for Your TOS:**

* **Detailed Service Descriptions:** For service-based businesses (consulting, design, coaching), your TOS should be incredibly detailed about what the service includes and, just as importantly, what it *doesn’t* include. Define the scope of work, the number of revisions, and the deliverables. This prevents ""service not as described"" chargebacks.
* **Billing and Payment Terms:** Reiterate your payment policy here. State when payment is due (e.g., upfront, 50% deposit, upon completion). If you offer subscriptions, the cancellation and refund policy for recurring billing must be crystal clear. You must state how a customer can cancel, the notice period required, and what happens to their access post-cancellation.
* **""Acceptance of Work"" Clause:** For project-based work, include a clause that defines how the client formally accepts the final product. This could be a final sign-off email or the act of using the delivered work. Once they’ve accepted it, it becomes much harder to claim the service wasn't rendered.
* **Communication Policy:** Outline your official channels and hours of communication. This can help manage expectations and prevent disputes arising from a customer feeling ignored over a weekend.

Just like with your return policy, require customers to agree to your TOS before they can complete a purchase or sign up for a service. This affirmative action is a cornerstone of your defense.

# The Evidence Locker: Meticulous Record-Keeping

When a chargeback is filed, the card issuer opens an investigation. They will ask you, the merchant, to provide compelling evidence that the charge was legitimate. Vague recollections or missing invoices won’t cut it. You need a well-organized evidence locker.

**Your Essential Documentation Checklist:**

* **Customer Communications:** Save every email, chat log, and social media message. If a customer emails you saying, ""I love the new branding you designed!"" and then files a chargeback a week later claiming the service wasn't as described, that email is your golden ticket.
* **Invoices and Receipts:** Ensure your receipts are detailed. They should include the customer's name, billing and shipping address, a description of the item or service, and the date of the transaction.
* **Proof of Delivery:** Keep tracking numbers and delivery confirmation receipts readily accessible.
* **Digital Footprints:** For online businesses, IP logs showing the customer's location at the time of purchase, combined with AVS and CVV (the three-digit code on the back of the card) confirmation, paint a strong picture of a legitimate transaction.
* **Signed Contracts/Agreements:** For any significant service or custom work, a signed contract is your best friend.

Organize these records by customer or transaction number so you can quickly pull everything together when the chargeback notification arrives. You typically have a limited time to respond, so being prepared is key.

# The Human Element: Training Your Team

Your policies are only as good as the people who enforce them. Your customer service team is on the front lines of chargeback prevention. A single well-handled customer interaction can de-escalate a potential dispute into a happy resolution.

**Training Essentials for Your Staff:**

* **Know the Policies Inside and Out:** Every employee who interacts with customers should be an expert on your return, shipping, and payment policies. They should be able to answer questions confidently and consistently.
* **Empathy and Active Listening:** Train your team to listen to a customer's complaint fully before responding. Often, customers just want to feel heard. An empathetic ear can turn a frustrated customer into a loyal one.
* **Focus on Resolution, Not Blame:** The goal should always be to find a solution. Instead of saying, ""You should have read the policy,"" try, ""I understand you're frustrated. While our policy is X, let's see what we can do to make this right. How about Y?""
* **Recognize Red Flags:** Train your team to spot potential signs of fraudulent transactions, such as a shipping address that doesn't match the billing address (especially for international orders), unusually large orders, or a flurry of rapid-fire purchases. Empower them to flag these orders for manual review before fulfillment.

# Conclusion: Turning Risk into Your Greatest Strength

Chargebacks are an unfortunate cost of doing business, but they don’t have to be a constant drain on your resources and morale. By shifting your mindset from reactive defense to proactive protection, you can build a formidable chargeback shield around your small business.

Your policies are more than just fine print; they are the framework for a clear, honest, and trustworthy relationship with your customers. A well-defined payment policy, supported by transparent rules for returns, shipping, and services, sets clear expectations for everyone involved. It reduces confusion, minimizes frustration, and builds the kind of customer confidence that leads to repeat business, not disputes.

The risk of a chargeback is real, but the reward for being prepared is immense. It’s the reward of financial stability, of peace of mind, and of the confidence that comes from knowing you’ve built your business on a solid, defensible foundation. Now go fortify your shield.

1mta8yn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Straycats/comments/1mta8yn/should_my_roomate_let_her_feral_cat_back_outside/,Should my roomate let her feral cat back outside?,"Hi all — I’ve been living with my roommate for about 3 months. We met in class and decided to live together mainly to save on rent during our summer internships, and we plan to stay roommates through the fall semester. She’s a good roommate overall — except for her cat Squeegee.

Before we moved in, she asked if she could bring her cat. I initially said no because I’m allergic, but she insisted he was hypoallergenic and excited to meet me, so I didn’t push back (my mistake).

The cat has been an issue since day one: he immediately peed everywhere and scratched the coffee table, so she started keeping him in her bedroom. The problem now is that he howls all night. When she’s not home, he screams constantly, which makes it hard when I’m on calls. He also randomly hisses and lunges at me even though I avoid him — he was feral and my roommate insists on keeping him indoors even though he clearly wants to go outside.

She loves him but I feel like she does what *she* wants with him (puts boots on him, cuddles him even when he scratches her) rather than what’s actually good for him. Honestly, I think he’d be happier as a barn/outdoor cat — he’s still basically feral, plus he’s overweight because she overfeeds him.

At this point he’s peeing around the apartment even during the day. She cleans it up but it still smells like pee and litter all the time. I don’t blame the cat, but it’s really affecting my quality of life. I don’t want to overstep or make her send him away, but I’m also stuck living with this demon cat until December and I don’t know what else to do. (We renting in for the summer-fall semester and housing is pain so neither of us really want to move out, plus she's a good roommate apart from Squeegee) 

Any advice on how to deal with this without crossing a line would be appreciated. Also — is it actually ethical to keep a  feral cat inside like this? Or am I overthinking it? She is constantly with the cat when she's home, and sets up treat mazes and tries to play with him but he lunges and scratches, she says he's just playing but in my opinion he's telling her to LEAVE HIM ALONE AND LET HIM OUTSIDE. I've brought up putting and AirTag on him and letting him roam like he used to and she said he would likely die within the week (we live by no major road, biggest wildlife is a raccoon) I get having a cat that was born indoors and keeping it that way because it's safer, but this is a feral cat who I think might be miserable. Any answers are helpful and since this not my pet I can't rehome or else I'd have Squeegee living it up in a barn or something, im honesty clueless about cats (I've only had dogs and rodents) and just want to help him for both our sakes lol.t 

(For clarity: I would *never* physically discipline him — I just use a firm voice or try to redirect. He has multiple litter boxes, cat trees, toys, and my roommate does “enrichment” stuff with him. Vet confirmed nothing is medically wrong and the peeing is behavioral.)",5,1755485182.0,Straycats,4,1.0,False

Watch Me Win, Alpha

Everyone thought I was the perfect Luna.
Even Ethan believed I'd never fight back.
So when he brought another woman into our territory, I smiled.
I handed him a folder and watched him sign his name without reading it.
He didn't know he was signing our divorce.
He didn't know his Luna made a deal with his mother, secretly moving out of his life.
Let him keep the mistress.
I'll take back my freedom.
And wait to see his face when he knows the truth.
Chapter 1
Olivia’s POV
May 8, 2023, my Alpha Mate, Ethan Hawthorne brought his mistress to our pack, and I decided to deceive him into divoring me.
Standing in front of his office, I took a deep breath, knocked on and stepped inside.
The polished wood door swung closed behind me with a soft click.
I clutched the file in my hands , forcing a mechanical smile to my lips as I approached his desk. Ethan didn’t glance up. His focus remained on the laptop screen.
“Are you busy?” I asked, my voice even, polite.
He looked up, his gray eyes meeting mine without any flicker of warmth.
“A bit,” he said, voice low and rough. He leaned back in his chair. I placed the folder on his desk, already flipping to the marked pages where his signature was needed.
“Just a few spots to sign.”
Without reading, he picked up the pen lying next to his laptop and began to sign, page after page, his hand moving automatically, his gaze occasionally drifting back to his screen.
I watched silently. Ethan looked…worn out. His usually sharp grey eyes were dull, and there were deep shadows under them. He had just come back from London after two weeks at the Annual Alpha Conference — a gathering of pack leaders across the globe.
But he hadn’t come back alone.
My wolf Yve stirred uneasily inside me.‘He reeks of her.’I pushed her down gently. There was no point in flaring up.Not when the papers he had just signed held the ending we both needed.
When he was finished, he clicked the pen closed and slid it across the table toward me.
“Thanks,” I said, sliding the documents back into my folder.
I paused, hesitated, then asked, “Will you be home for dinner tonight?”
Predictably, Ethan shook his head. “Got some things to wrap up here. Don’t wait.”
I nodded, plastering the same empty smile across my face. “Got it. See you around, Alpha,” I said, forcing my voice to sound like any other obedient wolf under his rule—not like the Luna and fated mate he seemed to have regretted claiming.”
I turned away, letting my smile fade once my back was to him.
My heels clicked softly against the hardwood floor as I walked toward the door.The air shifted slightly when I passed the annex lounge, and Yve immediately bristled.
‘Smell.’Sweet vanilla perfume — too sweet.I glanced sideways without thinking, my enhanced senses sharpening the image beyond what human eyes would see.
Half a box of artisanal pastries sat abandoned on the low glass table. A lipstick-smeared coffee cup beside it. And near the plush lounge chair, a black high-heeled shoe.
Yve snarled deep within me, the sound more a vibration across my bones than a true noise.‘He brought her here. Here. Not just to London. To our den. Our Pack. He stains our space.’
My throat tightened painfully.
My chest felt heavy, like something was sitting right on top of it as I turned on my heel and head back, away from this awful place that made me feel disgusted.
By the time I got back to my office, exhaustion hit me hard. I dropped into my chair, not even bothering to turn on the lights.
Slowly, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the lowest drawer—the very document Ethan had just unknowingly signed.
My fingers brushed over his perfect signature.
Firm. Bold. Unwavering.
Just like the way he had pledged himself to me during the mating ceremony years ago. Back then, Ethan had been so firm, so sure. He looked at me like I was his whole world. I had believed it, like a fool.
That familiar scent I sniffed earlier—I knew exactly who it belonged to. I’m smarter than this. I should’ve seen it coming.
I could still feel the phantom brush of his lips against the mark he placed on my neck.
I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. I could almost hear Ethan’s mother Amelia’s voice again— calm, cold, and cutting. “Don’t be naive, Olivia. Men—even Alphas—always want more. They don’t stay faithful.”
A bitter laugh escaped my lips. “You were always spot on, Amelia,” I muttered.
I realized then that I had been wrong. So, so wrong.
Not only had Ethan cheated, but he had taken his mistress to our office.
‘We deserve better’, Yve whispered.
‘We do’, I agreed.
Steeling myself, I picked up my phone, snapped a clear photo of the signed divorce agreement, and attached it to a new message.
To: Amelia HawthroneSubject: Agreement CompleteMessage: Ethan has signed, as per our understanding.
I hit send without hesitation.
The previous week, Amelia had approached me in private.If I agreed to file for divorce quietly, without confronting Ethan or exposing the affair publicly, she would ensure a settlement of $150 million transferred discreetly to my personal accounts.
In the world of packs and politics, image was everything. An Alpha embroiled in a public scandal would weaken the Hawthrone Pack’s standing — something Amelia would never allow.
Neither would I, truthfully. No matter how broken Ethan had left me, I would not humiliate myself by causing a spectacle.
I had my dignity.
After a month — the grace period to finalize everything — Ethan would be free.And so would I.
I let out a slow breath, settling into my chair. That’s when a knock came at the door.
“Come in,” I said.
Ethan’s beta, Reed stepped inside, carrying a small, elegant box in both hands.
“Luna Olivia,” he said formally, not quite meeting my eyes. “Alpha Ethan asked me to deliver this to you. He bought it for you during his trip to London.”
Reed placed the box on my desk and I flipped the lid open.
Inside, nestled on deep blue velvet, was a gleaming diamond set — necklace, earrings, bracelet. The same set I had seen in a photo...on her.
Disgust crawled up my throat.
“Alpha Ethan mentioned he... he picked it out personally. Wanted something special for you.” Reed added quickly, like the words might make it hurt less.
I forced a smile, tucking the box back into my desk drawer like it meant nothing.
“How thoughtful of him,” I said. “Even with his busy schedule and all” I said lightly, my tone dripping with sarcasm.
Reed flinched slightly. “I should get back,” He was slipping out, leaving the door swinging shut behind him with a soft thud.
My eyes dropped back to the jewelry sitting on my desk, gleaming under the harsh office lights.My stomach twisted in disgust.
Without wasting another second, I snapped a photo of it and forwarded it to a second-hand luxury dealer.Me: Donate the full amount to the werewolf orphanage fund.
I shut the box with a click, wiping my hands like I’d just handled garbage. Because, honestly, that’s what it felt like.
By five in the evening, I was wrapping up, gathering my things, and heading to the parking lot.The day had drained me, but it was the kind of exhaustion that sat deeper than muscles or bones.
As I stepped outside, the wind shifted, carrying a familiar scent.Leather. Musk. Vanilla.
My eyes narrowed instinctively.
That’s when I spotted Ethan’s car, parked near the exit.
Through the window, I caught a glimpse—Ethan, sitting in the back seat.
And right beside him, a vibrant blonde, laughing like she didn’t have a care in the world.
Reed was behind the wheel.
The second he saw me, he slammed on the brakes, hard enough that the car jolted.
For a heartbeat, everything went still.
My eyes locked with Ethan’s through the glass.
Chapter 2
Olivia’s POV
I recognized the blonde girl sitting close to Ethan — it was Chole Windsor, the daughter of the Alpha of the second-largest pack in the United States.
She didn’t even pretend to be subtle. Her eyes found mine across the lot, but she made no move to step away from Ethan. Instead, she draped her arms over his shoulders, leaned in, and whispered something in his ear. He didn’t stop her.
I looked away. Got into my car, turned the engine, and drove off without sparing them a second glance.
I hadn’t been home for long. After slipping off my shoes at the entrance, I made my way upstairs to the walk-in closet, the quiet of the pack house settling around me.
I was standing in front of the wardrobe, picking out a necklace — something simple to go with tomorrow’s blazer — when I heard a car pull into the gravel driveway outside.
I didn’t need to look to know who it was.
A moment later, I smelled someone behind me.Ethan.
I didn’t turn around. Just clasped the necklace and set it back in its place.
“Are you upset?” he asked.
“Obviously,” I said, still not looking at him. “You should be careful next time.”
He didn’t respond right away. I heard him exhale through his nose. “The Windsor pack’s Alpha wants to collaborate with us. I’ve been talking to Felix, their eldest Alpha-in-line. Chole is his sister.”
I nodded slightly and turned to face him. “So to secure the alliance, it’s necessary to wrap your arms around his sister in public?”
His jaw flexed. He didn’t answer immediately. For a moment, he just looked at me like he didn’t expect to be questioned. Then his voice hardened.
“I'm trying to explain, Olivia. Watch your tone when speaking to your Alpha.”
I stared at him for a second.
“You don’t need to explain anything to me,” I said. “If you’re tired of me and ready to name someone else as Luna, say so. I’ll leave.”
His face darkened. “What did you just say?”
I didn’t flinch. “I said we can get a divorce and break the bond.”
I stepped past him, but he grabbed my arm. His hand shot up to my chin, gripping it just enough to hold me still without bruising.
“Don’t ever say that again,” he said, voice low.
I didn’t respond. Just met his eyes for a beat too long before pulling away.
But inside, I already knew — I wasn’t saying it for effect.
I’d been thinking about divorce for weeks. Preparing for it in quiet ways. I didn’t want him anymore.
Ethan stayed home that night. Sat in the Alpha’s private office most of the evening, didn’t eat dinner. It was well past midnight when he finally got a phone call that made him leave. I wasn’t close enough to hear everything, but I caught a woman’s voice on the other end — crying.
The next morning, my phone lit up with a message from my friend Ava — a lawyer. She had sent me a screenshot of Chole’s latest post.
It was a photo taken at sunrise, from the top of some mountain trail. Two hands clasped together, fingers interlocked.The caption read: “Enjoy the sunrise, feel your heartbeat.”
I stared at the photo.
One of those hands was Ethan’s. I’d know that scar near his thumb anywhere.
I sat holding my mug for so long the water went cold. Only when I set it down did it make a sound.
The following days, Ethan didn’t return home.
At work, we saw each other only during meetings. He sat at the head of the table, and I stayed on the side with the executives. We barely made eye contact. I didn’t go upstairs to his office, and he didn’t come down to mine.
In the evenings, I started browsing house listings — somewhere small, outside the city. I also started clearing out the closet. Anniversary gifts. Jewelry. Even the wedding ring. All of it went to resell platforms or donation. They didn’t mean anything to me anymore.
One evening around 11 p.m., Luna Kate from SilverFang pack texted me out of the blue, inviting me to join her at a club. We were not very familiar—I'd only met her a few times when I attended the Pack Summit with Ethan. She was very good at greeting anyone with her fake smile. Her Alpha husband was frequently caught up in scandals, and now she started to be a social butterfly as well.
I almost said no. But then I remembered — if I really left the Hawthorne Group, I’d have to build something on my own. Might as well start moving.
“Sure,” I texted back.
When I got to the Moonfell, Kate met me near the entrance. She linked her arm through mine like we were best friends.
“Glad to see you Olivia,” she kissed my face. No one but our inner circle knew Ethan and I were married. They always called me Olivia and thought we were just a rumored couple with mate bond.
“Me too,” I tried to fake smile.
She led me upstairs and into a large room that was divided by a decorative wooden screen.
There were people on the other side — laughing, drinking, talking loud — but Kate brought me to this side, quieter, with just one woman sitting alone. I recognized her vaguely. Mate of someone in Ethan’s circle. She smiled at me — tight, awkward.
I took off my coat, sat down, and Kate disappeared a moment later.
I picked up a drink, sipped it once, and then I heard it.
My name.
From the other side of the screen.
“She hasn’t been seen with Alpha Ethan much lately, huh?”
“Well, of course not. He takes Chole Windsor everywhere now.”
“She’s the daughter of the second biggest Pack Alpha in the country. Obviously, she’s a better fit. Makes the Pack look stronger.”
“Still, Olivia and Alpha Ethan were together what — eight years? He’s probably tired of her even though they are mates.”
There was a pause. Then a chuckle.“Shame. She wasted her best years. I’d still take a go at her, though.”
The cup froze in my hand.
I recognized the voices. Two of them belonged to the sons of the Gamma and Delta.
The woman beside me shifted uncomfortably.
I stood up. She looked startled, maybe thinking I was going to leave.
Instead, I cleared my throat, picked up my drink, and stepped around the screen.
The laughter faded when they saw me.
I leaned casually against the edge of the divider, my drink in hand. I looked at the one who’d spoken last.
“Isn’t it a bit unfair?” I asked. “You make it sound like I’ve been living off him.”
They blinked.
I took a sip.
“Ethan was a virgin before we got together. So if I’ve been using him to satisfy my needs for eight years without paying — sounds like I got the better deal, doesn’t it?
Silence. The whole room had gone still.
Most of them just stared— and then widened when they looked at someone behind me.
Chapter 3
Olivia’s POV
I smelled it. I turned around, and there he was.
Alpha Ethan.
I glanced at him, then looked past him to the low velvet sofa behind. Chole Windsor sat there, legs crossed, glass in hand.
Her smile was gone. The way she stared at me —her eyes flashing with the territorial aggression of a she-wolf ready to defend her claim — made it clear she would've ripped my throat out if she could get away with it.
That’s when it clicked.
This wasn’t some coincidence. They were here together. Chole, Ethan, and their usual circle — people I once thought of as allies. This was their private little gathering. From the way they talked earlier, it clearly wasn’t their first. They didn’t even care to hide their relationship. Maybe they never had.
Ethan walked toward me.
Behind him, the group scrambled back to life. One of them stepped forward quickly. “Olivia, we were just messing around—none of it was serious. We were just talking nonsense.”
Another added, “Really sorry. We didn’t mean anything by it.”
I didn’t respond.
Ethan reached for my wrist.
“Let’s go,” he said, already trying to pull me out of the room.
I didn’t fight.
Instead, I grabbed my drink and threw it in his face, a clear challenge in the presence of his pack.
The room fell into complete silence again. Someone gasped. I could hear the ice clink against his cheek as the liquid ran down his jawline.
I smiled faintly, “Please, Alpha, continue enjoying yourself with your beloved. I won’t interrupt again.”
Then I lowered my head, tried to pull my hand back from his.
His grip only tightened.
His face had gone dark. Without another word, he bent down, grabbed me, and threw me over his shoulder like a sack.
I kicked instinctively. “Ethan—put me down!”
He didn’t respond.
We walked into the hallway, and I struggled on his back, but Ethan didn’t loosen his grip.The elevator had just arrived on the floor. As he stepped inside and turned around, my upside-down view caught a pair of polished black leather shoes. Then black suit pants, long legs, and pale hands — each finger slender, the joints sharp and defined.
The air felt still. Quiet but awkward.
Ethan walked out of the elevator just as I looked up — and met a pair of deep, steady eyes.
Sharp and captivating.
They held mine for a second too long. I looked away, suddenly embarrassed to be seen like that. Slung over Ethan’s shoulder like some helpless object.
Suddenly, Yve stirred inside me, her instincts sharpening, the primal awareness of another strong wolf nearby sparking her curiosity.
I didn’t know why I felt that way. But I didn’t like it. It unsettled me.
Ethan dragged me out of the club and down the steps to his car. He opened the back door, tossed me in, and climbed in himself.
My head spun. Being carried upside down and then thrown like that.
He grabbed a wet wipe from the glove compartment and began wiping his face silently.
Then he finally spoke. “Why were you there? You came to catch me, didn’t you?”
As he wiped his cheek, I noticed something just behind the tissue box.
A foil wrapper — gold, neatly tucked behind the tissue box.
A condom.
The sight of it made my stomach turn. I looked away immediately and reached for the door handle.
“I’m not staying in this car,” I said.
He pulled me back roughly. “Where do you think you’re going?”
“Home,” I said, my breathing uneven. “I want to go home.”
“Stop making trouble, Olivia. My patience is running out.”
I didn’t answer. Just sat there, breathing hard.
“Harold!” Ethan called out toward the club. “Drive.”
Harold came out a minute later, nodded, and got into the front seat.
The ride was silent. I stayed pressed against the farthest side of the car, arms crossed, staring out the window.
By the time we reached the house, I opened the door and got out before the engine had fully stopped.
Inside, I went straight to the kitchen and poured a full glass of ice water. I drank all of it in one go.
Only then did I feel something close to normal.
When I walked back out, Ethan was sitting in the living room. I didn’t ask why.
I sat down across from him.
It was quiet for a while. Then he said, “I was there to talk business. A new project.”
I said nothing.
“You showing up and making a scene like that — it embarrassed me.”
He kept going. “You looked ridiculous. Screaming, throwing drinks. Like a jealous shrew.”
I stared at him.
He looked back at me, like he expected me to deny it.
“Is that all?” I asked.
His brows drew together. “If you want our relationship to work, you need to stop being paranoid all the time. I don’t have time for your insane suspicions.”
I nodded. “Got it. Anything else?”
He stared at me. “Do you know how annoying you are right now?”
I stood up slowly.
He won’t be annoyed much longer.
I went upstairs, changed into pajamas, and got into bed without another word.
He came up about an hour later and found me already asleep.
After showering, he got into bed quietly. I turned my back to him and inched closer to the edge, making sure our bodies wouldn’t touch.
That didn’t stop him.
He hugged me from behind and yanked me back into his arms, rough and without a word. He was tall, his Alpha strength undeniable, the raw power of a pack leader. With barely any effort, he held me in place, his grip unyielding, making it clear that resisting would be pointless.
I spent the night stiffly, barely moving.
By morning, I hadn’t slept at all. I went downstairs and made breakfast for myself — toast, boiled eggs, a glass of milk. I sat alone at the dining table and started eating in silence.
Ethan came down a little while later, dressed for work. He glanced toward me but didn’t say anything at first. He walked halfway to the door, then stopped. A few seconds passed before he turned around and walked over.
He leaned in close to my ear.
“This weekend,” he said gently, “let’s go out to sea. Just the two of us. Clear our heads a little.”
I took a sip of milk and replied without looking at him. “Hmm.”
That was it.
On Friday, he broke the promise.Said he had to fly to Washington for a project. An urgent meeting, supposedly.
I wasn’t surprised. I didn’t feel anything — no disappointment, no anger. Just nothing.
Maybe he hasn’t noticed we haven’t shared a meal in weeks. We don’t talk. We don’t go anywhere. We don’t spend time like people in a marriage — not even like people who live under the same roof.
He says divorce is out of the question, but I already feel like someone who doesn’t exist to him.
If I disappeared tomorrow, I genuinely doubt he would even notice.
Over the weekend, I started moving books out of the study. Stacked them into a suitcase and took them to my new apartment. The place was smaller. Simpler. But it felt like mine.
While I was organizing the shelf, my phone rang.
Melina.
I hesitated, then picked up. “Hello, Luna Melina.” Ever since I married his son eight years ago, she still asks me to call her luna.
She snorted arrogantly. “Come over now. We need to put down in writing what we discussed earlier.”
I paused. “Is that really necessary?”
She didn’t hesitate. “If I say so.”
""Fine. I'll go back this afternoon,"" I answered.
Yet, she wasn't satisfied. ""Come back at noon.""
Chapter 4
Olivia’s POV
I arrived atHawthorne Manoraround 11 AM.
As I approached the main entrance, a sweet, overly cheerful voice drifted out through the partially open windows.
“Yay! I won again!” The girl’s tone was playful, but there was a flirtatious edge to it, the kind meant to tease a lover. “Are you letting me win on purpose, Ethan?”
I paused, my hand hovering over the door handle. I didn’t need to see her to know who it was.
Chole Windsor.
I realized the real purpose of Melina, she wanted to humiliated me.
I took a slow breath, letting Yve’s quiet growl settle in my chest, then pushed open the door and stepped inside.
Ethan was in the living room, his head turning sharply when he caught sight of me. For a moment, his eyes flickered with surprise, quickly masked by a flash of annoyance. “What are you doing here?”
I walked in, slipping my sunglasses off and tucking them into the pocket of my loose white T-shirt. I hadn’t bothered with makeup today, just jeans and a comfortable shirt. I met his eyes,“Your mom didn’t tel you? She called me.” I continued, “Didn’t know you were back from London so soon. Or are you a magician now, managing to be in two places at once?”
His jaw tightened, a flicker of guilt flashing in his eyes. He didn’t respond.
Before he could recover, Chole stood up from the plush velvet sofa. She brushed an invisible speck of dust off her thigh, showing off her perfectly manicured fingers.
“Hi,” she extened her hand, stepping closer with a bright smile. “I’m Chole Windsor. It’s nice to meet you.”
I looked at her outstretched hand for a second, then deliberately ignored her.
Melina entered the room. She wore a tailored black dress, her hair swept back in a flawless chignon, a perfect image of power and control. Her eyes moved over me briefly before settling on Chole.
“Chole, darling,” she said, taking Chole’s hand in both of hers,“I hope you’re having a good time today. Make yourself at home. This is your house too.”
I felt a muscle in my jaw tighten, but I kept my face neutral.
Melina’s eyes flicked to me, her expression cooling instantly.“Ah, Olivia. You’re here.”
She turned back to Chole, her tone still warm.“This is Ms. Hawthorne, the manager of the Hawthorne Group. She’s here on business.”
It took every ounce of self-control not to roll my eyes. She made it sound like I was just another employee, someone here to deliver a report, not the Luna of the pack or her son’s wife. It was a subtle dismissal, a deliberate way to tell Chole that I was no threat.
I ignored her, my eyes drifting back to Ethan. He didn’t even try to defend my position.
“Didn’t you say we had business to discuss? Let’s get it over with.”
Melina’s smile tightened slightly.“We can discuss it another day. You’re here now, so why not join us for a meal?”
I exhaled slowly, already tired of this charade.“I’m not here for a meal, Melina. I have other things to do.”I turned to leave, my back already to them.
Her voice sharpened,“I am still the pack luna, Olivia, and I have asked you politely to stay. What is this attitude of yours? No manners at all.”
I paused, my hand stilling on the back of a leather chair. I turned slowly, meeting her icy stare with one of my own.“Fine. I’ll stay for a meal.”I met her gaze without blinking.“Just make sure you don’t regret it.”
Chole, sensing the tension, quickly tried to lighten the atmosphere,“Oh, that’s perfect. I was just telling Ethan how much I enjoyed winning our little game of Silver Moon Toss earlier. I’d love to keep playing.”
I glanced at the balcony where a polishedSilver Moon Tosstarget stood, several delicate gold rings stacked neatly beside it. I hadn’t even noticed it before. Clearly, it was something new — probably Chole’s idea.
Silver Moon Tosswas a light social competition often played atwerewolf gatherings. The rules were simple — players took turns tossing three golden rings, trying to encircle the movingMoon Pillarfive meters away. It required precision and rhythm, often used to showcase coordination between couples.
Chole’s eyes lit up when she saw me looking at the ring toss setup.“Oh, Olivia, do you know how to playSilver Moon Toss?”
I met her gaze, catching the hint of challenge behind her bright smile.“Only a little,”I replied, letting my eyes linger on her for a beat.“Wanna play?”
Ethan’s jaw tightening as he shot me a warning look.
“Of course. Shall I go first, or would you like the honor?” Chole adjusted one of the gold rings on the table, her confidence flaring.
“Go ahead. I’ll watch.” I stepped back, casually folding my arms.
Chole’s smile widened, clearly pleased with herself. She stepped into position, her posture perfect, each movement precise. She took a steadying breath, then flicked her wrist. The golden ring sliced through the air, narrowly missing the Moon Pillar, landing just a few centimeters off.
She turned back to me,“Almost nailed it.”
Behind her, Melina’s eyes followed the ring,“Chole. So graceful.”
Chole gave a appreciative nod, clearly loving the praise.
I didn’t bother with any of the theatrics. I stepped forward, picked up a ring, and tossed it without much thought. The ring cut through the air cleanly, glinting in the sunlight before slipping perfectly around the Moon Pillar with a clear, satisfying clink.
Chole’s smile froze for a second, her fingers tightening around the ring she still held. She forced a thin, strained smile.“Lucky shot.”
I let a careless smile spread across my lips, leaning back slightly.“Maybe.”I shrugged,“Last time I played this was at the Alpha Foundation dinner with Ethan.”
The remark hit its mark. Chole’s face tensed, her grip on the ring tightening as she prepared for the next throw.
Melina stepped in quickly,“Dear, it’s just a game. The important thing is to have fun.”
I shrugged, stepping back.“Of course. But some people get carried away too easily.”
I didn’t miss the way Melina’s eyes flicked to Ethan, a silent accusation in them.
In the next few rounds, I almost hit every ring, each one sliding smoothly around theMoon Pillarwith a clear, satisfying clink. Meanwhile, Chole’s throws grew increasingly off-target, her rings clattering against the base or falling short entirely.
I noticed the slight tremble in her fingers as she reached for another ring, her forced smile tightening with every miss, her eyes flashing with barely concealed frustration.
Melina’s expression grew more strained with each missed attempt, her jaw clenching tighter every time I hit my mark. She glanced at Ethan, as if hoping for some intervention, but he remained silent.
I stepped back, dusted my hands lightly, then walked to the nearby sofa. I set my final ring down on the polished side table, folding my hands neatly in my lap, my eyes meeting theirs without flinching.
“Want to keep playing?”I asked, my tone light, almost bored.
Chole’s hand curled tightly around the last ring, her knuckles turning pale, lips pressed into a thin, strained line.
Melina shot me a sharp, furious look, her eyes narrowing into thin, dangerous slits.
Chapter 5
Olivia’s POV
“Come on, one more,”Chole said, trying to hide the frustration in her eyes.“I’m just getting warmed up.”
I glanced at her, then at Ethan, who still hadn’t said a word. Melina watched from the side, clearly annoyed but not stepping in.
“Sure,”I replied, picking up another ring, my tone casual.“Let’s keep going.”
We kept playing. I hit the pillar again. And again. Chole’s throws grew wilder, her aim less precise, her confidence visibly cracking. Melina’s eyes darted between us, her polished exterior slipping as her face twisted into an increasingly sour expression. She glanced at Ethan, clearly expecting him to intervene, but he just stood there.
I picked up my final ring, tossed it with a casual flick of my wrist, and it spun neatly around theMoon Pillaronce more.
Chole’s forced smile finally shattered. Her eyes filled with tears, and a small, broken sound escaped her throat. She clutched the last ring tightly, her fingers shaking, then let it clatter to the ground as she stumbled toward Ethan.
Ethan stepped forward, his face hard, eyes cold. He snatched the gold ring from my hand, his jaw clenched.
“That’s enough,” he said, his voice low but sharp.
Chole threw herself into his arms, her shoulders shaking as she buried her face in his chest. Ethan’s expression softened, his arm coming up to hold her gently, fingers stroking her back in slow, comforting circles. Melina quickly stepped in, wrapping an arm around Chole, whispering something I couldn’t hear.
“Really, Olivia?”Melina’s eyes snapped to me, sharp and furious.“It’s just a game. Was it necessary to take it so seriously?”
I didn’t respond, just slowly stepped back, setting my last ring down on the side table.
Melina’s eyes bored into me,“You come from an ordinary family. You think being competitive is the only way to gain respect?”
Her words hit like a slap.
I glanced at Ethan, expecting... what? Defense? Support? But his eyes were distant, his face like a faded photograph, all the vibrance I once admired now washed out and cold.
Forget it. There are only twenty days left. I shouldn’t care.
I stood up, ready to leave, my pulse still racing.
“Stop, you are hurting us,” Yve’s voice echoed in my mind.
I glanced down at my hand, my fingers curled so tightly that my nails had broken the skin. I hadn’t even noticed.
Then, I turned on my heel and walked toward the door.
“Olivia—”Ethan’s voice followed me, sharp and angry.
I didn’t stop.
I pushed through the grand double doors of theHawthorne Manor and got into my car, my chest heaving as I gripped the steering wheel.
My phone buzzed beside me. Ethan. I ignored it and finally, I blocked his number.
My hands still shook as I pulled out onto the road, the tires crunching against the gravel as I sped away from the mansion.
I reached for my phone, typing out a message to Melina with one hand.
“$250 million. Not a penny less. Or I’ll make sure you and your family pay the price.”
I hit send without hesitation, tossing the phone onto the passenger seat, my pulse still racing.
The sky had grown darker, thick gray clouds rolling in, the first few drops of rain splattering against my windshield.
Suddenly, a flash of yellow blurred past my peripheral vision, followed by the sharp, whining roar of a motorcycle engine.
A red bike cut in front of my car, swerving wildly, its rider dressed in dark leather, helmet glinting with water droplets.
I slammed on the brakes, my body jolting forward, the seatbelt cutting into my shoulder as my tires screeched against the wet asphalt.
“Careful!”Yve’s voice snapped in my head.
Before I could fully process what happened, a deafening crash shook my car. My head slammed into the steering wheel, a sharp, hot pain exploding behind my eyes.
I groaned, blinking rapidly as my vision blurred, red and dark, the world spinning slightly.
Immediately, I grabbed a tissue from the console, pressing it against my temple, wiping away the blood that blurred my vision.
Through the cracked windshield, I saw the red motorcycle disappearing into the distance. Then I checked my rear view mirror to find a black Maybach that had rear-ended me. Its front bumper was dented, the polished surface marred by the impact.
Before I could gather my thoughts, a firm knock sounded against my window.
A man in his forties, dressed in a crisp black suit, glasses perched on his nose, stood beside my car, a black umbrella in one hand, his expression polite but concerned.
I rolled down the window, wincing as the motion sent another wave of pain through my skull.
“I’m terribly sorry, ma’am,”he said, his voice calm and steady.“I rear-ended your car. I’ll take full responsibility.”
I caught the faint scent of another wolf on him — not a threat, but unfamiliar.
“My boss has some urgent matters to attend to,”he continued, nodding toward the back seat. I caught a glimpse of a tall, broad-shouldered figure in a dark suit, sunglasses hiding his eyes, his posture relaxed but radiating a quiet, dangerous energy.
“I’m Mike,” the man added, adjusting his glasses. “Can we exchange numbers? I’ll make sure all your expenses are covered.”
I took a deep breath, still feeling the sting at my temple. “I’d prefer to leave this to the police,” I replied, trying to keep my voice steady. “I’ve had enough surprises for one day.”
I pushed open the car door and stepped out, my shoes splashing in the shallow puddles forming on the wet road. I walked to the back of my car, my heart sinking when I saw the dent. The rear bumper was crumpled, the paint scraped off, and the tail light cracked. I frowned, took a quick photo for the insurance, then pulled out my phone and called the police.
A few minutes later, I heard another car door open. I glanced back, and the man in the back seat of the Maybach stepped out. Mike quickly moved to his side, holding a black umbrella over him, his posture respectful and hurried.
The man straightened, his suit perfectly tailored, sharp creases running down his pant legs, his shoes polished enough to reflect the gray sky. His presence was striking — tall, broad-shouldered, and the kind of face that commanded attention even in a crowd.
He took off his sunglasses, revealing deep-set eyes that met mine for a brief second. I felt my heart skip a beat. Something about him seemed... special, though I couldn’t place it.
I turned to the approaching officer, quickly explaining what had happened.
When I turned back, Mike was standing beside me, holding out a dark suit jacket. “Ma’am, your shirt is soaked,” he said politely, eyes slightly averted. “Please, put this on.”
I glanced down and felt my face heat up. My white shirt was clinging to my body, rainwater making the thin fabric almost transparent. I nodded and took the jacket from his hands, slipping it on quickly.
It was warm, the lining still carrying the faint heat of the man who had just worn it, along with a subtle, expensive cologne — something woody, clean, with a hint of smoke. It made my pulse quicken, and Yve stirred within me, her curiosity flaring.
“Thank you,” I mumbled, feeling awkward. “I’ll wash it and return it to your boss.”
Mike gave a small smile, shaking his head. “No need. My boss won’t mind.”
I looked up, but the man was already getting back into the Maybach. The door shut with a soft, expensive thud, and the car eased back onto the road, the engine barely making a sound as it disappeared into the rain.
I stood there for a moment, clutching the warm jacket around my shoulders, the lingering scent still teasing my senses, making Yve restless.
Chapter 6
Olivia’s POV
I sat on the edge of the padded examination table with the faint smell of antiseptic clinging to the air. Healer Rosa gently tilted my chin up, examining the cut on my forehead.
“Your temple region took the most damage,” she said, wiping the area with a damp cloth. “What happened?”
I hesitated, not wanting to get into the messy details of the accident. “It’s nothing. Just some reckless driver and bad luck. Yve has already handled most of it. I just came to make sure it heals without a scar.”
Rosa reached for a small jar on the counter, scooping a bit of herbal salve onto her fingers. “Hold still.”
I closed my eyes, letting the coolness of the cream soothing the faint sting.
The door burst open suddenly, crashing against the wall. Rosa flinched, her hands freezing mid-air.
Ethan stormed in. He took a few quick steps toward us.
Rosa’s eyes darted between us, her nervous fingers tightening around the jar. I offered her a reassuring nod. “It’s fine. That’s my... boss.”
Ethan centered his focus entirely on me. “Is it serious?” he demanded.
Rosa straightened, adjusting her glasses. “It’s just a superficial wound. Nothing too serious. She’ll be fine.”
He let out a breath. Rosa gave me theointment, then hurried out of the room.
Ethan stepped aside, but the moment I reached the doorway, he grabbed the small bottle of ointment from my hand. I paused, raising an eyebrow at him.
“I’ll handle this,” he muttered, tucking the bottle into his coat pocket as if it were some grand gesture of care.
I didn’t bother stopping him. If he wanted to play the part of the attentive husband, I wasn’t going to waste my breath arguing.
I pulled out my phone, intending to call a cab, but Ethan snatched the phone from my hand, his grip firm.
“Let’s go,” he said, already steering me toward the hospital exit.
“Hey—” I tried to pull my arm back, but his grip tightened.

We met in class and decided to live together mainly to save on rent during our summer internships, and we plan to stay roommates through the fall semester. She’s a good roommate overall — except for her cat Squeegee.

Before we moved in, she asked if she could bring her cat. I initially said no because I’m allergic, but she insisted he was hypoallergenic and excited to meet me, so I didn’t push back (my mistake).

The cat has been an issue since day one: he immediately peed everywhere and scratched the coffee table, so she started keeping him in her bedroom. The problem now is that he howls all night. When she’s not home, he screams constantly, which makes it hard when I’m on calls. He also randomly hisses and lunges at me even though I avoid him — he was feral and my roommate insists on keeping him indoors even though he clearly wants to go outside.

She loves him but I feel like she does what *she* wants with him (puts boots on him, cuddles him even when he scratches her) rather than what’s actually good for him. Honestly, I think he’d be happier as a barn/outdoor cat — he’s still basically feral, plus he’s overweight because she overfeeds him.

At this point he’s peeing around the apartment even during the day. She cleans it up but it still smells like pee and litter all the time. I don’t blame the cat, but it’s really affecting my quality of life. I don’t want to overstep or make her send him away, but I’m also stuck living with this demon cat until December and I don’t know what else to do. (We renting in for the summer-fall semester and housing is pain so neither of us really want to move out, plus she's a good roommate apart from Squeegee) 

Any advice on how to deal with this without crossing a line would be appreciated. Also — is it actually ethical to keep a  feral cat inside like this? Or am I overthinking it? She is constantly with the cat when she's home, and sets up treat mazes and tries to play with him but he lunges and scratches, she says he's just playing but in my opinion he's telling her to LEAVE HIM ALONE AND LET HIM OUTSIDE. I've brought up putting and AirTag on him and letting him roam like he used to and she said he would likely die within the week (we live by no major road, biggest wildlife is a raccoon) I get having a cat that was born indoors and keeping it that way because it's safer, but this is a feral cat who I think might be miserable. I don't know a lot about cats but both me and Squeegee are miserable in this apartment and I want to learn more- I'd never do anything to her cat without her permission im just asking if letting him out would fix these issues, in my opinion if Squeegee really liked being a house cat he'd come back to the apartment? 

(For clarity: I would *never* physically discipline him — I just use a firm voice or try to redirect. He has multiple litter boxes, cat trees, toys, and my roommate does “enrichment” stuff with him. Vet confirmed nothing is medically wrong and the peeing is behavioral.)",0,1755485046.0,CatAdvice,4,0.5,False

When she’s not home, he screams constantly, which makes it hard when I’m on calls. He also randomly hisses and lunges at me even though I avoid him — he was feral and my roommate insists on keeping him indoors even though he clearly wants to go outside.

She loves him but I feel like she does what *she* wants with him (puts boots on him, cuddles him even when he scratches her) rather than what’s actually good for him. Honestly, I think he’d be happier as a barn/outdoor cat — he’s still basically feral, plus he’s overweight because she overfeeds him.

At this point he’s peeing around the apartment even during the day. She cleans it up but it still smells like pee and litter all the time. I don’t blame the cat, but it’s really affecting my quality of life. I don’t want to overstep or make her send him away, but I’m also stuck living with this demon cat until December and I don’t know what else to do. (We renting in for the summer-fall semester and housing is pain so neither of us really want to move out, plus she's a good roommate apart from Squeegee) 

Any advice on how to deal with this without crossing a line would be appreciated. Also — is it actually ethical to keep a  feral cat inside like this? Or am I overthinking it? She is constantly with the cat when she's home, and sets up treat mazes and tries to play with him but he lunges and scratches, she says he's just playing but in my opinion he's telling her to LEAVE HIM ALONE AND LET HIM OUTSIDE. I've brought up putting and AirTag on him and letting him roam like he used to and she said he would likely die within the week (we live by no major road, biggest wildlife is a raccoon) I get having a cat that was born indoors and keeping it that way because it's safer, but this is a feral cat who I think might be miserable.

(For clarity: I would *never* physically discipline him — I just use a firm voice or try to redirect. He has multiple litter boxes, cat trees, toys, and my roommate does “enrichment” stuff with him. Vet confirmed nothing is medically wrong and the peeing is behavioral.)",1,1755484813.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False

I felt both sick and numb.
""You chose to tattoo her as$ rather than come home to me. You worked so long and hard on her tat that you couldn't even come home to sleep. Did you really sleep on the sofa by yourself? Were you even at the studio?""
""Tesh, you are taking this way too far. I can pull up the camera feed if you want. You'll see me on the couch, by myself.""
""You shouldn't have tattooed her. You really intend to add color to her tattoo in a few weeks?""
""Yeah. She's nothing more than a client and I have to finish the job. This is about my reputation.""
""So finishing her tattoo is more important than my feelings on the matter.""
_____________

Every morning, I had the pleasure of waking up to a man who was straight off the cover of a romance novel.
Literally.
My husband modeled and had become a highly coveted romance hero icon. He had dark good looks from his Italian father, gorgeous blue eyes, a hard-body build, abs you could climb like a ladder and incredible height like a tree.
That also made you want to climb him.
He had tattoos on both arms, and his chest and back were covered. His looks were rugged and had been tagged for MC, mafia and sports romances, but switch up his outfits a bit and he could morph seamlessly into a billionaire businessman or an undercover agent or a firefighter. His chest was sheer perfection and on ninety percent of his covers, he was shirtless.
Basilio was gorgeous, but more than that, he was good hearted, thoughtful and kind. He treated me like I was precious treasure and his attentiveness was the envy of all of my friends.
""Bas, you gotta quit treating Teshi so well,"" my friends' husbands would say. ""My wife is always on my case now with Bas did this and Bas did that for his wife.""
""Why wouldn't you do everything you could to make your wife happy?"" Bas had asked them, perplexed.
I was pretty enough, admittedly not cover-model material, but Bas always made me feel like the most beautiful woman in the world.
""You are,"" he told me simply when I protested his superlative, his eyes sparkling in appreciation. ""Don't argue with me.""
His eyes were already on me when I woke up, so he leaned over and pecked me. ""Good morning, Tesh.""
I snuggled closer to him. ""Good morning. What's on your plate today?""
""I have an online interview as Chase Miles for one hour, then I have a cologne shoot this afternoon and evening.""
Chase Miles was my husband's alter ego. He liked keeping his work life completely separate from his personal life, so when he'd begun modeling, he'd set up Chase Miles as his professional name.
After he asked what my day held, he pulled me out of bed and into the shower with him. First he got me dirty, then he concentrated on cleaning me up. Eventually, he went to his office in our home and I went to mine since I didn't have to be to work until later.
The first thing I did was log into Facebook because my husband wasn't the only one with an alter ego. I'd never told him that I belonged to several FB pages dedicated to pure smut, and I didn't use my real name. For my special groups, I was Smut Seeker10.
I checked out the pages I belonged to, adding about twenty more books to my ever-expanding TBR list, and when I got to the last page, I smiled in surprise. Apparently, Chase Miles was the Hot Guest Guy on the Dirty Girls Who Like 'Em Hot and Raunchy page. The page was dedicated to the men who appeared on the covers of romance novels, so it was a very niche group with a lot of good eye candy.
Bas was scheduled to begin the one hour Q&A in five minutes, and the admin for the page had just dumped a slideshow of every romance cover Chase had done. She'd also included some images of him taken from the internet from various photo shoots he'd done for colognes and underwear and other products.
Oh, this was going to be fun! I'd watched Bas in interviews before and he was charming, witty and very, very engaging. I'd never known him to do a guest spot on any FB pages before so this was new. He also had no idea I was a member of the page.
The admin introduced him, and then told everyone to put their questions in comments and Bas would answer as many as possible in the one hour he had. The admin was taking the questions and making each one an individual post for him to answer.
Q: Chase!! Huge fan! Dying to know since there's never any information on your personal life...are you married?
Yes, he is! To me!!!
Chase: Are you asking because I look miserable or something? No, not married and I have no interest in being tied down.
Um. What? Not married? No interest in being tied down? Bas, the correct answer is yes, I am happily married to the love of my life and have been for two years.
Q: YOU ARE SO HOT! Is it strictly professional with you and the female models you pose with?
Chase: While we're on a shoot, it is 100% professional. We're all there to do a job and that's it. But after we finish and hit the bars, we're so amped up from the shoot that we aren't thinking about being professional. We just let loose and have fun.
If I thought his answer to the marriage question was the worst, this one took my breath away. Did this mean he'd cheated on me when he had to be away overnight for his shoots? He always told me he went back up to his hotel room to unwind after a shoot. Now I was finding out that was a lie? A horrible lie.
Q: If you ever imagined yourself getting married, what would your ideal woman be like?
OK, Bas, time to turn this around. Describe me! Tall, blonde, brown eyes, lots of extra padding, pear-shaped, cute.
Chase: I love, respect and find beauty in all types of women, but if I *have* to describe my ideal woman, then I'm really partial to short, petite brunettes with gorgeous green eyes, a killer smile and dimples. But to get real for a bit, just because that's the fantasy, that doesn't mean you can't find happiness with a different reality.
I was practically gasping for air because someone had obviously reached down my throat and ripped out my lungs. Bas had just described the woman he was engaged to before he met me, right down to the dimples. I'd seen a couple of pictures of them on his IG account when I'd stalked him after we met. Following our second date, he'd deleted them.
""I don't need the past when I have you and a very bright future, Teshi.""
Maybe...maybe Bas was just trying to throw people off track from his real life. But for him to describe his ideal woman in such a detailed way...and it wasn't any description that could be applied to me by any stretch of the imagination.
The questions went on and on.
Q: Do you have any favorite women to pose with?
Chase: Definitely have favorites. There are some models you just ""click"" with on the set, and those shoots produce the hottest cover images because there's no faking the intensity with them. You're portraying a character, but for a brief moment, it feels real and that's when the photographer captures the moment. The authors or publishers recognize that, so it's pretty common to work together often when they see that connection in the pictures.
He'd always told me it was just lighting, angles and acting.
Knowing I'd hate myself for this, I typed in a question. The admin popped it up minutes later.
Q: Have you ever been in love?
Chase: Yes. A long, *dimpled* time ago. Someday, I hope to find that again.
Panic was beginning to set in and my breathing was way too erratic.
Q: Can we reach out to you?
Chase: Absolutely, I love hearing from fans!
And then he gave his Chase Miles email and provided a link to his FB page.
The admin came back, thanking Chase for his time and reminding anyone who lived in the Denver area that Chase would be attending a romance writer's conference and there would be a fundraiser event for a local women's shelter. As part of the fundraiser, a silent auction would be held and a dinner with Chase the night of the event would be one of the prizes.
I knew he had an overnight romance conference where he would be appearing at several authors' tables whose covers he'd been on, but that was the first I knew some woman could bid on a dinner with him and spend one-on-one time with my husband.
I wondered what else my husband did behind my back because I had no idea about any of this. With my mind spinning, unable to process all of his answers, I jerked in surprise when he knocked on my door before popping his head in.
""Hey, sweetheart, I'm heading out for my shoot. It's going to be late since a lot of the shoot is at night.""
""Bas, if I asked you to describe your ideal woman, what would you say?""
He looked confused at the sudden change of subject and the actual question. ""I'm looking right at her. You are my ideal.""
""So, not a short, petite brunette with gorgeous green eyes, a killer smile and dimples?""
His expression changed to wary.
""How about love, Bas? I know you were in love a long, dimpled time ago, but do you still hope to find that again?""
Now my handsome husband was looking extremely concerned.
""Oh, Bas, now you're looking downright miserable. Careful – someone might think you're married.""

One thing about Bas was he met issues head on. If I wasn't happy, he boldly waded right into the mess of my anger.
""Tesh,"" Bas said sternly, walking toward me, ""That was my Chase persona talking. I don't ever want the press to discover you, so no way would I admit that I'm married or describe you. You're not for public consumption. You're mine and I won't share you with anyone, and I sure wouldn't let the press get ahold of you.""
""You were describing your ex as your ideal!""
""Yeah. She and I attended some events when we were engaged, back when my modeling career was getting started and people saw us together. To my fans, it seems romantic that I'm still describing her even after we broke up, which gives me an excuse not to be seen with someone else in public. Makes me more in demand to be seen as a tragic figure, pining for a lost love. And it also keeps the press from sniffing around, possibly finding out about you and saying all sorts of nonsense about you.""
""I don't like any of what you said in that interview. You basically said if you can't have the fantasy, you have to settle for reality.""
Bas's eyes flashed angrily. ""No, what I said was just because that's the fantasy, that doesn't mean you can't find happiness with a different reality. That wasn't pointed at you, Tesh. It was pointed at women who look at me, think my looks are the ideal to strive for and then they feel dissatisfied with their real-life men. I've met some men at the romance writers' conventions and every time they all give me the stink eye and tell me how their wives or girlfriends get after them to work out more or just flat-out tell them they wished they looked more like me. That's pretty terrible to be with someone you don't think is absolutely perfect.""
""And what about the not strictly professional comment after a shoot? And having chemistry with the female models? You said you go back to your hotel after shoots!""
""I do go back to the hotel. I talked about chemistry because now the fans are going to go back over my covers and try to figure out if the chemistry was real with each of the ladies I posed with. These are comments specifically made to cause speculation, Tesh. To make Chase's life seem more exciting, to add to the fantasy.""
""I'm not happy with you.""
Bas came over and hugged me even though I didn't hug him back.
""Don't be mad, Tesh. I love you, and you are my ideal woman in every aspect.""
""Were you going to tell me about the dinner auction where you have some intimate dinner with whoever won you in the bidding war?""
He burst out laughing. ""Intimate dinner? Not even close. The twelve of us are being auctioned off for a dinner that takes place during the convention in full view of everyone else having dinner in the hotel ballroom. There will be four of us models at three different tables with the women who win us. So eight of us at a table. Hardly intimate because I wouldn't do that.""
""You have all the answers,"" I griped.
""I have all the answers because all the questions have simple explanations. I need to get going, but Tesh, remember that I love you. We can talk more if you want, but that was Chase answering those questions. Not me. I love you.""
Since I was feeling disgruntled with him, I didn't peck him back, so after my lips proved fruitless, he pressed a peck to my forehead and walked out.
When he got home late that night, I was already asleep in bed, otherwise I would have felt him pull me to him and spoon me. Bas couldn't stand not having me in his arms when he slept.
I popped out of bed an hour earlier than normal since I was meeting one of my favorite clients for a stretch before she had to get on a plane for too many hours to fly to Australia.
""Where you going?"" Bas mumbled. The man was usually awake before I was, so I knew the photo shoot must have gone very late.
""Early client.""
He sat up and stretched and even if I was mad at him, I still enjoyed the sight. But not as much as usual. So take that, Bas!
""I'll be at the studio until about seven. Let's plan on having a late dinner together since I'm leaving for the convention tomorrow. There's a meet and greet tomorrow night, then the convention all day Saturday and the dinner and auction Saturday night. Going to try to fit in a quick coffee with Elsie Sunday morning.""

Bas, by trade, was a tattoo artist for an exclusive studio, which is where he was actually discovered by a new client, Elsie, who worked for a well-known romance publisher. She'd taken one look at the man about to ink her and told him she wanted him for book covers. At first, he'd thought she was messing with him, but he took a chance and met with her, and his modeling career had begun.
He usually modeled once or twice a week -- those book covers had led to other opportunities -- and he worked his free days at the tattoo studio. He specialized in fine line tattoos and had a wait list, which meant whenever he was available, the clients flocked to him and his wait list grew. He always looked at modeling realistically and knew the years he could model would be limited, so he felt it was important to keep working as a tattoo artist.
""When am I going to get you in my chair?"" he always asked me with a grin, trailing his fingers over my skin. Bas teased me, but he was serious about wanting to tattoo me. ""All that virgin skin, just begging for my designs.""
""When I get over my fear of all those little needle pricks,"" I always answered back.
""Sure you can't join me this weekend?"" he asked, coming to stand in front of me undressed before sweetening the pot. ""Some of your favorite authors are going to be there.""
""Wish I could, but I have work on Saturday morning."" That was a lie. I'd made a last minute swap with one of my colleagues so I could attend the auction. I wanted to see exactly what happened at one.
At that, I twisted away from his hands, and he frowned.
""I don't like you moving away from me, Teshi.""
I shrugged. ""I don't like you saying what you did in that Facebook interview.""
""Can we talk about it tonight? Or when I get back on Sunday so tonight can just be nice?""
With the other surprise I'd been planning for him tonight, we would have had a nice night. Or a temporary truce, at least. He would have been over the moon when I walked into his room at the studio because I'd finally decided to let him ink me, and even though I was unhappy with him, I wasn't going to back out...I might never get the courage again.
I'd booked the appointment weeks ago under a fake name, figuring I could use the time to really psych myself up for needles and pain. Paige, the receptionist, was the only one who knew it was me, and I was surprised she hadn't ruined the surprise for Bas. She'd been a friend of his former fiancée, and although she normally was casually dismissive of me, she sometimes made sly little digs.
""He prefers his women tattooed,"" Paige would say while I waited for Bas. ""Regina let him ink her as often as possible.""
Ah, yes, the ideal, dimpled, petite Regina.
""Yet that didn't keep them together, did it?"" I asked coolly. ""I'm married to him and she's...a footnote in his life who used to wear his ring.""
I never told Bas about her catty comments because I believed in either handling bitches myself or ignoring them when they were trying so hard to get a reaction. And Bas would have had a reaction because nobody was allowed to say anything against me.
Except his alter ego, Chase Miles, in a roundabout way.
Paige called me an hour before I was supposed to walk into the studio.
""Sorry, Teshi, I have to cancel your appointment.""
""Is Bas OK?""
""Yeah. He had a urgent request from a really important client, and he told me to cancel everything tonight.""
""OK.""
""Would you like to reschedule now?"" she asked sweetly.
""I'll call back next week.""
""So sorry it didn't work out for tonight, but this is kind of a rush and it's a very detailed, intricate tattoo, so it's going to take a long time.""
""Got it,"" I said.
It wouldn't make sense to me until later why she was being so polite and chatty. But if the first dot had dropped during the Chase Miles interview, the second dot would be dropping soon. And the third dot would be dropping not long after, and I'd finally be able to connect them.
My phone rang not long after I hung up with Paige. Bas.
""I'm sorry, Tesh, but I'm going to be really late tonight. Had a last-minute client who's on a time crunch and she needs this tattoo done tonight so it has time to heal before a photoshoot she has coming up in a few weeks.""
Bas had a lot of high-end clients who were models, actors, rockstars, country music stars, so this last-minute request wasn't out of the ordinary.
""OK.""
I knew if he'd realized I was one of the appointments he'd had Paige call to reschedule, he wouldn't have canceled me.
How adorable was I for thinking that?
""Teshi, you know I'd rather be home with you. Can we have breakfast before you head to work tomorrow?""
""If you want to get up early and make it, sure. I have to be at work by seven thirty, though.""
""I'll make you whatever you want."" He paused, and his voice was heavy. ""I'm sorry, Tesh.""
""Not a problem.""
I'd find out later what a lie that was. It was a big problem.
And about to get bigger.
""Where are you?"" I texted my husband. I'd awakened to an empty bed and an empty house. Bas's side of the bed had never been slept in, and I checked the two other bedrooms in the house and those also were empty.
I heard the front door open.
""I'm right here,"" he said, obviously having read the text I'd sent only seconds ago.
He came over to me to give me a hug, but I stepped back, hands on my hips.
""Where were you all night?""
""The tattoo took forever, so after she left the studio, I cleaned up and crashed on the couch.""
""Alone?""
Now Bas took a step back. ""What the heck, Teshi? Yes, alone.""
""Why not come home?""
""Because I was wiped out, bleary eyed and didn't want to wake you up.""
""And no text to tell me what was going on?""
""I should have, Tesh. I'm sorry for worrying you. I made a bad judgment call, but again, it was really late, I knew you were probably asleep since you hadn't texted and I didn't want to wake you up.""
""The last two days haven't been good, Bas. And you cancelled on us last night for a tattoo but told me we could have breakfast together before I left for work.""
""I'm sorry I missed making you breakfast,"" he said. ""I'm sorry about everything, Tesh. peck me before you go, and I'll see you Sunday night, but I'll call you every day. Any particular books from your favorite authors you want signed?""
""Sorry, Bas. I don't feel like pecking you, and I don't want you to get me any books.""
I'd get them myself.
""I'll text you my schedule so you'll know when I have down time and you can expect a call.""
I shrugged, more upset with my husband than I'd ever been. Something felt off. Those dots I hadn't connected yet.
""I'm heading off to work.""
Bas snagged me around the waist. ""Tesh, I don't care how mad you are, we don't leave the house, especially if one of us is traveling, without a peck.""
That was true, so I gave in a bit and pecked him briefly. Nothing like our usual deep, ravenous pecks. Bas noticed because he sighed.
""I love you, Tesh.""
""I love you, too.""
He reluctantly let me go then, and I drove to work, my head definitely not in the mood. Honestly, giving a massage this morning would be easier than stretching my client because I didn't have to talk while I gave a massage.
I managed to pull on my professionalism by the time I arrived at work, and my client was none the wiser about my bad, suspicious mood. My other clients followed her, and by the time lunch rolled around, I was starving. I'd had my phone on vibrate, so I was expecting a few texts from Bas and I wasn't disappointed.
I hate that I let you down last night and this morning. I'm sorry, baby.
Getting ready to leave, but I wish I could stay and talk with you. I want you to feel better and I hate that I made you suspicious of me.
I love you, Teshi. You are my ideal woman in every way.
Babe, I'm in the car about to drive away. I'll call you when I get there, and I'll miss you until I can get back to you and make everything right.
Wanting to believe him but not quite able to, I sighed at his texts and walked to the deli next door to get a sandwich. Why is it you're swimming along nicely, then you suddenly hit a riptide and feel like you're being pulled out to sea? I pondered that as I ate my sandwich and my phone chimed.
Pulling it out of my pocket, I saw that I'd been tagged in a picture of some woman's as$. She had a bikini top on and nothing down below, not even a thong. She had an intricate, detailed and delicate tattoo that rounded her hips and trailed over her entire as$.
The tattoo took forever...
Had a last-minute client who's on a time crunch and she needs this tattoo done tonight so it has time to heal before a photoshoot she has coming up in a few weeks.
OK, I wasn't going to freak out. Both Bas and I had jobs that required us to have our hands all over other people's bodies. We had talked about that early on in our relationship and how to prevent jealousy, so I wasn't ready to throw a fit.
Until.
Until I read the caption.
Nothing like having your ex's hands all over you again. Thanks, Bas, for fitting me in last night.

Chapter 1

""Hara, Ells is trending everywhere now. Reporters have completely blocked the hotel entrance. Could you handle this?""

It was 10:00 p.m.

Sitting at her desk, Harriet Chavez pinched the bridge of her nose, listening in silence as Patsy Medina, her mother-in-law, talked on the phone.

She was married to Ellsworth Townsend for three years, dealing with his scandals and mistresses almost every single day.

The few times she saw him, it was always about handling his affairs.

As Harriet remained silent, Patsy said earnestly, ""Hara, it's not just about the company's reputation or the stock price anymore. Kelsey's back. You know she isn't just any woman. You gotta protect your marriage with Ells.""

Kelsey Graham was back?

Harriet frowned slightly, a wave of weariness washing over her.

After a few more seconds, she finally replied, her voice gentle, ""I see, Patsy. I'm on it.""

After hanging up, she stared at her phone wearily for quite a while before grabbing her car keys and leaving.

\*\*\*

Half an hour later, Harriet entered through the hotel's back entrance and went upstairs.

Zane Herman, the Townsend family's servant, and Jolene Martinez, her secretary, were waiting for her by the door.

With a luxury shopping bag in hand, Jolene walked toward her. ""Ms. Chavez, the clothes are ready.""

It was identical to Kelsey's outfit tonight, prepared to help Ellsworth out of this.

Zane knocked on the door. ""Mr. Townsend, Mrs. Townsend is here.""

""Come in.""

Ellsworth's flat voice rang out. He didn't sound guilty or flustered at all.

Zane opened the door for Harriet just as Ellsworth walked out of the bathroom, his loose gray sleepwear doing little to conceal the toned muscles of his chest and abdomen. He towel-dried his hair casually, radiating effortless allure.

He was still calm when he saw Harriet, not guilty or embarrassed at all for being caught having an affair.

After three years, they were both used to this.

Ellsworth bent down and picked up a cigarette case and a lighter from the coffee table. He shook a cigarette out, held it between his lips, and leaned in to light it.

He exhaled a smoke ring and greeted Harriet as if nothing had happened. ""Hey.""

Harriet nodded and said in a businesslike tone, ""I'll go get changed.""

With that, she took the clothes handed by Jolene and walked toward the bedroom.

Just then, Kelsey stepped out, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear.

Harriet stopped abruptly at the doorway.

Kelsey... really was back.

At the sight of Harriet, Kelsey was momentarily stunned. But soon, she regained her composure and smiled, ""Hey, Hara.""

Then she patted Harriet's head and said softly, ""Thanks for your help, Hara.""

Harriet instinctively tightened her grip on the clothes and managed to say, ""Don't mention it, Kelsey.""

Back then, she was unaware that Kelsey was Ellsworth's first love and that he had never stopped loving her.

If she had known, she wouldn't have nodded when Ellsworth's grandfather, Raymond Townsend, asked her if she loved Ellsworth. Then Ellsworth wouldn't have been forced to marry her.

She wouldn't have been a complete joke.

Ellsworth was decisive and meticulous in everything he did. Under his leadership, the Townsend Group had risen to new heights.

Even senior executives twice his age had to treat him with respect, not daring to mess with him at all.

Yet this paragon of discretion had been so reckless in his personal life.

Harriet could think of only one reason-he must've been furious about the marriage. This was his way of humiliating her and getting back at Raymond.

Kelsey withdrew her hand and walked past Harriet, who instinctively turned around to look.

At the sight of Kelsey, Ellsworth handed her a coat and said gently, ""Put it on. I hate to see you catch a cold.""

""You're so sweet."" Kelsey smiled at him, looking genuinely happy.

Chapter 2

Harriet was flooded with a complicated mix of emotions as she looked at them.

Ellsworth used to be nice to her, saying yes to her every request. He had even carried her out from a fire once.

How had they ended up like this?

After staring at them for a while, Harriet stepped into the bedroom without saying a word.

As she walked out again in the white dress identical to Kelsey's, Kelsey had already left.

So had Jolene and Zane.

Meanwhile, someone kept banging on the door.

""Mr. Townsend, is it true that you're getting a divorce?""

""Mr. Townsend, are you with Ms. Graham now?""

If anyone had taken photos of Ellsworth and Kelsey together, the Townsend Group's stock would be in freefall tomorrow.

Ellsworth uncrossed his legs, tossed his phone away, and stood up. Then he strolled to the door and opened it.

""Mr. Townsend, will Ms. Chavez still work at the Townsend Group after the divorce? How much will she get?""

""Mr. Townsend, the whole town is waiting for your divorce negotiations. Will she get the Townsend Group's shares?""

Still standing by the bedroom door, Harriet chuckled. The reporters sounded so certain about a divorce-they sure had a knack for predicting things.

Looking at them, she steeled herself and walked gracefully behind Ellsworth.

She wrapped her slender arms around his waist, rested her chin on his shoulder, and asked in an affectedly sweet voice, ""Darling, what's going on?""

Ellsworth spun around the moment she hugged him and murmured ""Darling.""

""Ms. Chavez?""

""Ms. Chavez?""

""It's Ms. Chavez, not Ms. Graham.""

The reporters went into a frenzy, snapping photos the second Harriet showed up, thinking they had finally caught Ellsworth in some major gossip.

However, they were disappointed again. Like always, it was Harriet.

Harriet kept her arms around Ellsworth's waist as he turned to the reporters and asked lazily, ""Need me to clarify anything?""

""Mr. Townsend, Ms. Chavez, sorry for interrupting you.""

""Mr. Townsend, please forgive us.""

They hastily apologized and then left.

Ellsworth closed the door and turned around. Harriet quickly withdrew her arms and explained, ""It was just to convince the reporters.""

She was polite yet distant.

Ellsworth didn't say anything. He walked to the coat rack and took off his robe, his back to her.

He had broad shoulders and a lean waist.

Thanks to years of working out, every cut and curve of his body was perfectly defined.

Harriet's cheeks heated. She lowered her head and then said quietly, ""I'm going back to the office.""

Then she opened the door and left.

Ellsworth turned and stared at the door for a long time.

Then he continued to get dressed.

\*\*\*

On the way back, Harriet clutched the steering wheel with both hands, feeling exhausted.

Her chest tightened.

Last month, during her check-up, a small nodule was found. The doctor recommended she avoid stress and scheduled regular monitoring appointments.

The nodule had appeared only after her marriage.

She turned to glance at the divorce agreement on the passenger seat and sighed helplessly.

In fact, she had taken it with her into the room.

But she took it back.

Over the past three years, she had considered a divorce countless times. However, the scene where Ellsworth carried her out of the fire always emerged in her mind, stopping her from bringing it up.

What if Ellsworth agreed to the divorce? Then there'd be no going back.

So, she had held onto those papers.

\*\*\*

After Harriet solved the scandal crisis, everything returned to normal.

It was like nothing had happened at all.

One morning, when Harriet passed by the small conference room, she heard voices inside.

""You want me to do it again? Ellsworth, spare me. I've already done it six times.""

""I'm so jealous of Harriet. Marrying you completely changed her life, Ellsworth. She doesn't even have to handle proposals anymore. All she does is sign contracts.""

Chapter 3

""You're jealous of her? About what? How calculating she is? The way she wraps people around her finger? Or her world-class tolerance? Did you see the trending topics that night? She went for another cover-up for Ellsworth. None of us could ever do that."" Another woman clicked her tongue.

Then a male's voice rang out. ""Ellsworth, they say you and Ms. Graham were doing it when Harriet walked into the room. That's truly heartbreaking! Did she cry?""

Amused, Ellsworth asked, ""Where did you hear that? That's quite a story.""

The truth was, when he and Kelsey were having dinner that night, the waiter accidentally spilled juice on them, so they went upstairs to change their clothes. That was all.

But he didn't explain anything. He didn't give a damn about what others thought, let alone Harriet's feelings.

""Ellsworth, you're way out of Harriet's league. Why don't you divorce her and give someone else a shot?""

Harriet stood frozen outside the door.

Inside, Ellsworth was talking about his affair as if he were discussing the weather, looking nonchalant and even happy.

Her gaze fixed on him.

Ellsworth's current project was assigned by the government and was being handled by some of his close friends.

He had never allowed Harriet to get involved in projects like this.

After getting married, he kept her at a complete distance. She was excluded from his social life and his personal life, and their relationship grew more strained than it had ever been.

Lounging on the chair, Johnathan Burton, one of Ellsworth's friends, said, ""Ells, ignore their nonsense. Hara's been managing things at work and taking care of everything at home.

""She not only tolerated your affairs. She even dealt with them. What other woman would do that?

""You're like the luckiest man in the world. If I were you, I'd keep her close and never let her go.""

Brittany Vaughn, Ellsworth's loyal admirer, immediately retorted, ""I can do those things too, and I'd be even better.

""Ellsworth, divorce her and marry me. My family's significantly wealthier, and I'd be a stronger ally in every way.""

""Get real, Brittany. Have you forgotten about Kelsey?""

Ellsworth joked with a smile, ""Brittany, let me know when your family has the wedding gifts for us ready.""

Laughter broke out in the conference room. Harriet turned around and went back to her office in silence.

She did come from an ordinary family.

Her mother, a teacher, died from an illness when she was eight years old. Her father, a police officer, died in the line of duty a few years ago.

Though her grandfather, Ralph Chavez, had been in the military, he wasn't exactly high-ranking-he drove for Raymond.

That was why she and Ellsworth had known each other since childhood.

After the marriage, Raymond had arranged for her to be the company's VP, supporting Ellsworth.

She knew what he really wanted was for her to keep Ellsworth in check.

But she had failed.

Harriet took the divorce papers from the drawer, gazing at them for a long time.

She should have stopped lying to herself a long time ago. Deep down, she had always known she could never win Ellsworth's heart.

All of a sudden, she wanted to give up.

She didn't want to separate him from the love of his life.

So, when the meeting was over, Harriet went to Ellsworth.

As she reached his office door, he happened to open it from inside.

He seemed a bit surprised at the sight of her. ""What's up?""

She said, ""A couple of documents need your signature.""

He sat back at his desk and picked up a pen.

After he signed the documents, Harriet slid two copies of the divorce agreement across the desk and said flatly, ""When you're free, let's get a divorce.""

His right hand, still holding the pen, hovered mid-air as he looked up at her.

Chapter 4

After a while, Ellsworth said with a half-smile, ""This is so typical of you, always following your own rules. This marriage only happened because you insisted on it. And now, you want a divorce?""

Harriet didn't withdraw her hand holding the divorce agreement. ""I gave it some serious thought. I don't think we're cut out for each other. Besides, I didn't know about you and Kelsey back then. And I didn't know...""

He interrupted her before she could finish, ""Harriet, it's true that Kelsey's back. But that doesn't mean you get to play games. Also, playing hard to get doesn't work with me.""

To him, Harriet had always coveted his family's fame and power. With her calculated charm, she had sweet-talked Raymond into welcoming her as part of the family.

She actually claimed she wanted a divorce? Did she really expect him to buy that?

Harriet didn't know what to say, facing Ellsworth's prejudice against her.

He thought she was playing hard to get?

There was nothing she could do to change the way he thought of her.

Back then, he had loved Kelsey and hated her. But how could she possibly know that?

She clutched the papers so tightly that the veins on the back of her hand were bulging.

But she had to maintain her composure and elegance. She said, her voice still steady, ""Ellsworth, I don't care what you think this is. You'll know whether I'm serious about the divorce once we go to the courthouse.""

Sensing the resolution in her voice, Ellsworth glanced at her before saying indifferently, ""Alright. You want a divorce? Sure.""

Then he added, ""But is Sir Chavez OK with this? Have you gotten the birth certificate? Have you told my grandpa? Has he agreed to this?

""If you really want a divorce, get them to agree first before coming to me. Don't waste my time.""

His casual questioning left Harriet speechless.

He was right. It was impossible for her to get a divorce just because she wanted it.

Marriage was never just about two people. She had to take their families into consideration.

Pale-faced, she looked at Ellsworth, not saying a word. He stood up and said, still deadpan, ""Otherwise, stick to your roles as the company's VP and my wife.""

Her right hand, gripping the papers, hovered mid-air. She parted her lips, wanting to explain, but no words came out.

After quite a while, she said, ""I didn't think it through. I'll talk to them as soon as possible.""

This time, he didn't bother to respond. He just left the office with both hands in his pockets.

She wanted a divorce?

Yeah, right.

Till today, he still vividly remembered how thrilled she had been the day they got married.

As he closed the door, Harriet pinched the bridge of her nose and exhaled deeply.

\*\*\*

Back at her office, Harriet told Kathie Townsend about her conversation with Ellsworth.

Kathie was Ellsworth's younger sister, and she also worked at the company.

She was the same age as Harriet, and they had been thick as thieves since childhood.

Kathie had been away on a business trip for the past few days.

She and Ellsworth had an older brother, Kenneth Townsend, who worked in the military.

""Finally, Hara. I'm so glad you thought it through."" On the phone, Kathie sounded both relieved and surprised.

""Chill. I've got your back. Just ask Sir Chavez for your birth certificate. With his and my grandpa's approval, I'm sure you can get a divorce. I'll talk to my grandpa.""

""Thank you, Kat.""

""Don't say that.""

To Kathie, with everything Ellsworth had done, he didn't deserve to be Harriet's husband at all. Otherwise, she wouldn't have helped Harriet get a divorce.

With Kathie's support, Harriet instantly felt much more confident.

Come evening, she clocked out and went home.

The Chavez's mansion was located in an old alley downtown.

Chapter 5

Having been renovated a few times over the years, the two-story mansion maintained its classical essence while embracing modern sophistication.

Red roses cascaded over the courtyard wall, whispering in the breeze in contrast to the quiet alley.

Harriet pulled over and then entered the mansion with Ralph's favorite pastries.

""Ms. Chavez, you're back,"" said Deloris Henson, the maid.

""Hey, Deloris.""

Harriet nodded at her before going to Ralph.

Most twenty-three-year-olds came with effortless youth and sunlit vitality, dressing like a walking rainbow.

Yet Harriet had always dressed in muted tones. She seldom smiled, her hair always a low chignon.

After all, she was the company's VP, Ellsworth's wife.

She spent the entire evening keeping Ralph company.

After dinner, they played chess. Only then did he say, ""You've been frowning since you came back. Tell me. What's bothering you?""

Holding a piece, Harriet looked up at him.

After a few minutes, she said, ""Grandpa, I don't wanna be with Ellsworth anymore. I want a divorce.""

She didn't say this impulsively. It was a decision based on serious deliberation.

Ralph's expression darkened as he fell silent.

After a long time, he stood up, went to his bedroom, and returned soon.

""Back then, I asked you if you were sure. You said yes,"" he said, still looking grim.

Then he sighed helplessly, not bothering to scold her, ""Never mind. You've done everything you could in this marriage. You came back for your birth certificate, right? Fine. If a divorce is what you want, so be it. Perhaps it'll be a relief for both you and Ells.""

Saying this, he handed her the birth certificate.

He wasn't one for online news, but he had heard about Ellsworth enough.

Since Ellsworth didn't have any feelings for Harriet, a divorce might be the best choice.

Love couldn't be compelled.

Harriet's eyes reddened as her gaze fell upon the birth certificate in Ralph's hand. ""Grandpa, I'm sorry.""

She had made herself a joke in the marriage. Worst, Ralph had been humiliated, too.

Putting the birth certificate into her hand, Ralph sat down. ""You don't have to say sorry to anyone. I just want you to be happy-promise me you'll stay away from those who upset you.""

Tightening her grip on the birth certificate, Harriet nodded.

The nameless sadness still lingered, though she didn't know what she was sad about.

It was past 9:00 p.m.

Leaving the mansion, she sent Kathie a message and a photo on WhatsApp.

""Kat, I've got the birth certificate.""

Soon, Kathie sent her a sixty-second voice message, telling her what to do next.

\*\*\*

Ellsworth was drinking with his friends in a bar, including Johnathan and Darrick Lozano.

The flickering neon lights cast hues across their faces and the glasses on the table.

Ellsworth's life was far livelier than Harriet's.

Several women tried to cozy up to him, but he showed no response.

Lounging on the couch lazily, Johnathan said with a roguish smile while looking at him, ""I heard Hara proposed a divorce. Is that true?""

Ellsworth picked up a cigarette and a lighter from the table and lit it.

Blowing out a thin wisp of smoke expertly, he flicked off some ash and smiled, ""You're well-informed, just as always. What does Kat want to know this time?""

Johnathan shook his head. ""Enough is enough, Ells. Being your wife hasn't been easy for Hara. You can have fun however you want, but at least go back once in a while and sweet-talk her.""

""Sweet-talk her?""

Ellsworth let out a cold sneer while smoking.

Sweet-talk Harriet?

Not going to happen.

Just then, the screen of his phone on the table lit up.

Kathie texted him on WhatsApp, ""Ells, just so you know, Hara has gotten her birth certificate.""

She then forwarded the photo of Harriet's birth certificate to him.

He was slightly surprised.

Harriet had indeed come to Ralph for her birth certificate? She was... serious about getting a divorce?

Chapter 6

He zoomed in on the photo, scrutinizing the image extremely carefully till the burning cigarette stung his fingers. Only then did he snap out of it and toss his phone away.

A second later, it rang, the screen lighting up with ""Mom"" flashing on it.

He unlocked to answer and then heard her voice. ""Ells, where are you tonight? Could you stop being such a handful at least once in a while and go stay home for a couple of nights?

""You've always left Hara alone back home. How could you do this to her?""

He frowned. ""Did she put a spell on you on what? All of you side with her. Enough. I see.""

Everyone else in the family liked Harriet, including Raymond, Kathie, and his parents.

What was so good about her?

He hung up and stood up. Picking up his suit jacket, he said to Johnathan and Darrick expressionlessly, ""I gotta go. Something came up.""

Johnathan straightened up a little, arching an eyebrow. ""The show hasn't even started yet. Are you sure?""

No longer in the mood, he waved his hand while heading to the bar entrance.

He started his car, leaving the car window open.

Steering the wheel with his right hand, he rested his left arm on the window frame with a cigarette between his fingers. The rhythm of ""Five Hundred Miles"" through the Burmester sound system echoed in the car.

He still didn't get it. There was nothing special about Harriet. How could she wrap everyone else in the family around her little finger?

And... What was he thinking, agreeing to marry her in the first place?

He took a drag from his cigarette and then exhaled a slow swirl of smoke.

Seeing only a few cars in sight, he flicked away the half-smoked cigarette and slammed the accelerator. With a roar, the car surged forward and soon disappeared into the distance.

\*\*\*

In the bedroom of the villa.

Harriet took some shower gel and skincare products from the bathroom and reached for the bedroom door. Just then, someone opened it.

She looked up.

Then she was dumbfounded.

Ellsworth?

What was he doing back?

Ellsworth had only come home a handful of times over the past three years. At the sight of him, Harriet was utterly stunned.

She blurted out, ""Why are you back?""

Immediately, she explained, ""I'm not saying you can't come back. I mean, it's your home, and you can come back anytime you want.""

She added after a brief pause, ""I haven't used the bathroom or slept in the bed for a while now. Jacquelyn and the others clean and disinfect every day.""

Jacquelyn Becker was one of the servants here.

As Harriet said this, some memories flashed across her mind. She had once grabbed Ellsworth's sleeve, and he had tossed the black suit jacket away later.

From then on, she had never touched him or his things again unless necessary.

If he wanted to stay the night, she didn't want him to be disgusted by her presence in the master bedroom.

The truth was, she had moved into the guest room next door shortly after their marriage.

Ellsworth took off his jacket and casually tossed it onto the couch.

She stepped aside to make way.

Since he didn't say anything, she lowered her head, ready to step out with the things she had taken from the bathroom. Just then, he asked, his voice icy, ""You've got the birth certificate?""

Looking at him, she nodded. ""Yes. Grandpa gave it to me. I don't think Sir Townsend will raise any objections either.""

She used to call Raymond by his first name, but Ellsworth always addressed Ralph as ""Sir Chavez"", as if drawing a clear boundary between the two families. Eventually, she, too, began calling Raymond ""Sir Townsend"".

She had also heard Ellsworth loved Kelsey very much.

Chapter 7

It was most likely true-after all, all his rumored girlfriends resembled Kelsey in a certain way.

So, what was the point of clinging to him, trying to win his favor?

Ellsworth glanced at her and then tugged at his collar, revealing his collarbones and slender neck, which effortlessly exuded a roguish charm.

She said, ""I'm going back to the guest room, then.""

As she pulled open the door, she found Jacquelyn eavesdropping outside.

The atmosphere froze for a second.

""Mrs. Harriet Townsend,"" Jacquelyn smiled awkwardly. Then she whispered, ""Mrs. Patsy Townsend just called. She wanted to remind you to seize the opportunity.

""It's getting late. Mr. Townsend, Mrs. Harriet Townsend, I'll get out of your hair now.""

After saying that, she closed the door and left.

Standing at the doorway, Harriet felt torn.

Pondering for a while, she turned to look at Ellsworth. ""I'll go to the guest room later.""

Still saying nothing, he rummaged through the closet, his upper body bare.

It was so typical of him-he had always ignored her, never responding to her calls or texts.

She had endured emotional neglect since day one of their three-year marriage.

At first, she'd feel embarrassed and sad, but now? She felt nothing.

Assuming he was looking for his sleepwear, she placed the things in her arms onto the couch, walked toward him, and opened the adjacent closet door. ""All your sleepwear is here.""

She didn't reach for them, steering clear of his things as always.

He took a dark gray set and entered the bathroom, not sparing a glance at her.

After he stepped inside, she couldn't help but exhale.

It was so suffocating.

He made her feel like she owed him a lot.

After a while, Ellsworth finished his shower. He stepped out in his sleepwear, towel-drying his hair casually.

Harriet was sitting cross-legged on the sofa, working on her laptop.

As his icy gaze fell upon her, he had to admit-he was surprised to see her get her birth certificate back.

But her title as the company's VP meant so much to her.

Could she really bear to give it up?

Harriet didn't notice him. In fact, she had completely forgotten that he was here.

She was slightly startled when she heard his footsteps.

Standing up with the laptop in her arms, she said, ""Jacquelyn and the others should be asleep by now. Get some rest.""

Suddenly, she tumbled back onto the couch.

She bent forward to rub her calves.

Her loose pajama top gaped, exposing her cleavage.

Her skin was flawless, radiating an innocent yet intoxicating allure.

Ellsworth's gaze deepened.

A divorce?

That was just her excuse to let his guard down. What she really wanted was to climb into his bed.

She said while looking up, seeming quite embarrassed, ""My feet fell asleep.""

Ellsworth looked at her coldly. All of a sudden, he hurled the towel at her and snapped, ""Harriet, what tricks are you pulling this time?""

The towel landed accurately on her right cheek, which hurt.

She lowered her head and fell silent for several seconds. Then she put the towel on the couch, struggled to stand up, and said flatly, ""Rest assured, Ellsworth. I'm not pulling any tricks. I'm serious about the divorce.""

She had been crazy about him in the early days of their marriage.

That year, she was only twenty. She had done everything she could-hitting on him, learning to cook and brew coffee for him, and prioritizing his needs every time.

He had been her entire world.

But not anymore.

She limped toward the door, her gaze inadvertently falling upon Ellsworth's face when she walked past him.

The disgusted look on his face drained the light from her eyes.

After returning to the guest room, she leaned against the door for a long time.

Eventually, she smiled self-mockingly.

The melancholy made her stomach ache again. Frowning, she rubbed her lower abdomen and sat on the bed after feeling better.

Chapter 8

She had been suffering from stomach pain and nausea for quite some time now.

The next day, she went to the hospital for a general check-up. The doctor said there was nothing serious, so she drove back to the company shortly after.

""Hara.""

The elevator arrived at the office floor. As she stepped out, she heard a familiar voice.

Looking up, she saw Kelsey walking toward her in a red dress with a warm smile.

She greeted Kelsey, ""Hello, Kelsey.""

Still smiling, Kelsey gave her a once-over and said, ""It's been a couple of years, and you've become even prettier, Hara.""

She put on a smile as well. ""You, too, Kelsey.""

Kelsey and Ellsworth were of the same age, both three years older than her.

She wasn't exactly their childhood friend. Given the gap in their family backgrounds, she was at best a fringe presence in their inner circle.

In the past, Ellsworth would occasionally invite her to hang out with them. But now, only Kathie remained her friend.

Kelsey smiled, ""Hara, you haven't had lunch, right? Wanna join me?""

She shook her head. ""Another time, maybe. I have to...""

But Kelsey interrupted her before she could finish, ""Come on, Hara. Don't tell me you'll have lunch later. I ran into Jolene a few minutes ago, and she told me you went to the hospital for a stomach check-up. How are you supposed to work with an empty stomach? Let's go.""

When saying this, she grabbed Harriet's hand, leaving no room for refusal.

The radiant smile on her face made it difficult for Harriet to say no.

They soon arrived at a restaurant, and Kelsey poured some water for Harriet. ""I know all about Ells' bad temper. Those years must have been tough for you.""

Harriet smiled, ""It's OK. We rarely see each other after all.""

Knowing Kelsey was fishing for information, she said this truthfully.

Kelsey and Ellsworth were bound to be together. Why would she stand in their way?

After pouring the water, Kelsey put down the carafe. ""This isn't a long-term solution. What are your plans, Hara?""

Picking up the glass, Harriet took a sip of the water and said, ""Ellsworth and I are splitting up. My grandpa has already given me my birth certificate, and I don't think Sir Townsend will have an issue with it either.""

Ellsworth didn't want to stay with her, and now, the feeling was mutual.

Kelsey sighed, ""I feel so awful. If I hadn't kept things hidden back then, none of this would have happened. But I guess there's a silver lining after all-you don't have children, which makes things much easier.""

Harriet smiled, ""You're right.""

Just then, Kelsey waved at someone behind her. ""Over here, Ells.""

Harriet turned around, only to see Ellsworth walking over in his navy-blue suit, brimming with vigor and vitality.

Somehow, she felt he was glowing.

His presence always outshone everything and everyone around him.

Ellsworth's expression darkened a little when he saw Harriet.

I've been messing around with wired CarPlay on my 2016 Civic lately, and it's really driving me crazy. Every time I drive, it's like surgery: plugging and unplugging, cleaning coffee stains...
A friend recommended the CarProKit wireless adapter, saying it works amazingly, but the official website seems to have several versions, and I'm completely confused 🤯.
So, I'd like to ask you veterans:
I was originally planning to try their 4.0 version (which supports wireless CarPlay and Android Auto, so I don't have to mess with USB!), but when I checked compatibility, I saw:
""Only compatible with 2017 and later models"" (I have a 2016 LX, and the head unit is super old, it might even only have one TF card slot...).
Now I'm torn:
Should I take the risk and try 4.0? Supporters say it's reliable, but others suggest it might be risky for the car's electrical system...
Or should I go with the legendary 2.0 version ""for older cars""? But I'm really eager to try out all the cool features in 4.0, like split-screen...
Fellow 2016 owners, have you tried:
Installing 4.0 directly? Does it work reliably?
How smooth are 2.0/3.0 versions? Will it be so laggy that I almost drop my phone?
I'm also considering upgrading my head unit, but my student budget is really limited...
I'd really appreciate some real-world experiences! Car technology has advanced so rapidly in recent years, but can our older cars keep up? I'd love to hear your stories and suggestions!",0,1755484492.0,CarPlay,1,0.5,False

Peters was found guilty of allowing a man to misuse a security card to access to the Mesa County election system and for being deceptive about that person's identity:[ https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republican-election-denier-tina-peters-sentenced-to-9-years-in-prison-for-voting-data-scheme](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/republican-election-denier-tina-peters-sentenced-to-9-years-in-prison-for-voting-data-scheme). In 2025, Trump called on the Department of Justice to take ""all necessary action"" to secure the release of Tina Peters. As her convictions involve state crimes, she is not eligible for a federal pardon: [https://coloradonewsline.com/2025/07/22/judge-tina-peters-request-release/](https://coloradonewsline.com/2025/07/22/judge-tina-peters-request-release/)

PENNSYLVANIA AND ARIZONA: In other states, Trump-aligned lawyer Sidney Powell used less overtly illegal methods to seek to gain access to election machinery: [https://azmirror.com/2021/05/24/group-led-by-kraken-lawyer-sidney-powell-hired-the-firm-recounting-azs-election-to-probe-a-pa-election](https://azmirror.com/2021/05/24/group-led-by-kraken-lawyer-sidney-powell-hired-the-firm-recounting-azs-election-to-probe-a-pa-election/)/. Powell later pleaded guilty to charges related to the Coffee County, Georgia election security breach: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/19/sidney-powell-guilty-plea-trump-georgia-elections. These election security breaches matter because of JUST HOW VULNERABLE they made the 2024 U.S. Election, and how vulnerable they make all future U.S. elections that are run using compromised machinery.

IN SUM: 1. Equipment that counts approx. 70% of America's votes was subject to a massive security breach after the 2020 U.S. election. 2. Bad actors had access to sensitive election software and machinery for over three years before the 2024 U.S. election. 3. This story has serious implications for U.S. election security and has never received the national attention it deserves. 4. All future U.S. elections MUST be hand counted prior to certification to ensure voter confidence in the results.

I might have the opportunity to work a 7-3 shift at a location and want to know if it makes a difference. What is it like at your job? Are you easily able to request days off? Do you like your benefits? I currently work a closing shift at a coffee shop and other then the shitty hours I feel like me being days off is always an issue. Even though I dont even do it often. But before i even think about switching jobs in today's economy I want to see what ppl think about the company. ,3,1755484410.0,durham,4,0.8,False

⸻

The Office – “The Coffee Wars”

COLD OPEN:
(Break room. Kevin is pouring himself coffee from the communal pot. Stanley walks in with a travel mug from Dunkin’.)

Kevin: (sniffs Stanley’s mug) Wait… is that not our coffee?

Stanley: (flatly) Life is too short to drink Dunder Mifflin coffee.

Kevin: (confused, holding his cup) …It’s free.

(Stanley walks out. Kevin looks at the camera, then dumps his coffee in the sink.)

TITLE SEQUENCE

⸻

ACT ONE

Michael’s Office.
Michael is holding a mug labeled “World’s Best Boss,” pacing.

Michael: (to camera) We are in the middle of a caffeine crisis. People keep going to Starbucks, Dunkin’, McDonald’s, even Sheetz—yes, Sheetz, like gas station coffee— instead of enjoying the beautiful brown lifeblood that we brew here. As Regional Manager, it is my duty… no, my honor… to fix this.

(Cut to Jim smirking in the bullpen.)

Jim: Michael’s starting what he’s calling “The Coffee Wars.” Which basically means he’s about to make things much, much worse. (beat) Which is kind of his thing.

⸻

Break Room.
Dwight has set up a French press, bags of beans, and a portable grinder.

Dwight: (intense) Our ancestors ground their beans with stone. They brewed coffee so strong it could double as paint thinner. Today we return to tradition.

Angela: (grimacing) That grinder is louder than your beet farm stories.

Pam: (to Jim) We should probably just let them… fight it out.

Jim: (to camera) There hasn’t been this much tension since the Great Bagel Friday Mutiny of 2008.

⸻

ACT TWO

Michael gathers the office in the conference room.

Michael: Today, we vote. Starbucks? Dunkin’? Our coffee? (holds up mug) Democracy in action.

Creed: (raising hand) I vote for whatever’s cheapest. Or free. Or stolen.

Oscar: Michael, we could just get a Keurig machine.

Michael: (gasps, horrified) That’s like saying we should replace all our friends with robots! Which is basically what Oscar wants. (points dramatically) Robot overlords.

⸻

Cutaway – Dwight
Dwight: A Keurig is basically Skynet in a box. Next thing you know, your toaster is your boss. (leans closer) Which, frankly, I’d respect more than Jim.

⸻

Later. Pam is at reception. Jim sneaks up with two mugs—one Michael’s office coffee, one Starbucks.

Jim: (whispering) Okay, blind taste test.

Pam: (sips one, makes a face) Ugh. Okay, that’s the office coffee.

Jim: (smiles) Nope. That’s Starbucks.

Pam: (freezes, horrified) Oh no…

(Jim looks at the camera, smirking.)

⸻

ACT THREE

Conference Room – Final Showdown.
Michael has set up three “coffee stations” labeled:
	1.	Michael’s Special Brew
	2.	Dwight’s German Combat Coffee
	3.	Starbucks

Michael: (dramatic) One of these coffees will reign supreme.

(Everyone sips. Stanley gets up and leaves without saying a word.)

Kelly: (after tasting Dwight’s coffee) Oh my God, this tastes like… like dirt had a baby with fire.

Dwight: (beaming) Thank you.

Kevin: (drinking Michael’s) Mmm. Tastes like water. But brown.

Michael: That’s called subtlety, Kevin.

(Jim and Pam exchange a look. Jim shrugs to the camera.)

⸻

TAG:
(Kevin is alone in the break room. He opens his desk drawer, revealing a hidden stash of McDonald’s coffee cups. He winks at the camera before sipping happily.)
