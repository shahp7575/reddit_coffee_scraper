As I am working in office 5 days a week, she's mostly alone at home the entire day and I feel like she is getting depressed and lonely (my father passed away when I very young). She does hang out with my aunt who is also retired throughout the week for coffee and chats, but I'm thinking if there's any regular activities that I can help enrol her in so that she can make more friends and be more mentally engaged.

She doesn't drive.

Am thinking of something along the lines of like regular morning exercise or meetups with other elderly folks at community centre, or perhaps skills-future courses that can keep her engaged.

Appreciate any advice!",2,1734797076.0,askSingapore,2,1.0,False

About a week and a half ago I had something of a spiritual awakening (full post on my profile).

In this awakening, I (22M) started giving less fucks about what others thought about me, this has been great.

I've noticed that instead of chasing women, I attract them now. (Someone asked me to dinner and after i flirted with someone she's like wow your great we should do something sometime).

This, obviously, is great.

But I still feel scared to approach a random girl like hey i think your great and id like to get to know you better over coffee(????)

I realy just want to start my journey in dating, ive never been in a serious relationship and am a little over 8 months sober.

The girls I seem to attract are just looking for sex OR want to keep me around as a friend (because tbh i am *actually* a great friend).

I just want to shower a woman with love and affection, but i dont want to do it with a woman who i dont appreciate like that (obviously).

Question being, how do i start my journey into the dating scene?

Any and all advice is appreciated,

My body’s need for sleep when I’m depressed is getting out of control. Nothing helps. Not my ADHD meds, not coffee, not forcing myself to walk. 

I fell asleep at my work desk yesterday.

1hjcsvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hjcsvy/am_i_delusional_or_does_he_like_me/,Am I delusional or does he like me?,"So I met this guy I work with a little over 6 months ago. He’s super kind, we get along really well, and I’ve developed a little crush on him. He’s 34 and I’m 23 if that makes any difference. I didn’t think about him in that way until I noticed we had a lot in common and how easy it was to talk to him. Then my mind wondered and you get the rest. We’ve gotten semi close over the past few months. He’s bought things I’ve mentioned liking in the store that we work at, he makes sure we always have this protein coffee drink stocked up, he’s told me a few personal things, I’ve occasionally pick him up/drop him off, and we take our breaks together. I will admit he isn’t just nice to me, he’s very chatty and respectful of everyone. He recently started getting closer to another coworker of ours, they take lunch together although it isn’t just the two of them it’s a few coworkers, they chat a lot, and he’s extra “protective” of her when another one of our coworkers gets flirty with her. Which leads me to believe that maybe he’s just A, a really nice person which attracts people, and B, may come off as flirting which is why I’ve thought all this time he was but now I’m questioning myself. I’ve dug quite the hole into this but I wanted outside opinions. Should I just let it go? Or maybe tell him how I feel? ",1,1734797036.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1hjcsk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1hjcsk4/two_weeks_on_zepbound_update/,Two Weeks on Zepbound – Update!,"Hey everyone! I thought I’d give a little update now that I’m two weeks into Zepbound. It took me a solid month of insurance rodeos (declined) and then calling Zep to swap my home phone for my cell (because the SMS wasn't going through), but we finally got the party started with the savings card!

Since I was itching to get back on track and lose *something* while waiting, I jumped back into 16:8 intermittent fasting. By the time I started Zep, I’d already **lost 12.4 lbs on IF** – my **starting weight was** **390.2 lbs**. When **Zep kicked off I was at 377.8 lbs**. After that, I dropped **5.7 lbs the first week** and **4.6 lbs the second**. That brings me to **-10.3 on Zep and -22.7 overall**. Not too shabby.

On the workout front:

* I’ve been doing 2-3 walks a week (30 min) for a few months now, but last week I kicked it up a notch. This past week, I’ve added some longer walks adding some much needed distance and endurance time.
* Last week I also started hitting my Tonal for 40-50 min of weight training 3x a week. That means I'm up to **3 strength sessions + 2 long walks/week**. I'm hoping that’s the sweet spot with a full-time job, three kids, and you know... life. Gotta set it up for success, right?

How I’m feeling:

* A few small waves of nausea, maybe 4-5 minutes every other day, but nothing that knocks me out or holds me back.
* *Coffee cravings?* Apparently Zep thinks I need less caffeine. I’m down from **4-6 cups/day to 2-3**. Who even am I? I love coffee, but the cravings just aren’t there like before.
* Food noise was never a big thing for me before I started Zep, but I’ve noticed I care *way less* about eating out or snacking now. I eat during my 8 hours not fasting, but a little goes a long way now. **Eating like a bird** isn’t my usual vibe, but here we are!

That’s the gist two weeks in! If anyone’s curious about anything random, feel free to ask. Happy to share! I’ve got a long ways to go but I’m excited about the journey.",1,1734797010.0,Zepbound,0,1.0,False

I’ve had lots of cars in my life, but this is the best one I’ve ever had hands down. I can’t wait to drive it each day. I make excuses to go out. I go get a coffee and then drive around for 20 minutes just because. I’ve never experienced this with any other car I’ve owned. I feel so lucky to have found out about this model in time to grab one and enjoy it for the next probably 10 years or more. 

I got 50mpg last night from driving surface streets checking out Christmas lights on pure EV, and then drove home in 25-45mph zones. I got 45.5 just driving home from the store in the next town over on mixed city/highway. I’m so impressed. I pretty much always use the advanced cruise control unless it’s heavier city traffic. 

Is there like a venza owners anonymous? I’m pretty sure I’m addicted! My husband is so sick of hearing about my damn car so I figured I’d share here 🤣

I am planning to follow this recipe for the cake: [Traditional Sponge Cake Recipe - Onya MagazineOnya Magazine](https://www.onyamagazine.com/lifestyle/food-drink/recipes/food-traditional-sponge-cake-recipe/)

I need advice about the filling though because I want to personalize it according to his taste. I had something in mind but I am looking for approval and other recommendations and creative ideas.

So I had in mind to moist it with a coffee liqueur mixed with a simple sugar  syrup. as for the filling and frosting, I want to make a light chocolate ganache, not a rich one, I want something that would come out like a cream with a chocolate taste. So I was thinking to use 200g of chocolate and 250g of heavy cream, add to it ground hazelnut and espresso powder.  
Alternative: use lychee compote for the moisting and additionally decorate it with the fruit, but not sure if lychee taste would go with such cream? anything I can do better?  
Would you put the cream just on the top of the 2 cakes or also on the sides?

I am also planning to add writings with a chocolate alphabet, in case that matters in anything.

The problem with the homemade cakes that they never come as fluffy and light like the one bought from outside, not sure what can I be doing wrong, also no matter how well you moist them they're kinda dry.

We’ve been dating for three years and have minor differences that I’ve decided won’t be compatible on my end if we continue long term. Overall he’s a great person and I think that’s what’s making this so hard for me. 

He recently took me on a trip for Christmas that was expensive. I wanted to end the relationship before then but had too much guilt as the trip was non refundable. I have Christmas gifts for him that I haven’t given him yet. I saw his mom last night and gave her the gifts I had bought her.

 He’s been going out of his way to do nice things for me lately which is only amplifying my guilt (randomly sending me money this morning to get myself coffee as a treat). 

I have so much guilt with the idea of breaking up with him before the holiday. I would have to do it the 23rd as our work schedules conflict up till then. I feel as though if I continue the relationship just to get through the holiday I’m dragging him on. I also feel like if I do it two days before Christmas that I’m a terrible person.

Hey friends,  

I wanted to share another piece of my journey with sciatica. A while back, I posted about how **hip flexor stretches** helped me take my first steps toward recovery (you can check it out here: [My Hip Flexor Stretch Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sciatica/s/QOhlY3ge8b)). But today, I want to talk about an exercise that’s become a *daily staple* in my routine: **donkey kicks**.  

When I first started dealing with sciatica, I felt like my body was betraying me. Every movement seemed to hurt, and I was constantly worried about making things worse. But as the pain began to centralize and I felt ready to rebuild some strength, I added donkey kicks to my routine—and they’ve been a game-changer.  

## Why Donkey Kicks?  
Donkey kicks target your glutes and core, two of the most important muscle groups for supporting your spine. Strengthening these muscles helps take pressure off the sciatic nerve and improves your overall posture. For me, this exercise also brought something I desperately needed: a sense of control.  

Every day, I’d carve out a little time to do donkey kicks, and over time, they became less of a chore and more of a habit. Knowing I was doing something proactive for my recovery gave me hope, even on the tough days.  

## My Daily Routine with Donkey Kicks  
Here’s how I worked them into my day:  
1. **Warm-up first:** I always spend a few minutes stretching or walking to loosen up.  
2. **Focus on form:** I make sure my back stays flat and my core stays engaged during every rep.  
3. **Start slow:** Even now, I don’t rush through them. Each movement is slow and controlled, focusing on quality over quantity.  
4. **Consistency:** Whether it’s first thing in the morning or part of my wind-down routine at night, I never skip a day.  

I started with just a few reps on each side and gradually built up. Now, they’re a natural part of my day, like brushing my teeth or making coffee.  

## The Results So Far  
Since making donkey kicks a daily habit, I’ve noticed a lot of small wins:  
- My posture feels stronger and more natural.  
- Walking doesn’t feel like such a struggle anymore.  
- I’m not as afraid to move, knowing my body is getting stronger.  

If you want to give them a try, here’s the video that helped me get started: [https://youtu.be/SJ1Xuz9D-ZQ?si=S7gJdcXdeB1BVx9S](https://youtu.be/SJ1Xuz9D-ZQ?si=S7gJdcXdeB1BVx9S).  

## What I’ve Learned Along the Way  
- Recovery is a process, and it’s not always linear. Don’t get discouraged by setbacks.  
- Adding one small, consistent habit—like donkey kicks—can make a big difference over time.  
- Pairing exercises like donkey kicks with stretches (like the hip flexor stretch I posted about earlier) can maximize your results.  

If you’re looking for something simple yet effective to add to your routine, give donkey kicks a shot. They’ve been a big part of my recovery, and I hope they can help you too.

Shota Aizawa trudged into the Class 1-A homeroom, pausing at the doorway to take in the students chatting, laughing, and making far too much noise for this early in the morning. It was too early. ""All of you, shut up,"" he said. Without waiting to see if they obeyed, he shuffled over to the teacher's desk, grabbed a stack of papers, and scanned them briefly before tossing them back down.

""Training grounds. Five minutes. Move,"" he ordered.

The students filed out in a rush, leaving the room blessedly silent. He dropped into his chair, rubbing his eyes with a groan. How had he gotten himself into this situation?

Oh, right. The open window.

It had been freezing that night, and the promise of warmth had been too good to resist. Maybe he could even find some coffee. He'd been living on the streets for weeks by then, running on empty in every way that mattered.

When Cementoss had caught him wandering around UA’s campus, he’d been sure it was over--arrested for trespassing, maybe worse. But instead, the man had looked him over and asked, ""You’re the new faculty member, Eraser Head, right?""

Back story: after 30 years of marriage I asked my verbally explosive, emotionally abusive husband to move out last spring. I wanted him to leave, but he was my person and best friend for decades, with the 1% of his behaviour poisoning the 99%.

I haven't seen him in a while and needed to hand him over some papers and items today, so we met for a coffee, and he dropped his holiday plans, which include a city break with a woman he met online, and a heads up I'm about to receive divorce papers. It's ridiculous that I feel like this, but in the moment i felt like a bomb had landed in my lap, while he merrily moved onto the next topic (he has verbal diarrhea and no filter).

I already planned on a trip out with my kids tonight, to look at a light show, but I feel so sad. I need to hide it from then (they hate him, but are all over 18 so it's up to them how they relate to him, I am trying to separate our relationship and their relationship).

""D'you know how I got into coffee?"" Valyria asked.

Jing stood next to her, rinsing dishes and loading up the dishwasher. ""No"", she replied. ""You never shared that story with me.""

""I got my first taste forty summers ago,"" Valyria said, a far-off look in her eyes. ""One of the knights who'd come to kill me had this giant thermos, one of those really well-insulated ones, you know. I took just one sip, and I was a goner.""

Jing's ears twitched with amusement. ""And you're still a goner,"" she quipped. ""I don't think I've seen you go a day without your morning cup.""

""Oh, hush up and listen to the story,"" Valyria chided, but she couldn't help smiling at the well-natured joke. ""In those days, I was Valyria of the Golden Flame. I was unstoppable. Robusta, arabica, liberica, and excelsa...I traveled all across the world, collecting different varietals and recipes. I stockpiled them all, hoarding them for myself. And I conducted experiments. Brewing techniques, different types of milk and honey, cross-breeding plants - when you're a dragon, you have plenty of time to reach perfection. Until one day, I did.""

She inhaled deeply, savoring the rich aroma that permeated their store, *Cockatrices and Cappuccinos*. It was the smell of a new of strain of bean, evenly roasted by dragonfire, finely ground into powder, then brewed with the perfect ratio of water to coffee. ""I dubbed my new creation the *wyverna* bean, and for a while, I was very happy.""

Jing smirked. ""Now, this part of the story is one that I'm familiar with.""

Valyria rolled her eyes good-naturedly. ""Let me talk, won't you?"" She took a sip from her mug on the counter before continuing on. ""I felt that something was missing. The coffee was great; maybe even perfect, but after a while, the hole inside me grew and grew. And then you showed up. Barely an adult, a fox-spirit who'd been forced out of her home.""

""I was so desperate for shelter that I was ready to walk into a dragon's lair,"" Jing reminisced. ""And the first thing you did was offer me a cup of coffee."" The heat from the caffe mocha had gone straight to Jing's chilled heart, reminding her of the hot chocolate her mother used to make for her during the long cold winter nights. She'd burst into tears.

""And then you started sobbing!"" Valyria tsk'ed. ""I was so terrified. Was the coffee really so horrible? Were my tastes truly so unrefined?""

Jing stuck out a tongue. ""Well, *after* my crying breakdown, I told you how good it was. And I told you that you ought to open a cafe.""

""That's when it hit me,"" Valyria nodded. ""Coffee isn't meant to be hoarded - it's meant to be *shared*. We opened *Cockatrices and Cappuccinos* the very next month, and the rest is history.""",4,1734794404.0,theBasiliskWrites,0,1.0,False

1hjbskr,https://www.reddit.com/r/petsitting/comments/1hjbskr/thoughts_on_returning_a_dog_halfway_through_the/,thoughts on returning a dog halfway through the job?,"Hi! This is both a vent rant and a plead for advice since I’m genuinely losing it…

My uni friend was going out of town for christmas, so I offered to look after his dachshund. I’m supposed to take care of his dog for a 8 days, and he’s paying me 80 usd. I know this is pretty low, but I honestly didn’t mind since it’s a small dog, and I was available anyways. I live with my brother and two dogs in an apartment, and both my dogs are super chill and manageable to the point I was able to easily take care of both of them on my own when my brother was abroad for a month, so I definitely thought I could take care of this dog since my brother’s home and willing to help. We had it set up so that my brother would primarily focus on our dogs, while I would focus on my friend’s dog.

The issue is that even without my two dogs (who stay in my brother’s room majority of the time), this dog is super chaotic and is just too much for me to handle… I was told he’d go outside to potty, but he’s peed multiple times indoors. In a span of three days, he’s peed twice on our dining table, four times on the coffee table, twice on our hallway mirror, once on our shoerack, twice on my yoga mat that’s rolled up and standing in a corner, once on my bathroom mat, and twice on my dog’s beds. He has also just jumped onto the couch solely to pee on my hoodie and on the cushions. 

I was fine with it at first since it is a new environment and I know that can affect dogs that way, but even when I keep an eye on him, he doesn’t do any signal that he needs to go his business. He doesn’t have any indication of when he needs to go; he just struts up to my furniture and pisses without abandon. I turn around for a minute and he’s already peed on something. I can’t even clean his pee without him pissing on something else. I’ve resorted to taking him on walks every hour or so, but he seems to reserve some pee just to make sure he can piss on another piece of furniture once we’re back inside. He also does this weird thing in which he bites his own genitals and releases… fluids… on my couch blankets. I’ve tried stopping him, but he gets angry with me and snaps at my hand.

Additionally, he barks and growls at strangers on walks, and he’s even lunged and snapped at a passerby. He’s also chewed up my slippers while I was in the shower, destroyed my dogs’ toys, grabbed my crochet project from the coffee table and chewed on it when I was doing the dishes. He nips at my hands and feet when I refuse to let him chew on things, and he’s also been sexually harassing my senior dog when I let them stay in the living room together (hence why she’s almost permanently in my brother’s room). He also stays up till 2 in the morning shuffling about, and I stay up to watch him till he eventually goes to bed, but then he wakes up at 6 in the morning and starts demanding to be let out of my room, to which I let him out because I don’t want him peeing on my things again. I can’t even go back to sleep since I have to take him on his hourly walk.

I’m supposed to take care of him for five more days, and I genuinely don’t think I can do it. I’m constantly hovering over this dog to make sure he doesn’t make another mess, and I can’t do anything else. I can’t get anything done as I’m constantly having to put everything down to stop him from peeing somewhere, or to take him on his walks. 

Anyways, I’m just incapable of taking care of him, and was wondering what the general consensus is of like. returning a dog halfway through a pet sitting gig? Should I just stick it out till my friend’s back? I feel horrible since I did promise to look after him, and I was paid for this, and that my friend will have to find someone else while he’s across the country, but I genuinely cannot deal with his dog anymore. I’ll definitely return the money and everything too.

1hjbm5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hjbm5u/theres_someone_standing_in_front_of_my_house/,There's someone standing in front of my house every night.,"I'm not a celebrity or a high-ranking person for someone to stalk me. Heck, I'm not even a social media person, but I do have an account actually though I barely use it. So what happened the past month terrified me, that just reminiscing about it send chills to me. I'm using my account to get this nightmare off my chest, and spread awareness also. If you've encountered the same events, know that you're not alone here.

It actually started back in August. I was reading a novel on my bed to spare time. It was 10:34 that night and the blackness of the night can't seem to tire my body down. Drinking coffee before bed wasn't a good idea, but the ambiance of the night needs a hot coffee to compliment it. For what seem like a long hour, enough time had passed already. And the evening breeze is getting slightly stronger, creating sounds of trees and branches shaking. This is the indication that I should sleep already. I stood up, make my way into the small drawer beside the window when a figure outside caught my eye. At first, I thought it was an animal but as I got closer to the window to examine it, it's certainly a person. It was standing just beside the tree, not near enough but also not far. A sudden chill electrified me. Seriously, the idea of someone standing outside your house looking at you at night is terrifying. The person was not moving but I'm certain that it was staring at me. I can't discern who it was as the shade of the tree is making it hard to look. So that night, I immediately cover the windows and went straight to bed. Checking who it was in the midst of the night is something I'm super terrified of. Maybe it was just one of the neighbors pulling a prank or something.

The next day, everything went normal. What happened that night still bothered me but not to an extent where it gets me so paranoid about. Then the night came. I wasn't doing my usual night routine because a distant friend of mine called. We talked about what kind of lives we are living since we graduated from college, since we haven't been connected for years. After an hour of endless stories, we bid our goodbyes and the call ended. It was 11:47 and I went to my room. As I was fixing my bed, the window tempted me to look from it. I was curious if the person was there and the dormant fear suddenly erupted within me. But I wanted to be assured. As my eyes scanned outside, I couldn't see the person standing beside the tree. A sudden relief washed me. Maybe it was a prank all along. I leaned back from the window to finally get to bed when my heart suddenly pounded as my eyes caught something familiar. I looked again, but this time, slowly. To my utter shock, the person was there but more closer. Closer enough to reveal that it is a man. At first glance, I couldn't see the man because my eyes were focused on the tree but little did I know, it gotten closer. He was standing next to my rose garden, just blankly staring at me. I immediately turn on the lights and ran to the living room out of terror. I just know, I never slept that night.

On the third day, the effects of being awake all night struck me. My movements were a little bit heavy but I still got to work. Then the night falls again, and the same nightmare began but more intense than the previous ones. The man was getting nearer each night because this time, he was right outside my window, just ten steps ahead from the rose garden. This time, the man was looking up, staring at me. He doesn't move, he's just there stagnantly staring, examining me. That was my last straw. With shaking fingers, I immediately dialed 911. The police was certainly coming and this hell would be over. After a long hour of waiting, they did came but the man was gone. The police searched the area but they couldn't find the man. But they did see a single pair of footsteps right on the position of the man that stood there. What's puzzling is that there's no other footsteps leading up to it because the ground around the single pair of footsteps was untouched. It's like the man magically appeared there and disappeared. The thought of it intensely terrified me. The police told me to watch out for any signs of the man appearing again and notify them.

On the fourth day, It was a day where I woke up in a different room. Yes, I did booked a hotel that night because I couldn't stay in that house any longer after what just had transpired. The mornings are my safe zone, so I go to my house to suit myself up for work. The single pair of footsteps still lingered and I couldn't stare at it for too long. The night came and I decided to stay at home, because I had to notify the police if the man showed up again for this to be over. I just had to bear my fear. My eyes were focused on the way to my room as I was walking, avoiding peeking at any sides. I slowly opened the door of my room, with my eyes till looking straight into the bed. When I entered, the intense fear was creeping upon me.

The bed.

The pictures on the wall.

The corner of the room.

And then, the window.

The fear instantly paralyzed me. Unable to move, even to run as my gaze was chained to what I saw in the window. The man was right in front of it, just the glass dividing us. I couldn't comprehend how the man was literally in front of my window as there's no roof or a platform that can make him stand there. The realization of it all layered my trembling body. He was floating. I didn't waste any second, I immediately got out of my room shaking, then ran towards the backdoor to escape the monstrosity. I hit the road and sweared to never come back again.

And still, to this present day, that moment still haunts me.",1,1734793530.0,nosleep,0,0.66,False

In concept, I really like that idea but I haven’t really been able to make it work in practice. 

Most of my writing is academic and related to history. I use a lot of books for reference, but I also use journal articles that are saved as PDFs, websites, etc. My habit is to save everything I find. For example, if I find a webpage, I make a copy of that page, usually in the form of a PDF and save it to a folder. That way I can access it offline and if the webpage goes down, I still have a copy of it. With that leg work done, in theory, I can access those resources working in OS 9.

While I write, I often find myself using the internet to look up things that come to mind as I write, verify things, look up words, etc. It seemed like MS Bookshelf could actually fill that need to an extent. However, Bookshelf is a clunky product. Accessing it while writing is a pain! Perhaps, I need to work on a larger screen or with two monitors to make it more usable. In all fairness, I like using dual monitors on my modern desktop while writing so I can view multiple open windows while working. This seems to eliminate a laptop for the purpose of distracting free writing. That kind of takes some of the fun out of it because I would love to set up at a coffee shop with a Pismo and work in OS 9!

(genuine question),"Hi all, I'm genuinely baffled by this. So I work 4-5 hours 5 days a week in a very physically intensive job (loading boxes up to 150 pounds at at a cardio-intensive rate) and I eat fairly clean. I weigh around 189 lbs for 5'6"" so I'm trying to lose weight. 

The thing I guess I'm confused about is that I've slowly been cleaning up my diet and switching to healthier foods, + not eating as much as I used to and I'm not losing weight. I don't track calories but I do track what I eat and I guess what's confusing is in my last job which was also physically intensive, I was eating horribly but losing weight. But this one is a lot more lifting, plus in the past month or so I'm eating less and eating healthier so I thought that would be a benefit. But I'm just not getting anywhere.

I'm trying to avoid calorie counting because I have a history of ED-related issues but I feel like the margin of error with the food I'm eating can't be THAT high. I usually eat 2-3 meals a day, usually a salad or for example sweet potatoes and chicken, that kind of thing. I'm a pretty repetitive eater AKA I eat the same kind of things, and I don't snack much and I write it down if I do. I don't drink calories except a coffee with milk.

I guess I just don't really know what to do except count calories, but I really want to avoid that. And I'm so physically active that I feel like even if I'm not counting calories but tracking my food and eating healthy then there should be some effect, right? Or am I crazy lol.

My only other thought is that I've gained a lot of muscle but like. Muscle doesn't weigh *that* much more and it'll eventually even out right? I really want to slim down and I feel like no matter what I do it's not coming along. I even weighed myself today and when last I was at 186, now I'm at 189. I just don't get it. I wonder if I should give it more time? I've been slowly improving my habits over the past year, but this month I've really kicked it into gear. Idk. Any thoughts would be helpful.

Sorry this turned into a kind of vent. I just gained a lot of weight when I went on T and I have bad cholesterol so it's really important for me to figure this out. And I used to lose weight easily, now I feel like nothing I do is working.",4,1734792694.0,FTMFitness,7,0.83,False

I love the product's physical quality.

I do not like the fact that I need to create an account and log in to an App to turn on, what is effectively, a heater. I don't really see any tantalizing use cases for this as a customer. I don't need historical on my coffee heat. I don't need remote heating. I'm uncertain but I suspect this isn't a common usage among the market base in general.

I suspect the reason for this is user data association and collection for both product quality and marketing. Fair enough; I'm not overly paranoid about this. It's inconvenient and I don't like it, but if it's a one time friction, I'll pay it up front.

**However**, it's proving to be a reoccurring cost when you force me to log back in every other week to turn a heater on for my coffee. The worst time to add customer friction is whenever they engage with your product. The second worst time to add customer friction is at 5am as they're reading their emails to prepare organizationally.

This is sufficient reoccuring annoyance to lead me to no longer recommend your products to my friends and family, and instead go on tangents about how every time I want to use it, I have to spend extra log logging in to an account. Imagine if you had to re-log in to an account to turn on your AC, Home Heater, adjust thermostat temperatures, flush the toilet, etc.

Suggestions:  
\* After initial registration. Don't require me to log in unless I need to perform an action that requires it, like a support request, hardware firmware updates, or something along these infrequent lines.  
\* After initial registration, don't require a log in to turn my mug warmer on. If this is due to wanting to collect analytics and needing another authorization token, find another way.",1,1734792415.0,Ember,1,1.0,False

I'm 24 year old and looking for someone who’s interested in a simple, no-pressure coffee date. I enjoy philosophy, blues and rock, programming and coffee.

If you’re someone who appreciates genuine connections and would like to grab a cup of coffee and chat about life, books, movies, or anything else, let’s make it happen!

I’m hoping to keep things casual and see where it goes—whether it’s a friendship, more coffee dates, or just a nice afternoon.

I'll be available on Bangalore from 02-01-2025 again. (I'm currently in my hometown with my family)

She said she was coming right back.,"I just found this sub. I’ve wanted to share her story so bad but I’ve had no where to bring this grief. No one truly understands until it happens. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD. If you know, you know (virtual hugs to everyone who knows). Apologies if this post is all over the place. My brain is still struggling to process what happened. 

It was a regular day. My best friend came over to drop her dog off at our house for that day. We babysat her dog all the time and she often slept over at our house (my partner & I called her our 3rd roommate). I went to work. My partner came home & mentioned her dog was still there well after she said she’d pick him up. I text her. She texts back she forgot, she has time blindness. Kind of unusual, but I chalk it up to her being exhausted from residency (she had just become a doctor!). I say no problem, just give me a heads up next time. I get home, BFF still hasn’t picked up dog. I text her. She responds back that she’s grabbing us dinner in the city. Weird, but ok. She eventually shows up to the house to pick up dog while my partner & I are taking a nap. I was exhausted that day after starting a new job & having an insomnia. I running on limited sleep so I didn’t notice right away that she was behaving unusually. She came upstairs to say hi before leaving. I was so out of it. It wasn’t until she sat on the edge of our bed that I knew something was up. I sat up & looked at her. She looked out of it, slurred speech. I could tell she was under the influence of something (not alcohol). She admitted she was having suicidal ideation. 

I wish I had called 911 then, but she told me if I did that it would be on her public record and they could take her medical license away. She had studied all those years & just finally became a doctor!! I believed her. I didn’t know! I really didn’t!! When she admitted to being suicidal, I instantly went into “how do I get her to the hospital?” mode. The thing is, BFF came from a very religious family. She was second generation American. Her family is always very concerned about outward appearances when it comes to their community and there is a strict hierarchy to how their family communicates. I knew I had to contact her eldest brother to help convince her to go to the hospital & to let her family be aware of the situation. But my BFF kept her family life & social life completely separate so I didn’t her family’s contact info. Her phone was dead & she was high off of what I suspect was Xanax. She did drugs recreationally, but not like this. But still, I didn’t know! My brain was still trying to process the situation & babysitting her was a full time job that night. She was all over the place. She was extremely giddy, laughing a lot. Cracking jokes. Smiling nonstop. She laughed when she told me she rode the train all day. I thought she had been at work. Again, I should have called 911 right then & there but I didn’t want to risk her medical license & I really never imagined what was to come. She had never expressed being suicidal before so I must have wanted to believe it was the drugs speaking. I tried to get her families contact info, but her phone was dead & she was playing keep away from me all night. She wouldn’t give me her passcode. She kept acting like the entire situation was a bad joke. I was getting confused. Was it the drugs speaking or was she actually suicidal? I thought that if I waited her out, if she got some sleep & sobered up she would realize what happened & go to the hospital with me and her brother. I told her she was sleeping over & not allowed to leave my house until we called her brother in the morning. She agreed, we had a plan. The plan was she would sober up & call her brother first thing in the morning. She didn’t want to call him in the middle of the night - not when she was high on who knows what. And plus her brother had a toddler & she didn’t want to wake him up. Why did I think that was reasonable?!? I convinced myself that as long as I kept my eyes on her until she sobered up, she would be fine. I comforted myself into believing it was just the drugs speaking & that she’d be back to normal in the morning. I tried to keep her entertained. We watched Jersey shore, ate snacks & hung out. I stayed up with her all night & kept my eyes on her well after she finally fell asleep. I felt like I was walking on eggshells. I didn’t know the passcode to her phone & every time I would get a hold of it she would wake up & take it from me. I tried looking up her eldest brother on fb but I couldn’t find anything. I didn’t even know her parents names! Again, she kept her family life & social life completely separate (which I believe she did for cultural reasons). Her family lives in a very tight knit, religious community where everybody knows each other. 

I question every second of that night. I wish I had truly understood the gravity of the situation. When she finally sobered up & slept a little, she agreed to call her brother & go to the hospital. I was beyond exhausted. She went to take her dog out & came back to ask if I wanted anything from Starbucks. She promised she’d be back, she was just going to call her other best friends (who share her culture) on her way to pick up coffee so she could get their advice on how to break the situation to her family. I believed her, like a fucking idiot. I watched her walk towards sbux from my window. At that point I was so exhausted, I fucking fell asleep. I FELL ASLEEP!! 

The call from her brother woke me up. I had missed the officer’s call. When her brother asked if I knew where she was & that the cops are looking for her, I immediately called 911. I was transferred to the detective who confirmed her death. 8 minutes after she had left my house, she jumped in front of a train. She left me her dog & a suitcase with some clothes in it. I’m the one who found the notes. She had left her car door unlocked & a notebook on the passenger side seat faced down. There were 2 notes. One to the family, one to me. 8hrs later, her close family, friends & I got a goodbye text from her. She had scheduled them to send after she left us. Because of her religion, her family refuses to share her true cause of death & asked me to keep it a secret so she can get into heaven. They’ve told everyone she passed away in a traffic accident. I had to surrender her dog, the love of her life, to a rescue to be rehomed since we couldn’t keep him. 

To say this has been hard is an understatement. Im a big believer that life gives you only a dozen soulmates. She was definitely one of mine. The grief is all consuming.

1hjb6t9,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1hjb6t9/saturday_morning_before_christmas/,[Saturday Morning Before Christmas],"The Smith household was a flurry of holiday cheer on that crisp Saturday morning before Christmas. Snow blanketed the ground outside, and the scent of pine and cinnamon filled the air inside. The Christmas tree stood proudly in the corner of the living room, its branches adorned with twinkling lights and mismatched ornaments, many of which had been made by Tyler and Caleb over the years.

Tyler was the first to wake up, as always. At fourteen, he wasn’t exactly a morning person, but the excitement of Christmas week was enough to pull him out of bed early. He stretched, yawning as he glanced over at Caleb’s bed.

The six-year-old was still snuggled under a heap of blankets, his mop of curly hair peeking out from the top. Tyler grinned. Caleb had been talking about Christmas nonstop for weeks, making lists for Santa and counting down the days with a paper chain they’d made together.

“Hey, sleepyhead,” Tyler whispered, gently nudging Caleb’s shoulder.

Caleb stirred, blinking groggily. “Is it Christmas yet?” he mumbled, his voice thick with sleep.

“Not yet,” Tyler said with a laugh. “But we can still have some fun today. Come on, let’s go make some hot chocolate.”

At the mention of hot chocolate, Caleb perked up, rubbing his eyes as he sat up. “With marshmallows?”

“Always,” Tyler said, ruffling Caleb’s hair.

The two brothers padded downstairs in their pajamas, the floorboards creaking softly beneath their feet. In the kitchen, they worked together to make their favorite holiday treat. Tyler heated the milk on the stove while Caleb carefully counted out marshmallows, piling them high in their mugs.

Once the hot chocolate was ready, they carried their steaming cups to the living room and plopped onto the couch. Tyler grabbed the remote and turned on a Christmas movie, the familiar opening notes of Home Alone filling the room.

As they sipped their drinks and watched Caleb's favorite cartoons, Caleb leaned against Tyler’s side, his small body warm and snug.

“Ty,” Caleb said suddenly, his voice thoughtful.

“Yeah, buddy?”

“Do you think Santa gets tired delivering all those presents?”

Tyler chuckled. “Probably,”

Caleb nodded, satisfied with the answer. “Do you think he’ll like the cookies we made?”

“Definitely. We made the best cookies on the block,” Tyler said confidently.

The morning passed in a blur of cozy moments. After the movie, they bundled up in their winter coats and headed outside to play in the snow. Tyler helped Caleb build a snowman, his little brother insisting on giving it a carrot nose and a lopsided scarf. They had a snowball fight that ended with both of them collapsing into the snow, laughing until their cheeks ached.

Back inside, their mom had set out the ingredients for gingerbread houses. Caleb’s house leaned precariously to one side, covered in an explosion of candy and frosting, while Tyler’s was more structured but just as colorful.

“That’s… creative,” Tyler teased, eyeing Caleb’s masterpiece.

“It’s a gingerbread castle,” Caleb declared proudly.

As the sun began to set, the brothers settled back onto the couch with their parents, the fireplace crackling softly in the background. They watched as the Christmas lights outside cast a warm glow on the snow-covered yard.

“Only two more sleeps until Christmas,” Caleb said, his eyes sparkling with anticipation.

Tyler smiled, wrapping an arm around his brother’s shoulders. “Yeah, and it’s going to be the best Christmas ever.”

Caleb looked up at him, his face full of trust and excitement. “Because we’re together?”

“Exactly,” Tyler said softly. “Because we’re together.”

The warmth of the moment filled the room, blending with the soft hum of holiday music and the promise of a magical Christmas to come.



**A Christmas Eve Promise**



The days leading up to Christmas flew by in a whirlwind of festive excitement. Caleb could hardly contain himself as Christmas Eve finally arrived. The Smith household was alive with activity—presents were carefully arranged under the tree, stockings hung over the fireplace, and the smell of sugar cookies baking in the oven filled the air.

Tyler and Caleb were inseparable that day, as they always were. They spent the morning helping their mom in the kitchen, Caleb sneaking a taste of cookie dough while Tyler pretended not to notice. In the afternoon, they played board games by the fire, Caleb giggling uncontrollably when Tyler lost a round of Candy Land.

As evening settled in, the family gathered for their favorite Christmas tradition—reading The Night Before Christmas. Caleb nestled under Tyler’s arm as their dad’s voice brought the story to life, his words soft and rhythmic.

When the story ended, Caleb looked up at Tyler with wide eyes. “Ty, do you think Santa’s already on his way?”

Tyler grinned. “He might be. But you know, he won’t come if we’re still awake.”

Caleb gasped. “We have to go to bed! Right now!” He scrambled off the couch, grabbing Tyler’s hand and dragging him upstairs.



**The Night Sky**



Later that night, as the rest of the house settled into a peaceful quiet, Caleb whispered from his bed. “Ty?”

Tyler rolled over, his eyes heavy with sleep. “What’s up, buddy?”

“Can we look for Santa?” Caleb asked, his voice a mix of excitement and wonder.

Tyler smiled. “Alright, but just for a little bit.”

The two brothers tiptoed to the window, their breath fogging the glass as they stared out into the snowy night. The sky was a blanket of stars, twinkling brightly, and Caleb’s eyes scanned the horizon eagerly.

“Do you see him?” Caleb whispered.

Tyler shook his head but pointed to a particularly bright star. “See that one? Maybe it’s Rudolph’s nose lighting the way.”

Caleb’s face lit up. “It has to be! He’s coming, Ty!”

They stayed at the window for a while, the quiet magic of the night wrapping around them. Finally, Caleb’s eyelids began to droop, and Tyler guided him back to bed.

“Ty?” Caleb murmured sleepily.

“Yeah?”

“I’m glad you’re my brother.”

Tyler felt a warmth in his chest, a feeling he’d grown familiar with ever since Caleb was born. “I’m glad you’re my brother too, Caleb. Now go to sleep, or Santa might skip our house.”

Caleb giggled softly and closed his eyes, drifting off with a smile on his face.



**Christmas Morning**



The next morning, Caleb woke up to the sound of bells—at least, that’s what he thought it was. He bolted out of bed and shook Tyler awake. “Ty! It’s Christmas! Santa came!”

Tyler groaned playfully, rubbing his eyes as Caleb tugged him out of bed. They raced downstairs to find the living room transformed. The tree sparkled with lights, and the presents beneath it seemed even more numerous than the night before.

Their parents were already there, sipping coffee and smiling at the boys’ excitement. “Merry Christmas!” their mom said, her voice full of warmth.

Caleb tore into his gifts with unrestrained glee, while Tyler opened his with a bit more care. One box caught his eye—a small package addressed to both of them. He handed it to Caleb, and they opened it together.

Inside was a handmade wooden ornament, carved with the words Brothers Forever. Tyler’s breath caught, and Caleb’s face lit up.

“It’s us!” Caleb exclaimed, holding it up to the light.

Their mom smiled softly. “We thought it was the perfect way to celebrate how much you two mean to each other.”

Tyler placed a hand on Caleb’s shoulder, smiling. “It’s perfect.”

As the day went on, filled with laughter, games, and far too much food, the ornament found its place on the tree, right in the center where it could catch the light.

That night, as Caleb fell asleep clutching his favorite new toy, Tyler sat by the tree, the glow of the lights reflecting in his eyes. He thought about how much Caleb had grown, how their bond had only deepened with time. No matter what the future held, Tyler knew one thing for certain—Caleb would always have him, just as he’d promised all those years ago.

And in the quiet stillness of the night, Tyler whispered to himself, “Brothers forever.”",1,1734792231.0,redditserials,1,1.0,False

1hjb5i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hjb5i8/orbis_alius_precursor_to_invasion/,Orbis Alius: Precursor To Invasion,"Chapter 1: Bursting the Bubble

To anyone listening, my name is Devin Johnson. We are being hunted by creatures that were made to infiltrate our race, but what’s coming is nothing short of world-ending. We need to eliminate them and close the breaches they’ve been opening across our world. I know all this sounds crazy. Perhaps it's out of the blue for some of you, but listen to my story before you write me off. What I will tell you might save your life and those important to you.

I’m assuming you've heard about the disappearances worldwide unless you’ve lived under a rock the past year. The earliest accounts originated in Russia near someplace called Dachnyye Istochniki. If you look it up on the internet, the location was removed from any search engine. Obviously, no one took it seriously, except the Russians. They declared martial law and a ceasefire with Ukraine when odd reports of abductions by mysterious people came in. Some of these reports include them flying away with their victims. That’s around the time the first video dropped. Problem was, well, it was dark. Pitch black. But you could still hear the screams. Many speculated they were added in, but the spatial audio and changes when the device was dropped were disturbingly realistic. Then unnatural howls drowned every other sound. They were unlike anything I’d ever imagined coming from animals or humans. If you listened closely, you could barely make out a man pleading for mercy. Russians living abroad said they lost all contact with anyone they knew 30 miles around the area.

Well, it wouldn’t be long until what happened there happened here.

I made two cups of coffee to force myself out the door. I drank one, taking the other in a thermal cup. I thought Ohio was bad in my youth, but global warming seemed to have forgotten this state, entirely. That being said, I actually didn’t mind. I had been living in Cincinnati after my contract with the Army when I decided to peace out for the second time. Now I'm a software developer that was finally approved to work from home. All, except for Mondays. Sadly, it was Monday. That meant attending a team meeting we could have done online because our company and my project manager thought face-to-face interactions were “healthy.” I’d normally agree, but considering my lazy team members did more tweeting than work, I really didn’t have anything I wanted to say that I could in a professional capacity.

I hated everything. The fake friendliness, pizza or group parties, and the “we’re family here” that implies I wanted another one. Truth be told, I should be grateful, but almost everyone seemed so fake. So lifeless. Everything felt like it was HR approved before it was spoken. No one could be offended or good luck when they let you go on the next set of lay-offs.

When I headed out the door, it was still fairly dark and snowing. With my coffee in one hand and my laptop bag over my shoulder, I pushed onward toward my glorious ride, an HR-V 2016. It may be a mom's car, but it lasted for what seemed like ages. Until that night.

I walked to my parking space to reach the door. Before I opened it, something brushed against my back. I immediately turned with a bit of my coffee flying out of my mug. There was nothing. I looked right, left, right again, then gave up to find shelter in the car. I immediately inserted my key, pressing the brake before turning it. My air was already on max from the last time driving it. Cold air bombarded my face just to revive my shivering. I became accustomed to warmer and humid climates during my time overseas. This winter was beautiful, at least until I left the confides of my small, cozy house. Just as I put the car into reverse, a weird noise came from the trees. It sounded like a howl of some kind, but raspy and freakishly weird. Then I saw something. It seemed like a mist, but I couldn’t tell. It didn’t matter. My house was locked and I didn’t have much to steal. I also had cameras installed at every corner around the house, with two more inside. If anyone snooped around, let alone broke in I’d have everything I needed to identify them. Unless they wore ski masks and acted quickly.

After overthinking and worrying, though, I decided to quickly run in and get my Glock 43 looked around, then jumped back in my war vehicle. I finally left my long gravel driveway and onto the road. It was odd, though. I still felt like I was being watched, but how? I was driving and there were no other cars around.

I had left early, as usual. It was an old habit and a hard to break even if I wanted to. But at least that meant I could relax when I arrived and make myself another cup of coffee. Funny, a friend of mine always told me my caffeine addiction would be the death of me. I’ve learned that there are far worse ways for one’s life to end. But that hadn’t crossed my mind yet. I parked close to the exits so I could be one of the first to leave the corporate office. It was just outside of the downtown area. Warm air embraced my body upon entering the front.

“Good morning,” I greeted the secretary before scanning in.

“Good morning, Dev.” She replied kindly.

I returned a smile and nod before heading to the elevator. The first thing that caught my attention were the balloons with prizes advertised on billboards. These weren't normal prizes, either. One sign said, “Party Tonight at Frank’s Family Home! Win up to $100,000. Earn $10,000 for showing you care for the WinTyme family!” I stopped, reread it, then read it another dozen or so times before I chuckled at the absurdity of the company’s CEO offering ten thousand dollars to EVERY single person who showed up. I knew there had to be a catch, but what was it? There’s no way anything this good would just be handed out. I know some people in my position are spoiled and have absolutely no concept of money, just buying a new car and iPhone every year. But I did. At least, I’d like to think so. And there’s no way our CEO would’ve done this out of the goodness of his heart. Two years ago was our best year and he laid off anyone with 15 years of work experience at the company.

I took the elevator up three floors and was excited to find even more weirdness that I didn’t understand. A sign hung from the ceiling with sloppy print, “Take off today if you sign up to come tonight.”

Okay, something was up. I suspected we were all getting laid off. There were outings here and there, but this was a full-on shutdown if I’d ever seen one. I muttered curses just thinking of applying for another job. Thankfully the house I bought was a fixer-upper or my money would run up dry faster than I could find work. Health insurance wasn’t a huge worry for me since I did have the VA to a small extent, but- fuck this shit.

Being early, there’s often just Russell from another team and Joyce, an older project manager who was far smarter than you’d assume. At least, more than I initially realized. She notices the dirtbags, the backstabbers, and the good workers, but doesn't give it away in her demeanor towards anyone. It wasn’t until she gave a bonus only to Russell. He was the only one who finished his work, taking on other tasks depending on how far behind the others were. The other team members talked like they were the smartest and hardest working people in the department, but I could see Gloria on her Twitter and Facebook anytime I passed her desk.

So those two weren’t a surprise to see here. What was a surprise, however, were the four women and three men in the big boss’s office. He was there, too, and I swore I could see watery eyes. Was he crying?

One woman's head turned sharply towards me with her eyes piercing into my own. I began to feel similar to how I had this morning. It would’ve triggered every alarm in my mind if she hadn’t formed a long smile, showing white teeth that seemed impossible for a normal person to have. Even her skin lacked blemishes, tan lines, or any other abnormalities. I forced a nob and then continued towards my desk. Before I sat down, my phone beeped. Once seated, I opened it.

Russell texted, “Frank had been crying before I arrived. See the 10,000-dollar prize for showing up to his party?”

Right now nothing made sense. An odd urge told me I’d be better off leaving, but I couldn’t. I needed a job and money. Hell, if they were going to lay us off, I’d want that 10k, assuming no stipulations were attached. If I had known.

“What are the chances we are all getting laid off?” I asked, then added, “most of us, at least.”

Though I was tempted to look over, I waited for his response, seeing he was already typing.

His next message had me puzzled, “Frank just told Joyce he brought on three new employees and wasn’t letting anyone go until next year. She said most teams aren’t in any position to lay members off, though I think a couple in mine wouldn’t be missed.”

I thought for a moment before responding, “But that doesn’t explain the money rewards and party.” I sent it right after the office door cracked.

Frank formed a big smile, but his eyes were still slightly red. “Mornin’, Dev! Today’s gonna be a great day!”

Bewildered and uncertain which of my dozen questions I should’ve asked first, I decided to nod and go straight to the point. Leaving out his crying of course. “Why the rewards celebration, Frank? Are we getting cut?”

I should've kept my mouth shut, but he chuckled, “No, not at all! We’re doing great and I’ve finally decided the best employees are the ones that feel valued.”

It took all my will power and focus to hold back a laugh. The odds of him being genuine were the same as playing the Mega Lottery. Something wasn’t right. Maybe I was being paranoid, but my gut told me that a man with three offices, a Yacht, and a Porsche would never do this. Hell, how could he afford to?

“I can see this seems a bit far-fetched to you,” he looked at me with concern.

“It just seems a little much,” I replied.

“How about I give you a check for the 10 thousand right now if you promise to come to the party tonight,” he replied with a hint of something uneasy.

For a moment, I pondered what made him seem anxious. Desperation? But why?

The thing is it didn't matter. I didn’t want a handout. All I wanted was to earn my money. Granted, it would’ve been nice to receive a large bonus no matter what, but it didn’t feel right. Just as I was about to say no, one of the women came over to his side. The same woman who smiled just a few minutes ago looked absolutely stunning. Almost unnaturally so. Her hair was an ash blonde with bright red lips. She was also tall. I don’t mean your normal tall woman that’s 5 foot 9, but taller than Frank. I’d once asked him how tall he was after he said he didn’t believe I was 5’11.

‘6 foot 3,’ he had told me. Not only was she at least a couple of inches taller, but somewhat muscular, too. I was beginning to feel like a dwarf below two giants.

“This must be-Dev, yes?” She replied in an accent I hadn’t heard before. Something absolutely alien to me, but I understood.

“You would be correct, Miss-?” I asked.

“Carmille,” she replied with a long smile. “I would like to invite you, as well. We’re going to be workin with you all and we should get to know one another. Th-Frank is happy to be you! He wants you all to be happy working together.

I nodded, “Okay, ya got me! I’ll be there tomorrow.” Both their smiles widened as more people began to enter. While Frank turned to the others, she winked at me.

Other people suspected the same things I had, but Frank tried to settle their concerns. Though me and Russell weren’t convinced, everyone else went home. All except us, until Frank insisted we leave in a nice manner unbecoming of him. Another woman talked to Russell before Frank kicked us out, but Joyce refused to talk to any of the new people. However, the most important people to socialize with for a good start would be the senior developers, engineers, and managers. Joyce hadn’t been approached more than once. Her years gave her extensive experience. I'd think they’d at least pretend they care, especially since the others went home.

Just to be clear, I had no intention of going, but I needed to get out. To put it frankly, I had almost no family, no date for almost a year, and spent most of my time doing more computer work. Though I lifted and ran almost daily, I was a hermit. That gave me the thought to call an old friend, who I explained the situation to.

“Yup! You’re all getting canned, Johnson! Hate to break it to you,” that wasn’t exactly the input I was looking for.

“Then who are these other people? How experienced are these models? Something doesn’t add up,” I replied.

“I don’t know man, but you said the woman winked. I know she tall, but who cares?”

“Easy for your 6’4 ass to say,” he laughed at my response.

“Treat yourself, man! What’s the worst that could happen,” his would come back to bite me in the ass soon enough, but I was unaware of just how large this problem was.

“Thanks! Hopefully, I’m just being paranoid, but if I am getting laid off, a night out might not be so bad.”

“See, just start filling out applications the next day when they break the news,” he said and I chuckled.

That afternoon I bought protein pasta, chicken, and rice. I also snagged some Trojans and wine. Who knows what would happen? There were other women I barely talked to, so I decided this was the time to break out of my bubble.

Give a bit of space.

Frank's home was marked by a huge gate with a long driveway. I’ll say it was anything but modest. Now my anxiety was stronger than ever, wondering what this was about. I was beginning to think we were going to be scammed, but that seemed a bit much. Despite my reservations, I drove to the house. The snow had melted, so there was no problem. I was one of the first ones, again. At least there was no trouble parking here. Strangely, I remember Frank having pictures of him and his family outside his house and I could’ve sworn this wasn’t it. Was this a wealthier CEO’s place he knew? There was an unreasonable amount of parking space, even for a wealthy family. Then again, it wouldn’t have been the first time a rich family bought far more than they needed.

Still gawking, I followed a man waving towards the left side near a large lot. Past the side was a pool with a diveboard, two boats, and a few cars. Nice of the owner to move his expensive stuff in the dirt. I had to be overthinking this whole thing.

So I relaxed, let the man guide me back, and parked my car. I smiled and waved and he returned the gesture. He appeared to be anxious, but it wasn’t a big deal.

After leaving putting on only my favorite cologne and combing my hair, I passed a few strangers and entered the house. My first order of business was to drink something to calm my nerves. Second was to look for people I knew, especially Russell, Joyce, or Mac. Mac didn’t come to the office much, but he was a solid guy. Also, a Marine that I could shit talk with.

I had found wine, cheese of all assortments, and delicious steak bites that I’d happily helped myself to. If this was my last day on the job, I was going to get everything I could. You might say, “You’re not working,” but I’d argue that anytime I have to see the faces of my coworkers is me working. Excluding the previously mentioned. Funny enough, I couldn’t even see the tall blonde from earlier. Just as I was about to message Russell and Mac, a young redhead approached me, smiling. Her stare almost pierced my soul with green eyes. Eyes that I would’ve sworn transformed to slits for a moment.

“Hello! I have not met you, yet. Dev, is it?” She asked in a nice, but odd tone. She also had the same accent as Carmille. Not Slavic, Italian, Romanian, or Japanese. I’d heard quite a few in my thirty years and this seemed truly foreign to me. Almost alien.

“Carmille told you?” I asked.

“Yes! Yes, she did!” she reached her hand out, “call me Lilith!”

I chuckled, taking her hand, “Lilith, I don’t suppose you know what this is all about?”

“About what?” she asked giving me a confused look.

“This party and, well, everything. It’s not usual. At least, I’ve never seen a CEO invite his employees, and offer a 10K bonus while providing wine, steak, and cheese,” I remembered just how insane this all was, making me reconsider staying here. At the very least I decided to stop indulging in the wine.

“I don’t know. Carmille invited me, though I was playing Road of Exiles and watching corgi videos before I arrived here,” she said.

“One, Corgis are adorable and I want a couple. Two, I just started playing it again. Early access comes out this coming month.”

“I would love to play it sometime. Maybe you could make me a better player,” her words made me question so much. Was she implying what I thought she was?

After some more chatting, she gave me a number. The reason I say it’s a number instead of her number is because it wasn’t a real number. 666-1289. When I asked if the area code was the same as the area, she seemed confused, but eventually answered with a yes.

More and more guests piled in. Only a handful, however, were from my job. I asked a woman where her friends worked and she asked if I was invited, like I was a weirdo. All I wanted to do was to get an idea of where everyone was coming from, but I gave up. When I looked for someone I actually wanted to talk to, I noticed the stares of other tall and oddly perfect people. They are what I imagined an android to look like. One moment they’d converse with the guests, the next they’d scan the crowd like a cat would a field of mice. One of them licked his lips standing behind a decent-looking fellow that struck me as a sales and business guy. I turned to look behind me and there she was.

“Mr. Dev. How are you this evening?”

“I was just about to leave, to be honest, but nice to see you,” I lied out of my teeth.

By this time I had realized that there were two groups. Us and these strange people. I felt an urge to run. To leave this house, get in my car, and drive away.

“You can’t! The party is about to begin. Frank will be here any minute, now with your reward,” the way she said that felt inhuman.

“Okay. I’ll stay,” I replied.

Her grin became wide. Almost unnaturally so, “Good! I promise this will be an unforgettable night.”

I nodded with a smile, then turned around. I had absolutely no intention of staying. I just wanted her off my case. However, before I made it to the door, Russell flagged me down, possibly drawing attention I didn’t want.

“How’s the night, Dev?” he asked.

“Russell, something’s not right here. I think we should leave immediately.”

“I can’t! I met a woman and,” he turned his words to whispers, “I think I might be onto something.”

“Oh, yeah? You know her name?” I asked hoping it wasn’t one of the perfect people.

“Lilith,” he smiled. “She said she didn’t know anyone, so I introduced her to a few people, even the woman from this morning.”

My heart dropped. Everything seemed more wrong than ever, but I still couldn’t put my finger on what was about to happen. “Carmille,” I replied, slowly.

“Yep! That’s her name! I keep forgetting it,” he said. “She also loves cats and The Expanse of Space.”

“Russell. She told me she likes Corgis. I’ve been looking into getting one or two for the past week. You like cats. She’s also interested in things, I’m sorry, most women do not like. Also, there are others like her that look too,” I struggled to finish my sentence, but he noticed what I was saying.

“Perfect. Too perfect,” he replied. We looked at each other before looking towards the door.

“I still have my Glock in the car, Russell. Follow me to my car. I’ll drop you off next to your car then we can drive the fuck outta here,” I said and he nodded.

When we got to the exit, those men and women stared at us. Smiling. If you thought a McDonald’s employee's smile was fake, you haven’t seen anything yet. It creeped me out enough to pick up my pace. Russell followed my lead without hesitation. We exited into the night. Men began to trail us. I pulled my coworker to the right. As we picked up our pace, they did theirs. By the time we passed the first set of cars, we were power walking to my vehicle.

“Get in my car and I’ll get us out of here,” I told him.

“My car’s closer, Dev. I should just go to mine and you yours,” I didn’t like the idea of separating, but I didn’t have time to debate or think.

“Alright. Go!” I responded.

He began veering to the left, as did one of our pursuers. Then I noticed them. There were a dozen or so people surrounding the lot. And the house. Russell pressed the unlock button for his car, but the man sprinted towards Russell. That run was like no other I had ever seen. I wasn’t even sure if we had been running so much as gliding after a point. I didn’t bother to look behind me. I just ran, hoping to make it to my car in time. Then I panicked. I didn’t have a round in the chamber. I focused as I closed the distance to my car. The chasing footsteps behind me disappeared, and then a scream erupted.

“Help,” Russell cried.

I wanted to help, but I couldn’t stop. I slowed down just to grab the door handle. As soon as the door opened, I reached into my side seat and pulled the gun. I reached to remove the holster still attached, but the thing pulled me away. The thing’s face changed. Its teeth were now razor sharp.

“Where are you going, human?” After he finished taunting me, his mouth opened, darting towards my neck.

But not before I chambered a round and began firing. The first rounds were in the chest. The last four rounds were placed in his skull while I pushed my gun from under his head. Though he dropped to the ground, his chest wounds were healing. At that point, I was shivering and my nerves were firing on all cylinders as I struggled to get inside my car. That’s when all the creatures began to converge. My foot hit the brake then I turned the key. As I put my car in reverse, I reached into my glove compartment for another magazine, preferably the one with ten rounds.

My car tilted and grazed a few others in my attempt to escape. Screams erupted from inside the mansion. Tears were flowing down my eyes. I couldn’t help them. I wanted to, but I couldn’t. That’s when one of those things ran into my car, causing it to spin before flipping in the air. I held onto my gun for dear life feeling it was my only chance of making it out alive. Everything after that became dark.

The first thing I remember from when I regained consciousness was a salty smell. One vaguely familiar. Once my eyes opened, I saw the reason for this extreme stench. It was blood. An arm in front of me. I felt sick. My body was already weak, but this was almost too much. I closed my eyes for a moment to help myself cope, processing the events that had transpired. I took a deep breath.

“Alas, he is awake,” I knew that voice all too well by now.

“Fuck you,” I said. Then I remembered hearing Russell scream, “Where’s Russell?”

“He was an appetizer before the feast,” she replied in a disgustingly seductive manner.

“So you’re just going to eat people?”

“What can we do? There’s got to be something-” I man pleaded, but was cut off quickly.

“Please! We will do anything to save ourselves. That’s what your leaders said. Just before we had lunch,” she said followed by the creatures laughing.

“Then why are we still alive?” a woman asked.

I don’t know why she asked that. Probably fear and panic, but I had no desire to find out. Unfortunately, none of us were that lucky.

“You shall be sent to our reality at midnight, darling. There, you’ll see absolute beauty!” she replied like a mad woman on a high.

I wasn’t restrained, but my glock was gone. I had no idea how I would escape. My mind began to race with all sorts of ideas. I couldn’t have imagined what awaited on the other side and if I had known, I would’ve fought tooth and nail against those creatures.

Another said something in another language. It fit their accents perfectly, but I swore it wasn’t a language made by humans.

“What the fuck are you? Aliens? Vampires?” I asked out of curiosity, but also to stall.

She chuckled and ignored my question, responding in the language.

Looking around me, I saw at least a few dozen people. Granted, evidence all around us said some met a grisly end, but they spared most of us. Though I hated the question a minute ago, I was beginning to wonder what they had blamed for us. Looking around I saw more blood, limbs, vomit, smashed furniture, and those vampires staring at us. Everything except a weapon. I just realized I killed one with rounds to the head. But he could’ve healed. Then again, bullets to the head make more sense than a stake to the heart. I wasn’t sure what I should use, but I could snag a piece of a wood table leg broken off. Then I saw a kitchen knife against my leg.

I realized looking around I couldn’t retrieve it just yet or one of those things would notice. Unfortunately, Carmille began a ritualistic chant, cutting her henchman’s throat before tossing it into a weird mist. It absorbs the creature, and then explodes everywhere. Some sort of particles fly outward, sending a dry warmth everywhere. A whole wall formed in front of us. When I noticed the vampires were looking at the portal, I grabbed the knife, and tucked it into my sleeve. People were being lifted on their feet before being dragged to the entrance.

Though I desperately didn’t want to go through, I waited for the right moment to strike, but it never came. One of them began pushing me forward and I didn’t know if I could take him, let alone the others. Once at the edge, my skin began to tingle in pain. I turned while pulling the knife, but one of them kicked me through.",0,1734792105.0,nosleep,1,0.5,False

I began feeling EXTREMELY cold and shakey. A lot more cold than usual, and I sat next to the radiator. It happens when I do long IF. 

18h: Had very very little coffee - feeling very energetic and euphoric, coldness has gone away. Mind racing, slightly hypomanic.

20h-24h: Calmed down, mind slowed down a little fatigued. Heart rate more elevated than my baseline, I take a benzodiazepine to sleep.

Keep in mind I went to a concert so that was a very exhausting endeavour.

Day 2

24h-now-37h: Feeling some hunger pangs, more hungry than yesterday, maybe because I’m at the airport surrounded by food and food smells.

In fact, when I go to doctors appointments, one of the key points brought up is that I don't go out and in my room all day and ""doesn't want to interact or go out"".

But my friend (me male, her female) who I have known since 2009 had always sent me hand written letters in the past at how nice it would be to hang out. It has always been an impossible fantasy. Well they moved in 2018 a few train rides from me so it can now be a reality.

Well now I am in a financial and close location place where that's 100% possible and I have been telling her how excited I am at hanging out and how awesome it would be and asked the last three years on summer and Christmas and assuring her that we can meet in a public coffee shop where it is safe and I'll get my own hotel in her town and not step foot in her apartment so it's all safe.

Yet she will tell me my excitement is ""sus"" and questions why I am feeling that way like it is creepy or something. She said ""I know we talked about hanging out in the past, but you're acting very very excited about this and it is sus"".... She politely said ""I'm flattered and honoured you asked, but I don't wanna seem ungrateful"" and basically rejected my offer.

So the Autistic guy that has spent his life being bullied for being unsocial and not out going, NOW genuinely shows signs of wanting to come out of his shell and hang out and do all this stuff and then I am shot down as being ""sus"" because of it.. You cannot win.. Then I went to a doctor appointment a few days ago where I was told to go sit at a park bench just to get out of the house.. when I have this even better idea to hangout with this friend which would be much better..

I am also aware that this friend isn't just some paranoid scared person, because she has met up with other male friends from an online game in the past (who even crashed on her sofa over night) and attends a big busy university in her busy capital city.  So it absolutely sucks to have genuine excitement about being out going, something out of character for me, and having it denied.

It sucks so bad... There's people in my life who'd have a heart attack if they saw me so eager and happy to want to pursue a social hang out and travel on trains independently as it is so out of character for me to be the one trying to push a social situation. It is usually support workers or doctors or bullies telling me that I spend too much time inside and don't wanna go out.

Oh and even worse.. She's the one who sent me hand written letters back when we were just pen pals about hanging out, she planted that idea and even told me when she was moving close to me that she'd like to hang out, so she planted the idea first and got my hopes up...",0,1734791727.0,aspergers,4,0.5,False

1. Where did I go wrong? My guess is too much flow aid or not enough ink, but I would love someone else's opinion on this.
2. Where do I go from here? I could repaint the whole thing. My other thought is to try another wash coat of the paint/water/soap mix and see what happens.

1hjat1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1hjat1b/chapter_00_worst_ever_fanfic/,Chapter 00: Worst ever fanfic,"Lucas Hayes was nineteen, perpetually sleep-deprived, and fluent in sarcasm. 

Life hadn’t exactly handed him a golden ticket. He was an orphan who’d bounced between foster homes before finally landing in a halfway-decent situation at twelve. 

He clawed his way through school on sheer determination and scholarships, surviving mostly on ramen, caffeine, and an unshakable belief that fiction was better than reality.

He wasn’t bitter, though. Well, maybe a little. 

But when you grow up without a family, you learn to find comfort where you can. 

For Lucas, that comfort was the Wizarding World. He loved everything about it: the magic, the friendships, the feeling that even when things were dark, there was always a glimmer of hope. 

Harry Potter was the kind of character he could relate to: someone who faced the world alone but found a way to survive.

But with great fandom came great frustration.

Nothing annoyed Lucas more than bad fanfiction. He could tolerate weird pairings, cheesy plots, and grammar, so bad it needed an exorcism. 

But there was one story that haunted him like a poltergeist with a personal vendetta: “The Ophelia Chronicles”.

The premise? Harry Potter had a twin sister named Ophelia Lillian Potter. 

But instead of sharing his cupboard-under-the-stairs misery, she was adored by the Dursleys. 

When Dudley turned nine, Ophelia ran away, got adopted by Lucius Malfoy's brother , who apparently was just as rich, just as evil, but twice as willing to adopt random orphans. Because why not? Logic was for losers.

And she somehow became the dark magic queen of the universe. She was perfect, powerful, and about as likeable as a mosquito at 2 a.m.

She even married Draco Malfoy—her cousin, because genetics clearly took a vacation in this story.

Lucas hayes hated it. Not just because it was bad, but because it felt like an insult to everything he loved about Harry Potter.

The fandom community agreed. “The Ophelia Chronicles” was so infamous that mentioning it in a forum was like invoking Voldemort’s name.

One particular Friday night, after a brutal week of pretending to care about college assignments, Luca was in his dorm room, sprawled across his unmade bed. 

A half-eaten pizza languished on his desk, next to a stack of textbooks he’d heroically ignored all week. He scrolled through his favorite Harry Potter forum, looking for some mindless entertainment.

The thread title caught his eye: “Fanfic Disasters Hall of Fame”.

He snorted. This oughta be good.

WizardSlayer1994: Remember that fic where Harry turned into a giant squid and dated the Whomping Willow?

MagicMike27: Classic. But it still doesn’t beat Ophelia Lillian Potter.

Ravenclaw_Rebel: Ugh, Ophelia. The human equivalent of a Mary Sue smoothie blended with pure cringe.

HogwartsReject: She’s like if Voldemort and a reality TV star had a baby.

LucaTheSnarkLord: I swear, if I had a Galleon for every cliché in that fic, I’d buy the Ministry of Magic and fire everyone.

The replies came fast.

MagicMike27: “I’m Ophelia, the most powerful witch ever!” Shut up, girl, you were adopted by a guy who uses peacocks as lawn decorations.

Ravenclaw_Rebel: Her wardrobe was 90% black leather. Did she shop at “Hot Topic for Dark Wizards” or what?

LucaTheSnarkLord: Honestly, if I woke up in that dumpster fire, first thing I’d do is stop Ophelia from ruining the plot.

He chuckled as he hit send. The idea of waking up inside that terrible story was ridiculous. 

He glanced at the time: 2:07 a.m. He yawned, tossing his phone onto his nightstand, where it landed with a clatter next to a coffee mug that read “Mischief Managed”.

“Stupid fanfiction,” he muttered, pulling his blanket over his head. “Glad that nightmare isn’t real…”

So this is my first ever HP fanfic and I've only uploaded two chapters so far, but I want to make sure I don't make any mistakes from the start. So I would appreciate some feedbacks and criticism 🫡

Prepare for a chilling encounter with ""My Brother's Spider."" #MyTwistedTales #MyBrothersSpider #DarkFiction #CreatureFeature #WattpadThriller","**My Brother's Spider Part One** 

My brother, Jeff, was really into spiders. At first, my family and I didn't think much of it. He was always a bit of an oddball, and if playing with those creepy crawlies made him happy, so be it. He'd claim he was studying them, experimenting, even trying to create a new, superior breed of spider. But I knew he was mostly just playing. Or so I thought.

My name is Annette, though most people call me Anna. Some even call me Nettie, which I hate. I was fifteen at the time, and that night, a night I'll never forget, started like any other boring evening at home. Our parents worked the night shift at the mill outside of town, making… well, I never really knew what they made. They'd worked there as long as I could remember, always busy providing us with the comfortable life they never had.

I was half-asleep, watching some cheesy monster movie on TV. I'd start to doze off, only to be jolted awake by visions of giant insects on the screen.

""SKREEEECH! … Paegen?! … Cracker?""

I groaned and chucked a cracker from the coffee table at the birdcage. It exploded against the metal bars, showering our African Grey parrot, Paegen, with crumbs.

""There you go, you freakin' bird,"" I mumbled, laughing at my own meanness.

""SKREEEECH! … You freakin' bird!"" Paegen mimicked.

I tried to get back to sleep, but it was impossible. I was stuck in that limbo between exhaustion and boredom. Finally, I swung my legs off the couch and yelped. Something warm and furry was under my feet!

Our dog, Maxie, yipped and jumped up, startled. ""Stupid dog!"" I grumbled, heading for the kitchen. The house felt like a tomb. I paused at the bottom of the stairs.

""Jeff? I'm gonna make something to eat. Want anything? Hey, bonehead, you still alive up there?""

No response. I shrugged and continued toward the kitchen.

A faint light spilled from Jeff's slightly ajar door. Both hands occupied with a tray of snacks, I kicked the door open. The stench that hit me was… strange. A sweet, almost vinegary odor. But Jeff's room was always a source of weird smells, so I didn't think much of it.

""Hey, bonehead, you gonna eat anything today besides flies?""

My eyes adjusted to the dim light. The room was a disaster of books, papers, and aquariums. But Jeff was nowhere to be seen. I carefully set the tray down on top of an aquarium. How far could a guy in a wheelchair go? I flicked on the overhead light.

""Jeff?""

The sudden brightness revealed my brother sprawled on the floor, his wheelchair overturned. His skin was pale, eyes rolled back. No movement, no breathing. Just… still.

""Jesus, Jeff, no!""

We always knew this day might come. Living with a spinal cord injury meant facing mortality head-on. But why now? Why when I was home alone? Panic swelled. Was he even dead?

Then I saw it – the syringe near his outstretched hand, the plunger fully depressed. Had he taken his own life? Tears welled up, a mix of grief and frustration at my own detached response. I knelt, pressing my fingers to his neck, a tear rolling down my cheek. No pulse. His skin was cold, clammy. He was gone.

But something else was wrong. All the aquariums, jars, and containers that usually housed his spider collection were empty. Or were they? On closer inspection, I saw tiny, dried husks littering the bottom. All the spiders had been devoured. By what? Another—?

Movement caught my eye. Something black scurried across the floor and out the door. A spider, the size of a baseball. A new wave of fear washed over me. I froze, staring at the doorway, waiting for it to reappear. Was it real? Had I imagined it?

Slowly, I crept towards the door, wincing as I passed Jeff's body. I had to get out of that room. My heart pounded as I reached the doorway.

""AHH!"" I gasped, nearly colliding with Maxie. He tilted his head, giving me a quizzical look. ""Stupid dog!"" I hissed, rushing down the hall.

The house was silent as I entered the kitchen. I grabbed the phone, but there was no dial tone. I followed the cord to the wall – it had been chewed clean through.

""Maxie?""

Then I remembered the spider. Why would it chew…? I turned to head for the living room phone and stopped dead.

""SKREEEEECCCHHHHH…""

I tiptoed towards the sound. The living room was draped in spiderwebs, floor to ceiling. I strained to see the source, but it was hidden in the shadows. Then I saw Paegen's cage, also covered in webbing. The tiny door hung open. Paegen was gone.

Taking a deep breath, I stepped into the room. I'd have to wade through webs to reach the phone, and I wasn't sure I could do it. I turned to leave and came face to face with the spider.

It was bigger now, the size of a large squirrel, hanging from a silken thread right in front of me. My mouth opened, and a scream tore from my throat.

""AIIIIEEEEEEEEE…""

The spider, its six black eyes gleaming, answered, ""SKREEEECH… Paegen?! … Cracker?""

It sounded exactly like Paegen. But it was coming from the spider. I backed away and saw her, or what was left of her. She was encased in webbing, her tiny body shriveled, as if something had sucked her dry. I stumbled back, bumping into the end table. Fear gave way to a surge of survival instinct. I wouldn't end up like Paegen. I grabbed the lamp from the table, its base tangled in webbing.

""Come on, you little freak!"" I yelled, yanking at the lamp. ""I'm gonna smash you!""

The spider hesitated, lowered itself to the floor, and started towards me. I pulled the lamp free.

""YOU FREAKIN' BIRD!"" it screeched.

It turned and scurried out the door. Relief washed over me. I should have chased it, finished it off. But I was too shaken. I just stood there, lamp in hand, staring at the doorway.

I needed a real weapon. I couldn't leave the house, not with that thing… with Jeff…

Jeff was dead.

A giant spider was loose in my house.

My knees buckled. I sank to the floor, then forced myself up. I had to do something. I tossed the lamp aside and headed for the kitchen. The cellar door was ajar. Dad had been converting it into a den. Maybe there were weapons down there.

I paused, scanning the kitchen. Nothing. I pushed the cellar door open. The steps descended into darkness. I reached for the light switch, but it did nothing.

Great. The light had to be turned on from downstairs.

I took a deep breath and plunged into the darkness. Halfway down, something brushed past me – large, warm, furry.

""EEK!"" I looked up. Maxie stood at the top of the stairs, staring down.

""Stupid dog!"" I hissed. ""Go get that spider!""

He whined and backed away. I continued down, fumbling for the light string. I tripped over Maxie's food bowl, sending kibble scattering across the floor.

""Jesus!"" I muttered, finally finding the string. I yanked it, and the dim light flickered on.

Dad's workbench was a mess. I spotted a sledgehammer, heavy in my hand. It looked like it could crush the spider… which seemed even bigger now, after eating Paegen. It was as if it grew larger with each victim.

""BARK-ro-ro-ro!...""

""Maxie!!"" I whirled around and headed for the stairs. Then I saw the cabinets filled with paints and sprays. I rummaged through them until I found it: HEAVY DUTY INSECT SPRAY.

Would it work? Spiders weren't insects, were they?

""Brrrrraaaaaooo"" came from upstairs.

""Damn it!"" I raced back up the stairs, bug spray in one hand, sledgehammer in the other. The kitchen was empty.

""Maxie? Here, boy…"" I crept down the hall, peering into the web-filled living room. Nothing.

Then my foot caught on something. I stumbled and fell, the sledgehammer clattering away. Webbing was wrapped around my ankles. I looked up and saw Maxie, his skeletal form hanging from the ceiling.

""No, no, no, no… Maxie… no…""

The spider descended from the ceiling, upside down, right in front of me. It was huge. A drop of slime oozed from its fangs and landed on my forehead. 

It growled.

1hjarzq,https://i.redd.it/6cik6xwvn78e1.png,Muse beauty review - Espresso vanilla and caramel pistachio ,"Based on how many good reviews and recommendations I saw on this sub for past 6months i bought these 2 fragrances from muse beauty.
The 15 ML variants vere out of stock (i really wanted the cute bottle though 😞) so I bought the 30 ML variants for around 569 Rs each with discount .
Onto the review - unlike the raving reviews I saw before my purchase... Both the bottles were slightly disappointing

Cons : 
The first thing you get from these scents is bitter pungent alcohol.. not the general perfume one like literally floor cleaner vibes. 

The notes have a very short life span and vastly different projections.

And the main complaint - they smell almost nothing like the description

Pros : Pretty decent atomizer for this price range , cute packaging, Nice longevity.

Espresso vanilla- This is NOT a coffee perfume it's a jasmine one. After the pungent alcohol evaporates all I get from this is jasmine and bitter almond (middle notes) which stays for an hour or so and settles into woody vanilla skin scents with hint of jasmine. So basically no top notes. The projection of middle notes is nice but the base notes don't last than 1-2 hours. 


Caramel pistachio - we start with the same pungent alcohol that settles into warm coconuty caramel scent moves to a bitter pistachio and returns back to amber / coconut smell. This one has better profile , projection and lasts for 4+ hours. On skin the pistachio was more prominent but if you are looking for caramel it doesn't deliver much. On a side to the coconut in base note on skin skin smells exactly like coconut barfi lol .


Not sure if they changed the formula or suppliers but it seems like their recent deliveries are not holding up to the hype created in last 6 months. 

Anyways let me know if you have any recommendations for affordable coffee fragrances since this was a dud for me.

It may have been the middle of June, all the same.

So I just got done with the 3rd semester of my bachelor's, just sitting in my parents house, doing nothing. I live in a mountainous area so it's too cold to do anything. It's been a couple of weeks since I got back home. Just watching movies, going for a ride every now and then with my old school pals and stuff. 

So I was rewatching band of brothers for the nth time today on the last episode and something struck a nerve so I wanted to get my affairs in order. 

I am a decent student, good at studies not a hard worker though, good enough to get absolutely hammered on Sunday and throw up and score a B in a test on Tuesday. Don't get As cause I mostly spent most of my time playing poker in my dorm. 

So I wanna bring some order in my life, a semblance of routine. Start cleaning my room, start eating healthy and stuff. I work out so there is something to build upon. Maybe start working on my future given I've only got a couple of years before I enter the job market. Maybe not masturbate as much. Get some courage a daal out some nice girl instead, spend money on coffee with her rather than beer or rum with the boys.

Thinking of quitting smoking as well but that ones a maybe for now. I don't really care about the health risks and cancer, I'll die when I die but I don't like lying to my parents, sneaking out of the house to get a smoke. 

Idk I am in a weird state, I don't have this burning motivation to turn things around but I wanna start making small changes for the better to help myself. Make my bed after waking up, take a bath everyday, maybe not play cards from sunset to sunrise or smoke weed 5 times a week. 

I wanna sort things out.

Hey everyone, 

I’m looking to connect with some awesome people for casual hangouts and meaningful conversations. I’m particularly hoping to make good female friends who enjoy sharing laughs, stories, and positive vibes.  

A bit about me:  
- I love movies , or travel.  
- Always down for a good coffee chat or exploring new places.  
- Open-minded and believe in building genuine connections.  

If you’re looking for the same, feel free to drop a message or comment below. Let’s vibe and make some great memories!  

Cheers! ",2,1734790291.0,Hyderabadgirlshangout,0,1.0,False
