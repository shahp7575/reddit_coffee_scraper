1n2tctx,https://i.redd.it/19hzba1ruulf1.png,Demo is now live for Vault Survivors - My solo dev project that's been 1+ years in the making!,"After countless late nights and way too much coffee, I'm finally ready to share what I've been working on. Vault Survivors is a post-apocalyptic action roguelike that combines the frantic gameplay of Vampire Survivors with deep narrative elements and meaningful character progression.

**The Story**

You play as Lucy, awakening from cryogenic sleep in an underground vault after a nuclear catastrophe has rendered the surface uninhabitable. Guided by an robot named Azazel, you must venture into the wasteland to collect genetic material from mutated creatures and work toward rebuilding human civilization. The deeper you go, the more you'll uncover about what really happened to the world and your role in its future. Without spoiling anything, let's just say not everything is as it initially appears.

**Gameplay**

The core loop revolves around surviving increasingly intense waves of mutants while your weapons automatically target enemies around you. Between runs, you return to your vault hub where you can upgrade your gear, unlock new weapons, and engage in dialogue sequences that reveal more of the story. The vault serves as both your safe haven and the primary vehicle for narrative progression.

**Content**

* 30+ unique weapons, each with 7 upgrade tiers
* 10+ different enemy types ranging from basic ghouls to enemies with different gimmicks
* 3 maps with their own challenges
* Multiple difficulty modes for different player skill levels
* 3 playable characters, each with unique starting loadouts and backstories
* Dozens of dialogues that reveal lore
* Extensive achievement system that unlocks new weapons and content

The demo gives you access to the first map and enough content to get a real feel for both the combat mechanics and story direction. I've put a lot of effort into making sure the narrative actually matters rather than just being window dressing for the action.

Steam page is live and I'd love to hear what you think! This has been a massive learning experience as my first major solo project.

Has anyone else run into this? Any idea what might be causing it?

For reference, I’ve attached a photo of the pucks in the bin. The coffee itself tastes great, but the pucks don’t seem very solid (not sure if that matters).

\- - - - -

With temptations addressed, let's continue on to assumptions; another fundamentally misunderstood concept. The discrepancy here is relatively straightforward.

Assumptions - to a certain degree - are just lies.

Not the brazen, reality-breaking kind like *Watergate* or the ancient Greek diplomat claiming *“there are no soldiers inside this giant, wooden horse,”* with a shit-eating grin painted across their face. Assumptions are quieter falsehoods. Self-directed lies of omission. We assume things to be true when we desperately *want* them to be true. Clarification carries the distinct possibility of proving the opposite of our preferred truth, so why bother? It’s a bad bet. A risk not worth taking. Better to smooth out the harsh edges of reality with a healthy dose of conjecture and just call it day.

Unconvinced?

Or, even more telling, in disagreement?

Allow me to provide an example.

**Assumption:** My boss hasn’t fired me. *CLM Pharmaceuticals* hasn’t put me down like a horse with a broken leg. Therefore, they didn’t see me dip my hand in the sample jar. They don’t know I left the compound with a piece of the oil. No need to worry.

**Truth:** Jim, the head security officer, said it best:

*“We’re always watching, my dear. Remember that.”*

Need another? Something more recent? Fresher?

**Assumption:** The security camera stationed in the northwest corner of my lab is *just* a camera. Hasn’t done a damn thing to suggest otherwise. Feels like a safe bet, right?

**Truth:** Apparently it’s an intercom, too. The Executive responsible for hiring me called me to his office today through a speaker concealed on the underside of the device.

The unexpected swoon of his familiar voice materializing from the void as I was attempting to work quite literally put the fear of God in me. I leapt backward from my lab table and shrieked like a banshee. Some rogue gesture, whether it was the flailing of my arms or the spasming of my shoulders, collided with the company’s weathered microscope, knocking it off the edge and sending it crashing to the floor. When all was said and done, I couldn’t even recall what he said. Thankfully, that deficit seemed apparent to my voyeur.

*“…need me to repeat the instructions, Helen?”*

I gave the empty air a meek, hesitant nod. He relayed the instructions a second time. Still quivering a little under the influence of epinephrine, I tiptoed over to the steel double doors, and pressed the *up* arrow on the dashboard. The doors opened immediately, almost as if the carriage itself hadn’t moved an inch since I’d entered the lab three hours prior.

But that couldn't be true, right?

\- - - - -

**August 28th, 2025 - Morning**

*CLM* headquarters was certainly a monument to their dominance of the industry: a decadent altar to a once boundless prosperity and an impenetrable, corporate stronghold in the most medieval sense of the word. It just wasn't apparent *when* that dominance occurred, because it clearly wasn't ongoing.

Based on how empty the place was, that golden age seemed to have long since passed.

The compound’s architecture was reminiscent of a colossal, upright plunger: a domed foundation that narrowed at the center, with sleek, box-shaped offices that extended upwards floor by floor, thousands of feet into the atmosphere. All the communal spaces were within the dome, things like the cafeteria, security office, greenhouse, gymnasium, bar, nursery, library, chapel, apiary…so on and so on. The functional spaces were above. To continue with the plunger analogy, my lab was about one-fifth of the way up the handle. If it had any windows, I’d probably be able to see a faint silhouette of the city’s skyline from that height.

When I arrived in the morning, I’d pace through the modern, conservatively-furnished lobby, past the aforementioned communal spaces, towards the compound’s singular elevator. Before ascending, however, I’d have to navigate the security queue, an expansive, almost maze-like series of roped-off walkways. There was never any line for the elevator, because I seemed to be the only person who *used* the damn thing. Despite that, protocol demanded I endure a stroll through the entire labyrinth, which was always as vacant as a church parking lot on December 26th, as opposed to skipping the redundancy and saving a few minutes by walking around the side of it all. The *clack* of my heels tapping against the linoleum floor would echo generously through the chamber as I gradually made my way to the end of the queue, twisting and turning until I finally reached the abandoned security checkpoint, which was nothing more than neck-high desk with a dusty sign that read *“Please wait your turn”* and a drab, beige umbrella to shield the non-existent guard from being cooked by beams of sunlight radiating through the windows scattered across the ceiling of the dome.

I say *non-existent* because I never saw anyone posted there, so I believed, until recently, that there was no guard. In retrospect, however, I do recall noticing cheap disposable coffee cups appearing and disappearing from the surface of the desk - there one day, gone the next - so perhaps there *was* someone on duty; we just never crossed paths. Odd, but not impossible. Another assumption proved hollow.

Another lie for the pile, another temptation obliged - so the old saying goes.

Anyway, I’d close my eyes, count to ten, and *""wait my turn""* per protocol. Why do it? Well, as mentioned, they were always watching. Security cameras littered the outside of the elevator shaft like boils on the skin of a peasant about to succumb to the black plague, haphazardly placed and too numerous to count, all angled down to monitor the lobby. Just as with the mandated meditation, I didn’t push back against protocol, even though the protocol felt patently ridiculous in practice.

On the count of ten, I’d pass the checkpoint, call the elevator, type *32* into the elevator’s digital keypad, tap my badge against the reader, and *presto -* the doors would soon open to my home away from home.

This morning, however, The Executive instructed me via the previously undetected intercom to leave my post, enter the elevator, and type *272.*

The gears and the pulleys whirred to life before I even placed my badge against the reader. Made me wonder if that step was necessary to begin with. As the machine carried me higher and higher, I tried to remember *why* that was part of my routine. Where did I learn it? Was it part of the protocol? Did I just start doing it of my own accord for some inane reason? My futile attempts at dissecting that mystery were fortunately interrupted by the shrill chiming of a digital bell. The gentle humming of the elevator motor died out. When the doors opened, he was staring right at me from directly across the room, bloodshot gray-blue eyes full and seething with either rage or excitement.

God, and I thought the lobby was *conservatively-furnished*.

Wood-paneled flooring, lacquered with some ancient, jellied varnish.

Blank walls the color of table salt to match the identically blank ceiling.

A small, unadorned desk,

A red-leather, wing-backed chair, decorated with strange, runic symbols embroidered in the leather with silver thread,

and *him*.

*“Helen! What a pleasant surprise…”* he remarked, waving me in from the safety of the elevator carriage.

I crossed the threshold. Instantly, a strong chemical scent wafted into my nostrils: bleach with a tinge of sweetness. As my feet crept forward, my head jerked back from the odor, searching for cleaner air.

*“Surprise, Sir? You called me up here,”* I replied.

He leaned over the desk and gave me a deflated, mirthless chuckle.

*“Oh, I never count my chickens before they hatch. Living without expectations can be ferociously joyful. For me, everything’s a bit of a surprise.”* Recognition flashed across his face. He pulled open one of the drawers and began rummaging through its contents.

*“You really should try it. But enough catching up - surely you know why I summoned you?”*

I *assumed* it was to discuss the specimen theft I’d committed months ago, as detailed previously, and the series of events that followed, which I've only partially documented for you fine people, but you know what they say about assumptions. He slammed the drawer shut and dropped a stack of papers on the desk. As I brainstormed, calculating a strategic answer to his question, the chemical odor sharply worsened. He interpreted the coughing fit that followed to mean: *""no, I don't have the faintest idea why you summoned me - please, do tell”*

*“Well…”* he continued, reaching into his suit jacket and flipping on a pair of reading glasses, *“here’s a hint.”*

After some uncomfortable trial and error, I discovered a pocket of air in the back left corner of the room that was decidedly less harsh. My hacking slowly abated. In a weird moment of symmetry, the Executive began forcefully clearing his throat, as if he was taking over where I left off. He then gathered the stack of papers and began reading.

“***The light was off, but critically; I didn’t watch it turn off. How long had the feed been dead? One tenth of a second or nine? It was impossible to know.”*** His voice was overly animated, with tight punctuation and crisp enunciation, like he was recording an audiobook. He glanced up at me, the bottom half of his face hidden behind the transcript.

My jaw practically hit the floor. I’d been stewing over my lustful ingestion of the oil for *months* now. I held cavalcades of half-answers to what seemed like millions of unasked questions between the folds of my brain - so much so that my head felt heavier on my shoulders - in an attempt to be prepared for this moment. The point at which I’d either have to defend my actions or lie through my teeth.

I feel a bit embarrassed to say I was unprepared for this *particular* angle, but I suppose I have no one to blame but myself.

*“No? Not ringing a bell? Curious.”* He leafed through the packet and located another excerpt.

*“Ah ! How about: ‘* ***I*** ***always liked the way her blonde curls danced over her shoulders, but I couldn’t stand the sight of the graying strands buried within. The color was a pollutant. It matched the oil to a tee. Made me want to cut the follicles from her skull and swallow them whole.’***”

The Executive smiled at me. It felt like his lips didn’t know how to do anything else.

*“You…read what I posted online?”* I whimpered.

He lobbed the stack of papers over his shoulder.

*“No, of course not! I had someone print out what you wrote, and then I read it. Edited it a little, too.* ‘*I always liked the way her blonde curls danced* ***over*** *her shoulders’ reads a lot snappier than ‘I* ***had*** *always liked the way her blonde curls danced* ***on*** *her shoulders’, but that's neither here nor there.”*

He cupped his hand around his mouth, swollen eyes cartoonishly darting from side to side, lowering his voice to a whisper.

*“My secret to success? I* ***never*** *go online; just isn’t safe anymore. You know that’s where he lives, right? The thing that makes the oil? The man who's here to end it all?”*

My hand began reaching for the elevator’s control panel. He wagged a smooth, alabaster finger in my direction.

*“Helen! Where on earth do you think you’re going?”*

Honestly, a new plan had abruptly crystalized in my mind, and it was exceptionally simple.

Get downstairs.

Find my car.

And drive.

I recognize this next statement may be confusing - mostly because I haven’t gotten to this part in the story yet - but I think it still deserves to be said, even without the appropriate context:

What did I have left to lose by leaving, anyway?

The people I loved were long gone, and that was my fault.

Might as well just fuck off into obscurity.

*“I mean…I was going to leave. I’m assuming I’m…fired…for what I wrote?”*

A lengthy, pregnant pause followed.

I really had no way of anticipating what came next.

He tried to appear stoic, but failed, discharging a tiny, capricious snicker.

From there, the dam broke.

He simply couldn’t hold it in anymore.

The Executive erupted into violent laughter. His cheeks became flushed. Tears streamed down his face. He cackled until he’d divested every single molecule of oxygen he had to his name, and then he just began wheezing, his expression twisted into a surreal caricature of elation throughout the entire episode. I closed my eyes and placed my hands over my ears. I couldn’t absorb the brunt of it.

There's something desperately wrong with that man.

Eventually, I creaked a single eyelid open. His joy-flavored seizure seemed to be calming. He flicked a tear from the bridge of his drenched nose and sent a tight fist down onto the desk like a gavel.

*“Oh, wow…good one, Helen. Truly superb. Lord knows I needed that.”*

I think I smiled. I tried to at least.

*“Back to brass tax, though: No! Of course you’re not fired. What a downright silly notion!”*

A rapid exhale whistled through his teeth, and he released a few more sputtering giggles. Aftershocks. Fear aggregated in the pit of my stomach. I thought his fit was going to start over again anew.

*“It’s just…it’s just such a comical scenario. Let me help you understand. Picture this: you wake up at home. You trudge into the kitchen - starving, depressed, and at your wit's end - just hoping for the smallest, most measly of comforts from your steadfast companion: the toaster. To your complete and utter heartbreak, however, it burns your toast. It burns your toast no matter what, because it’s old and newly broken, and…and then the toaster pipes up and asks you if it’s fired! What a lark! The absurdity! The gall of that appliance, thinking so highly of itself! Oh, yes, certainly, you're fired, and you know what, let me get your severance package…should be at the bottom of this trash compactor…of course I don't mind helping you in, no trouble at all...”*

The implications of that statement shuddered down my spine in waves. Can’t imagine my distress was subtle, but he didn’t seem to react to it. Either he didn’t notice or didn’t really care, the latter being the more likely explanation.

*“All jokes aside, Helen - you’re our most promising refiner. We need you; we really do. And this story you've created is so…fantastical! Grandiose and high-falutin and profoundly, profoundly dumb. Idiotic to the point of parody. Talk about not seeing the forest through the trees! You’re firing a bazooka at point-blank range and somehow still missing the point.* *Ugh, and the narrative choices - just outlandish! The 'meditation'? You, a 'world renowned chemist'? It's hysterical! Finally, a well-deserved ounce of levity for us up top. I'm sure you've seen the state of the compound; the disrepair of our company. To say your 'recollection' has been a much-needed light during some very dark times for upper management would be an egregious undersale. You’re of course planning on finishing it soon, correct?”*

I peeled my gaze away from his bloodshot eyes, sheepishly scratching the back of my neck.

*“Uhm…I’m not sure. I’m struggling…I’m struggling to find the ending. The point of all this isn’t…isn’t as evident to me, I guess. Originally, I thought I was doing it for myself. Like a protest, or a confession, or something. Really, though…really, I was doing it for Linda, but, as you’re well aware…she’s gone.”*

Silence dripped painfully into my ears. All the while, I kept my gaze sequestered to the floor, tracing the lines in the wood flooring repeatedly, waiting for him to respond.

He never did.

Not till I looked back up at him.

For the first and only time, his smile was absent.

*“We can bring her back, you know,”* he said, voice coarse, like it was laced with gravel.

*“I mean,* ***we*** *wouldn’t. Not personally, not directly, but we could put the dominos in motion, and then* ***you’d*** *bring her back. Like I said, you’re our best refiner.”*

My heart began to somersault. My mouth felt dry, nearly moisture-less. I begged my fingers to reach for the *down*button, but they refused to listen. I was paralyzed where I stood.

*“I can’t imagine that’d be pleasant from your side of things. Not one bit. That wouldn’t be the end of it, either. We would dismantle her. You'd* ***watch*** *us dismantle her. Then, you’d bring her back again. Takes talent and genetics to be able to create a Barren, but it takes practice, too. I’d be more than happy to burden you with some very, very specific practice. As much as it took to internalize your position in this hierarchy.”*

*“Am I understood?”* he growled.

I nodded.

Having touched nothing, the elevator chimed, and the doors opened.

*“Perfect! Can’t wait, Helen, truly I can’t wait,”* he purred.

His perfect smile returned. I backpedaled, refusing to take my eyes off of him for even a second. Practically fell as I stumbled into the elevator.

As the doors began to close, he bellowed one last request.

*“Feel free to dramatize this meeting as well! Really excited to see how you spin it, with your tried-and-true piggish emotional density and your apparent grasp on black humor. And, to be clear, this is more than just a creative recommendation, Helen.”*

They shut with a heavy click.

I heard him begin to laugh again as I finally, mercifully, descended.

Took about a minute before I couldn't hear him any longer.

\- - - - -

With that out of the way, I suppose I can continue where I left off.

Here's a teaser:

*Why does the carbon-based, non-cellular grease move with purpose?*

***Because it wants to be whole.***

*What’s the unidentifiable five percent?*

***Well, it’s what’s left over, of course.***

***Left over when he’s done with you.***

1n2t5f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1n2t5f9/aio_thinking_about_leaving_my_boyfriend/,AIO Thinking about leaving my boyfriend,"I (27f) have been with my boyfriend (25m) for over 3 years. We have a daughter together and I have a son from a previous relationship. Things were rocky in the beginning and we have had some rough patches. We have been doing better recently and that would usually make people happy and I am half the time but the other half of the time I feel alone. My boyfriend and I both used to work but back in June he told me to quit my job and find a new one. It was a very toxic work environment and it was taking its toll. I told him if I did then I’d hear all about how I’m not working and this and that. He said well I know you will have another job soon. I asked him what if I didn’t? He said well would cross that bridge when we get there. Well I didn’t find a new job. No where was hiring. I applied to over 100 different places and they either couldn’t work with the schedule I would need for the kids or they weren’t hiring because summer is slow season. I did hear about how I’m lazy and I’m not doing enough. I agree. I wasn’t cleaning the house the way I should have been. I was spending a lot of time in bed. Just having no energy and not having motivation to do anything. I do have depression and anxiety and a personality disorder all diagnosed and I do take meds for all of it. While doing all this I was trying to get into collage and I did. I started in the middle of this month (August) and I also did get a part time job which I start next week. Even thought I’m spending half my time taking care of kids and half my time going to school and half my time trying to clean, it’s been tough. I’m still struggling. I am struggling hard to get everything done. Anyway I know I could manage my time better and get things done. We live with his parents and they can’t do much cleaning due to medical issues with both of them. I was just sitting here realizing that while I was working and cleaning my boyfriend would only work 4 hours a day most days and he didn’t help much with the cleaning. He helps with the kids when I ask but for the most part he plays his video games and goes to his bowling league. Since I quit my job he has picked up more hours at work to make up the difference, however that’s how much he should have been working before. I worry that me getting a job will just mean that he can go back to slacking off and not working as much. His field makes it where he pretty much can work when he wants. I’ve just done a lot of thinking and he barely makes time for me. We have only gone out on one date in 8 months….8 MONTHS! And it was for my birthday. We went on vacation with his family the first week of August and I was the one with the kids while he didn’t help much whatever he wanted. He only spent time with me when we were all hanging out together and then one night he watched a movie with me before we went to bed. I’m just realizing that I’m not a priority or at least I don’t feel like one. His sister just called him and said hey I’m coming over and he got right off the game. I was trying to talk to him and he told me he was just relaxing and playing his games. He didn’t even give me a second thought and that happens all the time. I feel like even though we aren’t arguing much or fighting, we aren’t better. He’s more distant than ever. He barely gives me a second glance. He won’t go to the store or outside the house for anything but he will call me from work to go get him coffee and bring it to him and I will get the kids ready and pack them into the car, go to the coffee shop, get his coffee and drive it to him.

With temptations addressed, let's continue on to assumptions; another fundamentally misunderstood concept. The discrepancy here is relatively straightforward.

Assumptions - to a certain degree - are just lies.

Not the brazen, reality-breaking kind like *Watergate* or the ancient Greek diplomat claiming *“there are no soldiers inside this giant, wooden horse,”* with a shit-eating grin painted across their face. Assumptions are quieter falsehoods. Self-directed lies of omission. We assume things to be true when we desperately *want* them to be true. Clarification carries the distinct possibility of proving the opposite of our preferred truth, so why bother? It’s a bad bet. A risk not worth taking. Better to smooth out the harsh edges of reality with a healthy dose of conjecture and just call it day.

Unconvinced?

Or, even more telling, in disagreement?

Allow me to provide an example.

**Assumption:** My boss hasn’t fired me. *CLM Pharmaceuticals* hasn’t put me down like a horse with a broken leg. Therefore, they didn’t see me dip my hand in the sample jar. They don’t know I left the compound with a piece of the oil. No need to worry.

**Truth:** Jim, the head security officer, said it best:

*“We’re always watching, my dear. Remember that.”*

Need another? Something more recent? Fresher?

**Assumption:** The security camera stationed in the northwest corner of my lab is *just* a camera. Hasn’t done a damn thing to suggest otherwise. Feels like a safe bet, right?

**Truth:** Apparently it’s an intercom, too. The Executive responsible for hiring me called me to his office today through a speaker concealed on the underside of the device.

The unexpected swoon of his familiar voice materializing from the void as I was attempting to work quite literally put the fear of God in me. I leapt backward from my lab table and shrieked like a banshee. Some rogue gesture, whether it was the flailing of my arms or the spasming of my shoulders, collided with the company’s weathered microscope, knocking it off the edge and sending it crashing to the floor. When all was said and done, I couldn’t even recall what he said. Thankfully, that deficit seemed apparent to my voyeur.

*“…need me to repeat the instructions, Helen?”*

I gave the empty air a meek, hesitant nod. He relayed the instructions a second time. Still quivering a little under the influence of epinephrine, I tiptoed over to the steel double doors, and pressed the *up* arrow on the dashboard. The doors opened immediately, almost as if the carriage itself hadn’t moved an inch since I’d entered the lab three hours prior.

But that couldn't be true, right?

\- - - - -

**August 28th, 2025 - Morning**

*CLM* headquarters was certainly a monument to their dominance of the industry: a decadent altar to a once boundless prosperity and an impenetrable, corporate stronghold in the most medieval sense of the word. It just wasn't apparent *when* that dominance occurred, because it clearly wasn't ongoing.

Based on how empty the place was, that golden age seemed to have long since passed.

The compound’s architecture was reminiscent of a colossal, upright plunger: a domed foundation that narrowed at the center, with sleek, box-shaped offices that extended upwards floor by floor, thousands of feet into the atmosphere. All the communal spaces were within the dome, things like the cafeteria, security office, greenhouse, gymnasium, bar, nursery, library, chapel, apiary…so on and so on. The functional spaces were above. To continue with the plunger analogy, my lab was about one-fifth of the way up the handle. If it had any windows, I’d probably be able to see a faint silhouette of the city’s skyline from that height.

When I arrived in the morning, I’d pace through the modern, conservatively-furnished lobby, past the aforementioned communal spaces, towards the compound’s singular elevator. Before ascending, however, I’d have to navigate the security queue, an expansive, almost maze-like series of roped-off walkways. There was never any line for the elevator, because I seemed to be the only person who *used* the damn thing. Despite that, protocol demanded I endure a stroll through the entire labyrinth, which was always as vacant as a church parking lot on December 26th, as opposed to skipping the redundancy and saving a few minutes by walking around the side of it all. The *clack* of my heels tapping against the linoleum floor would echo generously through the chamber as I gradually made my way to the end of the queue, twisting and turning until I finally reached the abandoned security checkpoint, which was nothing more than neck-high desk with a dusty sign that read *“Please wait your turn”* and a drab, beige umbrella to shield the non-existent guard from being cooked by beams of sunlight radiating through the windows scattered across the ceiling of the dome.

I say *non-existent* because I never saw anyone posted there, so I believed, until recently, that there was no guard. In retrospect, however, I do recall noticing cheap disposable coffee cups appearing and disappearing from the surface of the desk - there one day, gone the next - so perhaps there *was* someone on duty; we just never crossed paths. Odd, but not impossible. Another assumption proved hollow.

Another lie for the pile, another temptation obliged - so the old saying goes.

Anyway, I’d close my eyes, count to ten, and *""wait my turn""* per protocol. Why do it? Well, as mentioned, they were always watching. Security cameras littered the outside of the elevator shaft like boils on the skin of a peasant about to succumb to the black plague, haphazardly placed and too numerous to count, all angled down to monitor the lobby. Just as with the mandated meditation, I didn’t push back against protocol, even though the protocol felt patently ridiculous in practice.

On the count of ten, I’d pass the checkpoint, call the elevator, type *32* into the elevator’s digital keypad, tap my badge against the reader, and *presto -* the doors would soon open to my home away from home.

This morning, however, The Executive instructed me via the previously undetected intercom to leave my post, enter the elevator, and type *272.*

The gears and the pulleys whirred to life before I even placed my badge against the reader. Made me wonder if that step was necessary to begin with. As the machine carried me higher and higher, I tried to remember *why* that was part of my routine. Where did I learn it? Was it part of the protocol? Did I just start doing it of my own accord for some inane reason? My futile attempts at dissecting that mystery were fortunately interrupted by the shrill chiming of a digital bell. The gentle humming of the elevator motor died out. When the doors opened, he was staring right at me from directly across the room, bloodshot gray-blue eyes full and seething with either rage or excitement.

God, and I thought the lobby was *conservatively-furnished*.

Wood-paneled flooring, lacquered with some ancient, jellied varnish.

Blank walls the color of table salt to match the identically blank ceiling.

A small, unadorned desk,

A red-leather, wing-backed chair, decorated with strange, runic symbols embroidered in the leather with silver thread,

and *him*.

*“Helen! What a pleasant surprise…”* he remarked, waving me in from the safety of the elevator carriage.

I crossed the threshold. Instantly, a strong chemical scent wafted into my nostrils: bleach with a tinge of sweetness. As my feet crept forward, my head jerked back from the odor, searching for cleaner air.

*“Surprise, Sir? You called me up here,”* I replied.

He leaned over the desk and gave me a deflated, mirthless chuckle.

*“Oh, I never count my chickens before they hatch. Living without expectations can be ferociously joyful. For me, everything’s a bit of a surprise.”* Recognition flashed across his face. He pulled open one of the drawers and began rummaging through its contents.

*“You really should try it. But enough catching up - surely you know why I summoned you?”*

I *assumed* it was to discuss the specimen theft I’d committed months ago, as detailed previously, and the series of events that followed, which I've only partially documented for you fine people, but you know what they say about assumptions. He slammed the drawer shut and dropped a stack of papers on the desk. As I brainstormed, calculating a strategic answer to his question, the chemical odor sharply worsened. He interpreted the coughing fit that followed to mean: *""no, I don't have the faintest idea why you summoned me - please, do tell”*

*“Well…”* he continued, reaching into his suit jacket and flipping on a pair of reading glasses, *“here’s a hint.”*

After some uncomfortable trial and error, I discovered a pocket of air in the back left corner of the room that was decidedly less harsh. My hacking slowly abated. In a weird moment of symmetry, the Executive began forcefully clearing his throat, as if he was taking over where I left off. He then gathered the stack of papers and began reading.

“***The light was off, but critically; I didn’t watch it turn off. How long had the feed been dead? One tenth of a second or nine? It was impossible to know.”*** His voice was overly animated, with tight punctuation and crisp enunciation, like he was recording an audiobook. He glanced up at me, the bottom half of his face hidden behind the transcript.

My jaw practically hit the floor. I’d been stewing over my lustful ingestion of the oil for *months* now. I held cavalcades of half-answers to what seemed like millions of unasked questions between the folds of my brain - so much so that my head felt heavier on my shoulders - in an attempt to be prepared for this moment. The point at which I’d either have to defend my actions or lie through my teeth.

I feel a bit embarrassed to say I was unprepared for this *particular* angle, but I suppose I have no one to blame but myself.

*“No? Not ringing a bell? Curious.”* He leafed through the packet and located another excerpt.

*“Ah ! How about: ‘* ***I*** ***always liked the way her blonde curls danced over her shoulders, but I couldn’t stand the sight of the graying strands buried within. The color was a pollutant. It matched the oil to a tee. Made me want to cut the follicles from her skull and swallow them whole.’***”

The Executive smiled at me. It felt like his lips didn’t know how to do anything else.

*“You…read what I posted online?”* I whimpered.

He lobbed the stack of papers over his shoulder.

*“No, of course not! I had someone print out what you wrote, and then I read it. Edited it a little, too.* ‘*I always liked the way her blonde curls danced* ***over*** *her shoulders’ reads a lot snappier than ‘I* ***had*** *always liked the way her blonde curls danced* ***on*** *her shoulders’, but that's neither here nor there.”*

He cupped his hand around his mouth, swollen eyes cartoonishly darting from side to side, lowering his voice to a whisper.

*“My secret to success? I* ***never*** *go online; just isn’t safe anymore. You know that’s where he lives, right? The thing that makes the oil? The man who's here to end it all?”*

My hand began reaching for the elevator’s control panel. He wagged a smooth, alabaster finger in my direction.

*“Helen! Where on earth do you think you’re going?”*

Honestly, a new plan had abruptly crystalized in my mind, and it was exceptionally simple.

Get downstairs.

Find my car.

And drive.

I recognize this next statement may be confusing - mostly because I haven’t gotten to this part in the story yet - but I think it still deserves to be said, even without the appropriate context:

What did I have left to lose by leaving, anyway?

The people I loved were long gone, and that was my fault.

Might as well just fuck off into obscurity.

*“I mean…I was going to leave. I’m assuming I’m…fired…for what I wrote?”*

A lengthy, pregnant pause followed.

I really had no way of anticipating what came next.

He tried to appear stoic, but failed, discharging a tiny, capricious snicker.

From there, the dam broke.

He simply couldn’t hold it in anymore.

The Executive erupted into violent laughter. His cheeks became flushed. Tears streamed down his face. He cackled until he’d divested every single molecule of oxygen he had to his name, and then he just began wheezing, his expression twisted into a surreal caricature of elation throughout the entire episode. I closed my eyes and placed my hands over my ears. I couldn’t absorb the brunt of it.

There's something desperately wrong with that man.

Eventually, I creaked a single eyelid open. His joy-flavored seizure seemed to be calming. He flicked a tear from the bridge of his drenched nose and sent a tight fist down onto the desk like a gavel.

*“Oh, wow…good one, Helen. Truly superb. Lord knows I needed that.”*

I think I smiled. I tried to at least.

*“Back to brass tax, though: No! Of course you’re not fired. What a downright silly notion!”*

A rapid exhale whistled through his teeth, and he released a few more sputtering giggles. Aftershocks. Fear aggregated in the pit of my stomach. I thought his fit was going to start over again anew.

*“It’s just…it’s just such a comical scenario. Let me help you understand. Picture this: you wake up at home. You trudge into the kitchen - starving, depressed, and at your wit's end - just hoping for the smallest, most measly of comforts from your steadfast companion: the toaster. To your complete and utter heartbreak, however, it burns your toast. It burns your toast no matter what, because it’s old and newly broken, and…and then the toaster pipes up and asks you if it’s fired! What a lark! The absurdity! The gall of that appliance, thinking so highly of itself! Oh, yes, certainly, you're fired, and you know what, let me get your severance package…should be at the bottom of this trash compactor…of course I don't mind helping you in, no trouble at all...”*

The implications of that statement shuddered down my spine in waves. Can’t imagine my distress was subtle, but he didn’t seem to react to it. Either he didn’t notice or didn’t really care, the latter being the more likely explanation.

*“All jokes aside, Helen - you’re our most promising refiner. We need you; we really do. And this story you've created is so…fantastical! Grandiose and high-falutin and profoundly, profoundly dumb. Idiotic to the point of parody. Talk about not seeing the forest through the trees! You’re firing a bazooka at point-blank range and somehow still missing the point.* *Ugh, and the narrative choices - just outlandish! The 'meditation'? You, a 'world renowned chemist'? It's hysterical! Finally, a well-deserved ounce of levity for us up top. I'm sure you've seen the state of the compound; the disrepair of our company. To say your 'recollection' has been a much-needed light during some very dark times for upper management would be an egregious undersale. You’re of course planning on finishing it soon, correct?”*

I peeled my gaze away from his bloodshot eyes, sheepishly scratching the back of my neck.

*“Uhm…I’m not sure. I’m struggling…I’m struggling to find the ending. The point of all this isn’t…isn’t as evident to me, I guess. Originally, I thought I was doing it for myself. Like a protest, or a confession, or something. Really, though…really, I was doing it for Linda, but, as you’re well aware…she’s gone.”*

Silence dripped painfully into my ears. All the while, I kept my gaze sequestered to the floor, tracing the lines in the wood flooring repeatedly, waiting for him to respond.

He never did.

Not till I looked back up at him.

For the first and only time, his smile was absent.

*“We can bring her back, you know,”* he said, voice coarse, like it was laced with gravel.

*“I mean,* ***we*** *wouldn’t. Not personally, not directly, but we could put the dominos in motion, and then* ***you’d*** *bring her back. Like I said, you’re our best refiner.”*

My heart began to somersault. My mouth felt dry, nearly moisture-less. I begged my fingers to reach for the *down*button, but they refused to listen. I was paralyzed where I stood.

*“I can’t imagine that’d be pleasant from your side of things. Not one bit. That wouldn’t be the end of it, either. We would dismantle her. You'd* ***watch*** *us dismantle her. Then, you’d bring her back again. Takes talent and genetics to be able to create a Barren, but it takes practice, too. I’d be more than happy to burden you with some very, very specific practice. As much as it took to internalize your position in this hierarchy.”*

*“Am I understood?”* he growled.

I nodded.

Having touched nothing, the elevator chimed, and the doors opened.

*“Perfect! Can’t wait, Helen, truly I can’t wait,”* he purred.

His perfect smile returned. I backpedaled, refusing to take my eyes off of him for even a second. Practically fell as I stumbled into the elevator.

As the doors began to close, he bellowed one last request.

*“Feel free to dramatize this meeting as well! Really excited to see how you spin it, with your tried-and-true piggish emotional density and your apparent grasp on black humor. And, to be clear, this is more than just a creative recommendation, Helen.”*

They shut with a heavy click.

I heard him begin to laugh again as I finally, mercifully, descended.

Took about a minute before I couldn't hear him any longer.

\- - - - -

With that out of the way, I suppose I can continue where I left off.

Here's a teaser:

*Why does the carbon-based, non-cellular grease move with purpose?*

***Because it wants to be whole.***

*What’s the unidentifiable five percent?*

***Well, it’s what’s left over, of course.***

***Left over when he’s done with you.***

She actually declined my coffee invitation, but even after that she stayed very nice to me and we still exchanged a lot of messages.

In April, there was a last round of texts, but by then she was clearly uncomfortable and started pulling away.

In July, her husband found out about the texts (most had already been deleted by then), and it caused major damage in her marriage. Despite this, she still treated me like a friend at work and even tipped me off the same day her husband found out, so I knew he had seen things.

Recently, she reported me to HR. I don’t know what exactly she told them, but HR has now contacted me. I’m very nervous because:
	•	I know what I did crosses professional boundaries.
	•	I’m worried this could cost me my job.
	•	I’m also worried my wife might find out, which could ruin my marriage.
	•	I’ve never been called by HR before, so I don’t know what to expect.

I also want to mention that part of what made this complicated is that outside of just texting, she had helped me with personal things like therapy sessions and even with my college classes. That blurred the lines a lot. She tipped me off when the husband found out.

And then my eyes snapped open.

Right away I could tell he must have been waiting for me to wake up for quite some time. Nevertheless, he still looked surprised as my line of vision went straight to his.

“Come on,” he spoke, extending his hand. “We’re already a bit behind.”

He looked a little exhausted, yet his tone was patient.

“But... I’m tired,” I protested, having barely let any time pass for my eyes to adjust to my surroundings.

“I know,” he said, taking me into the palm of his hands. “But the good news is, you don’t have to play anymore.”

Play anymore?

A clear flashback appeared in my mind:

Me, facing the porcelain white tiles of my bathroom shower, hot tears burning down my cheek.

“I don’t want to play anymore,” I had said, not even fully understanding what I meant back then. Everything felt so hopeless.

When he scooped me up I felt weightless. I had always struggled with feeling like a bag of heavy, wasted space my entire life... yet he picked me up so effortlessly that I finally noticed how much bigger he was than me.

He set me down on the floor gently and started walking ahead with my hand in his.

“Where are we going?” I asked.

“We’re going back to where I found you,” he said, not even bothering to look back at me.

“Should I have brought anything with me?” No matter how big my steps were, his giant ones always stayed ahead.

“No,” he replied. “None of your things will be of use to you when we get there.”

I guessed he was right.

To be honest, I always thought the things I had would bring me some clarity I had not been able to find before. But instead, they became ticks on the list of reasons why this game was never going to work out for me in the first place.

That desk I bought last Christmas? I had envisioned myself sitting at it late at night, rushing to put the finishing edits on that blog I always wanted to start. Instead, it sat full of old coffee cups and makeup I never bothered to put back in my vanity.

“What if I don’t want to go back there? What if I want to stay?”

As I asked this, he paused for a moment, looking down at the ground over his shoulder.

“You know, that’s pretty normal,” he continued, his pace a little faster now.

I stayed quiet the rest of the way. I understood then that nothing I said would change his mind. Everything around us was so far away, it felt like we were walking through a cloud of haze.

We approached a door, so seamlessly blended into the wall you’d hardly notice it from a few steps away.

“Are you ready?” he asked. I met his gaze and nodded, not sure of what else to do in that moment.

As the door opened into a room of pitch black, my attention shifted to another room I hadn’t noticed before, just to my right.

Everything had been quiet before. But now, it felt as if someone had hit “unmute” on the chaos unraveling in the room that appeared out of nowhere.

Out of the three teenagers standing over my lifeless body, only the girl let out a bloodcurdling scream. The two boys stood quietly in horrified shock, never imagining that the object they thought was an abandoned mannequin by the riverbed was actually a person. One of them had tried CPR, but whatever sign of life was there when they first spotted me had now completely disappeared.

My attention snapped back to the room in front of me as the darkness filled with a blinding white light.

“Go ahead,” he said. “We can try again in a few more years.”

I stepped into the room,

And everything went black.

The door closed as he grabbed the clipboard that had been attached to it. Under a box that read *Occupant Return Reason*, he wrote:

With temptations addressed, let's continue on to assumptions; another fundamentally misunderstood concept. The discrepancy here is relatively straightforward.

Assumptions - to a certain degree - are just lies.

Not the brazen, reality-breaking kind like *Watergate* or the ancient Greek diplomat claiming *“there are no soldiers inside this giant, wooden horse,”* with a shit-eating grin painted across their face. Assumptions are quieter falsehoods. Self-directed lies of omission. We assume things to be true when we desperately *want* them to be true. Clarification carries the distinct possibility of proving the opposite of our preferred truth, so why bother? It’s a bad bet. A risk not worth taking. Better to smooth out the harsh edges of reality with a healthy dose of conjecture and just call it day.

Unconvinced?

Or, even more telling, in disagreement?

Allow me to provide an example.

**Assumption:** My boss hasn’t fired me. *CLM Pharmaceuticals* hasn’t put me down like a horse with a broken leg. Therefore, they didn’t see me dip my hand in the sample jar. They don’t know I left the compound with a piece of the oil. No need to worry.

**Truth:** Jim, the head security officer, said it best:

*“We’re always watching, my dear. Remember that.”*

**Assumption:** The security camera stationed in the northwest corner of my lab is *just* a camera. Hasn’t done a damn thing to suggest otherwise. Feels like a safe bet, right?

The unexpected swoon of his familiar voice materializing from the void as I was attempting to work quite literally put the fear of God in me.

*“…need me to repeat the instructions, Helen?”*

I gave the empty air a meek, hesitant nod. He relayed the instructions a second time. Still quivering a little under the influence of epinephrine, I tiptoed over to the steel double doors, and pressed the *up* arrow on the dashboard. The doors opened immediately, almost as if the carriage itself hadn’t moved an inch since I’d entered the lab three hours prior.

But that couldn't be true, right?

**August 28th, 2025 - Morning**

*CLM* headquarters was certainly a monument to their dominance of the industry: a decadent altar to a once boundless prosperity and an impenetrable, corporate stronghold in the most medieval sense of the word. It just wasn't apparent *when* that dominance occurred, because it clearly wasn't ongoing.

Based on how empty the place was, that golden age seemed to have long since passed.

The compound’s architecture was reminiscent of a colossal, upright plunger: a domed foundation that narrowed at the center, with sleek, box-shaped offices that extended upwards floor by floor, thousands of feet into the atmosphere. All the communal spaces were within the dome, things like the cafeteria, security office, greenhouse, gymnasium, bar, nursery, library, chapel, apiary…so on and so on. The functional spaces were above. To continue with the plunger analogy, my lab was about one-fifth of the way up the handle. If it had any windows, I’d probably be able to see a faint silhouette of the city’s skyline from that height.

When I arrived in the morning, I’d pace through the modern, conservatively-furnished lobby, past the aforementioned communal spaces, towards the compound’s singular elevator. Before ascending, however, I’d have to navigate the security queue, an expansive, almost maze-like series of roped-off walkways. There was never any line for the elevator, because I seemed to be the only person who *used* the damn thing. Despite that, protocol demanded I endure a stroll through the entire labyrinth, which was always as vacant as a church parking lot on December 26th, as opposed to skipping the redundancy and saving a few minutes by walking around the side of it all. The *clack* of my heels tapping against the linoleum floor would echo generously through the chamber as I gradually made my way to the end of the queue, twisting and turning until I finally reached the abandoned security checkpoint, which was nothing more than neck-high desk with a dusty sign that read *“Please wait your turn”* and a drab, beige umbrella to shield the non-existent guard from being cooked by beams of sunlight radiating through the windows scattered across the ceiling of the dome.

I say *non-existent* because I never saw anyone posted there, so I believed, until recently, that there was no guard. In retrospect, however, I do recall noticing cheap disposable coffee cups appearing and disappearing from the surface of the desk - there one day, gone the next - so perhaps there *was* someone on duty; we just never crossed paths. Odd, but not impossible. Another assumption proved hollow.

Another lie for the pile, another temptation obliged - so the old saying goes.

Anyway, I’d close my eyes, count to ten, and *""wait my turn""* per protocol. Why do it? Well, as mentioned, they were always watching. Security cameras littered the outside of the elevator shaft like boils on the skin of a peasant about to succumb to the black plague, haphazardly placed and too numerous to count, all angled down to monitor the lobby. Just as with the mandated meditation, I didn’t push back against protocol, even though the protocol felt patently ridiculous in practice.

On the count of ten, I’d pass the checkpoint, call the elevator, type *32* into the elevator’s digital keypad, tap my badge against the reader, and *presto -* the doors would soon open to my home away from home.

This morning, however, The Executive instructed me via the previously undetected intercom to leave my post, enter the elevator, and type *272.*

The gears and the pulleys whirred to life before I even placed my badge against the reader. Made me wonder if that step was necessary to begin with. As the machine carried me higher and higher, I tried to remember *why* that was part of my routine. Where did I learn it? Was it part of the protocol? Did I just start doing it of my own accord for some inane reason? My futile attempts at dissecting that mystery were fortunately interrupted by the shrill chiming of a digital bell. The gentle humming of the elevator motor died out. When the doors opened, he was staring right at me from directly across the room, bloodshot gray-blue eyes full and seething with either rage or excitement.

God, and I thought the lobby was *conservatively-furnished*.

Wood-paneled flooring, lacquered with some ancient, jellied varnish.

Blank walls the color of table salt to match the identically blank ceiling.

A small, unadorned desk,

A red-leather, wing-backed chair, decorated with strange, runic symbols embroidered in the leather with silver thread,

and *him*.

*“Helen! What a pleasant surprise…”* he remarked, waving me in from the safety of the elevator carriage.

I crossed the threshold. Instantly, a strong chemical scent wafted into my nostrils: bleach with a tinge of sweetness. As my feet crept forward, my head jerked back from the odor, searching for cleaner air.

*“Surprise, Sir? You called me up here,”* I replied.

He leaned over the desk and gave me a deflated, mirthless chuckle.

*“Oh, I never count my chickens before they hatch. Living without expectations can be ferociously joyful. For me, everything’s a bit of a surprise.”* Recognition flashed across his face. He pulled open one of the drawers and began rummaging through its contents.

*“You really should try it. But enough catching up - surely you know why I summoned you?”*

I *assumed* it was to discuss the specimen theft I’d committed months ago, as detailed previously, and the series of events that followed, which I've only partially documented for you fine people, but you know what they say about assumptions. He slammed the drawer shut and dropped a stack of papers on the desk. As I brainstormed, calculating a strategic answer to his question, the chemical odor sharply worsened. He interpreted the coughing fit that followed to mean: *""no, I don't have the faintest idea why you summoned me - please, do tell”*

*“Well…”* he continued, reaching into his suit jacket and flipping on a pair of reading glasses, *“here’s a hint.”*

After some uncomfortable trial and error, I discovered a pocket of air in the back left corner of the room that was decidedly less harsh. My hacking slowly abated. In a weird moment of symmetry, the Executive began forcefully clearing his throat, as if he was taking over where I left off. He then gathered the stack of papers and began reading.

“***The light was off, but critically; I didn’t watch it turn off. How long had the feed been dead? One tenth of a second or nine? It was impossible to know.”*** His voice was overly animated, with tight punctuation and crisp enunciation, like he was recording an audiobook. He glanced up at me, the bottom half of his face hidden behind the transcript.

My jaw practically hit the floor. I’d been stewing over my lustful ingestion of the oil for *months* now. I held cavalcades of half-answers to what seemed like millions of unasked questions between the folds of my brain - so much so that my head felt heavier on my shoulders - in an attempt to be prepared for this moment. The point at which I’d either have to defend my actions or lie through my teeth.

I feel a bit embarrassed to say I was unprepared for this *particular* angle, but I suppose I have no one to blame but myself.

*“No? Not ringing a bell? Curious.”* He leafed through the packet and located another excerpt.

*“Ah ! How about: ‘* ***I*** ***always liked the way her blonde curls danced over her shoulders, but I couldn’t stand the sight of the graying strands buried within. The color was a pollutant. It matched the oil to a tee. Made me want to cut the follicles from her skull and swallow them whole.’***”

The Executive smiled at me. It felt like his lips didn’t know how to do anything else.

*“You…read what I posted online?”* I whimpered.

He lobbed the stack of papers over his shoulder.

*“No, of course not! I had someone print out what you wrote, and then I read it. Edited it a little, too.* ‘*I always liked the way her blonde curls danced* ***over*** *her shoulders’ reads a lot snappier than ‘I* ***had*** *always liked the way her blonde curls danced* ***on*** *her shoulders’, but that's neither here nor there.”*

He cupped his hand around his mouth, swollen eyes cartoonishly darting from side to side, lowering his voice to a whisper.

*“My secret to success? I* ***never*** *go online; just isn’t safe anymore. You know that’s where he lives, right? The thing that makes the oil? The man who's here to end it all?”*

My hand began reaching for the elevator’s control panel. He wagged a smooth, alabaster finger in my direction.

*“Helen! Where on earth do you think you’re going?”*

Honestly, a new plan had abruptly crystalized in my mind, and it was exceptionally simple.

Get downstairs.

Find my car.

And drive.

I recognize this next statement may be confusing - mostly because I haven’t gotten to this part in the story yet - but I think it still deserves to be said, even without the appropriate context:

What did I have left to lose by leaving, anyway?

The people I loved were long gone, and that was my fault.

Might as well just fuck off into obscurity.

*“I mean…I was going to leave. I’m assuming I’m…fired…for what I wrote?”*

A lengthy, pregnant pause followed.

I really had no way of anticipating what came next.

He tried to appear stoic, but failed, discharging a tiny, capricious snicker.

From there, the dam broke.

He simply couldn’t hold it in anymore.

The Executive erupted into violent laughter. His cheeks became flushed. Tears streamed down his face. He cackled until he’d divested every single molecule of oxygen he had to his name, and then he just began wheezing, his expression twisted into a surreal caricature of elation throughout the entire episode. I closed my eyes and placed my hands over my ears. I couldn’t absorb the brunt of it.

There's something desperately wrong with that man.

Eventually, I creaked a single eyelid open. His joy-flavored seizure seemed to be calming. He flicked a tear from the bridge of his drenched nose and sent a tight fist down onto the desk like a gavel.

*“Oh, wow…good one, Helen. Truly superb. Lord knows I needed that.”*

I think I smiled. I tried to at least.

*“Back to brass tax, though: No! Of course you’re not fired. What a downright silly notion!”*

A rapid exhale whistled through his teeth, and he released a few more sputtering giggles. Aftershocks. Fear aggregated in the pit of my stomach. I thought his fit was going to start over again anew.

*“It’s just…it’s just such a comical scenario. Let me help you understand. Picture this: you wake up at home. You trudge into the kitchen - starving, depressed, and at your wit's end - just hoping for the smallest, most measly of comforts from your steadfast companion: the toaster. To your complete and utter heartbreak, however, it burns your toast. It burns your toast no matter what, because it’s old and newly broken, and…and then the toaster pipes up and asks you if it’s fired! What a lark! The absurdity! The gall of that appliance, thinking so highly of itself! Oh, yes, certainly, you're fired, and you know what, let me get your severance package…should be at the bottom of this trash compactor…of course I don't mind helping you in, no trouble at all...”*

The implications of that statement shuddered down my spine in waves. Can’t imagine my distress was subtle, but he didn’t seem to react to it. Either he didn’t notice or didn’t really care, the latter being the more likely explanation.

*“All jokes aside, Helen - you’re our most promising refiner. We need you; we really do. And this story you've created is so…fantastical! Grandiose and high-falutin and profoundly, profoundly dumb. Idiotic to the point of parody. Talk about not seeing the forest through the trees! You’re firing a bazooka at point-blank range and somehow still missing the point.* *Ugh, and the narrative choices - just outlandish! The 'meditation'? You, a 'world renowned chemist'? It's hysterical! Finally, a well-deserved ounce of levity for us up top. I'm sure you've seen the state of the compound; the disrepair of our company. To say your 'recollection' has been a much-needed light during some very dark times for upper management would be an egregious undersale. You’re of course planning on finishing it soon, correct?”*

I peeled my gaze away from his bloodshot eyes, sheepishly scratching the back of my neck.

*“Uhm…I’m not sure. I’m struggling…I’m struggling to find the ending. The point of all this isn’t…isn’t as evident to me, I guess. Originally, I thought I was doing it for myself. Like a protest, or a confession, or something. Really, though…really, I was doing it for Linda, but, as you’re well aware…she’s gone.”*

Silence dripped painfully into my ears. All the while, I kept my gaze sequestered to the floor, tracing the lines in the wood flooring repeatedly, waiting for him to respond.

He never did.

Not till I looked back up at him.

For the first and only time, his smile was absent.

*“We can bring her back, you know,”* he said, voice coarse, like it was laced with gravel.

*“I mean,* ***we*** *wouldn’t. Not personally, not directly, but we could put the dominos in motion, and then* ***you’d*** *bring her back. Like I said, you’re our best refiner.”*

My heart began to somersault. My mouth felt dry, nearly moisture-less. I begged my fingers to reach for the *down*button, but they refused to listen. I was paralyzed where I stood.

*“I can’t imagine that’d be pleasant from your side of things. Not one bit. That wouldn’t be the end of it, either. We would dismantle her. You'd* ***watch*** *us dismantle her. Then, you’d bring her back again. Takes talent and genetics to be able to create a Barren, but it takes practice, too. I’d be more than happy to burden you with some very, very specific practice. As much as it took to internalize your position in this hierarchy.”*

*“Am I understood?”* he growled.

I nodded.

Having touched nothing, the elevator chimed, and the doors opened.

*“Perfect! Can’t wait, Helen, truly I can’t wait,”* he purred.

His perfect smile returned. I backpedaled, refusing to take my eyes off of him for even a second. Practically fell as I stumbled into the elevator.

As the doors began to close, he bellowed one last request.

*“Feel free to dramatize this meeting as well! Really excited to see how you spin it, with your tried-and-true piggish emotional density and your apparent grasp on black humor. And, to be clear, this is more than just a creative recommendation, Helen.”*

They shut with a heavy click.

I heard him begin to laugh again as I finally, mercifully, descended.

Took about a minute before I couldn't hear him any longer.

\- - - - -

With that out of the way, I suppose I can continue where I left off.

Here's a teaser:

*Why does the carbon-based, non-cellular grease move with purpose?*

***Because it wants to be whole.***

*What’s the unidentifiable five percent?*

***Well, it’s what’s left over, of course.***

***Left over when he’s done with you.***

With temptations addressed, let's continue on to assumptions; another fundamentally misunderstood concept. The discrepancy here is relatively straightforward.

Assumptions - to a certain degree - are just lies.

Not the brazen, reality-breaking kind like *Watergate* or the ancient Greek diplomat claiming *“there are no soldiers inside this giant, wooden horse,”* with a shit-eating grin painted across their face. Assumptions are quieter falsehoods. Self-directed lies of omission. We assume things to be true when we desperately *want* them to be true. Clarification carries the distinct possibility of proving the opposite of our preferred truth, so why bother? It’s a bad bet. A risk not worth taking. Better to smooth out the harsh edges of reality with a healthy dose of conjecture and just call it day.

Unconvinced?

Or, even more telling, in disagreement?

Allow me to provide an example.

**Assumption:** My boss hasn’t fired me. *CLM Pharmaceuticals* hasn’t put me down like a horse with a broken leg. Therefore, they didn’t see me dip my hand in the sample jar. They don’t know I left the compound with a piece of the oil. No need to worry.

**Truth:** Jim, the head security officer, said it best:

*“We’re always watching, my dear. Remember that.”*

Need another? Something more recent? Fresher?

**Assumption:** The security camera stationed in the northwest corner of my lab is *just* a camera. Hasn’t done a damn thing to suggest otherwise. Feels like a safe bet, right?

**Truth:** Apparently it’s an intercom, too. The Executive responsible for hiring me called me to his office today through a speaker concealed on the underside of the device.

The unexpected swoon of his familiar voice materializing from the void as I was attempting to work quite literally put the fear of God in me. I leapt backward from my lab table and shrieked like a banshee. Some rogue gesture, whether it was the flailing of my arms or the spasming of my shoulders, collided with the company’s weathered microscope, knocking it off the edge and sending it crashing to the floor.

My hand began reaching for the elevator’s control panel. He wagged a smooth, alabaster finger in my direction.

*“Helen! Where on earth do you think you’re going?”*

Honestly, a new plan had abruptly crystalized in my mind, and it was exceptionally simple.

Get downstairs.

Find my car.

And drive.

I recognize this next statement may be confusing - mostly because I haven’t gotten to this part in the story yet - but I think it still deserves to be said, even without the appropriate context:

What did I have left to lose by leaving, anyway?

The people I loved were long gone, and that was my fault.

Might as well just fuck off into obscurity.

*“I mean…I was going to leave. I’m assuming I’m…fired…for what I wrote?”*

A lengthy, pregnant pause followed.

I really had no way of anticipating what came next.

He tried to appear stoic, but failed, discharging a tiny, capricious snicker.

From there, the dam broke.

He simply couldn’t hold it in anymore.

The Executive erupted into violent laughter. His cheeks became flushed. Tears streamed down his face. He cackled until he’d divested every single molecule of oxygen he had to his name, and then he just began wheezing, his expression twisted into a surreal caricature of elation throughout the entire episode. I closed my eyes and placed my hands over my ears. I couldn’t absorb the brunt of it.

There's something desperately wrong with that man.

Eventually, I creaked a single eyelid open. His joy-flavored seizure seemed to be calming. He flicked a tear from the bridge of his drenched nose and sent a tight fist down onto the desk like a gavel.

*“Oh, wow…good one, Helen. Truly superb. Lord knows I needed that.”*

I think I smiled. I tried to at least.

*“Back to brass tax, though: No! Of course you’re not fired. What a downright silly notion!”*

A rapid exhale whistled through his teeth, and he released a few more sputtering giggles. Aftershocks. Fear aggregated in the pit of my stomach. I thought his fit was going to start over again anew.

*“It’s just…it’s just such a comical scenario. Let me help you understand. Picture this: you wake up at home. You trudge into the kitchen - starving, depressed, and at your wit's end - just hoping for the smallest, most measly of comforts from your steadfast companion: the toaster. To your complete and utter heartbreak, however, it burns your toast. It burns your toast no matter what, because it’s old and newly broken, and…and then the toaster pipes up and asks you if it’s fired! What a lark! The absurdity! The gall of that appliance, thinking so highly of itself! Oh, yes, certainly, you're fired, and you know what, let me get your severance package…should be at the bottom of this trash compactor…of course I don't mind helping you in, no trouble at all...”*

The implications of that statement shuddered down my spine in waves. Can’t imagine my distress was subtle, but he didn’t seem to react to it. Either he didn’t notice or didn’t really care, the latter being the more likely explanation.

*“All jokes aside, Helen - you’re our most promising refiner. We need you; we really do. And this story you've created is so…fantastical! Grandiose and high-falutin and profoundly, profoundly dumb. Idiotic to the point of parody. Talk about not seeing the forest through the trees! You’re firing a bazooka at point-blank range and somehow still missing the point.* *Ugh, and the narrative choices - just outlandish! The 'meditation'? You, a 'world renowned chemist'? It's hysterical! Finally, a well-deserved ounce of levity for us up top. I'm sure you've seen the state of the compound; the disrepair of our company. To say your 'recollection' has been a much-needed light during some very dark times for upper management would be an egregious undersale. You’re of course planning on finishing it soon, correct?”*

I peeled my gaze away from his bloodshot eyes, sheepishly scratching the back of my neck.

*“Uhm…I’m not sure. I’m struggling…I’m struggling to find the ending. The point of all this isn’t…isn’t as evident to me, I guess. Originally, I thought I was doing it for myself. Like a protest, or a confession, or something. Really, though…really, I was doing it for Linda, but, as you’re well aware…she’s gone.”*

Silence dripped painfully into my ears. All the while, I kept my gaze sequestered to the floor, tracing the lines in the wood flooring repeatedly, waiting for him to respond.

He never did.

Not till I looked back up at him.

For the first and only time, his smile was absent.

*“We can bring her back, you know,”* he said, voice coarse, like it was laced with gravel.

*“I mean,* ***we*** *wouldn’t. Not personally, not directly, but we could put the dominos in motion, and then* ***you’d*** *bring her back. Like I said, you’re our best refiner.”*

My heart began to somersault. My mouth felt dry, nearly moisture-less. I begged my fingers to reach for the *down*button, but they refused to listen. I was paralyzed where I stood.

*“I can’t imagine that’d be pleasant from your side of things. Not one bit. That wouldn’t be the end of it, either. We would dismantle her. You'd* ***watch*** *us dismantle her. Then, you’d bring her back again. Takes talent and genetics to be able to create a Barren, but it takes practice, too. I’d be more than happy to burden you with some very, very specific practice. As much as it took to internalize your position in this hierarchy.”*

*“Am I understood?”* he growled.

I nodded.

Having touched nothing, the elevator chimed, and the doors opened.

*“Perfect! Can’t wait, Helen, truly I can’t wait,”* he purred.

His perfect smile returned. I backpedaled, refusing to take my eyes off of him for even a second. Practically fell as I stumbled into the elevator.

As the doors began to close, he bellowed one last request.

*“Feel free to dramatize this meeting as well! Really excited to see how you spin it, with your tried-and-true piggish emotional density and your apparent grasp on black humor. And, to be clear, this is more than just a creative recommendation, Helen.”*

They shut with a heavy click.

I heard him begin to laugh again as I finally, mercifully, descended.

Took about a minute before I couldn't hear him any longer.

\- - - - -

With that out of the way, I suppose I can continue where I left off.

Here's a teaser:

*Why does the carbon-based, non-cellular grease move with purpose?*

***Because it wants to be whole.***

*What’s the unidentifiable five percent?*

***Well, it’s what’s left over, of course.***

***Left over when he’s done with you.***

Like they used to live together but now she moved out.

Ive met her a couple of times through work parties, and through several events where it was just the 3 of us hanging out. She and I get along very well, numerous shared interests, I make her laugh, similar upbringings ect. I Have her phone # but it's just used to share photos, or coordinate parking.

However, I'm not sure the right way to move forward, I'm not trying to homewreck a relationship but I really think she and I could have something, I would like to maybe start a conversation with her, or go get coffee. But I'm not sure how to go about it. I feel like now would kind of be a good timing because they just got back from a trip where he said they fought the whole time. 

Ive not interacted with just her and myself, except at a concert when her boyfriend got into the mosh, and she was leaning on me while I was keeping the rollers out of the way.

I have no idea if she feels the same way, nor if she knows how I feel about her.

And before people say ""Dont because she'll do the same to you"" I totally understand, but if it's not meant to be then it's not meant to be.

-Monte cristo sandwich
-Seafood (any, I just love all seafood)
-BBQ
-Duck confit
-Tortillas by the dozen. Where I used to live you could go to a spot downtown and they would sell packs of warm tortillas for like $5 or something.
-theres a gas station called Allsups in the southwest. They have these burritos and chimichangas there that are just wicked unhealthy but taste so good for garbage food. I'm pretty sure Allsups doesn't exist here but is there any good garbage food like this? Something people here know is good at 3am when you're drunk or high but not something that's typically recommended?

Don’t get me wrong — I’ve used all of them. It starts fun, but after a while it grows borring and i feel it only creates shallow connections. And if you get banned (been there), it’s game over.

Lately though, I’ve been trying stuff that feels less soul-sucking. Cerca dating, for example, only matches you with friends-of-friends, which takes away the “stranger danger” factor and makes conversations feel more natural.

The glitch began with the coffee.

It was always the same: a perfect, steaming mug, just the way she liked it, waiting on the kitchen counter every morning. The one morning it wasn't there, she panicked. She searched the cupboards, the pantry, even the refrigerator, but there was no coffee. Her husband, Mark, smiled patiently and said, ""What are you looking for, honey?""
""My coffee,"" she said, her voice shaking. ""It's not here.""
He just laughed and went about his day. She figured she'd just forgotten to make it.
The next day, it was the front door. The lock was gone. The door simply swung open when she touched it. Mark didn't seem to notice. He just walked right through it, as if the lock had never been there. She told him about it, and he just patted her hand and said, ""It's okay, honey, you're just tired.""
The glitches became more frequent, more bizarre. The television would sometimes only show static, but Mark would be sitting there, laughing at a show she couldn't see. Her reflection in the mirror would sometimes be a distorted, weeping stranger. Her favorite sweater, the one he had given her on their first anniversary, became a handful of faded dust.
One afternoon, she came home to find a stranger sitting on her sofa, holding a cup of tea. He smiled at her and said, ""It's so good to see you, son.""
""Who are you?"" she asked, her voice a whisper.
""I'm your father,"" he said.
She ran upstairs to find Mark. But he wasn't there. She looked in the bathroom, in their bedroom, in the closets. He was gone. The only thing left of him was a framed photo on the nightstand, but in the picture, it wasn't her standing beside him. It was a younger version of the stranger from downstairs.
She ran back down, her heart pounding. The man was gone. The sofa was empty. The cup of tea was gone.
She stood in the middle of her living room, her reality unraveling around her. The memories of her life with Mark were starting to fray at the edges, like old film footage. She closed her eyes and saw a different life, a life where she was a man, a life where her father was still alive, a life where Mark had never existed.
When she opened her eyes, a man was standing in front of her, holding a cup of coffee. He smiled and said, ""I made you a cup of coffee, son. You looked tired.""
She looked at him and said, ""Who are you?""
He looked at her with a gentle sadness and said, ""I'm your husband, Mark. Don't you remember?""
She didn't. And as she reached for the coffee, she felt the last remnants of her old life fade away, a ghost in a reality that was never hers to begin with. 

The glitch wasn't in the world; it was in her mind. And it was a glitch that was slowly, painfully, correcting itself.

During her breakfast she's wired to herself that she should waych something to entertain herself while she eats but I just wanted to extend being affectionate so I tried that and she got pissed at me. She said that she just wants to eat while playing her show but now she has to add in giving me attention while she eats and she got really mad over it. 

I wish i didnt extend just wanting to be affectionate even while she ate. I just wanted to share a good morning when i felt like being playful was a good idea.

So, I used to take Lamotrigine 200mg but I had to stop because I started vomiting it every time because of the texture.
(For those who don't know, this medicine is dispersible/chewable and for me the texture is like chalk (+ the taste is like an old and withered orange)). I couldn't chewed it was literally impossible so I started to swallow the faster I can with my coffee. But after a while I began apprehending the moment when I had to swallow the medicine, and I ended up by not being able to take it anymore, and I changed my treatment. I think it's been two years so my memory of the effects of the treatment may be a bit biased.

But here we are ! I tried A LOT of different treatments and they were not very concluent, so I have to try lamotrigine again (otherwise it's lithium and I don't want that). 

So here is my main point: some of you must take this medication and according to my psychiatrist a lot of people struggle with the same difficulties as me (the texture/the taste), so do you have any strategies which allow you to take it ?
I'm apprehending SO MUCH and for the past two days I had nausea just by the IDEA 😭

College grad, fluent in English, Sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits (because nothing says “thrilling drama” like corporate loopholes) and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef. I don’t drink or do drugs—unless you count caffeine (then yes, I’m basically a bean addict). My nightlife is less “clubbing till 2am” and more “building a pillow fort empire and bingeing Netflix until the cliffhanger leaves me emotionally bankrupt.” Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career—bonus points if you can use “there,” “their,” and “they’re” correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than just “hey” (plot twist: you’re actually interesting). You’re the type to send random memes that perfectly capture the chaos of life, because sometimes a well-timed GIF says more than a whole paragraph.
You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos/piercings, or kids—because I like my drama like my Netflix: available on-demand, not in real life. If you’re thoughtful, communicative, and the type who remembers the small things (like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog), we’ll get along just fine.

I kept blaming it on everything else like caffeine, coffee, or even tallow on my face. I am going to try tallow again as a moisturizer just to see if it still breaks me out, but for now I have just been using Hygiene Lab.

The crazy part is I always thought dairy was this magical superfood. I have tried every version of it, raw, A2, you name it. Cutting it out is what finally cleared up my face and back and also got rid of that constant cough and stuffed nose.

If you deal with any of this I would strongly recommend trying to cut out dairy. The animal based community treats it like a must-have but the truth is not everything works for everyone. Some people just do not tolerate it.

Then one evening I was a reading a book in the campus coffee shop. He sits down beside me and we start chatting, and well let’s just say that I fell in love?.

Earlier this year, I got way too friendly with a female colleague (45F). We exchanged a lot of texts in March (over 500 in one month). I invited her for coffee, later even suggested grabbing a beer, and sometimes made excuses to meet her more often through work. I even told her I “missed her” when she skipped a meeting.

She never encouraged me in a romantic way, but she was polite, and I took that as an opening. Her husband (31M) eventually found out. He confronted her, and from what I know, it caused serious damage in their marriage. That’s the part I regret the most — I never wanted to create problems for her home life.

The crazy thing is, she’s still been kind to me even after all this. When her husband saw some of the texts, she actually tipped me off so I’d know. That made me feel like maybe we were still friends despite the awkwardness.

But now things are blowing up. HR reached out, and I might have to answer for my actions. I never physically cheated, but I definitely crossed boundaries emotionally and professionally. I’m terrified my wife (40F) will find out, and I don’t know what HR is going to do.

1n2s4se,https://www.reddit.com/r/plural/comments/1n2s4se/im_not_plural_but/,I'm not plural but...,"Hii, my first time posting anything here, I need some help 

So my mind is a bit of a mess and I have never in my life felt myself entirely after the trauma, I remember when I was pretty young I used to have long ass conversations with ""myself"" in my mind (the answers were from a different voice from mine, talking in a different way from mine and even being a different gender from mine), when I get too overwhelmed with feelings I ""disconnect"", I call it like that, is like I'm wishing so hard to not be in that situation that mi mind just go completely quiet and I feel numb and I don't feel like myself and sometimes I don't even recognize where I am or who am I, and I don't feel like my name is mine in those moments, but I'm still there? I remember it and I FEEL like I have control of the situation even though my body doesn't react how I want. 

Sometimes I feel like me and my brain are separate entities, and sometimes I think things that I wasn't thinking (is not like intrusive thoughts, I have those and it feels different), sometimes I answer myself without actually wanting to? Like I say something dumb and I answer myself out loud like a different person, but the thing is I wasn't thinking of that? And sometimes when this happens I just go like ""wtf was that??""

I hear talking in my head, most of the time my head sounds like a full coffee shop, you know, people talking but you can't really made out what each person is individually saying and there's like 200 people in the coffee shop too- but sometimes is more clear, and the voices are slightly different from each others (but most of them sounds like mine), sometimes they talk to each others??? And I swear one time I heard one sneeze somehow? 

One time I had a system bf, and after a fight I had a panic attack and... Based on his words I had a ""switch"" but I don't remember that? From my perspective it felt just like when I disconnect, I wasn't another person... But I wasn't myself either, is weird, I just told him he was lying and he was like ""no, that happened, and [alter] is present rn he can confirm, I know you trust him more"" and  I was like I'M FUCKED

So uhh how crazy I am?? Because I been with psychologists and stuff before (I'm diagnosed with StPD, autism and social anxiety, and I have ""bpd-like"" symptoms or something like that) but none of them could say tf is wrong with me in this aspect, they say I'm not a system but I feel like something isn't okay

(Btw the voices are more clear and common to talk to me directly at night, idk if that's related) ",4,1756424908.0,plural,2,1.0,False

1n2s3jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/cedarpoint/comments/1n2s3jc/thoughts_comments_and_concerns_from_my_fellow_cp/,"Thoughts, comments, and concerns from my fellow CP enthusiasts!","First off, I’d like to consider myself a CP Veteran. I’ve been going to the park since 2006. As a Michigan resident this is something I have done multiple times a year since elementary school. I have visited the park at least 50 times and have been on every coaster dozens of times. I know the park inside and out with my eyes closed, I can look at queues and know how long the wait is. I know every bump on every ride, where all the cameras are, I KNOW my Cedar Point.

I’m writing this because I have seen this park change so much over the years. Good and bad things. Pros and cons, from being a small child to now almost 30. Way before fast passes, season passes, food passes, back when you had a physical ticket. When you could pay with cash. Johnnie Rockets. When Michigan resident specials were $30 a ticket. The good ol’ times. Here are my thoughts as an advent park goer. 

I’m happy with how much more strict they have gotten with phones being put away on rides as well as other belongings. 1 for safety and 2 it forces people to be bored and mingle in line. We don’t need to be on our phones.

What I’ve seen people bitch about in here is not holding your group’s spot while someone puts everyone’s belongings in a locker. See I disagree and think it would operate smoother if one person from every group went to the lockers. It would help wait times, the lockers being crowded, and everyone can continue in line the order they started in. I wouldn’t consider this line jumping, as multiple people do this to meet up with their groups and this should definitely be enforced. I attended the park Wednesday 8/27 and had so many small children cut in line on Sirens to meet up with their group/parents. If you are separated from your group meet up outside of the rides. It is not fair to those who wait patiently.

Fast lane passes? Are unnecessary and a waste of money in my opinion. If you go on a week day like my group did, and as I ALWAYS have since I was a child, wait times are NEVER more than an hour, and thats less than what we waited for SV, TT2, Sirens, and Maverick. Raptor and Gatekeeper were walk ons. I see a lot of people complaining about wait times….pick better days to go? You can’t predict how busy the park is going to be, but with common sense, yes weekends are way busier than weekdays. Waiting in line, yes annoying, but it is part of the amusement park experience. Waiting in line for a 1-2 minute thrill. Also, is it really even considered a “fast lane” if soooo many people have them, and STILL have to wait in line? I wish the park disclosed how many they sell per day, because it seems like a lot. Is it 5% of attendance? 10%? 

What is the point of getting a season pass that includes Halloweekends but does not include any Halloweekends attractions? I was never a fan of Halloweekends because of how busy the park is. I wilk not wait 3 hours in line for anything. Now they want to charge people THAT ALREADY PAID $200 FOR A SZN PASS…to do the haunted attractions? I think that is bullshit and another money grab.

I went to the park 4 times this summer and bought a FunPix lanyard to capture everyone’s photos. I’m a little irritated that I paid $65 for this and every time we went, at least 1-2 of the coasters didn’t have the picture kiosk open. 

Also in the 4 times I went this summer, I got to ride Millie ONCE. The other two times it was shut down all day, and the other time only one train was running and it was a 3+ hour wait. Does anyone have updates or insight on this? Whats going on? I know its normal for the rides to experience issues, I’m used to that I’ve been coming here 20 years, there’s been times I’ve been in the seat ready to go and they booted me off for maintenance. But this is SO unlike Millie, 4 visits and 3 times there were issues? Never experienced this in 20 years with this coaster.

The only thing that hasn’t changed in price is the Slingshot. It has always been $20. But everything else just seems like a cash grab now and it’s disappointing. I will always love this place and the coasters, but for what you pay never equals what you get. And thats for anything. Merch, food, fast lane pass, etc. It is impossible for a family to go, enjoy a nice meal, buy a couple nice things maybe a shirt or coffee mug and not spend a fortune. I know its an amusement park and you’re going to pay amusement park prices, but as someone thats been coming here for 20 years, it was affordable at one point. You could enjoy your time and not cringe at the prices. 

Also, tickets should include parking. I know the passes do, but at that point you might as well just get the season pass even if you go one time because it’s $100 anyways for a ticket and to park your car. In 2015, preferred parking used to be $30, its now $54. 

I would like to hear thoughts and comments from other CP enthusiasts that have been coming here longer than I’ve even been alive. You’ve seen the park change so much over the years what are new changes you like or dislike? ",2,1756424816.0,cedarpoint,7,0.63,False

And right here, I get asked constantly: “Do I — or my fellow directors — have to live in Bahrain to set up and run a company?” The answer shapes everything: your business structure, your costs, your speed to market, and your future flexibility.\
For a detailed overview of Bahrain company formation, recommended providers, and official procedures, start here.\
\
Bahrain’s 2025 Business Environment: Why Location Matters\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting. and a June 2025 Reuters report, Bahrain’s projected GDP growth for 2025 is 4.9%, outpacing regional averages. The government’s Vision 2030 programs, the rapid modernization of Bahrain Bay, and major regulatory updates make the Kingdom a magnet for international businesses, tech startups, and Gulf family offices.\
Key stats for 2025:\
- Over 70% of new commercial registrations (CRs) were filed by foreign-owned entities in Q1–Q2 (source: Gulf News)\
- More than BHD 1.2 billion in foreign direct investment projected for Q3 and Q4\
- Bahrain Financial Harbour and Seef District office occupancy rates at over 92%\
What does this mean when you’re appointing directors or choosing your company structure? Let’s cut through the technicalities and get to the answers.\
\
The Residency Requirement: Expert, Practical Answer\
Do Company Directors Need to Be Residents in Bahrain?\
No, Bahrain does not require directors to be residents for most company structures.\
Here’s the breakdown:\
\
\
With WLL (With Limited Liability) Companies and SPC (Single Person Companies): Directors can be non-residents. You and your fellow directors can appoint international board members, live in Dubai, Riyadh, or even London, and still manage your Bahraini entity. (I’ve done this with three different firms. Never set foot in the Kingdom? As long as your paperwork is flawless and you have a reliable local contact, you’re covered.)\
\
\
For BSC (Bahrain Shareholding Companies): Again, directors may be non-residents. However, you must appoint a locally resident manager or authorized signatory who can deal with government departments. MOICT is strict about this for CR renewals and compliance.\
\
\
Exception:\
If you’re applying to specific sectors (like banking or insurance), additional CBB (Central Bank of Bahrain) residency requirements might apply for compliance or regulatory officers.\
\
Tip: Always clarify your sector-specific needs with Bahrain’s EDB.\
\
\
“I once had an international investor panic at the last minute about not being able to fly in for a board meeting. We solved it entirely with a power of attorney and remote document signing — no residency needed, no delays.”\
\
Practical Implication\
\
No need to relocate your directors (or yourself) to Bahrain.\
Cost and admin savings, especially if you’re running a regional holding structure.\
Stay compliant by appointing a Bahrain-resident manager (if your sector or the MOICT process requires it under 2025 regulations).\
\
Check deeper details for each company type here.\
\
2025 Regulatory Changes and Policy Updates\
In February 2025, the MOICT introduced an updated e-signature and “remote onboarding” policy for foreign shareholders and directors. Now, every stage of company formation (including board appointments) can be completed digitally via the Sijilat portal — no embassy visits, no in-person signings except for certain regulated sectors.\
\
Implementation Date: February 14, 2025\
Practical result: Ultra-fast company setup, even if your directors reside abroad.\
\
And, if you’re wondering, the legendary queues at the Diplomatic Area’s CR counter? Largely gone. (Thank Tamkeen’s digitization grants for that.)\
\
Bahrain Company Structures and Ownership: What’s Best?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. and here.\
\
BSC (Closed & Public):\
For larger, capitalized businesses\
Board may be international, but a resident manager is needed for notification and compliance\
\
Sectors like banking or insurance may still require at least one C-level Bahraini resident\
\
\
Branch or Representative Office:\
\
Must have a locally appointed representative\
\
Typically handled via a PRO service or third-party provider\
\
\
Free Zone Company:\
\
Exemptions from VAT, customs, and flexible labor quotas\
No residency for directors required\

\
\
Small tangent: Bahrain’s love of coffee isn’t just hospitality — it’s the unofficial lubricant of business deals. My advice? Invest in a proper coffee machine for your office in Seef, and keep a tray of dates on hand — it’s amazing how quickly bureaucratic processes move after a strong “ghahwa” and a chat about football.\
\
\
Step-by-Step Guidance: Fast, Cost-Effective Registration\
Step 1: Choose Your Legal Structure\
\
WLL, SPC, BSC, Branch, or Free Zone? Your ownership and director residency requirements depend on this.\
\
Step 2: Prepare Documents in Advance\
!(\
- Get all shareholder and director documents notarized and e-stamped before submission — saves 3–7 days.\
- Scan all passports and IDs at 600dpi, color. MOICT rejects poor scans, and you’ll lose your queue slot.\
- Draft your board resolution for remote appointment. Use a template from a reputable company formation service.\
Step 3: Submit via Sijilat\
\
Use the portal for filings.\
Appoint a Bahraini PRO if you want to skip in-person lines entirely — cost is BHD 250–350, often includes annual renewals.\
\
Step 4: Office Lease (If Required)\
\
Seef District and Bahrain Bay have the fastest digital CR address activation.\
I learned this the hard way: avoid off-peak application times right before Ramadan — government hours shorten, and approvals can stall by weeks!\
\
Step 5: Licensing and Activation\
\
Depending on your activity, additional sectoral approvals may be needed.\
Certain sectors require local inspection of office premises. (BSCs and banks, especially.)\
\
\
Cost Considerations: How Much Will It Really Cost in 2025?\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs.\
\
\
Annual CR renewal:\
BHD 50–100 (sector-dependent)\
\
\
Official address rental:\
BHD 500–2,500/year (Seef District is premium, but saves time with digital CR activation)\
\
\
Local POA/PRO service (for non-resident directors):\
BHD 250–400/year (worth every fils if you’re abroad!)\
\
\
Total first-year costs:\
BHD 950–3,500 (excluding sectoral licenses and VAT if applicable)\
\
\
PRO tip: Bundling your address lease and PRO service can save up to 20% — refer to this cost breakdown.\
\
\
Common mistake: Entrepreneurs often underestimate the need for a premium address to avoid red tape. Cheap addresses can stall your Sijilat activation. Go premium for speed — worth every fil.\
\
\
\
Regulatory Compliance for Non-Resident Directors\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation. processes.\
- Maintain a Bahrain-based physical or virtual office address for CR correspondence.\
Best approach: Engage a licensed corporate secretary to handle filings, annual meetings, and board documentation. Try this provider — responsive, cost-effective, and they know exactly how to navigate last-minute requests.\
Insider Compliance Tip\
\
Don’t overlook the annual economic substance filing: Even without local directors, you must submit this with the MOICT, or risk a BHD 2,000+ penalty.\
\
\
Common Challenges (And How I Solved Them)\
\
Problem:\
  Last Eid, I needed a director’s signature yesterday — the director was on holiday in Marbella.\
Solution:\
  Drafted a digital power of attorney, sent via email, and uploaded a notarized copy to Sijilat before noon. Used the MOICT’s new 2025 digital signature approval.\
\
Prevention: Always request a digital POA from all non-resident directors at incorporation. Saves headaches.\
\
\
Problem:\
  Misaligned office address stalled my CR for 10 days.\
\
\
Solution:\
  Shifted to a Seef District virtual office. Approval in 36 hours.\
\
\
Tip:\
  During Ramadan, set all appointments before 10 a.m. Majlis meetings run long — and business hours shorten sharply after noon.\
\
\
\
Bahrain Business Culture: The Unspoken Rules\
\
Dress: Business formal in Diplomatic Area, smart casual in Bahrain Bay’s startup hubs.\
Meetings: Expect calendar invites and ad hoc WhatsApp confirmations. A handshake still matters.\
Coffee: Serving Arabic coffee before starting any negotiation is more than tradition — it’s a trust builder.\
Networking: Relationships with MOICT staff, Tamkeen advisors, and EDB facilitators matter almost as much as paperwork. I’ve “jumped the queue” more than once, just by recognizing an officer from a majlis.\
\
\
Bahrain vs UAE/Saudi Arabia: Company Director Flexibility\
\
Bahrain: Directors do not need to be residents (except for a resident manager in some sectors); 100% foreign ownership is straightforward.\
UAE: Some free zones require resident directors or “visa quota.”\
Saudi Arabia: Historically strict; at least one GCC-resident director for most company types.\
\
Bottom line: Bahrain’s rules are simpler, less costly, and friendlier for regional and international investors — IF you prep your documentation and appoint a trusted local agent.\
\
Choosing the Right Support: Who to Trust?\
\
Alt text: Professional business support in Bahrain. for full-scope company formation — they offer bundled director, PRO, and compliance services at transparent prices (no hidden “documentation” charges, unlike others I’ve used).\
\
FAQ: Minimum Residency for Directors in Bahrain\
1. Can I set up a Bahrain company without ever visiting the Kingdom?\
Yes. All filings now support digital onboarding and e-signature. Use a trusted local PRO and company formation service for compliance and paperwork.\
2. Must my company have a resident director?\
Usually not. Only certain sectors (like banking, insurance) require a resident manager. For WLL/SPC/general businesses, non-resident directors are accepted.\
3. Do I need a local sponsor or partner?\
No for most business activities. 100% foreign ownership is allowed for a wide range of sectors. More info: Foreigner-Friendly Activities, 99% Foreign Ownership.\
4. What are the hidden costs for non-resident directors?\
Main extra cost: local PRO/authorized signatory service, and, if applicable, physical address rental. See detailed cost breakdown.\
5. How do I stay compliant from abroad?\
Appoint a dedicated local secretary or use accounting and compliance services for annual filings, board meetings, and MOICT submissions.\

*By The Sports Oracle with a Side of Sarcasm*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: The Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)**  
Let’s start with the cold, hard cash of statistics. Boise State is the clear favorite here, with decimal odds hovering around **1.8 to 1.87** (implied probability: \~54-55%) across bookmakers like DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM. South Florida, meanwhile, is priced at **1.87 to 1.95**, translating to **49-52%** implied probability. The spread? Boise State is favored by **1.5 points**, a line so narrow it’s like betting on who’ll spill coffee on their bracket first during March Madness.

The total points line sits at **44.5**, with the Over priced slightly lower (1.8–1.91 odds) than the Under (1.87–2.0). This suggests bookmakers expect a moderately high-scoring game, which makes sense: Boise State’s offense is a well-oiled machine, even without Heisman-finalist Ashton Jeanty. Their backups—like redshirt freshman Sire Gaines (110 yards in the opener) and transfer Malik Sherrod—have combined for **1,066 rushing yards and 10 TDs** in 2025. USF’s defense? Well, they’ve allowed an average of **32.4 PPG** in their last four season openers. Let’s just say their defense is like a sieve that’s been upgraded to a colander.

---

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Culture, and a Touch of Drama**  
Boise State’s loss of Ashton Jeanty is akin to losing your favorite pair of Nikes… only to realize you’ve been walking on a treadmill the whole time. Jeanty’s 2,601 rushing yards last season were just 27 shy of Barry Sanders’ NCAA record, but the Broncos aren’t panicking. Coach Spencer Danielson praised Jeanty as “one of the top leaders I’ve ever been around,” but let’s be real: Boise’s culture is built on “game by game, day by day” grit. With Gaines and Sherrod stepping up, this backfield is now the NFL’s version of a “try before you buy” sample pack.

South Florida, meanwhile, is a team stuck in a cursed season-opener loop. They’ve lost four straight openers since 2019, a streak that’s become as reliable

I was looking like a very average unmade up 47 year. I guess I took it because I was not expecting it. I thought it over and decided to text him. I asked him is he trying flirt or did he genuinely mean that about the rides. He asked if we could meet sometime. I mentioned we could go on a walk or grab a coffee or drink sometime. He asked if I wanted to come to his house. I really didn't like the way the conversation was going and I don't think I would have gone but I told him maybe. Then he asked for photos of me. So I blocked him. My question is to the ladies who use Uber and Lyft has this happened to you? What was your experience?

He knew it was OmniStream. The misery he felt wasn't his own; it was a cold, alien sadness that had settled deep in his bones, mirroring the bleak narratives of the shows he'd watched. Desperate and hollowed out, he tried to cancel one last time.
The app didn't freeze this time. Instead, it loaded a new page. A single, sleek interface appeared with a progress bar that was full to the brim. The title above it read: Misery Harvest.
Below the bar was a simple message: ""Thank you for your contribution.""
The screen then showed a pulsing, bioluminescent map of a vast, complex network. It was not a digital grid, but a geological one, burrowing deep beneath the Earth's crust, a spiderweb of tunnels glowing with a sickly green light. The names on the tunnels weren't cities or states, but human emotions: Grief, Despair, Ennui. The streams of human suffering converged on a central point, a pulsating core of pure misery.
Alex felt the last of his energy drain away, an empty husk of a man. The cold, alien sadness was gone, replaced by a final, horrifying realization. OmniStream wasn't a streaming service. It was a parasitic life form that harvested human despair, and he had just provided the final, fatal dose. The screen went dark.
A moment later, it reset to the welcome page, ready for a new subscription.

I mean? Surely people want to have apartments that are above little businesses and coffee shops (like most are in real life), or just be able to rent a place and still run a business. Maybe I'm too European but what the hell else am I meant to do.

I was too overconfident in the thought that this would OBVIOUSLY be something you can do, since the packs are both new and **one of the literal pre-built lots has apartments on top of a business** (the Lodens). But no, they're just faked apartments, it's actually all just one lot.

1n2rqoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kickboxing/comments/1n2rqoj/the_perfect_amateur_training_camp_way_to_cut/,The perfect amateur training camp way to cut weight (as a national level athlete),"A little info about me: Im a 17yo amateur kickboxer, Ive been training kickboxing (and a little bit of boxing) for 4 years 6/7 times per week. Ive got 15 fights, 11W all on national level and have been a member for the national team for two years. My experience isn’t much but I’ve been able to test different ways of cutting weight and I concluded to a single way which is not really enjoyable but at least it works!

First of all, you are an amateur so you shouldn’t really care about cutting weight HOWEVER it’s really helpful and effective to fight in lower weight categories and if you are looking forward to compete in lots of fights, cutting weight will always give you an advantage if done correctly. A single mistake can cost your fight so don’t go doing extreme weight cuts by yourself!

Note: I am not a dietitian nor an expert, I’m just sharing what has worked for me and hopefully it could really help other amateurs as well! 

Now let’s get started
Your weight cuts should NOT last longer than 2-3 weeks. Mine last about 2 weeks and I manage to drop almost 7kgs without cutting water. That is really important cause that means you can go even further without destroying your organism.
My two week diet was almost everyday the same thing except for the fact that my water intake was being reduced from 4-5L to 500mL. 

Week 1: 
Breakfast was always: 80-100g greek yogurt with a tsp of honey, less than 6 blueberries and max 10 almonds. 
This breakfast provides barely the energy your body needs for your training sessions. 
Lunch & Dinner: these two meals are always gonna be the same. 200g chicken breast / 200g salmon. These are the only two foods you get to eat. Chicken breast is not optional, while salmon is. If you don’t like salmon just eat 200g more of chicken breast for the extra protein. So just to sum it up you get to eat 400g of food. 200g of them should always be chicken breast and the rest could be either chicken breast again or salmon. 
Important rules for Week 1: 
Eat zero carbs, and zero salt, stick to these three meals along with your training
If you really need carbs you can eat 2 rice cakes or 80g rice
in case you are not training skip breakfast
Drink 4-5L of water per day but DONT CHUG IT , that’s really important we really want you to go peeing every five minutes lol.
You must drink only water. The only liquid that you are allowed to drink only at Week 1 is black coffee without any sugar
Week 2: 
This is fight week. Lets say you’re fighting on Sunday. 
Meals are gonna stay the same except for breakfast. I most of the times stop eating the blueberries and limit almonds to max 5, keep the tsp of honey though. Strictly don’t eat any carbs/salt/fruits/juices etc. 
From Monday to Saturday you want to drop you water intake from 4-5L to 500mL. Make sure the last sip of water is at 6pm no matter what. If you get really thirsty you are allowed to drink just a few really small sips but I wouldn’t recommend that. 
On fight day (Sunday in this hypothetical scenario) make sure to both pee and take a dump at the morning and an hour before the weight in. 

This exact plan helped me cut from 72kg to 65kg for a fight without any water cuts. I’ll now give you general tips for water cutting and refuelling after the weigh in.

General tips:
Water cut:
1) make sure to buy a sauna suit (it really helps) 
2) lot’s of shadowboxing, skipping, and running but try not to get fatigued on your legs
3) on top of the sauna suit wear as many warm clothes as you can (double socks, two pants, hoodies, jackets, beanies etc) so you can sweat even more
4) start the process just one day before the weigh in and stop when you reach the desired weight. After that dont drink more than 250-500mL so you can easily lose them the next day. (Im recommending that just so because during the weigh in day, cutting your last weight shouldn’t be on your mind and make you extra stressed) 


Refuelling post weigh in. 
EAT
The way you eat depends on your fight. 
If it’s a same day weigh in I would recommend:
A sandwich with cheese and ham and anything else you put in, 2 boiled eggs, cookies or something full of carbs, fats and sugar, and electrolytes. These are some easy to pack foods so you can have them in your bag regardless of were you’re fighting.

If the fight is on the next day:
First of all hydrate by drinking electrolytes and have maybe an egg or smth of the before mentioned snacks with you. Go find and Italian or just a random restaurant and eat PASTA. Choose your favorite plate it doesn’t matter, your body needs the calories, carbs and anything else it provides. 


Small adjustment:
If you cut for 3 Weeks instead of two. You are allowed to eat up to 100g of carbs at Week 1. Up to 80g at start of Week 2 and by the end of Week 2 just 50g. During fight week don’t even bother eating.

I wouldn’t recommend cutting water with this plan as it will already help you cut up to 10kgs. You’re not getting paid so there is no reason to cut more than 10kg. Even a 5kg cut is too much but you who am I to judge (I cut weight for the love of the game) 

You won’t feel like you’ve got any energy at all. In fact you will feel like your body is collapsing because of the lack of salt and carbs. Your body will start burning fat for energy and since you’re not used to it it will feel really weird. 
Yes it will be hard to do this along your training camp (Ive posted a training camp guide as well so check it out) but this sport isn’t for the faint hearted anyways! 

I hope this plan will help, if not try to work around this and find the perfect way for you, as preparation is different for everyone

Last week, after completely zoning out while doomscrolling, I randomly stumbled upon an *ad* (yes, one of those annoying ones) for **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. Skeptical? Um, absolutely. But I clicked anyway. AND THANK GOODNESS I DID.

Fast forward 7 days and my PayPal account is a WHOLE $100 fatter. All I did? Test some apps. From my phone. In MY bed. While watching Stranger Things reruns, lmao.

Here's what happened (buckle up, you won't believe this):

- I signed up at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (no weird credit card traps, no ""trial periods"" that secretly charge you, just straight up email + some quick questions about my device).
- Literal minutes after, I had a list of apps to download and test. We’re talking games, fitness trackers, even a budgeting app.
- Everything works from your phone. Like—fully mobile. I didn’t touch my laptop ONCE.
- For each app, there’s a checklist: open the app, use it normally (sometimes complete a small task, like reaching Level 2 in a game or syncing steps on a fitness tracker). Takes 5–20 mins each, MAX.
- Most apps paid $3–$10 to test. The budgeting one paid $15 because I had to give “extra feedback.”
- No surveys, no three-hour marathons, no trapping me in junky paywalls. THANK YOU, UNIVERSE.

You might be wondering: *Is this a scam?*  
Trust issues? ME TOO. But… **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** actually paid me. Three little PayPal transfers throughout the week, balance hit $100.10 exactly. (I may have yelled.)

My BIGGEST shocks:

- Easiest sidecash I’ve ever pulled in.
- It does NOT eat up your day. I did most while waiting for coffee to brew.
- You don’t need some fancy phone—a halfway decent Android or iPhone is fine.
- Some apps are pretty fun. I legit found a new puzzle game addiction thanks to this.
- They *remind* you to submit feedback, but don’t harass you every hour.

But also: my FOMO is on full blast right now. I could've been doing this ages ago if I'd known. It’s wild how *hidden* these things can be, but clearly, **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** isn’t just hype for the sake of clicks.

A few tips if you're tempted:

- Don’t ignore the feedback steps! Most apps require a short thought about your experience (you don’t have to write a novel, but don’t phone it in either).
- Rotate your apps. The more you try, the faster your total grows.
- Have notifications ON. The juicy, high-paying opportunities go FAST, and you want dibs.
- Watch out—some apps only work in certain regions, but **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** tells you up front.

Seriously: WHO KNEW you could make solid, 3-figure cash for test-driving random apps while chilling at home?  

My mind is still blown. If you’ve been hustling side gigs and getting nowhere, give **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** a try. No big promises, just real results—like, actual money for actual humans.  

Did anyone else fall into this goldmine? Did I just get really lucky? Drop your wins (or fails!) below—let’s spill on what’s working.

Blown. 💥 Get Paid REAL Cash Testing Secret Apps—No Skills, Just Your Phone!","Guys… what even is real life anymore??!? Last night, I was doomscrolling, like always, and I just found out you can actually get paid to TEST out brand new apps before anyone else. No tech degrees. No “5 years experience.” Just you, your phone, and—wait for it—real cash. 💸💸

Honestly, my brain can’t process this. Imagine: you, chilling on the couch, trying out a game or a social app, and getting MONEY for your opinion?? This isn’t some scammy scheme. Legit, people all over are making side cash and not even coding a single line.

Here’s how anyone (YES, even my grandma could do this) can get started testing apps for real money with zero experience:

- **Sign up for beta tester gigs using portals like this 👉 [https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp).**
- Get quick screening questions (mostly stuff like “Do you have an Android/iPhone?” and “Can you use apps?” Um, obviously).
- Wait to get picked—sometimes it’s instant, sometimes takes a bit.
- They hand you simple tasks, like downloading an app, playing around, or finding bugs.
- Give your feedback and get PAID.

Still can’t believe it? Here’s what’s tripping me out:

- **You don’t need any fancy tech knowledge.**
- The apps you test can be wild – from games that aren’t released yet to finance or health trackers that wanna beat the competition.
- Payouts range from $5 for simple play tests to much higher for detailed feedback. Multiply that by a few apps a week?? CHA-CHING!
- **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** is popping up everywhere as a trusted spot. And yes, they are PAYING.

Not even kidding—I tried it and woke up to a small payment in my account. Easiest coffee run cash ever.

So, what’s the catch??? I kept thinking there’d be one. Truth bomb: Some tests fill up fast if you wait. So you gotta be a little proactive, but no biggie.

In case anyone still thinks this isn’t for them, let me ask:

- Want side income without leaving your room?
- Enjoy critiquing things (“Wow. Another pop-up? Really??”)??
- Like trying out new things before your friends even know about them?

If ANY of those made you go “yep, that’s me,” you need to bookmark **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** TODAY. You can thank me when you buy your new headphones with lazy-day app tester cash.

Final bits of advice for total beginners:

- Use a clean email just for app testing (keep your inbox manageable!).
- Actually check notifications—some beta invites close FAST.
- Be honest in your feedback. Developers want real opinions, not sugarcoated reviews.

My honest verdict: If someone had told me last week that you could literally earn money just by testing apps, I’d have called them delusional. But no… it’s REAL.

So stop scrolling, click over to **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**, and tell me if your mind isn’t equally blown after your first payout. Are we ALL tech influencers now?! 🤯💸

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements (about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However, the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days, and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

• During plasmapheresis, blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do. Donor identification systems are in place to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by your overall diet over several days, not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited, it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as it can dehydrate you.

5. No strenuous exercise for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure. Most centers recommend avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

7. If your pulse rate is above 100, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate, the box breathing technique may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to heal and repair your veins via normal tissue healing.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait at least a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating to reduce bleeding and bruising risks.

• You can use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased immunoglobulin levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein nutrients found in plasma.

• Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess. Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, you must be healthy when you donate and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is highly encouraged for all donors.

I’m brand new to the world of proper tea, my doctor recommended I cut coffee because of reflux, so about a month ago I figured why not dive into something new?

Fast-forwarding to today, a supplier at work (I’m in tech) gifted me a really sleek box of Jin Jun Mei black tea, my first real Chinese tea. Brewed it according to the label and... honestly? It’s naturally sweet, smooth, rich, like dessert in a cup without being too sugary.

While sipping it, I did a quick search and found the Wikipedia page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin\_Jun\_Mei\_tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Jun_Mei_tea) and something strange (to me, at least) was written there:

>The tea has a sweet taste and is very resistant to brewing. It can be brewed 12 times and the taste remains full and sweet.

TWELVE?! As in... one-two? Like, 12 separate infusions from the same leaves??

I’ve re-steeped herbal stuff once or twice in the past, but this level of endurance is new to me. Is this real? How do you store leaves between steeps? Do you just keep going throughout the day, or refrigerate them for later?

Anyway, I didn’t expect to enjoy this journey so quickly. Sorry for not revealing the supplier brand name on the box photo for privacy reasons, but I’m seriously impressed. Looking forward to exploring more teas and learning the ways of the leaf!

Chapter 1.  I won’t break. I can’t break.

The sting of his leather belt across her back as it wrapped around the curve of her ribs caused her breath to catch in her tightened chest. When his booted foot made contact with the other side of her chest, the immediate pain of a broken rib made being out of breath an instant before nothing more than an agonizing memory. A second kick knocked her completely on to her side trapping her arm beneath her. The belt fell quickly in rapid succession across her legs and torso. The elevated violence and brutality had only one redeeming characteristic, it had made her numb. They had removed the concept of agony and had replaced it with the other singular motive for life to endure: survival. The coppery smell of blood against a roughly pebbled floor mingled freely with the rage, pheromones, and sweat. When the belt struck her face, the stinging blow left behind a wide, bloody welt that had begun to slowly ooze blood. For whatever reason, the next kick made contact with her abdomen and instinctively her body curled itself inwardly into a tiny ball. Her legs had been pulled inwards tightly against her stomach while her arms attempted to cover her head and face. When he finally realized he had marked her face with his belt, he stood over her and spat at her.

“So satisfying. So enlivening”, she said.

Spitting on her one last time, he turned around and walked out, slamming the door behind him.

Valerie?

Valerie?

At some point in the beating, she had drifted off into a level of unconsciousness that dulled pain enough to allow her mind to escape. When she was finally able to regain enough lucidity to hear voices, she had no clear idea how much time had passed, but it felt like a short time to her pain-wracked body. In fact, she had lain there for over ten hours while her body had tried to recover and judging from the pain levels, it hadn’t been much. 

“Valerie, Sir Dominic has ordered you to clean the third floor. All of it”.

Her eyes forced themselves to open to see Janice standing carefully over her. The diminutive girl was only a waif-like thirteen year old. She was one of many lower servants from the Omega house.

Valerie rolled onto her legs and with as much power as she could muster, she raised herself up until one leg was raised up to allow her to stand. She knew that Janice would not help her. That was part of the rules. Helping another servant would earn you the same beating, regardless of age or gender.

The walls of her room seemed to waver as she reached towards the small wood framed bed before her hand was able to get a good enough grip to allow her to pull herself up onto her feet. She definitely felt a bit wobbly, but her breathing was slightly less painful when she inhaled than before. 

Her eyes moved to Janice and she able to focus enough to realize the girl had also recently been beaten although the bruises had begun to become yellowish. 

“Thank you, Janice. I’ll go now”.

With that, Janice backed out of the room and beat a hasty retreat towards the long hallway ending in a weather worn stairwell. Her pace had not been a slow one, which meant she was on her way to report to Sir Dominic. 

There was no mirror in her room, so she had no way of knowing that the belt had left a violently red stripe across the left side of her face. The welt left behind felt swollen and raised up to her fingertips. She’d survived, again. One more beating. More to come. She winced as her ribs reminded her at that exact moment, that the beatings were not as easily recovered from as they had been once. Now although only 25 years old, her body bore the cumulative weight of many years of abuse. It was her life. It was her Hell. It had become all she expected of life. Over and over. 

Alex awoke with the sheen of sweat on his skin, the sheets were clammy and bunched into tight knots as if they had been twisted by hands into chokeholds. The sun had barely broken the horizon’s edge but the limited light felt ablaze to him. The pupils of his eyes narrowed until they were mere dots in a landscape of blue-green eye color. He raised himself up before noticing that his room looked as if a tornado had ripped through it. Papers, pillows, leftover glasses were all knocked over or askew. Nothing seemed to have escaped the torments he’d dreamt of last night. This was the fifth he’d suffered through. He had found no way of extracting any kind of meaning or symbology. Anything like that was somehow purposefully elusive. Dammit, it wasn’t even close. It was irritating and it was making an anger inside of him feed itself like a runaway forest fire and without the sense of accomplishment that even a forest fire leaves behind, growth after destruction. 

The knock at the door sounded much louder than he was expecting which meant one of two things, either he’d had too much to drink the night before or his pain in the butt brother, Jim was ready to start needling him again about his leadership role, rights and responsibilities. He glanced at the decanter of Woodford Reserve Bourbon. It was hardly touched, so drinking too much was out of the question, but now sounded like a great idea. 

“Are you going to say come in? Or am I going to have to knock until I wear a hole in the door? You know I am not always as careful as needed when I start using too much strength”.

“Okay, come in already”.

“Good morning, Big Brother”.  Jim’s gaze immediately registered the destroyed room and the overpowers scent of male perspiration with a hinted trace of anger. Oh yes, if you have the nose for it, you can definitely smell anger, to be honest it always reminded him of black licorice. Yuck!

“One of those kind of nights, eh?”?

“Hardly. This was at a subconscious level. What the hell is going on inside my head”?

“Is this the third time”?

“No, the fifth, if you don’t count the times I keep zoning out without even realizing it”.

“Was there anything that caught you can actually remember about it? Sometimes, even small details can have big meanings”.

“I’m not sure of anything. I think, or at least I think I remember the fragment of a name, but it has no meaning as if it was just sliced into pieces by a sharp knife”. Alex stepped onto the rug by his bedside. It’s forceful gold and silver emblem in stark contrast to his jumbled state of mind. 

“Well, are you going to just stand by your bed all day or are you going to tell me what you remember”?

“It’s nothing specific. Just like a sound. I think it sounded like ‘Za’. What could that mean?”?

“‘Za’. That’s it? Wow, for the leader of our territory, you aren’t showing any high degree of mental alacrity”.

Alex allowed the slightest grumble to escape his throat before realizing he’d never get anywhere by acting macho with his brother who didn’t give a damn about any of that kind of thing. Period! He reached across the room to grab his pants and his shirt. It was a dark, navy blue turtleneck that he felt made him look good and was comfortable to wear. 

“By the way, they’re here.”

“Damn”.

Chapter 2. Altered Stages

The necklace hung around Naomi’s throat with grace. The many gems it held shone brilliantly reflecting the bright light of the room into hundreds of tiny prismatic rainbows shaped like pointed spheres. The hues of red, green, blue and purple all shining forth as if demanding the gathered crowd to acknowledge her position. A position she knew she held only through strength and, if she admitted it, guile. Something that didn’t bother her in the least. 

Looking down at her outfit, with its brocaded fabric of pale cream she couldn’t help but notice that one of the shoes she’d worn last night as she had accompanied Sir Dominic had somehow managed to be stained with she could smell was now dried blood. How stupid of the servant to dirty her shoes. She’d have to tell Dominic that the girl deserved another beating for being so careless as to allow her blood to splatter so far away. Yes, definitely the thing to do. She bent over, picked up the shoes and casually tossed them into the trash. As she glanced down at them for the last time, her tongue glided across her lips with a lingering desire. Pain could be so sensual. 

The dining area was filled with the inner circle of people that helped run the lives of the members. She refused to call them a ‘pack’ simply because she saw herself above such class distinctions. Oh they were useful and perhaps even necessary for some things, but form, fit and function were only adjacent items to her own responsibilities. She made money and because she made money, this pack was a regional powerhouse. They were influencers. They were the epitome of success. Sure, there were those who saw them as just another relatively successful band or even those who saw them as nothing more than obstructions. None of them saw them as weak. None of them mattered. Or maybe just a few mattered. 

Serena walked in with her posse as if she’d been exposed to non-stop torment while the reality was nothing more than she had woken up with a minor headache and a turbulent tummy from having tried to drink without restraint and eating without concern. Something that wasn’t always possible. She plopped into a cushioned chair and snapped her fingers to demand her morning latte. Hot, spices added and a hint of honey. 

Her mother had only arrived shortly before she had walked in, so she was still busy playing the dramatic queen. She played the part well. Their past life in another territory hundreds of miles away was just a now forgotten glimpse of a troubled life filled with deprivation and desire. The hunger pangs that had once been her tormentor still lived rent free in her mind. They wouldn’t go away. They probably never would. 

Lilly and Amber sat across from her, they were identical twins and were both equally vacuous. Each competed against the other for the rights to claim ownership of anything and anyone. That was fine with her as long as they knew their place. There were several other territories with very eligible leaders. They were off limits. She’d had to remind them physically of that a few times. Second tier, third tier or below were where they could do their playing, but never above. Clouds. Twin clouds.

“We are expecting guests today, Serena. You seem to be carelessly under-dressed. My standards are not so relaxed as yours”.

“I have already heard that, Mother, but nobody is expected before late afternoon. Surely you realize I can dress myself much quicker than yourself”?

Serena’s eyes and tone hinted at the rebellious spirit she knew her daughter possessed and she could have let the comment pass without a thought but balance was always necessary whether dealing with adolescents, rivals or even daughters. 

“Marvelous, then I will expect you to present yourself to me before my breakfast has been served.” With that, she turned away and made her way to where Dominic sat looking at her with suppressed desires radiating from his eyes. She slowed her pace slightly knowing that her scent and her perfumes would only increase his fervor. Power.

Chapter 3. Tribes

Four men exited the large SUV with a precision more akin to military expertise than what one would expect from a dignitary on a first and supposedly social visit. Their eyes quickly scanned the surroundings, noting their expecting hosts and turned out coterie. Only when they had completed this first scan did the doors of the second SUV open. 

Alex stepped out of the car with the commanding charisma level of a king. His eyes turning directly towards his host, Sir Dominic and his lady, Naomi. They both wore matching outfits that were emblazoned with their own signet, a floating sword pointing upwards and adorned with white wings. Below the hilt, he read the phrase embroidered there: ‘Potentia en Motus’.

So much for understatement. He took several steps toward his host as Sir Dominic did the same, extending his hand forward.

“Welcome to Majestic Skies, Prime Alex. 

You do us a great honor. Allow me to introduce Lady Naomi, our Luna legate”.

She extended her hand and he took it before  placing a quick touch of his lips to her hand accompanied by a slight bow.

“The pleasure is mine, Sir Dominic. I can see with my own eyes just how well you embody your signet”.

“Please, allow me to escort you into our home. We have prepared a light repast for you and your staff before you will be shown to your suite. Your second is of course welcome to join us as my second, Eduardo will gladly take this opportunity to add to his own knowledge about how such a forceful and ambitious territory has made such tremendous strides towards their growth”.

Sir Dominic and Lady Naomi turned and began to ascend the remaining few steps before the doorway. Standing to the right hand side, Lady Naomi turned towards him and stated. Our daughter, Serena, Prime Alex. Serena did her best interpretation of a curtesy (albeit an unpracticed one). 

After they had entered the foyer, he noted that she had taken up position two paces behind and to his left, interestingly enough the position usually was only accorded to the Prime’s wife or fiancee. His eyebrow arched itself momentarily but not before noting the look of displeasure crossing the face of his brother. Odd, he’d believed that was one of the main reasons that Jim had encouraged these visits.

Either way, Jim was almost certain to give him an earful about it later. He wondered if Alyson had given him her instructions and if he’d even listened to them. 

Chapter 4. In memory do dreams reside

Valerie sagged into the worm mattress of her bed.  The pain from her broken ribs made lying on either side too painful to tolerate for long and her breathing became coarse and raspy. By sitting up against the wall that served as her headboard, she was able to dull the ache enough to let her breathing even out. It took her six hours to completely clean the third floor and that only because she had several people walk in, do whatever they came to do (without regard to anyone trying to clean up) and then leave. The Lady Naomi had taken a few steps inside the room before she muttered to herself that it was at least acceptable. Valerie took some solace from the comment even if she had not been the one it had been made to. 

Despite having slept for almost ten hours, her body kept trying to tell her that another ten hours of sleep wouldn’t hurt. As if. The temperature in the room she stayed in was generally pretty comfortable, but because it was the last month of summer, it had become stifling at times. With difficulty, she reached over her head to grab the blouse she was required to wear. Plain white, sturdy cotton, faded into a creamy grey by grime, sweat and tears. Still, it was a tight fitting shirt and it did a great job of retaining body heat. Great for winters, but certainly not in August.

She managed to get it off after several twinges of pain, but it left her with nothing but a tattered bra that was several sizes too large for her. She hated it, but going without one around the family was a terrible idea that would only lead to things worse than even heavy beatings.

Too tired to have noticed after she’d walked into her room, she groaned to find that her meager rations of food had not been left inside her doorway. She’d already eaten the last piece of hard cheese and bread that she had pilfered from the plates leftover after yesterday’s evening meal. Having taken a beating last night, there had been zero opportunity to eat breakfast even if she could have found something to eat. She’d been able to refill her water pitcher earlier that afternoon so at least she had something to drink.

When her head dipped towards her chest, the fear came roaring back and her mind withdrew into the safer, darker recesses she used when getting beaten. The surprise of knowing she had only just nodded off was almost enough to cause a smile to appear. Almost. 

Her stomach had found itself tied in knots, so she took a large drink of water, hoping it would calm it down enough to fend off the hunger she felt. 

Serena kept her smile glued to her face and when she was asked a question or was perhaps expected to make a comment, she made sure to phrase everything in a soft, neutral tone devoid of malice, anger and even boredom. Prime Alex was everything they said about him. He had an animal magnetism to him and although he would not be described as having Hollywood looks, his naturally rugged appearance was good enough to qualify him as eye candy. His demeanor was charming and he spoke with an even tone that seemed to invite others to jabber on and on. Personally, she found his monotone ramblings to be somewhat boring. The kind of boring a lot of women get by watching some muscle bound birdbrain flex his biceps. 

The shrewd and sharp glares she’d noticed from her mother were enough to start a fire, so she pretended to be the vapid and insipid type of woman that always seems to attract primes. Empty headed, big breasts and little personality. 

Altogether, she was so looking forward to this pleasant evening. <Sigh>.

Chapter 5. Vision

The weakness never dissipated for long. What she saw was a patchwork of greys, blacks and whites. In her world, color was useless. It was a simple metaphysical construct intended to evoke emotions. When you can’t feel, what good are emotions? Anger, pain, sadness, love or worse yet, hope. They lived within the borders of color where maybe the meanings they labeled meant something. A lot of something’s to a lot of different shapes. Only one such shape mattered to her and she was biteless, toothless and utterly incapable of doing anything more than hiding within a battered frame. Even one as strong as she possessed, could not be reinforced over and over without respite. Her shape was broken in many places, like triangles connected across squares, diamonds, and ovals. The lines failed to adhere to each other with every loss she felt, with every day where her thoughts turned against herself. 

Her matted hair was soiled by the filth she was forced to remain inside. She would have shriven the world itself to help her even though she lacked the power to do so. She would never accept or understand that what Zara could see was worse than anything being inside the mortal cage could impose. She had felt her. She couldn’t have imagined something as crucial as that. It wasn’t possible that she could have made that huge of a mistake. No! She had not. She couldn’t prove it to herself yet. Yet.

Zara felt it all and could do nothing. Her voice silenced in the depths of pain and suffering inflicted by her clan. Where the strength of the many becomes the torment of the few. Where value is not recognized nor appreciated. The pack could never understand the forces behind this. It was anathema to them. It violated the core concepts of identity. The old chose to lead the pack into dangerous territories not because it was their fate to die so others would have time to attack but rather because they still valued their purpose, their  changing identity as time passed. Nobel gestures or futile beliefs held no meaning there. It is what it must be. Time decided all things.

She knew her voice had not carried far as she lay with her arms covering her head and her body twisted into its smallest version of herself. She’d used up every ounce of energy he had left at that time to scream out her own name in the small hope that one who might be listening would hear the plea. It apparently hadn’t worked, but she’d keep doing it. One day there would be ears that could listen nearby.

Valerie was startled awake by the grip that pulled her forcefully off of her bed. The sound of her hips hitting the flooring making a muffled bang. The hand that gripped her arm had its nails embedded into her flesh enough to cause it to bleed. Curiously, there was little to no pain and as the thought passed through her mind, she would have to remember to think that one through later. When her body was close enough to the door, she was grabbed by the top of her shirt and dragged out into the hallway where she saw the other servants standing in fear against the walls. Being pulled to her feet also, she was unceremoniously shoved into the wall close to the others. 

Two guardians stood quietly near the stairway exit and kept their eyes moving across each and every one of them, as if expecting them to attack them physically. 

“Tell him they’re ready”.

Sir Dominic appeared at the end of the stairway and spoke briefly to his body guardians. They both nodded in agreement to whatever had been said. 

“Well it would seem as if we have a traitor amongst us. How deeply troubling. Did you really believe we would be so stupid as to trust any of you? How naive”.

He had walked slowly down the hallway passing close to the huddled staff when suddenly his arm reached out to grab a hold of a young woman in a housemaids outfit. I really couldn’t remember her name, if I even ever knew it, but the terror in her eyes was real enough. With the characteristic strength of a Prime, he threw her without hesitation towards his guardians. Instantly, the one on the left grabbed her, and with a strong twisting motion, snapped her neck. When he released his hold on her body it fell quickly to the floor leaving only a mass of tangled limbs where only seconds before a young woman had existed.

“Potentia en Motus”. Turning away rapidly, he descended the stairway followed shortly after by his guardians. The girl’s body was left behind with her face contorted in terror.

Chapter 6. Infiltrated

Dominic Prime sat pensively in his office while soft cello music played in the background. As calming as the music usually was to him, today it felt like thorns. His seconds, during a search of her room had already discovered her allegiance was to the Calm Winds territory. Not unsurprising really. They had lost significant members to a variant of Sarcoptic Mange. The question was simply why they had tried this careless attempt? Was this a clumsy effort to poach his pack or was a prelude to a more serious move? Their territory was over three days shifted travel away, not inconsiderable distance. 

“Eduardo, double the outer patrols. Order them to remain — inconspicuous. Have the routine patrols follow their standard procedures, but alert them to our increased levels. Let’s see if we can appear to be a more ‘inviting’ territory.

“Immediately, Prime”.

Valerie and Janice struggled to hold the arms and legs of the young woman, Melanie, she’d been told was her name, down the six flights of stairs. Although she was a petite girl, both Janice and herself had been deprived of enough sustenance to support high levels of physical exertion. They were fortunate to find a wheelbarrow close to the garden that they were able to carry the body away from the main house and a little way into the surrounding woods. They had no tools to dig even a small hole, so they settled for a slight dip in the ground and spread some littered branches and leaves on top of her body. There were no words that could be said, she had been there one moment and the next she was part of the trees and the land. Both of them took one final glance down, turned around, pushed the wheelbarrow back to where it had been before, and returned to their floor. 

For whatever reason, her food had been left inside her door. It was more than she’d expected, so she sent a quiet thank you for her bounty. Sir Dominic’s strict rules on pilfering meant no one would dare steal another’s food unless they were prepared for a severe beating and weeks of starvation. She could tell by the simple variety of things left, that much of it was the remainder of the previous evening’s welcoming dinner. There was even a medium sized piece of beef with the remnants of a gravy. The food would allow her body to heal itself at least a little faster, she hoped. Zara sensed the nutrients as they entered her bloodstream and it was enough to provide enough energy to send a thought: Beware.

For the first time in a long time, Valerie was awake and alert when the voice echoed in her mind. One word. ‘Beware’. Pretty anticlimactic given she half believed she’d heard anything at all, but that word felt different somehow as if any thought to create it in her mind hadn’t been her doing. Pretty absurd, really, and even if by some freak act of her imagination, what was that word supposed to mean? Living inside the Majestic Skies territory made living in a constant state of heightened anxiety a normal thing. Attempting to even guess at what this meant was meaningless, at least for now. Without even realizing what she had done, she smiled at how silly she was being. She had answered herself: Okay.

That’s when things got worse. 

A guardian pushed her door open forcefully enough that it slammed right back at him. She had barely enough time to stand up before he was shoving her through the door. Grabbing her by the elbow he forcibly dragged her to Lady Naomi’s office. His hold on her never let go.

She sat on a regal blue chaise lounge with a porcelain china teacup in her left hand. Her eyes were cold and distant. They were dull grayish in the low, warm lighting. 

“As much as I have enjoyed our time together, I am gifting you to the Calm Winds territory. You will serve at their whim”.

She had the time to glance around before a second person in the room stepped up close to her back. The touch of a scalpel slicing through her flesh at the side of her shoulder blade made her cry out in pain, but the guardian held on tightly to her preventing her from moving. Behind her, the pack Doctor withdrew a small, silver disk about the size of a dime was placed inside the folded cut. With a piece of surgical tape and a small piece of gauze, he covered the incision. 

“This will scab and heal over within a week. Keep it dry”.

Lady Naomi beckoned him to leave before telling her that she was expected to walk the compounds of Calm Winds as soon as she had the first opportunity. 

“If you fail at this, I will eagerly suggest to them that you respond well to beatings, perhaps even enjoyed them, before I tell them that you were sent in error and that I absolutely must have you returned to me. I can’t begin to tell you how much that would please me”.

“Oh, I must not forget your parting gift that Dominic was so eager to give to you”. With a nod of her head, she calmly told the guardian to break her left arm.



Chapter 7.  Delivered

Her arm hung loosely wrapped in a rag they had used for cleaning. Fortunately, it has been long enough to allow her to wrap one end around her wrist and the other around her neck. It was a crude piece of work, but it was functional even if there was nothing actually protecting the arm itself. There had already been a few hard bumps. The delivery truck she was riding in had a small bench along one side that mostly held boxes. What was inside was anybody’s guess, but they were pretty solid and didn’t slide too easily. The driver completely ignored her. Still, they were having to travel a good distance, so he eventually stopped to grab a coffee and use the bathroom. He made sure to tell her to stay inside the vehicle by order of Sir Dominic. He had at least given her a bottle of water. The stop hadn’t lasted very long, so they were back on the road with more jostling than before. It felt like they had taken a different road altogether. One particular bump made her frame jump into the air for a couple of seconds resulting in her arm hitting the box beside her hard enough to make her cry out. The driver turned his head around and just said “Better hold on”.

The lodge sat back amongst a partially shaved rocky escarpment. It descended swiftly towards the ground the house sat within but the tapering occurred in such a way as to make it seem as if it flowed into and maybe even through the headquarters building of the Calm Winds territory. The miniature cliff face allowed the wind to flow smoothly around the entirety of the lodge. It had a roughly cut scenic allure, yet it felt eerily depressing. Its view had overseen too much sorrow.

When the car pulled into the oval driveway, he wasted no time in opening the sliding panel door before telling me to jump out. He grabbed the small, soiled laundry bag she’d been told to use to collect her few meagre belongings. A minute or so later, a female guardian came out the lodge main door and approached them. She wore a look of completely focused intent. Valerie lowered her head, but not before recognizing boredom and indifference in her eyes.

“You’re earlier than you should be.”

“Yeah, sorry about that, but she, nodding at her over his shoulder, wanted me to hurry.”

Such a crude attempt at lying was simply too stupid to justify a response. 

“Very well, please let Lady Naomi know that her gift has been received and that she will be well cared for”.

Without glancing at her, he slid the panel door closed, climbed back into the vehicle and was leaving the driveway before Valerie had even dared to raise her eyes.

“Hmmm, not much to you, is there”? Once again the lodge door opened and two muscled men stepped through.

“Take her to the hole. She’ll stay there until Prime Albert can decide what he wants done with her”. They nodded together accepting their roles without a word being spoken.

“You’ll go with them. Give them no reason to tell me you disobeyed”.

Valerie made no verbal response, but inclined her head further down submissively. When her guardians motioned her a certain direction, she mutely walked forward, silently preparing herself for any treatment she might be given. Not that she expected it to be different from any other kind she was accustomed to receiving. 

The ‘Hole’ was simply a sparse room with a small, wooden framed cot with a canvas support. It had a pillow and a blanket, which had her on the verge of tears. Additionally, there was even a wooden chair. She didn’t notice any light, but sunlight through a window above her made it seem like darkness was no longer a concern. A slight sensation of air flowing by could also be felt, probably because of the one inch gap at the bottom of the door. Such foolish thoughts, she silently reminded herself. Still, considering where she’d come from, it was so much more than she had expected that when they closed the door and she could hear them walking away, curiosity conquered fear, at least for the moment. 

Taking a cautious approach, she slowly lowered herself onto the cot. The wooden frame groaned as her weight settled onto it, eventually becoming a firm but stable platform. When she lay down, it felt as if it was designed to hold on tightly to its occupant. Holding her broken left arm tucked against her side, she was finally able to wiggle in enough to be if not comfortable, at least secure. The pillow added a luxurious touch and the blanket although of moderate weight were the things of dreams. Kicking off her worn shoes and covering herself up, sleep came easily. The dreams though were costly. Those were filled with pain and torment. Situation normal. 

It was hunger that finally managed to end them. She had not realized that someone had been inside the ‘Hole’ with her until she saw the wooden plate of food near the door. On the plate, she was given a bowl of what she thought was stew, a piece of bread and an orange, while a wooden spoon completed her serving. This was more food than she usually was given in three days. For a quick moment, she offered thanks to the gods, but somewhere near the demons waited.

The sunlight of the day had dimmed enough for her to know that it would soon be dark and without any light, she would just have to make do with the glow of the moon coming in from the opaque window high up in the ceiling. She noticed a couple of curious things also embedded in the corners of the room toward the hallway. They looked like opaque pieces of glass, they seemed pretty to her but held her interest for just those few seconds.  It was only later after the sun had set that the glass began to radiate a soft bluish light. Not enough to brighten the room, but both of them working together gave off enough light that she could easily discern the shapes and locations of the bed and chair. A wooden framework sat in the corner as a toilet. An iron ring extended out from the wall. After taking the time to relieve herself, she grasped the ring and pulled it towards herself. When she did, a deluge of water carried away the waste. What was this magical world she’d been sent to and what tremendous price would be exacted?

“She’s a spy, of course. Leave her in the Hole for the time being. I will amuse myself by playing Lady Naomi’s games. Search her things, one small bag is what I was told. Leave her isolated. Her only visitors will be her guards and the serving woman. Make sure she is allowed to bathe and make sure she is given some house servant clothing and when you feed her, lightly add some fluoxetine, start lightly, don’t overdo it.”. 


“Welcome, Jim. How was the trip”?

“Not too bad, Greg. I hope your boss gives you these same kind of assignments. I’d hate to be the only one who feels like a messenger boy”.

“No, you’re not the only member of that club. Let me take you to Albert Prime. He’s expecting you”.

Something seemed off. It wasn’t anything he could put a finger on, but… Where was Claudia, Richard’s third. For a pack alliance meeting, the tension found usually bordered on aggravated irritation. This was borderline relaxed. When Greg met him instead of Claudia, his instincts had gone on alert. Not high alert, but raised nevertheless.

“Hey Greg, give me sec. Getting a message from my Prime”.

“Alex, I’m unsure about things here. I’m relying on my instincts, but I’d raise the alert level within our pack. I’m feeling nervous. It’s probably nothing, and if it is, you can beat me up about it later.

Pretty much that is exactly how it played out. Other than a tenser meeting with Richard prime, the afternoon was uneventful. He’d returned to his room to finish up any work he’d brought with him before realizing that dinner time was approaching. With the enhanced olfactory senses of their kind, even subtle spices came across strongly and for the most part identifiable. When Claudia came to escort him everything about her felt constrained, under subtle but significant pressure. She seemed outwardly the same as her morose but congenial self. The walk into the dining room was short and the aromas of many different dishes had him on sensory overload pretty fast. One serving woman carrying a plate/bowl combination caught his awareness. What was that odor? He’d smelt it before. It was going to drive him crazy until he remembered, but first dinner.",1,1756423224.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Because with life’s trajectory right now, I might not even make it to 40, and even if I do, you are probably too busy to read this, or too sick to read this. I hope you’re still doing stand-up comedy. Did we make it big? Probably not, but maybe we made it fun, right? 
To be real, we probably got cancelled pretty quickly. You’re probably still sitting at that damn coffee shop that I’ve been going to from 9-5, even when you're 40, you can’t leave the coffee shop, can you? It’s probably not safe to leave because you don’t know if you’ll find another one that isn’t full, and even if you did find one, would it be nicer? Or would it be just the same, but with a slightly longer commute?
Even if it’s not realistic, I hope you have made it, I you built your own coffee shop and got 100s of returning customers. I hope your coffee shop still stands to this day. I hope you stay off drugs, because those could corrode the very foundation of the building. I hope that your moral compass, which originally guided you to the location you needed to build your coffee shop, I hope it stays strong as a bastion of what you are now and what you once were.
Right now, I am in my sophomore year of high school, and I might have just gotten an internship. I think I just found people who are willing to crowd-fund my own Live Comedy Coffee Shop! Things aren’t always going the greatest, but I’ll pull through… maybe. The reason I’m here right now, August 28th at 9:42 am, writing this to you, is because of a school assignment; otherwise, there would be no note and therefore no reflection of you, no existence of you.

With temptations addressed, let's continue on to assumptions; another fundamentally misunderstood concept. The discrepancy here is relatively straightforward. 

Assumptions - to a certain degree - are just lies. 

Not the brazen, reality-breaking kind like *Watergate* or the ancient Greek diplomat claiming *“there are no soldiers inside this giant, wooden horse,”* with a shit-eating grin painted across their face. Assumptions are quieter falsehoods. Self-directed lies of omission. We assume things to be true when we desperately *want* them to be true. Clarification carries the distinct possibility of proving the opposite of our preferred truth, so why bother? It’s a bad bet. A risk not worth taking. Better to smooth out the harsh edges of reality with a healthy dose of conjecture and just call it day. 

Unconvinced?

Or, even more telling, in disagreement?

Allow me to provide an example.

**Assumption:** My boss hasn’t fired me. *CLM Pharmaceuticals* hasn’t put me down like a horse with a broken leg. Therefore, they didn’t see me dip my hand in the sample jar. They don’t know I left the compound with a piece of the oil. No need to worry.

**Truth:** Jim, the head security officer, said it best:

*“We’re always watching, my dear. Remember that.”*

Need another? Something more recent? Fresher?

**Assumption:** The security camera stationed in the northwest corner of my lab is *just* a camera. Hasn’t done a damn thing to suggest otherwise. Feels like a safe bet, right?

**Truth:** Apparently it’s an intercom, too. The Executive responsible for hiring me called me to his office today through a speaker concealed on the underside of the device.

The unexpected swoon of his familiar voice materializing from the void as I was attempting to work quite literally put the fear of God in me. I leapt backward from my lab table and shrieked like a banshee. Some rogue gesture, whether it was the flailing of my arms or the spasming of my shoulders, collided with the company’s weathered microscope, knocking it off the edge and sending it crashing to the floor. When all was said and done, I couldn’t even recall what he said. Thankfully, that deficit seemed apparent to my voyeur.

*“…need me to repeat the instructions, Helen?”*

I gave the empty air a meek, hesitant nod. He relayed the instructions a second time. Still quivering a little under the influence of epinephrine, I tiptoed over to the steel double doors, and pressed the *up* arrow on the dashboard. The doors opened immediately, almost as if the carriage itself hadn’t moved an inch since I’d entered the lab three hours prior. 

But that couldn't be true, right?

\- - - - - 

**August 28th, 2025 - Morning** 

*CLM* headquarters was certainly a monument to their dominance of the industry: a decadent altar to a once boundless prosperity and an impenetrable, corporate stronghold in the most medieval sense of the word. It just wasn't apparent *when* that dominance occurred, because it clearly wasn't ongoing. 

Based on how empty the place was, that golden age seemed to have long since passed. 

The compound’s architecture was reminiscent of a colossal, upright plunger: a domed foundation that narrowed at the center, with sleek, box-shaped offices that extended upwards floor by floor, thousands of feet into the atmosphere. All the communal spaces were within the dome, things like the cafeteria, security office, greenhouse, gymnasium, bar, nursery, library, chapel, apiary…so on and so on. The functional spaces were above. To continue with the plunger analogy, my lab was about one-fifth of the way up the handle. If it had any windows, I’d probably be able to see a faint silhouette of the city’s skyline from that height.

When I arrived in the morning, I’d pace through the modern, conservatively-furnished lobby, past the aforementioned communal spaces, towards the compound’s singular elevator. Before ascending, however, I’d have to navigate the security queue, an expansive, almost maze-like series of roped-off walkways. There was never any line for the elevator, because I seemed to be the only person who *used* the damn thing. Despite that, protocol demanded I endure a stroll through the entire labyrinth, which was always as vacant as a church parking lot on December 26th, as opposed to skipping the redundancy and saving a few minutes by walking around the side of it all. The *clack* of my heels tapping against the linoleum floor would echo generously through the chamber as I gradually made my way to the end of the queue, twisting and turning until I finally reached the abandoned security checkpoint, which was nothing more than neck-high desk with a dusty sign that read *“Please wait your turn”* and a drab, beige umbrella to shield the non-existent guard from being cooked by beams of sunlight radiating through the windows scattered across the ceiling of the dome.

I say *non-existent* because I never saw anyone posted there, so I believed, until recently, that there was no guard. In retrospect, however, I do recall noticing cheap disposable coffee cups appearing and disappearing from the surface of the desk - there one day, gone the next - so perhaps there *was* someone on duty; we just never crossed paths. Odd, but not impossible. Another assumption proved hollow.

Another lie for the pile, another temptation obliged - so the old saying goes.

Anyway, I’d close my eyes, count to ten, and *""wait my turn""* per protocol. Why do it? Well, as mentioned, they were always watching. Security cameras littered the outside of the elevator shaft like boils on the skin of a peasant about to succumb to the black plague, haphazardly placed and too numerous to count, all angled down to monitor the lobby. Just as with the mandated meditation, I didn’t push back against protocol, even though the protocol felt patently ridiculous in practice.  

On the count of ten, I’d pass the checkpoint, call the elevator, type *32* into the elevator’s digital keypad, tap my badge against the reader, and *presto -* the doors would soon open to my home away from home.

This morning, however, The Executive instructed me via the previously undetected intercom to leave my post, enter the elevator, and type *272.* 

The gears and the pulleys whirred to life before I even placed my badge against the reader. Made me wonder if that step was necessary to begin with. As the machine carried me higher and higher, I tried to remember *why* that was part of my routine. Where did I learn it? Was it part of the protocol? Did I just start doing it of my own accord for some inane reason? My futile attempts at dissecting that mystery were fortunately interrupted by the shrill chiming of a digital bell. The gentle humming of the elevator motor died out. When the doors opened, he was staring right at me from directly across the room, bloodshot gray-blue eyes full and seething with either rage or excitement.

God, and I thought the lobby was *conservatively-furnished*.

Wood-paneled flooring, lacquered with some ancient, jellied varnish.

Blank walls the color of table salt to match the identically blank ceiling.

A small, unadorned desk,

A red-leather, wing-backed chair, decorated with strange, runic symbols embroidered in the leather with silver thread,

and *him*.

*“Helen! What a pleasant surprise…”* he remarked, waving me in from the safety of the elevator carriage.

I crossed the threshold. Instantly, a strong chemical scent wafted into my nostrils: bleach with a tinge of sweetness. As my feet crept forward, my head jerked back from the odor, searching for cleaner air.

*“Surprise, Sir? You called me up here,”* I replied.

He leaned over the desk and gave me a deflated, mirthless chuckle.

*“Oh, I never count my chickens before they hatch. Living without expectations can be ferociously joyful. For me, everything’s a bit of a surprise.”* Recognition flashed across his face. He pulled open one of the drawers and began rummaging through its contents.

*“You really should try it. But enough catching up - surely you know why I summoned you?”*

I *assumed* it was to discuss the specimen theft I’d committed months ago, as detailed previously, and the series of events that followed, which I've only partially documented for you fine people, but you know what they say about assumptions. He slammed the drawer shut and dropped a stack of papers on the desk. As I brainstormed, calculating a strategic answer to his question, the chemical odor sharply worsened. He interpreted the coughing fit that followed to mean: *""no, I don't have the faintest idea why you summoned me - please, do tell”*

*“Well…”* he continued, reaching into his suit jacket and flipping on a pair of reading glasses, *“here’s a hint.”*

After some uncomfortable trial and error, I discovered a pocket of air in the back left corner of the room that was decidedly less harsh. My hacking slowly abated. In a weird moment of symmetry, the Executive began forcefully clearing his throat, as if he was taking over where I left off. He then gathered the stack of papers and began reading.

“***The light was off, but critically; I didn’t watch it turn off. How long had the feed been dead? One tenth of a second or nine? It was impossible to know.”*** His voice was overly animated, with tight punctuation and crisp enunciation, like he was recording an audiobook. He glanced up at me, the bottom half of his face hidden behind the transcript.

My jaw practically hit the floor. I’d been stewing over my lustful ingestion of the oil for *months* now. I held cavalcades of half-answers to what seemed like millions of unasked questions between the folds of my brain - so much so that my head felt heavier on my shoulders - in an attempt to be prepared for this moment. The point at which I’d either have to defend my actions or lie through my teeth.

I feel a bit embarrassed to say I was unprepared for this *particular* angle, but I suppose I have no one to blame but myself. 

*“No? Not ringing a bell? Curious.”* He leafed through the packet and located another excerpt.

*“Ah ! How about: ‘* ***I*** ***always liked the way her blonde curls danced over her shoulders, but I couldn’t stand the sight of the graying strands buried within. The color was a pollutant. It matched the oil to a tee. Made me want to cut the follicles from her skull and swallow them whole.’***”

The Executive smiled at me. It felt like his lips didn’t know how to do anything else.

*“You…read what I posted online?”* I whimpered.

He lobbed the stack of papers over his shoulder.

*“No, of course not! I had someone print out what you wrote, and then I read it. Edited it a little, too.* ‘*I always liked the way her blonde curls danced* ***over*** *her shoulders’ reads a lot snappier than ‘I* ***had*** *always liked the way her blonde curls danced* ***on*** *her shoulders’, but that's neither here nor there.”*

He cupped his hand around his mouth, swollen eyes cartoonishly darting from side to side, lowering his voice to a whisper.

*“My secret to success? I* ***never*** *go online; just isn’t safe anymore. You know that’s where he lives, right? The thing that makes the oil? The man who's here to end it all?”*

My hand began reaching for the elevator’s control panel. He wagged a smooth, alabaster finger in my direction.

*“Helen! Where on earth do you think you’re going?”*

Honestly, a new plan had abruptly crystalized in my mind, and it was exceptionally simple.

Get downstairs.

Find my car.

And drive.

I recognize this next statement may be confusing - mostly because I haven’t gotten to this part in the story yet - but I think it still deserves to be said, even without the appropriate context:

What did I have left to lose by leaving, anyway?

The people I loved were long gone, and that was my fault. 

Might as well just fuck off into obscurity.

*“I mean…I was going to leave. I’m assuming I’m…fired…for what I wrote?”*

A lengthy, pregnant pause followed.

I really had no way of anticipating what came next. 

He tried to appear stoic, but failed, discharging a tiny, capricious snicker.

From there, the dam broke. 

He simply couldn’t hold it in anymore.

The Executive erupted into violent laughter. His cheeks became flushed. Tears streamed down his face. He cackled until he’d divested every single molecule of oxygen he had to his name, and then he just began wheezing, his expression twisted into a surreal caricature of elation throughout the entire episode. I closed my eyes and placed my hands over my ears. I couldn’t absorb the brunt of it. 

There's something desperately wrong with that man. 

Eventually, I creaked a single eyelid open. His joy-flavored seizure seemed to be calming. He flicked a tear from the bridge of his drenched nose and sent a tight fist down onto the desk like a gavel.

*“Oh, wow…good one, Helen. Truly superb. Lord knows I needed that.”*

I think I smiled. I tried to at least.

*“Back to brass tax, though: No! Of course you’re not fired. What a downright silly notion!”*

A rapid exhale whistled through his teeth, and he released a few more sputtering giggles. Aftershocks. Fear aggregated in the pit of my stomach. I thought his fit was going to start over again anew.

*“It’s just…it’s just such a comical scenario. Let me help you understand. Picture this: you wake up at home. You trudge into the kitchen - starving, depressed, and at your wit's end - just hoping for the smallest, most measly of comforts from your steadfast companion: the toaster. To your complete and utter heartbreak, however, it burns your toast. It burns your toast no matter what, because it’s old and newly broken, and…and then the toaster pipes up and asks you if it’s fired! What a lark! The absurdity! The gall of that appliance, thinking so highly of itself! Oh, yes, certainly, you're fired, and you know what, let me get your severance package…should be at the bottom of this trash compactor…of course I don't mind helping you in, no trouble at all...”*

The implications of that statement shuddered down my spine in waves. Can’t imagine my distress was subtle, but he didn’t seem to react to it. Either he didn’t notice or didn’t really care, the latter being the more likely explanation.

*“All jokes aside, Helen - you’re our most promising refiner. We need you; we really do. And this story you've created is so…fantastical! Grandiose and high-falutin and profoundly, profoundly dumb. Idiotic to the point of parody. Talk about not seeing the forest through the trees! You’re firing a bazooka at point-blank range and somehow still missing the point.* *Ugh, and the narrative choices - just outlandish! The 'meditation'? You, a 'world renowned chemist'? It's hysterical! Finally, a well-deserved ounce of levity for us up top. I'm sure you've seen the state of the compound; the disrepair of our company. To say your 'recollection' has been a much-needed light during some very dark times for upper management would be an egregious undersale. You’re of course planning on finishing it soon, correct?”*

I peeled my gaze away from his bloodshot eyes, sheepishly scratching the back of my neck.

*“Uhm…I’m not sure. I’m struggling…I’m struggling to find the ending. The point of all this isn’t…isn’t as evident to me, I guess. Originally, I thought I was doing it for myself. Like a protest, or a confession, or something. Really, though…really, I was doing it for Linda, but, as you’re well aware…she’s gone.”*

Silence dripped painfully into my ears. All the while, I kept my gaze sequestered to the floor, tracing the lines in the wood flooring repeatedly, waiting for him to respond.

He never did.

Not till I looked back up at him.

For the first and only time, his smile was absent.

*“We can bring her back, you know,”* he said, voice coarse, like it was laced with gravel.

*“I mean,* ***we*** *wouldn’t. Not personally, not directly, but we could put the dominos in motion, and then* ***you’d*** *bring her back. Like I said, you’re our best refiner.”*

My heart began to somersault. My mouth felt dry, nearly moisture-less. I begged my fingers to reach for the *down* button, but they refused to listen. I was paralyzed where I stood. 

*“I can’t imagine that’d be pleasant from your side of things. Not one bit. That wouldn’t be the end of it, either. We would dismantle her. You'd* ***watch*** *us dismantle her. Then, you’d bring her back again. Takes talent and genetics to be able to create a Barren, but it takes practice, too. I’d be more than happy to burden you with some very, very specific practice. As much as it took to internalize your position in this hierarchy.”*

*“Am I understood?”* he growled.

I nodded.

Having touched nothing, the elevator chimed, and the doors opened.

*“Perfect! Can’t wait, Helen, truly I can’t wait,”* he purred.

His perfect smile returned. I backpedaled, refusing to take my eyes off of him for even a second. Practically fell as I stumbled into the elevator.

As the doors began to close, he bellowed one last request.

*“Feel free to dramatize this meeting as well! Really excited to see how you spin it, with your tried-and-true piggish emotional density and your apparent grasp on black humor. And, to be clear, this is more than just a creative recommendation, Helen.”*

They shut with a heavy click.

I heard him begin to laugh again as I finally, mercifully, descended.

Took about a minute before I couldn't hear him any longer. 

\- - - - -

With that out of the way, I suppose I can continue where I left off. 

Here's a teaser: 

*Why does the carbon-based, non-cellular grease move with purpose?*

***Because it wants to be whole.***

*What’s the unidentifiable five percent?*

***Well, it’s what’s left over, of course.***

***Left over when he’s done with you.***

Queens from $89.99.,"[**Mattress Firm’s Labor Day event**](https://www.dailybargains.com/m/mattressfirmlaborday) is the kind of sale that actually moves the needle: **up to 70% off**, with **queen mattresses starting at $89.99**, plus **fast, free delivery** on many items. Top brands on the board include **Tempur-Pedic, Purple, Serta, and Beautyrest**—the usual suspects people ask about when they’re tired of waking up grumpy.

# What stands out right now

* **Deep discounts across categories:** traditional innerspring, memory foam, hybrid, and gel foam lines are marked down—good for comparison shopping in one spot.
* **Queen under $100 (select models):** entry-level picks for guest rooms, college apartments, or short-term setups.
* **Adjustable base bundles:** look for hybrid or memory foam mattress + adjustable base packages priced far lower than earlier this year.
* **Free & fast delivery:** many items include free delivery; some areas even see quick turnarounds.
* **Name-brand markdowns:** Tempur-Pedic pressure relief, Purple’s grid feel, Serta iComfort support, Beautyrest hybrid depth—each discounted on certain models.

# Quick guide by sleeper type (keep it simple)

* **Side sleepers:** prioritize **pressure relief**. Shortlist memory foam or hybrid models with a cushy top layer and thicker comfort foam.
* **Back sleepers:** aim for **medium-firm to firm** with strong midsection support. Zoned coils or denser foam cores help keep alignment in check.
* **Stomach sleepers:** look for **firmer** surfaces that won’t let hips sink. A thinner comfort layer over a sturdy core is the play.
* **Hot sleepers:** check hybrids with breathable covers or gel foams; Purple’s grid and many Beautyrest hybrids run cooler than all-foam stacks.

# Angles to help find the right fit

* “**best Labor Day mattress deals 2025 near me**”
* “**cheap queen mattress under $100 with free delivery**”
* “**adjustable base mattress bundle sale**”
* “**Tempur-Pedic markdowns Labor Day**”
* “**Purple mattress sale pressure relief for side sleepers**”
* “**Serta iComfort hybrid back support discount**”
* “**Beautyrest cooling hybrid on sale**”

**Smart ways to** [**shop this event**](https://www.dailybargains.com/m/mattressfirmlaborday)

1. **Filter by feel and height:** firmness labels can be vague. Compare total height, foam densities (when listed), and coil gauge/zoning for a real picture.
2. **Check the trial and warranty:** many mattresses include a multi-month sleep trial and a warranty that covers deeper body impressions. Read the fine print on exchange fees.
3. **Mind the base:** adjustable base bundles can save more than piecing items out later. Confirm compatibility and return policies (bases often have stricter terms).
4. **Heat management:** if sleeping warm is the main complaint, don’t chase extra-soft foam. Hybrid airflow or grid-style comfort layers typically breathe better.
5. **Price history sanity check:** doorbuster prices on clearance models are legit for budget setups, but the sweet spot for long-term comfort tends to be mid-tier hybrids.

# Who benefits most

* **New homeowners and renters** needing multiple beds on a budget.
* **Guest rooms and short-term setups** where a sub-$300 queen fits the mission.
* **Aches-and-pains crowd** looking at Tempur-Pedic or zoned hybrids for alignment and pressure relief.
* **Tech-curious sleepers** who want an **adjustable base** without paying boutique pricing.

# Small print worth reading (yes, it matters)

* **Delivery windows** vary by location and stock.
* **Exchange/return fees** can apply; exchanges may reset the trial.
* **“Up to 70% off”** typically covers previous MSRP or ticketed prices; the biggest cuts often land on last-chance or previous-gen models.
* **Queen at $89.99** refers to specific entry-level SKUs; supplies can be limited.

# FAQs people actually ask

**Are ultra-cheap queens worth it?**  
For a guest room or short-term use, yes. For nightly, long-term sleep, step up to a mid-tier hybrid or denser foam build.

**Memory foam vs hybrid for back support?**  
Hybrids usually win on spine alignment for mixed sleepers thanks to coil pushback and zoned support. Memory foam shines for side sleepers who want deep pressure relief.

**Is an adjustable base really useful?**  
If snoring, reflux, or lower-back pressure is in play, elevation can help. It’s also good for reading/streaming without stacking pillows like a fort.

**What about cooling?**  
Airflow in hybrids and open-grid designs generally beats solid foam stacks. Covers with phase-change material help, but don’t fix an overly plush, heat-trapping build.

**Bottom line:** [Mattress Firm’s Labor Day sale](https://www.dailybargains.com/m/mattressfirmlaborday) is a solid window to grab brand-name beds and adjustable bases at aggressive pricing, with quick delivery in many areas. Shoppers should match firmness and build to how they actually sleep, not just the biggest percentage off. Their back—and their coffee consumption—will appreciate the choice.",1,1756423026.0,dailybargains,0,1.0,False

1n2rdzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/1n2rdzp/opus_coffee_calorie_information/,Opus Coffee Calorie Information,"hi!! i had a chai and a chicken biscuit today at opus, but then realized that there’s no calorie information anywhere.

i googled it and i couldn’t find anything about it. does anyone happen to know where i could get the nutritional information for it?

i did an estimate but i am not too confident in that. plus, id like to try out more stuff and feel good that it’s within my deficit.

thanks it’s advance!",1,1756422902.0,ufl,1,0.67,False

1n2r97m,https://www.reddit.com/r/gout/comments/1n2r97m/first_time_gout/,First time gout,"I’m 43M and on day 3 of my first ever gout flare, I figured I had gout because of symptoms and previous career in pharma sales selling Uloric and Colcrys. Went to urgent care to get colchicine and confirm gout (PCP on vacation), the NP didn’t do any blood work and said since this was my first ever flare it could just be one and done. I used to drink lots of beer/spirits, soda and very little water, and I eat mostly ground turkey and red meat with zero issues…now I’ve cut WAY back on alcohol like maybe once a month having a few drinks, lots of water and a soda a day plus an energy drink in morning(hate coffee), been dealing with a head cold, now I get gout. I have arthritis in my spine, and several bad discs that neurosurgeon is hoping with changing to a moderate lifestyle will help delay surgery a few more years. 

Now I’m starting to wonder…Do I need to get a blood test from primary care doc at my appointment in 2 weeks to discuss requirement of taking allopurinal to help avoid another flare, or see if something else going on that brought this on? Could cutting back on the diet pop to every couple days help? I definitely don’t wish this pain on anyone as I walk a lot in my current traveling sales job and barely being able to walk the last couple of days has been an issue!",2,1756422560.0,gout,17,1.0,False

1n2r8pd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianCoffeeTime/comments/1n2r8pd/over_coffee_think_on_this_matthew_182122_then/,"Over coffee:  Think on this,  Matthew 18:21-22  ""Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.""","How many times have you read this. Never read any further, or, if you did: read on, but never connected it. Over coffee today - Matthew 18:23 is the next verse right after it, but it's said as if it's CONNECTED to this:  So, Jesus isn't done yet. Hasn't finished speaking of it, since Jesus said ""Therefore"" right after it.  

SO - - Flip it.  Rather FIRST: ""cement"" or fuse Matthew 18:21-22 so it never again stands by itself. FUSE it as one thing all of Matthew 18:21 to 27: Over coffee consider NEVER to disconnect them as all one thing. Guaranteed. Man, will you ever see it different.

Matthew 18:23-27 says:

< - {""23 *Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants*.24 *And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents*.25 *But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.*26 *The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.*27 *Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.""*} - >

So, the Kingdom of heaven, how it ""operates"" is over all this earth and heaven as the authority of it, is God is likened unto this ""certain King"" - so, it isn't just one servant - he's going to take into *account all of his servants.*  Think of it this way, too.  You were given ONE Life.  Given life. But, what you did in it, is like every servant did in Romans 3:23  ""*For all have sinned""*  And, if everybody has sinned, then NOBODY can pay the debt; like, you worked your whole life, and what you accomplished in it, can't possibly pay when you owe 10,000 lives worth of debt at the end of it. So, the Master sells off you children, your wife, and possession so a *""payment be made.""*  And God already decreed ""*the soul that sinneth, it shall die""*  (Ezekiel 18:20). What you or I have, and we are all ""servants"" don't have enough to pay it.  Because of the sins we did.

Notice this word, ""worshipped""  in Matthew 18:26.  All ""worship"" means in the dictionary, is to ""speak well of (someone or something) as if ""how 'it' or this someone operates"" or does things just works good. That, because of this 'it"" or (someone), you yourself just operates right.  So, this servant that believes and operates by this with this King, all he has is from him,  and he is the King's servant. He worships the King ..speaks well of him.  Like, everything we got is from God. 

THE KEY THEN IS THIS:  

This ""Seventy times Seven"" - God said this before.  So, this is the 2nd time it's been said.  The first it was said to Daniel in Daniel 9:24-27.  The 2nd time, God has sent his word to Peter to tell him, as God is a King of Kings, to just repeat how this King has determined he would do a work with sin that would ***""finish the transgression; make an end of sin; make reconciliation for iniquity, and bring in everlasting righteousness""*** \[Daniel 9:24\] and how God would do this as King over all the earth, over EVERYBODY as all of us are his servants, is make himself the sacrifice for sin of himself.  That, Daniel 9:25-27 said after it, ""adds up"" to Jesus Christ. This ""seventy 'weeks' or  ""seventy sevens"" - that this is how God determined to do these things with sin as LORD over all things.  

That God looks on this work HE DID in Jesus Christ. Where God took your sins off you. Me. Everybody over the whole earth. God did this work. God Laid your sins on Jesus Christ on the cross; and God was in him on the cross;  crucified, and scripture says ""*To wit, that God was in Jesus Christ, reconciling the world unto himself; not imputing your trespasses unto you"" (*2 Corinthians 5:19)  Take a great, big guess how much your sin cost.  That only HE could pay it.  Made himself the payment.  Satisfied sin is paid for, since he's God and he paid it.

Sound familiar now?  ""*the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.*""  

Did you notice? In the parable? It continues...  to end with Matthew 18:35, so you have to read it all to there to see this ""therefore"" first.  That, this ""work"" God did was done unto me, with my sins and he did the work himself with sin. I didn't do it; that, by that work God chooses not to impute my trespasses unto me. That he ""reckons"" his work he did is GREATER than the sins of the whole world. Asks you to regard what he did.

But..if you read the parable all the way from Matthew 18:23 to 35, this servant didn't regard this work.  So, it would be like me.  Go to Jesus crucified on the cross. ""Over ride"" God's work, as if my work is GREATER than his.  Take your sins off the cross where God put them. That's impossibe. I am unable to do this, because a King did this work. I'm just a servant, but if I act such. To take where he put your sins on the cross. Take them off there, and put them back on you. Then, consider in myself whether I will forgive you your sins.. or not.  I can't. Your sins are GREATER than me. I hold you accountable because you sinned. Even against me.

So, like the servant in the parable, who does not regard the work of compassion this King had on him, I do the same thing.  Did you overlook all the other servants in this parable.  They see it. Are greatly sorrowful, because the SAME compassion this King had on this one servant HE HAD ON ALL OF THEM.  Is ""why"" they go back to this King.   That, because God has done a work with sin, that, satisfies fully God in how he determined sin to be reckoned in Jesus Christ, he raised him from the dead, where he sits at the right hand of God and I am on my face.

That his work is GREATER than your sins, and I see it. That God accomplished this work in ""seventy weeks"" that, 69 of 70 were accomplished for sin and add up to Jesus Christ.  That leaves one week left, of people that REJECT it.

Just like the wrath of this King is poured out on this servant. Thrown into torment til he pays the last penny of a debt that's infinitely beyond them to pay it. Never. For eternity can pay it back. You can't pay it.  So, all I do is look at a work God did with sin.  Same work he did with mine, he did with your's, and I regard it.

If you regard Peter, who is a sinner; thinking ""how many times"" can't even do it one time, let alone 490 times. Therefore...  regard the work of this King over all the earth. What he did with sin, is how he determined it in ""seventy weeks"" told to Daniel. Now repeated to Peter. That it isn't his work.  It's God's own work and for Peter to regard it.  If I regard God's work. His work is GREATER than your sins.  He already did the work. Finished.

Over coffee... regard; that is, pay careful attention to the ""therefore"" and what comes after it as MORE IMPORTANT - what the King did in have compassion and forgave all the debt. Let that work put you on your face.  Because, if you're stuck in regarding Peter and him do it, you regard the wrong work.  You'll end up exactly like the servant in the Parable of Matthew 18:23-35.

I'm about three weeks post breakup with my partner of nearly a year and while I have been able to distract myself somewhat by hanging out with friends and family, and have successfully gone no contact for the last two weeks, I'm still having days where I struggle with the gravity of this choice he made.

We met on Bumble and agreed we were serious and the real deal almost immediately. We moved in together after six months (he asked me), were planning to move to a new city for his job next year. We had even discussed marriage, he had taken me ring shopping multiple times, and we were fully integrated into each other’s friend groups and families.

On the day of the breakup, things seemed normal. We spent time together shopping for apartment items, had lunch, kissed, and said “I love you.” The breakup came at the end of a conversation that he initiated, where we were just kind of going in circles. Rather than cooling off and agreeing to revisit the conversation later, he abruptly said he did not want to be in the relationship and that his mind was made up. There was zero lead up or conversation and it's truly the most blindsided I've ever been.

After he broke up with me, I was completely shocked & heartbroken and stayed with my parents for a few days while beginning the moving process. I reached out via text a few days later to apologize for my part in any misunderstanding that had occurred, and expressed that I understood his experience and perception of the relationship might be different from mine but that I wanted the chance to discuss it so we could talk through it and repair. I asked if we could pause and reconsider, take some space for a week or two, particularly because if I moved forward with moving out that would make everything extremely final.

His responses were unemotional and quite measured, explaining that he had made the decision based on his need for stability and low-stress in life, and that while he valued the relationship and memories, the dynamic wasn’t sustainable for him long-term. He offered to remain friends and when I said no he asked me to take some time to reconsider my decision. He ended up talking me into meeting at a cafe a week after the breakup (I had yet to move out and was still very much hoping we could repair). He acted totally normal, and when it was time to go and I got emotional he essentially used needing to go to the gym as his excuse to leave and left me sobbing.

This is the same person who said things early on to me such as: we would work through anything together, he was deeply committed to us working, how much he values communication, quickly introduced me to all the important people in his life, etc.

After that last time I saw him, he texted me about logistics a few times the following week even after I ignored one message and had my mom text him instead with all relevant issue about the time and day of my move. When I did go back to move, I noticed things I had left behind such as gifts, things that were reminders of the relationship, cards, notes, etc hadn't been touched. Even the flowers he gifted me on August first were sitting on the coffee table. My groceries from the last time we went shopping together were all untouched - mold strawberries in the fridge, my coffee creamer in its usual place.

Is it possible he's just so unaffected he didn't care to touch any of this stuff? Or is he hurting and refusing to show it? I'm just so confused. We had a very loving, close relationship and friendship up until the literal final hour. How can someone destroy someone they claimed to love like this? I'm just so lost, hurt, and confused.

To complicate things further, I was supposed to attend his sisters wedding with him this weekend. I feel so excluded and major FOMO from such an exciting even that I was going to be at with him. I also just don't understand how he won't reflect on his own relationship and the damage he caused back at home while there to celebrate another couples love and lifelong commitment to one another.

I'm not one to ever think of self harm, and I've experienced some terrible breakups in the past. However NOTHING could've prepared me for this level of discard by someone I truly loved and trusted SO much. It almost feels psychosis inducing.",10,1756422342.0,AvoidantBreakUps,5,0.92,False

The tired waitress refills our coffee,And tells us a joke, it’s funny, but none of us laugh.I tell her kindly I’ve had enough,and ask instead if she’ll bring me a coke.

“Of course,” the waitress replies, a little dejected,like she almost wants to cry.My eyes scatter across the room, and fix onan old man playing the lottery at the bar nearby.

His hands shake as each number is scratched away,The waitress approaches and tries,to tell a joke, maybe, she thinks, it will make his day.He says nothing, scratching off the last of the bright colored ink, the old man’s eyes grow wide and he hangs his head.

“You know I'm praying for you, Bub.”She interrupts my thoughts as I look back across the table.I solemnly nod my head and reassure her that I still believeShe goes back to eating and again my eyes wander.

I see a family of four, two boys, a brown haired woman, and a relatively young manThey look happy at a glance but then I noticeThe wife is on her phone and the man begins to clench his fistsThe waitress approaches to give them water and starts to tell a joke.

The man interrupts her, saying he doesn't like his steak.“I apologize, sir, would you like something else to eat?” She kindly repliesThe man says that it’s fine, and he’ll eat it anyway.The kids sit perfectly still, and the woman never looks up from her phone.
The man takes another bite and hangs his head.

“Have you talked to your Mom recently?”Once again, I look back across the tableAn old Elvis song plays throughout the cafe
And I tell her, “No”I look down at my cold eggs, and she goes back to eating, she's almost done.
My eyes once again stray from the table and in the corner of the dinerI notice a lone woman with a black dog.
She's wearing thick glasses, and her dog has a red vest.
She turns her head and looks right at meI nod mp, and she quickly looks away.The waitress brings the woman her dinner and she fumbles around the table, looking for a fork.
The waitress begins to tell a joke, and the dog starts to bark.“That’ll be all, thank you.”The woman curtly repliesShe lays her hands on her dogs fur and still without finding a fork, she hangs her head.

“You will be okay, Bub, I know you will. God loves you.”Longingly, I smile, and tell her, “I know.”She's finally finished eating, and the waitress returns to our table to bring the check.“Is there anything else I can do for you, folks?”
The waitress asks in earnest.I look down at my cold eggs and half drunk coke, and ask her, 
“Actually, yes, what is your name?”The waitress pauses for a moment to think about the question.
Rain drops begins pelting the window beside our tableShe fidgets with her hands, and nervously says,“I am…”My grandmother peers across the table

And with a deep sigh, I hang my head.

1n2qzti,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1n2qzti/im_at_my_wits_end_im_exhausted/,I’m at my wits end…. I’m exhausted…,"It’s been about maybe 5 or 6 months of me starting my new job at McDonalds and god forbid I’m already am putting in applications again, like the stress is too much. I’m constantly drinking coffee all the time, I call off here and there since I’m mentally drained. Like I can’t keep up with the constant stress. I’m already thinking about calling off this weekend since it’s living hell for me. I’m always being yelled at for the stupidest things, Ive been sent home out of spite cuz apparently I smelled when CLEARLY I showered. Im tired of being pushed around EVERY five seconds about McCafe drinks when I have a packed drive thru line, and a full screen of drinks just to run an order out when clearly there is another person who can do it whose not as busy as me. It’s just I can’t, my head is spinning my mental health is declining day by day. I’m sick of being not off on time as well as I’ve been working at least 15-20 minutes past my shift. And I’ve already been in enough arguments with my wife about things. I get it I need to suck it up and push forward but it’s so mentally taxing. As a person with so many metal disabilities it’s difficult for me and I’m starting to think my meds aren’t working and I have to switch them again. I’m hoping I get back into a place where I feel like myself where I’m not doing so many things at once. As soon as I get a guaranteed job, I’m quitting this hell hole. I’m done wasting my mental sanity and risking my wellbeing. I have dogs to take care and a house to take care of too, I can’t waste anymore energy on a hellhole of a job. I should not even consider McDonald’s as a job it’s just stress after stress and it’s killing me. Sorry for the rant but I’m over it ",9,1756421891.0,antiwork,0,0.84,False

(?) Anywho, when I get very upset which doesn't happen too often, things break. The coffee mug on the counter crumbles, windows crack and electrical devices malfunction. Other aqua friends tell me the same stories. Today, I got upset at work and cursed the building. It promptly started on fire an hour later when and electrical socket shorted out, spitting blue flames of molten plastic across the room. It got put out in time to my disappointment. Strange occurrence once again. Yes, it simply could be coincidence. But... what if? Anyone else?",8,1756421864.0,aquarius,3,1.0,False
