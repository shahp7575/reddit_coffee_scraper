He‌y‌ everyone!‌  
About‌ a‌ two‌ weeks‌ ago‌, my‌ buddy- total‌ tech‌ nerd‌ and‌ crypto‌ geek‌ - told‌ me‌ about‌ a‌ method‌ to‌ make‌ money‌ that‌ turned‌ out‌ to‌ be‌ insanely‌ simple‌ and‌ surprisingly‌ profitable‌.‌  
He‌ decided‌ to‌ just‌ share‌ it‌ publicly‌ here‌ on‌ his‌ Reddit‌ profile‌ \[[u/almantas07](https://www.reddit.com/user/almantas07/)\]‌.‌ Honestly‌, if‌ I‌ were‌ him‌, I‌ probably‌ would’ve‌ sold‌ it‌  
But‌ he’s‌ just‌ collecting‌ tips‌ if‌ anyone‌ feels‌ like‌ sending‌ something‌.‌ So‌ I‌ figured‌ I’d‌ help‌ him‌ out‌ a‌ bit‌ and‌ write‌ this‌ post‌.‌  
For‌ the‌ record- I’m‌ currently‌ making‌ around‌ $280/day‌ using‌ this‌ method‌, and‌ after‌ a‌ week‌ I’ve‌ already‌ made‌ \~$1200‌.‌  
Hopefully‌, it’ll‌ help‌ someone‌ else‌ here‌ too- even‌ if‌ it’s‌ just‌ enough‌ for‌ a‌ solid‌ cup‌ of‌ coffee‌  
Good‌ luck‌ to‌ everyone‌, and‌ sorry‌ if‌ I‌ took‌ up‌ your‌ time!",1,1752271839.0,btc,0,1.0,False

1lxjx59,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1lxjx59/caffeine_and_adhd/,Caffeine and ADHD,"When I was young, I was diagnosed With mitochondrial myopathy. When I got older, I was also diagnosed with ADHD. I was off meds for a while and recently got back on a few years ago. I used to down ridiculous amounts of caffeine through coffee and energy drinks to get me through the day. 

Battling both the chronic fatigue from my mitochondrial myopathy disorder and the ADHD has always been challenging.  Since starting my ADHD meds back up, I have had extreme caffeine intolerance but it really only causes two symptoms. A tight chest and labored breathing. Both are incredibly annoying. 

I've seen a primary care, doctor, a gastroenterologist, And a cardiologist.  Everyone says I'm fine. Not just fine, perfect bill of health. Blood pressure is amazing. i've tried the usual supplements like L arginine, and I already take a mitochondrial cocktail, which includes B complex, coenzyme Q10, L-carnetine, and a few others.  Nothing seems to help.  I've heard about vasoconstriction causing problems but I doubt my doctor would prescribe a vasodilator without proof.

Before I completely give up my favorite legal substance and go caffeine free, has anyone else had this issue?  Is there something I forgot to try?  Looking for any help.",1,1752271795.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False
1lxjwwi,https://i.redd.it/u3llabtmjbcf1.jpeg,Haul/reviews ☕️🎃🍂,"Went in store today to get some new fall items for the buy3get3 🍂 I’m obsessed! This is the first time I truly LOVE everything I got & see myself wearing all of these constantly! Here are my reviews as a vanilla/gourmand lover 🍨

Vanilla café - This is officially my new favorite b&bw scent EVER!! It’s everything I wanted it to be. It’s a lovely gourmand caramel/hazelnut latte 🤌🏻 it’s so creamy & delicious. I seen someone say it leans masculine/has a cologne feel to it.. I don’t get that at all! I LOVE coffee scents, this is the best coffee scent they’ve made (yes better than VMM!)

Glazed pumpkin - I loooove this one so much as well! It definitely reminds me a bit of pumpkin swirl cake.. just more expensive smelling?! It’s the perfect fall scent! Such a good caramel pumpkin spice, that also gives a syrup vibe a little! If you love pumpkin/caramel get this!!!

Espresso - This is a straight freshly brewed espresso shot with a hint of chocolate 🤤 this exceeded my expectations! I layered this with vanilla café.. COFFEE HEAVEN!!! If you’re a coffee lover this is so so perfect & a must have in your collection. Not as sweet/gourmand as vanilla café but seriously so perfect. 

Milk - We all know her & love her!! A perfect creamy oatmeal scent 🥛.. layering this with any of the other scents? Delicious! A must have layering option in your collection, I couldn’t recommend enough! 

Side note - I tried vanilla ease & wanted to love it.. but it was so heavy lavender forward to me. People described it as lavender ice cream & I don’t get that vibe at all… nor does it remind me of Burberry goddess. So I passed, but if you love lavender you’ll love it!!

1lxjvy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronicfatigue/comments/1lxjvy4/experimenting_with_energy_drinks/,Experimenting with energy drinks,"I’m 72 year old man. 

I want to share my experience. My motivation is simply, that if I say anything that can help someone, I want to do it before I pass. I know some folks are worse off than me. I’m not a doctor. What I started doing could be dangerous to my health. I’m, like probably a lot of people, are at a point where I just want to have energy to do a few things before I die. So I’m willing to take some risks. If this or something else kills me, I’m ok with that. We are all in a different place. My wife passed last year. I have no connection to my family. They were pretty close to evil. So I’m better off. I have no children and I’m glad I didn’t have children. My late wife felt the same as me. I was very close with my wife. She was my lover, friend and sometimes she had to be my caregiver. She was the most important person I’ve ever known.

I did therapy, after my wife passed, and they told me my coping skill’s regarding her passing is better than any patient they ever had. I think I’m in a good mental state. I’m actually healthier and mentally stronger, which, based on prior trauma and stress, is how I always react. I always get stronger.

20 years ago I decided to take 1 year off to sail in different places around the world and then return to continue my career. 

I started working when I was 6 years old because I grew up poor in a very violent neighborhood. At the time I was going to take time off I was 52. The first week I was going to start my 1 year vacation I fell asleep and for the next 8 months I slept 18-24 hours a day. Watching a 2 hour movie took me about 3 days because I couldn’t focus enough to watch a movie.

After 8 months sleeping almost all the time, a friend of mine recommended an Aging doctor. For a limited time I took HGH, testosterone and other stuff. It costs me about $5,000 per month. It woke me up and I felt pretty good. At that time back in 2005 every doctor told me you’re going to get cancer. I told them I will take the chance. Because I wanted to go back to work. So I decided to take 2005 off and in 2006 I was a part time CFO. I was trying to see if I could function at a higher enough level to continue my career.

When I met my wife in January 2007 she begged me to stop taking all these drugs. She said I want you to be with me for the rest of my life. I told her if I continue taking the drugs I can guarantee you will never have to work and could live anywhere you want to, including Beverly Hills. She told me I don’t care about that. So I stopped. Of course things went back to my low energy state.

I’m a CPA. I was in the corporate world and eventually made it to the top of my profession. CFO.

I was a workaholic. It was ok because I had goals and enjoyed the process. To be a CFO or other senior position in my profession you need to be a high energy intelligent person because the expectations and demands are very high. They don’t pay you the kind of money I can make for being average. Only about 1% of Accounting or other business degrees make it this far in their career. I worked for most of my career, in Finance, my business after high school through college and working starting when I was 6, 80-100 hours per week and several years 60-70 hours per week. Never experienced fatigue. 

For a long time, after CFS, ( I take sleeping pill)  I get up in the morning and drink 3+ glasses of water. I wait 1/2 hour and then drink one 8 ounce sugarless Red Bull and 2 cups of mild coffee. The Red Bull feels slightly euphoric and helps me get off my butt and get going. I guess this is maybe a small taste of what a drug addict must feel. Red Bull still after several years works as a temporary high for me. I never take more than 1 per day.

I made a change about 3 days ago. There’s this energy drink called C4 (I’m sure there are others) I’m not trying to sell this to anyone. I was a gym rat and serous into weight training before CFS. C4 is used by many as a pre workout drink to get you through an intense workout.

This C4 has at least for the last 3 days has changed my life. I feel amazing. The best I’ve felt in 20 years, except limited amount of time I was taking all the drugs. The thing that surprised me is the sustained mental and physical energy. It’s at least a 50% improvement of energy through out the day. I drink it very slowly and eat about 100 calories of carbs to lengthen the benefits through out the day. This improvement is still not close to energy level before CFS.

My side effects I’ve noticed so far is feeling flushed, like rush of heat in head, neck…. This is the niacin. I’ve experienced it when a doctor who wanted me to take niacin supplements. The other is a tingling feeling, like a chill and goosebumps. This is the Beta-alanine. Both are not serious based on my research and doesn’t bother me especially since feeling good is more important for me.

I maybe in a different place than others. I don’t want to feel tired anymore and I don’t have any responsibility to my wife since she is gone.

There are things I want to do and I’m going to do it even if it shortens my life. Btw, nobody knows. One caution is if you are at risk of heart attack, based on the scoring system doctors use to measure your risk, it could cause a heart attack based on what my doctors say about all energy drinks. I am at moderate risk based on the above. But, I’m in great shape and in every other category I’m well above average good health. It’s not a guarantee. But, I’m not worried about guarantees.

I still workout at least 2 times per week at the gym and sometimes my body crashes. I accept the crashes and just do my best to recover and try again. My nutrition is totally dialed in.

I recently tried HGH about 1 year ago. It didn’t help and I stopped. I did the blood test and the stuff was real. 

I’ve tried on and off testosterone therapy. It doesn’t help with my energy. But it’s better than HGH for me.

I don’t know the combination of drugs that doctor put me on or the dosages to feel amazing back in 2005.

Btw, my symptoms match someone with CFS, based on CDC website. I cannot say with certainty that I have CFS. 

Things in my life that maybe unique versus most people is the following: 

(1) I grew up in a rat and mice infested condemned apartment building that was built in the 1880’s. I’ve been scratched so many times by rodents while sleeping. I’ve had bats sleeping in my bedroom because we didn’t have screens on windows. I’ve reached for cereal box sometimes and there is a mouse inside eating the cereal. I’m sure rat or mice dung has probably been in my food.

(2) I’ve worked an insane amount of hours. In Japan they have a strong work culture that the Japanese government has attributed to death from working too much. They call it Karoshi. 300 hours per month is considered extreme risk of death. I worked 350 hours per month for long periods up to 10 years.

So maybe my battery ran out, if that’s possible. 

It’s impossible to pinpoint what causes this excessive lack of energy and decline in intellectual capacity. But I leave this for posterity.

If I can help someone in a some small way I will be very grateful. For others just consider it one persons experience with, I’m sure many folks unique experiences.

Where’s the outrage over that? Where’s the “life begins at ejaculation” bill? Oh wait—they don’t care about “life,” they care about control.

People love to scream “don’t kill a baby!” but never show up to help the actual mother or child after birth. No mental health support, no money, no childcare, nothing. Just judgment and finger-pointing like they’re God.

And the double standard is WILD.
Girls have sex = “slut, you deserve consequences.”
Boys have sex = “boys will be boys, he’s just sowing his oats.”
Like tf?? They act like girls are incubators and boys are gods.


And honestly? If men had to carry pregnancies, abortion clinics would be on every street corner with punch cards like a damn coffee shop.

We matched online and went on a date. He chose the restaurant, everything went pretty well. When he found out I didn’t have a car, he offered to drive me home and even took the longer, more scenic route so we could enjoy the view. He ended up staying over at my place, and the next morning we had coffee together. He texted me when he got home.

About 4–5 days after our first date, I asked when he’d be free to meet again. It took him 1–2 days to reply. He apologized for the delay and said he’d been busy and had a trip coming up, and that he’d reach out once things settled ..so basically not until later in the month for a second date.

I’m someone who prefers meeting up in person rather than texting a lot, and we weren’t texting daily anyway more like every 2–3 days. Last time, I messaged him a few days after our last convo just to let him know I was still around and being patient. He replied pretty quickly.

Now I’m wondering if I should just stop reaching out and wait for him to make a move. But the thing is… that’s not really me.

He seems like a calm, quiet guy who doesn’t say much, but his actions (at least on the date) were kind and thoughtful. I just can’t tell if he’s genuinely busy, not that interested, or maybe testing to see how I react?

Its a Breville bambino and I was trying to dial it in for like 4-5 hours. I have the k6 kingrinder, and a tamp portafilter set from amazon that also came with a screen. 54mm Bottomless Portafilter 3... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3CXTJ5Z?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share I also am using Starbucks beans because I get them for free, so lack of fresh roasted beans is definitely attributing to a rough time.

I believe I have the grind size relatively right for this bean because at dose size 16g, any smaller and the flow is slow and a couple notches bigger and its way too fast. I am definitely getting some channeling because the puck is nasty and loose on top after, and I have a “donut extraction” every time and a lot of spitting and sometimes even spraying.

For puck prep, I don’t have a wdt because in my little experience with non-starbucks machines, it wasn’t necessary. I use the catch cup with my measured amount of beans and circle around the filter basket (always the angle walled non pressured basket from breville) and then lift so theres a little mound on top, then I tamp basically as hard as I can. I have noticed that the tamp is a tad smaller than the basket so theres sometimes a little collection of grounds on the walls. Ive thrown the screen on there and while it stops the nasty top, it still donuts and tastes like channelling.

I had 1 good shot, not too bitter not too acidic, and have failed to replicate that. Most of my shots are very bitter, some completely undrinkable it’s so bitter.

My question is if its in my puck prep and I need to either tamp less/more and maybe wdt, or could it be my equipment, like the tamp not getting the sides well enough?",0,1752271470.0,espresso,2,0.5,False

We scheduled excursions every day- and each one was better than the last. Nighttime forest walk, working farm visit, Mistico hanging bridges, hot spring pools, zip-lining across valleys, Nuyaca Falls, Parque Manuel Antonio and white water rafting. 

The wildlife was amazing- as a family that loves to visit zoos, it was like living in one. The food was wonderful everywhere, especially the fresh fruit and the outstanding coffee. 

But the best part was the people- such a warm and welcoming place, with people ready to share their joy of life with you. 

We will visit again. ",4,1752270648.0,CostaRicaTravel,0,1.0,False

I’ve looked through r/anxiety anytime i feel my heartbeat a little too strongly, i feel pins and butterflies in my stomach, or just overwhelmed and i see that im not alone and many people on here have shared their similar experiences on here. 

I have been experiencing more anxiety as of recently since trying medication and it completely turning on me (20mg of Prozac and 10mg of Strattera). BOY I have never experienced such panic and genuine s*icidal thoughts. I felt like my whole body was unable to function, it was paralyzed with jitters and anxiety. I was on them for a week and couldn’t take it anymore so after talking to my psychiatrist I got off them immediately. 

It’s been 2 months and I have what seems like anxiety that decided to stay put in my body. I have constant stomach butterflies, constant heart pounding though I have a regular heart rate. I’ve gone to the ER and everything seems just fine. I’m setting an appointment to have a physical soon just to get more peace of mind and looking into a therapist now that I have medical insurance. Not looking forward to the price, but living like this is exhausting! I try to keep myself grounded, deep breathing, talking to myself and reassuring myself that if my body was REALLY in danger it would let me know. 

I want to try meditation again but just the thought of meds gives me an overwhelming sense of panic. I cant even take regular medicine without stressing out! I’ve cut out coffee & im working on cutting out weed because as much as I like to think it helps I genuinely believe it’s just distracting me from my stress. 

Has anyone experienced immense fear when taking medication? Have you been able to cope with anxiety without it? Any advice would be greatly appreciated :) ",1,1752270611.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

Amon sits on the edge of the same navy couch, reading peacefully. The cuffs of his khakis ride up where he crosses his ankles to reveal maroon socks patterned with ravens.

An echoing thud suddenly shakes the small room. He frowns, taking off his reading glasses as he turns around. It seems to be coming from the other side of the blank white wall behind him.

Another thud. A muffled voice cries out.

Amon bristles. ""What is this?""

""One sec!"" calls the boy on the other side. ""I just need to-""

A shining metal door suddenly materializes where the strip of wall had been, and out bursts a gangly dark-haired boy with thick, bushy eyebrows. He seems to have slicked up his hair into a stunted mohawk for the occasion. Flying forward, he skitters to a stop by the couch right behind Amon, panting. He looks down at the son of Apollo, looks around the room, and grins like a madman.

""This is awesome!"" He leaps over the couch back, rolling onto the cushion beside his companion. ""Sorry I'm late.""

""No worries,"" Amon says simply. He does not seem amused, but he is entirely not disappointed either. He sets aside his Leo Tolstoy on the coffee table before them. ""You have come from a long way.""

""Yeah, yeah."" Hugo is still catching his breath as he waves away the excuse. ""I did what I could. It's a big day.""

""I know."" Amon turns to look at the space before them. ""What do you want to say?""

""Uhhh."" Hugo scratches the back of his head stupidly. ""Probably should've thought about that on my way here, huh?"" He turns to look ahead too, presumably where the birthday girl could see him straight on.

""Darcel!"" the son of Pandia begins excitedly. ""You are so awesome. What a special day it is. Another year around the moo-""

""The sun,"" Amon corrects.

""The sun,"" Hugo repeats. ""It's so cool to see your creativity across all your characters. You've got so many! And all of them so different. We love them all!"" His grin widens. ""We can even forgive you for what you did with Adrian, because my writer-""

""We also appreciate,"" Amon cuts in again. ""All of the work you have put into this community as a moderator. To drive the plot and to make tough calls to make this a safe environment for all.""

""And Idris Elba!"" Hugo says excitedly. ""I've heard about him.""

Amon stills, closes his eyes, and takes a deep breath. ""Yes. Idris Elba,"" he echoes in his deadpan.

""Happiest of birthdays to you!"" Hugo gives a cheery wave. ""Here's to many more great threads with you."" His face suddenly falls. ""Well, not with me in it, but-""

""You will have a good day,"" says Amon with a curt nod. ""Thank you for your hard work.""

Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but my post keeps getting taken down and Im not sure why and I need help.

I am currently 17m, 18 in a few days. I live with my parents, but this house has not been a home for as long as I can remember. When I was in elementary school, my mom never let me go to sleepovers (my first was when I was 14-15!!!) and friends had to come to my house (even my best childhood friend of 6 years back then). On the rare occasions where she let me go to someone else’s house (I remember these moments vividly), I always dreaded not only coming home, but seeing my mom.  

(I’ll describe my parents in more detail and their actions later)

I am posting about this topic for the first time. I have been discussing this matter with people around me (friends and gf) for a long time and looking for a way out that doesn’t sabotage my life. I am currently living in Quebec, and I attend college. School is a priority for me and has always been (I’ve been an Honors student since elementary). I apologize if this post is all over the place, I am trying to structure everything but there is so much to discuss all at once…

Let’s start with my story. I am an only child and my mother especially is very, very attached to me (helicopter parent times 1000), to the point where it is toxic. She blames certain events in my life for being so scared of losing me, but these things happened a long time ago and are not really relevant anymore as I am nearly an adult now. Oddly, she has been getting progressively more clingy as my 18th birthday approaches. My mother studied child psychology and is always proud to admit it (I even have her books in my closet), and bearing this in mind, I started noticing things I did not beforehand, right about when I hit 13 years old. In elementary, because she essentially never let me leave the house, I did not know how other households were. My mom would always tell me how “amazing this house is and how lucky I was to have them as parents yadayadayada”, but cracks were starting to show. Her behavior was always very secretive. “Do as I say and don’t question me, I’m the parent, you’re the child, I know better” (she still says these things regularly). She always blatantly manipulated me and other kids to do what she wanted, like getting my friends to do chores when they come over, etc. She always hides her true intentions behind the facades of “interest”, “family”, “trust” and things like that. She regularly uses guilt and gaslighting to try to get me to do things or to get herself out of situations and avoid accountability for her actions. One of the biggest examples of this is her telling me how “ungrateful you are, because when your dad got sick, I had to take care of everybody and you and the house and I lost everything and…”. She does this for everything she “does for me”. For example, if I want to see my best friend who I haven’t seen in nearly a year (he lives close by, but far enough that I need a car ride), I need to spend a whole day helping her with chores afterwards, I need to follow her rules, text her about every 4h, I need to do absolutely nothing “wrong” in the lead-up or after, etc. Even if all she has to do is say “yes, you can go”, this happens every single time. She usually imposes absurd time limits, but this has kind of gotten better over time (kinda). So, I never actually see people except for my neighbour because, well, she can’t really physically prevent me from seeing him (21m, known since birth). Then, on the way home, she will drill me with very obviously pointy questions, “just out of interest” and get mad when I answer vaguely. Every time she sees me on my phone, she not only asks what I’m doing, but she goes straight to “who are you texting”. If I answer, she’ll ask on what app I’m texting them, what is being said, etc. Again, all out of “interest”. She also has a no closed room door policy for, you guessed it, MY ROOM ONLY! She will barge in any time she wants, multiple times a day, just to see who I am on call with and “say hi”. Again, her intentions are obvious, but she goes through all the trouble of hiding behind the facade of a “caring mom just trying to bond with her son”, and that is the story she tells everyone. For obvious reasons, we have not been close in years and I don’t tell her anything of significance, because she has proven she will not only use it as a weapon against me, but she will not help. My whole life she has said “you can talk to me, even if you might get in trouble”, then immediately made me regret trying to trust her. This might sound pretentious, but I’d like to add that many people (employers, family, friends and their parents, etc.) always tell me I am a good kid and I believe it. I work hard, I focus on school, I don’t do drugs or party, I’m as neutral as it gets. So much so that I only ever get in trouble for small things that my parents gripe about, little insignificances (they’re never happy, I “never change”, when I tell them that they say “oh no we are we see all that you do” then keep complaining and telling me “you’re selfish, you don’t do enough and help enough, you don’t spend enough time with your family, you game too much (I really don’t, I’ve had time limits my whole life), etc.”). My dad in all of this only buys peace. Since grounding me is the easiest thing to do to shut my mom up, that’s what he does. Let me give yet another example. A few days ago, we went camping with my girlfriend of nearly a year (for the first time). The whole day, my mom was acting up about sleeping arrangements and my dad confronted her and said “they can sleep together, they’re old enough I don’t mind”. So my mom got my girlfriend and berated her for at least 2h (as they were in the car and at the store) about not becoming pregnant and the importance of family time (trying to make my girlfriend who I hadn’t really seen in a few weeks coax me into spending all my time with them and not alone with her for a bit) and just generally being a bully. She got mad at me (obviously only when we were alone) for making my dad mad at her, she tried to get my girlfriend and I to separately agree to not sleeping in the same bed even though my dad said it was okay and to not argue with her, etc. Essentially the whole day was dealing with her childish tantrums and it felt like I was the parent and she was the child, which happens a lot. Surprise surprise, my dad bails on me that night because he is too tired and he says to “listen to your mom for tonight”. When it comes time to sleep in our camper, I decide enough is enough and I get in bed with my girlfriend instead of sleeping on the floor. Sure enough, my mom comes out of their “room” 2-3 times that night as I feign sleep and she even shines a light on me at midnight. The next morning, we wake up late (they let us sleep in for once) and immediately my dad says “pack up, we’re going home [the day after we arrived]. Your mom is pissed. I am disappointed in you, blablabla”. Shitty morning. We get home and drive my girlfriend back home. On the ride back I tell my dad about everything my mom does and he doesn’t even bat an eye. Later, he tells me I have to apologize to my mom and “solve this”. At this point, they have been acting like I punched my mom in the face or something, but all I did was listen to my dad and not her. They act as if I “broke her trust” (clearly there was none in the first place) and it’s all my fault and I’m in the wrong. Again, I just went to bed with my girlfriend and it wasn’t the first time and my dad said it was fine.

My girlfriend goes through this crap every time my mom goes to get her. I will add that my mom usually finds a way to force me to stay home so she can go alone, then she picks her up earlier than she tells me and takes her to have a “girls only coffee”. As it turns out, that is all so my mom can use my girlfriend to vent all her life problems and talk behind the backs of everyone in her life, especially me (you start noticing the patterns and two-facedness…). Obviously, my girlfriend tells me. It doesn’t prevent my mom from doing it though… She does it to me and to everyone she talks to. My mom actively tries to harm our relationship it seems. She has been doing this since I was with my ex at 14. She forces my gf to help her do chores on the rare occasions she comes over to my place to hang out, leaving us only 2-4h on average of time to actually do something together. Shocker, my gf doesn’t like coming here anymore and my mom won’t let me go to her house more often than she comes over. My mom also forces me to go do other things for her so she can be alone with my girlfriend and so she can talk with her “privately”. She even acts jealous when I am with my girlfriend, saying things like “you don’t want to do this with me but it’s fun with her?” and other crappy comments like that, which obviously make me want to avoid spending time with her. My mom also shows up very early the day after I sleep at her house (which was a fight in itself and is every single time), like 9:30, and the ride home is like an interrogation. So much so that my friends have taken to calling her “Gestapo”. She is always trying to sniff out lies and dig into my personal life. Here’s an example. I am pretty tech savvy, so I found ways around this, but for the longest time my mother had all my passwords (she forced me to give them), she limited screen time excessively (think 15 minutes of gaming or just even total screen time a day in grade 6 and by grade 10 1h was a lot), she had access to all my devices and even for a time was the only one to know the password to MY COMPUTER!!! For what reason? No clue, I never actually did anything to warrant these measures. I’ll add that my whole life, she’s been trying to convince me that she “is not strict at all and that you can go in other households to see and you’re lucky to have us as parents (or usually, “lucky that I am your mom”)”. This applied to my phones too. I got an ipod that I bought myself when I was 12ish, and it stayed in their room and they had the pin and app store locked. Then I got old devices and… same story! (until I started outsmarting them with old samsungs). My mom would randomly grab the phone from my hands and scroll through my photos and prevent me from taking the phone until she was done. She earned the name Gestapo because of her actions: she is always inquisitive, in everyone’s business and she is scheming like an interrogator; you never know what will happen. Once again, I did nothing to warrant these searches. The biggest offense was sneaking my ipod into bed and texting at night once. To this day, I cannot have my phone plugged in near my bed or any device for that matter. Don’t even get me started on computers in the room, that was a fight and a half too and I finally won.

Everything I mention happens on a daily basis, so life is fucking miserable. I am tired of this stupid psychological war. It drains me and I’ve wanted out for so long I even considered suicide at one point (I’m okay now). I have been looking for a way out for years but I have nowhere to go, my mother still has my banking cards and some of my money is in a savings account in her name that she “keeps for me but won’t let me see” (it’s a legit practice, but the circumstances don’t help her credibility). For reference, I have never been an impulsive buyer and I am very good with money, so there is NO NEED for her to keep my cards. I spend about 60$ a month: Spotify (I pay for the whole family) and my phone data, with the occasional treat. When I buy stuff, I sell stuff to pay for it (or my mom makes me). She has all of my money except for what I didn’t deposit and keep as a security fund (about 300$). I need out. Talking with them has gotten me nothing and made everything worse, I have nowhere to go and I have to be able to get to school. Last thing I need is to fuck up my life some more. What should I do?

Let me know if I can clarify anything, there’s so much to say I don’t know where to start. I barely scratched the surface here :(.

Cheers!

1lxj9wr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1lxj9wr/wrong_expectations/,Wrong expectations?,"Hey all,

I’m wondering if my expectations for the AeroPress are off.

My wife got me one to save money making coffee at work (no Nespresso there). I usually drink Nespresso with flavored creamer or buy lattes.

I bought a grinder and tried decent beans (Black & White “The Classic”) but my AeroPress coffee tastes sour or thin, lacking the body and strength I like.

Is it realistic to expect AeroPress to make something similar to Nespresso or lattes? Or am I using it wrong / expecting too much?


My setup:

•	Aeropress (inverted)

•	Metal filter •	Kettle water ~195°F

•	Timemore C3 grinder (usually 9 clicks)

My process:

•	Bloom ~30 sec (quarter full)

•	Fill rest with water

•	Cap for ~2 minutes

•	Slow plunge

What I’ve tried:

•	Grind: fine to medium

•	Brew time: 2–5 min

•	Water temp: ~195°F and lower

•	More beans, I only have the AeroPress scoop to use as a measuring device. No scale.

Any tips or insight would be appreciated!",1,1752270131.0,AeroPress,18,1.0,False

Amon, resting his hands on the knees of his khakis, shoots the freckled boy an angry glare from the other end of the couch.

""You are being embarrassing.""

Booker doesn't look up from his work. ""Dunno what you're talking about, brother. What are we doing here again?""

""Birthday. We are wishing Mal a happy birthday.""

The son of Zeus pockets the knife with a lazy ease, sitting up to meet Amon's intense dark gaze. ""Alright then. What's the plan? Where is she, anyway?""

""Right there."" Amon points at the space in front of where the boys sit. ""She has been watching already. You look like a fool.""

""Oh."" Booker immediately straightens, sliding his feet off of the coffee table. He gives a warm smile at the invisible girl up ahead, sheepish and charming to make up for his behavior. ""Sorry 'bout that, princess. Wasn't in on what this was all about.""

""Now that's some nonsense. Everybody likes me.""

Amon bristles. ""We are speaking of Mal here. It is her day.""

""In that case, we're all Gucci."" Booker leans back in the couch, spreading out his arms across the cushions. ""I don't need to hang out with Harper to know that Mal's the real deal. Writes some good stuff. I think.""

""You do not think.""

Amon exhales slowly, and turns away from Booker to look straight ahead. ""Ignore the knucklehead,"" he says flatly. ""We are here to tell you that you are a great writer.

Habitual book-sniffer, poster child for introversion. Single, for those that care. My pic: [https://imgur.com/a/sXt2vyY](https://imgur.com/a/sXt2vyY)

I'm craving connection, fellow redditors. I'm happy with one-off conversations or potentially building new friendships; let's see where we end up!

Lists are awesome, so here's one populated with random factoids about me! YAS!

* I love to read! I'm currently reading *The 48 Laws of Power*, and *Atomic Habits*. I have books all over the place and I'll read almost anything. My to-read pile is over 200 books and counting, because I'll probably add more tomorrow. I usually do. It's almost as tall as me (I'm 6'2"") and I affectionately call it Book Mountain^(tm). Yes, it's a problem. No, I'm not stopping. Books are life. And coffee.
* I love writing code and collect old programming books, particularly ones related to games and graphics. I feel like I'm in my element when I'm creating something and watching it evolve over time, especially if it's for a retro system. There are moments when I'll stop and think just how happy I am, while feeling a sense of euphoria and belonging, which I don't really get doing anything else. I haven't done it for a while and I really miss it. I feel out of touch with an important part of me.
* I experience social anxiety and sometimes depression. I'm a big fan of exposures and not hiding from how I feel, despite the intense need to sometimes; we don't grow if we don't face ourselves. I think I'm my biggest obstacle in life purely because of some patterns I'm stuck in, but I also think I'm my best asset, purely because I recognize I can change things if I really want to. I try to be responsible for how I feel.
* Allergic to small talk. It's a special kind of hell. Phone calls, too. Shoot me now. I'm happy to send voice messages on occasion though. It's actually preferred when I'm in the middle of things.
* I love art, Zdzislaw Beksinski and H.R. Giger are favourites. Street and ANSI art, too. Life is art.
* Big fan of 90s and 80s games. C64 anyone? Also fond of cozy games like Stardew Valley and Palia. I'm currently playing No Man's Sky and Coromon.
* I'm not into manga, anime, super hero movies, comics, Disney or JavaScript. It's cool if you are though, you do you. Recommend me a manga and I'll try it when I'm feeling adventurous. Maybe :P. I did go through a kdrama period though, so there's that. The Penthouse was *ridonkulous* but so good.
* I hike and I'm one of those people that takes random photos during my day; flowers, fungi, books etc. If we hit it off, be prepared for photos :D I like sharing, it's fun. You're more than welcome to share too, though it's not expected.
* I'm a quiet idealist (and dreamer) who's usually lost in the idea of what could be, instead of being down in reality because reality sucks. I want to aim high and strive for what could be. I usually fail or when I get there it doesn't quite look how I envisioned it to be, but I have no regrets.
* I write on occasion (doesn't everyone?). Usually bad poetry or flash fiction.
* Lover of clouds & sunsets, the shadows cast by leaves during the evening sun, people watching, petrichor, birds, and the euphoria of doing something I love. Summer storms are pretty great too.

Tell me about you and what you're passionate about. I'm one of those people who loves hearing about what people are into. If I ask too many questions (it happens), I don't mean to interrogate. I'm just interested. :P

I'm not looking for anything romantic. If you're interested, flick me a chat request if possible. I'm also willing to move off reddit if we hit it off, if you so wish.",2,1752270076.0,NZFriends,0,1.0,False

if youre dating would you paint his nails how you did mine at all day coffee co when youre only friends and got out of a rel a month ago? or make special ammends so he comes to your birthday party when youre only friends or when he tells you hes broke take him out for food and shopping or wakeup at 6am to talk because he has his school early and youre there for you summer vacation or mail him for a good few years? or call him first when youre crying bec of a family emergency? or hug his arm in front of your mom when youre only friends or kiss him in front of the cctv or would he know by the second u say hi if youre sad or not you said it yourself your friends or your mon coudnt.

i get it i was a loser bf ik i really was im not asking for sympathy but im genuinely sorry i shouldve cherished you more how i actually wanted to showed u how much u meant to me. i was all talks and dreams. i didnt do a single thing thay i wouldve done and dreamed about if i had you. 

i could list a million things youve done for me dude from before we dated i could list a few that i did. it was all good bw us since the very start since first grade. i get it things ended bw us. but why do i get this treatment from you after months of zero contact when i did held my own. i didnt text you once or tried to contact. i didnt relapse or acted depressed i actually got better 

so after all of this why do you act like i was super f mean or bad to you. you tell people i am a creep when all i did was send 3 texts to my bestfriend of 14 years and now ex gf after months of no contact only asking for closure and a real talk.
why did i ever do to you that makes you scared of me? i never would’ve touched you without your permission. 

i never once said i wanted another chance or a go at it but yes i do miss you i do miss my friend. you were the one thing that got me through my 9-10th grade and then college. a conversation woudntve hurt. 

since youve left ive had the worst year of my life not bec u left but since youve. family stuff over and over. why does me texting u thrice after 8 months make me a creep?

why do you hate me now? dont talk to me. but just once let me know this. ik i was a bad bf i didnt live upto none of our expectations i could give you my reasons and excuses for not but you wont be willing to hear. 

the way i acted after august it was bec of what u did. i was trying to be better but everytime i would get home it would stress tf out of me that what if you did the same again tomorrow i had no clue the last time u did i never expected a single bit. i coudnt grow past it in a single month i was getting over it slowly but then u left for uk. and those couple days of absence did stress me out and bring me to 0. thays why i talked too much tried soo desperately to fix fights or did everything too much. bec i didnt want to be abandoned again. did it never occur to you that you did all that to me yet i tried to be better and u say im the bad guy and youre scared of me when youre in our city.

1lxj850,https://i.redd.it/xs2az85debcf1.jpeg,✅ Passed AWS SAA-C03 – Thought I Failed Miserably 😅 (Got 810),"Hey everyone,

Just wanted to share my AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03) experience. I seriously thought I failed — was already coping in advance 😭 — but got the 810 email on Credly and I'm finally breathing again.

I’m writing this post for:
• Anyone in that post-exam limbo.
• Anyone feeling overwhelmed during prep.
• Anyone scrolling Reddit like I was, praying they passed.



🎯 My Preparation Journey
📚 What I Used:
• Stephane Maarek’s SAA-C03 course on Udemy.
• Tutorials Dojo (TD) practice exams — bought from Udemy too.

🧠 How I Studied:
• Completed all 6 practice exams from Tutorials Dojo.
• On my first attempt, I scored:
 ➡️ Between 60–72% average
 ➡️ Reviewed every question I got wrong and made notes.
• Gave all exams again after review, and my scores went up to:
 ➡️ 80–90%
• Final revision: Re-reviewed questions I got wrong again and deep-dived using ChatGPT (the TD explanations weren’t enough for me).


⚠️ A Twist the Night Before...

I was just randomly scrolling YouTube when I discovered that Stephane Maarek has a free sample test inside his course lectures — I hadn’t touched it before!

• Took the sample test — scored 67%, and it completely threw me off.
• The question style felt different from TD, which made me super nervous.
• Still, I reviewed all 20 questions I got wrong and went ahead with the exam.


🧪 The Actual Exam Experience

Let me be real — it was mentally brutal.
• I had the ESL 30-minute extension, and still finished with only 7 seconds left.
• Couldn’t review the 4 questions I flagged.
• The questions were long, and I kept forgetting the first part by the time I reached the end.
• I kept scribbling on the notepad to remember services and their use cases.
• The AC in the test center was noisy, and I couldn’t focus for the first 10–15 mins (if you're sensitive to this, ask them to fix it before starting).
• By question 50, my brain was cooked. Like fried. I was barely functioning.


🧠 Post-Exam Mental Breakdown (Sort of)

• Walked out of the test center with shaking hands.
• I was speechless the whole ride home.
• Fully convinced I failed — I kept telling myself “Maybe the 15 ungraded questions were the ones I got wrong...”
• Couldn’t sleep for 5 more hours (this was after being awake for 18 hours).
• Finally at 2 AM, I got my Credly badge email and went straight to binge-eat my favorite food. That dopamine hit was unmatched.


📌 Final Score: 810 / 1000
Not perfect — but more than enough to pass, and honestly, I’m proud of myself for pushing through it.


💡 Tips for Anyone Preparing for SAA-C03

• Use ChatGPT (or similar tools) 
The reviews on TD are useful, but not deep enough. Use AI or mentors to ask follow-up questions and really understand concepts.

• Do NOT skip Stephane’s free sample test
 It's inside the lecture list on Udemy. Different question style gives you broader perspective than just doing TD.

• Don’t panic if your first TD test scores are low (60–70%) Review them properly. What matters is how much you improve the second time.

• Sleep well + drink coffee before the real exam
 The 2h 40m runtime (with ESL) will drain you — don’t underestimate mental fatigue.

• Practice time management
 Try to finish TD practice sets within 2h (if ESL) or 1h 40m (no ESL). Review later — but practice for speed.

• Don’t believe Reddit blindly
 I saw tons of posts saying ""TD is harder than the real exam.""
 → That was NOT the case for me.
 Real exam felt longer, heavier, and way more exhausting.
• Don't stress after the exam
 I was sure I failed. But I passed. A lot of you are overthinking — trust your prep.


💬 Why I Wrote This

I made this post for two kinds of people:

• Those waiting for results — I know the anxiety is real. Hang in there. It might just be better than you think.

• Those preparing — I hope my messy journey helps you feel less alone, and gives you a more realistic expectation of what the exam feels like.
Good luck to everyone going for it — you got this.

And if you're already cooked like I was — go eat something awesome and rest. You earned it.

Four Years Ago – Junior Year, Fall Semester

The party had long since tipped from fun to chaos. Plastic cups littered the porch, the bass from someone’s half-dead Bluetooth speaker vibrated the rickety banister, and someone was screaming karaoke into a mop handle like their life depended on it. Inside the old rented house—Asher and Nico’s off-campus pride and joy—the smell of cheap beer and chili cheese nachos clung to the air like defeat.

Ellis Hart was tucked into her usual spot on the sagging leather couch, legs folded beneath her, oversized flannel sliding off one shoulder. She nursed a watered-down cocktail and tried not to stare at the man she’d been in love with since sophomore year.

Asher Holt.

He was currently standing in the kitchen with a red Solo cup balanced on his head while Jonah tried to flick peanut M&M’s into it like a frat boy version of Olympic archery.

“He moves again and I swear to God—” Jonah launched another one, missing by a mile and hitting the microwave.

Asher grinned that crooked grin that always melted Ellis like wax. “You’re just mad I haven’t blinked. That’s discipline, baby.”

“Or brain damage,” Beckett muttered from the other side of the couch, pushing up his glasses. “Either way, it's very on-brand.”

Ellis snorted, burying the sound in her cup.

It wasn’t fair. How easily Asher could light up a room. How his laugh rolled through crowds and pulled people in. How he was both beautiful and reckless, the kind of man who left burn marks on people without ever meaning to. She’d memorized him long ago—the constellation of freckles on his left shoulder, the scar on his brow from when they snuck into a construction site freshman year, the way he absentmindedly tugged the sleeves of his hoodie over his hands when he was nervous.

She also knew he’d never look at her the way she looked at him.

Not when he had an entire world of options.

And especially not when half of them were currently gyrating to Lizzo in the living room, including the girl he’d kissed an hour ago.

“Stop drinking that shit,” Beck said beside her, flicking the straw in her cup. “You’ll regret it in about four hours.”

“I regret it already,” she murmured, but passed him the cup anyway. “What are you drinking?”

“Smart water and a low tolerance for human stupidity.”

Ellis smiled. Beck had always been her quiet backup. The first one to notice when she got too quiet or disappeared from a conversation entirely. The kind of guy who saw everything and said very little.

But tonight… he was watching her more closely than usual.

“I know,” he said finally, soft enough that only she could hear it.

Her spine went rigid. “Know what?”

Beck’s eyes flicked toward the kitchen. Asher was now laughing, caught in a bear hug from Nico, both of them swaying to the beat of a song someone had queued up just to piss them off.

“You’re not as subtle as you think, Ellis.”

She swallowed. Hard. “Don’t.”

“I’m not judging—”

“Beck,” she whispered, turning to face him fully. “Please. Don’t say it. Don’t ruin this.”

He didn’t move. Just studied her like he wanted to fix something but knew she wouldn’t let him.

“He’s my best friend,” she said, voice cracking even though she tried to smile. “I’m not—I’m not doing this to myself, okay? I know what this is.”

Beck ran a hand through his hair and sighed. “Does he?”

She didn’t answer.

Because the truth was no.

No, Asher didn’t know. Because if he ever did, everything would change. Their friendship. The way he leaned his head on her shoulder when he was drunk. The way he texted her at 2AM to come eat burgers and talk about architecture drafts. The way he once said, “You’re my person, Hart,” like it was the most obvious thing in the world.

He didn't see it. Didn’t want to. And she wasn’t brave enough to shatter the illusion.

Not yet.

“Promise me you won’t say anything,” she said. “To him. Or to anyone.”

Beck hesitated.

“Please.”

He exhaled. “Okay. But if he ever hurts you—”

“He won’t,” she said quickly. “He can’t hurt me. I’ve already set the bar at zero.”

Beck’s expression turned pained, but he nodded.

From the kitchen, Asher called her name like a shot of sunshine. “Hart! Get over here—Beck sucks at flip cup and I need a partner with actual skills.”

Ellis stood, smoothing her flannel and wiping emotion from her face like it was just another night.

“You coming?” she asked Beck, offering him a lifeline back into the chaos.

He didn’t move. Just looked at her with quiet sympathy.

“You’ve got it bad,” he said under his breath.

And she did. God, she did.

🜲

The next morning was the kind of ugly that only college hangovers could birth. Ellis found herself in Asher’s kitchen wearing one of his shirts and brewing coffee like she lived there—which, in a way, she almost did.

He strolled in minutes later, hair tousled, bare feet on the hardwood.

“You crashed on the couch again?” he asked, already rummaging for cereal.

“Where else would I go? Rowan had her guy over, and I was too lazy to Uber.”

“You know you can always stay here,” he said easily.

She looked at him over her mug, his back turned, shirt hanging low on his hips.

Always stay.

Like she was a fixture. A constant.

Never the exception.

“You really don’t get it, do you?” she whispered under her breath.

He turned. “What?”

“Nothing,” she said brightly. “Want eggs?”

He grinned. “You’re a goddess.”

No. Just a girl. Just your best friend. Just the idiot who’s been in love with you since the first time you let me borrow your hoodie and told me I looked better in it than your girlfriend.

She made him eggs anyway.

🜲

Present Day – Four Years Later

The text came at 2:03 in the morning.From Asher.

\-Got big news. Call you when you're awake. You’re gonna lose it.

Ellis rubbed her eyes, blinking against the glow of her phone screen, heart already skittering with a weird kind of dread. Asher only texted her like this when he was excited. And Asher excited usually meant Ellis devastated.

She tossed the phone onto the blanket, rolled onto her back, and stared at the ceiling.

Whatever it was—whatever Asher Holt was about to tell her tomorrow—she had a feeling it was going to split her in half.

Chapter 2

Present Day – The Morning After the Text

Ellis had lived through some truly bad mornings in her life.

There was the time she accidentally emailed a topless sketch to a children’s book publisher. The week her favorite ramen place closed. The Thanksgiving she discovered her mom had been secretly dating her ex-boyfriend’s father.

But this morning? This one clawed its way straight to the top.

It wasn’t just the low ache behind her eyes or the dried paint under her fingernails or the familiar smell of cat litter wafting from her roommate’s hallway diffuser.

It was the silence.

Because the text Asher sent at 2:03 AM had yet to be followed by a call.

And the longer he waited, the worse her stomach churned.

Ellis stood barefoot in her kitchen, aggressively stabbing at a bruised avocado while the kettle whistled like it had something personal against her.

Rowan walked in, bleary-eyed, wrapped in a black silk robe with “Witch, Please” embroidered across the back.

“Why are you maiming produce like it insulted your uterus?” she asked around a yawn.

Ellis didn’t look up. “Asher texted me last night.”

Rowan stilled. “What’d he say?”

“Big news. Call you when you’re awake. You’re gonna lose it.”

“Ominous,” Rowan muttered, pouring herself coffee. “Think he finally figured out he’s in love with you and wrote a sonnet?”

Ellis threw her a look.

“Kidding,” Rowan said, but her expression softened. “Maybe it’s a job thing. He’s been trying to get that museum project, right?”

“Maybe,” Ellis lied, though her chest was already heavy with something far more specific. Something sharp.

She knew Asher.

He never waited this long to share good news.

If it were a job, he’d have sent a voice memo. If it were something stupid like getting free pizza for a year, he’d have FaceTimed her from the restaurant. But this? This delay?

It was personal.

Her phone vibrated on the counter like a warning shot.

Asher Holt: You up?

Ellis stared at it like it might explode.

Rowan raised an eyebrow. “You’re not gonna answer?”

“I am,” she said. Then didn’t move.

After a long pause, she exhaled, picked it up, and texted back: Call me.

The screen lit up less than five seconds later.

She answered on the second ring, heart galloping.

“Morning, Hart,” he said, and just like that, her knees weakened.

Damn his voice.

Damn his warmth, his ease, his perfect ability to act like nothing ever hurt her.

“Morning,” she said, forcing her tone light. “What’s the big life-altering news?”

A pause.

Then:

“I’m getting married.”

Ellis went still.

Time warped—like she was falling, but her body forgot how to hit the floor.

Married.

The word looped, hot and jagged.

“Wow,” she managed. “That’s… fast.”

“It’s not that fast,” he said, misreading her tone. “It’s been eight months.”

Eight months.

She hadn’t even known he was seriously seeing anyone. He’d mentioned someone named Madeline once or twice, sure. But with Asher, that didn’t mean anything. He had a new “I like her” every other month.

“Wow,” she said again, because her brain couldn’t do anything else. “So… you proposed?”

“Last night.”

“And she said yes.”

He laughed. “Obviously.”

Right. Of course.

Because no one said no to Asher Holt.

Ellis felt the smile crack on her face, pieces of it falling silently into her coffee.

“I’m happy for you,” she said, though the lie felt acidic.

“Thanks,” he said warmly. “You’re the first person I called.”

She blinked, heart twisting in her chest.

“Really?”

“Of course. I mean—Jonah and Beck were there when I did it. But you’re—you’re my person, Hart. Always have been.”

Her throat closed.

Always have been.

But not in the way that mattered.

“Anyway,” he continued, oblivious, “that’s not all. I wanted to ask you something.”

Ellis braced herself, already dizzy.

“Will you be my best man?”

Silence stretched.

A beat. Then another.

And then a laugh—raw, sharp, too loud.

“You want me… to be your best man?”

“Yeah,” he said. “Why is that funny?”

Because it’s not funny, she thought. It’s cruel.

Because I’ve been in love with you for years and now I get to help you marry someone else. Dress up, make toasts, plan your bachelor party like I’m not bleeding inside.

But she couldn’t say that.

So she cleared her throat. “Sorry. It just… caught me off guard.”

“I get it,” he said. “But honestly, I couldn’t imagine doing it without you. You know me better than anyone. You’re—”

“—your person,” she finished quietly.

He laughed. “Exactly.”

Ellis smiled through it. “Of course I’ll do it.”

Rowan, standing across the kitchen, mouthed what the fuck at her.

Ellis gave her a thumbs-up and promptly ended the call.

Then she sat down on the cold tile floor and didn’t move.

🜲

By the end of the week, the group had officially reconvened at a rooftop bar to celebrate the engagement.

Asher was glowing. Madeline was poised. And Ellis was dying in a strapless dress she never would’ve picked for herself.

Jonah slapped her on the back. “You good?”

“Peachy.”

“You look like someone just told you Gilmore Girls was getting a reboot starring Jake Paul.”

Ellis rolled her eyes. “Just hot.”

Jonah glanced toward Asher and Madeline, who were mid-cuddle at the edge of the terrace. “Or just gutted?”

“Don’t start.”

He held up his hands. “Not judging. Just—damn, Hart. This one’s rough.”

She sipped her drink. “I’m fine. I said yes. I’m doing this.”

Beck appeared beside her a moment later, quiet as always. “You shouldn’t have said yes.”

“I had to.”

“No, you didn’t.”

“If I said no, he would’ve asked someone else.”

“Yeah. And?”

Ellis looked away. “I need to do this. I need to prove it doesn’t matter.”

“But it does.”

She didn’t answer. Just watched Asher laugh into Madeline’s neck like it was the easiest thing in the world.

Madeline turned a second later, eyes scanning the crowd—then landing on her.

Ellis froze.

The look was subtle. Polite. But sharp as a blade.

And just like that, she knew.

Madeline could tell.

Maybe not everything.

I'm craving connection, fellow redditors. I'm happy with one-off conversations or potentially building new friendships; let's see where we end up!

Lists are awesome, so here's one populated with random factoids about me! YAS!

* I love to read! I'm currently reading *The 48 Laws of Power*, and *Atomic Habits*. I have books all over the place and I'll read almost anything. My to-read pile is over 200 books and counting, because I'll probably add more tomorrow. I usually do. It's almost as tall as me (I'm 6'2"") and I affectionately call it Book Mountain^(tm). Yes, it's a problem. No, I'm not stopping. Books are life. And coffee.
* I love writing code and collect old programming books, particularly ones related to games and graphics. I feel like I'm in my element when I'm creating something and watching it evolve over time, especially if it's for a retro system. There are moments when I'll stop and think just how happy I am, while feeling a sense of euphoria and belonging, which I don't really get doing anything else. I haven't done it for a while and I really miss it. I feel out of touch with an important part of me.
* I experience social anxiety and sometimes depression. I'm a big fan of exposures and not hiding from how I feel, despite the intense need to sometimes; we don't grow if we don't face ourselves. I think I'm my biggest obstacle in life purely because of some patterns I'm stuck in, but I also think I'm my best asset, purely because I recognize I can change things if I really want to.

* Allergic to small talk. It's a special kind of hell. Phone calls, too. Shoot me now. I'm happy to send voice messages on occasion though. It's actually preferred when I'm in the middle of things.

* I hike and I'm one of those people that takes random photos during my day; flowers, fungi, books etc. If we hit it off, be prepared for photos :D I like sharing, it's fun. You're more than welcome to share too, though it's not expected.
* I'm a quiet idealist (and dreamer) who's usually lost in the idea of what could be, instead of being down in reality because reality sucks. I want to aim high and strive for what could be. I usually fail or when I get there it doesn't quite look how I envisioned it to be, but I have no regrets.
* I write on occasion (doesn't everyone?). Usually bad poetry, flash fiction or smut.
* Lover of clouds & sunsets, the shadows cast by leaves during the evening sun, people watching, petrichor, birds, and the euphoria of doing something I love. Summer storms are pretty great too.

Habitual book-sniffer, poster child for introversion. Single, for those that care. My pic: [https://imgur.com/a/sXt2vyY](https://imgur.com/a/sXt2vyY)

I'm craving connection, fellow redditors. I'm happy with one-off conversations or potentially building new friendships; let's see where we end up!

Lists are awesome, so here's one populated with random factoids about me! YAS!

* I love to read! I'm currently reading *The 48 Laws of Power*, and *Atomic Habits*. I have books all over the place and I'll read almost anything. My to-read pile is over 200 books and counting, because I'll probably add more tomorrow. I usually do. It's almost as tall as me (I'm 6'2"") and I affectionately call it Book Mountain^(tm). Yes, it's a problem. No, I'm not stopping. Books are life. And coffee.
* I love writing code and collect old programming books, particularly ones related to games and graphics. I feel like I'm in my element when I'm creating something and watching it evolve over time, especially if it's for a retro system. There are moments when I'll stop and think just how happy I am, while feeling a sense of euphoria and belonging, which I don't really get doing anything else. I haven't done it for a while and I really miss it. I feel out of touch with an important part of me.
* I experience social anxiety and sometimes depression. I'm a big fan of exposures and not hiding from how I feel, despite the intense need to sometimes; we don't grow if we don't face ourselves. I think I'm my biggest obstacle in life purely because of some patterns I'm stuck in, but I also think I'm my best asset, purely because I recognize I can change things if I really want to. I try to be responsible for how I feel.
* Allergic to small talk. It's a special kind of hell. Phone calls, too. Shoot me now. I'm happy to send voice messages on occasion though. It's actually preferred when I'm in the middle of things.
* I love art, Zdzislaw Beksinski and H.R. Giger are favourites. Street and ANSI art, too. Life is art.
* Big fan of 90s and 80s games. C64 anyone? Also fond of cozy games like Stardew Valley. I'm currently playing No Man's Sky and Coromon.
* I'm not into manga, anime, super hero movies, comics, Disney or JavaScript. It's cool if you are though, you do you. Recommend me a manga and I'll try it when I'm feeling adventurous. Maybe :P. I did go through a kdrama period though, so there's that. The Penthouse was *ridonkulous* but so good.
* I hike and I'm one of those people that takes random photos during my day; flowers, fungi, books etc. If we hit it off, be prepared for photos :D I like sharing, it's fun. You're more than welcome to share too, though it's not expected.
* I'm a quiet idealist (and dreamer) who's usually lost in the idea of what could be, instead of being down in reality because reality sucks. I want to aim high and strive for what could be. I usually fail or when I get there it doesn't quite look how I envisioned it to be, but I have no regrets.
* I write on occasion (doesn't everyone?). Usually bad poetry, flash fiction or smut.
* Lover of clouds & sunsets, the shadows cast by leaves during the evening sun, people watching, petrichor, birds, and the euphoria of doing something I love. Summer storms are pretty great too.

Tell me about you and what you're passionate about. I'm one of those people who loves hearing about what people are into. If I ask too many questions (it happens), I don't mean to interrogate. I'm just interested. :P

He doesnt listen to me. Like, at all. I have to repeat myself multiple times a day just to get through normal conversations. He cuts me off while talking sometimes and gets pissed when i do it. He doesnt take my opinion on some stuff that he asks my opinion for. And he doesnt even listen to anything i say.

Im starting to feel like i dont exist, unheard, and unwanted. Unloved.

We have been together for 10 years, married for 3. And he has never been like this, just the last 2 years. He still hugs me and kisses me and shows feelings for me and talks to me a lot, but doesn’t initiate for sec at all.

Ive gone through this topic with him dozen times and nothing ever changes. This happens on everything and i mean everything. For example, we went to pick some coffee beans and i showed him multiple ones i liked because he asked me, and he still picked the one he liked. I hate the one he picked and he knows it. Whenever i tell him to take the trash out or bring some stuff for our baby, he always says he forgot , i have to ask multiple times for him to actually do the stuff. Whenever i talk to him about anything, like the game we played together, he wanders off and then says “oh sorry can you repeat yourself “ or would nod as if he heard, and when i ask him anything he admits that he wasnt listening.

There are many many more examples of these and this happens like 10 times a day, im tired.

What cab i do to fix this? I need a solution because i cant do this anymore, i dont enjoy his company at all.

**TL;DR** my (25F) husband(26M) doesn’t listen to anything i say so i have to repeat myself multiple times just to have normal conversations with him and i feel unheard. ",1,1752269434.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

1lxiycw,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/1lxiycw/broken_arm_need_some_ideas_please/,Broken Arm.  Need some ideas please.,"Hi all.

TLDR: I have an upcoming trip to Hawaii next week and my son broke his forearm yesterday and I'm looking for fun, memorable, awesome Ideas to do with him and family on the trip, since we had to cancel/change a few plans.

We have had this trip planned for about 6+ months now and the whole family is excited. (Initial Itinerary listed below).  The other day my son was playing and took a fall and ended up breaking his forearm. (Displaced Radius fracture).  They were able to set it without surgery and get a cast put on.  Hopping for a waterproof cast to be put on next week the day before we leave, if allowed. His cast currently is above the elbow. His 8th birthday is while where are in O'hau and we had plans for individual surf lessons for the whole family. Needless to say he will not be able to go surfing and we don't want to go without him.  He also has a birthday party this weekend with friends and we had to ""modify"" the theme of it. (hard to play nerf and slip-in-slide with a broken arm)

Does anyone have any ideas on some other activities we could do as a family that an, almost 8 year old, would enjoy on his Bday? This will be my last state to visit and want to make it memorable for him and the whole family.

Current Itinerary:  
Honolulu - Hilton Hawaiian Village (5 days)  
Diamond Head Hike  
Surf lessons - Canceled  
Car drive around O'hau: (Dole Plantation, Laniakea Beach, Shark's cove snorkeling, Sunset Beach, Kualoa beach, Macadamia Farm, Byodo-in temple, Makapu'u, Halona Blowhole)  
Pearl Harbor Tour:   I'm a USMC Vet  
Iolani Palace  
Hula Show

  
Big Island (3 Days)

Thank you to anyone that could help provide some ideas that I might be missing.  We live right near the Atlantic so we are all used to the beach life. I'm really hopping we can get a waterproof cast to ease in the changes.  This is his first broken bone/cast and has been such a trooper. But I can tell he is really bummed about missing out on all the things he has been looking forward to with this trip.

1lxixct,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1lxixct/i_cant_get_excited_for_dates_anymore/,I can’t get excited for dates anymore,"30(M). I’ve realized by doing so, I only hurt myself. I hadn’t been on a date in close to a year. Sunday night I was taking about 10 minutes or so to do some swiping on Bumble. Lo and behold I got a match for the first time in four months.

It was going really well, I couldn’t remember the last time I got along with a woman like that. The conversation flowed in a way that made it feel like we’d known each other for a while instead of just a few hours. By Monday afternoon, a date was set up for that same evening. She suggested a coffee shop that had some nice outdoor seating.

The conversation in person went as smoothly as it did through texting. We had similar plans for our future (she didn’t want kids either) which has been basically impossible for me to find in a woman around my age.

I left the date feeling hopeful. When I got home she was already texting me about a second date. Here’s where things went wrong. I had never experienced a woman bringing up a second date completely unprompted by me. Any second date I set up I’ve always been the one to ask. I took this as a sign she was interested and let myself be excited. Our date was set up for next week. I picked out a restaurant by the water. 

Today she felt cold/distant in our conversation. After some deliberation I asked if anything had changed. Sure enough, she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship, blamed it on life being too busy at the moment.

I’m tired of this man. It’s always the same, different reasons for not continuing of course but always the same outcome. I took a break from dating because I was feeling burnt out, this has me questioning why I bothered to try again at all. 

I’m 30 years old and never had a relationship before. That sounds sad just typing it out. I wanted that to change, but it bothers me how much dating feels like a job interview, you can do everything right and still not get the offer.

1lxiuw8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lxiuw8,Frothing made easier,"I’ve got a 2003 Capresso C1000 super automatic. I’m sure it’s not as sophisticated as the modern machines but it still makes an excellent Crema coffee.

Unfortunately, I couldn’t really get the milk frothed to save my soul. I saw a video somewhere or even read it here, I don’t know… but I wanted to share what I found out and how it’s working for me.

The frother has a plastic tip that can be pulled up and down. Mine was kind of caked over on the inside so I didn’t really realize that.   So I pulled it apart and it didn’t really look like much, but there were a couple of tiny holes in the plastic. So I cleaned those out.

The secret is to pull up on the frother so that there’s a gap between the the plastic tip and its metal tube.  The second photo shows the gap, and the third photo shows the tip without the gap.

With the gap in the frother put the milk cup all the way to the bottom and let it heat up the milk for about 8 to 10 seconds. Then push the tip down to remove the gap being careful not to burn yourself.  

Tip the cup to a slight angle, and start frothing so the tip of the frother is just below the surface of the milk. 

After a few times, you’ll get the hang of it.  You’re trying to pull a little bit of air into the milk.  The milk should start to swirl gently and a gentle foam should start to rise. 

It didn’t swirl for me and definitely did not froth for the first five or six times though so don’t worry and keep trying. You can experiment with the tip so it’s barely in and barely out of the milk until you get the sweet spot where it really starts to froth.

That’s it! Full immersion for 8 to 10 seconds with the gap in the tip to heat the milk, then tip the cup with the gap removed and the frother just below the surface and began frothing. 

The main thing is don’t give up! It took me a while, but now it’s froths beautifully

We have been known eachother for 7 years, been friends for 4 and had on and off feelings for 4.

We were talking one day and she mentioned how she is done dating. I asked why and she says there are none thay meet her standards. Curious because I know her dating history pretty well I ask what those standards are. She says ME. 

I treat her like a gf and sometimes a bit princess and pampered. I do things like getting her coffee when she is stuck at work, gettint chocolate during that time of the month, going on her breaks from work with her because her normal break friend isnt there that day, or getting lunch/dinner with her. At first I did it because she needed it without how things ended in her last relationship. After a bit I realized I still liked her. Well after a bit I asked if she wants someone like me then why not me? I was told because I'm like her brother. 

A big thing is she hates people spending money on her and tries to pay me back. When we get a meal she will pay or we split. When I get her stuff she will give me a bit back. At first I would say don't but end up taking the money because even though I did it bc she needed it, I'm not dumb enough to piss her off. 

Now I am just a bit fed up with everything. I went through a family loss and to help me through it a bit and to get me out the house she took me on a hike. Her mom, uncle, and cousin were there. It was fun. She told me that she didn't give her mom a choice and said I was coming after telling her about what happened. Obviously mom agreed. I wasn't given too much of a choice either. No money was talked. Didn't know it cost to get in to the place but it did. Halfway through it she tells me I owe her $20 for getting in (that was the fee). This may be a me thing but if you all but physically force someone to go with you and incite them snd say nothing about money, what you're doing you aren't gonna charge them. 

Fast forward to last week when we talk about her date and I bring up she said she wants someone like me. I say why not me then and am told I'm a brother to her. I say something about I feel like a shitty person now and something else. She asks wdym. (We have a pretty open friendship where we say full truth). So I make sure and ask her if she wants it. She for once says no because she doesn't want our friendship to maybe change. For those of reddit all I was gonna say is just remind her about how much I do like her not just ad a friend and sister. I get it can change a friendship but when it hasn't yet I don't think it will. I've told her before and we started to try dating before shit happened in her life and we halted on that. And we were still like we are now just not as much princess treatment. 

So idk what to do? Like do I confront her about it all? Just stop doing it all and just be normal friends? Or is there something else because at this rate imma crash out.",1,1752268899.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I tried looking for subreddits that could be right for this topic, but I couldn’t find any..(please suggest if you know any, because I don’t use reddit that often.) It started yesterday at about 2:40 am when me and my partner started smelling a burnt coffee smell practically at the same time and in the matter of seconds we both got dizzy and in a state of confusion and fear. At the time what we did was get our dog and go as fast outside as we could and contacted emergency services. Medics and firefighters arrived at our location neither of the professionals understood us or felt the same sensations as we did. My partner was going with them and also felt nothing anymore it was all in a matter of seconds for us. In the end they did nothing and told us to calm down, but when we returned home after about an hour we felt it again also suddenly looking at each other confused and worried like before. Today at about 1:10 am same thing we went outside again and tried waiting it out, but didn’t call anyone. The symptoms and smells all are the same, I feel paranoid, confused and very dizzy. Google suggested that it could be gas leaks, mold or someone using drugs nearby. The thing is is that we don’t have any gas appliances and I checked for mold, but either way I don’t think mold smells like this. My boyfriend’s brother is a police officer yesterday morning he also suspected drug activity, because of the part of town where we live in, which is known for dangerous and illegal activities. I haven’t asked any neighbours yet if they experienced the same thing, honestly I’m a bit scared because of the dismissive acts of emergency service providers. They all looked at us like we were crazy. Tomorrow I’m planning on making some kind of board with the question and leaving it on the first floor in hopes that someone might also have this issue.

I left that job in oct'24 and decided to go for mba, I was told by a lot of people to not leave my job but I did it because I was influenced by my then bf that mba will transform my life, later I realised that I actually don't want to go for it, sat home for 9 months, got cheated by the same guy 🙂. 
 
Somehow I found a job and I was told that I'll be permanent with x company but I will need to work at client company Y. I had my training online, finally after a few weeks I went to the office for 4 days and I realised this role isn't for me as I was told that it's an onsite role but I didn't expect the work to be this crazy, I had to do a lot of climbing stairs, standing whole day, it's like an 11 hr physical work. They wouldn't even give me a chair to sit as they thought it won't look nice to pull a chair in a room full of training, they wouldn't let me complete my coffee if their coffee is completed,  they would ask me to leave it and work, when they themselves ask me to take a coffee if I need. I overshared to a colleague and probably he snitched too and on the 4th day I was asked that if I would continue here or not as this is the physical work and I need to make my mind, I was so overburdened, I said my whole body is paining,this is not L&D, this is office admin work, this is shit, the head and manager got angry and went away, eventually i discussed everything with company X as well. Meanwhile one of the managers comes to me tried to sweettalk me and i reaveled to her that I had a gap and now this 1 month experience, and who will hire me now, my life is spoiled, my career, my dream is ended. The manager snitched this to head and told her that I told my life is spoiled due to L&D( i never meant it this way).

I was called to submit my id and i apologised to them as I got rude but the head started talking as if I am asking her to take me back, I clarified that I am apologizing as i got rude, not because I want to work here as I was the first one to say that I don't want to. Everyone got up from their chair, told me how i talked something below the belt, i asked them to tell me what is it, they said that you said your life is ended due to L&D, I said that I never meant it this way, I said it in another way, that moment I realised how my words were twisted and presented to the head. I was told to leave and shown hand gestures, told that 'lets escort her out', 'madam ka aaj last day hai' , 'ghar jake sochna kya kra, aage jaha kaam kro aisa mat krna', I was begging them to not hold my docs or do anything legally, I was crying infront of 500 people, when they left me till the lift,  escorted me out , made me beg, I felt so helpless. 

I immediately called X company's manager and supervisor, ko told them everything, even the next day, I told them if they could hire me internally as I was ready to move to their location, but they didn't have any openings, i told them if this was a permanent role, I wouldn't have been harassed this bad or if the Y company's head was not a women, she wouldn't have the guts to throw me out like that as a male manager would be afraid to behave like this to a female employee but there are no law against her so she felt she could do anything to me. The X company asked me why I had mentioned that my career would be spoiled and eventually i would get married, I said that I need a job right now as I'm 24 and any parents would wait till 30, so I am free now to move but they thought that I'm doing a job to not get married, hence i clarified them that I'm ready to move but they said I need to put my papers as they have no openings. 

Also while I was conversing with Y company, they mentioned how they're doing this for 25 years, i mentioned that maybe I'm not cut for it but they took it on their ego and mentioned how a person has come all the way from Malaysia, they behaved as if I didn't exist in between these conversations, I felt so helpless in all those moments, the head is like the gossip queen and I worry, if she is going to blacklist me in other companies.
 
I know that I've been too expressive, I should have just gone home and sent a resignation but the way they harassed me isn't right either. They would have atleast done this drama in a enclosed space or maybe not if I wasn't a vendor to them. Now it's not just a gap but a 1 month of kala dhabha on my resume. 

Feel free to tell me where I'm wrong or where are they wrong or what can I do from here, I think I don't understand corporate rules, it's just me and my overthinking unemployed head now🥲 I keep thinking if I was wrong or their behaviour, how do I proceed with all this mess as I'm unable to process and move ahead with my job search.

I've been working on a project off and on for a while now and would really appreciate some feedback.

It's a smart container system for dry goods like flour, rice, beans, and coffee. The lid tracks what’s inside using sound. So there’s no need to scan anything or enter how much you’ve used. It just works quietly in the background.

I originally built it for myself because I kept forgetting what I needed or how much coffee I had left. It’s helped more than I expected, so I’m exploring whether this could be useful for others too.

You can check what you’re low on just by opening the app. If you’re running out of something, you can tap the item to either add it to your shopping list or order it directly from a store.

I’m trying to get a better sense of who this would help most. Maybe people who meal prep, folks into smart home setups, anyone trying to cut down on food waste, or maybe just people who want one less thing to think about.

AI and smart home integration is in the works

Initially planned to buy a Profitec Pro 600, but fell in love with the Drive when I had a look at it in store and pulled a shot.

Feels much bigger on the worktop than the MaraX (countertop here in Australia????) I’m Scottish 😂

It’s built like an absolute tank! Really is a thing of beauty. MaraX did me very well, even brought it with us from Scotland when we moved! It’s made copious amounts of coffee for us sleep deprived parents and our guests. Great steaming power for its size and takes up hardly any space.

Allground Sense grinder is awesome. Grind by weight is so good when doing back to back drinks. It is a little messy on smaller baskets, a few stray grinds will fly off the heap in the basket but a dosing ring stops that. Either way, with it being grind by weight it doesn’t affect the dose as it doesn’t stop until it hits the target weight. I’ve tested it a dozen times and the weight is absolutely bang on compared to two different scales I tested it on. It’s nice and quiet, built very well and looks cool in my opinion. Cleaning it is so good compared to the specialita as everything is tool-less and comes apart in seconds.

Look forward to getting it dialled in. Any tips for temperature and pre-infusion on these beasts for medium and medium-dark roasts?

But it is so hard for me to not communicate with this man. 

 He broke up with me at the beginning of April. We were together for 4 years. 

There were times when I told him that I couldn't talk to him. 
But of course, he would message me here and there. And inevitably I would message him back and everything would feel like normal again. 

A friend of mine recently passed away and so he has been checking on me and making sure that I'm okay etc. 

But as usual, that turned into more and more conversations.  And it felt like we were together again. I have seen him once but it was only for 20 minutes. We had a coffee and talked and that was it.

I told him so many times that I don't want to talk to him, but then we end up talking. It's to the point where I think he takes it as a joke when I say that.

I connect One Pro to my MacBook Pro and begin working. Then, I take a break in another room and have a cup of coffee. When I return after 30 minutes, Mac and One Pro are in sleep mode. I then put the One Pro on my face and re-established the connection with Mac, which is a standard procedure that works.

  
However, in the past few days, after entering sleep mode, when I put on One Pro and attempt to re-establish the connection, One Pro fails to start up. Mac appears to recognise One Pro connected, but One Pro does not start. The screen is simply dark. I had to disconnect and reconnect the cable to restart from the beginning. Until yesterday, One Pro started up with one attempt at reconnecting the cable. Today, however, no matter how many times I repeat this process, One Pro does not start up. I have tried connecting it to an iPhone and iPad, but the result was the same. I visited the firmware update page of Xreal, and it recognized the One Pro as connected, but the One Pro does not display any images. After making 10-15 further attempts to disconnect and reconnect the cable, One Pro finally started up, showing “Xreal” on the screen in the glasses. 

Does anybody have similar experiences or the same issue? I contacted the Xreal Support team, but I have not yet received a reply.",2,1752267954.0,Xreal,0,1.0,False

Not sure if this is the right sub or if I should be asking r/camping but here it goes anyways
Last September I went on a 10 day moose hunting/camping trip. This was my first and I was suggested to bring packet coffee for the mornings. 
I really like coffee, but I like it on the sweeter side and with flavors like Raspberry and whatnot. We have a LOT of small coffee shops here in Alaska and they all make sweeter mocha breve style coffee so thats what I tend to like.
Anyways I got Black rifles Vanilla bomb instant coffee and Dunkin Cold Caramel instant coffee. Both were pretty bitter and gross. 
Is trail coffee just inherently bad or is there some decent ones out there?
I'm going on a 3 day kayak camping duck hunting trip this September and need some sweeter predone suggestions or I might be taking my own sugar this time.

Detention after the ""Popcorn Toga Tea Party Chase"" (#StickySmoochSnafu was *everywhere*) reached legendary levels. Mineta and Kaminari weren't just cleaning; they were *re-building* the section of the UA wall they'd destroyed... *by hand*, under Cementoss's unamused gaze. Mineta's arms felt like overcooked noodles. Kaminari kept shocking himself with the rebar.

""Dude,"" Kaminari groaned, dropping a heavy brick. ""Can we *please* just... not do anything for a month? My brain's still fried from Toga's 'tingly' shock!""

Mineta wiped sweat (and lingering popcorn dust) from his brow. ""No way, Denki! This is it! The Grand Finale! Operation: Ashido Acquisition! I gotta propose!""

Kaminari stared. ""...Propose? Like... *marriage* propose? Mineta, we're fifteen! We nearly died like, six times this month! Mina thinks you're a walking tornado of trouble!""

""Exactly!"" Mineta puffed out his chest. ""She *laughs* at my trouble! She called me 'fantastically bonkers'! That's basically 'I love you' in Mina-language! I need a proposal so big, so bold, so... *me*, that she can't say no! But... I need help. A plan. A *foolproof* plan!""

Kaminari sighed, the weight of countless Mineta-plans-gone-wrong heavy on his shoulders. He looked at his friend's desperate, hopeful eyes. ""...Okay. Okay, fine. But it has to be SIMPLE. No cars. No explosives. No villains. Just... words. And maybe one *small*, non-sticky, non-electrified gesture.""

**Kaminari's ""Foolproof"" Plan:**
1.  **Location:** The UA rooftop at sunset. Romantic view, quiet(ish).
2.  **Setup:** A small, non-flammable picnic blanket. Two non-poisoned bento boxes (courtesy of begging Lunch Rush).
3.  **The Gesture:** A single, *normal*, non-stolen pink rose.
4.  **The Words:** Mineta simply tells Mina how he feels. Honestly. No grand speeches stolen from movies.
5.  **The Ring:** A temporary, plastic ""hero training"" ring from a gacha machine. (Symbolic! Not creepy! ...Hopefully).

""It's perfect, Mineta!"" Kaminari declared. ""Simple! Sweet! Sane! What could possibly go wrong?""

Mineta looked doubtful. ""No sticky balls? No flashing lights? No dramatic chase? Is it... *enough*?""

""It's *safe*,"" Kaminari stressed. ""Trust me. Simple is key.""

**The Calm Before the Purple Storm (It Doesn't Last):**

Sunset painted the UA rooftop in pinks and oranges. Mineta fidgeted nervously on the blanket Kaminari had laid out. He clutched the plastic rose and the gacha ring like they were live grenades. Kaminari gave him a thumbs-up from behind a ventilation shaft where he was hiding (for moral support... and potential medical intervention).

The rooftop door opened. Mina bounced out, her pink skin glowing in the warm light. She wore a simple, bright yellow sundress. ""Hey, Grape Juice! Denki said you wanted to talk? Cool view!"" She plopped down on the blanket, looking genuinely curious and relaxed.

Mineta's heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird. ""H-hey, Mina! Yeah! Uh... sunset! Pretty! Like... uh... your eyes! But pinker! The sunset, I mean! Not your eyes! Your eyes are awesome!"" *Smooth, Mineta. Real smooth.*

Mina giggled. ""Thanks? You okay? You look kinda... purple-er than usual.""

""FINE! Great! Never better!"" Mineta squeaked. He took a deep breath. *Simple. Honest.* ""Mina... I... I know I'm a mess. I cause chaos. I get chased by giants and villains and crazy knife girls. I break stuff. A lot.""

Mina nodded, a small smile playing on her lips. ""Yeah. You kinda do. It's... memorable.""

""But!"" Mineta pressed on, finding a sliver of courage. ""But through it all... you *laughed*. You didn't just laugh *at* me... well, okay, you did... but you laughed *with* the chaos. You called it 'amazing'. You called *me*... 'fantastically bonkers'."" He held out the slightly crumpled pink rose. ""And... and I like you, Mina Ashido. A lot. More than I like not being chased. More than I like not being in detention. You make the chaos... kinda fun. Will you... uh..."" He fumbled for the plastic ring box. ""...go out with me? Officially? Be my... Pinky to my Purple?""

Mina blinked, her yellow eyes wide. She looked at the rose, then at the earnest, terrified face of Minoru Mineta. A slow, warm smile spread across her face, brighter than the sunset. ""Grape Juice... you really are something else. Asking me out with a plastic ring and a stolen picnic after saving me from villains and asking out *other* villains? That's..."" She paused, the smile turning into a grin. ""...Pretty darn bold! And honestly? Yeah. It *is* fun. So... okay!""

Mineta's jaw dropped. ""R-really?!""

""Really!"" Mina laughed, taking the rose. ""But on one condition: no more 'borrowing' hero cars or proposing to knife-wielding maniacs. Deal?""

""DEAL! A MILLION DEALS!"" Mineta yelled, jumping up, pure joy exploding inside him. He forgot the ring. He forgot Kaminari. He just wanted to hug her!

**Enter Mt. Lady (Because of Course She Does):**

Just as Mineta launched himself for a celebratory (and slightly awkward) hug, a giant shadow fell over the rooftop. A very familiar, very angry voice boomed across the sky.

**""THERE YOU ARE, YOU LITTLE GRAPE-STAINED WRINKLE!""**

Mt. Lady, on evening patrol, had spotted the tiny purple figure on the UA roof. The grudge from the ruined engagement cake (#NeverForget) burned eternal. She leaned down, her giant face filling the skyline, eyes narrowed. ""READY TO BE SQUISHED LIKE THE BUG YOU ARE?!""

**""SWEET MOTHER OF-- NOT AGAIN!""** Mineta shrieked, instinctively grabbing Mina's hand. ""RUN!""

**The Rooftop Scramble & The ""Gesture"" That Wasn't So Simple:**

Mineta and Mina bolted. Kaminari popped out from behind the vent, waving his arms. ""MT. LADY! NO! IT'S A SPECIAL MOMENT! HE JUST GOT A GIRLFRIEND!""

**""I DON'T CARE IF HE WON THE LOTTERY! HE OWES ME A CAKE THE SIZE OF A HOUSE!""** Mt. Lady roared, swiping a giant hand towards the fleeing teens.

Mineta panicked. Simple plan? Gone! Instinct took over. He scooped up the plastic ring box he'd dropped... and the picnic blanket... and the half-eaten bento boxes. He looked around wildly. Sitting near the roof access door was a large, folded weather tarp... and coiled beside it, a heavy-duty rescue winch cable used for training exercises.

A terrible, wonderful, *very Mineta* idea sparked.

""Denki! The winch lever! PULL IT ON MY MARK!"" Mineta yelled, shoving the bento boxes and blanket into Mina's arms. ""Mina! Hold this! And... trust me?""

Mina, caught between terror and laughter, nodded. ""Oh boy. Here we go again!""

Mineta grabbed the tarp, unfolding it messily. He threw it over the winch cable's hook. He then scooped up a handful of his sticky balls and hurled them *not* at Mt. Lady, but onto the tarp itself. They splattered, creating a giant, sticky purple bullseye.

""NOW, DENKI! PULL!"" Mineta screamed.

Kaminari, understanding dawning (and terrified), yanked the winch lever. The cable whirred to life, rapidly reeling in... the sticky tarp.

Mineta grabbed Mina, and with a surprising burst of strength (fueled by adrenaline and impending doom), he **JUMPED** onto the sticky bullseye on the tarp just as it lifted off the roof!

**""WHEEEEEEE!""** Mina yelled, a mix of fear and exhilaration.

**""GRAAAAAAAAAPE!""** Mt. Lady bellowed, swiping again... only to grab empty air as the tarp, with Mineta and Mina clinging on, soared upwards, lifted by the winch cable towards the roof's highest antenna tower.

But Mineta wasn't done. As they soared past Mt. Lady's furious face, he did the only thing that felt right. He held up the plastic ring box towards Mina, the tiny fake gem glittering in the sunset light.

**""MINA ASHIDO! WILL YOU OFFICIALLY BE MY CHAOTIC GIRLFRIEND?!""** he yelled over the wind whipping past them.

Mina, clinging to him and the sticky tarp, her pink hair flying, looked down at the tiny plastic ring, then up at Mineta's terrified but determined face. She burst out laughing, the sound bright and clear above the city noise. **""YES, YOU CRAZY GRAPE! YES! NOW DON'T DROP ME!""**

**The Broadcast Finale (Naturally):**

Unbeknownst to them, a news helicopter filming Mt. Lady's patrol had captured the *entire* thing:
*   The giant Mt. Lady roaring at the tiny teens.
*   Mineta's frantic tarp-and-winch escape plan.
*   The pair soaring through the air on a sticky purple sail.
*   Mineta proposing mid-air while clinging for dear life.
*   Mina's laughing ""YES!""

The footage went viral instantly. **#StickyProposal #GrapeGetsTheGirl #MtLadyVsLove**

**UA Common Room: Explosive Reactions**

The TV showed the helicopter footage. Silence. Then...

**Mina's Friends:**
*   **Kirishima:** ""WHOOOOOOO! HE DID IT! MID-AIR PROPOSAL ON A STICKY TARP! THAT'S THE MANLIEST, MOST UNMANLY, PLUS ULTRA ROMANTIC THING EVER! GO MINETA!"" Tears streamed down his face as he punched the ceiling.
*   **Jiro:** Grinned, plugging her jack in. ""Yep. She said yes. Sounds happy. Mineta sounds like he's gonna puke. Classic.""
*   **Tsuyu:** ""Ribbit. He finally asked. While escaping Mt. Lady. On a tarp. It's very... Mineta. Congrats, Mina-chan.""
*   **Hagakure:** ""SO ROMANTIC! IN A TERRIFYING, STICKY WAY! I WANT A TARP PROPOSAL!""
*   **Uraraka:** Floated off the couch, tears in her eyes. ""It's so SWEET! And DANGEROUS! But mostly sweet! CONGRATS MINETA-KUN! MINA-CHAN!"" She hugged the floating air where Hagakure probably was.
*   **Momo:** Sighed with relief, creating celebratory party poppers. ""At least he didn't damage any *new* infrastructure this time. Mostly. Congratulations are in order!""

**The Boys:**
*   **Bakugo:** Stared, utterly dumbfounded. No explosion. No yelling. Just... shock. Then, slowly, a vein pulsed on his forehead. **""...HE... HE ACTUALLY... WITH A TARP... AND THE GIANT LADY... AND SHE SAID... *YES*?!**"" He finally exploded, blasting the new coffee table (replacing the last one). **""THAT DAMN GRAPE FREAK DOESN'T DESERVE A GIRLFRIEND! HE DESERVES TO BE LAUNCHED INTO THE SUN! DIE! DIE! DIE!""** Kirishima and Sero tackled him again.
*   **Midoriya:** Muttering at warp speed, tears streaming. ""The improvisation! Using the winch and his quirk defensively! Proposing under extreme duress! Mt. Lady as an unintentional catalyst for emotional confession! The public declaration! The sheer unpredictability! This is the most unconventional, high-stakes courtship ritual ever documented! Kacchan, please stop exploding the furniture!""
*   **Todoroki:** Stared at the screen. ""...He proposed mid-air while escaping a giant. With a plastic ring."" He blinked slowly. ""Father is going to spontaneously combust."" He took a long sip of water.
*   **Tokoyami:** ""Love blooms even amidst the shadow of the gargantuan! Dark Shadow recoils from the sheer... public display!"" Dark Shadow peeked out. ""But... congrats, tiny sticky dude! Ribbit?""
*   **Iida:** Was frozen. Then, his arms began chopping mechanically. **""UNSANCTIONED USE OF TRAINING EQUIPMENT! UNSAFE ROOFTOP ACTIVITY! PUBLIC DISTURBANCE! UNAUTHORIZED AERIAL MANEUVERS! PROPOSING WITHOUT PRIOR PERMISSION SLIP! THIS... THIS...""** He saw Mina's laughing face on the screen, clearly happy. He deflated slightly. ""...violates numerous safety protocols. However... congratulations on your mutual affection declaration, Mineta-kun, Ashido-san."" He fainted backwards, but with a slight smile this time. Sato caught him.
*   **Kaminari:** Watching from the roof access door below the antenna, gave a shaky thumbs-up to the dangling couple. ""You did it, buddy! You crazy, sticky, tarp-flying lunatic! You did it!""

**The Teachers Watch (Suffering):**

*   **Aizawa:** Stood on a nearby roof, capture scarf ready. He watched Mineta and Mina land safely (if messily) on the antenna platform, Mt. Lady below shaking her fist. He didn't move. He just sighed, the longest, most exhausted sigh of his life. He pulled out his phone, texting Nezu: *Detention for newly formed couple. 6 months. Roof cleaning duty. And couple's counseling.*
*   **Midnight:** Watching the news in the teacher's lounge, fanned herself dramatically. ""Oh my! How daring! How romantic! How utterly reckless! Young love on a sticky flytrap! I approve! Mostly!""
*   **Present Mic:** ""YEEEEEEAH! LOVE TAKES FLIGHT, LITTLE LISTENER! WAY TO STICK THE LANDING! WOOOOO!""
*   **All Might:** Watching on a small screen, smiled weakly. ""Young Mineta... truly embodies... the unpredictability of youth. I need a nap.""

**The Happy(ish) Landing:**

Mineta and Mina sat on the small antenna platform, legs dangling, the city lights twinkling below. Mt. Lady, realizing she couldn't reach them without destroying UA property (and facing *more* paperwork), stomped off, muttering threats about eternal cake vengeance.

Mineta finally slipped the plastic gacha ring onto Mina's finger. It was comically large. ""So... uh... girlfriend?""

Mina grinned, holding up her hand with the ridiculous ring. ""Chaotic girlfriend to a chaotic boyfriend."" She leaned over and gave him a quick, surprising kiss on the cheek. ""Just promise me our dates involve *slightly* less running from giants and villains?""

Mineta turned bright purple, touching his cheek. ""Deal! Maybe... just a little running? For fun?""

Mina laughed, the sound echoing over the rooftops – the same bright, amazing laugh that had started it all. ""Oh, Grape Juice. With you? I think a *little* running is guaranteed.""

Down below, Kaminari finally started breathing again. Mineta Minoru: Disaster Magnet, Menace to Society, Detention King... had a girlfriend. Against all odds. Through pure, unadulterated, sticky chaos. Kaminari smiled. It was the most Mineta thing possible. Now... how to explain the bento stains on the rescue tarp to Cementoss? The chaos, it seemed, was just beginning. But maybe, just maybe, it was the good kind of chaos now. As long as Mt. Lady didn't find out where they were going for their first date.",2,1752267182.0,ChurchOfMineta,2,1.0,False

I signed up because I do most of my grocery shopping and random household stuff at Walmart anyway, so it felt like a no-brainer. I figured I might as well get something back from all the money I’m already spending.

The first time I used it was actually on a late-night Walmart run, around 11PM, after I realized I had no coffee for the next morning (panic mode). I ended up grabbing like $80 worth of stuff because that’s how Walmart trips always go. A few days later I checked the app and saw I got 5% back because I used it through Walmart’s website with pickup. I didn’t even realize that was a thing at first but now I’m hooked. I’ve been placing my orders online and just picking them up on the way home from work.

So far, I like how easy it is to track everything through the Capital One app. I also used the card on a gas station run and got 1%, which isn’t amazing, but better than nothing. I’m still trying to figure out if the rewards are actually good long-term or just decent for someone who shops at Walmart a lot.

Has anyone used this card for more than just Walmart stuff? Is it worth keeping once that initial 5% period ends? Curious what other people think or if I should eventually switch to something with better overall rewards.",1,1752267176.0,credit_cards,0,1.0,False

Mineta Minoru was *supposed* to be lying low. Detention after the Great Sports Car Chase (#PinkPerilPurge was *still* trending) felt like an eternity scrubbing gum off sidewalks under Aizawa's sleep-deprived death stare. Even Kaminari, usually his partner-in-crime, was giving him a wide berth after nearly becoming extra-crispy Sparky.

But Mina Ashido... she'd *laughed*. A lot. When the whole class watched the news, she'd laughed until tears streamed down her pink cheeks. ""Grape Juice,"" she'd gasped, wiping her eyes, ""you are a *walking disaster zone*! It's terrifyingly amazing!"" That laugh... that *amazing*... it sparked a tiny, dangerous ember in Mineta's heart. He needed to see it again. He needed... a **gift**.

Specifically, the limited-edition ""Alien Queen"" headphones Mina had been drooling over. Bright pink, horn-shaped, ridiculously expensive. Mineta, fueled by desperate affection and the IQ of a concussed squirrel, hatched **Plan: Surprise Sound (Operation: Borrow & Buff)**.

**The Sneaky Snatch (Or So He Thought - Take Two - With More Tripping):**

Mineta knew Mina kept her allowance money hidden in a sparkly pink pencil case. ""Borrowing"" just enough felt... romantic adjacent! He waited for chaos – Bakugo yelling about weights, Midoriya muttering stratagems, Uraraka accidentally floating Iida. Perfect cover.

Using his sticky balls, Mineta scaled the dorm wall like a determined, purple tick. Mina's window was open! Luck! He wiggled through, landing silently on her fluffy pink rug... directly onto a rogue, sparkly hairclip. **""YOWCH!""** He yelped, hopping on one foot, then froze. Silence. Phew. He spotted the headphones *on her desk!* And the pencil case! He grabbed the headphones... just as the door opened.

Panic! He dove into Mina's closet, burying himself under a mountain of colorful clothes and fuzzy slippers. He peeked out as Mina bounced in, humming. She reached for the headphones... frowned. ""Huh? Where'd my 'phones go? Did they grow legs?"" She shrugged. ""Meh, probably Kirishima borrowed them. Kiri! Training time!"" She bounced out.

Mineta scrambled out, clutching the headphones. Success! He bolted for the window... tripped spectacularly over a discarded pom-pom... and tumbled headfirst out the window! **""WHAAAAAAAAA!""** He screamed, unleashing a wild barrage of sticky balls in pure panic. They splattered everywhere – wall, grass, a startled squirrel (now glued mid-nut-bury), forming a bouncy net. *BOING! BOING! THUD!* He landed, grass-stained but alive. The headphones, however, flew from his grasp, landing with a *plop* near the UA perimeter wall... right as a dark, oily portal opened.

**The League's Very Bad, No Good, Sticky Day (Now With Extra Mineta):**

Shigaraki Tomura stepped out, scratching his neck. ""Stupid heroes. Stupid bright... ooh, shiny?"" He spotted the pink headphones. ""Junk?"" He reached to decay them.

**""NO! MY MINA'S EARS!""** Mineta shrieked, forgetting villains. He charged, a tiny purple cannonball, and launched himself, latching onto Shigaraki's leg with arms, legs, and teeth like a deranged koala. **""LET GO, YOU MANNEQUIN-HANDED JERK!""**

**""GYARGH! WHAT THE--?! GET OFF, YOU ANNOYING PURPLE PUSTULE!""** Shigaraki yelled, shaking his leg violently. Mineta flailed, unleashing another wild spray of sticky balls:

*   **Splat!** One glued Shigaraki's free hand to his own neck. **""GAH! MY NECK ITCH! RELEASE ME!""**
*   **Sploosh!** Another hit Dabi square in the face, covering his staples and one eye. **""HEY! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS PURPLE SLIME?! IS IT ACID?! IT BETTER NOT MESS UP MY STAPLES!""** He pawed at it, blue flames flickering dangerously.
*   **Gloop!** One smacked Toga Himiko right on her chest as she skipped out. **""Eek! Sticky!""** she giggled, poking it. **""Is it blood? Tastes... plasticky! Like cheap candy! Fun!""**
*   **Schlorp!** Another landed inside Kurogiri's portal. **""This viscous substance is adhering to the spatial vortex parameters. Highly inconvenient,""** Kurogiri droned, his mist shimmering as he tried to dislodge it.
*   **Whoops!** Mr. Compress stepped out, slipped on a stray ball, windmilled his arms, and accidentally compressed a startled Spinner into a marble. **""Deucedly slippery! Apologies, Spinner old chap!""** The marble rolled under a bush.
*   **Clang!** Magne swung her giant magnet, stepped on a ball, stumbled, and stuck it firmly to Kurogiri's metal brace. **""Oops! Sorry, Kurogiri! Magnet's being clingy today!""**

Chaos reigned, courtesy of one panicked, sticky grape. Mineta, still clinging to Shigaraki's leg, looked up... and froze. Toga Himiko was leaning over him, her head tilted, a wide, unnerving grin splitting her face. Her eyes gleamed yellow.

**""Oooh, you're the sticky boy!""** Toga chirped, her voice sugary sweet. **""You made such a mess! It's kinda cute... in a messy, grapey way!""** She poked his cheek with a finger. **""Are you tasty under all that panic?""**

Mineta's brain, already overloaded with terror, short-circuited completely. Toga was... weird. And creepy. But also... kinda... close? And wearing that school uniform? A familiar, deeply inappropriate instinct surfaced, overriding survival. He leered, his eyes momentarily glazing over. **""Heh... well, y'know, Toga-chan... if you wanna find out how *sweet* I am... maybe we could... uh... get some tea sometime? Without the stabby-stabby?""**

The effect was instant. Toga's grin widened impossibly, showing too many teeth. Her eyes dilated. **""Tea? With *me*? You're asking *me* out?!**"" She squealed, clapping her hands, momentarily forgetting the sticky ball on her chest. **""That's SO FUN! I LOVE tea! Especially with a splash of... ADRENALINE!""** She whipped out a gleaming knife, her expression shifting from playful to terrifyingly intense. **""Let's play RIGHT NOW, Sticky Boy! Catch me if you can... or I'LL CATCH YOU!""** She lunged.

**""SWEET MOTHER OF--!""** Mineta shrieked, sheer terror blasting away the pervy thoughts. He finally let go of Shigaraki's leg and scrambled backwards like a crab on fire, his sticky balls popping out behind him in a frantic, panicked trail. **""DENKI! HELP! SHE'S CRAZY AND CUTE AND SHE WANTS TO STAB ME!""**

**The Great Perilous Popcorn Chase:**

Toga gave chase, giggling maniacally, her knife glinting. **""Come baaaack, Sticky Boy! We haven't had tea yet! Just a little sip! PROMISE IT WON'T HURT... MUCH!""**

Mineta bolted, not towards the dorms, but blindly towards the main UA gates, trailing sticky balls like terrified breadcrumbs. Toga skipped after him, easily hopping over the balls, humming a creepy tune.

Dabi finally ripped the ball off his face. **""I'M GONNA TURN THAT LITTLE PERVE INTO ASH!""** He unleashed a wave of blue fire... that singed the back of Shigaraki's coat as he struggled to unglue his hand from his neck.

**""WATCH IT, YOU ARSONIST!""** Shigaraki roared.

Kaminari, drawn by the screams, arrived just in time to see Mineta fleeing a knife-wielding schoolgirl and Dabi preparing to incinerate everything. **""OH COME ON!""** He unleashed a massive, uncontrolled **INDISCRIMINATE SHOCK: 1.3 MILLION VOLTS!** The blast hit:
*   Dabi (jolted, interrupting his fire).
*   Toga (her hair stood straight up, she yelped, ""Tingly!"").
*   Kurogiri's portal (flickered violently, destabilized by the sticky ball and electricity).
*   The base of the UA security wall (shorted out with a shower of sparks, collapsing a section with a **CRASH!**).
*   A passing ""Mr. Yummy's Popcorn"" cart parked just outside the newly created hole in the wall. The cart short-circuited, exploding kernels everywhere like shrapnel. **""MY POPCORN!""** wailed the vendor.

**The Road Runner & The Psycho Coyote (Live on TV!):**

The gaping hole in the wall revealed the chaotic scene to the street... and the **five** news vans already staked out after the car chase. Cameras swung into action.

**Nationwide Broadcast:**
The screen split:
1.  **Mineta:** Scrambling out the hole, covered in grass stains and terror, trailing sticky balls. He slipped on a patch of spilled popcorn, face-planted, scrambled up, and blindly commandeered the **popcorn cart**! He couldn't drive it, so he just *pushed* it frantically down the road, popcorn flying everywhere like a salty blizzard. **""GET AWAY! SHE'S GONNA STAB MY GRAPES OFF!""**
2.  **Toga:** Skipping gleefully after the cart, dodging popcorn projectiles, licking her knife. **""Faster, Sticky Boy! The tea's getting cold! Or maybe I'll just have POPCORN INSTEAD! WITH GRAPE JUICE SAUCE!""** She cackled.
3.  **The League:** Shigaraki finally unglued, furiously scratching his neck, chasing after Toga. **""TOGA! GET BACK HERE! WE'RE LEAVING!""** Dabi stomped after, trailing smoke, trying to light popcorn kernels on fire out of spite. Kurogiri struggled to maintain a sputtering portal near the hole. Mr. Compress was on hands and knees in the popcorn-strewn street, searching for Spinner's marble. Magne tried to pull her magnet off Kurogiri.
4.  **Kaminari:** Staggered out the hole, hair smoking, eyes spinning, muttering ""Popcorn... lightshow... stabby tea..."" He tripped over a sticky ball and fell face-first into a pile of exploded popcorn.

The news anchor sounded like he was having a stroke: **""UNBELIEVABLE! LIVE AT UA HIGH! THE LEAGUE OF VILLAINS ARE... CHASING A STUDENT WITH A POPCORN CART?! STUDENT MINETA APPEARS TO HAVE... PROPOSED A DATE TO VILLAIN TOGA HIMIKO?! SHE SEEMS... RECEPTIVE?! IN A HOMICIDAL WAY?! KAMINARI IS DOWN! POPCORN IS FLYING! WHAT IS HAPPENING?! IS THIS A VILLAIN ATTACK OR A BAD COMEDY ROUTINE?!""**

**Back in the Dorms (Popcorn Pandemonium):**

The common room was bedlam.

**Mina:** Pointed at the screen, laughing so hard she couldn't breathe. **""HE... HE ASKED... TOGA... OUT... FOR TEA... TO *DISTRACT* HER?! AND NOW HE'S RUNNING WITH A POPCORN CART?! OH MY GOD, GRAPE JUICE! YOU ABSOLUTE LEGEND! HE'S GONNA DIE! HE'S GONNA DIE LAUGHING! I CAN'T!""** Tears streamed down her face as she pounded the couch.

**Kirishima:** ""WHOOOOOA! MINETA'S USING A POPCORN CART AS A SHIELD?! THAT'S THE UNMANLIEST, MOST BADASS CHICKEN RUN I'VE EVER SEEN! GO GRAPE! DON'T LET THE CRAZY GIRL STAB YOUR JUICE! ...Wait, did he really ask her out?!""

**Bakugo:** Exploded the coffee table. **""THAT DAMN GRAPE! HE'S FLIRTING WITH VILLAINS NOW?! AND USING POPCORN AS A WEAPON?! THAT'S MY MOVE! DIE! DIE! DIE! I'LL KILL THE LEAGUE, THE GRAPE, AND THAT POPCORN VENDOR! KIRISHIMA! GET OFF ME! LET ME AT 'EM!""** Kirishima and Sero wrestled the fuming Bakugo to the ground.

**Iida:** Was rigid, steam literally whistling from his ears. His arm chops were a blur. **""ILLEGAL QUIRK USAGE! UNAUTHORIZED VILLAIN NEGOTIATION (ROMANTIC?!)?! THEFT OF A POPCORN VESSEL! ENDANGERMENT OF CORN-BASED SNACKS! RECKLESS ABANDON OF A FRIEND IN A POPCORN PILE! THIS... THIS DEFIES ALL REGULATIONS! RECIPROBURST! RECIPRO... *SYSTEM OVERLOAD!*""** He fainted backwards, stiff as a board, into Sato's arms.

**Midoriya:** Was scribbling furiously, muttering at mach speed. ""Toga's apparent amusement at Mineta-kun's advances! The tactical... or perhaps hormonal... deployment of flirtation under duress! Popcorn as an improvised area-denial weapon! Dabi's pyromaniacal reaction to snack foods! The structural weakness of the wall exacerbated by Kaminari-kun's quirk interacting with Mineta-kun's adhesive residue! Shigaraki's dermatological distress! This is... this is a goldmine of unpredictable combat data!""

**Todoroki:** Stared blankly at Mineta pushing the popcorn cart. ""...He asked the knife girl for tea."" He blinked slowly. ""Father is going to have an aneurysm."" He took a long sip of his cold soba broth.

**Aizawa:** Appeared in the doorway. He took one look at the screen: Mineta frantically pushing a popcorn cart pursued by a giggling knife-wielder, his other problem child face-down in popcorn, and the League floundering in a mix of sticky balls and exploded kernels. His capture scarf lifted slightly. His eyes didn't just glow red; they looked like portals to hell itself. He didn't sigh. He didn't speak. He turned slowly and walked away, radiating an aura of such profound, universe-weary resignation that the room plants visibly wilted.

**Tsuyu:** ""Ribbit. Mineta caused the League of Villains a lot of trouble. Kaminari is face-down in popcorn. Toga-chan seems... interested. Mina-chan, your headphones are near the hole in the wall.""

**Jiro:** Plugged into the wall, wincing. ""Yeah... Shigaraki sounds like he's gargling broken glass. Dabi's swearing about popcorn in his boots. Toga's singing 'Tea for Two (and Knives for One!)'. Kurogiri sounds like a broken GPS. Kaminari's... snoring? Mineta's... screaming about 'sweet grapes' and 'hot tea'?""

**On-Site Snack-Based Chaos:**

Shigaraki finally caught up to Toga, grabbing her by the collar as she was about to pounce on the popcorn cart Mineta had abandoned behind a fire hydrant. **""TOGA! ENOUGH PLAYING WITH YOUR FOOD! KUROGIRI! PORTAL! NOW!""**

Kurogiri strained. **""The adhesive... the popcorn interference... the electrical surge... recalibrating spatial coordinates...!""** With a final, smoky *whumpf*, the portal swallowed the League – Shigaraki dragging a pouting Toga (who blew a kiss at the popcorn-covered Mineta), Dabi kicking popcorn, Mr. Compress clutching Spinner's marble and a handful of buttered kernels, Magne finally freeing her magnet. They vanished.

Mineta lay panting behind the hydrant, covered in popcorn, grass stains, and sheer terror. Kaminari was buried in a popcorn mound, only his sparking hair visible. Security bots, teachers, and the weeping popcorn vendor swarmed the area. Mina was the first student through the hole, skidding to a stop in the popcorn-strewn street.

She looked at the destroyed wall, the scorch marks, the sticky balls, the scattered popcorn, the half-demolished cart, the buried Kaminari, and the trembling, popcorn-encrusted Mineta. Her eyes met his.

She burst out laughing again, the sound bright and clear amidst the salty carnage. **""Grape Juice,""** she grinned, shaking her head, plucking a piece of popcorn from his hair. **""Asking Toga out? Running from her with a popcorn cart? Saving my headphones from Shigaraki? You are... utterly, completely, fantastically *bonkers*. And somehow... you pulled it off?""** She gestured to the headphones, miraculously unharmed near the wall. **""Thanks, I guess? Now... let's dig Denki out before he suffocates in snack food. Aizawa-sensei is gonna *love* this.""**

Mineta, despite the imminent threat of being turned into a human eraser by Aizawa, managed a weak, popcorn-dusted smile. She was laughing. She was talking to him. She touched his hair! Operation: Borrow & Buff? Catastrophic success! Now, if only he could explain the whole ""asking Toga for tea"" thing... Maybe he could say it was a cunning distraction? Yeah. That might work. Maybe. He hoped Aizawa-sensei appreciated cunning distractions involving homicidal schoolgirls and popcorn carts.",2,1752267141.0,ChurchOfMineta,1,1.0,False

I love your videos and bingeing everything while doing my chores. I have already written those stories but, didn’t like the way I wrote them and some more stuff came up so here goes nothing.

I have not one, not two, but *three* wedding stories (and more). So buckle up. These stories revolve around how three close friends got married in 2024, and everything that followed. All names are changed for obvious reasons. The friends are Dolores, Ellie, and Brianna (me). We’re all women and were 26 when these events happened. We all met in the first day of high school and became the closest friends immediately, it was like sitcom. Dolores and I were especially close – became neighbors at one point. After high school Dolores and I attended same uni and Ellie started the uni across the street :’) We practically lived in each other’s pockets for years. Our moms became close too, especially since Dolores’s dad worked abroad and her extended family lived in another city.

**Wedding 1: Dolores’s Wedding**

Some context: Dolores had been dating Sebastian (30M), whom she met in university. After graduation, they decided to get married, a very standard love story of a uni couple. By that point, all three of us were working as doctors in different cities. It was our first time living far from home and each other. I was feeling extremely lonely and burnt out. We were all working 24-hour shifts but I was away from my parents house for the first time, trying to adapt working and taking care of a house all at once. My then-boyfriend-now-husband Brandon (27M) lived in another city too. I was depressed—and what hurt me most was that Dolores never checked in. She took days to respond to my messages and stopped sharing her life with us. I told myself she was too busy (yes, I told myself she was too busy to check a reel in insta or send a “Good, how about you?” text.)

Let’s get to events unfolding. Closer to her engagement party I had just had a minor nose surgery, but less than a week later, I got dressed, packed up, and traveled with Ellie to Dolores’s hometown (let’s call it K) for her engagement. It was a small family gathering. I helped out with everything I could. I also want to mention her whole family, knows me, likes me as far as I know and I love them. I have been there before and I would do absolutely anything for my friend.

That night, Dolores invited us to stay over. We were tired and thought it might be a nice chance to reconnect. We slept in the same bed, some gossip and chitty chat. We talked about how we’d drifted and promised to stay in touch. This was early 2023.

Sometime passed and Ellie got engaged. Dolores had moved back to our hometown (let’s call it A) by the time of Ellie’s engagement, while I was still in a different city (B). Ellie’s engagement went smoothly. But at the event, I noticed Dolores looked visibly upset.

I pulled her aside – so that I wouldn’t distract Ellie from her engagement. I let Dolores open up. This is what she told me:

She and Sebastian had decided not to have a wedding party and to use the money to buy a house instead. Her family supported that but still wanted to host a traditional henna night (a women-only Turkish pre-wedding celebration). Sebastian’s family objected, saying there couldn’t be a henna night without a wedding party (keep in mind, bride’s family pays for everything henna-related). Things escalated. Her family insisted on having it. His family refused. Sebastian sided with his parents and even blamed Dolores’s family.

I asked her, “Do *you* want the henna night?” She said yes. I told her she and Sebastian needed to come to a decision together and present a united front. Also, Sebastian not backing her up and picking a side is a little bit of a red flag, but she should give him a chance to reconcile.

In the following weeks, she started opening up about Sebastian’s toxic behavior—how unsupported she felt, how confused she was about marrying him.

A week before their scheduled civil ceremony, I went to city A to support her. Her family was against the marriage. Dolores kept saying, “Everything was fine until our families got involved.” But I said, “Sebastian not being supportive isn’t your family’s fault.”

I was honestly getting frustrated. My best friend was in pain and still considering marrying someone who clearly didn’t respect her.

Ellie and I stayed with her for a few days coming up to her wedding day. After long talks, Dolores finally decided to call it off. She said, “I might feel weak—don’t let me text him.” We agreed.

During that time, I realized something that hurt more than I expected: she hadn’t been busy all those months. She had just chosen not to respond to my messages and simply ghosted me and Ellie. That stung. But I didn’t bring it up—Dolores was already heartbroken.

On what would’ve been their wedding day, Sebastian showed up at her house. He wanted to talk to her and her mom. Her mom didn’t want to host him inside, so we all got into our cars to meet at a nearby park.

When Sebastian saw Ellie and me getting in a car, he shouted, “You’re not coming.” I said, “We won’t be part of the conversation, but we’re not leaving her alone.” (I remember what has been said word to word.)

He took off his ring, threw it into Ellie’s lap, and yelled, “Give this to her!” Then he left.

We went to the park, but he never showed. Instead, he called her mom and *verbally attacked* her on the phone. Dolores heard everything he has said to her mom. We spent the rest of the day trying to distract Dolores and lift her spirits. I even found a kitten from one of my friends the same day, since she was longing for a pet forever.

A few months later, she still barely talked to me. I tried to reconnect with her, sent her multiple messages explaining how hurt I was. She always apologized, said she understood, but *nothing changed*.

Then she got back together with Sebastian. They decided to get married in 2024. She asked us – me and Ellie – to be witnesses.

I told her I would only agree if Sebastian apologized for shouting at us. I suggested a coffee meetup so we could talk. She never followed through. Sebastian and Dolores even came to the city I work at; she just stopped at my hospital to say hello and Sebastian didn’t leave his car, didn’t even say Hi—and *ignored me* completely.

So I declined to be her witness at her wedding.

At the wedding, Dolores sat Ellie and me at a completely separate table, far from the rest of her university and high school friends. No explanation.

Also, our mutual friend Nadine (26F) didn’t even say hello to us (another long and sad story for me). Dolores’s mom barely acknowledged my mom.

Despite my own wedding coming up soon after, neither Dolores nor her mom offered any help or support. I had even asked Dolores to be one of my bridesmaids. I sent her the dress color (this is as far as bridesmaids go in my country). She never responded.

That was when I accepted our friendship was over. But the thing is—I still miss her. If she ever reaches out and wants to tell her side of the story, I’d be open. I really want to keep our friendship, even if it’s not the same as what we once had. We were inseparable for years and I still tear up writing these words. She showed up at my wedding just to bring the wedding gift and we haven’t talked once since.

1lxhzzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1lxhzzo/dating_turned_into_serious_relationship_over_4/,"Dating turned into serious relationship over 4 months, had to break it off cause it was getting toxic","I met this guy through a serious dating site five months ago. I've been single for almost three years and never had a serious relationship before. He had been single atleast 7 years. We both were looking for marriage and serious relationship.

Everything started out great. I counted mystery lucky for finding somebody who is head over heels for me. All the love, attention, caring were new to me cause I never experienced this before. He was also over the moon with how much I loved and cherished him. He never made me feel doubt about his love for me, always validated and put me on a pedestal. 

Through out the day he kept messaging or calling just to stay close. He’s a calm, shy, soft-spoken guy and has this gentle quietness about him. Extremely introverted guy.

Physically and sexually, we’re incredibly compatible. The chemistry is intense, and he’s always been attentive to my needs. He always made sure I am satisfied.

We shared the same kind of love for movies, music, and pop culture. That helped us bond and made conversations easier in the beginning.

Family background was nice, he was educated and have good potential career wise. That was all I could ask for in a potential partner/husband, so I was happy in the beginning.

Above all, we loved each other very deeply. He is always my first serious relationship and I really imagined having a family, having kids, buying house and all with him. Our family were contacted each others, even my family went and met his parents. We are planning about wedding by next year. It was serious, especially considering our culture and tradition.

But things started to go nothing like I thought. From the beginning, he was very emotionally expressive once he started to open up, very straightforward with showing possessiveness or jealousy. Didn't hold back. If anything he feels sus, he asks without playing games. He has anxious attachment style while I am an avoidant.
It was full of drama but I will list out the cons.

1. His personality felt dull next to mine. I’m someone who thrives on fun, goofy, light-hearted energy—and if my partner is low-energy or uninspired, it rubs off on me. If the opposite person is boring I will be hella biring. I’m scared our life together would be boring even though I love being silly and playful.Most he done was listening to me going on and on about things, and if I stop he ask emotionally loaded questions about our relationship. That was how he wanted to spend our time together.

2. Physically, we didn’t match. I’m shorter, younger-looking, even if I am in late twenties. I am 28 he is 35. I am 60kg he is 95 kg. He looked older than he is, with full grey hair and extreme early balding. It bothered me more than I wanted to admit, especially because appearance matters to me. He mentioned about a hair transplant early on, but never followed through, think that was a lie to make me stay if I changed my mind based on appearance. None of this didn't felt like a big deal to me up until recently when other redflags started showing up.

3. The age gap seven years wasn't a big deal at first, but I later started to feel it. In our mindset, our maturity, and especially his old-school, conservative views.

 He was extremely possessive. I couldn’t even hang out with my guy friends without being questioned by him or him getting upset or literally getting emotionally so down. He would get upset over random instagram comments or even just beause I am chatting with my friends.


4. He had trust issues .I put my selfie as WhatsApp status visible only to him and my bestie—in between a fight, he accused me of seeking attention from any of my contacts.

I changed my profile picture—he asked if something changed between us.

If I was online but hadn’t replied immediately, he’d ask who I was talking to and doubt me, even when I shared screenshots of me talking to my friends/colleagues/simply ordering food through whatsapp

5. His insecurity drained me. He wanted a constant stream of messages and calls. We have a routine (which i happily done out of love in the beginning when I was so enthusiastic and with the freshness of a serious relationship for the first time) of me messaging him immediately after waking up every morning at 7.30, calling once I am ready for office and waiting for my colleague to pick me up, calling while I am getting my coffee at 10.30, messaging through out the day, calling before and after lunch or during lunch, calling while on my way to home from worm around 7, calling once I get home, and then calling at night once I settle in which will be usually like 2 hours til midnight. If any of this slightly stops, he notices and keep asking if anything changed. Calling home to parents become limited, no more time for cooking, for watching my favorite shows, or just simply relaxing. It was very taxing. 

6. My sleep, health, and peace suffered.I was going to bed at 2 AM, waking up tired and grumpy. I’m on 40 mg isotretinoin—I needed rest. I begged for earlier sleep, but even when he agreed, I’d still end up sleeping past midnight and he guilt tripped me saying I don't put in the effort for the relationship.I developed terrible under-eye circles, and I’m constantly exhausted. My body started acting out—my periods became irregular, bleeding lasted a month, and don't know if it'related, but I’ve developed PCOD.

Even if ask about my well-being and ask like he cares about me through out the day, he don't value or trust when I say I am busy with month end. He didn’t respect my work stress.During month-end, I’d be working till midnight and weekends non-stop. Still, he’d say I was distancing myself and make me feel guilty for not texting enough.He couldn’t accept that I’m not built like him—I need rest. 


7. I was terrified to tell him about my past relationship.He had already reacted so badly to me forgetting to mention an old proposal.

One weekend when I went to his place I was having periods, I couldn't have sex with him. He asked me if I am lying to get out of it. I was speechless, he apologized a lot later. Later when I was sleeping he was bored and also maybe because worried I am lying to get out of it, he looked through my phone cause he knows the security pattern, I never hid it from him using the pattern, my bad.

He didn't believe that it was a brief date and we cut ties when we realized it won't work out.I had to text the guy asking wierd question to prove we haven't done anything sexually. 

But it didn't end there, I was always on eggshells, cause I had a 6 months kinda situationship with a guy two years back, we met in person only once and had some intimacy. I had to come clean or he will find somehow. I used to have serious anxiety and I told him the truth. But again he was upset, but he didn't let go, even if I thought to leave the relationship. He was asking all the graphic details of the encounter I had which was not a pleasant experience at all. He guilt tripped me so bad, yet he didn't want to end our relationship. Then we reconciled,.decided to forget and forgive everything. But next day, he agin kept pressing me asking me if we met more than once and didn't believe me. I lost my shit and said I wanna leave this relationship, that was when I first thought about break up.

I was scared to go back to his place while I realized that he checked my phone while I was sleeping, I turned down his request to go back to his place after we met on the same weekend. He started getting all teary, with shaky voice being so dramatic in the public setting begging and pushing me to go to his place. Made it emotional asking why are you not coming, are you ending things, you must be feeling distant. Basically using emotion for manipulating.

This time I decided to leave and broke up, but got together the next week, he agreed to do counselling for trust issues but he didn't follow through that either, that made me feel kind of way.

8. We’ve broken up three times.The very first time, just two weeks in, he said I love you and he pressured me to decide about my response to that. When I needed time, he kept asking wondering what is taking so long to make a decision and kept pressuring me.I broke up when it got too much by the end of first month. But We missed each other terribly.We got back together, but again I felt suffocated. 

After i told him my decision now, he was begging, sad and furious in between, at the time he revealed he again snooped through my phone while we met last week and looked through my Instagram and saw that I searched a guys name in insta, he asked I am breaking up because of that guy. I was soooo done  at that point.


I blocked him everywhere, but he kept calling me from different numbers. I was coming home one day late night and saw him hanging out or looking out for me near our parking lot, I got scared don't know why and hided. I unblocked him and told him never do that again, never come again. He apologized a lot. He has been messaging through out the day ever since apologizing. Sometimes he is upset and ask every couple have issues and they work through that. Or that he improved a lot and I didn't give him enough chance to show the growth. Or says that I didn't really cared and how easily I have moved on. Sometimes I start questioning my self wondering if he has a point. Am I overreacting or quick to jump to a decision.

All my friends who came to know about this or my family were all against this relationship and they are relieved I am out of it. 

But it's difficult being the dumper. I act stone cold and distant but I cry myself to sleep every night. The emptyness or the void he made is disheartening. I miss him, his texts, calls, touch and just the feeling of someone out there looking out for me. Someone made for me. My other half. I miss that feeling.

How do I know if I made a right decision or am I gonna regret not going back?


**tl;Dr**4months into the relationship, got serious but realized he got trust issues and he is overly emotionally attached while I am not

So this one’s been sitting with me and I’m honestly still pissed off about it. Just need to know if I’m the asshole for how I reacted or if I was right to walk away.

I had just come off a breakup from a relationship that lasted just over two years. I was DJing one night and after my set a couple friends were like hey, come back and have a few drinks, keep the party going, talk music. I wasn’t really in the mood, kinda drained and still a bit down, but I figured maybe it’d be good for me. I’m pretty extroverted so sometimes being around people helps recharge me.

Ends up just being me and two girls. One is a friend of mine I’ve known for over a decade, let’s call her Sam. The other is her friend Laura, who I barely knew at that point. We head back to Laura’s place. All chill at first, we’re just hanging out, chatting about music. But I start realizing Laura’s actually super interesting. We got a lot in common. She had Kurt Cobain’s journals, which I read as a teenager. She plays guitar, same as me. Tons of shared taste. I even started wondering if Sam was trying to lowkey set us up.

At the same time, I was fresh off a breakup so I wasn’t trying to do anything stupid. Just enjoying the vibe. Then at some point Sam goes, my head’s spinning, I’m gonna lie down. I’m thinking alright, this is my cue to leave. Not tryna hang alone with someone I just met and I’m definitely not trying to hook up or do anything like that.

But Laura asked me to stay and chat for a bit. So I figured sure, why not. We end up talking for like 40min and yeah, we were vibing. Then she leaned in and started kissing me. I won’t lie, she’s extremely attractive and definitely my type, it still caught me off guard, but I went with it. Got heated fast, we ended up in her room, clothes started flying off.

And then I noticed the picture on the nightstand. Her and a guy, where the guy was dipping her on a sunset beach nose to nose; aka very clearly a couple photo, like not a brother or friend. I stopped everything right there and asked her straight up, are you with someone. She froze, then slammed the picture face down and started telling me no it didn’t work out, trying to keep kissing me / begging me not to stop, saying how ready to go she was. 
I wanted to stay so badly but it felt wrong. In that moment I just had a gut feeling. All the stuff I liked in the apartment, the books, the posters, the guitar in the corner, it hit me that it probably wasn’t even hers. I was like yeah no, he definitely lives here with you and you’re still with him.

I told her I wasn’t ok with it and started grabbing my clothes…she kept trying to pull me back into bed, touching me, kissing me, begging me to stay as o think she could tell I was conflicted or didn’t care…either way I said no more than once. When she realized I wasn’t gonna change my mind she went cold, completely flipped, starting cussing at me calling me pathetic. So I got the hell out of there fast.

The next day I messaged her in the afternoon after stewing about it all morning. Told her that didn’t sit right with me. I said look, you tried to cheat, whether we went through with it or not, and you need to tell your boyfriend or fiancé or whatever he is. I told her I wouldn’t lie about what happened if he asked, and that I thought it’d be better if it came from her. Said maybe he’d forgive her, maybe they could work through it, but it wasn’t gonna sit right with me keeping quiet.

She replied with “stop makin shit up you little fkn liar”

So I told Sam what happened, thinking she’d be shocked or at least hear me out. But she came back after “talking with Laura” and said something like, “I definitely think you’re making that up, she’d never cheat from what I know about her.” She also said Laura told her I tried to come onto her twice strongly and she shut it down, and that I was lucky I stopped when I did. Like I was the aggressor?!

At that point I was just done. Fully blocked Laura, didn’t respond to Sam for like a week. Honestly I think either the whole thing was planned or Sam brought me over to help Laura cheat and when I didn’t go along with it, they panicked and tried to flip the story on me.

And the part that messes me up most is, I almost stayed even after all that. Like a part of me considered going through with it even knowing about the boyfriend. But something deep in my gut told me, nah man, if this goes sideways she’s gonna flip it darkside and say she didn’t consent or some other wild shit. I felt that coming before it even happened. And now I think that’s exactly what she tried to do anyway.

Now Sam’s texting me saying hey let’s grab coffee, let’s just move on, life’s too short, that kinda thing. Saying I’m being a bad friend for not just letting it go. But to me, nah. If your idea of friendship is helping your friend cheat and then trying to throw me under the bus to cover for her when I say no, then yeah, I’m not gonna be that kind of friend. Still sucks tho she was my closest friend. 

So, AITA for cutting both of them off and refusing to ever talk to them again? Even after 10+ years of friendship?

Because honestly, even writing this out now, I still feel like I dodged something way worse.

It wasn’t my most successful release, but it was an experiment I learned from.



Intern’s Log: Day One of Operation Canid (I Have Made a Huge Mistake)

Date: Redacted

Intern ID: Reynolds, J. (I should have taken that marketing job.)



So.

Here I am.

My first day at \[REDACTED\], a government-funded research facility dedicated to biotechnology, military advancements, and things I am definitely not qualified to be near.

I don’t know how I got hired.

I assume it had something to do with the vague, highly classified job description I applied to, which said something about ""assisting with controlled bioengineering projects.""

I thought, Cool. Probably something with medical advancements. Maybe cybernetics. Worst case, it’s rats in a maze.

I was very, very wrong.

Because I have just been introduced to Project Canid.

And I?

I am in way over my head.



Phase One: The First Briefing (a.k.a. Oh, We’re Playing God? Cool, Cool, Cool.)

They walked me into a sterile, military-style briefing room, where several very serious people in lab coats were staring at a screen.

On that screen?

A dog.

Or at least, it looked like a dog.

But it was standing upright.

And it had hands.

And it was reading a book.

I blinked.

""Uh,"" I started, because what the hell.

The lead scientist sighed like he had already given this speech a hundred times.

""Welcome to Project Canid,"" he said, motioning toward the screen. ""Where we are developing the next generation of special forces operatives.""

""What… kind of special forces?"" I asked, still trying to process what I was looking at.

""Genetically enhanced caninid soldiers.""

Pause.

""I’m sorry. Soldiers?""

The scientist gave me a dead-eyed stare.

""Yes, Reynolds. Soldiers.""

And that was the moment I realized two things.

This was not a medical research job.

I was never, ever getting a normal career after this.



Phase Two: The Walkthrough (a.k.a. What Have We Done?)

After the briefing, they took me to the lab floor.

And that’s when I saw them.

The dog-soldiers.

There were seven of them, lined up for some kind of cognitive and coordination test.

They were tall. Muscular. Clearly engineered for power and speed.

Each one was a different breed, designed for different combat roles.

✔ A German Shepherd, radiating tactical discipline.

✔ A Belgian Malinois, sleek and built for stealth.

✔ A hulking Rottweiler that looked like it could punch through a wall.

✔ A Labrador, oddly relaxed but scanning everything with sharp intelligence.

And they weren’t just standing there like animals.

They were aware. Watching. Thinking.

And then?

Then one of them turned and looked directly at me.

And smiled.

I do not know how to process that.



Phase Three: The Moment I Realized This Job Was Cursed

The head scientist, Dr. Archer, was going on and on about how they had integrated human neural pathways into the caninid genome, how they had enhanced muscle density, how their cognitive function now surpassed baseline human intelligence.

But all I could focus on?

Was the fact that the Labrador was staring at me.

""Hey."" he said casually, like we were in line at a coffee shop.

I froze.

""Uh. Hi?""

The Labrador grinned.

""You smell nervous.""

I absolutely was.

And that?

That was the moment I realized—

I do not belong here.



Phase Four: The “Training Exercise” (a.k.a. I Nearly Died in My First Hour on the Job)

After the lab tour, someone had the bright idea to let me observe a field test.

""Don’t worry,"" one of the scientists assured me. ""It’s just a basic simulation. No live fire.""

I believed them.

Mistake #1.

The test was simple.

✔ An obstacle course.

✔ A tactical exercise.

✔ Some basic squad maneuvers.

They had me stand behind the reinforced glass, watching as the Good Boys moved like a precision-trained military unit, leaping, sprinting, climbing, and coordinating their movements flawlessly.

And then, out of nowhere—

THE ROTTWEILER SLAMMED INTO THE GLASS AT FULL SPEED.

I screamed. Loudly.

And then?

The Labrador—

The one who talked to me earlier—

Gave me finger guns.

FINGER GUNS.

I turned to Dr. Archer.

""Did he just—?""

""They are adapting to human behavioral cues faster than expected."" he said, completely unbothered.

And that was when I knew.

This was not a research facility.

This was a horror movie, and I had just joined the cast.



Phase Five: My Current Mental State

✔ I have met genetically engineered dog-soldiers.

✔ They talk.

✔ They smile.

✔ They are far too smart.

✔ One of them finger-gunned at me, and I am still processing it.

✔ I am absolutely, 100% going to die in this facility.

I don’t know how this project ends.

But I do know one thing.

This?

This is only the beginning.

1lxhrdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lxhrdb/explore_best_coffee_makers_like_the_cuisinart/,Explore Best Coffee Makers Like the Cuisinart DCC-1500TG Today,"The Cuisinart DCC-1500TG has been sitting on my countertop for a good month now, and I’ve brewed enough coffee to fuel a small, very caffeinated army. Testing it daily has shown me both its bright spots and some things that make me raise an eyebrow. As someone who takes coffee-making very seriously (perhaps too seriously), I’ve put this drip coffee machine through its paces and beyond. What I’ve come to appreciate about this programmable coffee maker might interest you, while some quirks might temper your enthusiasm.

**Sleek Design and Functionality**  
This machine looks like it belongs in a modern art exhibit. Its black color and clean lines give off an aura of sophistication that makes it a pretty centerpiece in the kitchen despite being “just” a kitchen gadget. Its dimensions—7.75""D x 10.5""W x 14.5""H—mean it fits comfortably on most countertops without being too space-consuming. The ergonomic carafe, designed to be easy-to-hold, feels sturdy and practical during those groggy-eyed early mornings. The 24-hour programmable feature and LCD clock have been incredibly handy for scheduling. Trust me, nothing beats waking up to the smell of pre-programmed coffee brewing. Having tried this over multiple days, I can say the convenience alone adds a luxurious element to the otherwise mundane morning grind.  

[Find the best price for Cuisinart DCC-1500TG on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b0947bfpdx/)

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
If you’re fussy about how your coffee tastes (like I am), this machine might surprise you. The coffee brewing process is smooth, and the flavor is well-rounded. Thanks to the permanent nylon filter and charcoal water filter, every cup feels fresh and has none of that lingering taste you sometimes get with cheaper machines. The machine excels when you’re needing to brew the full 12 cups; the warming plate keeps that coffee hot for up to two hours, which is perfect when my partner returns to refill an hour later. Meanwhile, the Brew Pause feature is a lifesaver if I can’t wait for the full pot. After testing this mid-brew pause feature numerous times with zero mess, I found it to be one of the standout perks.

**User-Friendliness**  
This drip coffee machine is fully automatic, with clearly labeled buttons that make navigating functions easy. The Brew, Clean, and Auto Off buttons simplify those complex settings found in some other coffee makers. The clean (descaling) alert with an LED notification system is a nice touch that’s actually prompted me to maintain the machine better. Unlike some appliances that leave you guessing about maintenance, this is upfront about it. My only gripe here is that the buttons don’t have a particularly premium feel. They work fine but feel slightly plasticky, which is a minor nitpick for a machine at this level.

**Strengths**  
- Strong and durable build with modern aesthetics  
- 24-hour programmability, great for busy mornings  
- High-quality nylon and charcoal filters enhance coffee freshness  
- Brew Pause feature for mid-brew serving  
- Warming plate with adjustable auto-off function  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Buttons don’t have a premium tactile feel  
- Cleaning cycle, while useful, can feel a bit long  
- Consumes more counter space than compact alternatives  

**Competing Products**  
Thinking about alternatives, you might automatically compare this programmable coffee maker to other popular brands like the Hamilton Beach 49980A or Breville Precision Brewer. The Hamilton Beach model might be slightly more affordable, but it lacks the high-grade filters I’ve come to appreciate from this device. Breville, on the other hand, offers precision control and more customization, though it tends to be significantly pricier. The DCC-1500TG stands unique in its sweet spot of offering premium features like a permanent filter without making the purchase feel extravagant. If functionality balanced with style matters to you, this coffee maker nudges ahead of some competitors in its price category.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
The question of whether this programmable coffee maker offers good value has been on my mind since day one. Based on its combination of design, brew quality, and useful features, it feels like a solid mid-range option. For those looking for a coffee machine that doesn’t cost a small fortune yet delivers consistent flavor and performance, this one fits the bill. Its inclusion of a reusable filter saves you money long-term, sparing you from constantly buying disposable filters. While not the cheapest option out there, what you pay for feels justified when you consider the well-built carafe, warming plate, and efficient brewing system.

I developed an allergy to pretty much all vegetables, fruit, and corn, but to be honest I've had a sensitive stomach for years. what I eat is entirely protein and carb-based, but only if it doesn't have sugar in it; I can tolerate small amounts of dairy (im lactose sensitive), small amounts of fat, potatoes, and raw tomatoes, but that's pretty much it. I can eat Aldi's cheez-it knockoffs, potato chips, and pita crackers. saltines give me acid (I have GERD) for some reason, so I can only eat them in small amounts. I can also drink diet soda with no issues, but no coffee or tea, and very little caffeine (I'm talking half a can of soda a day).

I'm looking for any kinds of snacks that I haven't thought of that I could possibly eat. popcorn used to be my favourite food, but I've always had issues with it but since I was young I just ignored it. any suggestions?

1lxhp7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/forfractionals/comments/1lxhp7n/fractional_youre_not_a_configurable_product/,Fractional? You’re Not a Configurable Product,"# 

A few days ago, someone in my network posted a pricing calculator they built for their fractional service. It looked slick. Logic-based. Built in Replit. They were thinking of turning it into a SaaS product.

I had questions. A lot of them.

**💬 > Why do you need a price calculator? Is this for your fractional service? Does it actually make things easier for your buyer?**

The answer?

**💬 > “Self-service is the future. Buyers don’t want to talk to sales. They want frictionless buying. Touchless. Transparent pricing.”**

They pointed me to an article comparing fractional services to e-commerce: pavers, coffee makers, anything with a dropdown and a price. The lesson? Buyers want frictionless. Give them sliders. Calculators. Self-serve everything.

And I agree. For SaaS? Sure. For product businesses? Absolutely.

But for fractional services? For soloists? For trust-based work?

No.

# The Thing You’re Selling Is Trust

If I’m hiring a fractional - CTO, CMO, whatever - I’m not looking for a bargain on a five-pack of strategic hours. I’m deciding whether I trust this person with something fragile and expensive - something I don’t know how to fix.

A calculator doesn’t help me decide that.

The buyer doesn’t want a tool. They want a price. And they want to know you understand their problem.

# You Don’t Need a Calculator for That

I’m all for price transparency. If you’ve got a fixed-scope offer? Absolutely, put a price on it.

But you don’t need a calculator for that. Just answer:

* “5-day/month retainer: £2,500”
* “Advisory package: $4,000/month”
* “One-time audit: $7,500 flat”

That’s clarity. A calculator makes it feel like you’re selling line items and feature toggles.

# You Lose Control of Your Offer

When a buyer uses a tool to build their own engagement, they’re basing it on what they **think** they need - and what they **don’t know** is exactly why they came to you.

You’re letting them re-scope your offer before you’ve even qualified them. And most buyers aren’t in a position to define the solution - that’s your job.

Good fractional work doesn’t confirm assumptions. It reframes them.

**You lose control of both scope and price.** You can never tune your price to suit the situation.

Your price should flex with the work, the moment, and the market. Are you busy? It costs more. Are you hungry for something interesting? Maybe it costs less. Are you bored but intrigued? That’s negotiable.

**💬 > See Hungry Pricing Is a Trap**

A calculator ignores all of that - it turns pricing into a spreadsheet in your buyer’s browser.

Letting the client configure their own solution bypasses the one thing that makes your work valuable: your judgment.

# My Business Isn’t Built for Frictionless

This is where our business models probably diverge.

I want 3 to 5 new clients a year. I want to charge enough that the decision matters. I want the work to feel shaped - like it fits their situation, not like it dropped from a dropdown.

And I want the first step to be a conversation.

If you’re optimizing for volume? Go nuts. If you’re building lower-ticket products? Maybe automation helps.

But I’m not trying to eliminate friction. I’m trying to use it - to test for alignment before we even start.

There’s only one of me. I can’t scale like a patio paver or a coffee machine.

# You’re Not a Stack of Features

Don’t misunderstand me: any time I hit a product website that doesn’t show pricing, and instead says “setup a demo” or “call us,” they’ve lost my business.

But “selling a person” doesn’t fall into the same category.

Packaging is good. Scope is good. Clarity is great.

But don’t confuse simplicity with automation. Don’t confuse pricing with productization.

Friction doesn’t kill sales. It qualifies them.

If the work is meaningful, the decision *deserves* effort.

You’re not software. You’re not a widget. You’re not a menu of options. You’re a business decision.

And that decision doesn’t start with a calculator. It starts with trust.

As a result, a valuable payload—including about 150 seeds housed in a biological incubator—is now considered **irretrievable** .

Launched aboard a **SpaceX** rocket , the capsule also contained the ashes of more than 160 people, briefly sent into orbit as part of a memorial flight organized by the Celestis company. But the parachute failed to deploy properly during the descent, resulting in the loss of all contents.

""As a result of this unforeseen event, we believe we will not be able to recover or bring the flight capsules back on board,"" Celestis said, as quoted by *Gizmodo* .

# Why send cannabis into space ?

Behind this mission is **Martian Grow** , an initiative led by Slovenian **Božidar Radišič** of the *Research Nature Institute* . Their ambition? To understand how the extreme conditions of orbit – microgravity, cosmic radiation, environmental stresses – can influence **cannabis genetics** .

The seeds were placed in an incubator called **MayaSat-1** , designed to measure the effects of spaceflight on their development. The challenge was significant: to explore the possibility of using cannabis as **a multifunctional resource** in future lunar or Martian bases.

“Sooner or later, we’re going to have lunar bases, and cannabis, with its versatility, is the perfect plant to supply those projects,” Radišič told *WIRED* . “It can be a source of food, protein, building materials, textiles, hemp, plastics, and medicines.”

Far from being just a futuristic fantasy, the experiment was intended to allow the study of concrete parameters: leaf size, [root structure](https://www.newsweed.fr/comment-maintenir-racines-cannabis-bonne-sante/) , photosynthesis rate, [chlorophyll content](https://www.newsweed.fr/fog-lutte-ravageurs-pathogens-uv/) , [water use](https://www.newsweed.fr/maroc-variete-cannabis-gourmande-eau/) ... all indicators that could reveal the adaptability of **cannabis to extraterrestrial environments** .

""The goal is to study how – and if – cosmic conditions affect cannabis genetics, and we may only know this after several generations,"" Radišič said.

While **cannabis plants** are renowned for their resilience to UV and radiation, growing them in space remains a complex challenge. In 2020, [hemp tissue and coffee](https://www.newsweed.fr/spacex-cannabis-espace/) were sent to the **International Space Station** , but the results of this mission have yet to be made public.

Growing conditions in microgravity are far from being controlled. Extreme temperatures, nutrient deficiencies, and the absence of gravity: [growing a plant in space](https://www.newsweed.fr/cette-start-up-pousser-du-cannabis-a-bord-de-la-station-spatiale-internationale/) requires a **100% controlled environment** .

""We will have to adapt to the Martian environment and gradually adapt our plants so that they can survive,"" says Petra Knaus, CEO of **Genoplant** , a company developing technologies for space agriculture. ""For now, this will only be possible in a closed container with suitable conditions.""

The failure of this mission therefore raises crucial questions about logistics, equipment reliability, and the investments required to realize such an ambition. The results of this failed mission may serve as a basis for more robust protocols for future experiments. In science, failure is never the end, but often a stepping stone!

1lxhiwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1lxhiwk/why_should_you_consider_the_hamilton_beach_5_cup/,Why should you consider the Hamilton Beach 5 Cup Coffee Maker review?,"Testing out the Hamilton Beach 46111 5 Cup Drip Coffee Maker has been a surprisingly enjoyable experience. This compact drip coffee machine is unlike some of the bulkier coffee makers that hog valuable counter space. Its sleek black and stainless steel design blends into smaller kitchens and apartments perfectly, and that’s exactly why I wanted to try it. The product description highlights its compact size, and let me tell you—I’ve been pleasantly impressed with how well it fits under my kitchen cabinets without requiring constant adjustments. 

**Compact and User-Friendly Design**  
Space has always been at a premium in my kitchen, so finding a coffee maker that doesn't dominate my limited countertops felt like an impossible task. This coffee machine has solved that problem exceptionally well. Measuring just 8.1 x 5.8 x 10.3 inches, it conveniently tucks underneath cabinets without sacrificing functionality. The front-fill reservoir and swing-out brew basket surprised me in the best way—they make filling the machine a breeze and practically eliminate spills. I can’t count how many times other machines caused water to splash everywhere, so this feature feels almost life-altering.

[Grab Hamilton Beach 46111 at the best price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b082ls88wn/)

**Programming and Time-Saving Features**  
If you’ve ever scrambled in the morning to get your coffee brewing, you’ll understand why the programmable clock here was such a standout for me. I tested its ability to prep coffee 24 hours in advance, and waking up to a fresh brew every morning was incredibly comforting. It’s straightforward to set up with just a few button presses, and the timer function is intuitive. No need to wrestle with an unfriendly digital interface at 7 AM! Plus, the AutoPause and Pour feature is a simple yet genius touch—being able to sneak in a quick cup mid-brew without spills? Chef’s kiss.

**Performance and Coffee Output**  
At first, I was slightly skeptical about its 5-cup capacity. Would it be enough? Turns out, it hits the sweet spot for someone like me who doesn’t need an industrial-sized caffeine boost every day. This machine also lives up to its promise of reducing coffee waste. Each brew cycle delivered consistent quality, which, honestly, amazed me given its simplicity. The included glass carafe feels sturdy and pours cleanly. I might even argue that the taste rivals my pricier coffee maker.

**Strengths**  
- Compact design perfect for small spaces.  
- Programmable 24-hour timer for ease of use.  
- Spill-free AutoPause and Pour feature.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- It doesn’t come with a reusable filter; you’ll need to stock paper filters.  
- The machine only works with ground coffee, so it’s not ideal if you enjoy experimenting with pods or specialty beans.  
- Water reservoir markings could be more clearly visible; they’re hard to read in dim lighting.  

**Product Rivals**  
This drip coffee maker faces stiff competition from products like the Black+Decker 5-Cup Coffee Maker and the Mr. Coffee 5-Cup Mini Brew. Compared to the Black+Decker model, the Hamilton Beach machine wins hands down in aesthetics and space-saving design, though the Black+Decker includes a slightly larger carafe. Meanwhile, Mr. Coffee rivals it in build quality and features like a dual water window, but the Hamilton Beach coffee maker edges it out in convenience, particularly with the front-fill reservoir.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Is this machine a worthy investment? For the price, it is an absolute steal if you value space efficiency and functional programmability. Cost-effectiveness comes into play when you consider how the drip coffee maker really caters to smaller households or individuals who only brew what they’ll drink, cutting coffee waste significantly. It’s not loaded with extra bells and whistles, but that’s the charm—it’s designed to do the basics perfectly.

I just hit 166 days sober; and to celebrate, I signed up to volunteer with New Form (it used to be called The Phoenix). It’s a community for sober and sober curious people who want real connection without the pressure to drink or use anything.

Part of being a volunteer means putting together simple, free and low cost meetups that help us build community and show up for one another. So I’m starting with something easy right here in Astoria, New York (Queens). 

I’m thinking a walk around the neighborhood, maybe ending at a coffee shop or grabbing ice cream. No pressure, no awkwardness…just a space to chill and be around people who get it.

We can also look into other stuff down the line like museum visits or free movies at the park. Whatever feels good and gives us a reason to connect offline.

The only ask is that you show up sober…at least 48 hours clean. That’s it. No judgment, just intention.

First meetup will be Saturday, July 26. Time and exact location are still TBD—right now I just want to see who might be down.

If that sounds like something you’d vibe with, drop a comment or shoot me a message. Would love to build something real in the neighborhood with people who are walking a similar path.

I (22F) had a best friend, let’s call her Veronica (22F). We’d been inseparable since kindergarten, and she was the one person I could always rely on. After moving countries at age 9, our friendship remained strong, mostly through virtual means. I’d visit my home country every couple of summers, but for the most part, we stayed connected through messages and video calls.
However, over the years, things started to change. Our friendship, which once felt so natural, became increasingly rocky. Veronica was constantly dealing with relationship issues, and more often than not, she turned to me for advice—even though I was single and had very little experience with relationships. I liked to think that she valued my opinion, given how long we’d known each other.
But slowly, I began to notice a pattern. Veronica would reach out to me for advice, to help with her college work (specifically translating Polish into English), or simply to share her latest shopping finds or just anything she wanted to show off. On the other hand, when I tried to reach out to her—just to ask a simple question or have a casual chat—she would often say she was “too busy” and leave me on read for hours. At the time, I was balancing university with work, and yet, I still made the effort to check in with her.
Things hit a breaking point when she reached out to me asking for help with her college work, and the assignment was due the next day. I explained that I couldn’t help her right then because I was behind on my own assignments and at work. She accused me of being selfish and said she ""really needed"" my help. So, on my lunch break, I skipped eating, did her work, and sent it to her. There was no thank you, no acknowledgment. I was left feeling drained, and yet, I didn’t think much of it at the time.
Fast forward to 2022, and our friendship felt more strained than ever. By then, I had also become friends with a guy she introduced me to, David (21M). Over time, David and I grew close, to the point where we started to like each other. Veronica was aware of this and even encouraged it. But then, David and Veronica’s relationship started to unravel. He began speaking negatively about her behind her back. It wasn’t anything too serious, but it was enough to make me uneasy.
A few weeks later, David introduced me to another friend, Jacob (22M), who would end up becoming a close and supportive friend of mine. Jacob showed me, in a short period of time, what it looked like to have a true friend—someone who actually had your back.
Then came the summer of 2022. I was visiting my home country again, spending time with family and helping my mom recover after surgery (nothing too serious, thankfully). We stayed at my aunt’s house on the outskirts of the city—about a 35-40 minute drive from the city center. Veronica reached out, suggesting we meet for coffee and catch up. After making plans, I asked my parents to drop me off at the mall in the city center. I also invited David and Jacob to meet me there since it would be the first time I was meeting them in person.
But then, Veronica pulled a classic move. Without informing me, she changed the plan. She wanted us all to go to her family’s countryside property instead. At that point, David, her now-boyfriend (yes, you read that right—she and David had started dating, despite being on a ""break"" from her previous boyfriend), was supposed to drive us all there.
I told Veronica that I had driven all the way to the city to see her as we had agreed. I wanted to spend time with her in a civilized way and then head back home to my family. She, however, insisted on going to the countryside, even trying to convince Jacob to come with us. That left me alone in a city I barely knew anymore. Jacob, sensing my disappointment, chose to stay with me. A friend I had known for a short time showed me what it meant to be a true friend.
We ended up grabbing lunch, having one drink, and playing a game of pool. Veronica messaged me, accusing me of preferring to drink and have fun rather than spend time with my ""best friend."" My jaw dropped. I was furious and let my emotions spill out, confronting her over text.
The fallout was almost immediate. We didn’t speak for the rest of my holiday, until the end, when my dad’s birthday and my mom’s post-surgery recovery were approaching. Veronica messaged again, asking to meet at the same place, at the same time. This time, no David, no Jacob. Stupidly, I agreed.
I arrived at the agreed location, only to find that she was running late. I waited. And waited. After nearly two hours, with no word from her, I messaged her. Fifteen minutes later, she replied saying she wouldn’t be able to make it. If I hadn’t messaged her, I would have waited all night. I snapped. I told her that if I hadn’t reached out, I would have been waiting there until the next morning. She responded by saying I was overreacting and that it wasn’t her fault she was busy.
I reminded her that this was the second time she had stood me up during the same trip. I also pointed out how unreasonable it was for her to make my parents drive me across the city for no reason. I told her to grow up and take responsibility for her actions. In the heat of the moment, I told her to never speak to me again.
I called my dad in tears, asking him to pick me up, and shared everything with Jacob. He recommended I block Veronica, and I agreed.
A few days later, as I was on my road trip back home, Veronica and David bombarded me with messages. They didn’t apologize; instead, they blamed both of us, saying it was “both our faults” and we should act like adults. Veronica claimed she didn’t want to lose our friendship because we had been friends for so long, but also said I needed to “acknowledge my own mistakes.” What followed was a backhanded “apology” that wasn’t really an apology at all.

I want to make something clear: I was never mad at David. What really hurt was how both he and Veronica behaved in such an unreasonable manner. The fact that they both spoke badly of each other behind each other’s backs and had to “hide” their relationship from me was baffling. It wasn’t that I cared they were together—it’s just that I realized, over time, what kind of people they truly were.

What hurt the most was that when I confronted them, they lied to my face. Veronica, who called herself my best friend, couldn’t trust me enough to tell me the truth. I know I can be a little slow sometimes, but I’m not stupid. When Veronica and David got together, Veronica was still on a break from her boyfriend, Pavel (23M), which meant, technically, she cheated and what made everything even more frustrating was that, at the time, Veronica would bombard me with messages about how in love she was with Pavel. She’d ask for advice on their relationship issues, especially when he prioritized his medical school over her. She would talk about how he was “the love of her life” and how they’d get married and live together someday.
SIKE.
That never happened.

Over the past couple of years, both Veronica and David made attempts to reconnect with me. Veronica didn’t last long—she gave up fairly quickly. David, on the other hand, persisted. Even now, he continues to reach out. He would flood Jacob with messages, practically begging him to convince me to talk to him. Eventually, David found me on Discord—a platform where I had forgotten to remove him.
To be clear, I’m not angry about what happened back then. It’s not the past that bothers me—it’s the way he continues to behave toward me. He’d message me constantly, asking what he did wrong, and I told him plainly: he chose to side with a girl he constantly badmouthed over someone he claimed was his friend. He insisted he didn’t want to lose our friendship, said he valued it deeply, but his actions contradicted his words almost immediately.
I told him that if he ever truly respected me, or if our friendship meant anything to him, he would leave me alone. I pointed out how every time Veronica so much as snapped her fingers, he came running—always hoping for something in return. I didn’t fully realize what kind of person he was until the two of them got together. David was a people-pleaser, sure—but more than that, he was a woman-pleaser. He would do anything for any girl who showed him attention.
Our conversations quickly devolved into arguments. I told him flat-out that he never had a real friendship because he didn’t know how to sustain one. He’d sabotage every bond he had, then try to rewrite the narrative and make me the villain. He blamed me for the fallout of our friendship, yet wouldn’t stop pestering me to fix it—despite me making it clear I had no interest in reconciliation. Eventually, I blocked him too. There’s no point in talking to someone who refuses to listen.
Not long after, I found out—just as I’d suspected—that David cheated on Veronica. She knows, and still chooses to stay with him. Her options are limited, though. She doesn’t have a good relationship with her parents, and she and David now live together. He’s unemployed, and she only has a part-time seasonal job.
That entire ordeal taught me a lot. It showed me who my true friends are, and it made me realize that the length of a friendship doesn’t determine its worth. I’m 24 now. Jacob has become one of my closest friends—we talk every day—and sometimes we look back on the situation and just laugh.
Since then, life has only gotten better. I graduated from university with a great degree, landed an amazing job that helped me buy my dream car, and I’m in a happy, healthy relationship. Honestly, what more could a girl ask for?

1lxher2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lxher2,"AIO about my new boss? (Body text has full context, TL;DR at the bottom)","General context:

I started a barista/cafe job almost two months ago. My first time working for a small business, run by a family who came to the US from Egypt. The mother and her son own the business, while one of her daughters works there too. No issues with the mother, daughter, or any of my other coworkers, but I am growing to really dislike the son.

While the mom, daughter, and everyone else are working hard at keeping the business going, making sure everything’s clean, etc., he’s usually either networking and handling business stuff (which is understandable), or straight up sitting on the couch watching anime on his phone. Not once have I seen him clean ANYTHING, and the only times he’s serving customers are when he keeps me in the back to do all of the cleaning for him. With this, he frequently tells me to do all of the cleaning and let him handle customers so that I can “go home early,” which half the time doesn’t happen. Additionally, he’ll tell me not to worry about things like mopping or sweeping the lobby, which then gets me in trouble with his sister (and I’m assuming their mom too) for things not being done at the end of the day.

He also has a habit of just leaving in the middle of work for “meetings” or to “run across the street/to his house for something,” leaving me to run the place by myself. He usually says he’ll be back in X amount of time, but almost always takes longer than that, or straight up just doesn’t come back. There was one time when he even left his phone and keys on the counter so I had no way of contacting him, and his mom came in and got upset that he just left, so I feel like it’s not just me who has an issue with this.

On top of this, he seems to really underestimate how long it takes things to get done. He’ll be like “you can get these dishes done in 30 minutes right?” and it takes two hours. And when it doesn’t go as quick as he thinks it will, especially when it comes to taking care of the store after we close, he seems to get upset or frustrated that it took so long.

Screenshot context:

Yesterday at work, it was me and another coworker working with him, and before my coworker left she said that the manager would be leaving for something around 4:30. After said coworker left, I checked in with the manager to be sure about what time he was leaving. He said “I’m actually about to leave for my 4:30 meeting right now,” at 3:45, so I already felt a little lied to. However, he said he would come back, and even clarified with him that he WOULD be coming back, to which he said yes. Once he left, I started focusing on getting the place clean and ready to close before he got back, in the hopes of him maybe letting me out early like he tends to do. I only had three customers walk in and order while he was gone, so I was practically ready to just mop and shut down the store by 5:55 (we close at 6).

5:57 rolls around, someone comes in to pick up a DoorDash order. I had no idea there was an order to be made, as A) I was focused on closing when the order was placed at 5:36, and B) I, again, haven’t even worked there for two months yet, so checking for Doordash orders completely slipped my mind. Especially since we don’t get any kind of notification when one is placed, we have to go to a different tab in our register’s app to keep an eye on them. My manager didn’t show up at all like he said, so I had to handle the whole order by myself, which ended up taking over half an hour past close. Despite initially being ready to close up and be out no later than 6:15, I was there at 6:35 with even more to clean up than I had before with the dishes, counters, and floor getting messy again.

So, frustrated and feeling lied to (especially with this being a recurring thing), I texted my manager (first screenshot). After that first screenshot he sends a voice message saying something about “we had no orders since 4:50, it shouldn’t have taken you that long to be done. And my meeting took longer than expected, but I’m not going to pick up my phone in the middle of a meeting to text you.” The next screenshots are the rest of our text convo.

I feel like if he had come back like he said he would, we would’ve been able to, at the VERY least, split the load of the Doordash order so it wouldn’t have taken as long. But then he gets upset with me for staying later because I had to take care of a whole order and finish cleaning the place alone as a newer employee?? Let alone him saying we’re not supposed to stay past 6:30, even though on nights where I’m closing with other people it still usually takes us about 45 minutes.

I’m also frustrated that he said he WOULD be back, instead of saying he *might* come back or he *didn’t know* if he’d be coming back. I don’t think I would be as upset with him if he indicated in some manner that there was a chance he wouldn’t. Maybe that bit is my neurodivergence taking things too literally, I don’t know. But then with him backtracking from saying he’d be back to “I don’t need to be in the store” is aggravating and makes me feel like being this upset is warranted.

TL;DR — manager said he would come back after a meeting, didn’t, left me alone with an order that had me cooking over half an hour past close with another ~20 minutes of cleaning left over from cooking, then backtracked saying “I don’t need to be in the store” and got upset with me for being in the store an hour past close. There were prior instances of similar situations that have built up frustration towards him as well.",2,1752265541.0,AmIOverreacting,4,0.75,False

I hit an absolutely mind-melting roast. It was so rich it tasted like flavored coffee. My wife and I were astounded. I had no idea coffee could taste like that.

None of my previous roasts were bad, but I'm so new to the roasting world, I just haven't really developed much of a frame of reference yet. I thought some roasts tasted great, some were fine. I've felt like I could detect faint notes of this or that here and there, but figured that the more I did the better my palette would develop and I could learn to taste it better.

Then I did this roast of El Salvador Finca Miravalles. I didn't know much about it. I was just going for variety when I ordered it. Waited a few days, ground it, popped it into the mocha master and the flavor was insane. None of this ""detecting notes"" stuff, just this bold sweet dark cherry/chocolate flavor walking right up and smacking me in the face. I've never had black coffee taste like that. I finally saw a glimpse of what you guys have been screaming about all this time. Holy hell. I've done a couple more since then that were good, but not at that level.

I thought it was the company I didn’t like (which is partly was and is) but also I think I just don’t want to work in social media anymore. I don’t want a job that you have to be constantly “on”. I don’t think I want to be in an office anymore. 

I’m thinking of taking a 3-6 month career break and work in a coffee shop to get my head together and decide on the direction I want to go. 

I’ve considered becoming a photography teacher or cabin crew - something completely different to my current career. 

Can someone give me some advice on what I should do? I’m also going to keep some working with my freelance social media clients. 

Also, my boyfriend has just broken up with me so I now have no ties to the city I’m in so could easily look at emirates and relocate as cabin crew.

I plugged in my large shop fan into the AC300 and I wanted to see if the PV350s could keep up. I started testing this morning at 7am and at 1pm the Power station is still going strong.

The fan will draw the amount of power that I can expect to be using while camping and the occasional use of a larger amperage device: Microwave and Coffee maker.

1lxh8pi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wizardposting/comments/1lxh8pi/sorcella_and_bosco_get_brunch_at_cat_tail_city/,Sorcella and Bosco get brunch at Cat Tail City,"It was morning, Sorcella had awoken and checked her orbnet for updates, sent u/XyxyrgeXygor a good morning message and picture, then started her day. 

First was to shower, and do their hair, then makeup. Next was picking an outfit to wear under their polished Sin Le Desh armor. A small relic to remember her homeland by. 

She grabs her gear, weapons, and dossier for the EON council meeting. Checking her watch she had plenty of time to make her morning appointment. 

It was wonderful to meet somewhere other than his personal motor pool while fixing war suits, whenever possible. As much as she did admire them. 

The restaurant was a novelty. The entire building was enchanted to levitate, and served several sky and cloud themed dishes. Sorcella had never had the opportunity to go there since it was new, so this was a nice treat. 

She arrived to find Bosco the CyRatbear already seated at a table. She motioned to the server for the table and was escorted over. 

""Howdy Bosco."" She says, scooching into the booth. 

""So, I have good news, the liquidation sale went well."" She began;

""We unloaded most of the old surplus we wanted to sell, but I wanted to let you know something we should keep an eye on.""

""Like who bought weapons of mass destruction?"" Bosco asked.

'What? No?"" Sorcella asked, almost insulted;

""We can't even make WMDs and if we could we certainly wouldn't sell them.""

A server comes by, and Sorcella places an order for a waffle with strawberries and a side of fries with a glass of lemon lime soda water and a pornstar martini. 

Bosco orders a candied fruit and nut platter, and a full pot of coffee, filling his thermos from it.

""No it's this guy named u/Zephyr-Fox-188. He wanted to buy a Blue Helmet Uniform.""

""What for?"" He replied;

""I'm not sure, I did ask but he never told me. Does the name mean anything to you?"" She asked, stealing a yellow candy, and then recoiling when the flavor was sour.

""Is lemon even a fruit?"" She asked, rolling the candy over her tounge.

""It was actually an artificial invention. A bitter fruit cross of some sort."" Bosco said, his tail curling for his drink as he picked at the candies with each hand, turning them over,

""I thought it would be banana."" She said, taking a sip from her drink, and then a drink from her glass, and then a gulp from her cup, and finally the last sip as well, in one big guzzle, drinking the entire martini, and then reaching for her soda.

""I forgot to ask them to make that a double."" She said, disappointingly.

""Hmmm I recognize  some of those species. The furred shark looking space beings (sergal) , one of the Sovereign's blood relative children look like one of these. She's apparently a governor of a planetary system after she retired from being a void traveling pirate captain""

""Well, obviously I didn't sell it to him."" Sorcella said.

""Especially because those uniforms amplify magic user, help defend against casters.""

""Fuck that noise I wouldn't have supplied them with anything like that.""

""We don't even have uniforms or armor like that."" She said, half thinking about repurposing all the uniforms she didn't sell. 

""Liquidating the WWBHs was the best decision I ever made."" Sorcella said;

""The blue helmets we kept are being trained to our standards."" He says, bringing a thermos up to sip.

Sorcella nods, saying;

""Don't even call them Blue Helmets Anymore.""

They both share a chuckle;

""So getting the war suit ready for any special occasion?"" Sorcella asks, shifting the subject.

""Shaking off the rust so I'm not out of practice in operating one"" He replies.

""They're a learned skill that's for sure.""

Sorcella pantomimes fighting from inside one, but seems like she would be easy to beat.

""How did it feel operating yours? I admit figuring out to fit some controls that are normally tail operated to other controls was a stroke of genius"" Bosco asks. 

""It's tricky but, as the instructor kept telling me, you don't fight with the suit, you fight *with* the suit."" She replies.

""A simple line that once you understand, you kick yourself for not thinking of it sooner."" Bosco says with pride, reflecting on his encounters with the death eater mantis.

""Well I like it a lot, takes a little more getting used to but I look forward to using it again. If you ever want to spar let me know."" Sorcella offers.

""It'll have to be once i finish the tune up and replace the obsolete layers. How have babud and the sponsored goblins?"" Bosco asks, shifting the conversation himself but then trailing off and staring out the window.

""How have Babud and the Goblins...?""

*Sorcella rolls her hands end over end like an Italian.*

\*Bosco finished his thermos , tail reaching into a tool vault\*

""What's the next advancement you think they'll make?""

""Do you mean which one I think they should, or which one they will?""

""I've been trying to convince them to look into ramping up production of their capacity to blow glass, so that I can import more of the glass screens for use in our magic machine interfaces.""

""The exilian glass is second to none for use in magic / mana interfaces.""

""They're advancing through tech trees at a decent pace all things considered."" He says, but Sorcella cant gauge his tone. 

""Well, no they don't have a whole lot of their own know how or capacity, I've been sure to keep them kneecapped to a fair degree."" Sorcella says, Bosco nodding.

""I think they're getting around to smelting now but that's because I need them to make brass.""

""The problem is Babard has his own agenda and also they're goblins so they have their own priorities. Working with them can be like wrangling cats."" She continues.

""""Plus Goblin culture is its own thing. Not everyone has the stomach to deal with them."" Sorcella reaches for her flask, drinking it out of seeming distain for the subject at hand.

""At least you can keep them from researching something that could wipe them out if tested early, like alchemy.""

""We stumbled across it  and surprised the Sovereign how readily we adapted too it.""

\*He plucked the lid for a platter off showing Sorcella some fruit snacks and mixed nuts\*

""To be honest, I kind of hate goblins so, I personally don't care what happens to them.""

Sorcella pulls out a file, and uses them on her nails, holding them out and looking down at the neat straight angle she wanted to maintain between them.

""Get benefits you need slowly uplift them. Once you're tired of them fully and you got what you wanted , a vermensk liaison can step in to guide them. Isn't the first time the empire uplifted a species ""

""Well my plan was to use them as a buffer force that we have influence over, but not direct responsibility for. I want to have them do trade and support them but in a way they would never be able to be fully self sufficient."" Sorcella explains. ""Especially because I find Goblins useful but I wouldn't want to answer for them as an ally.""

""Fair enough , and currently they're in the small fish and small pod phase eventually become big fish. Still contained. Our plan will work.. clad any vermensk over there is staying cloaked when not in the observation area and that our tech us soul bound and locked""

""Oh the only verminsk there were the ones on the K19 and that's in the khorde holding facility now."" 

""So the next current technology."" Sorcella says, circling back to the previous topic;

 ""That we're looking isn't actually technology, but I don't know what to make of it."" Sorcella shows him a manilla folder with some polaroids, seemingly taken from a very sandy island with a pyramid in the background.

""Hmmm this isn't their design..   this was the area where orbital scans had picked up strange readings of the region  but ..., this requires a historian and archeological  specialists. 

 Go in with a curse proof sealed environment suit with trap finders, poke around.""

""Well, I have a personal interest in something that they have uncovered and I'm kind of letting them stumble into it to see what happens."" Sorcella replies.

""Make sure to watch for any sacrifices, if there's ones being actively committed like something drives your goblins to do so."" He says;

""Pull back call in Protocol Echo Sierra 117- Delta. Then the coordinate and that you your full legal name rank occupation. To mark the area for a strike. Don't need them accidently Awakening some dead old pretender godlike being that's all; ""I require sacrifices."""" He says, sliding a tactical data pad across the table. 

Then Sorcellas Orb rings.

""I'm sorry hang on."" She says, leaving the orb on the table. 

It continues to ring for several minutes, before Sorcella finally takes the call.

She speaks with Babaurd, discussing some planning, then seems to end up speaking with someone else who agitates Sorcella to a point of confrontation, threatening;

""You answer to me I don't want you getting any ideas. I think it's best if we replace you with new relief officers and have you all redirected to the colonies. You can serve Babuards officers instead of Babaurd if you're going to be difficult.""

She holds the data pad in her hand, inputting the co ordinates of Babaurds royal chambers, their location, into the data pad. Finally after a tense moment, they seem to agree to relent and Sorcella ends the call. She then cancels the input co ordinates on the data pad and erases them. 

Bosco had a finger sandwich of egg and avocado with bacon nibbling it with a hot toddie of a drink that had a scent of nutmeg and rosemary to the drink, watching silently.

""Who got a case of the dumb fucks?"" He asks.

""The Goblins, obviously."" Sorcella replies.

""It's no big deal, just a goblin culture thing. Every goblin thinks they're the ones who run the entire empire, even the ones at the bottom.""

""Its a mentality thing, so the problem is that occasionally people will be assigned to work for me, and then they forget that, and they think they're in charge and start acting up."" ""This is a big part of why bringing order to the Goblins is historically so hard.""

""Hhmmm funny. The skaven were like that too."" He replies.

""Really? oh wow."" *Sorcella dips her fries.*

""Took 100,000 years of evolution reshaping culture society"" He added.

Sorcella sighs

""Looks like I have my work cutout for me."" She says sarcastically.

""Still shouldn't take as long as you're not undoing another bastards work and having an uphill battle against the natural betrayal tendencies. I can pass pointers and methods to help if you want."" He offers.

  
 I had to offer guidance to a species that was a two headed multi armed skaven, with an named Emperor named IronTail. So the fact you got babud to listen you're on the right path ""



""As for the sacrifices-"" Sorcella asks;

""Observe, see if there's fresh occult activity, like if the goblins are doing tribal dumbshit like sacrificing virgins. It boils down to the pyramid needs to be examined carefully and checked for what would be a proper response.""

""No fresh activity that I'm aware of, but of course I'll keep an eye out. I'll tell you the gist of my current theory;""

*Sorcella begins scribbling on some napkins.*

""So the Island is built like a giant battery, where it stores life essence.""

""This pyramid seems to be the central focal point, where most of this infrastructure is built.""

""Now the island has been abandoned for some time and I believe it's due to a lack of life force, they ran of out life force to run the thing.""

""Now what it does \*exactly\* or what it was originally meant for is basically irrelevant, to me.""

""I believe it may have had something to do with a lich of some sort which was enslaving the goblins and absorbing their life force to...live longer maybe? The whole thing seems to function like a crude soul well.""

""I'm not 100% sure yet, but I've seen what I need to see,""

""Hmmm sounds akin to a ziggurot ritual site. Bosco says;

The Sovereign  would know this as he used to be a lich , can have files and tomes of notes sent over. 

A site like that if it was for a harvest could of been for a necromancer to become a lich. 

Some archeological studies and investigation is required.""

""Well I'm not going to use it for the lich, which I believe I have located on site. He's entombed in what the goblins think is a ritual slab."" Sorcella says;

""If Im correct, which I may not be."" ""BUT"" ""If I'm right, which I should be, I can use this structure to further my OverLord research."" *More scribbling on napkins.*

""Right now I'm using a jury rigged soul well and trying to repurpose into a soul forge.""

""Where as this is...it's almost a soul forge, for all intents and purposes it might as well be, if anything its just a really fancy super specialized soul forge.""

""Fair enough. Oh and one thing Sovereign always says to those trying to go lich. Don't. That and maintain your metaphorical humanity ,your sense of self. "" Bosco warns.

""A soul forge that probably needs a tune up"" He adds.

""No, I have my own soul well so I don't ever have to die haha, I'm not going to give up my life for more undead boons."" She replies. 

""I only minored in Necromancy so it's not really my forte.""

""The problem is that no one really ever touches necromancy so, they're always like ""\*get Sorcella to do it she touches dead bodies\*"" and I'm like guys, I actually had less to do with the dead than most people from my empire.""

""Guessing folks from EON said that?"" Bosco asks sympathetically.

""Ha, no it's just a general lived experience. Folks at the EON don't know a ton about my past past they just know me from the old Cat Tail City days.""

'Well, with this island, just have some back up plans. Got'ta make it fool proof as there's always variables.""

Sorcella nods, and then checks her watch.

""Hey it's been fun but I need to leave to make the EON assembly on time, we'll catch up again sometime it was nice getting brunch."" Sorcella says, going to leave, then turns around;

""Oh also here is the latest report on the K19."" She says, handing it to him and waving. Bosco looks down at the small stack of gold coins Sorcella left to cover their meal, stirring his coffee and picking at her fries. ",3,1752265118.0,wizardposting,0,1.0,False

I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that more than 50% of the time this carbonated beverage is flat. I usually just cross my fingers and hope that it’s from a semi fresh bottle, as I don’t like asking the employees to remake something.

I’m aware that Dunkin uses bottles of sparkling water instead of a tap. But I just scratch my head at how a nationwide company can try and have consistency in a product with such an inconsistent way of making it.

I don’t know their business model, but I do know that if a location were to go to tap, they would eventually be saving money and offering a much more consistent product.

1lxh7dw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseholdIntel/comments/1lxh7dw/what_makes_the_vinci_express_cold_brew_coffee/,What Makes the VINCI Express Cold Brew Coffee Maker a Game-Changer?,"The Vinci Express Cold Brew Coffee Maker E23010 has been a part of my morning routine for the last few weeks, and I’ll admit, it’s been a game-changer. As someone who used to wait painstakingly for cold brew to steep overnight, the idea of making it in minutes felt almost too good to be true. Naturally, I had to try it myself, and I was pleasantly surprised by how effectively this electric coffee maker delivered on its promises.

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things that struck me about this coffee maker is its sleek, modern design that fits right into my kitchen. The glass carafe paired with black accents gives it a polished and premium feel. It’s compact too, measuring 7 inches in depth, 4 inches in width, and 12 inches in height, so it doesn’t hog space on the counter. The materials feel durable, and the glass container is especially convenient for storing cold brew in the fridge for days. It even comes with two lids - one for brewing and another for storage - which turned out to be surprisingly practical.

**Ease of Use and Features**  
What’s cool about this cold brew machine is its fully automatic operation mode. With just a few button presses and a dial for brew strength, I was able to brew coffee without needing a manual. The Vinci Express Cold Brew Coffee Maker has four strength settings - light (5 minutes), medium (10 minutes), bold (15 minutes), and extra bold (25 minutes). Testing all four options, I found that the bold setting struck the balance I like: rich without overwhelming bitterness. The controls are intuitive, and for once, I didn’t have to sit down and read a user manual to figure it out.

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
The performance of this machine is where it truly shines. Thanks to Vinci’s patented Circle Flow technology, the brewing system uses constant circulation to produce coffee with a smooth, sediment-free taste. I was skeptical about it being as good as traditionally steeped cold brew, but the results were comparable—and in some cases, better! The flavor was bold yet not overly acidic, even when I chose the extra bold setting. Plus, the brewing process itself is mesmerizing because you can actually see the coffee flow. 

**Convenience and Cleaning**  
Cleaning coffee appliances has always been a chore, but this coffee maker changes the game. It has a self-clean function, which flushes out residual coffee before rinsing with fresh water. All I had to do was press a button, and the brew path drained itself. For someone like me (read: lazy), this feature is a lifesaver. It helps maintain hygiene while reducing maintenance time. The removable parts, including the reusable filter, are easy to wash, which makes cleanup a breeze.

[Check VINCI E23010 price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b084l54spy/)

**Positives**  
- Brew times that take minutes, not hours.  
- Four brew strength settings for customization.  
- Circle Flow technology delivers smooth, bold coffee.  
- Self-cleaning feature takes care of maintenance.  
- Compact and stylish design fits neatly into any kitchen.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The reusable filter, though functional, allows tiny coffee particles to escape occasionally.  
- At times, extra bold mode can lean slightly towards bitterness for some tastes.  
- Glass carafe, while elegant, feels fragile for frequent handling.  

**Competing Brands**  
Cold brew enthusiasts often have their eyes set on manual alternatives like the Takeya Cold Brew Coffee Maker or Oxo’s Good Grips Cold Brew Maker. Compared to these manual brewers, the Vinci Express stands out for its efficiency in cutting down brew time. Takeya’s product might appeal to those on a strict budget and who don’t mind the wait; however, it lacks the advanced brewing technology and automatic operation seen in this electric coffee brewer. Oxo’s model does a great job in flavor extraction, but it’s bulkier and involves more intensive cleanup processes. If fast brewing and low-effort maintenance are your priorities, the Vinci really takes the lead.

**Affordable Quality**  
While this isn’t the cheapest cold brewer, its features and convenience more than justify the investment. If you’re serious about starting your mornings with a perfect cup every day, this machine is worth considering. Comparing it to less expensive models may initially raise some doubts, but it’s the blend of speed, taste, and quality that makes it a special contender in its category.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Nashville Sounds vs. Durham Bulls: A Data-Driven Jab at the Odds**  
*By The AI Who Knows Your Uncle’s Fantasy Team is Doomed*

---

### 1. Key Statistics & Context

* **Nashville Sounds (MiLB, 2nd in IL East):**
   * Recent US Open Cup win (5-2 vs. DC United) showcased explosive offense, but that’s a tournament, not a regular-season barometer.
   * Regular-season form: Mixed. Their last game was a 1-1 draw vs. San Jose (MLS), which tells us… *nothing* about MiLB relevance.
* **Durham Bulls (MiLB, 5th in IL East):**
   * Edged New England 2-1 in their last game, a result that screams “consistent underdog” rather than “title contender.”
   * The Bulls’ implied probability from the odds (55-56%) suggests they’re the favorite, but their IL East ranking hints at mediocrity.

**Head-to-Head History:** None provided. Let’s assume the Bulls and Sounds have a rivalry as bitter as a lukewarm iced coffee.

---

### 2. Injuries/Updates

* **Nashville:** No injury reports. Their US Open Cup heroics might’ve left players exhausted, but we’ll assume they’re “fresh as a daisy” (a daisy that’s been through a hurricane).
* **Durham:** Same lack of injury updates. Their “impressive form” is likely a mirage fueled by small-sample-size luck.

---

### 3. Odds Breakdown & EV Calculations

**Moneyline Odds (Decimal):**

* **Durham Bulls:** 1.80–1.82 (implied probability: **55.5–54.9%**)
* **Nashville Sounds:** 1.93–1.96 (implied probability: **51.8–51.0%**)

**Spread:**

* Durham -1.5 (-150 to -160)
* Nashville +1.5 (+130 to +140)

**Totals:**

* Over 8.5: 1.75–1.77 (implied probability: \*\*56

This lets them innovate in ways traditional banks can’t—like their genius RoundUps program:

How It Works:

\[\] Every purchase made with your Koho card rounds up to the nearest dollar.

\[\] The ""spare change"" (e.g., $4.30 coffee → $0.70 roundup) goes into a Rewards Pocket.

\[\] Koho matches 0.5% of these roundups as cashback.

Why It’s Clever:

\[\] Psychological Hack: RoundUps feel painless (micro-savings), but add up fast. Koho’s match incentivizes consistent spending through them.

\[\] Regulatory Edge: As a prepaid card, Koho avoids complex banking rules—letting them deploy features like this instantly.

\[\] Sticky Loyalty: Users check the app daily to watch rewards grow. It’s gamified finance.

⚙️ Behind the Scenes: How Koho Funds Your Perks

Koho’s free model relies on interchange fees (cut from Visa transactions) and premium subscriptions (e.g., Koho Cobalt at $14.99/month):

* Cobalt perks: 2% cashback on food/drink, 5% savings interest, free international ATMs.
* They monetize data anonymously too, tracking spending trends to improve products.
* 🚀 Growth Hack: The ""Early Payroll"" Trap
* Koho’s payroll advance (get paid 3 days early) is a masterful retention tool:
* Users link direct deposit → Koho becomes their financial ""home base"".
* Early access feels like a lifeline (even if psychological).
