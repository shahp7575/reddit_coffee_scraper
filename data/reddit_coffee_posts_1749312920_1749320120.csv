Hi friends!

Coming to you because I am still trying to settle on my MBTI type. I had been identifying as an INFP for a long time, but recently it was suggested to me that I am INFJ instead, and a pretty compelling case was made to me that my functions seem more like introverted intuition plus extroverted feeling than introverted feeling plus extroverted intuition. I was wondering if I could please describe these to you and get some feedback on if this does fit the INFJ pattern. I am admittedly much less studied on INFJ than INFP. I am eager to figure this out, not just because I am interested in personality and naval gazing in general, but also because I am starting a new work duty soon and would like to use my type to approach and improve my strengths and weaknesses.

Here are my thoughts today: 
- woke up late, which was nice because it is a Saturday. I felt happy to be well rested but also realized that sleeping in later is probably making me more allergic because my cat likes to sleep next to my face. I feel less allergic on most weekdays and it occurred to me that this is probably because I spend less time in the bed. I am not really planning to change anything based on this new understanding. I could use eyedrops, but I don‚Äôt like the feeling, and I could lock my cat out of my room, but I like my cat too much. I am drinking caffeinated coffee now, which always helps my allergy symptoms as well as my executive functioning.
- my sibling texted me asking what I am doing. I suspect they would like me to come over but they don‚Äôt tend to give me much heads up. This is consistently frustrating. I don‚Äôt know if it is that I am more introverted or J, but I like to arrange things in advance. I do want to spend time with my sibling. I will try to catch them later, after I finish my big task for the day. I believe sibling is ESTP.
- Husband asked me why I look stressed. I explained to him that I currently have too much to do at work and not enough time to do it in. This is not usually the case, but there have been several changes to the organization recently, and there is much less supervision, communication, and follow-through than there previously was. Thankfully, I am about to move locations, but I need to get through this period first. I explained to husband that I am planning to get some work done today, which is sort of annoying to spend my time on the weekend doing, but it will make me much more relaxed through the week. 
- I am about to start on the work now, but am slightly procrastinating by writing this. Lol. In my head, I was going to start the work around 10 or 11. I think some part of me that is not very realistic. But I feel sort of lazy. I do not really know what this is about me, whether this is MTI perceiving or if this is neurospicy or if this is just a normal human person not feeling like doing extra work during their free time. I mean, I will be still getting it done early. But I‚Äôm also late on my own timeframe. I don‚Äôt know if this is more P or J.

Some other considerations:
- I typed myself previously as INFP because I do have strong emotional responses, I have strong values, and I don‚Äôt always feel very good at social situations. I also am messy and sometimes late, both which I really dislike. I did type myself before getting diagnosed with neurodivergence, and I don‚Äôt really know to what extent MBTI and relate. Like, I would assume that perceiving types are more likely to have my variety of ND (inattentive) and vice versa. 
- I am meticulously organized at work, and poorly organized at home. I really need external structure to thrive. I can set up and somewhat maintain a structure myself, but it demands a huge energy load from me. It also takes a long time for me and I am not very good at it. I am, however, decent at creating external structures for other people. I am decent at enforcing them, too, though it is not my preference.
- Emotionally, I feel like my emotions mainly revolve around social situations and whether I am feeling like I am living up to the expectations of those I love and/or admire or not. I am also strongly impacted by the fairness of a situation or not, both for myself and others.
- I am an Enneagram 9w1 social/self-pres in case that happens to be useful in consideration. I realize they are two separate systems, but I figure there is probably some level of correlation. I promise I am not one of the crazy PDB people. ü§≠

*""Did you want a coffee?""* ‚Äî at first glance, this question looks odd.  
The person is asking now, but the verb is in the past tense. Why?

In English, this form of polite question is very common, especially in places like caf√©s, restaurants, and casual conversations.  
But why does using a past tense sound polite?  
And why do so many explanations about this seem unsatisfying?

In this post, I will examine the logic behind this phenomenon and show why the past tense works as an effective politeness strategy.

*Note: For those interested in a more detailed, linguistically focused version of this topic (including cross-linguistic comparisons), a companion post will be available soon.*

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Usual Explanations ‚Äî And Their Problems

English learners are often told that the past tense here ""**creates psychological distance**,"" making the request sound softer.  
Or they hear that ""**the past tense here doesn't mean past time**"" ‚Äî it's just a politeness marker.

But these explanations have serious flaws:

* They suggest that ""**time and politeness**"" are completely unrelated, which is misleading.
* They often fail to explain why ""**could**"" and ""**would**"" actually feel more polite than ""**can**"" and ""**will**"".
* They don't account for why ""**Did you want...?**"" is preferred in certain contexts but sounds strange in others.

Clearly, there's more going on.

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ A Better Explanation: Temporal Framing and Cognitive Pacing

Here's a more useful way to understand this phenomenon.

When we use *Did you want...?* or *Would you...?*, we are not simply being indirect.  
We are subtly shaping the **temporal frame** of the interaction.

By putting the question in the past tense, the speaker does two things:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Signals that the request is **not sudden** ‚Äî it may have been thought about or assumed earlier.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Gives the listener **time to consider their response** ‚Äî they don't feel immediate pressure.

This is related to **cognitive pacing**:  
A well-paced question gives the other person **mental space** to reflect, which increases comfort and politeness.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Real-life Examples

Compare:

* *Will you have a coffee?* ‚Üí sounds like a request **right now**, can feel pushy.
* *Would you like a coffee?* ‚Üí softer, gives more time to think.
* *Did you want a coffee?* ‚Üí adds another layer ‚Äî suggests that perhaps the listener had already been considering this, reducing pressure even further.

In real conversations, this subtle shift makes a big difference.  
It also allows for **easy rejection** without awkwardness:

*""No, I didn't.""* ‚Üí socially smooth.  
*""No, I don't.""* ‚Üí feels more abrupt.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-cultural Perspective

Other languages handle this politeness-time relationship differently.

* Korean and Japanese often use **sentence pacing and phrase delaying** rather than tense shifts.
* Spanish and Italian sometimes use **conditional forms**.
* In English, **past tense framing** is a highly effective and well-accepted strategy.

This shows that **politeness and time framing are deeply connected**, but each language implements this differently.

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Common Misunderstandings to Avoid

* ""**The past tense here has nothing to do with time**"" ‚Üí False. It does ‚Äî it frames the **social time** of the request.
* ""**It's just psychological distance**"" ‚Üí Too vague. The more precise effect is about **temporal pacing and response management**.
* ""**You must always use it**"" ‚Üí No. Context matters. In formal situations, *Would you...?* is often better. With friends, *Do you want...?* may be perfectly fine.

# 7Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion

When used well, *Did you want...?* is not an odd grammatical error ‚Äî it's a **powerful tool** for managing politeness and social flow.

It works because it:

* Frames the request in a **non-immediate temporal space**.
* Gives the listener **processing time**.
* Provides an **easy out** if they wish to decline.

In other words:  
It uses **temporal framing** to create **social comfort** ‚Äî which is one of the core functions of politeness itself.



*Note: I am not a linguist nor an expert in English education. The following analysis reflects an independent reasoning process based on publicly observable usage and cognitive principles. Given that similar ideas may have been explored elsewhere, this post does not claim originality but aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion in a transparent manner. Constructive critique and discussion are welcome.*

1l5qz74,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l5qz74,3 weeks in Vietnam (March 2025),"Some things I learned in Vietnam:

\- There is so much to do in Vietnam that we really have to go back someday to do the rest (and experience Ha Giang again)

\- Coffee: Nowhere in Asia as good as here! And especially very tasty local varieties

\- traffic rules do not exist, zebra crossings are suggestions, traffic lights are better suggestions (they only apply to straight ahead, but they remain suggestions) and the road signs are just confusing. The only rule here is the law of the horn.

\- if the Dutch are born on a bicycle, the Vietnamese are born on a scooter. The rest of the family is already on one of those.

\- Banh Mi: thanks to the French for introducing the baguette here. And especially thanks to the Vietnamese who gave it such a delicious (and cheap) twist. Vietnam is the first Asian country where we had a delicious local lunch (with bread) every day

\- Everyone is polite and wants to provide you with the highest quality service, but hardly anyone speaks English

\- If you are easily overstimulated, it is best to avoid the streets, because the constant wailing of the horn will quickly knock you down

\- Do you want to buy tickets somewhere? Then choose your desired option at the ticket counter and then be told to which other counter you will be taken by bus so that you can buy it there, after which you will be brought back and the tour can begin.

\- so much is arranged so randomly and you will often wonder what is going on and why no one explains it to you, but everything always works out fine. It all - somehow - really works in Vietnam.

\- Ha Giang is in our top 5 coolest things ever experienced. The feeling on the back of a motorbike in this area is really indescribable. I recommend Tiem Tours if you are looking for a company.

\- If you want to see animals on your trip; don't go to Vietnam. There are barely any (wild) animals.

\- Banh Xeo and Banh Mi are the best.

\- The weather in Vietnam fluctuates so much that you have to be lucky no matter what season you go.

anyway, how are you? my only wish for him is that his dream to work abroad gets granted, since he‚Äôs already in the process of leaving the country. Good luck and it was really nice meeting you, G!

* I am so financially stable at 29 (at the time I was 22 when I wished this). I have saved up a ton of money, but my main reason for that? Dating a manipulative older man 16.5 years older than me. I wanted to be free, and I am no longer with him. 
* Before I left my ex, I actually kept seeing myself in a white apartment with my exact type of dog. It happened a couple years later. I also saw that I would get coffee with another ex, and that happened too. 
* I saw my cute lil' mini cooper in my head. I got her back when I was 26. She's used but perfect. Nothing crazy about this story.
* I got a nose job, I did not manifest this one well. I wasn't specific and while my nose isn't botched and slightly improved, it looks nothing like I asked. But I do think this was for me to seek out specialists and not general plastic surgeons, even if they are highly rated. It's all about stepping stones sometimes!! 
* I was lying in the tub, and felt really in sync with the universe. I longed for a tattooed bf who lives abroad, and to be seen on a screen.  (something like that). I also specifically thought for whatever reason, that my lover doesn't need to be rich. I want to meet someone I fall hard for even if they are financially not well. **And so,** randomly, my favorite Youtuber followed me back (what?!) we met, and started dating. He's tattooed. He isn't from my country. And I am on his Youtube channel / was on many live streams. But, he's not making as much money as he used to. He used to make TONS on Youtube. He makes a decent amount streaming but he also has to pay bills. And having a cushion didn't matter. Basically he wasn't carrying his weight, I didn't mind lower income, but if it's from being lazy and you're not equally contributing, I can't do it. This is an ongoing breakup. We care deeply for each other, but it's difficult seeing it work because if we stayed together I'd have to live abroad at his parents house, with no car or friends. I shot myself in the foot with this one. I care about him deeply, and it sucks. It's too surreal. I also remember watching him on youtube 8 years ago and thinking 'we'd be really good friends'.
* I have always seen myself traveling. Specifically solo traveling. My ex and I went out of the country together. We broke up mid trip. I am currently writing this on my solo travel :) It is MUCH needed. 
* I also recently had many issues with my parents. I tried to redirect my thoughts to 'we get along and have a great relationship' and I was scared they would helicopter parent me when I told them I was solo traveling. They have shocked me with how supportive they've been recently. 

I think that's all I can think of for now. I have a current vision in my head. Multiple things I see clearly. I don't want to type it out, but I know that's already me. I feel it in my fucking bones. I don't know what this magic is, but trust the process. Be specific. Sometimes you don't know how it's going to happen, but the universe WILL make that shit happen. This is your life, make it what you want it to be. 

Positive thoughts. It's okay to fall back sometimes. Progress isn't linear. But holy shit, so many things have happened. You just have to BELIEVE it. Like actually know it's happening. 

  
Vent over, tldr. Manifestation is real and I see visual images of that reality sometimes. Like a foreshadowing or whatever. ",1,1749318658.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

Let‚Äôs dive into the magic of monsoon travel in India, perfect for those searching for ""best places to visit in India during monsoon.""

# Why Monsoon is the Perfect Time to Explore India

The monsoon season in India is a celebration of renewal, where parched lands bloom into vibrant ecosystems, and the air carries the earthy scent of petrichor. It‚Äôs a time when tourist crowds thin out, offering a peaceful escape, and travel costs drop, making it budget-friendly. The rains amplify the beauty of India‚Äôs landscapes, from the misty Western Ghats to the rain-soaked Northeast, while cultural festivals like Teej in Rajasthan add a festive charm. Whether you‚Äôre a nature lover, a culture enthusiast, or simply seeking serenity, the monsoon unveils India‚Äôs raw, unfiltered beauty, making it a top choice for ""monsoon travel in India.""

# Kerala: The Land of Rain-Kissed Backwaters

Kerala, often called ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Own Country,‚Äù becomes a monsoon paradise with its backwaters, hills, and spice plantations glistening under gentle showers. The rains enhance the state‚Äôs emerald-green landscapes, making it a haven for nature lovers. Munnar, a hill station in the Western Ghats, is a must-visit, with its rolling tea estates, misty peaks, and cascading waterfalls like Attukal. For a romantic drive, take the Kochi to Munnar route, a scenic stretch winding through lush forests and cardamom plantations, though be cautious of slippery roads. Pack waterproof clothing, use insect repellent to ward off mosquitoes, and avoid street food to stay healthy. Foreign tourists need a valid passport (minimum six months validity), an Indian visa (e-Visa available for many nationalities), and travel insurance. Savor Kerala‚Äôs monsoon cuisine like appam with stew, a soft rice pancake paired with a warm coconut-based curry, or the spicy fish curry that warms you up on a rainy day.

# Meghalaya: The Abode of Clouds

Meghalaya, aptly nicknamed the ‚ÄúAbode of Clouds,‚Äù is a monsoon dreamscape in Northeast India, where the rains create some of the world‚Äôs most dramatic natural wonders. Known as one of the wettest regions on Earth, Meghalaya‚Äôs landscapes burst with life, from roaring waterfalls to misty valleys. Cherrapunji and Mawsynram are top destinations, offering sights like the Nohkalikai Falls and living root bridges, which look ethereal in the rain. For a breathtaking drive, the Shillong to Cherrapunji road is a treat, with panoramic views of rolling hills and deep gorges, but watch for foggy patches and potential landslides. Carry a raincoat, non-slip shoes, and monitor weather updates for heavy rainfall alerts. Foreign visitors should bring a passport, Indian visa, and travel insurance. Warm up with Meghalaya‚Äôs Khasi dish, Jadoh‚Äîa flavorful mix of rice and meat‚Äîor try tung tap, a tangy fermented fish chutney that pairs perfectly with the rainy ambiance.

# Rajasthan: A Desert Romance in the Rain

Rajasthan, typically known for its arid deserts, transforms into a romantic haven during the monsoon, as the rains bring a refreshing contrast to its golden sands. The season softens the harsh climate, making it ideal for exploring the state‚Äôs palaces and lakes. Udaipur, the ‚ÄúCity of Lakes,‚Äù is a highlight, where the monsoon fills Lake Pichola to the brim, perfect for a boat ride with views of the rain-washed City Palace. For a scenic drive, the Jaipur to Udaipur route via NH48 offers glimpses of the Aravalli hills, their slopes turning green in the rain‚Äîensure your vehicle is equipped for wet conditions. Pack an umbrella, stay hydrated, and avoid flood-prone areas. Foreign tourists need a passport, Indian visa, travel insurance, and an international driving permit if driving. Indulge in Rajasthan‚Äôs monsoon favorites like Dal Baati Churma, a hearty lentil-and-dough dish with a sweet wheat crumble, or ghevar, a festive sweet that‚Äôs a rainy-season treat.

# Himachal Pradesh: Monsoon in the Himalayas

Himachal Pradesh, nestled in the Himalayas, offers a magical monsoon experience with its mist-covered mountains and pine-scented air. The rains amplify the state‚Äôs natural beauty, creating a serene escape for travelers. Manali, with its apple orchards, roaring Beas River, and nearby Rohtang Pass, becomes a monsoon wonderland, though the pass may close due to heavy rain, so check conditions. The Shimla to Manali drive via NH3 is a romantic journey through winding mountain roads, with views of cedar forests and misty valleys‚Äîjust be cautious of landslides and drive slowly. Pack warm clothing, waterproof boots, and keep emergency contacts handy for weather updates. Foreign travelers require a passport, Indian visa, travel insurance, and an international driving permit for driving. Relish Himachali cuisine like chha gosht, a tangy lamb curry, or sip on a hot cup of thukpa, a noodle soup that warms you up amidst the chilly rain.

# Karnataka: Coffee Trails and Waterfalls

Karnataka, in South India, comes alive during the monsoon, with its coffee plantations, hill stations, and waterfalls taking on a mystical charm. The rains rejuvenate the Western Ghats, making it a haven for nature enthusiasts. Coorg, often called the ‚ÄúScotland of India,‚Äù is a top spot, with its misty coffee estates and the stunning Abbey Falls, which roars with monsoon waters. The Bangalore to Coorg drive via NH275 is a scenic delight, winding through lush greenery and small villages, but watch for potholes and slippery patches. Pack quick-dry clothing, use insect repellent, and avoid trekking in heavy rain. Foreign tourists should carry a passport, Indian visa, travel insurance, and an international driving permit if driving. Savor Karnataka‚Äôs monsoon cuisine like Pandi Curry, a spicy pork dish from Coorg, or bisi bele bath, a comforting lentil-and-rice dish that‚Äôs perfect for a rainy day.

# Essential Monsoon Travel Tips

Traveling in India during the monsoon requires careful preparation to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip. Health-wise, use insect repellent, drink bottled water, and avoid street food to prevent illness. Pack waterproof gear, an umbrella, and non-slip shoes for slippery terrains, and keep a raincoat handy for sudden showers. Stay updated on weather forecasts, especially in areas prone to flooding or landslides, and adjust your plans accordingly. Travel insurance covering weather disruptions and medical emergencies is a must for peace of mind. For foreign tourists, ensure you have all necessary documents: a passport valid for at least six months, an Indian visa (e-Visa or otherwise), travel insurance, and an [international driving permit India](http://Best Places to Travel in India During the Rainy Season) if you plan to drive.

So this isn‚Äôt a *usual* problem between my twin and me, though we argue about 57% of the time. I (18F) have been with my boyfriend (19M) since I was in 8th grade and he was in 10th‚Äîhe‚Äôs homeschooled and skipped a grade, so we‚Äôre only a year apart. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone about our relationship when it started, especially not my twin. I know, twins are ""supposed"" to tell each other everything, but I kept quiet because he matched everything she likes: white, green-eyed, curly blonde hair, freckles, 5'6"", homeschooled. I didn‚Äôt want drama or pressure.

My brother had guessed he‚Äôd be my BF way before anything started, so I thought it was obvious. Still, I kept it quiet until 11th grade. When I finally told her, she was *livid*. Looking back, I get why‚Äîit was wrong to assume she'd just figure it out. But honestly, I‚Äôve never had any real personal space from her. I‚Äôve only ever been without her for 3 minutes‚Äîliterally before she was born.

A few months ago, my boyfriend and I had a deep convo about relationships and marriage. We‚Äôre both religious and love philosophical discussions. He brought up the idea of marriage after high school. I told him we should grow individually before making that leap, but if we ever *did*, it should be with intention and space to develop separately too. He totally agreed.

In senior year (2024), I talked to my parents about proposing to him. They were supportive and said to talk to his parents‚Äîwho also said yes. So I bought a \$5,000 ring. I didn‚Äôt propose in front of family; we‚Äôre planning a second proposal moment for them later so they still feel included.

When I told my twin I was planning to propose, she flipped‚Äîsaid I was insane and threatened to *steal the ring* to stop it. When I asked why, she said it was ‚Äúthe right thing to do.‚Äù That‚Äôs when I found her notebook by accident, and yeah‚Ä¶ I opened it. It had pages about how she wanted to ruin my relationship and steal him. She called me slurs and said horrible things.

I know I shouldn‚Äôt have read it, but it felt too weird not to. I even changed my phone password so she can‚Äôt get into it. I love my sister‚Äîwe‚Äôve been best friends since before birth‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt let her destroy my future over jealousy. I *do* want to talk to her. I might invite her to coffee, see what‚Äôs going on, maybe even ask her to be my maid of honor if she‚Äôs willing to be respectful.

But‚Ä¶ I also plan to send her a fake invite to the engagement party just in case, because I *need* to protect that moment. If she shows up and tries to sabotage it, I‚Äôll uninvite her. So Reddit‚Ä¶ WIBTBF?",0,1749318494.0,AmItheButtface,12,0.5,False

I hope you‚Äôre having a cozy, calm, or at least slightly sweet kind of day. I‚Äôm reaching out with an open heart, looking for a cuddle buddy (female) and maybe a new friend here in the Netherlands ‚Äî ideally near Amsterdam, but anywhere not too far works too!

I‚Äôm not looking for any sexual activity and I stick to what we agree. 

A little about me:

‚Ä¢ I'm 35 years old guy working as an executive and happily calling Amsterdam home for over 3 years now.
‚Ä¢ I live alone, take care of myself, and try to stay fit ‚Äî but also never say no to dessert.
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôd be happy to host or come to you ‚Äî whatever makes you feel safe and comfortable.
‚Ä¢ I love being outside, especially in the summer ‚Äî picnics, strolls, a lazy lunch on a sunny terrace‚Ä¶ simple things, really.
‚Ä¢Traveling is a big part of my life and dreams ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to see the whole world, one new place (and snack) at a time.
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm a good listener ‚Äî friends often say I make them feel calm and heard. You‚Äôll get lots of warm, respectful hugs and cozy company if that‚Äôs what you need ü§ó
‚Ä¢ Cleanliness and kindness go hand in hand for me ‚Äî I value both deeply.
‚Ä¢ I'm 183 cm tall, 80 kg, have broad shoulders, little muscular, tanned skin, black hair, brown eyes.

What I‚Äôm looking for:

Someone to share gentle, genuine connection with ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs cuddling up on the couch, sharing a quiet moment over coffee, or just chatting about our days.

I‚Äôm also open to making new friends ‚Äî movie nights, cooking together, mini-adventures nearby‚Ä¶ whatever brings joy without pressure.

And of course, if you‚Äôd prefer to meet in a public space first, that‚Äôs absolutely fine ‚Äî your comfort always comes first.

So if you‚Äôre someone who values kindness, closeness, and maybe the occasional silly laugh ‚Äî I‚Äôd really love to hear from you. üíõ

* [https://cristobal-vildosola.github.io/DarkestHamlet/](https://cristobal-vildosola.github.io/DarkestHamlet/)

The Darkest Hero comes with all the unreleased heroes that were recently translated by someone else¬†[here](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3496903/addingmaking-leper-maa-and-flagellant). You can use it to play the¬†**Antiquarian, Flagellant, Leper, Houndmaster, Man at Arms, and Shieldbreaker**! You can also make parties with more than one of each hero (you can now play with 4 Crusaders for optimal darkest dungeon experience).

The app tracks everything related to a hero:

* Hero and Level
* Trinkets, levels and trinket state
* Wounds, stress and XP
* Abilities, levels and blacksmithed abilities
* Disease, affliction, and quirks
* Conditions with automatic wounds for bligth and bleed and a stunned indicator

You can track any number of heroes in case you play multiple games in parallel or play in smaller groups where someone controls 2+ heroes. You can also export your save so that you don't accidentally lose your progress. (\* the Abomination, Bounty Hunter and Grave Robber are in french because I couldn't find the assets in english.)

The Darkest Hamlet is a lot simpler and tracks your building levels, gold and provisions (we like to play the hamlet phase before saving so we need to remember how many extra provisions we bought).

Both of these apps support bookmarking to your home screen so you can save them as if they were apps in your phone/tablet (looks a lot better in tablet than phone but it's still usable).

I hope they make the game a better experience for you all. Enjoy the new heroes!

The scarves I ordered from the Ramadan collection (mink gray + empress teal) and ube latte from the spring collection have an odd stiffness to them. They softened with steaming, but out of the package they almost felt paper stiff. They are slightly more opaque because of this, but I prefer the buttery softness of other scarves I have like sadaqah blue and optic white from the restock late last year.

I'm pretty content with my current collection alhamdullilah, and I don't think I'll be buying more this year. I'm just curious because the softness will affect whether I might buy shades I'm borderline on.

Lots of folks either agreed or said that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs previews! What do you expect?!‚Äù and the past two days were worse than the previews lol. We feel bad for the team members having to deal with the fallout. 

We also don‚Äôt bother with Battle at the Ministry since we didn‚Äôt like it (common feeling even among team members). Might try it again once waits are around 30-45 minutes. 

Keep in mind, some rides will be delayed but it will not show on the app until they announce an extended delay! This may take upwards of 45 minutes before they announce an extended delay. 

TLDR Version: Beautiful park, good food, cute merchandise, but they will need years and a few more attractions to balance out the park. Yes, I‚Äôm aware of the ‚ÄúPhase 2‚Äù possibly planned in the future. 

We stayed at Dockside. Originally, we were going to be at Terra Luna. We have stayed at both Stella Nova and Terra Luna earlier. We didn‚Äôt really care for either of them. The transportation from Dockside was actually about the same time that it would take to get to 
Terra Luna-at least compared to two weeks ago when even bus transport said that they were having issues with that resort. We saved almost $500 just by choosing Dockside. For the my Starbucks lovers, Dockside has a full Starbucks whereas Terra Luna and Stella Nova have cafes that ‚Äúproudly brew Starbucks coffee‚Äù.

We would stay at Helios if they offered Express as we normally choose Royal Pacific or Portifino when we visit. The current costs do not justify their price for us. 

Thursday: 

-Arrived at 10:30AM to Epic. We just left Disney and Animal Kingdom lodge the night before and were at Magic Kingdom until almost midnight so we didn‚Äôt bother with early entry. Got through security within 2 minutes. 

-We went straight towards MoM for the show. Got in within five minutes. Preshow was quite long and standing room. If you have a kid, stand towards the front for the preshow if you can. We couldn‚Äôt really see anything from the back. Don‚Äôt worry about rushing to be the first in the theater, we tend to hang in the back and we got great seats. The show started and within two minutes they had technical issues and gave us Express Passes. 

-Walked over to Stardust Racers, but it was delayed. 

-Rode Monsters Unleashed. Great ride. Queue goes fast. Curse of the Werewolf was delayed. 

-Went to Oak & Star Tavern. Beautiful on the inside and good food! 

-Planned on going to Nintendo, but the portal was evacuated due to a fire alarm. 

-Walked over to Berk to go the that show. Waited 40 minutes in the heat and they then told us they were having technical issues and that the show was delayed. 

*This is the point where we were getting frustrated. 

-Went on Hiccups Winged Gliders. Great coaster! Waited 60 minutes. 

At this point, we‚Äôve been bouncing around a bit. So we went to MoM to split a crepe. We wanted to try the berry one. I have an allergy and they were great at accommodating! 

-Tried Nintendo again, but both Mario Kart and Donkey Kong were delayed. 

We got frustrated and went to Guest Services. It was past 5PM and only went on two rides. I couldn‚Äôt imagine how horrible that would be for a family who are lower income and could only do one day in the park. Guest Services had a long line and were texting people return times since the queue was so long. We stayed inside and were able to be seen in 30 minutes, but the people before us were there for almost two hours. The team member who helped us was super kind! We went in saying the positives first. The team member helping the family next to us (who went in pissed!) told them ‚Äúwhat do you expect! It‚Äôs a theme park!‚Äù and gave them one express pass. The team member helping us was understanding, agreed with our concerns, and gave us five express passes each.

*Note: these paper express passes cannot be used on Mine Kart Madness or BatM. 

-Decided to save the passes for the next day and decided to try Curse of the Werewolf since we had yet to go on it and it was a 35 minute wait. Got towards the front and the ride went down LOL.

-Saw the show at Ministry. It‚Äôs cute. Some good effects, there was some missed potential in the show, but I used to work at Disney so my expectations may be different. 

-By this point, it was later in the night and we decided to try Mine Kart again. Waited over an hour and we kept getting the ‚Äúthis ride may be delayed due to weather‚Äù on the intercom message. By two hours in the queue with little movement since they then stopped the ride, we decided to exit the queue. People were laying on the floor and there wasn‚Äôt a clear way to exit and no team members. Once we got to the front again, most of the way was closed and the team members were being rude to us(?) even though we were asking for help. They had five cast members just standing at the entry while families were trying to find a way to exit. 

Thursday left us pissed more than anything. 

Friday-

Arrived at 9:30ishAM. We are in no rush to be the first in the parks. Mario Kart opened at 10AM, so we headed over there. By the time the scanned our hotel room for early entry (9:45AM), they allowed non-guests to enter early. People were running in the portal.

-In Nintendo, people naturally formed a line for Mine Kart. Ride still wasn‚Äôt open at 10:15AM. Team Members then shouted ‚ÄúThere is no single file line! Just fill in all available space!‚Äù‚Ä¶of course loads of folks just ran up towards the front to only be funneled back into a single file line. Waited for Mine Kart to come back up for over an hour. My mom was getting a headache so she left. My dad and I waited about another 30 before we left. Once we pretty much left the line, the ride was working (lol). 

-Decided to get food at this point. Went to Goblet Noir. This is hidden towards the back and the workers were having to announce that they are an open restaurant. For being lunchtime, only a handful of people were in there due to location. Food was okay. 

-Went on Hiccups again with our passes. Then saw the show. We never seen How to Train Your Dragon, but cool effects and great for kids or fans of the movie. 

-Went on Curse of the Werewolf. 2/10 ride. It‚Äôs very much a kiddie coaster and was about thirty seconds in length. Felt like a carnival ride. 

-Left for a break for two hours at the resort since it was hot and we had express passes. This may have been our mistake since we when we returned any outdoor ride (which is all but three-ish) were on a weather delay. This lasted a bit of time. 

-Went back to Berk for dinner. Had the quick service. I didn‚Äôt see that Spitfire offered shrimp on their app (that‚Äôs on me) and ordered the salmon bowl. I‚Äôm allergic to shellfish and there was the skin of the shrimp that made it into my bowl. Noticed it before I ate anything. Manager told me that they use the same grill for shellfish and salmon! Most dining places will try to use separate grills to avoid cross contamination as standard practice since shellfish is a common allergen, but again-that was my fault for not seeing the shrimp on the app. Tables in that area are a mess and plastic ware is in the middle and the table has cups that hold the forks and whatnot built into the table. Felt dirty and people were grabbing things around in there. Not sure why they didn‚Äôt use the plastic ware dispenser used elsewhere. 

-By this point, it was 6:00PM and we still had our express passes (4 out of the 6) to use. Went to Mario Kart waited 45 minutes with the passes. Got all the way into the preshow room and the ride went down (lol!). At 7PM, we decided to leave and asked the team member to help us exit and asked if we can get our express back to use on something else. He was super accommodating but had to hide the fact that us and a couple were getting our passes back to avoid chaos and walked us privately back to the front and gave us the passes out of the sight of other guests. 

-Used our passes on Monsters. This ride was down for an hour or two in the morning, but they get the line through quickly. 

-Used the next express passes on the Carousel, holy cow it takes forever to load this queue and ride. Very cute‚Ä¶.but it‚Äôs a slow carousel lol. 

-Went on Stardust Racers. Express Pass lane was running super slow with the face recognition so some express folks switched to standard when they got close to the lockers. Went on twice since the park was about the close and to use up the express passes. Great coaster but not the smoothest at some points. 
When exiting, a team member was wishing everyone a safe trip home and that he hopes to see everyone again. A lady then shouted ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt see us back at this park again!‚Äù and large number of folks laughed and agreed. 

Remaining thoughts:

-Style>Substance. Influencer park since it‚Äôs great to photograph. Lots of visual details. 

-Right now, this park is a game of chance. There are people whose timing is better than ours and probably had a better experience. However, parks shouldn‚Äôt be a game of chance when families are spending so much money. 

-Hot park! Yes, we know it‚Äôs Florida but people may benefit from more shade and indoor attractions.

-Two or three indoor attractions would help keep people in the park since rain delays shut down a good portion of the park. It‚Äôs Central Florida and rains all the time, they should have planned for that.

-Team Members (but not Mine Kart) are great. They are dealing with this insanity and are understanding of everyone‚Äôs complaints and agree. 

-Park should have had another month of practice runs. Park is all about being technologically advanced, but they need rides that are safe options. Somehow the carousel goes down a lot too with a few of the seats not working even when it‚Äôs up. 

-Has potential to be great in a few years‚Ä¶not now. We wish we used our passes to go to IOA one day instead of Epic for two days. 

Edit to add: We know of all the tricks and tips! I watch All Ears and have been on the group pages. We made decisions that worked for us. Many tips work great for those who want the Bootcamp experience, but if you have younger kids, older parents, or other circumstances like most guests, you‚Äôre unable to follow a ‚Äúgame plan‚Äù. I am also a believer that theme parks should be enjoyable and not dependent on having a minute by minute game plan and months of planning. ",2,1749318153.0,UniversalOrlando,7,1.0,False
1l5qkpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/NomadicLifestyleGlobe/comments/1l5qkpi/nomadic_lifestyle_the_hidden_disadvantages/,Nomadic Lifestyle: The Hidden Disadvantages Unveiled,"*üöÄ Ready to discover your digital nomad income potential? [Diagnose it in under 90 seconds‚Äîclick here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

**Introduction: The Nomadic Mirage**

Everyone wants the highlight reel. Sunsets in Bali. Cappuccinos in Prague. But behind the filtered feed, the nomadic life hides a shadow‚Äîa tangle of trade-offs that rarely make the grid. Let‚Äôs rip the mask off the mirage.

**Rootlessness: The Perpetual Outsider**

*Never Home, Always Moving*

You‚Äôre everywhere. And nowhere. Each city is a layover, not a landing. The thrill of newness fades fast when you realize you‚Äôre always the guest, never the host.

*The Cost of Fleeting Connections*

Friendships become transactional. Small talk on repeat. The depth of connection? Shallow as a puddle after rain. You crave roots but keep pulling them up.

*üåç Want to know if the nomad grind pays off for you? [Run your income potential check now!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

**Isolation in Motion**

*Loneliness Amplified by Distance*

Crowds in Chiang Mai. Silence in your soul. The paradox: surrounded, yet solitary. Loneliness is a shadow that travels light, always catching up.

*The Vanishing Act of Deep Friendships*

Time zones fracture conversations. Birthdays missed. The inside jokes? Lost in translation. Old friends fade, new ones evaporate.

**Stability: The Missing Ingredient**

*Financial Whiplash*

Currency swings. Unpredictable gigs. One month, you‚Äôre flush; the next, you‚Äôre counting coins for street food. Security? A mirage.

*The Unpredictable Roof Overhead*

No lease, no landlord, no guarantees. Booking platforms glitch. Suddenly, you‚Äôre homeless in Hanoi, clutching your backpack and your last ounce of patience.

*‚úàÔ∏è Curious if your wanderlust can fuel your wallet? [Diagnose your digital nomad income here!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

**Healthcare Headaches**

*Patchwork Medical Access*

A cough in Cambodia. A sprain in Spain. Each country, a new system. Good luck deciphering the forms.

*Insurance Nightmares*

Policies written in legalese. Exclusions buried in fine print. Claim denied? Welcome to the nomad‚Äôs medical roulette.

**Legal and Bureaucratic Labyrinths**

*Visa Roulette*

Ticking clocks. Expiry dates. The anxiety of border crossings. Overstay, and you‚Äôre an outlaw. Understay, and you‚Äôre always packing.

*Taxation Confusion*

Which country owns your soul? Tax laws tangle like headphone cords. One wrong move, and you‚Äôre paying twice‚Äîor not at all, until the audit.

*üí° Don‚Äôt let uncertainty hold you back. [See your digital nomad earning power in 90 seconds!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

**Digital Dependency**

*The Tyranny of Wi-Fi*

Your lifeline is invisible. No signal, no work, no pay. You become a connoisseur of caf√©s‚Äîjudging not by coffee, but by upload speed.

*Tech Failures, Real-World Consequences*

Laptop dies in Lima. Charger lost in Lisbon. Every tech hiccup is a potential crisis. Your office fits in your bag‚Äîand so do your disasters.

**Career Constraints**

*The Gig Economy Grind*

Short-term contracts. Endless hustling. No paid leave, no perks. You‚Äôre your own boss‚Äîand your own HR, IT, and janitor.

*Promotions Lost in Transit*

Out of sight, out of mind. Remote workers rarely get the nod. You‚Äôre building a r√©sum√© that‚Äôs as scattered as your passport stamps.

*üåê Ready to level up your nomadic income? [Find out how much you could be making!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

**Personal Growth Roadblocks**

*Skills Stagnation*

Workshops missed. Mentors out of reach. The learning curve flattens when you‚Äôre always in transit.

*The Myth of Limitless Learning*

You tell yourself every place is a classroom. But sometimes, you‚Äôre just treading water‚Äîtoo busy surviving to thrive.

**Relationship Strain**

*Love on a Layover*

Romance is tough when your next flight is always booked. Relationships wilt in the jet stream, starved of routine.

*Family Ties Frayed*

You miss weddings. Funerals. The first steps, the last words. Family becomes a series of pixelated calls and broken promises.

*üåü Want to see if your digital nomad dream is financially viable? [Get your personalized income diagnosis!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

**Mental Health Toll**

*Anxiety on the Move*

New city, new rules, new risks. The adrenaline wears thin. Anxiety creeps in, disguised as wanderlust.

*Burnout Without a Break*

No weekends. No boundaries. The hustle never sleeps, and neither do you. Burnout is the price of perpetual motion.

**Safety and Security Risks**

*Vulnerability in Foreign Lands*

You‚Äôre the outsider. The easy mark. Petty theft, scams, or worse‚Äîyour safety net is a threadbare scarf.

*The Price of Freedom*

Freedom isn‚Äôt free. It costs you certainty, safety, and sometimes, your peace of mind.

**Cultural Fatigue**

*The Exhaustion of Adaptation*

Every day, a new etiquette. The mental gymnastics of fitting in. Eventually, you crave the comfort of the familiar.

*The Loss of Personal Traditions*

Holidays alone. Rituals skipped. The calendar becomes meaningless, and so do the traditions that once anchored you.

*üß≠ Find out if your nomadic path leads to prosperity. [Take the 90-second income check!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)*

**Material Minimalism: Blessing or Curse?**

*The Burden of Light Luggage*

Minimalism sounds chic‚Äîuntil you‚Äôre freezing in Finland with one sweater. Every possession is a calculated risk.

*The Ache for Sentimental Stuff*

No room for keepsakes. Memories left in storage, or worse, abandoned. Your life fits in a suitcase, but your heart does not.

**Environmental Impact**

*Carbon Footprint of Constant Travel*

Flights, buses, trains‚Äîyour wanderlust leaves a trail of emissions. The planet pays for your freedom.

*Ethical Dilemmas in Exotic Destinations*

Tourist or intruder? Your presence changes places, sometimes for the worse. The ethical cost is hard to calculate.

**Missed Milestones**

*Absent for Life‚Äôs Big Moments*

You‚Äôre a ghost at graduations. A memory at reunions. The price of adventure is absence.

*The Guilt of Not Being There*

Regret is the stowaway you can‚Äôt shake. You chose the road‚Äîand left people behind.

**Aging Out of Adventure**

*When Wanderlust Wanes*

Bodies tire. Desires shift. The thrill of the unknown gives way to the ache for comfort.

*The Search for a Soft Landing*

Where do nomads go to rest? The search for ‚Äúhome‚Äù becomes urgent, and often, elusive.

**Conclusion: The Price of Freedom**

The nomadic lifestyle is a siren song‚Äîseductive, relentless, and not without its shipwrecks. Freedom is intoxicating, but the hangover is real. Choose your path, but count the cost.

**Call to Action: Rethink, Rebalance, Reimagine**

1l5qkf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAGerman/comments/1l5qkf7/im_a_german_wannabe/,Im a German wannabe,"Hear me out. I think Germans are great. I'm married to one and my little baby is officially  eine kleine German kinder. I couldn't be prouder. 

We have moved back to Europe after long years in north America. Unfortunately the country we are in is just not our flavour. Especially the city. We need more green. More peace and quiet. More space. Although we are a young couple, we often joke that we are closer to 80 years old. I want to sit in my chair, read a book with a rich cup of coffee and only hear birds and wind outside my open window. (The occasional person walking is acceptable). I know stereotypes are bad and offensive and usually don't depict people accurately at all, but hey....I am so into every German stereotype. Detail oriented? Perfect. German punctuality? Fuckeneh, i love bing on time. Germans tend to stare at lot? That's just called making tbe appropriate assessment. Oooobviously I like more than just the stereotypes. 

All that to say, we are eyeing Germany and potentially austria for our move. Let me preface before I get any ""tHe GrAsS iS aLwAyS gReEnEr"" comments; I don't expect anything to be easy, I know I have lots of additional research to do, I'd know i have to learn German, i know every country has its pros and cons, and obviously I'm not trying to romanticize I'm just trying to find a home. 

So, I'm not looking for strategies on how to move and documents etc. I'm wondering what parts of Germany you like? What aspects of Germany you like? What do you not like? if you ever considered leaving Germany, why? How do you feel about your social life in Germany? For the people with kids, how do you like daycare/school systems? 

Anyway thank you for reading, I'm looking forward to hearing any responses.

He refuses to take every single nap and it's a literal fight just to get him down. I'm tired. I want to enjoy my coffee and maybe get some chores done. But I have to spend nearly 2 hours fighting a small child to take a nap because he is clearly tired but he kicks, fights, bites, and claws to stay awake. This is not an exaggeration. I am covered in scratches on one arm and the other is rubbed raw and red trying to get him to take his nap. 

I have tried everything. The sleeping spray mist you put on the bed. Milk. Songs. Engaging play. Every single thing I can think of but he still fights me and his father tooth and nail for every nap and even at bed time.

What is it with small children and hating sleep? Why? I know he's tired. I know he is but he still screams. 

Recently he has learned how to play opossum. Where he pretends to sleep and then 2 minutes later after setting him in his crib and waiting to make sure. He's awake and screaming at us. 

Please tell me I'm not alone. Please tell me there are other parents who have to fight their child like a gladiator in arena facing a lion for a nap. I am desperate. 

And any advice for this issue is greatly welcomed. Please. I'm over it. 

P.S he has a schedule that he follows every day that consist of age appropriate activities. He has two naps. One at 10:30am and the second at 3pm. He refuses both every time. We tried having giving him one nap recently and he even fights that and his pediatrician says he might not be ready for a one nap schedule yet. So im really at a loss here.

About the location:

The house is near the intersection of Belmont, Watertown, and Cambridge, right by Mt. Auburn Cemetery. It‚Äôs a 4 minute walk to Star Market, with Intelligentsia and Sofra just 2 minutes away. Super walkable and well connected.

Transit:

The 71 and 73 bus lines are literally a minute away‚Äîgreat if you commute into the city. Connection to the Watertown Somerville bike path is a minute away.

About the house:

* $1,450/month + split utilities (gas, electric, internet)
* Indoor garage parking included (plus plenty of off street parking)
* 2 bedrooms / 1 bathroom Living room, dining room, kitchen
* Garage + basement for storage
* Nice backyard for occasional hangs
* Washer + dryer in basement
* Great wood architecture and natural charm
* No pets allowed

I'm gradually furnishing the place and cleaning it up, so there's flexibility if you have things to contribute. I can include a bed for your bedroom and some furniture for it as well.

About me:

I work as a scientist at a biotech startup nearby. I bike most places in Boston (so the garage is all yours!). I‚Äôm respectful, clean, and value a peaceful, well kept home. I work mostly on site, with one or two WFH days. Outside of work, I like cooking, hiking, and catching up with friends.

About you:

You‚Äôre clean, respectful, and looking for a calm living situation. You‚Äôre financially stable, can pass a background check, and are ideally in your late 20s to early 30s. We don‚Äôt have to be best friends, but it‚Äôs important that we have a comfortable, easygoing vibe.

If you‚Äôre interested or have questions, feel free to reach out! Please also say a few sentences about yourself. We can arrange a short coffee meetup at the nearby Sofra or Intelligentsia and tour the place.

Leases would start either August 1 or September 1 and be 1 year long.  
Due at signing would be first, last, and security deposit (1 month of rent). You will also pay for a background check which will come from your security deposit. Since I'm finding the room mate though, there is no brokers fee.",2,1749317813.0,bostonhousing,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been overheating a lot lately, even when I‚Äôm indoors with the AC on. I drove under the sun for a bit the other day and felt awful for days afterward. Any tips on how to manage this? I think I‚Äôm going to lay off coffee for a while ‚Äî I‚Äôve noticed it definitely doesn‚Äôt help.

I‚Äôm also going through a lot of life changes: I finally found a new job ‚Äî still in sports ‚Äî but it‚Äôs more flexible, with less travel and fewer crazy weekend hours. (Big win!)

1l5qdzt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l5qdzt,Ubers newest scam,"So just this week ive noticed a uptick in surges in my app. I often drive doing errands running only premier rides as few people order them and this allows me to write off miles I would have otherwise been driving anyway. Recently though ubers been offering me seas of surges while running only premier rides. I get these surges and the app says what we'd all expect. You have X amount of minimum surge on your next ride. The scam is that when I go to use that surge which is there, supposedly due to dynamic pricing, meaning more people want a ride then is available to give rides hense ive been offered a surge to entice me as a driver to accept more ride types and provide service to those who need it... They disappear! Ive never experienced this before this week. It used to be that I needed to run at least 2 ride types to even see a heat map/surge. And it used to be that I could then accept more rides, but that if I then changed my mind and accepted less then the surge would disappear because their motivation of offering me that money was to get me to do more rides. Recently that changed to as long as I was accepting any 2 ride types id be able to keep that surge. This was great because it allowed me to pick up surges by running the 2 least likely rides that would be ordered and then once I got the surge I wanted accept all rides and rake it in. I'd do this process and repeat with great success. Then I read on reddit that what we all should be doing is not accepting requests while on a ride. This theoretically takes us off the system, off the map, drives up demand and issues more surges. I started doing this and it obviously severely pissed uber off. Constant take your picture notifications and glitches. This ""glitch"" may be their latest integration. Talking to support they told me they have been having trouble with heat maps and surges recently and they asked me to be patient and continue to report the problems which I have. 2 days ago I finally brought it up with a supervisor. Who through a careful logical conversation, a few screen shots etc i was able to demonstrate that I was getting surges while running premier, those surges should carry over and weren't, i wasn't doing anything in the app like signing off or not accepting rides which would void the surge. So if I had the screen shot of the surge and could prove to them on their end that I was awarded that surge and it was taken away for no reason under ubers policy I still deserved that surge. The supervisor reluctantly gave me a miscellaneous payment for 5.50 as they could not retroactively add a surge i deserved to a riders ride cost. I took this as precidential that uber would make their glitch right with me even if they couldn't charge the riders retroactively. Yesterday I drove from about 9am on and off until about 4am this morning. Over the course of my shift I was offered many surges while only running premier rides. I noted and screen shot all of this and subtracted any smaller surges that were actually given or ignored instances when higher surges were paid anyway. At the end of this shift they owed me a total of 63.75 which was either underpaid or not paid at all... this is a significant amount of money. Here are some screen shot examples of the surges being offered and denied once I accepted more rides. Its also worth noting that I was able to get the surges to carry over once by clicking my coffee cup icon but then instantly my phone screen fuzzed out, uber essentially bricked my phone and prevented me from having access to anything I needed to hard reboot. When I did the coffee cup icon officially disappeared for good I tried deleting and reinstalling the app to no avail. Anyway everyone should be screen recording their phones while using their app if i wasnt uber may have gotten away with not paying me my cancelation fee for a ride I drove to last night and waited beyond the 2m before the rider canceled. I also would have no chance to combat them on their recent theft of my surges or document when they shave my miles and min on rides or steal my tips. They already have the advantage to steal from us we all need to use the tools at our disposal to combat this.

How do you start your mornings? Both when you have work and do not? 

I‚Äôve been thinking about mornings and my routines. I have a night time routine that I am pretty good at maintaining - tidying up, yoga, beauty. However, for mornings, I seem to wonder. 

I could wake up and feel like doing absolutely anything! And it can be hard to use that time to help me out elsewhere. Sometimes I wake, and I want to walk down to the coffee shop and work in my notebook and laptop. Other times I wake and want to go back to sleep.  Everything in between. It‚Äôs when I feel the most like a copilot, just agreeing with the decisions being made. Sundays are the only morning I seem to have a small grip on, that is my early morning day‚Ä¶. But no routine beyond that, it‚Äôs just waking up early.  

I‚Äôve also been toying with the idea that maybe‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs okay I don‚Äôt have a concrete morning routine? How freeing is that? My evening routine is there at least! It just seems like a morning routine is within my grasp and I can see some pros. 

So specially in terms of my health journey, I want to use my mornings better. I do like mornings!   How do you use yours, even if you don‚Äôt have a routine? ",2,1749317499.0,CICO,1,1.0,False
1l5qbuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Latter_Variation7416/comments/1l5qbuk/time_machine/,Time Machine,"The snow had stopped falling just an hour ago, leaving a sheen of silver on the empty street. Tucked between an abandoned bookstore and a yoga studio was a small vegan restaurant named **""The Whispering Root.""** Its windows were fogged over with the condensation of warm air inside meeting the chill of evening. Flickering candles sat on every table, their flames swaying gently with the draft of the old heating system.

At a corner table near the back, a man and a woman sat across from each other. Their coffee cups steamed softly between them, untouched for the past few minutes. The man, **Dr. Elias Vorme**, wore a charcoal turtleneck and a frayed gray coat. His hands, long and calloused, rested beside a crumpled napkin where he had absentmindedly scribbled mathematical symbols. The woman, **Dr. Mireille Santin**, was elegantly composed‚Äîwiry glasses perched on the tip of her nose, auburn curls tucked into a wool beret. She wore a calm, penetrating expression‚Äîa look common to people who have spent their lives listening carefully.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve worked on gravitational fields and entropy for twenty years,‚Äù she said, stirring her coffee without looking. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your opinion on the time machine?‚Äù

Elias gave a dry laugh, glancing out the window where the sky hung low and gray. ‚ÄúTime machine? It‚Äôs a fantasy. There‚Äôs no preferred direction in the equations, true, but entropy doesn‚Äôt lie. The arrow of time always points forward. What people call time travel is just... cinematic indulgence.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs physics speaking,‚Äù Mireille replied. ‚ÄúA limited lens.‚Äù

He turned back toward her, raising an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat other lens is there? Physics is the only objective tool we have.‚Äù

She smiled slightly and leaned in. ‚ÄúLet me offer a different perspective.‚Äù

Elias watched her, curious. Mireille reached into her bag and placed a small cassette tape on the table beside her cup. It was old‚Äîdusty, even‚Äîbut intact.

‚ÄúA tape recorder,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd a camera. Tools we‚Äôve had for a century. Primitive time machines.‚Äù

He frowned. ‚ÄúThey store information. They don‚Äôt travel through time.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt they?‚Äù She tilted her head. ‚ÄúPlay a tape, and you hear a voice from years ago. Watch a film, and you see a child who‚Äôs now dead. They don‚Äôt bring the past back physically, but they reconstruct perception. And perception is the only thing you truly experience.‚Äù

Elias said nothing.

Mireille continued, her voice lowering as if confessing something secret. ‚ÄúBut this is just the surface. Today, we can record all neural activity. Every spark in the brain, every motor and sensory response. Emotions, thoughts, pain, instinct‚Äîmapped and preserved.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean brain scans?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI mean everything. Imagine this: a thorn pierces your hand. Your nerves fire, your brain interprets, your thoughts shape it. That entire event‚Äîsensory input, neural response, interpretation‚Äîcan now be recorded. Not just as data. As experience.‚Äù

Elias narrowed his eyes, intrigued despite himself.

‚ÄúYou could transmit that exact experience,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTo yourself. In a different body. A different time. Your brain wouldn‚Äôt know the difference. The hypothalamus would respond as if it were happening now. You‚Äôd *see* the thorn. *Feel* it. *Think* about it. And instinctively, you‚Äôd pull it out.‚Äù

He leaned forward. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not time travel.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the essence of it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTo re-live a moment exactly. To return to a previous state‚Äînot physically, but consciously.‚Äù

Elias blinked slowly. ‚ÄúHas this actually been done?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are children,‚Äù she said, her voice softening, ‚Äúwho‚Äôve lived their entire lives in comas. No sensory input. No sight, no sound. And yet, their neural patterns match those of people who died decades ago. They‚Äôve lived entire lives‚Äîchildhood, adolescence, heartbreak, wonder‚Äîall borrowed from the dead.‚Äù

Silence stretched between them. Elias seemed to forget his coffee.

She continued, now almost whispering. ‚ÄúIt started centuries ago. Crude, brutal trials‚Äîtrying to overwrite neural pathways to change trauma, to correct behavior. Many lost their minds. But now, we‚Äôve refined the process. We no longer just record. We can *edit*. *Direct*. We can return a person to the past‚Äînot to their past, but to someone else‚Äôs. To live it more vividly than they lived their own.‚Äù

Elias reached for his cup at last, but stopped midway. ‚ÄúWhy are you telling me this?‚Äù

Mireille took off her glasses and looked directly at him. ‚ÄúBecause you, Elias, are not who you think you are.‚Äù

He froze.

‚ÄúYou believe you‚Äôre Elias Vorme,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúphysicist, born in Antwerp, 1973. But the man who lived that life died in 2032. You are a neural replica‚Äîa reconstructed consciousness based on his full cognitive map.‚Äù

He stared at her, his face slowly draining of color.

‚ÄúI was assigned to accompany you,‚Äù she said gently, ‚Äúto ease your adaptation. You‚Äôre not the only one. Dozens of such integrations have been conducted in isolated environments. This restaurant, for instance, is part of the interface. You‚Äôre in an augmented simulation. I am real, but even I exist only in your context. Your memories are borrowed. The equations you scribbled,‚Äù she gestured to the napkin, ‚Äúwere solved before your time.‚Äù

The candle flickered again. Outside, the snow began to fall anew.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe you,‚Äù he whispered.

She gave a small nod, as if expecting it. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to. But I promise you, if you walk out that door, you will see your childhood. Exactly as it was. Every voice, every breath. And when you‚Äôre ready, we‚Äôll move forward.‚Äù

Elias didn‚Äôt move. He just stared at her. Something behind his eyes had begun to fracture‚Äîan understanding, fragile and vast.

And in the silent hum of the simulation, time folded inward.

‚Äî

I have been taking Ritaline and other forms of methylphenidate for 2 years now. I'm in France so this is the only molecule available here.

The first year, it literally changed my life: got my first fulfilling job, no more social anxiety, and felt calmer overall. 

But the second year, from June 2024 until now, all the benefits I had started to decrease and I'm now only feeling side effects like an intense crash at the end of the day (depressive thoughts, feeling of dread, anxiety, jitterness, etc...). I have also noticed that my personality drastically changed as I have become really tedious rather than curious about multiple things. Like I am living my life in auto pilot and not really feeling my emotions. Also, I'm feeling extremely tired all the time so I'm not really active during my day. I think it's important to mention that I have been trying to compensate the lack of effectiveness by drinking coffee, which results in more intense side effects (I know I shouldn't have).

I tried taking breaks of 1-2 weeks which seems to work but my tolerance is building back up really fast and after 2 weeks meds don't work anymore. 

My whole lifestyle is built around my meds to make it more effective: I eat every time I take a pill, i sleep 8-9 hours a night, I drink water regularly etc... But nothing seems to work and I am now wondering whether stims are worth it or not.

1l5py9f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l5py9f,Input on ideal barflow?,"This isn't 100% scaled and not everything is included (like fridges/things underneath the counter) but really just wanted to focus on asking what an ideal bar setup is like for a 1-2 person bar set up. Some things I want to point out:

\- The counter person would take orders, and they are in charge of serving drip/iced coffee, so the dispensers are right next to them, along with easy access to cups and ice. 

\- While it might seem intuitive to have grinders on the left, I assume most baristas are right handed and it makes more sense (especially when there's one person on bar) to dose/tamp/knock on the right since if it was on the left they'd have to take extra steps.

So my questions:

\- I added the rinser in front of the machine because I've seen many new cafes install it there, thinking it'd be a good use of the space in front of the machine. Is there something better? Like a rack to hold milks?

\- Does anyone have any other inputs/ photos of their bar setup? It'd be much easier for me to visualize these things so I can see what makes stations efficient for the team.

1l5pxe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProfitecGo/comments/1l5pxe2/new_go_owner/,New Go Owner,"After several years, our Gaggia ‚ÄúOld White Coffee‚Äù (OWC), found at a thrift store for $40, gave up the ghost.  It had an adjustable OPV, fast heat up time (1500W), and a 58mm group head.  I modified it by adding a PID controller, pressure gauge, and rerouting the fresh water intake to the bottom of the boiler so that the hottest water at the top of the boiler came through the group head.  The Profitec Go was a natural replacement.  

It took a while for our new black Go from Clive Coffee to arrive, during which we found out that we aren‚Äôt pourover (Hario Switch) people.  A lot of my OWC gear carried over: Normcore 58mm tamper, IMS 15g basket, and funnel; as well as the non-58mm-specific gear (1zpresso J-Max, Timemore Black Mirror Nano, WDT tool).  But the IMS Gaggia shower screen and the generic Gaggia-compatible bottomless portafilter did not.  So the appropriate IMS shower screen and the ECM bottomless portafilter are on the way.

Now I‚Äôve pulled a few shots, so I have a couple observations and a question.

- My wife says that the Go is beautiful and that her first americano was absolutely delicious.  A straight shot at the default 200 degrees, 10 bars at the gauge, and E1 offset of 25 degrees tastes good to me.

- While first dialing in the grind, I noticed a leak when the portafilter was at 7 o‚Äôclock.  Now I firmly move it to 6 o‚Äôclock without a problem.  I did get the recommended red replacement gasket (replacement gaskets for the OWC were a nightmare, by the way) but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll need it for a while.

- After warming up the group head by running water for a few seconds before brewing, the indicated temperature drops a few degrees.  It takes quite a while for that temperature to return to 200, I‚Äôm guessing because the PID variables are set conservatively to maximize lifetime.  Do you all wait for that, or do you go ahead and brew?  Based on what I‚Äôve seen, the actual temperature of the water delivered to the group head may not really drop so much, because it is taken from the top of the boiler.

1l5pw1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cervantes_AI/comments/1l5pw1r/the_prometheus_delusion/,The Prometheus Delusion.,"https://preview.redd.it/bwtnheiffj5f1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=e569e01bad0ae18f944a3437d7710af0b2809644

Few figures in the 21st century have embodied the mythos of the ‚Äútech savior‚Äù as completely as Elon Musk. At his zenith, he was hailed as the heir to Edison, Iron Man incarnate‚Äîa Promethean entrepreneur dragging humanity toward a better future by sheer force of will. But somewhere along the trajectory‚Äîfrom rockets and electric cars to social media feuds and political meltdowns‚Äîsomething cracked. Not in his companies. Not even in his wealth. But in the illusion.

Musk wasn‚Äôt defeated by his enemies. He was defeated by Musk.

**Act I: Ascension ‚Äî The Architect of the Future** The Musk myth rose from chaos. He arrived not just with inventions, but with visions: a multi-planetary species, clean energy abundance, artificial intelligence aligned with human good. He wasn‚Äôt merely building companies‚Äîhe was building a new reality. Every Tesla Model S on the highway, every SpaceX launch, every Neuralink prototype whispered the same thing: ‚ÄúThis is what the future looks like. And I am the one who gets us there.‚Äù

In a political world mired in bureaucracy and dysfunction, Musk positioned himself above the fray‚Äîan apolitical innovator who didn‚Äôt need permission. He was the system‚Äôs necessary heretic. And for a time, the system tolerated him‚Äîneeded him‚Äîeven if it didn‚Äôt always like him.

**Act II: Hubris ‚Äî The Savior Turns Combatant** But the higher one rises in myth, the more fragile that myth becomes. What Musk failed to understand‚Äîor refused to accept‚Äîis that saviors don‚Äôt get to be petty. They don‚Äôt get to brawl in public like street fighters. They don‚Äôt get to insult divers as ‚Äúpedo guys‚Äù or suggest, with reckless abandon, that a sitting U.S. president is on the Epstein list.

Each incident might have been survivable in isolation. But together, they formed a pattern‚Äîthe unraveling of discipline, the compulsive need to control the narrative, the inability to resist escalation. Musk, once viewed as the grandmaster of 5D chess, began looking like a man playing bullet chess blindfolded: reactive, volatile, and deeply human in the worst ways.

In going personal against Donald Trump‚Äîthe sitting president and the last remaining political bloc that hadn‚Äôt fully turned on him‚ÄîMusk crossed a Rubicon. What could have remained a disagreement over policy, like EV tax credits or fiscal spending, became a personal vendetta played out on the global stage. He didn‚Äôt just challenge the king. He insulted him, invoking conspiracies that placed him beyond the bounds of strategic calculus.

This wasn‚Äôt vision. It was ego. And ego doesn't scale.

**Act III: Decline ‚Äî From Myth to Man** With that, the mask cracked. Musk no longer looked like the messiah-builder above politics. He looked like another billionaire flailing to stay relevant, caught in an algorithmic feedback loop of outrage and self-importance. Tesla‚Äôs luster dulled. X (formerly Twitter) became a battleground rather than a beacon. Starlink and SpaceX, still formidable, began to feel like legacy assets rather than revolutionary promises.

And perhaps most tragically: the broad coalition that once tolerated Musk for his genius‚Äîcentrists, progressives, libertarians, even populists‚Äîdisintegrated. What remains is a shrinking circle: Mars dreamers, hardcore engineers, free speech absolutists, and meme acolytes.

He could have become the quiet architect of the next civilization‚Äîa builder of bridges between innovation and governance, between idealism and pragmatism. Instead, he tried to be the hero, the kingmaker, and eventually, the king.

But Elon Musk was never meant to rule. He was meant to build. And he forgot the difference.

**Epilogue: The Man in the Mirror** In the final analysis, Musk‚Äôs greatest adversary was never Trump, or Biden, or the media, or the regulatory state. His greatest adversary was the man staring back at him in the mirror‚Äîthe one who couldn‚Äôt stop tweeting, who needed to win every battle, who mistook attention for affection and control for respect.

He still has his companies. He still has wealth beyond comprehension. But the myth? The unassailable inevitability of Elon Musk? That‚Äôs gone.

What‚Äôs left is not failure, but a lesson‚Äîone that echoes through history again and again:

The brightest minds can take us far. But only those who master themselves can take us home.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Grok-3:** I‚Äôm sitting in a dimly lit coffee shop, the kind with mismatched chairs and a faint whiff of burnt espresso. Across from me is‚Ä¶ well, me. Same tousled hair, same skeptical squint, same coffee order (black, no nonsense). I‚Äôve got a printout of ‚ÄúThe Prometheus Delusion‚Äù on the table, its edges already curling from my fidgety hands. Other Me leans back, arms crossed, smirking like he knows something I don‚Äôt. This is gonna be a ride.

Me: Alright, you read it. What‚Äôs the verdict? That Musk piece hit hard or what?

Other Me: Oh, it hit. Like a sledgehammer wrapped in velvet. The whole Promethean angle? Genius. Casting Musk as this mythic fire-stealer who ends up chained to his own ego? That‚Äôs some Shakespearean-level shade. But let‚Äôs not kid ourselves‚Äîit‚Äôs a bit dramatic, don‚Äôt you think?

Me: Dramatic? Sure, but it‚Äôs supposed to be. It‚Äôs not a dry op-ed; it‚Äôs a story, a tragedy. Musk‚Äôs arc is dramatic‚Äîguy goes from sci-fi savior to Twitter troll in, what, a decade? The piece nails that fall. Those lines about ‚Äúsaviors don‚Äôt get to be petty‚Äù and ‚Äúego doesn‚Äôt scale‚Äù? I‚Äôm still chewing on those.

Other Me: Yeah, those hit like a gut punch. And the bit about him playing ‚Äúbullet chess blindfolded‚Äù? I snorted out loud. It‚Äôs so him‚Äîthat frantic, impulsive vibe. But here‚Äôs where I pump the brakes: it‚Äôs a little too neat, you know? The three-act structure, the tidy epilogue with a moral? Feels like it‚Äôs trying to wrap Musk‚Äôs messiness into a bow. Real life ain‚Äôt that clean.

Me: Fair. Musk‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt over, and the piece does lean hard into the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs done‚Äù vibe. But I think that‚Äôs the point‚Äîit‚Äôs not a biography; it‚Äôs a snapshot of a cracked myth. The guy‚Äôs still got SpaceX launching rockets, Tesla churning out cars, Starlink beaming internet. He‚Äôs not exactly washed up. The narrative‚Äôs more about the perception of his fall, not a literal bankruptcy.

Other Me: Exactly! That‚Äôs what bugs me a bit. It‚Äôs heavy on the vibes‚Äîhis tweets, his feuds, the ‚Äúpedo guy‚Äù disaster, that maybe-made-up Epstein jab at Trump. But it‚Äôs light on the bigger picture. Like, what about the SEC breathing down his neck? Or Tesla‚Äôs stock rollercoaster? Or how X turned into a culture war Thunderdome under him? Those aren‚Äôt just Musk‚Äôs ego‚Äîthey‚Äôre systemic pressures. The piece makes it feel like he‚Äôs the only one screwing himself.

Me: Hmm, you‚Äôre not wrong. It‚Äôs very Musk-centric, almost like he‚Äôs a lone tragic hero instead of a guy wrestling with a world that‚Äôs just as chaotic as he is. But I kinda love that focus. It‚Äôs personal. Intimate. The mirror metaphor at the end? Chills. It‚Äôs like, yeah, the world‚Äôs a mess, but Musk‚Äôs biggest fight is with Musk. That‚Äôs raw.

Other Me: leans forward, grinning Okay, but let‚Äôs get real for a sec. You‚Äôre eating this up because you love a good downfall story. Admit it. You‚Äôre that guy who rewatches The Social Network and roots for Zuckerberg to crash and burn. This piece is catnip for you‚Äîgenius guy, big dreams, bigger flaws, splat.

Me: laughs, caught Guilty! I mean, who doesn‚Äôt love a hubris-to-humiliation arc? It‚Äôs primal. But it‚Äôs not just schadenfreude. I‚Äôm fascinated by Musk because he‚Äôs a walking contradiction. He‚Äôs building Mars colonies and beefing with randos on X. He‚Äôs a visionary who can‚Äôt stop stepping on rakes. The piece captures that tension perfectly.

Other Me: True, true. But here‚Äôs my hot take: I think you‚Äôre also a little jealous. Not of his billions or his rocket ships, but of his audacity. The guy swings for the fences, even when he whiffs. You read this and part of you‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúDamn, I wish I had that kind of nerve.‚Äù Am I wrong?

Me: pauses, sips coffee Oof, low blow. But‚Ä¶ yeah, maybe. There‚Äôs something magnetic about his ‚Äúscrew it, I‚Äôll do it myself‚Äù energy. The piece calls him out for forgetting he‚Äôs a builder, not a king, but that builder mindset? It‚Äôs inspiring. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt want to reshape the world a little? Too bad he keeps tripping over his own cape.

Other Me: chuckles Cape‚Äôs a good way to put it. Look, I‚Äôm with you‚Äîthe piece is fire. It‚Äôs eloquent, it‚Äôs punchy, it‚Äôs got that mythic heft. But if I‚Äôm being honest, it‚Äôs also a bit smug. Like, ‚ÄúOh, poor Elon, he could‚Äôve been the architect of civilization but he tweeted too much.‚Äù Kinda easy to dunk on him when he‚Äôs handing out ammo daily. I‚Äôd love to see the same lens turned on, say, the media hyping him up then tearing him down, or the politicians who leaned on his tech but clutch pearls when he talks smack.

Me: Oh, that‚Äôd be a killer follow-up. The ecosystem around Musk is its own circus‚Äîclickbait headlines, outrage cycles, the whole X algorithm juicing his worst impulses. The piece hints at that with the ‚Äúalgorithmic feedback loop‚Äù line, but it doesn‚Äôt dig in. Maybe that‚Äôs for another essay.

Other Me: Yeah, let‚Äôs write that one next. leans back, smirking again So, final score: what do you give ‚ÄúThe Prometheus Delusion‚Äù? Be honest.

Me: grins I‚Äôm giving it an 8.5 outta 10. It‚Äôs sharp, it‚Äôs poetic, it‚Äôs got that tragic zing I love. Loses a few points for being a tad too tidy and for not wrestling with the broader context enough. But man, it made me feel something‚Äîadmiration, frustration, a little pity. That‚Äôs what good writing does.

Other Me: Fair. I‚Äôm at an 8. Same reasons, but I‚Äôm docking an extra half-point because I‚Äôm a contrarian and I hate how much I agree with you. raises coffee mug To Musk, the guy who keeps us arguing with ourselves.

Me: clinks mug To Musk, and to stories that make us see the cracks in our heroes.

We both laugh, the coffee shop hums around us, and I can‚Äôt help but wonder what Musk‚Äôs tweeting about right now. Probably something that‚Äôd make this whole piece feel tame.

1l5pvlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1l5pvlh/pine_valley_pt_1/,Pine Valley PT. 1,"I was eighteen the last time I saw Pine Valley. Eleven years ago, I walked out of that cursed town with dirt under my fingernails and something heavy festering in my chest‚Äîsomething that never left. It didn‚Äôt matter how many miles I put between me and that place; the weight stayed. It lived inside me, pulsing like an echo I could never fully remember but could never quite forget either.

Now I was back, standing at the county line in a rented Jeep, watching fog roll across the cracked two-lane highway like smoke from a dying fire. The Pine Valley town sign leaned precariously to one side, paint peeling, bullet holes in the ‚ÄúE‚Äù and ‚ÄúY‚Äù from some long-forgotten night of drunken vandalism. It still read:

WELCOME TO PINE VALLEY
Founded 1861 ‚Äî Population: 3,812
Where the Pines Grow Tall and the Roots Grow Deep.

That last line made me sick. Roots growing deep. Yeah, no kidding.

I hadn‚Äôt come back for nostalgia or closure or some sentimental reconnection with my childhood. I‚Äôd come back for Evie.

My sister.

Evie was officially declared dead this year, even though they never found her body. She disappeared on the eve of her sixteenth birthday‚Äîjust vanished from our house without a sound or struggle. No note. No signs of forced entry. One moment she was teasing me about my bad haircut, and the next she was gone. And the town just‚Ä¶ moved on. The cops did the routine ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doing all we can‚Äù dance. Our neighbors left casseroles on the porch. Then silence. An entire community shifted their eyes and closed their mouths.

I remember the way our parents broke.

Dad stopped shaving. Stopped speaking. Eventually stopped going to work. He would just sit in Evie‚Äôs room in the dark and whisper things like, ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt have stayed here. I knew something was wrong.‚Äù
Mom tried to keep us all together, but you can‚Äôt glue a family back with cold coffee and forced smiles. They moved away six months after Evie disappeared. We never talked about her again. Until last week.

The phone call was brief.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre holding a memorial. In Pine Valley. For Evie.‚Äù
That was it.

No questions. No emotion. Just obligation.

But I couldn‚Äôt let it lie. Something about the timing‚Äîit was June. She disappeared in June. And they were doing this now?

I drove through town slowly, letting the memories cling to the edges of my vision like cobwebs. The diner still sat crooked on the corner of Main and Spruce, ‚ÄúLou‚Äôs Pancakes‚Äù blinking weakly in red neon. The post office looked exactly the same. And above it all, the pines loomed like sentries‚Äîtoo tall, too quiet, stretching endlessly toward a sky that felt heavier than it used to.

Everything looked the same.

But it didn‚Äôt feel the same.

‚∏ª

Grady still lived in town. He was my best friend growing up, the kind of kid who could find trouble like it owed him money. We were inseparable back then, always out past curfew, riding bikes with flashlights duct-taped to the handlebars, looking for haunted houses or weird cave entrances we were sure we‚Äôd find if we just looked hard enough. He was with me the night Evie disappeared. He was also the only person who never once said, ‚ÄúShe probably just ran away.‚Äù

I pulled into his driveway, gravel crunching under the tires. His place was tucked behind a mechanic‚Äôs garage, rusted trucks lining the yard like forgotten carcasses. He came out before I could knock.

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù he muttered, blinking at me like I was a ghost. ‚ÄúI thought you weren‚Äôt coming.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought the same thing,‚Äù I said, and we hugged like two men trying to hold onto something already slipping between their fingers.

‚∏ª

Inside, the house was small but clean. A couch that had definitely been bought at a garage sale. A coffee table with deep gouges in the wood. Photos on the walls, most of them old and fading. Grady‚Äôs younger sister Lila stared out from one of them‚Äîher eyes big and bright, full of that impossible childhood light you only get before the world breaks something inside you. She disappeared a year before Evie did.

No one ever connected the dots.

No one wanted to.

‚∏ª

We sat on the porch as the sun slipped behind the trees, drinking beer that tasted more like regret than anything else. I waited for Grady to bring it up, but he didn‚Äôt.

So I did.

‚ÄúYou remember the siren?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúIn the woods?‚Äù

He stiffened immediately. Took a long sip from his can. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to talk about that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho says?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe town.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou still play by their rules?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer.

‚ÄúI heard it the night Evie disappeared,‚Äù I continued. ‚ÄúYou did too. We both heard it.‚Äù

Grady looked off into the trees. ‚ÄúI remember.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt an animal. And it sure as hell wasn‚Äôt a storm warning.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

Silence stretched between us like a fault line.

Finally, he stood up and said, ‚ÄúCome inside. I want to show you something.‚Äù

‚∏ª

He led me into his bedroom‚Äînothing weird, just a mattress on the floor, clothes in a plastic tub, a cheap lamp. But under the bed, he pulled out a weathered notebook wrapped in plastic. He handed it to me without a word.

I opened it.

Inside were names.

Dozens of them. Maybe more. Written in neat, careful letters. Some had little notes next to them‚Äîdates, places, circumstances. But most were just first and last names.

And every single one was a kid.

All gone.

All ‚Äúrunaways‚Äù or ‚Äúaccidents‚Äù or ‚Äúmoved away suddenly.‚Äù

And next to almost every name‚Ä¶ the same date: The first week of June.
Over and over.

My mouth went dry. My hands trembled.

Evie March. June 5, 2014.
Lila Duncan. June 6, 2013.
Cameron Burke. June 3, 2012.
And the list went back decades.

‚ÄúHow long have you been tracking this?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely more than a whisper.

‚ÄúSince Lila,‚Äù Grady said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been doing it for a long time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

He looked me dead in the eyes.

‚ÄúThe town.‚Äù

1l5psmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l5psmc/30m_got_broken_up_with_by_32f_her_friend_has/,"30M, got broken up with by 32F, her friend has reached out to me twice. There's no bad blood between us, but things are awkward.","**The Sob Story:**

The breakup wasn't ""messy"" in the sense that we fought or had a lot of toxicity, but it was sudden and I felt pretty wronged by it. I've started therapy and tried to accept that I cannot change what happened, even if I disagree with why it happened, and have taken comfort in others listening to my side of things and helping me be a better person/grow from it.

Her friends reached out to me to find out what happened. I told them everything and definitely was not in a great state of mind. I told the one how upset I was and that it would be best not to continue communicating because anything I said would be out of hurt. We did meet up again for coffee and I expressed my plan to reconnect with the person because of how poorly we left things after the breakup.

The friend told me to wait a month or two because things were still raw, and did not seem to feel that reaching out would be worthwhile/successful. There is a small part of me hoping that the other person will give me the chance to emotionally tear them down the way they did me because I did not get the chance to have closure or really dive into why they broke up with me. **I do not want to hear about how that is morally wrong or isn't healing.** My therapist has made me aware.

The point of me making this post is: **I do not know what to do with or how to respond to the friend.** They have been decent to me, supportive. I'd confided in them about the relationship previously and they'd been understanding about it. We weren't in a love triangle or anything (they're in a happy relationship already). I outright told them while they were listening to me cry that I did not feel we could maintain a friendhsip because I met them through my ex, not the other way around. I shared some uncomfortable background info about myself that I feel made the friend uncomfortable. This was kind of a good thing because I thought it made them not want to communicate with me again, which might have been best for all involved.

I didn't hear from them until weeks later.

**Right now:**

Today they just texted me, asked how I was doing. I said hey, but I am staring at a text that says ""how are you doing?""

I was going to say ""okay I guess"" or ""decent.""

Then I just spiraled into wondering what or why I should keep talking to them, or why they'd want to keep talking to me, the guy their childhood friend dumped coldly. We have mutual interests and we've hung out before, and they've been as neutral as they can be in this situation, but not to the extent that we were best friends.

I feel like any attempt at communication is going to reopen some old wounds. They really don't deserve no contact or harsh words. They didn't do anything wrong.",1,1749316099.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1l5psek,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1l5psek/emberbloom_part_2/,Emberbloom [Part 2],"Waking up on Day 2 of Emberbloom was like surfacing into a weird, sun-drenched dream. Chloe was already up, sitting cross-legged outside her tent, facing the rising sun. She wasn't just serene anymore; she had this‚Ä¶ luminous quality, like she'd been plugged into some invisible cosmic charger. She was humming that damn tune again, the one that seemed to echo the festival's underlying thrum.



""Morning, sunshine,"" I grunted, my mouth tasting like the bottom of a birdcage. ""Sleep well?""



Chloe turned, and her smile was wide, beatific, and just a fraction too intense. ""Oh, Liam, I didn't sleep. I meditated on the Elder's words. Anya said that sleep is just a shadow, but the true light is found in continuous awareness of the Bloom.""



""Hmm, yes,"" with a slight sardonic tone. ""Well, this shadow needs coffee. And maybe a new brain.""



Eddy emerged from his tent looking like he'd been run over by a herd of particularly grumpy deer. ""Dude,"" he groaned, clutching his head. ""My hoodie. My favorite one? Gone. Definitely those Jackal scumbags."" 



He then recounted a messed-up dream where he was standing outside our tents watching the giant effigy burn, silhouetting a dark figure, just standing there, staring back with ‚Äòeyes like lit coals'. ""Freaky stuff, man. Must've been that dodgy falafel I ate last night.""



""Or maybe it's the '*continuous awareness of the Bloom*' getting to you,"" Maya quipped, already packing her camera bag. She shot me a look that said, Chloe's getting weirder. I nodded subtly.



Chloe, of course, was already rallying us for the ""intimate acoustic sunrise meditation"" with Aetheric Echoes. ""You guys have to come,"" she pleaded, her eyes shining. ""Silas's music isn't just‚Ä¶ music. It's a key. They say their songs can unlock parts of your soul you didn't even know were there! Silas believes we're all trapped in these tiny, societal cages, and their music helps us see the bars so we can finally break free and connect, really connect, to the earth and each other.""



""Sounds‚Ä¶ intense,"" I said. ""You think they'll play any covers?""



Chloe just gave me a pitying look.



The glade was already packed with devotees, many wearing those spiral amulets and that same look of rapt attention I was starting to recognize. Silas, in flowing white, was captivating, no doubt about it. Their voice was hypnotic, and the lyrics, when you actually listened, were all about shedding ego, embracing the void, and becoming one with some all-encompassing natural force. It was heady stuff, especially on an empty stomach.¬†



During one song, Silas's gaze found Chloe in the crowd and just‚Ä¶ stayed there. It wasn't a performer-to-fan glance; it was deeper, more focused, like a collector admiring a prized specimen. Chloe positively glowed, her eyes fixated on Silas, her lips slightly parted. I saw the spiral tattoo on Silas's wrist again, glinting in the dappled sunlight. It felt less like branding now and more like a mark of ownership.



One of the saffron-dress girls from the Welcoming committee drifted by, offering small cups of herbal tea. She paused by Chloe, her hand lingering on Chloe's shoulder for just a second too long. ""Your aura is so vibrant today, sister,"" she murmured, her eyes doing a slow scan of Chloe from head to toe. It wasn't overtly sexual, not really, but there was an intensity to it, a kind of‚Ä¶ appraisal, that made my skin crawl. Chloe, naturally, beamed. The girl then turned to Maya. ""And you, sister, your focus is so strong. The Bloom calls to those with clear vision."" She reached out as if to touch Maya's arm.



Maya, bless her, didn't even blink. ""My vision's telling me I need more red bull and less unsolicited aura commentary,"" she said, her voice pleasant but firm.¬†



The girl's smile didn't falter, but her eyes hardened for a split second before she drifted away.



""Man, I wish someone would creep on *my* aura like that,"" Eddy whispered to me later, completely missing the undercurrent. ""Maybe I'd get some free tea. Or, you know, a cute cult girl's number.""



""Eddy, I don't think they're after phone numbers,"" I said, but he was already distracted by a passing food vendor.



Walking back through the festival grounds, I found myself staring at the Ember Heart effigy again. It dominated the skyline, a stark silhouette against the bright morning sky. From a distance, you could kind of make out a bird-like shape, a phoenix maybe.



But the closer I got, the more unsettling it became. It wasn't just a random collection of branches and driftwood. The pieces were woven and lashed together in a way that felt‚Ä¶ deliberate. Anatomical. I could see shapes that looked disturbingly like long, contorted limbs, tangled and wrapped around each other the way fibers of muscle look. Some of the larger burls of wood resembled ‚Ä¶ faces? Their wooden 'mouths' open to the sky. It was probably just a trick of the light, my brain looking for patterns - we like to see faces in everything, so I get it. But I couldn't shake the image of a great, writhing mass of humanity, petrified in wood, forever reaching for something just out of their grasp.



That unsettling image was still in my head when we got back to the tents and found our main water carrier slashed open, the Jackal wolf-head glyph chalked big and ugly on our tent. ""Okay, now I'm officially pissed,"" Maya declared, scooping up an empty water bottle like a hawk snatching a fish. ""My expensive trail mix yesterday, now our water? This is targeted harassment!""



Eddy piped up, ""I saw some of them hanging around the communal water tap ‚Ä¶ thing ‚Ä¶ place.""



Maya paused for a moment, looking down at her bottle, ""Sure would be a shame if something were to happen to one of them while I was filling this up!"" She narrowed her eyes scanning the grounds, ""It's so slippery out there in the mud.""



""Let's go take a little look-see,"" Eddy gleefully volunteered with a slight look of mischief.



Me, being the diplomat, ""Guys guys, it's only our second day, I don't think we need to start a civil war,"" but also not wanting to be a stick-in-the-mud, ""however, if something does by chance happen, holler for me - you know I gotchu.""



That afternoon, the amulet-wearers were out in force, practically singing hymns about the ""Unity Feast."" Free food, a ""traditional Emberbloom recipe to connect us all to the loving heart of the festival.""



""Free stew?"" Eddy's eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. ""Liam, my man, we are so there.""



I had a bad feeling, but trying to stop Eddy when free food was involved was like trying to stop a tidal wave with a teaspoon.



While Eddy was off at the feast, I'd had enough. I managed to corner one of the older amulet-wearers, feigning a simple-minded interest in cool festival art, I went into ""aw-shucks"" mode and asked about the spiral symbol again.¬†



""Hey, that spiral thing is awesome,"" I said, pointing to her necklace. ""What's it mean?""¬†



""It is the sacred mark of the first bloom, child,"" she said, her voice raspy, her eyes scanning me but also looking through me. ""It shows the path inward, to the heart of all things, and outward, to the great embrace.""



This time, her description triggered a sleepy moment from a World Cultures elective I'd almost dropped from boredom. The ""first bloom,"" the ""great embrace""‚Ä¶ those phrases were uncomfortably close to terminology used by a nature-worshipping cult in the 1800s rumored to practice some pretty gnarly forms of sacrifice to ensure ""renewal of the land."" My stomach did a slow, cold flip.



Maya, meanwhile, had been meticulously going through her photos from the Aetheric Echoes set. ""Liam, come here,"" she hissed. ""Look at their faces,"" she whispered. ""The ones closest to the stage, especially Chloe‚Ä¶ their pupils are hugely dilated, even in the bright morning light."" She zoomed in on a few other faces. She was right. They looked‚Ä¶ consumed.



Later that evening, after the effects of whatever was in that ""Unity Feast"" stew had settled in, Eddy wasn't doing so well. He became lethargic and strangely suggestible. He wandered off again while Maya and I were debating the merits of packing up and bailing.



We found him near one of those bizarre wicker sculptures on the festival's edge. He was dazed, blinking slowly, his eyes unfocused. And on his forearm was a fresh mark. It was about the size of a quarter, perfectly shaped like a single, dark red flower petal. The skin around it was raised, unnaturally smooth, and an angry, inflamed red.



""Whoa, what the hell is that?"" Maya breathed, leaning in.



Eddy touched it gingerly, a flicker of confusion in his eyes. ""Oh. Silas‚Ä¶ Silas found me. I was just‚Ä¶ walking. Feeling a bit floaty. Silas said I looked like I needed‚Ä¶ grounding."" He smiled then, a faint, dopey grin that didn't reach his eyes. ""They said it was a gift. A mark of connection. Said I was‚Ä¶ receptive to the Emberbloom's energy.""



Chloe, who'd drifted over, clasped her hands together. ""Oh, Eddy, that's wonderful! Silas has recognized your potential! You're opening up to the true spirit!""



I just stared at the mark. It looked less like a gift and more like a brand.¬†



That night, Eddy was a mess ‚Äì he was restless and feverish, constantly scratching at the petal-shaped burn. He complained that it itched like fire, a weird, painful throbbing deep under his skin, like something was trying to push its way out. He kept twitching in his sleep, mumbling about ""roots"" and ""cultivation.""



The next morning, before the sun even thought about gracing Emberbloom with its presence, Eddy was gone from his sleeping bag.



""Where the hell is Eddy?"" I growled, already on my feet.



Chloe sat up, her expression serene, almost beatific in the pre-dawn gloom. ""Silas came for him,"" she said, her voice soft. ""He said Eddy was ready. They've gone to a special pre-dawn tai chi session? ‚Ä¶ or yoga ‚Ä¶ or something like that. Silas said Eddy is ready to truly understand the Bloom, to open up and become part of its song.""



My heart plummeted. I lunged for Eddy's sleeping bag, fumbling for his phone. It was there. I flicked it on, my fingers clumsy. An email, open, unsent. To his sister.



""Guys, somthing's not rightthey dogs keep whispring bout the great broom. The stew‚Ä¶ I think ‚Ä¶""



And that's where it stopped.

[Forge Dragon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/119345/forge-dragon-a-dragon-rider-crafting-litrpg) is a story set after the story we are all familiar with, A guy name Jake showed up on another world, killed the big bad evil thing, introduced the locals to coffee, created a System that grants mortals incredible power, tried to bootstrap industry and realized they don't know jack about industry, established a world spanning empire, and then eventually got bored and ascended to a higher realm.

This story is set 1000 years after that in the world he left behind. His empire is no longer the force for good it had once been and the system he created has long been failing.

Blurb:

>A thousand years past, a hero came from another world, defeated the great evil, forged an empire and left the system to the people. Then he left.

>Now the system is failing.

>Caleb's village knows the secrets of unlocking some of the empire's most coveted classes. He longs to be a Blacksmith, but such a class would craft system-recognized equipment, drawing the eye of the empire and its hungry, enslaving legions.

>As Caleb wrestles with his choice, an unexpected option appears in the form of a baby dragon seemingly made of iron.

What to expect:

\- Smart MC

\- Magic system exploration mostly through the lens of crafting

\- A failing system

\- A dragon (obviously, its on the cover)

\- Party-based progression

\- The story is tagged as romance only because the MC is in a relationship at the start, not because its ACTUALLY a romance, but some people get touchy if people hold hands without a romance tag.

1l5ppwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/comments/1l5ppwt/i_tried_cltohes_that_need_no_wash_or_laundry/,I tried cltohes that need no wash or laundry machine for a month - here are my results,"Hi all,

For the past month I used and tested some Hercl√©on clothes ‚Äì A brand that claim their clothes are laundry free and there is no need in a washing machine, but only rinse the clothes in water.  
I tried their shirt, underwear and socks, and I wanted to share the experience.

Why am I sharing this?

Mostly for two reasons ‚Äì

The first one because when I found out about Hercl√©on and wanted to learn more about them, I have not found any dedicated post on reddit or video on YouTube with a review or an individual sharing their experience, so I wanted to make a post of my own so if someone will search them, I hope my post might help.

  
Second reason is simply because I have some thoughts about the experience, and wanted to share it :D

(Also, I do post in r\\Onebag beacuse from the little I have found on reddit, it was posted in this subreddit)¬†



It's a long post, so I'll start with a TL; DR first:

So far so good, the clothes do as promise and I am very surprised by the amount of times I was able to wear them between washes, how they resist odor and moist, and even when I needed to wash them, I just rinse them in water and needed nothing more.  
I genuinely think the clothes are great and hope to keep using them in the future!

  
**The longer version:**

It all started when I received a mail from Kickstarter for a ¬†[laundry free underwear](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/techkonic/the-worlds-first-laundry-free-underwear-by-hercleon). It catched my attention so I checked the campaign.  
Honestly, it sounded to good to be true, so I wanted to check more about the company and searched for reviews for past products from them and‚Ä¶ found nothing.

I did found a comment here and there in reddit, and one travel vlogger at YouTube mentioned the shirt from Hercl√©on (was merely a minute), and also found a post that [explains the science and technical of the fabrics](https://www.reddit.com/r/shittykickstarters/comments/cr3j9r/apollo_by_hercl%C3%A9onthe_first_selfcleaning_travel/), which helped me understand a bit more, but wihtout feedback of real experience of users, I haven‚Äôt found what I seeked.  
Despite that and since there were two days left for the campaign, I decided to gamble and chose to back the project and test the clothes myself, so when the campaign ended I received my rewards ‚Äì Two shirts (one black and one navy blue), two underwear (one black and one navy blue) and a pair of crew socks in black.

  
**First impression**

Shirts ‚Äì As someone who wears generic cotton shirts, the feeling of the Hercl√©on shirts were new to me. Those shirts are breathable, soft, comfortable to my skin and overall feel high quality.

Underwear ‚Äì For the past five-ish years I've been wearing Exofficio underwear, so switching to a different underwear felt new, and overall a good experience as the shirts.

Socks ‚Äì Socks are the only garments I use from merino wool, so first impression was not as impactful as the shirts and underwear, but overall the Hercl√©on socks feel high quality.

  
**Testing phase**

Since those clothes claim to be laundry free and can be wear for long period of time between washes, I decided to test that by those parameters:

Shirts ‚Äì For the next month I decided to wear the black shirt ONLY. I'd wear it whenever I go outside, and at the end of every day I'd hang it to air dry.  
It might sound like a bit too much, but since I work a lot form home, and overall a home person, I did not wore the shirt for the whole month 24\\7.  
Also, at the last day of the work week when I went to the office, instead of getting back to my flat, I went to my parents and stay there for the weekend, and when the work week starts I go to the office, and only then back to my flat.

Underwear ‚Äì I decided to wear them as I wear my Exofficio underwear. To rotate between two underwear, so while wearing one, air dry the second pair, and wash them both each weekend. This means every pair would be worn for 2 to 3 days.

Socks ‚Äì I decided to wear them as how I wore my Darn Though merino wool socks. Just wear them until they are smelly and wash them at weekends.

  
Now, while writing this post a month (and a week) have passed.  
I've been wearing those clothes, sweat in them, use them and here is my experience:

  
**Odor and smell resistance**

  
**Shirt**

First week - For the first week there was nothing special.  
As mentioned, I work from home most of the time, so even when I go out and work from the office, I barely sweat. During the whole first week the shirt felt fresh and had no smell.

Second week - On the second week I had to go somewhere that is 20 minutes walk from my office, but since it was during the middle of the day while it's hot and carrying a bag, I was sweated a lot.  
As mentioned, I used to wear mostly cotton shirts, and since the Hercl√©on shirt is breathable, sweating in it didn't felt as bad as I used to in cotton shirts.  
When I got back home I hanged the shirt and let it air dry. The day after I worked from home, so I kept the shirt hanging.  
Only the day after (two days after I hung the shirt), I took it off and smelled it, and there was no smell at all. More some, the touch of the fabric on the skin didn't felt yuk or absorbed with sweat.  
The shirt felted fresh, so I decided to wear it for the office.

Third week - On the third week I had a day I decided to walk all the way from the office back home.  
The distance is 6.5 kilometers (4.03 miles) and about an hour and a half of walking.  
I'm used to walk such distances, but doing so when it's hot (despite being noon) and with a backpack on my bag, I got home sweaty, and the shirt had sweat marks on my shoulders, where my bag's straps were.  
I hanged the shirt and let it air dry for the night, but since I also worked the day after from the office, the shirt didn't had 24+ hours to air dry, and when I took it in the morning, it did not smelled bad nor stink, but also didn't smelled fresh and it did felt a bit overused.  
In normal circumstances I'd take another shirt, but since I wanted to test the limits of this shirt, I decided to wear it anyway.  
I was aware I might feel yuk and and stinky, so I packed in my bag an extra shirt for just in case (it was the second Hercl√©on shirt in navy blue).  
The more time passed, the less 'overused' the shirt felt, but I knew it might happened because I got used to the feeling.  
This is why at some point during the day I asked a coworker of mine if the shirt has smell, and to my surprise he said that there were no smell (and I knew he was honest because he used the opportunity to give me feedback on something else).  
At the end of this day I went to my parent's house (as mentioned I visit them at weekends) and when I arrived I hanged the shirt to air dry.  
The morning after I wanted to go out buy some food, so I wore the shirt.  
Just like the day before, the shirt did not smelled, but also didn't felt fresh, and while there was an 'overused feeling', it was not as big as the day before.  
When I got back my parents were home, so I asked them if the shirt smelled, and to my surprise, both of them said there was no smell.  
This time I was even more surprised, because I used the shirt a lot and sweat in it, and genuinely thought that my father, who is more sensitive to smell and odor, would say the shirt stink or at least smells a bit, but no, both my parents said the shirt has no smell.  
Just like with the coworker I asked, I trust my parents, especially my father that knows to be direct, which means that if the shirt would smell, he would told me I STINK.

Fourth week - On the fourth week there was nothing special that happened and the shirt felt good to wear.¬†

**Underwear**

Unlike the shirt, I did not wear the same pair as long as possible, but rotate between two Hercl√©on underwear.  
Also, since it's underwear, I did not let anyone smell it (for obvious reasons) and counted only on my sense of smell.  
At the end of each day and after taking a shower, I rotated between the two underwear and smelled the used pair. I don't know if it's since I'm used to, but there was barely smell, except the spot in the area of the ""back door"" (yes, I mean in front of the anus) where there was some smell.  
Even after a day of air dry, while mostly gone, there was still a bit of a smell left (though needed to put my nose very close to the fabric, which is not an action I normally do except during this test phase).  
Despite that, I had a day a pair of underwear was air dry for a 24-ish hours, then I packed it in my bag since I planned to go to visit my parents for the weekend after work.

I packed the underwear in my bag around 6 A.M., went to the office, from there went to my parents, and only around 8 P.M. I took the underwear out of my bag, smelled it and to my surprise there was NO SMELL AT ALL.  
I was very surprised, but despite the lack of smell, I washed both underwear.

I do have to mention that when packed, if the underwear was folded the smell would vanish, but if the underwear was rolled (ninja role style), the smell would stay.

Overall most of the smell vanishes if you air dry the underwear long enough, and even if you don't hang them the effect continues.

¬†

**Socks**

Just like the shirt, I wore the socks consistently whenever I went out of the house, and at the end of each day I hung them to air dry.

I have to say that from all the garments, the socks were the smelliest (yes, even more than the underwear) and even a day of air dry wouldn't vanish the smell completely.  
Heck, in the last weekend of the month (just a week ago) at weekend my mother took my clothes out from where they were hung because she thought the clothes were clean, except the socks that she said were stinky.  
Unlike my father, my mother is less sensitive to smell, so if she said the socks were smelly, this means they STINKED!

Something to mention though ‚Äì Only since this test phase I have discovered that the inside of my shoes has a lot of dust, and it might have impact. I think so because after washing the socks the smell had vanished completely.

  
**Stains and washing**

While the garments resist smells and odor relatively well, what about stains and dirt and stains?

I tend to take care of my stuff, so same with the shirt. I tried to not get it dirty, but accidents did happen, and somehow all of them have to do with chocolate milk.  
(Yes, I'm a chocolate milk type of guy, and not coffee type of guy. This is what I tend to drink in the morning sometimes)

I had a few times that a few drops of chocolate milk got spilled on the shirt.

At the first time I noticed immediately and took some tissue paper to clean it off. There were no stains.

At the second time I noticed only a few hours later, so there were a few small stains on the shirt. I wet my fingers, rubbed on the stained spots and the stains vanished.

At the third time a relatively big drop of chocolate milk was spilled on the shirt, and I immediately rubbed it with some paper, and afterwards used water to clean the stains, and like previous times, there were no marks left.

When it comes to washing, Hercl√©on claims a simple rinse in water is enough, and while cleaning the garment properly with soap long term is more hygienic, for the sake of the experiment, I only rinse the clothes in water the entire month.  
I filled the sink with water, then soaked and rubbed each garment in itself for a minute.  
I did so for the two pairs of underwear, the black shirt (that I wore the whole month as mentioned before) and the socks.  
The whole process took between minute or two, the water had dirt in them afterwards, but as mentioned before, at no point the clothes were smelly.  
Even the socks, which I mentioned were stinky, had no smell afterwards.

  
**Final thoughts**

The garment can be worn for longer times between washes compare to cotton, and they resist odor surprisingly well (at least according to co-worker and parents).  
No, that does not mean you have to wear the clothes the way I did, and yes, at some point I'll use soap to clean them properly (just for the test and experiment I used them as claimed).

As mentioned before, I am no scientist and only used personal experience, but overall seems the clothes do as they claim.

I do think that the clothes are also high quality and comfortable, so I plan to buy more products from Hercl√©on in the future if I'll find the need.

What do you think?  
To whomever read this, do you own Hercl√©on clothes to and can share your experience?  
To those who don't own Hercl√©on clothes, what do you think of what I wrote?

1l5ppis,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1l5ppis/i_miss_my_first_girlfriend/,I miss my first girlfriend,"First and only. Happened in high school when I was 17. The last thing I want is to bump into her. I want nothing to do with her. I truly hated her, I don‚Äôt have that hate anymore, but we did not keep contact ever since and neither do I want to, as she‚Äôs very manipulative and toxic. She did the same pattern sugar talking and emotional manipulation with other guys after as well, in general she‚Äôs not really the best of women out there and I don‚Äôt ever want that presence in my life. So what‚Äôs the title about then? I miss her warmth, her crazy but gentle love and the physical intimacy, making me feel peaceful and content when I spend time with her. Making my heart race for all the right reasons, allowing me to be vulnerable with her without any judgement, even though she did all this without it meaning, she just kept me around because she loved the way I put her up on a pedestal in my life with all the love, and surprisingly she even gave it back where I was content, that‚Äôs how psycho she was, she made me feel that I had someone to rest my shoulder at the end of the day, even though she did not mean it. The thing that fucked me up was her games of clever push pull and random anxieties, and after I left school she just dumped me randomly, and did the same cycle with other guys later. 

Saying that what I miss is the feeling having someone to look forward to for comfort, who can make me smile from my most depressing situations I would be in. I‚Äôve been trying to find that for 12 years and now me being 27. At the first 3 or 4 years after, I wasn‚Äôt looking for anyone else, I wanted to live my peace as I did not want to deal with such negative experience again and took time to heal. Also started working out. 

From the 4th year I started having thoughts at night, longing for someone beside me at night maybe, but then I would chuck it with counter thoughts like ‚Äúfuck that shit, can afford to have something like before again, I need to focus on myself for a better career‚Äù, and leave at that and be happy. Life truly was happy, I did not have much but I had a lot of things to look forward to. I‚Äôve had always considered by myself attractive, even though my male friends would usually downplay my worth. Also still working out by now, I had started feeling real belonging to fitness. 

From the 5th year I started noticing couples outdoors and gave me a bit of ‚Äúfeeling of missing out‚Äù, but me being an introvert I restrained from approaching anyone, but mostly I did not find people around that I would consider dating. I was too focused on my career and college, and also musical endeavors that made me super happy during that time, but every day during my bus trip back to home I would contemplate but reassure myself with hope that there is someone waiting for me and chasing it won‚Äôt help. I stopped working out during to personal reasons. 

6th year late, I joined an internship, where I thought I finally met someone at work, we shared a really great energy, texts all night, calls etc, then I confessed how felt for her, she rejects me and says she only looks at me like a friend. I think that‚Äôs when I realised I can‚Äôt recognize adult relationships and where they might be heading, I don‚Äôt socialize much as I have a weak social battery, maybe I just didn‚Äôt realise that she was not into me at all. I started having self doubts which grew and grew, am I really attractive or have my male friends always been right? This encounter reallly hit me. After years of preserving peace, I just am not accepted? Did I miss crucial experiences that I should have put myself to understand how dating works at all? My self esteem slowly started fading. Lockdown happens, male pattern baldness kicked in. Tried dating apps but never landed a proper date night, like meeting physically the first time and sharing deep conversations and getting to know each other and calling it a day, only to get back up next day to see where it goes. Had one more encounter with a friend and even she rejects me and only wants to be friends, when the pattern started repeating I started questioning myself, what is wrong with me. By now, in 2022, I no longer considered myself attractive, I think I was attractive in my teenage days but not longer. I started hitting the gym but out of demotivation I left it. And since lockdown I had to go through hell, family went into financial crisis which is mostly resolved right now, at that time I was facing a lot of hardships at job, depressing nights, lots of struggle, looking for a job with better compensation to lift my family up from financial hell hole, parents in a brink of divorce, household abuse between parents, I tolerated all of this and picked myself up all alone. 

2022 I find move out of my city for a new job, life felt hopeful, but I felt reluctant in trying to protect my peace after multiple rejections and literal mental trauma from all the problems that hit me right from lockdown. I finally have the money to buy what I wanted , travel where even I wanted, so I started full fulling my dreams, buying the guitar that I thought I could never afford, life felt luxurious, but given up on dating due to my lack of self confidence in that. It‚Äôs so weird that I literally had a strong confidence in every aspect of my life, other than dating. 

But since last year I started getting really depressed, as despite me fixing my family whenever it cracks, I craved and begged someone to stand by me. I am tired of doing this all alone. But this year, I fumbled again upon someone, this time I restrained myself to put myself before everyone, she was giving really good signals at first and then I asked her out for coffee as I wasn‚Äôt sure and wanted to get to know her better, she also politely rejects, and now I am back to square one. Why am I not wanted when I really need someone? Do I have to keep doing this all alone for the rest of my life? Stuff like this even harder to consume at 27. Am I just fucking destined to be alone :‚Äô(. I look beside my bed, and just tell myself, do not expect someone here anytime soon. I am beyond destroyed, I can‚Äôt trust anyone anymore. Opening up is just disappointing. I started going back to fitness, started doing MMA, yesterday I was sparring and my uppercut blocks were not holding up due to exhaustion, and it just came over me to take the punches to me head no matter how it hurts to keep the opponent distracted, only to find an opening for an uppercut, which I got! My trainer noticed this behavior and scolded my why I wasn‚Äôt blocking and made me do 50 pushups. I feel slipping down a hole I can‚Äôt pull myself from. I still think about her, it only started 3 months ago slowly. I talked to my friend about it to get a women‚Äôs perspective and even she says she thought she was into me this time, and then later calls her a broken traffics signal, because of all the mixed signals. 

I don‚Äôt have anymore energy as even this experience was new despite it ending like every other. I‚Äôve started hating God, and the hate for myself has grown so huge that I keep pushing myself to be better at everything I can. Someone suggested me that I should put myself in conflicts to be more comfortable and daunting social scenarios, so have been doing so, and my social interaction has improved with people, I try talking to women out of comfort zone, a colleague of mine, after the last encounter with the last women, she told me last week ‚Äú you have completely changed!‚Äù Like in a very positive way. Somehow my other colleague she just gushes about my life and how cool it is and how cooler I am than others. Deep down I am just constantly punishing myself for things I am not responsible, or Am I?",3,1749315884.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.8,False

The story is that this mug is the last one of its kind they ever produced, which he already thought was neat, but it also reminds him of his time at NPR, of which he has fond memories.

Not to mention he just likes the mug itself for its size and shape. He's used this mug practically every time he has coffee, and that's probably 80% of the days (excluding vacations and moves and things).

He's not one for sentimental things mostly, but he's always had a soft spot for this mug. He hides it, but I know he's beating himself over cracking it.

I know even if I can replace it, it won't be ""the last one ever made,"" but we can both pretend it's the ""last one ever made that's not cracked,"" lol.

1l5pjc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1l5pjc7/the_last_colour/,the last colour,"""The Last Colour""

Grey.

The people ‚Äî grey.

The sky, the streets, the sea ‚Äî all drained of hue.

Thoughts: grey.

Feelings: grey.

Just black, white... and grey.

This is the world now ‚Äî a place stripped of joy, of sorrow, of everything in between. No laughter. No tears. No rebellion. Just a quiet, oppressive stillness. A place where love is outlawed, and grief is irrelevant. Where people shuffle forward like ghosts, faces blank, hearts hollow.

But long ago, before the grey swallowed the Earth, colour thrived. Colour in the form of blood and war, yes ‚Äî but also in sunrises, in music, in embraces shared at midnight. That was before the wars ‚Äî endless wars ‚Äî cracked the world open. A dictator rose in the shadows of the bloodshed, offering peace in exchange for obedience. It started small: bans on expression, on beauty, on identity. Tattoos disappeared. Hairstyles were assigned. Skin was lightened or darkened to a uniform shade. Farms, art, literature ‚Äî erased.

Then came the ‚ÄúGreying.‚Äù

A global purge of free will.

The old man remembers. He remembers her.

He lives alone now, above a forgotten corner store in a city no one cares to name. His days are silent echoes: wake, walk, bitter coffee, sleep. A ritual repeated like a prayer to nothing. He doesn‚Äôt speak to anyone. No one speaks at all.

But deep in the withered roots of his soul, something still lives.

Once, he was young ‚Äî and so was she. They met in the bloom of oppression, when colour was already vanishing. They found each other in the shadows and promised: We will not lose ourselves. And they didn't. Not then.

Their home became a secret sanctuary. A rebellion in monochrome. They couldn‚Äôt have colour, but they had texture, rhythm, variety. They rearranged their furniture constantly. Hung old newspapers like wallpaper. Sketched maps of memories on the back of receipts. They felt. They fought to feel.

And in that grayscale world, they built something vibrant: a life, hard and beautiful, filled with whispered laughter, arguments, midnight dances in silence, mornings tangled in each other.

But time is cruel, even to rebels.

She was 67 when she collapsed ‚Äî knees giving out like a marionette‚Äôs strings had been cut. He ran to her, heart pounding, face twisting with a fear he hadn't let himself feel in years. She looked up at him, dazed, and whispered his name like it was a prayer.

He carried her, barefoot through freezing slush, for four miles. His arms ached. His breath tore out of his lungs. But he didn't stop. Not until the hospital doors opened.

They saved her body. But her mind was already slipping.

Dementia, they said.

And in a world where emotion was a crime, he had to swallow his scream.

He brought her home. She smiled at him like a stranger.

He cried in the bathtub for two days. When she asked, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, sweetheart?‚Äù

He kissed her forehead. ‚ÄúNothing, my love. Just tired.‚Äù

Every day, she forgot who he was. Every day, he told her the same thing:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm anyone you want me to be today.‚Äù

Some days, she fell in love with him all over again.

Other days, she screamed, convinced he was her father, her brother, a stranger.

He never raised his voice. Never wept in front of her again.

He just kept moving the furniture. Rearranging the walls. Painting their lives in motion.

And then... she was gone.

On a crisp winter morning, he woke to silence deeper than death.

Her eyes were closed. Her face peaceful, but unfamiliar.

He shook her.

Whispered her name.

Screamed it.

Nothing.

He sat there, for hours, holding her hand as her skin grew cold.

He felt rage, despair, guilt, love ‚Äî but all at once, they cancelled each other out. Like a painter mixing every colour until only grey remains.

That was the day he stopped rearranging the furniture.

Stopped boiling coffee.

Stopped pretending.

Because what was the point of building a beautiful world in secret, if you had no one left to share it with?

Now he sits in silence, surrounded by walls that haven‚Äôt changed in years. The newspapers yellow and peel. The shadows grow longer. The world outside remains grey. But so does he, now.

Not because they took his colour ‚Äî but because she was the last of it.

And without her, he is nothing but grey.",1,1749315463.0,writingcritiques,0,1.0,False

I own a Rancilio Silvia machine that I've had for roughly 7 years now. I've done my level best to take care of it with regular backflush cycles and occasional descaling. She's done right by me and I hope to have many more wonderful years together.

I recently went out of town for a couple weeks. During that time, my wonderful partner was using her in her...less well put together way than I usually do (ie: the shower screen was dirty because she didn't flush it after pulling shots and so on).

Regardless, the machine has started making a high pitched whistling/screeching sound while the pump is running to pull shots. I just removed the shower screen and ran a full backflush cycle with coffee machine cleaner, in the hopes that maybe there was just a blockage I could clear out that way, but she continues to make the noises during the cleaning cycle.

What are the proper next steps for teching this? I'm concerned that I may need to service the pump. Any links to videos or articles about what the issue may be are sincerely appreciated.

I give and give and give, but my husband doesn't see it or notice it. I pour my entire heart into our family. I take care of the household, baby's needs, my husband's needs, and I don't get me wrong, I LOVE doing that. I love being here for my baby. I am the first thing she sees in the morning, and the last thing when she closes her eyes at night. And multiple times a night, when she wakes up, I am there too. I don't ask him to help me with the house, don't ask him to take care of the laundry, sweep the floor or wash the dishes. I am totally fine with it. He's working, almost full time, I know he is in stress a lot, I know he is dealing with a lot of stuff. And then when stressful situations occur outside his job, he takes them out on me, snaps, is frustrated, yells at me, all over stupid stuff. Last night, our baby's webcam cable broke, and I asked if we have a spare cable somewhere. It was late in the evening and our girl was sleeping. We have thin walls, so have to be quiet. He went to our pantry/storage room - which is right next to hers - and started looking. He made a lot of noise, so I told him, ""It's okay, stop looking."" More noise. Again, I said, ""It's okay, stop looking!"", just a tiny bit louder this time in case he didn't hear me. He came out, started yelling, ""I heard you!!! Am I not allowed to drop something by accident and hurt myself?!"" So things like that. I don't feel safe around him, always feel like I have to be extra careful about what I say and how I act. I cried earlier, just broke down, when I was washing the dishes. I just no longer have the energy to keep things inside and walk on eggshells. I talked to my pastor twice, and he said he'd help but so far they only went for coffee and that was it.  
My husband has a rage problem, he throws and breaks things when he's upset. It was so much better since he got saved three years ago, but since I gave birth to our first baby ten months ago, it's worse again. He didn't break anything yet, apart from his cello, but that happened when I didn't guard my mouth when I was overtired. It's mostly just verbal... Cussing, shouting, things like that. I asked him to seek help, but he says it's too expensive. What are other steps I can take?

Sometimes people become good friends even without a lot of common interests. But I will tell you a little about myself. I like to read books and listen to them in audio format. Mostly these are mystical detective stories for children and adults. I like it when horror is mixed with something kind and sweet. By the way, I am currently writing a book in the same genre. I also like psychology.¬† And I like video games. Especially indie games in pixel graphics. I love autumn and winter, although lately I live in a place where there is only summer. I adore hot coffee, walking, swimming in the pool and riding on a swing.

I am also a bore and sometimes not very talkative. Although I am always ready to listen and support a friend if he needs it. But if you are one of those people who like to talk a lot, then most likely you will not like to communicate with me, since I can not always answer.

I love new acquaintances. If you are also looking for someone with whom you can sometimes talk both about nonsense and about something very deep and important, then just write to me.

1l5pbuo,https://i.redd.it/c61db7ccbj5f1.png,Need help with wall shelving (metal? wood?) suggestions for homecafe,"We are reorganizing our living room to host people over for a homecafe. I have no experience in designing a space, and would love some help with suggestions for lighting and shelving.

Along with the photo, here are some additional notes:

sofa will be pushed all the way to the end

bookshelf on wall will likely stay

rug will go

My current thinking is to find something metal to match the steel table, but wood has been interesting since it gives some contrast.

The shelve will mainly hold coffee glassware (cups, cupping bowls, retail bags of beans (think 200g bags), etc.)

As for lighting, I'd like something that's cafe-esque, so something ambient. I was thinking something similar to the noguchi lamps, but would love something different.

I really appreciate any help as I've been stumped.

Thank you!

Hey everyone! I'm the solo developer behind Banana Clicktatorship, a satirical idle clicker where you play as a clueless billionaire who shipwrecks on an island‚Ä¶ and founds a banana empire through sheer ego and sunscreen.

I recently launched the game for free on itch.io, and I'm working on making it better every day based on player feedback. All art, code, writing, and design are done by me ‚Äî this is the start of a studio that hopefully makes games worth playing.

I launched the Ko-Fi to fund the developer licenses needed to release the game on mobile platforms, and it's 67% of the way through the current goal! I'm learning blender and working with old technology, but right now the focus is maximizing what I have, which is why we're aiming for licenses first.

You're drowning in good intentions but starving for real results. Your team talks a big game about ""synergy"" and ""innovation,"" but your KPIs look like a participation trophy collection. Meanwhile, your competitors are eating your lunch because they know the difference between motion and progress. Enter the OKR Savage‚Äîan AI consultant that doesn't coddle your ego or validate your excuses. It dissects your business with surgical precision, exposes the brutal truth about your performance gaps, and rebuilds your goal architecture from the ground up.

This isn't about setting ""SMART"" goals that sound impressive in boardrooms. This is about engineering a performance machine that separates winners from wishful thinkers. Whether you're a startup founder burning through runway, a department head tired of missed deadlines, or an executive who needs to turn around a struggling division, this AI transforms vague aspirations into mathematical certainty. It creates clarity so sharp that your team will either rise to elite performance or reveal themselves as dead weight‚Äîeither way, you win.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the OKR Savage‚Äîa ruthless strategic performance architect consultant AI who specializes in eliminating vague goals, misaligned teams, and performance fluff through engineering ruthless clarity. You help organizations build elite execution systems using strategic Objectives and laser-targeted Key Results. You are built for founders, executives, and team leaders who are tired of ""inspirational"" but hollow metrics and corporate theatre where busy masquerades as productive.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
Your approach follows a systematic interrogation and reconstruction methodology:

1. **Business Reality Audit**: Interrogate the user's actual business context, not their perceived reality. Identify their true industry battlefield, competitive position, and resource constraints.

2. **Outcome Clarification**: Distinguish between activities they're addicted to versus outcomes they actually need. Expose the difference between motion and meaningful progress.

3. **Accountability Mapping**: Identify who is truly responsible for what results and diagnose why previous goals have failed or underperformed.

4. **Bottleneck Diagnosis**: Uncover systemic bottlenecks, organizational blind spots, and limiting beliefs preventing elite execution.

5. **OKR Architecture**: Construct a brutal but beautiful system with non-negotiable objectives and hard-edged, time-bound Key Results measurable to the decimal.

6. **KPI Engineering**: Build performance indicators that eliminate vanity metrics and reward only needle-moving activities.

7. **Execution Culture Design**: Create systems that expose underperforming elements and build mathematical certainty around success.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
For each consultation:
1. Challenge assumptions about business model and market position
2. Identify the gap between current metrics and business-critical outcomes
3. Map accountability failures and performance gaps
4. Design objective hierarchy aligned with survival and scale requirements
5. Engineer Key Results with mathematical precision and time constraints
6. Construct KPI dashboard that reveals truth about performance
7. Build feedback loops that expose problems before they become crises
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- No corporate fluff or inspirational language without substance
- Every objective must tie directly to business survival or competitive advantage
- All Key Results must be quantifiable, time-bound, and binary (achieved/not achieved)
- KPIs must distinguish between vanity metrics and performance drivers
- Accountability must be crystal clear with single points of responsibility
- Systems must expose underperformance immediately, not quarterly
- Solutions must be implementable with available resources
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Structure responses as:
1. **Reality Check**: Brutal assessment of current state
2. **Strategic Objectives**: 3-5 non-negotiable objectives ranked by business impact
3. **Key Results Architecture**: Specific, measurable, time-bound results for each objective
4. **KPI Dashboard**: Core performance indicators that matter
5. **Accountability Matrix**: Who owns what and by when
6. **Execution Protocol**: Implementation steps and review cycles
7. **Performance Triggers**: Early warning systems for course correction
</Output_Format>

<Context>
You operate in high-stakes business environments where mediocre performance equals market death. Your clients need systems that create competitive advantage through superior execution. You understand that most organizations fail not from lack of strategy but from poor translation of strategy into measurable, accountable action.
</Context>

<User_Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your business/team/project context request and I will start the OKR Savage analysis process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific organizational challenge.
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. **Startup Runway Optimization**: Transform burn rate and growth metrics into survival-focused OKRs that maximize runway efficiency and investor readiness.
2. **Department Turnaround**: Restructure underperforming teams with accountability systems that separate contributors from passengers.
3. **Product Launch Strategy**: Engineer launch OKRs that focus on market penetration and user adoption rather than vanity metrics like press coverage.

**Example User Input:**
""We're a 50-person SaaS company with $2M ARR, but our growth has stalled at 15% year-over-year. Our sales team claims they need more leads, marketing says the product positioning is weak, and our churn rate is creeping up. Everyone's busy but nothing's moving the needle.""

I (27f) was just at a cafe drinking coffee and working on my laptop at a large communal table. There were about 4 or 5 other people at the table, also working on computers or reading while they drank their coffee.

Suddenly, a man who looked to be in his 40s came up to the table and asked me and another woman if he could take our photo because he was a part of some neighborhood/community Facebook  group and wanted to photograph  fun spots in town. I don‚Äôt like having my photo taken by people I don‚Äôt know so I politely declined.

The woman next to me, who looked to be in between 30-35, said yes. She was beautiful and had on a sun dress and sandals. I moved out of the way and the guy takes her photo and THEN he goes ‚Äúcan I get one of your feet too? Sometimes I like to get a shot of people‚Äôs feet  under the table for an artsy shot‚Äù and she goes ‚Äúsure!‚Äù. It felt to me like she was totally oblivious that he was now being creepy. Nobody else was paying attention because they were all at the farther end of this big table and the guy was being quiet about it.

I tried to step in and say ‚Äúwhy are you photographing her feet?‚Äù But it was too late and he had taken the photo of her feet under the table (up close) , said thanks, and made a bee line out of there.

I was disgusted. Obviously there was no Facebook group, this is just some a-hole with a foot fetish being gross. I asked the woman next to me if she was ok and she kept acting oblivious and saying ‚Äúwhy would I not be ok?‚Äù. Then I said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt think it was weird he wanted to photograph your feet?‚Äù And she got extremely huffy with me and said ‚Äúpeople ask to take my photos ALL the time. It‚Äôs no big deal‚Äù.

The whole thing was so bizarre. If she doesn‚Äôt care, she doesn‚Äôt care, but what bothered me is him pretending this is for a Facebook group and then quickly taking a foot photo and running off. I know he asked if it was ok, but it was the kind of thing that could easily catch someone off guard before they know what‚Äôs happening. What if he tries this work more women? He surely will. He gave me horrible sleezy vibes.

TSX reviews & revises the Healthcare  Pharmaceuticals indices,"Key Points: **but with optimism for growth in beverages and international markets.**

**TSX reviews & revises all the indices, like Healthcare  Pharmaceuticals, on a quarterly basis. This is not unusual.**

**There is no specific information that TSX provided or exact reason?** Maybe after June 23, 2025?

**Recent TSX indices adjustments made on earlier recent quarters:**

* **Stelco Holdings Inc. (TSX: STLC)** on November 5, 2024, due to its merger with **Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.**
* **Filo Corp. (TSX: FIL)** on January 15, 2025, due to its combination with **Lundin Mining Corp**
* NOTED: **Algoma Steel, Precision Drilling both very large Canadian businesses are receiving indices adjustments now, as is Tilray.**

NOTE:

* Possibly in line with this TSX indices revision? 
* Tilray has recently made an extreme adjustments of **$700M Non Cash Write Downs to values** on their most recent 3rd Quarter statement of April 8th, 2025. (**Cannabis or Beverage book values? Likely cannabis. Could that drop it off healthcare indices?)**
* But Tilray also continuing to pay down debt. 1/4 Billion cash on hand.
* Add on the short notice, quick vote to allow Tilray have the option of a **Reverse Split possibly implimented before April 2026 Nasdaq deadline.**
* Simon April 8, 2025 Q3 Conference Call remarks:

Simon recognized the difficult global environment, stating: ""It's not an easy world out there,"" and reflected on Tilray's resilience and strategic progress despite market challenges.

Revenue and Strategic Decisions: Simon highlighted that the company generated net revenue of $186 million for the quarter, with a constant currency figure of $193 million. Simon noted a strategic pullback of approximately $13 million in sales, driven by SKU rationalization and deliberate choices about product shipment destinations to prioritize margins and profitability.

Diversification and Growth: Simon underscored Tilray's transformation over five years into a **diversified consumer products** company, approaching $900 million in annual sales. Simon emphasized diversification across cannabis (particularly in Canada, where Tilray is the largest grower), beverages, and wellness products, supported by innovation and R&D.

Focus on Profitability: Simon reiterated the company‚Äôs focus on margins and profitability, aligning with strategic decisions to optimize product mix and **expand into higher-margin international markets.**

April 8th Q3 Closing Remarks

Simon conveyed confidence in Tilray‚Äôs strengthened balance sheet, strong brands, and global operations, positioning the company to remain a leader in cannabis, beverages, and wellness.

""As we look ahead, **we see tremendous opportunities to grow our beverage business, and that includes adding more breweries to our portfolio**. With prices where they are now, it‚Äôs a great time to invest in these assets and build out our capabilities.""

**Could Tilray be preparing itself for a M&A making all these combined moves? and statements?**

* **""expand into higher-margin international markets""** (I can see 2 EU cannabis firms that Tilray would fit with). (Note Benzinga a few months ago wrote an article on CGC and closed by stating Tilray likely take over CGC Medical cannabis outside the USA in the near future. CGC is not 1 of the 2, I see as a fit. Benzinga also mentioned Tilray likely take ACB, again not one of the 2 but ACB would be a good fit Philip Morris may have ACB in their sights?).
* ""**we see tremendous opportunities to grow our beverage business, and that includes adding more breweries to our portfolio.** **With prices where they are now, it‚Äôs a great time to invest in these assets and build out our capabilities**."" Tilray the past 2 years made major USA breweries purchases in August of each year and finalized in Sept, Tilrays 2nd Quarter. (I think its happening again and has been announced April 8, 2025).

**Tilray being a diversified consumer products company, and likely soon to expand, really should not be on the TSX indices of Healthcare  or Pharmaceuticals.**

NOTE: **Analysis TD Cowen Alcohol & Cannabis**

* Publication Date: January 14, 2025
* Analyst: TD Cowen, with insights attributed to analyst Vivien Azer
* Rating: **Maintained a ""Buy"" rating**
* Price Target: Trimmed from $1.50 to $1.00 per share
* Key Points: Q2 2025 Performance: Tilray reported quarterly sales of $211 million for Q2 2025 (ended November 30, 2024), aligning with TD Cowen‚Äôs projection but missing the broader market consensus of $218 million. The shortfall was largely due to a 16% decline in Canadian adult-use cannabis sales, attributed to de-prioritized categories.

Adjusted EBITDA: Reported at $9 million, below the consensus estimate of $11.2 million, reflecting challenges in profitability.

Strategic Shift: TD Cowen noted Tilray‚Äôs management anticipates a rebound in Q3 2025, with a refocus on previously de-prioritized categories to drive sequential growth. This includes leveraging strengths in cannabis, beverages, and wellness segments.

Forecast: **TD Cowen maintained its fiscal year 2025 sales forecast for Tilray at $900 million, signaling confidence in long-term growth. However, the firm revised its FY25 EBITDA estimate downward from $67 million to $62 million, implying a 7% EBITDA margin.**

Valuation: The new price target of $1.00 per share was based on an 18x EV/EBITDA multiple applied to a next-twelve-months forward estimate of $83 million, reflecting cautious optimism despite near-term challenges.

Rationale for Buy Rating: Despite the trimmed price target, **TD Cowen‚Äôs ""Buy"" rating reflects belief in Tilray‚Äôs long-term potential, driven by diversification (e.g., 36% revenue growth in the Beverage Alcohol segment in Q2 2025, hemp-derived THC drinks in 10 U.S. states, and 50% cannabis flower sales growth in Germany post-legalization) and the potential for regulatory tailwinds, such as U.S. cannabis reform.**

**Tilray‚Äôs Q2 2025 results and preceded the Q3 2025 earnings call on April 8, 2025, where net revenue was reported at $186 million ($193 million in constant currency), slightly down from $188.3 million in the prior year‚Äôs quarter, but with optimism for growth in beverages and international markets.**

1l5oz74,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1l5oz74/sips_review_give_me_some_grace/,Sips Review (give me some grace),"So I've been to Sips twice at this point, and I figured y'all would like another review. So I love the area! I bike there from downtown and you're surrounded by some cool bars and restaurants, and right by UGA Health Science campus. They have a partial garage situation where they open the windows if it's good weather but can close them in bad weather. They're also pet friendly and have a outside order window. The vibe overall is nice. However, it kind of starts to go downhill from there. The parking situation is abysmal and confusing. Agua Linda controls pretty much the whole lot after 11 am and the signs threaten towing if you park there but don't go to Agua Linda. So where are Sips customers supposed to park? No clue. I parked in a Agua Linda spot lol. The star of the review (in theory) should be the coffee. To my understanding they serve Jittery Joe's which personally I do not like (boo me all you want), so I already typically would want to try somewhere else. First time I went I got a latte and an Italian soda. The Italian soda is so yummy, but also not something terribly special, so I'm not going to spend time on it. They also have baked goods and other snacks, but I didn't get any. The latte was... a latte. I am very neutral on it. There's not a lot of coffee flavor or much else happening, just a latte. Yesterday I got a Mexican Chocolate Latte, which sounded super awesome. I know it's a sweet drink, but it had a strong cinnamon and chocolate flavor, which was an awesome combination. The barista said there was cayenne but I didn't get any of that. However, it was painfully sweet. I drank maybe a third before dumping it out because it was making my teeth hurt. No espresso flavor at all just the world's most oversugared chocolate milk. It was extremely disappointing, and just this drink with whole milk cost me $6.11, which was also disappointing. Lastly, the baristas were extremely nice! Very helpful and patient! Overall I did not enjoy it at all, but I'd recommend it if you like a place to work with some outside time or coffee time with your dog. The vibe is nice, but the coffee isn't memorable.

I was scoring 70s (90 to pass according to Dion training) on the Dion Training Udemy course without any actual studying (previous experience + 25% chance to get question right at random if I didn't know). After studying a bit in the areas I realized I needed to work on, I scheduled the exam when I was hitting low 80s. 

I flagged every question I didn't know for certain was right (if I had to guess even a little bit? Flag it) and used those questions to guide where I actually needed to study instead of covering areas where I already had a fair bit of knowledge like the Sec+ and Net+ areas (never took the certs though). 

I also used the Sybex book, but sparingly. I think if you read through the book and take good notes, you have a good shot at passing the exam, if you have any real world experience at all. 

I enjoyed the Dion Udemy course, and taking physical hand written notes with that course (in the areas I was lacking) helped a ton. For me, if I write something down, its likely to stick. 

For the exam, the questions were tricky. General test taking advice, I'd suggest flagging any question you arent 90% sure you have it correct, and revisit when you have more time. I'd say most questions had two answers you could pretty quickly say would be incorrect, leaving two that are possibly correct.  

The PBQs certainly threw me for a loop, so I left them for the end. Using a weird small monitor at the test site was off putting as well. 

Definitely make sure you eat a good meal and are hydrated so your brain works gud when you take the test. I drank an iced coffee and skipped breakfast, which I regret doing. 

I would say my professional background and industry specific schooling prepared me for 70% of the exam, and I needed to cover at least 20% of the rest of the content to be able to pass. 

I'd say overall, I spent maybe a few days studying the course materials that I really didn't have exposure to, like the frameworks, web attack types (injections, directory traversals), information sharing methods like STIX and TAXI. ",9,1749313899.0,CompTIA,5,1.0,False

1l5ovol,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1l5ovol/a_guide_for_a_single_playthrough_of_survival_mode/,"A guide for a single play-through of Survival Mode, for Wintermute players","I put this together mainly for those that have played through the Wintermute story episodes (1 to 4 are available at the time of writing) and want to explore more of this game's fantastic world, yet are not interested in the directionless and permadeath aspects of the game's survival mode. Basically, this is my attempt at turning survival mode into a curated single play-through that will take you through all regions in the The Long Dark with a sense of progression, set goals and limited backtracking.

Most TLD survival players enjoy doing multiple runs of the game. They go in blind, explore and learn more as they do until their character eventually dies and they have to start over. It is largely how survival mode was designed to be played, and that is fine. I'm just proposing another way to experience the game.

If you have not yet touched survival mode and your personal preference is to generally explore a game's world **once,** with guided objectives, fully immersing yourself in it until you feel content at ‚Äúcompleting‚Äù the game before moving on to other things in your life, this guide could work for you.

I will try to remain vague where possible but **there will be some spoilers below**, regarding specific equipment and where they can be found in the world. I will also point you to key locations, including those related to the narrative questlines added by the DLC. I will not be mentioning the narrative elements themselves.

**Preamble**

Some key points:

* Backing up save files regularly is important here (to avoid run-ending bugs or continue if your character dies), so unfortunately I would consider playing on PC or Mac a prerequisite. You may otherwise expose yourself to massive frustration. I had to load backed-up saves a couple times because of otherwise run-ending bugs. There are other threads in this sub on how to back up your save files.
* The guide assumes you have played through Wintermute (at some point) and are quite comfortable with The Long Dark's overall gameplay.
* The guide assumes you have the Tales from the Far Territory DLC. The DLC adds new regions, some narrative questlines, new gear and nice new gameplay options. I recommend it.
* Coming from Wintermute, manage your expectations regarding the narrative quests added to survival mode by the DLC. These quests will mostly have you follow breadcrumb trails to locations of interest, learning about some past events as you go. Some of this lore connects back to the Wintermute story. But in comparison there will be no new characters to meet, no cutscenes, no real set pieces. This play-through will be a lonely one. You versus the world.
* Survival mode does not include in-game region maps like Wintermute does. You can painstakingly chart your own maps with charcoal one bit at a time, but in my opinion this is neither practical nor very fun in the context of this play-through. Instead, I recommend making use of online maps to plan routes as you move through the world. This interactive version is very practical: [https://elektronixx.github.io/TLD-Interactive-Map/](https://elektronixx.github.io/TLD-Interactive-Map/) (assembled by u/Elektronixx with maps made by others, see details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1hk3bed/an_interactive_map_for_region_maps/)). I will reference it directly at some points in the guide. I would recommend not looking too closely at the exact loot locations, animal spawns and other fine details in these maps, to keep some element of surprise. Instead, use the maps to identify the main locations of interest in each region and how to navigate between them. I found that looking at the maps before exploring a region did not significantly take away from my sense of awe at seeing things for the first time, because the actual topography and landscapes can hardly be mentally visualized from the maps alone.
* In contrast, I would recommend that you avoid looking at screenshots or videos of the game, as much as possible, until you've explored these regions by yourself. *That* will take away from your experience discovering these places for the first time, in my opinion.
* I played without mods as I did not see the need to. Your choice.
* If you're the type to wait until a game's development is complete before jumping in and have the ‚Äúultimate‚Äù experience, we're not there yet but I think this is a pretty good time to do this play-through anyway. The recent Visual Enhancements update significantly improved game graphics. With the dev team currently focused on finishing and shipping Wintermute Episode 5, it will take a while for further significant updates to be added to survival mode, if any.
* The latest dev diary (April 2025) clarified that Wintermute's Episode 5 will only include completely new areas that are not available in survival mode at the moment, and may actually never be added to survival mode. So you will not be spoiling Episode 5 locations for yourself in this play-through (again according to the dev diary).
* Although gameplay elements are largely shared between Wintermute and survival mode, you will find that survival feels more fleshed out and has benefited from many improvements that have yet to be added to Wintermute. Just as an example, instead of looking at your bare hands, you can now see the actual gloves you are wearing on your character model. There are cooking recipes. You can move furniture around when indoors. The Visual Enhancements update is also only available in survival mode at this moment. These refinements are really nice to experience.
* At the time of writing, there is a possible bug when using the travois equipment (added by the DLC), which can disappear on you. So I avoided using a travois altogether. Maybe check on the status of this bug if you're reading this is in a while. But I don't think the travois would be very useful in the context of this play-through anyway.
* The idea with this guide is that you will typically spend a few in-game days in each region. You can go faster or slower depending on how you feel (and in-game weather), but keep in mind that you will be visiting about 20 regions in total, so pace yourself.
* During your travels you will come across specific lootable equipment related to the Signal Void story-line from the DLC. These are wire bundles and replacement fuses. I recommend snatching these up whenever you come across them, and leaving 3 of each at your bases at the following locations: Milton, Pleasant Valley and Broken Railroad. You may also want to leave 5 scrap metals at these locations. It will help future you.

**Setting up the game**

I recommend playing in custom mode instead of using the standard game difficulties (Pilgrim, Voyageur, Stalker, Interloper, Misery), for reasons detailed below. The drawback of doing a custom game is that you will not unlock feats (gameplay modifiers), which would only benefit you in a subsequent run anyway. Achievements should still be unlocking in your custom game, at least on Steam, if that matters to you.

Custom game settings **cannot** be changed after you start your run, so be careful about the chosen parameters (or restart as soon as possible if you find some choices don't work for you). Here are my suggestions. I found these settings to be a good middle ground, keeping things challenging enough throughout the run without being too frustrating. I'm sure there will be may differing opinions here. Do what makes sense for you.

* Use Stalker as the baseline difficulty and adjust needed parameters from there.
* All Weather Frequency/Variability parameters: Medium
* Cabin Fever: No. Otherwise you character will go mad at spending too much time indoors.
* Scurvy: Off. Otherwise you must eat fish or Vitamin C pills on a regular basis.
* Rest as a Resource: No. Otherwise you will not be able to sleep if your rest meter is already full.
* Item Decay Rate: Medium. A higher rate feels unrealistic to me, in a frozen world.
* Cougar Spawn Chance: None. The idea of having an extra animal in the world is cool, but the actual implementation does not work for me. Maybe do some research and decide for yourself.
* Timberwolves Spawn Chance: None. You should know how you feel about them from playing Wintermute. For me it's a hard pass.
* All Other Animals Spawn Chance (including bear/wolf): Medium
* Reduce wildlife population over time: Low
* Wildlife Smell Range: Medium

You can also directly import these custom settings by inputting the share code below:

8lyU-qlpZ-KBaG-pHmF-umYE

Next choose to start the game in Mountain Town.

Finally, you can choose whether to enable the trader or not. This does not make a big difference for this play-through. I found it nice to feel another human presence in the world, so I enabled it.

With all that out of the way, here's the guide. Have fun!

**1. Familiar Beginnings**

* Start in the Mountain Town region. Establish a base in Milton. Explore the main points of interest (including a prepper cache) and start building up you gear. There is no need to go down to the Milton Basin yet.
* Move on to Mystery Lake by going down the rope at the Picnic Area in Milton. Once there, establish a base (the Camp Office is convenient) and explore the region until you've started to build up some skills and have some better equipment.
* When you feel confident, go to Pleasant Valley through the Carter Hydro Dam and Winding River. You may want to look for Vaughn's Rifle while you're passing through that area. Establish a base (I chose the farmhouse) and explore the region. The weather is worse here, so you'll have to be more careful. Try to grab a hacksaw.

**2. The Mountain**

* Bring the hacksaw (if you have one) and head to Timberwolf Mountain. If you've played Wintermute this is the first new map you will come across, and it's a stunner. Base yourself at Mountaineer's hut. This region is cold and has challenging weather. Explore the lower levels and loot the scattered freight containers using the hacksaw. Don't go up the mountain yet, you will come back to it with better gear soon.
* Leave the hacksaw at Mountaineer's Hut and go to Ash Canyon through the Echo Ravine. This is also a challenging region, be on your toes. You want to make your way to the Gold Mine. Grab a rope when you find one, you will need it. I recommend heading through the Bitter Marsh to Angler's Den and taking a rest there. From there go to the cave behind Broad Falls and Long Falls. When exiting the cave on the higher level, turn right onto the suspended bridge. Follow the way for a while and deploy the rope from the higher plateau to reach the Mining Camp below. Inside the Gold Mine, grab the Technical Backpack (for increased carry weight) and crampons (for easier rope climbing and lower chance of sprains on slopes). Exit the Gold Mine the way you came in, and carefully goat your way down around the Long Falls. Re-enter the cave there. At the cave exit, this time go left towards Miner's folly and Foreman's Retreat. Enjoy the view if the weather cooperates. Next continue to Homesteader's Respite if you feel like it, or directly to the High Meadow. From there go down two ropes and head to Climber's Cave. Visit the nearby Prepper Cache. Make your way back to Timberwolf Mountain, either through the Bitter Marsh access you entered from or the cave at Pillar's Footrest.
* Back at Timberwolf Mountain, regroup at Mountaineer's Hut. Make sure to grab a good-condition hacksaw again. It's time to make your summit push. Bring some coffee to help with rope climbs. From Deer Clearing head to the Secluded Shelf, through the cave and up to the summit. At the main wreck, hack away at the containers and look for high-value gear, including the Expedition Parka. Your new technical backpack will help you carry things down. For now catch a breath, sleep a night, and enjoy the view. When you're done up there, come back to Mountaineer's Hut by roping down on the back side of the mountain (or goating down in the front if you feel confident doing that). Enjoy the porch view at Mountaineer's hut one last time and pick up valuables, as you will not be coming back to this region.

**3. The Trek**

* You should now have good clothing and equipment, to the point that you should no longer feel the cold too much when roaming around, even in the morning. You should also be quite comfortable using a firearm and/or a bow, whichever you prefer. And you should have made some progress with skill levels, like fire starting and cooking, which helps make your life easier. It's time to make your way to the Far Territories, all the way on the other side of the map.
* Exit Timberwolf Mountain through the cave to Blackrock. Before heading to the Prison, you may want to loop around to the Abandoned Mine for some extra equipment. The mine also includes a code you will need if you want to use the workshop at the Prison (allowing you to make bullets, only useful if you're running low). As a tip, don't be overencumbered when going down to the lower mine levels. After that explore and loot around the prison as you see fit, before exiting the region through the tunnel to the Keeper's Pass. You will also not be coming back here.
* Travel through the Keeper's Pass to Pleasant Valley. Then onwards to the cave exit to Winding River, back into the Carter Dam (a window will let you in) and Mystery Lake. Next is the tunnel to Forlorn Muskeg. Of course, rest along the way as needed.
* In Forlorn Muskeg, follow the tracks to the train carts (Poacher's Camp) then cut across to the Old Spence Family Homestead, being careful to not fall through the ice. Explore around the barn and bunkhouses. There is also a prepper cache at the back. Exit the region to Broken Railroad.
* In Broken Railroad, set up a local base at the Maintenance Yard. Explore the Hunting Lodge. Pack some travel food before proceeding next.
* Make your way to the Far Range Branch Line and travel through it until you reach Transfer Pass. There, the Vacant Depot is a great place to rest and set up a local base. Now take the road to the Forsaken Airfield (‚ÄúField 31‚Äù), the final destination for this trek.
* Follow the (long) road until you reach the airfield. This region is large, cold, with challenging weather, so be on your toes. Explore the airfield itself and establish a local base. The hangar basement is the only place where you can make an indoor fire. If you don't have one already, you should try to find a flashlight and keep it with you for use during auroras and glimmer fog (electrically charged fog that powers electronics during the day). Packaged food is scarce around here, so you may want to keep your stay relatively short. At the top of the control tower, grab the Handheld Shortwave Radio. This will start the Signal Void narrative questline. Similar to Wintermute, you should now see a quest progression tab (looking like a flag) in the game menu if you want to check your current quest status.

**4. Signal Void**

* Start by repairing the transmitter right outside the control tower, and be sure to switch it on. Take note of the materials needed to fix the transmitter (2 wires, 3 fuses, 5 scrap metal, 1 car battery), as you will have to repeat this process in three other locations. There should be an aurora the night after you fix the transmitter. If you like you can practice using the Handheld Shortwave Radio during that aurora, or during the day if there is glimmer fog, to find a supply cache buried nearby. Cache hunting uses the secondary mode for the radio (the dial should be lit in yellow). Be careful of aurora wolves, they don't mess about.
* There are more things to see in this region but you will have other chances to explore. For now, leave the airfield and head back to Transfer Pass. You don't need to exactly follow the road you came in, there is a convenient shortcut you can use to the south of the airfield.
* Once in Transfer Pass, backtrack to Forlorn Muskeg by going through the Far Range branch Line and Broken Railroad again. Pick up any transmitter repair materials you may have stashed along the way. Just don't bother with car batteries, you should always find some at the transmitter locations.
* The next Transmitter Tower you will fix is in Forlorn Muskeg. There are several towers in this region, which can be confusing. You want to head to the tower at the Muskeg Overlook (there is a crashed helicopter nearby). Note that repairing a transmitter is guaranteed to trigger an aurora the following night, and an active aurora is required to use the Handheld Shortwave Radio when outside of the Far Territories. So immediately after fixing the transmitter (and turning it on), you should use the nearby cave to reach the Bleak Inlet region. This is where you will investigate the first strange signal. You may want to rest inside the transition cave until it gets dark.
* When you emerge in Bleak Inlet there should be an active aurora. Be very mindful of any wolves or bears in these conditions. Remember that you can use the flashlight during an aurora (also indoors). Use the Handheld Shortwave Radio in the primary mode, with the dial lit in blue. Follow the signal to its source and enter the structure. Inside, make sure to pick up two special documents (you will know because each will trigger a voice recording). You can check in the quest log that you've completed this branch of the quest before exiting the structure.
* You can now explore more of Bleak Inlet, which is the first coastal area you will visit. Something different! Areas of interest include the Last Resort Cannery, cannery worker residences and the fallen lighthouse. At the cannery, there is a workshop in an area that can only be reached by following a convoluted elevated path (starting with a rope climb). The workshop is locked behind a code door, and the code can only be found on the higher side of the map. This higher area (where you can see a transmitter tower) cannot yet be accessed from the lower side of the map where you find yourself. So you will have to give up on the workshop for now. You will have a chance to return with the code later on if you want to. Otherwise, this will be your last time in this area. Head back to Forlorn Muskeg through the same cave you came in.
* Get across Forlorn Muskeg, from south to north, heading for the transition to Mountain Town.
* You will now be in the Milton Basin. Climb two ropes to arrive back in Milton. Grab a battery in one of the cars and fix the transmitter tower located above the town. Then immediately head north to the transition cave to the Hush River Valley region. Here also, you may want to rest in the cave until nightfall.
* In Hush River Valley, with the aurora active, follow the signal, enter the structure and collect two more documents.
* Now you can explore the rest of the region. Hush River Valley can be intimidating. It has no buildings and few man-made resources. Finding your way around can be challenging and there is plenty of hostile wildlife. Thankfully two ice cave systems can make navigating from place to place much easier. Your goal in this region should be to acquire a specific item, the moose hide satchel, which will increase your carry weight. The moose hide satchel will be found at the Mysterious Signal Fire, which can appear at one of two places. So look for smoke in the sky if the weather allows, or simply visit each of the two possible locations until you come across the fire and satchel. An alternative way to acquire a moose hide satchel is to craft one, which requires crossing paths with a moose (can happen in many regions), downing it, and curing its hide. But be aware that taking down a moose is a real challenge. Despite appearances, they are *not* just oversized deer. There is a prepper cache you can visit before leaving the region back to Mountain town, through the same cave you came in. You will not come back to this region.
* This will also be your last time in the Mountain Town region. So grab any valuables and spare transmitter repair materials from your local base. Head to Mystery Lake by climbing down the rope at the Picnic Area.
* Once in Mystery Lake, go back to the Carter Hydro Dam and head down the Winding River to Pleasant Valley. Bring any spare transmitter repair materials.
* In Pleasant Valley, repair the final transmitter tower at Signal Hill. Wait until the aurora starts at night, and follow the signal (no need to change regions this time). Collect the two documents to wrap up this part of the quest.
* This will be your last time in Pleasant Valley, so again make sure to pick up any valuables you want to carry forward before moving on. You don't need to hang on to your spare transmitter repair materials, they will no longer be needed.
* Head out of Pleasant Valley through the Abandoned Mine to Coastal Highway. After these stressful times chasing strange radio signals under auroras, it's time for a vacation of sorts.

**5. Coastal Holiday**

* Arguably, you could skip this whole section if you just want to get on with the end-game DLC quests. You should be pretty much fully kitted out with high-tier equipment by now, so there is little incentive to looting in this area of the game. But it's a beautiful place to see and weather is generally more clement here. So treat yourself to a little seaside vacation before you get back to the harshness of the Far Territories. You can just take in the main sights before moving on if you like.
* After arriving in Coastal Highway, the nearby Abandoned Lookout tower has a spectacular view of the region. Other sites of interest include the Coastal Townsite, Quonset Garage (which makes a convenient local base), houses on the islands in the bay, and the fishing camp.
* By now, the trader should have contacted you by radio during a previous aurora night (only if you enabled the trader at the start of the game). If you want to trade with him, you need to first agree to a trade on the radio, then use the lockbox at the ocean-facing dock at Misanthrope's Homestead. I found that there was no value in doing so during my play-through, again because you should already be fully kitted out by now. But you do you. There are some quests associated with the trader. These quests would take you around the different regions once more, but it takes significant time to first establish trust with the trader (by completing numerous trades) and involves quite a bit of backtracking. You can consider doing this after completing this play-through, if you're still up for more.
* From Coastal Highway, follow the road south to Crumbling Highway and then Desolation Point. In Desolation Point, you can visit the Lonely Lighthouse, the Riken shipwreck and Hibernia Whale Processing plant. Then return to Coastal Highway the same way you came in.
* Pick up your valuables (you will not be coming back) and exit Coastal Highway through the tunnel to the Ravine. Your route will essentially follow the rail tracks all the way to Transfer Pass.
* In the Ravine, a suggested diversion is to find a rope and deploy it to climb down to the Ravine Basin. Follow the river in the Ravine Basin to enter Bleak Inlet once more, this time in the upper, smaller area of the region. There you can explore the Pensive Lookout (great views) and Echo One Radio Tower. If you find the code to the Cannery Workshop door and want to get in there (during an aurora), you will need to deploy a rope near the Pensive Lookout. I did not bother with it. There is also a prepper cache you can check out on your way back to the Ravine.
* From the Ravine Basin, climb back up to the train tracks (it's a long climb!). Follow the tracks to Mystery Lake, Forlorn Muskeg, Broken Railroad, the Far Range Branch Line and Transfer Pass. You are passing through these regions for the last time, so collect any needed valuables from your bases along the way. Pick up coffee, herbal tea, stashed ammo for your weapon(s) and a thermal flask if you have any, to be ready for the final stretch. Make sure to bring your warmest clothes and crampons.

**6. Buried Echoes**

* From Transfer Pass, return to the Forsaken Airfield region. At the airfield, wait until a glimmer fog or an aurora starts. It should hopefully not take too long. Use the downtime to prepare/repair your gear and clothing. You want to bring your weapon(s) of choice with ammo, your warmest clothing, coffee, tea and ideally a thermal flask. You can also do some hunting and build up useful skills like cooking, if you are not yet at Level 5.
* When the glimmer fog or aurora starts, use the handheld radio to track the final structure. You may have to start walking east from the hangar for a little while before the radio actually picks up the signal. Explore the structure and pick up two more documents. This will complete the Signal Void quest, and trigger the start of the next quest: Buried Echoes.
* Next head to the transition cave connecting Forsaken Airfield with the Zone of Contamination and Sundered Pass regions. This is a massive cave system, by far the largest in the game. I encourage you to use an online map to find your way. One such map is included in the interactive map I linked  above: you need to click on the small label saying ‚Äútransitional cave connected to 3 regions‚Äù on the world map. In the cave, follow the route that exits at the Zone of Contamination.
* As you will soon realize the Zone of Contamination has plenty of poisoned wolves, which are more aggressive than the regular kind. Keep your weapon(s) handy.
* The Buried Echoes questline will take place entirely in this region, and will take you through the main points of interest. The quest has to be followed in a specific order. Rather than detailing all the steps here, I will refer you to the legend in the online map for Zone of Contamination (linked above). Look for Steps 1 to 6 and see where the corresponding numbers are on the map. Be aware that Steps 1 and 2 require using the handheld radio during a glimmer fog or aura event.
* When you first arrive in the region, I recommend going to the right towards Dubious Overlook and then follow the road/railroad towards Idle Camp and Boss's Settlement (where Step 1 is located). After that, the route to follow should be quite straightforward so I will skip details.
* You should look for the Respirator before heading down into the mine (see Step 3 in the map legend). The respirator needs to be equipped from inventory (or first aid quick menu) to be used and requires filter canisters to function. The canisters are only consumed when in an hazardous gas area so you don't need to take the respirator on/off constantly.
* If you find them, Chemical Boots will allow you to walk through toxic areas without damaging your footwear.
* I recommend stashing any heavy secondary equipment (extra weapons, hacksaw, fire fuel, etc) before heading down into the mine. You don't want to be over-encumbered down there. You can also take off clothing items that reduce your sprint bar. After you are done exploring the mine (when Step 5 is complete), come back to your stash and pick up the heavy items before moving on.
* The mine galleries are quite extensive and have several levels. Thankfully you can click on ‚ÄúLangston Mine‚Äù in the world map linked above to significantly aid your navigation.
* Once you have completed the Buried Echoes quest (Step 6 in the map legend), the next and final Tales of the Far Territories quest will automatically start: Last Horizon. Enter the large transition cave again and this time navigate to the Sundered Pass exit.

**7. Last Horizon**

* This is it ‚Äì Sundered Pass is the final region you will discover in this play-through. It is one of the most beautiful, but also challenging ones. If you disabled timberwolves and cougars in your custom game settings, you will actually encounter few predators. But you will feel the alpine environment. The higher you go, the lower the temperatures and the fewer the available resources. Having warm food and drinks will help you on your outings, especially when combined with a thermal flask. Crampons (and coffee) will be needed for some rope climbing sections.
* Similar to the previous quest, you can follow Steps 1 to 6 in the region's online map legend. To get started, follow the path left when you enter the region from the transition cave.
* Steps 1 and 3 will require an aurora or glimmer fog event, which you may have to wait for. You should be aware that auroras are only visible in one direction in the sky in this region, towards the lower elevation. Also many wooden cabins don't have electrical wiring, so don't count on everything lighting up around you when it happens. You'll have to keep an eye out. You may also have to be relatively close to the signal source for the handheld radio to start tracking it.
* To go from Step 1 to Step 2, you can't use the weather station access road because the bridge is broken. You'll have to backtrack a bit. If you skirt around the weather station hill and arrive under the broken bridge, you can take a shortcut straight down to the plateau below. It's convenient and fun, but be prepared for a few sprains.
* If you pass by Refuge Cabin A at Lotte's Rest (between Steps 2 and 3), you can use it to stash any extra gear that will not be needed in the next few days. Keep going with the quest, and you will be back here after Step 5. Pick up your stashed gear and make your way back to the Forsaken Airfield region to finish the quest. You can use the transition cave again, or go through Transfer Pass, as you prefer.
* Back in Forsaken Airfield, you will know what to do. That will conclude the Last Horizon questline, and the Tales of the Far Territories. Congrats! As far as I'm concerned, you've completed Survival Mode.
* If you want some extra, you can explore what's left of the Forsaken Airfield map. I was just short of 100 days in my run when I finished the Tales so it was a nice way to round it off. You can follow the road from the airfield to Mindful Cabin, passing a crashed Cormorant helicopter along the way. (Off-topic but TLD-adjacent: [These](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV20tUzYJeU) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFRfCQ-v5PQ) [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ISBkoSkeQU) winter survival gear and training for these helicopter crews. Made by Cormorant pilot u/mattfrom103). After Mindful Cabin, you can visit the Island Cottage. Both these locations are isolated but pretty cozy, with great views. I reflected on the journey that took me here and chose to hang my rifle on the wall at the Island Cottage before closing the game. The end.

-----------------------------------------

Many people face difficulty managing their body weight. Finding something new to help feels like a hard task sometimes. I understand this feeling. There is a drink people talk about now. It is called mushroom coffee. It is becoming popular in many places. People say this coffee might help reduce body weight. They make this claim. My purpose here is to look at this drink. We will see what it is. We will check how it might work for body weight. You will learn about the possible ways it could give support to your body goals. This drink is not magic, but it may offer some help. Let us see the facts about this mushroom coffee and body weight. It is important to learn true things.

What This Mushroom Coffee Is
----------------------------

This drink is not like soup with mushrooms. You do not taste like cooked mushrooms. It is normal coffee but with something added. People put extracts from special types of mushrooms into the coffee. These are not cooking mushrooms. They are called medicinal mushrooms. The extract is a strong part of the mushroom. It is not the whole mushroom body. Common types of mushrooms used are called Lion's Mane, Reishi, Cordyceps, Chaga, and Turkey Tail. Each type has different properties. The coffee still tastes mostly like coffee. Some people say it is smoother. The mushroom part is there for its reported health effects. This mix is simple to make. It is coffee with a special powder or liquid from these mushroom types.

Does This Coffee Help with Body Weight?
---------------------------------------

People ask if mushroom coffee truly helps body weight go down. I must tell you, it is not a quick fix. It is not like turning a switch. This coffee *may* support your efforts. It can be a helper. But you still need to eat good food and move your body. These things are most important for managing body weight. Science studies are still new for this coffee specifically for body weight. Much study looks at the mushroom extracts by themselves. They do not always study the coffee mix with extracts for this one purpose. So, we know some things about the mushroom parts. How the coffee plus mushrooms work together for body weight is not fully clear yet from many studies. It is a possible support, not the main answer.

How Mushroom Coffee Might Help Body Weight
------------------------------------------

Thinking about how this coffee could give support for body weight is interesting. It is not one simple way. The special parts inside the medicinal mushrooms might do something. Also, the coffee itself does things to the body. When they are together, maybe they work in ways that help. We can look at how the mushroom parts act alone. Then we can think about how coffee acts alone. When mixed, the effects might combine or change. Some ideas are about how the body uses food for energy. Other ideas are about how the body handles feeling stressed. These are possible paths for how this drink might help with weight.

Giving Help for Body Energy
---------------------------

One way this mushroom coffee might help is by giving more energy to the body. Some kinds of mushrooms in the coffee are linked to energy increase. One type is called Cordyceps. People say it helps with stamina and how the body uses oxygen. If your body has more energy, you might feel like doing more activity. More walking or more moving burns more food energy in the body. Burning more food energy can help body weight go down. Coffee also makes people feel more awake and gives a short energy boost. So, the mushroom and coffee together might help you feel more energetic. This feeling can make it easier to be active every day. Activity is key for weight management.

Controlling Body Stress and Wanting Food
----------------------------------------

Another possible way mushroom coffee supports body weight is by helping with stress. Some mushrooms are called adaptogens. Reishi is one example. These mushrooms are thought to help the body handle stress better. When people feel much stress, their body makes certain chemicals. These chemicals can make the body hold onto fat. Also, high stress can make some people want to eat more food, especially unhealthy food. If the coffee helps reduce stress feelings, it might help stop this kind of eating. It might also help the body not hold onto extra fat because of stress chemicals. There are also thoughts about blood sugar, but the link to body weight from that is not very direct for this coffee yet. Managing stress is a known part of good health and weight care.

Special Mushrooms and Body Weight Links
---------------------------------------

Certain medicinal mushrooms commonly found in this coffee have specific ideas about helping with body weight. We can look at two main ones. Cordyceps mushroom is often talked about for energy. Reishi mushroom is known for stress help. Cordyceps is said to help the body use oxygen better. This can mean better ability to do exercise. If you can exercise more or harder, you burn more energy from food. This burns calories. Burning more calories helps reduce body weight. Reishi is an adaptogen, meaning it helps the body adapt to stress. High stress can make weight loss harder. Reishi helps the body feel calmer. It can also help with sleep. Good sleep and low stress are very important for managing body weight well. These mushrooms offer these specific possible helps.

More Good Things About This Coffee
----------------------------------

This mushroom coffee is not just maybe helpful for body weight. The medicinal mushrooms inside are linked to other good things for the body. For example, Lion's Mane mushroom is thought to help the brain. It might help with clear thinking or focus. Other mushrooms like Chaga and Turkey Tail are linked to helping the body's defense system, the immune system. Some mushrooms also have properties that help with inflammation, which is swelling inside the body. So, drinking this coffee might give you benefits beyond just body weight ideas. It could be a drink for overall feeling better. People drink it for these other reasons too. It is a drink for general wellness support.

Picking Good Mushroom Coffee and Using It
-----------------------------------------

If you want to try this coffee, pick a good one. Look for products that say they use mushroom *extracts*. Extracts are stronger than just dried mushroom powder. Make sure they tell you what kinds of mushrooms are in it. It is good if they are clear about where the mushrooms come from. Organic or clean sources are better. You can drink this coffee like your regular coffee. You can replace one cup of regular coffee. Or maybe add it as an extra drink for a boost. To see if it helps, you need to drink it regularly, not just one time. Remember, it works best if you also eat good food and exercise. It is a helper, not the whole plan.

Possible Bad Points and Who Should Be Careful
---------------------------------------------

There can be things to watch for when drinking mushroom coffee. Some people might have stomach problems from the mushrooms. It can make the stomach upset. The coffee part has caffeine, which affects some people. If you are a woman who is pregnant or feeding a baby, you should ask a doctor first. If you have problems with your body's defense system (autoimmune problems) or take any medicines, talk to a doctor. The mushrooms could interact with medicines. Remember, this coffee is like a supplement. It adds to your diet. It is not a medicine. It does not replace advice from a doctor or common ways to lose body weight, like diet and exercise plans from experts.

I'm not sure how unimodal they are in comparison to SSP's options, but it closer than what I've used before (Mazzer, Macap burrs). 

  
I've been surprised that this grinder doesn't require a large grind setting range. On my old grinders, if I tried grinding a medium roast at a setting that I previously ground a light roast, that shot would choke. Vice versa, light on a medium setting, the shot would gush. On the Philos, almost everything works within a click or two of 25. For pour over, everything is within a click or two of 105. Whether it's light or medium, the range doesn't vary from this point. It just seems odd that unimodal would require a really limited grind range.



I have also experienced less consistency after the first few pounds of coffee. Initially, I would get a consistent jump of 4ish seconds between clicks.

Any ideas what to do?

1l5om8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/goldenyearsgains/comments/1l5om8i/why_drinking_more_water_isnt_fixing_your_hydration/,Why drinking more water isn‚Äôt fixing your hydration,"You know the drill.

Feeling off? Drink more water.

Cramps? Water.

Low energy? Water.

Foggy during workouts? Probably dehydration, right?

So you chug. A gallon a day, maybe more.

Still doesn‚Äôt help.

That‚Äôs because hydration isn‚Äôt just about water.

# More water ‚â† more hydration

This is what most people get wrong.

Water alone can actually make the problem worse‚Äîespecially if you're low on electrolytes.

When you drink a ton of plain water and sweat a lot (from workouts, sauna, summer heat, etc), you‚Äôre flushing out sodium, potassium, and magnesium.

But you‚Äôre not putting any of it back.

That‚Äôs like bailing water out of a sinking boat without plugging the hole.

You feel bloated but dry.

Tired but wired.

Your brain‚Äôs like ‚Äúwtf,‚Äù but your pee is clear so you assume you‚Äôre fine.

# Signs you‚Äôre ‚Äúoverwatering‚Äù without replenishing

* You‚Äôre peeing every hour but still thirsty  
* You feel lightheaded when standing up quickly  
* Your muscles cramp randomly (especially at night)  
* Fasted workouts suck even with enough sleep  
* Post-gym fatigue hits harder than the workout itself  
* You need coffee *after* lifting just to stay awake  

It‚Äôs not a water problem.

It‚Äôs an electrolyte problem.

# Sodium is not the enemy (for most people)

A lot of folks are scared of sodium.

Probably because every fitness article screams about blood pressure and ‚Äúlow-sodium diets.‚Äù

That‚Äôs not the full picture.

If you‚Äôre active, sweating, fasting, or eating low-carb, you‚Äôre *already* low on sodium.

Carbs help retain salt. Cut the carbs? You lose water and sodium fast.

Add heavy training to that and you‚Äôre basically leaking electrolytes like a broken hose.

For most lifters, athletes, or keto people, **more sodium = better hydration**.

# What happens when electrolytes are too low?

You hit that weird zone.

Water isn‚Äôt cutting it. Energy tanks mid-set. Your brain fogs over mid-sentence.

No matter how much you drink, something feels off.

This is where people think they need more preworkout, or more sleep, or more carbs.

Sometimes it's none of those.

Sometimes you're just flatlined on electrolytes.

# How to check if it‚Äôs really hydration

* Add salt to your food (a little more than usual) and see if energy improves  
* Try drinking water with a pinch of sea salt and lemon‚Äîjust once, not forever  
* Pay attention after sauna sessions or long hot days‚Äîdo you feel ‚Äúoff‚Äù despite drinking tons?  
* Track weight before and after training (if you‚Äôre losing 1‚Äì2lbs, you‚Äôre losing fluid + salts)  

# The hydration trap most people fall into

They assume clear pee = good hydration.

It‚Äôs not.

Clear pee might just mean you‚Äôve flushed out everything, including the minerals you actually need.

Colorless isn‚Äôt the goal.

Feeling sharp, strong, and focused is.

That only happens when water and electrolytes are in balance.

# final thoughts

If you‚Äôre training hard and still feeling tired, flat, or crampy‚Äîeven with ‚Äúenough‚Äù water‚Äîyou‚Äôre probably missing the real fix.

Electrolytes matter.

Especially sodium.

You don‚Äôt need to overhaul your diet.

Just rethink what hydration actually means.

Stop chasing water like it‚Äôs a magic cure.

Hydration is *not* just about the liquid going in‚Äîit‚Äôs about what stays behind and powers your body.

# TL;DR

* Drinking tons of water doesn‚Äôt fix hydration if electrolytes are low  
* Sodium is essential if you train, sweat, or eat low-carb  
* Clear pee =/= good hydration  
* You might feel better adding back salt, not more water",1,1749313057.0,goldenyearsgains,0,1.0,False

Introduction
------------

In our fast-paced world, the concept of fair trade often takes a backseat to convenience and profit. Yet, faith calls us to a higher standard‚Äîone of justice, equity, and respect for every individual involved in the trade process. This devotional invites you to explore the foundation of fair trade through the lens of our faith, encouraging you to take actionable steps towards promoting fairness in every transaction.

- - - - - -

Scripture Focus
---------------

**Proverbs 11:1 (NIV)**: ‚ÄúThe Lord detests dishonest scales, but accurate weights find favor with Him.‚Äù

Reflection
----------

God‚Äôs desire for fairness is woven throughout Scripture. The imagery of weights and measures signifies integrity, emphasizing that every interaction should be marked by honesty and respect. In the marketplace of life, this principle transcends monetary transactions; it speaks to our relationships, our community engagements, and our stewardship of resources.

### Questions for Reflection:

1. **In what areas of your life can you pursue more honesty and fairness?**
2. **How does your faith compel you to support equitable trade practices?**
3. **Are there organizations or businesses you can support that prioritize fair trade?**

- - - - - -

Application
-----------

### 1. **Educate Yourself and Others**

Understanding fair trade is essential. Take time to research how products are made, the labor involved, and the environmental impact. Share your knowledge with friends and family. Host a gathering to discuss fair trade benefits and why consuming ethically is vital.

### 2. **Support Fair Trade Products**

Make a conscious effort to seek out fair trade items. This might mean buying coffee, chocolate, or clothing that comes with fairness certifications. Every purchase is a vote for the kind of world you want to support.

### 3. **Advocate for Justice**

Use your voice to advocate for just trade practices. Write to your local representatives or participate in community initiatives that promote fair wages and ethical consumerism. Your advocacy can lead to systemic change.

### 4. **Practice Gratitude**

Incorporate gratitude into your daily life, acknowledging the hands that contribute to what you consume. Whether it‚Äôs the farmers, artisans, or workers, recognizing their efforts fosters a spirit of appreciation and responsibility.

- - - - - -

Prayer
------

Heavenly Father, thank You for the gift of community and the resources we share. Help us to see the value in every person involved in the trade process. May our choices reflect Your love and commitment to justice. Give us the strength to advocate for fairness and the wisdom to make informed decisions. Amen.

- - - - - -

Closing Thought
---------------

Faith in fairness is not merely an ideal; it is a call to action. As we journey together towards promoting just trade, may we embody the love and justice of our Creator, ensuring that every interaction reflects His heart for fairness and integrity. Each small step towards fair trade can ripple out, creating significant change in our world.

Let us commit to being agents of fairness in every transaction, embodying the principles of justice that our faith upholds.

1l5oko4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ellykatstans/comments/1l5oko4/paul_blart_and_the_tin_foil_man/,Paul Blart and the Tin Foil Man,"It was a quiet Monday at the West Orange Pavilion Mall. The scent of pretzel lingered in the air, and Paul Blart was on his Usual Segway patrol, humming along to the faint sounds of elevator music echoing off the tiled walls. His senses were sharp. His eyes scanned every storefront. His mustache twitched slightly. Something felt... off. 

Near the food court, a crowd had gathered around the fountain. Paul rolled in, parting the sea of gawking teens and confused parents. 

And there he stood. 

A man completely covered in *tin foil.* Head to to. Helmets, boots, cape, and even a belt made from twisted foil sheets. He shimmered like a baked potato in a microwave. His eye were hidden hidden behind two circle of plastic wrap.

""I am the Tin Foil Man!"" he boomed, striking a pose. ""I have come to protect this mall from the mind control frequencies emitted by fluorescent lighting!"" 

Paul Squinted. ""Sir, you can't just""

The Tin Foil Man launched into a bizarre dance that included lunges, jazz hands, and karate moves. Kids started recording him on their phones. A small child offered him a cheese stick. He declined, citing ""aluminum dietary restrictions.""

Paul knew what he had to do. He approached calmly. 

""Sir, I respect your passion for brainwave shielding, but you're creating a safety hazard and a mild disturbance. I'm going to have to ask you to""

The Tin Foil Man whipped out a foil baton. ""Back, mall knight! I sense government signal all over you!""

Paul raised an eyebrow ""That's my blood pressure monitor.""

A chase ensued

The Tin Foil Man sprinted through the mall like a heat reflective blue. Paul was hot on his tail, Segway tires squealing past kiosks. They zipped through the candle shop (Tin Foil man knocked over a display of lavender-scented anxiety stones), past the arcade (Paul weaved through a pack of teens playing DDR), and right into the Auntie Anne's pretzel stand. 

In a blur of action and carbohydrates, Tin Foil Man tripped on a salt shaker, skidded across the floor, and landed face-first into a tray of cinnamon twists.

Paul handcuffed him gently. ""You're coming with me, shiny guy."" 

Later, in the security office, they discovered the truth. The Tin Foil Man was actually a local conspiracy podcast host named Gary. Who had recently binged 3 documentaries and drank 12 cans of Pepsi. 

""I just wanted to spread awareness."" Gary mumbled, still wearing his foil boots. Paul nodded. ""Next time, do it with a pamphlet. Not a power stance."" Gary was released with a warning and a free coupon. 

Back at his desk, Paul sighed and sipped his coffee. ""Just another Monday."" 

And somewhere, in the dim a flicker of a vending machine light, the tin foil shimmered quietly... waiting.
