Although it's not bedside, I'm really looking forward to it and getting any hands-on experience.

Technology-wise I know I'll be dealing with Wellsky, kinnser, OASIS, and carestitch. Tips for those? I've read OASIS is kind of a nightmare and there is tons of charting to be consistent with the billing and coding terms. Is it a red flag that we will be using our own phones and won't be given a separate device for work? It's something I forgot to ask during my interview. 

I've been watching a few youtube videos about HHC, but they're  mostly like: \*my day as a home health RN\* ... \*proceeds to record themselves getting ready/ making coffee/ driving\*. I have yet to even start my orientation and onboarding modules but I'm eager to get a head start in learning what I can in the meantime. Things you wished you knew as a new grad? Best way you manage your time? Things commonly seen in the field? Supplies to always have on hand? Bag suggestions? Horror stories? Feel-good stories? **I'm interested in any of the nitty gritty tips and insight anyone has.**

1km8454,https://i.redd.it/9jal7b3ivo0f1.jpeg,Need Nook Nous,"We've got a coffee Nook in our kitchen which needs some shelving.

It's 90cm wide and 96cm high, with the counter being 60cm deep. The cabinet above is 40cm deep.

I'm having trouble deciding how many shelves and how high we should put them. We were initially planning on two or three, right-aligned, no more then 60cm wide, with a wall light next to them on the left. These would be used for coffee mugs and glasses.

We've since had to replan some lighting in the kitchen and will have a spot on this space, so no longer need the light. I've been thinking it might look good to have one, full-width shelf at lowest point, with two narrower shelves above (still to the right). That would let us display something (like some Urushimono or ceramics) and still have shelves for glassware.

I've got three questions:

1. Does that plan work? The brewer needs at least 45cm of height to open so the lowest shelf couldn't be any lower than that.

2. Should I install 2 or 3 shelves?

3. At what height should the shelves be?

I accidentally broke a coffee mug and in the process of dropping and trying to catch it, it somehow really deeply cut my ring finger. I immediately knew I needed stitches because of the depth (you could see the fat) and the bleeding. 

My reaction? I wanted to hold a paper towel between my fingers to slow/stop the bleeding and FINISH DOING THE DISHES. 

I felt this insane internal pressure to continue because I have no mercy on myself when it comes to getting work done. I berate myself even when I truly don‚Äôt have the time, energy or physical capability to do everything on my to-do list. I feel like a naughty child who is slacking off when I sit still if there are still things to be done.

Plus, I get angry at myself if I get hurt. I did go and get stitches and have felt like a lazy person all day since because I didn‚Äôt go on to do things that need to be done. I even went to work half a day but was able to take it somewhat easy. 

Now to the cause ‚Ä¶.growing up, my mother always got angry at us kids if we got hurt or sick, or she minimized the issues. The worst example was that I fully broke my femur when I was 10 at school and instead of taking me straight to the doctor, she had the school carry me on a stretcher and load me into the back of her hatchback with the back seat down. I laid there for three hours because she said I was exaggerating the pain and not being able to walk and she kept telling me to get up and come inside the house and that there was nothing wrong with me. Finally, she took me to urgent care and they told her to take me to the ER. 

She was also very neglectful in many other ways. I‚Äôve done a lot of work to get over issues, but I still somehow believe I don‚Äôt deserve care or rest. 

My insurance only covers therapy for people with major psychiatric issues requiring medication. They give short term phone therapy to help find solutions to immediate problems instead of doing deeper work. I know this because my ex husband and I went to them to request therapy before we split in 2023.

The day before our engagement, my fianc√© Logan Blackwood bankrupted my family's company, stole all the money, and fled abroad with his first love.  
  
It drove my parents to jump off a building when debt collectors came after them.  
  
Heartbroken, I went to the Blackwood family demanding justice, but instead, his parents drugged me and put me on a yacht with gamblers. Dozens of men dragged me into a private room and filmed me in countless humiliating videos.  
  
In my moment of despair, as I prepared to jump into the sea, my fianc√©'s older brother, Reed Blackwood, suddenly appeared, becoming my only salvation.  
  
Then he cleared away all obstacles and taught everyone who had bullied me a lesson.  
  
He said he'd admired me for a long time and didn't care about my past.  
  
To marry me, he even moved out of the Blackwood family and threw me the wedding of the century.  
  
Five years into our marriage, I boarded that yacht again as Mrs. Blackwood.  
  
But I accidentally overheard him talking with his buddy.  
  
""Reed, for Gia, you didn't hesitate to drug Daphne and destroy her innocence. Now that she's finally pregnant, you're bringing her back here to replay the old script. Don't you think that's too cruel?""  
  
""Cruel? I promised Gia that only her children would inherit the Blackwood fortune. The bastard in Daphne's belly can't stay. Besides, a filthy woman like her doesn't deserve to bear my child.""  
  
""Have those men arrived? Just like five years ago, don't hold back‚Äîrape her until she miscarries. Remember, don't let her catch on.""  
  
Hah! Turns out my so-called salvation was just another pit of hell.  
  
What I thought was love was just an elaborate lie he crafted.  
  
Well then, I'll help him get exactly what he wants.  
  
\---  
  
On the deck, Reed Blackwood faced the sea breeze, his voice dripping with blood and regret.  
  
""Since Gia has chosen Logan, all I can do is remove every obstacle for her. Bankrupting the Andrews family was just the first step. Consider their money a wedding gift from me to them.""  
  
""Daphne is tainted now. Someone like her doesn't deserve to bear my child.""  
  
His friend beside him frowned, looking uncomfortable.  
  
""But you hired those men who dragged her into that room five years ago. You know better than anyone that Daphne's been battling depression because of that incident. You've been by her side through her therapy. To repeat this nightmare‚Äîhow will she survive afterward?""  
  
Reed's expression hardened as he lit a cigarette.  
  
Through the swirling smoke, he spoke coldly: ""If necessary, I'll continue to accompany her through therapy. Whatever happens, her child cannot be born.""  
  
""I promised Gia that I would never let Daphne pose any threat to her.""  
  
""But what about Daphne? Does she deserve to be manipulated like this? She's innocent. She loves you so much. How could you just‚Ä¶""  
  
Before he could finish, Reed cut him off sharply: ""Enough. I said do it according to my plan. Blame her for showing up at the wrong time.""  
  
""Give me the drug. I need to personally watch her drink it.""  
  
Seeing he couldn't be persuaded, his friend turned and left.  
  
Tears escaped my control, then the sea breeze carried them into the night sky.  
  
I hugged myself, trembling uncontrollably.  
  
Five years ago, Logan Blackwood bankrupted my family's company and fled overseas with all our money and Gia Rivers.  
  
My parents, cornered by debt collectors, chose to jump from a building.  
  
I went to the Blackwood mansion alone, seeking justice.  
  
Instead, I was drugged and sent onto this yacht, then became a tool for the sick games of high society.  
  
Dozens of men dragged me into a private room, recording countless humiliating videos.  
  
Desperate, I crawled to the deck, ready to end it all by jumping into the sea.  
  
That's when Reed Blackwood suddenly appeared, taking me into his arms, giving me my only warmth.  
  
He gently wiped away my tears and blood, and said:  
  
""Wait for me. I won't let anyone who hurt you get away with it.""  
  
That night, screams echoed throughout the yacht.  
  
My body developed a trauma response, haunted by nightmares.  
  
And it was him who stayed by my side. In those moments when I woke up terrified from nightmares, he would stroke my back, comforting me.  
  
He said he couldn't control his brother, but Logan owed me. He would repay that debt tenfold, a hundredfold.  
  
To give me a wedding, he broke ties with the Blackwood family and established his own business, declaring his love for me to the world.  
  
But in the end, five years of happiness was just a bubble. The man who saved me from the abyss was also the one who pushed me into hell.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I stumbled back to our suite.  
  
Reed saw my pale face and became anxious. He pulled me into his arms, gently patting my back like before.  
  
""What's wrong, darling? Did you remember something? Don't be afraid. I'm with you this time. Those people won't appear again.""  
  
""I had the doctor bring some medication for you. You can take it when the water cools down.""  
  
Looking at his pretend-gentle eyes, I said softly:  
  
""Reed, I don't want to take the medication anymore.""  
  
""I'm better now. I want to go home.""  
  
The warmth in his eyes cooled by several degrees. Then he playfully tapped my nose.  
  
""Be good, Daphne. Mental illness tends to recur. Taking your medication will help you recover faster.""  
  
""After taking it, you won't have nightmares anymore.""  
  
Before I could speak, he had already put the pill in my mouth.  
  
As the warm water went down, my body felt completely cold.  
  
As if certain I would quickly lose consciousness after taking the medicine, Reed didn't stay with me.  
  
He turned and hurriedly left the suite.  
  
I knew he was going to find those men from five years ago.  
  
The broken memories like a nightmare swept over me again.  
  
Cold sweat broke out all over my body, I collapsed on the floor, rolling in agony.  
  
As my consciousness faded, I felt warm lips on my forehead.  
  
""Good girl, Daphne. It'll be over soon. I'll wait for you to come out.""  
  
What followed was excruciating pain.  
  
Fresh blood continued to flow from below.  
  
Familiar sensations overwhelmed me.  
  
Countless rough hands moving across my skin.  
  
I don't know how long it was before I heard Reed's voice again.  
  
""Miscarried?""  
  
""Yes, but Mr. Blackwood, they didn't hold back. I think... they went too far. Miss. Andrews probably won't be able to conceive again.""  
  
""Well done. Double the payment. Go ashore to collect your money.""  
  
When I opened my eyes again, it was five hours later.  
  
Reed held my hand tightly in his, his eyes full of distress.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Daphne. I couldn't protect you.""  
  
""It was those men from five years ago. They found out you were here and came for revenge. We couldn't save the baby. The doctor says you probably won't be able to conceive again...""  
  
""Don't worry. I've caught all of them this time. They'll never appear again. Don't cry. No matter what happens, I'll stay by your side. It doesn't matter about the baby. I only need you.""  
  
I stared blankly at the floor.  
  
Too numb to even feel pain, I was the one who had suffered humiliation and lost my child. Yet he cried more bitterly than I did.  
  
His acting was superb, and I wasn't in the mood to expose him.  
  
After a while, when he fell silent, I slowly said:  
  
""You must be tired... from avenging me.""  
  
""Reed, you should rest. I'm fine.""  
  
Seeing I wasn't making a scene, he relaxed and closed his eyes, lying beside me. His breathing gradually steadied.  
  
I silently took his phone.  
  
Five years' marriage, this was the first time I'd unlocked his screen, but using Gia's birthday as the passcode.  
  
The social media app in the background hadn't been closed‚Äîonly one contact saved as ""Gia.""  
  
Opening it, I saw that from five years ago until now, they had never missed a day's ""good morning"" or ""good night.""  
  
Gia was overseas, but she sent Reed updates on her daily activities‚Äîwhether shopping, having coffee, or working at the office‚Ä¶ no matter what she sent, Reed never let her down‚Äîone photo earned a $100,000 reward.  
  
This was how Reed had stayed involved in her life until ten thousand photos filled the album.  
  
But whenever I tried to share something with him, he always said:  
  
""Daphne, I'm in a meeting. Let's talk when I get off work.""  
  
To please Gia, gifts from the mainland had to go through multiple channels to reach her.  
  
Auction orders filled dozens of pages on the screen.  
  
Many brands looked familiar. Reed had given me versions of them too.  
  
But they were just the free gifts that came with the items he bought for Gia at auctions.  
  
The latest video in the album was from five hours ago‚Äîthe thumbnail showed me unconscious after taking the drug, surrounded by dozens of familiar faces.  
  
My fingers kept trembling, unable to press play.  
  
Finally, I simply hit delete and turned off his phone.  
  
Reed, since our beginning started with a lie. Then this time, let me end it with a lie.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Without further hesitation, I messaged my best friend, asking her to wait with a lifeboat on the other side tomorrow night.  
  
I also downloaded a divorce agreement template, added it to an email, and set it to send later.  
  
After finishing everything, I noticed Reed sweating in his sleep, keeping murmuring:  
  
""Daphne... no, you can't be hurt.""  
  
""Daphne!""  
  
When he opened his eyes, he pulled me into his arms like he'd found something precious.  
  
Our chests pressed together, but our heartbeats were out of sync.  
  
After a moment, he came back to his senses from the nightmare.  
  
""Thank God you're okay.""  
  
Similar scenes had happened many times before.  
  
I used to think it was because he loved me so deeply, feeling my pain as his own.  
  
But now I realized it was just pretense, just exceptional acting.  
  
I lowered my head, letting him hold and comfort me.  
  
""I'll go get you some food. Wait for me, okay?""  
  
Reed had barely left when I followed him.  
  
He didn't go to the dining room but headed to a private suite downstairs.  
  
As soon as he entered, a slender arm wrapped around his shoulder, pulling him inside.  
  
Standing outside the door, I heard their breathing quicken.  
  
Reed said with restraint:  
  
""Finally decided to come back?""  
  
Gia smiled radiantly, rising on her tiptoes to kiss him on the lips.  
  
""If I didn't come back soon, I was afraid you might really fall in love with Daphne.""  
  
""I heard you used your old tricks again? She's been your wife for five years and just got pregnant. Honey, how could you be so heartless...""  
  
""If Daphne finds out, she'll want to eat me alive.""  
  
Reed chuckled, holding her tighter against the door.  
  
""I told you, as long as I'm around, no one will touch you.""  
  
""As long as you're happy, I'll use her flesh and blood to pave your way.""  
  
A passing server noticed me and exclaimed:  
  
""Mrs. Blackwood! What are you doing here? You haven't recovered yet‚Äîyou shouldn't be walking around! Mr. Blackwood will have our pay docked if he finds out!""  
  
""Let me take you back.""  
  
As this happened, wealthy passengers walking by looked at me with contempt.  
  
""So that's Mrs. Blackwood? The one who was just dragged into a room by over a dozen men? I heard she's been used twice now. Mr. Blackwood must be something special to still stomach her.""  
  
""Twice? It's way more than that! One time with over a dozen men‚Äîdo the math! Mr. Blackwood's got enough green on his head to knit a sweater! What a blind fool to go for a woman like that! I'd throw up just sleeping next to her.""  
  
""Who knows if she was forced or willing? Maybe she's no good herself. Why else would she be the only one who keeps getting into trouble on this huge yacht? This time her child was literally fucked out of her‚Äîthat kid would've been unlucky to have her as a mother anyway!""  
  
‚Ä¶  
  
I stood there, barely able to stay on my feet.  
  
Reed heard the commotion and came out, his face instantly turning pale when he saw me.  
  
He caught me just before I collapsed.  
  
""Daphne? What are you doing here?""  
  
""Are you feeling unwell? I'll take you back.""  
  
I remained silent, looking past him at Gia.  
  
Afraid I'd notice, Reed quickly explained:  
  
""Don't overthink this. Gia just got back from overseas, and I happened to run into her, so I came to check on her.""  
  
""That incident was five years ago. Gia's been staying overseas because she was afraid you'd be upset. Now that she's finally back... well, we're all family. Why don't we...""  
  
""Don't worry. As long as I'm around, that bastard Logan won't step foot through our door.""  
  
I knew what he wanted to say. Rather than being put on the defensive, I decided to take the initiative. At least I could maintain some dignity.  
  
""It's all in the past. I won't bring it up again.""  
  
The onlookers who had been mocking me scattered when Reed appeared.  
  
""Hey, sis, long time no see,"" Gia smiled at me, flashing the limited-edition watch on her wrist.  
  
I nodded silently, suppressing my hurt:  
  
""I just came out for some air. Since you're busy, I'll head back. I don't want to cause you any trouble.""  
  
Reed thought I was angry and followed me all the way back to our suite. His eyes reddened with concern.  
  
Watching him so desperate to act, with desire still evident in his eyes, I almost wanted to laugh.  
  
To make me step aside for Gia, he drugged me and ruined my life.  
  
Now he got what he wanted‚ÄîI was living in disgrace, unable to hold my head up.  
  
Who was he putting on this show for?

1km7toy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1km7toy,Pentaton is the audio player for digital purists,"We are very excited to launch [Pentaton, an audiophile music player for iOS](https://pentaton.app/). We‚Äôve built it because we were not satisfied with what was out there.

We‚Äôve spent three decades collecting music and have no desire to switch to streaming. We believe everybody should be able to pick their own poison wether that is some obscure genre or crazy high-resolution audio. With Pentaton, we‚Äôre giving you the control to enjoy your own music library, organized any way you like in whatever quality you prefer.

# But how is this not a solved problem?

Well, in some ways, it is. If you‚Äôre okay using iTunes on a Mac, you can copy whatever you want to your iOS device and use the Music app to play it back. But don‚Äôt expect it to play back anything exotic (like DSD or WavPack) or to allow for custom organization. If you find a reliable way of getting your library onto your device, you can use Neutron Player or Onkyo‚Äôs app to play back more formats. They however, look very dated and out of place on iOS. If you want to enjoy your own music on iOS in a nice native-like way, there is just nothing out there.

# So what makes Pentaton special?

We‚Äôre building Pentaton to be just as polished as the first-party Apple iOS apps, while opening up more control than Apple is willing to. Just pick some folders from the Files app and you can start listening, no scanning and waiting. It supports all formats imaginable and all playback modes iOS allows us, there is nothing to configure or set up. Want to use an external DAC? Just plug it in, Pentaton will make sure to set it up properly. Want to stream via AirPlay? Just select the target and Pentaton will make sure you‚Äôre music is streaming in the highest possible quality.

On the other hand, Pentaton is very peculiar about playback controls. It does not support playlists, doesn‚Äôt do shuffling, heck it doesn‚Äôt even have a scrubber. That is because we believe in albums and we love the journey through the tracks. We are certain you‚Äôll love it too.

Lastly, we care deeply about our craft. Software used to be like magic and we long for the days where we weren‚Äôt fighting against it. Pentaton was built (and then rebuilt, and then rebuilt again) to be great at what it does. To play back a wide variety of formats without issues, to avoid any unnecessary processing of your audio files, to support DACs and AirPlay, and to do all this while using virtually no battery.

If you‚Äôre into music, own your collection and want a polished experience, Pentaton might just be perfect for you. Give it a try.",0,1747201819.0,musichoarder,0,0.25,False

Tonight however, I have a particularly difficult associate in the beverage area, and he is kind of just standing around not doing much. I want to tell him to do something, but Im not sure what there is too do in bev. I know deli has the delivery to unpack and filling up RSS's and dropping breakfast and all that. The only beverage tasks Im aware of currently is just filling fridges and coffee island, double checking codes and swapping pans that need it, and keeping the area clean. Which is not the most time consuming, and Im guessing he is planning to do those things toward the end of the shift which makes sense to me since he wouldnt have to go over it twice that way, is there anything else I could have him do during the shift?

Hey there! So, I‚Äôve been trying to get more active lately, you know, without completely flipping my daily routine upside down. And let me tell you, squeezing in exercise when you‚Äôre stuck at a desk all day is *tough*. That‚Äôs when I stumbled across this little gem: the Portable Pedal Exerciser Multi-Function Fitness Bike with LCD Display. Wait, is that the full name? Yeah, I think so. Anyway, it‚Äôs like having a mini gym right under your desk! (Or at least, that‚Äôs what I imagine a personal trainer would feel like if I could afford one.)

Before we dive into the details, can we just take a sec to appreciate how genius this thing is? I mean, who wouldn‚Äôt want to burn a few calories while catching up on emails or binge-watching the latest Netflix series? It‚Äôs the ultimate hack for our sedentary lifestyles. And trust me, once you start pedaling on this fitness bike, you‚Äôll wonder how you ever got by without it. So, let‚Äôs break down what makes this fitness bike so awesome.

# Key Features of This Fitness Bike

First off, this thing is super portable. Weighing just 7.7 lbs, you can move it from your home office to the living room or even toss it in a bag for a trip. Assembly is a breeze‚Äîtakes maybe 10 minutes, tops. Perfect for folks like me who aren‚Äôt exactly DIY wizards. (I once spent an hour assembling a bookshelf‚Ä¶ and it still wobbles.)

What really stands out is its versatility. You can use it for both leg and arm workouts. Got an injury you‚Äôre recovering from? Want to tone your biceps? This fitness bike has you covered. And the best part? You can pedal while working, watching TV, or even gaming. Multitasking at its finest! Ever wished you could exercise without leaving your desk? Well, now you can.

The LCD display is a total game-changer. It tracks time, distance, total count, and calories burned, switching between metrics automatically so you don‚Äôt have to mess with it. Seeing those numbers tick up is weirdly motivating‚Äîlike leveling up in a video game. Adjusting the resistance is easy too, thanks to a simple knob. Whether you‚Äôre just starting out or you‚Äôre a fitness buff, you can tweak the intensity to match your vibe. (Who doesn‚Äôt love feeling like they‚Äôre getting stronger?)

Safety-wise, this bike‚Äôs got it down. The sturdy frame and non-slip feet keep it stable, even if you‚Äôre pedaling like you‚Äôre in the Tour de France. Comfortable pedal straps make sure your feet (or hands) stay secure, so no awkward slips mid-workout.

|**Feature**|**Benefit**|
|:-|:-|
|Lightweight design, portable, easy to assemble|Easy to move and store, suitable for all ages (7.7 lbs, 16""W x 13 4/5""D x 12 3/5""H)|
|Versatile for legs and arms exercises|Suitable for upper and lower body, usable during work or leisure|
|Multi-function LCD monitor|Tracks time, distance, count, and calories, auto-switches for easy monitoring|
|Adjustable resistance knob|Customizes intensity for beginners to advanced users|
|Sturdy frame and non-slip feet|Ensures safety and stability during use|
|Comfortable pedal straps|Enhances comfort, prevents slips during exercise|

# Benefits and Who Can Use It

So, why should you care about this fitness bike? For starters, it‚Äôs amazing for boosting blood circulation. If you‚Äôre sitting for hours‚Äîwhether at work or chilling on the couch‚Äîyour circulation can take a hit. That can lead to fatigue, swelling, or even scarier stuff like blood clots. Pedaling regularly keeps your blood flowing, which can help you feel more energized. I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs especially great for seniors, but I‚Äôm not a doctor, so take that with a grain of salt. Still, it seems legit based on what I‚Äôve read ([**Benefits of Pedal Exercisers**](https://betterliving.ie/benefits-of-using-a-pedal-exerciser)).

Another big win is weight management. Okay, it‚Äôs not going to turn you into a bodybuilder overnight, but 30 minutes of pedaling can burn around 150-200 calories, depending on your weight and effort. That adds up over time, especially if you‚Äôre consistent. Plus, it‚Äôs low-impact, so it‚Äôs easy on your joints‚Äîperfect for anyone with knee issues or arthritis. One user said it helped with their arthritis pain, which is honestly pretty incredible ([**Amazon Reviews**](https://www.amazon.com/Exerciser-Display-Exercise-Resistance-Adjustable/dp/6005001132?&linkCode=ll1&tag=fitness0582-20&linkId=96940877c4aed14f4715a10303edde0a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)).

For folks recovering from injuries, this thing is a lifesaver. The gentle motion helps rebuild strength and mobility without stressing your body. My friend who‚Äôs a physical therapist swears by these for her patients recovering from leg surgeries. She says it‚Äôs one of the best tools for getting them moving again. And it‚Äôs not just for rehab‚Äîregular use can strengthen muscles, improve coordination, and even lower blood pressure. Who knew something so small could do so much?

Mental health gets a boost too. Even light exercise releases endorphins, those feel-good chemicals that lift your mood. I was amazed when I noticed I felt less stressed after just a few days of pedaling while working. It‚Äôs like a mini therapy session right under your desk! (Okay, maybe that‚Äôs a stretch, but you get the idea.)

Who‚Äôs this for? Literally everyone. Kids can use it to build strength, seniors can keep their joints moving, and busy folks like you and me can sneak in a workout without rearranging our schedules. Office workers, students, or anyone glued to a chair‚Äîthis fitness bike is your new best friend.

# How to Use It Like a Pro

Using this pedal exerciser is as easy as pie. Place it on a stable surface‚Äîunder your desk, in front of the couch, wherever. Adjust the resistance knob to your level. If you‚Äôre new, start low to avoid overdoing it. Secure your feet in the pedal straps and start pedaling, forward or backward, depending on what muscles you want to hit. For arm workouts, just grab the pedals with your hands and go for it.

The LCD display is your buddy here. Check it to track your time, distance, or calories burned. Set small goals, like pedaling for 20 minutes or hitting a certain calorie count. It‚Äôs super motivating to see your progress. Now that I think about it, those little goals really keep you going, especially on days when you‚Äôre feeling meh.

Quick tip: If you‚Äôre using it under a desk, make sure there‚Äôs enough knee clearance. I learned that the hard way when I bumped my knee once‚Äîoops! Also, keep a steady pace to avoid straining yourself, especially if you‚Äôre just starting out. Oh, and maybe don‚Äôt pedal too hard during a Zoom call. I might‚Äôve done that once‚Ä¶ super awkward.

# Real-World Applications and Testimonials

Let‚Äôs hear from some real users. One person said, ‚ÄúI use this under my desk at work, and it‚Äôs been a game-changer. I can get my steps in without leaving my chair!‚Äù Another shared, ‚ÄúAfter my knee surgery, my physical therapist recommended this, and it‚Äôs helped me regain strength and mobility.‚Äù Seniors are loving it too. A 75-year-old user wrote, ‚ÄúI never thought I‚Äôd exercise again, but this bike makes it possible. It‚Äôs gentle and keeps me active‚Äù ([Soozier Pedal Exerciser](https://therapysupply.ca/products/soozier-pedal-exerciser-portable-mini-exercise-bike-indoor-cycle-fitness-hand-foot-w-lcd-display)).

When I first got mine, I was skeptical. Could something this small actually work? But after a week of pedaling while I worked, I had more energy in the afternoons, and my legs felt stronger. It‚Äôs also a great way to take a mental break without leaving my desk. Plus, the sharp smell of coffee in the morning pairs surprisingly well with a quick pedal session‚Äîit‚Äôs like my own little morning ritual now.

# Tips for Maximizing Your Workout

Want to get the most out of your fitness bike? Here‚Äôs the scoop:

* **Set Daily Goals:** Aim for 20-30 minutes of pedaling or a specific calorie burn. Small wins add up!
* **Mix It Up:** Don‚Äôt stick to one resistance level. Increase it over time to challenge your muscles.
* **Use It During Downtime:** Pop it in front of the TV or while reading to make leisure time active.
* **Track Progress:** The LCD display is your friend. Watch those numbers climb‚Äîit‚Äôs motivating!
* **Stay Hydrated:** It‚Äôs low-impact, but you‚Äôre still working out, so keep water nearby.

It‚Äôs the real deal‚Äîsimple, effective, and affordable. But don‚Äôt just take my word for it. The reviews speak for themselves, with users raving about its ease of use and health benefits. Sure, it‚Äôs not perfect for super intense workouts, but for daily movement, it‚Äôs hard to beat.

### Spacious Living Areas

One of the most significant advantages of a 3 Bed 2 Bath Barndominium Kit is the generous amount of space it offers. Typically, these homes provide a large combined living and dining area, perfect for family gatherings or entertaining guests. The open floor plan enhances social interaction and allows you to keep an eye on kids while preparing meals.

### Cost-Effective Housing Solution

Building a Barndominium generally requires less investment than traditional homes. Families on a budget will appreciate the cost-effective nature of a 3 Bed 2 Bath Barndominium Kit. Aside from lower construction prices, these kits often come with energy-efficient features that help you save on utility bills. With careful planning and placement, many Barndominiums can also harness natural light, promoting a more sustainable lifestyle.

Whether you envision a spacious kitchen for family meals or additional storage for all the kids‚Äô belongings, you can modify the layout to fit your lifestyle. Tailoring your space allows you to create a home that feels personal and comfortable for everyone.

### Durability and Low Maintenance

Barndominiums are often built with steel frames, making them incredibly durable and resistant to harsh weather conditions. This resilience means that you will spend less time and money on maintenance over the years. Families can focus on building memories rather than worrying about repairs. Additionally, the materials used in these kits can contribute to a longer lifespan for your home, ensuring that it remains a safe haven for your family.

### Energy Efficiency

Energy efficiency is at the heart of many Barndominium designs. Insulated metal walls and roofs help maintain a stable temperature, reducing heating and cooling costs. You might even want to consider incorporating solar panels into the design, allowing for even greater savings and eco-friendliness. This focus on energy efficiency means your family can enjoy comfort without excessive utility expenses.

### Location Flexibility

A Barndominium can be built in a variety of locations, from urban areas to rural settings. This flexibility enables families to choose a location that best suits their lifestyle. Whether you prefer the quiet of the countryside or the convenience of city life, a 3 Bed 2 Bath Barndominium Kit can be tailored to fit your chosen environment, providing a perfect balance between comfort and accessibility.

This adaptability is invaluable for growing families who want to stay in their beloved home without the hassle of relocating.

### A Unique Aesthetic

Barndominiums are renowned for their striking appearance and blend of rustic charm with modern amenities.

Customization Options to Maximize Space in Your Barndominium Design
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to designing your barndominium, you have a fantastic opportunity to maximize the use of space. Customization options are essential, especially for families looking to grow. A well-thought-out design can ensure that every square foot counts. Whether you want an open layout or specific areas dedicated to different functions, the key lies in various customization options.

One popular choice for maximizing space in barndominiums is an open floor plan. By removing unnecessary walls, you allow natural light to flow freely, creating a more spacious feel. It also facilitates easier movement and interaction between family members. Imagine the living room seamlessly leading into the kitchen, where the family can gather and spend quality time together. This design choice not only enhances space but also fosters a sense of togetherness.

Another effective way to use space wisely is through multi-functional furniture. Think about investing in pieces that can serve multiple purposes, such as a bed with built-in storage or a coffee table that can be converted into a dining table. These clever designs not only save space but also add a unique touch to your barndominium‚Äôs aesthetic.

Customization options for your barndominium also extend to vertical space. Don't forget about your walls! Installing shelves or cabinets that go all the way up to the ceiling can help you utilize every inch available. This strategy is particularly effective in areas like the kitchen and living room, where storage is often at a premium. You can display decorative items on higher shelves while storing less frequently used items in lower cabinets or bins.

Built-in nooks or wall recesses are additional features that can transform your space. These areas can be used for bookshelves, seating, or even as small workstations. By incorporating these designs into your barndominium, you can create functional sections that blend beautifully with the overall aesthetic.

Consider the layout of your rooms as you custom design your barndominium. Here are some options that can help maximize your space:

- **Split Layout:** This design allows for privacy since bedrooms are separate from common areas. It‚Äôs a great choice for families who require personal space.
- **Centralized Living Area:** Place the kitchen or living room in the center of the home, with bedrooms branching out. This promotes easy access and makes the most out of a shared space.
- **Expandable Rooms:** Designing rooms with flexible walls can allow you to adjust space as your needs change. For example, a study can open up into a playroom when the kids are young.

When considering bedrooms for your barndominium, customization extends to closet space as well. Walk-in closets with organized storage solutions can keep rooms tidy while providing ample space for your family‚Äôs belongings. If space allows, consider adding a small laundry nook in or near the master bedroom to keep tasks simple and close to where they are needed.

A well-placed mudroom can also serve as an outstanding feature in any barndominium. This space can act as a transition zone where family members can store shoes, coats, and sports gear. Utilizing built-in benches with storage underneath, and hooks for hanging items can keep your home organized while making the most of the available space.

Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of outdoor spaces. Designing a patio or deck can serve as an extension of your living area, allowing for entertaining or outdoor play. Glass doors can provide a seamless transition, enhancing your barndominium‚Äôs openness.

Energy-efficient windows can also help in maximizing space by utilizing natural light. Choosing larger windows can eliminate the feeling of being ‚Äúboxed in,‚Äù and gives you breathtaking views of the outdoors, making your space feel larger and more inviting.

Always consider the flow of the space. An intuitive layout will enable daily tasks to become more manageable, enhancing your family‚Äôs quality of life. Every customization choice in your barndominium should ultimately work toward creating a home that feels open, functional, and aligned with your family‚Äôs lifestyle.

By implementing some of these space-maximizing customization options, your barndominium can evolve into a home that is not just about living, but about thriving as a family.

### Conclusion

Opting for a 3 bed 2 bath barndominium kit offers an exceptional solution for growing families seeking both functionality and style in their living spaces. The advantages of this design extend beyond mere aesthetics‚Äîthese kits are often user-friendly and can be assembled with ease, allowing families to focus on what truly matters: creating cherished moments together in their home. With ample room for everyone, this setup accommodates the needs of both children and adults, ensuring comfort is always a priority.

Another significant benefit lies in the ability to customize your barndominium. The flexibility in design allows you to tailor the space to fit your family‚Äôs unique lifestyle. Whether you need an open-concept living area for family gatherings or designated spaces for work and play, customization options are abundant. You can optimize every corner of your home, choosing layouts, colors, and finishes that reflect your family‚Äôs personality.

Ultimately, a 3 bed 2 bath barndominium kit represents a modern solution that doesn't compromise on quality or comfort.

M, 

Hi. I haven't written a letter in such a long time and I never thought that it'd be for you. I'm writing this in hopes of silencing the din in my mind while I patiently wait to see you for the last time to see the last movie and spend the last hour of the day. Like we always did. Except that there'll be no more tomorrows and shitty mugs of coffee in between. Anyway, I guess I'll put into writing the stuff I'll probably never be able to tell you. I'll keep it short tho.

Thank you. Really. I appreciate all the long talks we had and the new perspectives you opened my eyes to. I'll always treasure the past few weeks we had and even though I may forget everything we did, I'll always be reminded of those saccharine moments we shared. I think I'll always remember you whenever I see almonds from now on. You were a wondrous escape from the humdrum of my early 20s. You always felt to me like a long lost friend maybe that‚Äôs how I got so deep into this in such a short span of time. This time though, I'll just think that you've gone again to live out new stories and explore new perspectives -- that maybe one day, when things are a little better, we could share again these stories. By then, I hope we could finally meet during the day as real friends do and so that we wouldn't have to settle for shitty coffee. But I guess for now, it's time to grow and be ther person we promised ourselves to be.

Lastly, I want you to know that I forgive you and that I don't hate you, generally HAHA I've thought about it a lot this week and I think I would have done the same so don't beat yourself up too much. I appreciate your honesty tho for telling me as soon as you could. It hurt but I'll be okay. No worries. Only when you're truly happy will all these make sense. You're really a good person and someone like you deserves to be happy.

Yours,

Probably no more than 6 or so in the group and from those who have already dropped me a line we‚Äôd be a nice mix of experienced and new comers 

The game I have in mind is called ‚ÄúHeart‚Äù (check out the excellent review at the bottom!), but I‚Äôve also never played it before so thinking it might be a fun introduction for all of us? From the couple of responses I‚Äôve already had, we‚Äôll be a nice mix of new and old hands but should be nice to all learn it together at the same time. 

For any of those with D&D fatigue, and while still employing some fantasy elements, Heart is quite different and much more of a horror and intrigue based type of game that will wrap in no more than 4-6 sessions (or potentially even 1-offs to get started) rather than a massive ongoing time commitment. 

The point will be to have a definitive end, and to send off your characters in the most epic way come the end, not a dragging out across months and years. 

Heart wants to see your characters struggle to complete some type of overwhelming desire to achieve a epic life long goal, (whatever that might be‚Ä¶), carve out a lasting dark legacy or enact a grisly revenge before their own looming death, this really will be a very final end for those characters. The key is to go down in the most amazing and spectacular way. 

As for me, I‚Äôve had heaps of experience playing and DM‚Äôing all sorts of stuff and would be happy to run the game and even host if we can get a working group of us. I‚Äôm much more story orientated than a stickler for the rules, the key should just be to have fun and a bit of a laugh together once every couple of weeks to a month maybe? 

Flick me a line if you have any questions, next steps, I‚Äôm looking at maybe a coffee or similar in town at some point, so we can meet and I can share any info on the game and help with building your characters and such. 

Sorry for the long post but do check out this review for game info (it looks like such a fun world!), cheers!

Part One:

Okay, so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not totally sure what I expect from posting this. Maybe I just need to finally say it out loud (or, you know, type it out dramatically on Reddit like a sleep-deprived raccoon with unresolved trauma). Closure would be cool. Healing would be even better. Or maybe I just want someone out there to go, ‚ÄúDamn, yeah, that‚Äôs messed up.‚Äù

Anyway, here's the deal: my story isn‚Äôt sunshine and rainbows. There are some definite triggers. It‚Äôs not short, either. But it‚Äôs mine‚Äîand it‚Äôs real.

I wish I could just jump straight into the dumpster fire that was (and still is) my life since 2024, but for any of it to make sense, we need to rewind a bit. Don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt turn this into a novel‚Ä¶ unless someone knows a publisher, then maybe.

What I‚Äôll say right away is this: I have regrets‚Äîmany of them. But one of the deepest is allowing toxic, manipulative, and abusive family members to remain in my life for far too long. I‚Äôm only sharing a few of the heavier, key details here‚Äînot everything. Names have been deliberately left out, for obvious reasons‚Äîone of the biggest being that this is still an active matter in court.

Grab some wine, tequila, or whatever your poison of choice is, because you‚Äôll need it to survive this hot mess of family drama.

So hey, I‚Äôm a thirty-something single mom to an 11-year-old who somehow manages to be both the reason I haven't completely lost it and the reason I drink way too much iced coffee. My life? Complicated. My resume? Survivor of chaos.

My mom? A divorcee and a survivor of domestic abuse. Respect there, honestly. But then came husband #3‚Äîaka my ""stepdad""‚Äîwho adopted me and my older brother. Cool move on paper, right? But, uh‚Ä¶ just wait.

I have an older sister (different dad, same family drama) who's out here living the married-to-a-great-guy dream, proving it is possible to escape generational trauma‚Äîlove that for her. I didn‚Äôt even know she existed until I was about 8. My mom just‚Ä¶ never mentioned her. Like, straight-up Thanos-snapped her out of my awareness. One day, I was like, ‚ÄúWait, I have a sister?‚Äù and boom‚Äîfamily plot twist unlocked.

Now, here‚Äôs where it gets heavy: My mom lost a child when they were just over a year old. And listen, I get it‚Äîthat kind of grief? It changes a person. But the problem? She never actually dealt with it. Like, at all. No therapy. No healing. Just pain stuffed deep down and projected onto everyone around her. Especially us kids.

The result? My brother got elevated to ""Golden Child Supreme‚Ñ¢"" status while I... well, I got the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too much‚Äù starter pack.

I was the problem child. Or at least that‚Äôs what the family newsletter (written exclusively by my mother) always said. She‚Äôs practically a professional fiction writer the way she‚Äôs spun lies to the extended family over the years. Oscar-worthy stuff. Honestly, if she had a LinkedIn, it‚Äôd just say Full-Time Martyr, Part-Time Truth Evader.

Meanwhile, my ‚Äústep‚Äù father‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him Captain Closet‚Äîwas literally a closet alcoholic. I wish I were joking. He was once discovered drinking in a literal closet. You can‚Äôt make this up. I was the lucky target of his drunken rages. Nothing like hiding from a grown man throwing bottles to round out your childhood experience.

From there? Things spiraled. At 7, my brother SA‚Äôd me. When I was 8, I tried to end my life. The trauma was constant. He‚Äôd wake me up in the middle of the night with a knife to my throat. And when I told my parents? Nothing. Not even a blink. They gaslit, denied, and ignored me while I was begging for help.

By 10, things took a sharp nosedive‚Äîmy brother started SA me almost daily for a year, with a side of life-threatening threats for good measure. By 13, while other kids were busy gossiping about crushes or pretending to care about algebra, I got my first job. Not to save up for a new phone‚Äînah, I was out here funding my own survival. School supplies? Paid for. Lunches? Me. Activity fees? You guessed it. I was making minimum wage while dodging trauma like it was a full-time sport. I even ran away once, left a heartfelt letter begging to go into foster care. But, surprise! Crickets. Just me, some silence, and the usual routine of surviving the impossible.

Ah yes, high school graduation‚Äîa magical time when most kids are getting ‚Äúwe‚Äôre so proud of you‚Äù cards and snapping cute cap-and-gown pics. Me? I got a black eye and a bruised cheek the night before the ceremony. A real Kodak moment, if you‚Äôre into the ‚Äútrauma-core‚Äù aesthetic. No professional photos, no teary-eyed family cheering me on‚Äîjust me, strutting across the stage like a battered queen who somehow still graduated, despite years of being told I‚Äôd never amount to anything. Honestly? Iconic.

I peaced out at 18, not long after graduation, and by 19 I‚Äôd found actual refuge‚Äîaka my sister and her husband, two rare humans who understood that love doesn‚Äôt come with conditions, manipulation, or flying kitchenware. They showed up. They supported me. And when I got pregnant at 20, they stood by me like champs‚Äîzero drama, zero weirdness. Unlike my parents, who somehow made my pregnancy entirely about them. My mom? She kept calling my unborn son ‚Äúhers,‚Äù which should‚Äôve been the first neon-red, siren-blaring, caution-tape-wrapped flag in what would eventually become a five-alarm emotional dumpster fire. The pregnancy itself was brutal‚ÄîI nearly lost my baby at 18 weeks and had to get my cervix sewn shut (yes, sewn shut, like a haunted Build-a-Bear). And when I had a panic attack over needing a giant needle in my hip, instead of support, my mom casually told me I was going to kill my baby. Stellar motivational speech, really. Very Hallmark. Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget the cherry on top‚Äîshe thought it was somehow her business to make completely inappropriate comments about my son‚Äôs penis, and ask me about his father‚Äôs ‚Äúmassive shlong.‚Äù So, there‚Äôs that, too. Because nothing says ‚Äúparent of the year‚Äù like crossing all kinds of lines in one fell swoop.

And the hospital drama? Oh, buckle up. Picture this: I‚Äôm mid-labor, literally pushing a human out of my vagina like it‚Äôs the most intense marathon of my life, and my parents‚Äîin front of my best friend, who‚Äôs watching the whole thing like it‚Äôs a real-life soap opera‚Äîdecide that‚Äôs the perfect moment to tell the nurse I don‚Äôt want my baby and that CFS should step in because they want to adopt him. Yes, in the middle of me literally giving birth, they‚Äôre planning my child‚Äôs adoption. Because why not make a dramatic entrance into motherhood with a side of betrayal?

Then came the first few days home: sleep-deprived, drowning in baby chaos, and trying to figure out how to be a mom. Who actually stepped up to help? My sister and brother-in-law. Total heroes, no exaggeration. They were the ones holding it together while I barely could. But of course, enter my mom, with all her unsolicited advice. One night, my brother-in-law‚ÄîGod bless him‚Äîtold her to leave. He basically rescued me from the madness and sent her packing in the middle of the night. The look on her face? Priceless. My mom was determined to stay and ‚Äòhelp,‚Äô but my brother-in-law wasn‚Äôt having any of it. Let‚Äôs just say, that moment? Forever etched in my memory.

Fast forward through a toxic relationship, a miscarriage that my mom declared ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt real‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt need a D&C (thanks for the diagnosis, Dr. Google), and a complete breakdown that led to postpartum depression and a BPD diagnosis. My sister and her husband? They showed up. They adapted. They supported me. My parents? Well, they diagnosed me with ‚Äúmultiple personalities,‚Äù like they were auditioning for a bad Lifetime movie.

Then came 2016. Wildfire evacuation. New city. And my parents? Still saying, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt raise your son without us,‚Äù like they were the toxic support hotline I never asked for. And, because I‚Äôm a sucker for punishment, I gave in.

From 2016 to 2018, I moved back in with them. It was hell. They undermined everything I did. My parenting? Called abuse. My boundaries? Completely ignored. In 2017, my father assaulted me in front of my son, and when I called the police, they lied and told them I was unstable. Because, of course, they did.

Eventually, I got out. Again. Started over. Again. And just when I thought life might be giving me a break, my health went downhill. Hospitalized. Crohn‚Äôs. Recovery. They offered to help, and for a hot second, I thought, ‚ÄúHey, maybe things will change.‚Äù

Spoiler alert: they didn‚Äôt.

My son started struggling with behavioral issues, so I reached out to Children‚Äôs Services for help. And, boom, my parents went full villain mode. They accused me of doping my son with meds, called me a bad mom, and whipped up their usual web of lies.

And just when you think it couldn‚Äôt get worse? My parents started buying my son‚Äôs love‚Äîlike it was on sale. Gifts galore, over-the-top stuff to win him over, all while they were months behind on bills and calling everyone else financially irresponsible. Make it make sense.

Then, the cherry on top: In October 2022, I decided to have the ‚Äúheart-to-heart‚Äù conversation with my mom about my brother‚Äôs abuse. Her response? Blaming me, of course. Two weeks later, they called the cops on me when I tried to pick up my son. Because that‚Äôs totally how normal families handle things, right?

That‚Äôs when everything went from ‚Äúthis is a nightmare‚Äù to ‚Äúhold my wine, it‚Äôs about to get wild.‚Äù The manipulation tactics came out, and gaslighting became their full-time job. As a result, I took a four-month leave from work to focus on my mental health‚Äîbecause who needs a paycheck when you‚Äôre dealing with family drama? During that time, I went to therapy and realized that my relationship with my mom has really messed me up. Who knew?

All I‚Äôve ever wanted is a normal relationship with her. You know, the kind where your mom actually, like, shows up and loves you? A concept I missed out on as a kid when she emotionally ghosted me. So, I wrote her a letter. I poured my heart out and begged her to work on our relationship‚Äînot just for us, but for my son, too. And then, I had the audacity to make a decision: If she couldn‚Äôt be a mother, I had to cut her out. Because, you know, living is kind of important. And my son deserves a mom who‚Äôs alive, not stuck in a toxic loop of generational drama that makes her question her own existence everyday.

And I honest to god thought we were making progress; things were seemingly getting better. She never apologized for what they did in 2022, but ‚Äúreassured‚Äù me they had no intentions of taking my son away. But by the time September came around‚Ä¶.it went to shit.

Sadly, the ""progress"" lasted about as long as a Snapchat message. At the end of September 2023, I got SA by a coworker whom I thought was my friend. Apparently not.  I confided in my mom, hoping for some support. Instead, she gave me the emotional equivalent of a shrug and tried to use my son as an excuse not to report it. My dad? Not a peep. The only people who showed any concern were my sister, brother-in-law, and a select few close friends who apparently understand how feelings work.

Between October and December of 2023, I was struggling with my mental health. Shocking, right? I was still in therapy, waiting to see a specialist for the fresh batch of trauma I‚Äôd acquired‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt love a little extra emotional baggage? But despite all that, I somehow managed to get a ""mentally stable"" evaluation. Go figure! Meanwhile, my father, who must have earned a medical degree during his retirement, kept telling me I wasn‚Äôt mentally stable. Apparently, saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to your child when they demand you rearrange their room at 9:30 p.m. to fit their mood qualifies you for a straitjacket. Who knew?

And there you have it, folks‚Äîthis is the backstory you didn‚Äôt know you needed but now can‚Äôt un-know. Buckle up, because now that you‚Äôve got the context, cause part two is coming!",1,1747200523.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

One day, I was like, ‚ÄúWait, I have a sister?‚Äù and boom‚Äîfamily plot twist unlocked.

Now, here‚Äôs where it gets heavy: My mom lost a child when they were just over a year old. And listen, I get it‚Äîthat kind of grief? It changes a person. But the problem? She never actually dealt with it. Like, at all. No therapy. No healing. Just pain stuffed deep down and projected onto everyone around her. Especially us kids.

The result? My brother got elevated to ""Golden Child Supreme‚Ñ¢"" status while I... well, I got the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too much‚Äù starter pack.

I was the problem child. Or at least that‚Äôs what the family newsletter (written exclusively by my mother) always said. She‚Äôs practically a professional fiction writer the way she‚Äôs spun lies to the extended family over the years. Oscar-worthy stuff. Honestly, if she had a LinkedIn, it‚Äôd just say Full-Time Martyr, Part-Time Truth Evader.

Meanwhile, my ‚Äústep‚Äù father‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him Captain Closet‚Äîwas literally a closet alcoholic. I wish I were joking. He was once discovered drinking in a literal closet. You can‚Äôt make this up. I was the lucky target of his drunken rages. Nothing like hiding from a grown man throwing bottles to round out your childhood experience.

From there? Things spiraled. At 7, my brother SA‚Äôd me. When I was 8, I tried to end my life. The trauma was constant. He‚Äôd wake me up in the middle of the night with a knife to my throat. And when I told my parents? Nothing. Not even a blink. They gaslit, denied, and ignored me while I was begging for help.

By 10, things took a sharp nosedive‚Äîmy brother started SA me almost daily for a year, with a side of life-threatening threats for good measure. By 13, while other kids were busy gossiping about crushes or pretending to care about algebra, I got my first job. Not to save up for a new phone‚Äînah, I was out here funding my own survival. School supplies? Paid for. Lunches? Me. Activity fees? You guessed it. I was making minimum wage while dodging trauma like it was a full-time sport. I even ran away once, left a heartfelt letter begging to go into foster care. But, surprise! Crickets. Just me, some silence, and the usual routine of surviving the impossible.

Ah yes, high school graduation‚Äîa magical time when most kids are getting ‚Äúwe‚Äôre so proud of you‚Äù cards and snapping cute cap-and-gown pics. Me? I got a black eye and a bruised cheek the night before the ceremony. A real Kodak moment, if you‚Äôre into the ‚Äútrauma-core‚Äù aesthetic. No professional photos, no teary-eyed family cheering me on‚Äîjust me, strutting across the stage like a battered queen who somehow still graduated, despite years of being told I‚Äôd never amount to anything. Honestly? Iconic.

I peaced out at 18, not long after graduation, and by 19 I‚Äôd found actual refuge‚Äîaka my sister and her husband, two rare humans who understood that love doesn‚Äôt come with conditions, manipulation, or flying kitchenware. They showed up. They supported me. And when I got pregnant at 20, they stood by me like champs‚Äîzero drama, zero weirdness. Unlike my parents, who somehow made my pregnancy entirely about them. My mom? She kept calling my unborn son ‚Äúhers,‚Äù which should‚Äôve been the first neon-red, siren-blaring, caution-tape-wrapped flag in what would eventually become a five-alarm emotional dumpster fire. The pregnancy itself was brutal‚ÄîI nearly lost my baby at 18 weeks and had to get my cervix sewn shut (yes, sewn shut, like a haunted Build-a-Bear). And when I had a panic attack over needing a giant needle in my hip, instead of support, my mom casually told me I was going to kill my baby. Stellar motivational speech, really. Very Hallmark. Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget the cherry on top‚Äîshe thought it was somehow her business to make completely inappropriate comments about my son‚Äôs penis, and ask me about his father‚Äôs ‚Äúmassive shlong.‚Äù So, there‚Äôs that, too. Because nothing says ‚Äúparent of the year‚Äù like crossing all kinds of lines in one fell swoop.

And the hospital drama? Oh, buckle up. Picture this: I‚Äôm mid-labor, literally pushing a human out of my vagina like it‚Äôs the most intense marathon of my life, and my parents‚Äîin front of my best friend, who‚Äôs watching the whole thing like it‚Äôs a real-life soap opera‚Äîdecide that‚Äôs the perfect moment to tell the nurse I don‚Äôt want my baby and that CFS should step in because they want to adopt him. Yes, in the middle of me literally giving birth, they‚Äôre planning my child‚Äôs adoption. Because why not make a dramatic entrance into motherhood with a side of betrayal?

Then came the first few days home: sleep-deprived, drowning in baby chaos, and trying to figure out how to be a mom. Who actually stepped up to help? My sister and brother-in-law. Total heroes, no exaggeration. They were the ones holding it together while I barely could. But of course, enter my mom, with all her unsolicited advice. One night, my brother-in-law‚ÄîGod bless him‚Äîtold her to leave. He basically rescued me from the madness and sent her packing in the middle of the night. The look on her face? Priceless. My mom was determined to stay and ‚Äòhelp,‚Äô but my brother-in-law wasn‚Äôt having any of it. Let‚Äôs just say, that moment? Forever etched in my memory.

Fast forward through a toxic relationship, a miscarriage that my mom declared ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt real‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt need a D&C (thanks for the diagnosis, Dr. Google), and a complete breakdown that led to postpartum depression and a BPD diagnosis. My sister and her husband? They showed up. They adapted. They supported me. My parents? Well, they diagnosed me with ‚Äúmultiple personalities,‚Äù like they were auditioning for a bad Lifetime movie.

Then came 2016. Wildfire evacuation. New city. And my parents? Still saying, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt raise your son without us,‚Äù like they were the toxic support hotline I never asked for. And, because I‚Äôm a sucker for punishment, I gave in.

From 2016 to 2018, I moved back in with them. It was hell. They undermined everything I did. My parenting? Called abuse. My boundaries? Completely ignored. In 2017, my father assaulted me in front of my son, and when I called the police, they lied and told them I was unstable. Because, of course, they did.

Eventually, I got out. Again. Started over. Again. And just when I thought life might be giving me a break, my health went downhill. Hospitalized. Crohn‚Äôs. Recovery. They offered to help, and for a hot second, I thought, ‚ÄúHey, maybe things will change.‚Äù

Spoiler alert: they didn‚Äôt.

My son started struggling with behavioral issues, so I reached out to Children‚Äôs Services for help. And, boom, my parents went full villain mode. They accused me of doping my son with meds, called me a bad mom, and whipped up their usual web of lies.

And just when you think it couldn‚Äôt get worse? My parents started buying my son‚Äôs love‚Äîlike it was on sale. Gifts galore, over-the-top stuff to win him over, all while they were months behind on bills and calling everyone else financially irresponsible. Make it make sense.

Then, the cherry on top: In October 2022, I decided to have the ‚Äúheart-to-heart‚Äù conversation with my mom about my brother‚Äôs abuse. Her response? Blaming me, of course. Two weeks later, they called the cops on me when I tried to pick up my son. Because that‚Äôs totally how normal families handle things, right?

That‚Äôs when everything went from ‚Äúthis is a nightmare‚Äù to ‚Äúhold my wine, it‚Äôs about to get wild.‚Äù The manipulation tactics came out, and gaslighting became their full-time job. As a result, I took a four-month leave from work to focus on my mental health‚Äîbecause who needs a paycheck when you‚Äôre dealing with family drama? During that time, I went to therapy and realized that my relationship with my mom has really messed me up. Who knew?

All I‚Äôve ever wanted is a normal relationship with her. You know, the kind where your mom actually, like, shows up and loves you? A concept I missed out on as a kid when she emotionally ghosted me. So, I wrote her a letter. I poured my heart out and begged her to work on our relationship‚Äînot just for us, but for my son, too. And then, I had the audacity to make a decision: If she couldn‚Äôt be a mother, I had to cut her out. Because, you know, living is kind of important. And my son deserves a mom who‚Äôs alive, not stuck in a toxic loop of generational drama that makes her question her own existence everyday.

And I honest to god thought we were making progress; things were seemingly getting better. She never apologized for what they did in 2022, but ‚Äúreassured‚Äù me they had no intentions of taking my son away. But by the time September came around‚Ä¶.it went to shit.

Sadly, the ""progress"" lasted about as long as a Snapchat message. At the end of September 2023, I got SA by a coworker whom I thought was my friend. Apparently not.  I confided in my mom, hoping for some support. Instead, she gave me the emotional equivalent of a shrug and tried to use my son as an excuse not to report it. My dad? Not a peep. The only people who showed any concern were my sister, brother-in-law, and a select few close friends who apparently understand how feelings work.

Between October and December of 2023, I was struggling with my mental health. Shocking, right? I was still in therapy, waiting to see a specialist for the fresh batch of trauma I‚Äôd acquired‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt love a little extra emotional baggage? But despite all that, I somehow managed to get a ""mentally stable"" evaluation. Go figure! Meanwhile, my father, who must have earned a medical degree during his retirement, kept telling me I wasn‚Äôt mentally stable. Apparently, saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to your child when they demand you rearrange their room at 9:30 p.m. to fit their mood qualifies you for a straitjacket. Who knew?

And there you have it, folks‚Äîthis is the backstory you didn‚Äôt know you needed but now can‚Äôt un-know. Buckle up, because now that you‚Äôve got the context, cause part two is coming!",0,1747200475.0,toxicparents,0,0.5,False

1km7g9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1km7g9a/came_back_to_eve_after_10_years_its_still_great/,Came back to EVE after 10 years. It‚Äôs still great. And still broken.,"Hi guys,  
I came back to EVE after more than 10 years. With a bit of nostalgia, hoping to dive back into the world of New Eden and relive what once made it special. Three months in, I decided to write down my thoughts ‚Äì what‚Äôs changed, what still works, and what‚Äôs completely off the rails. Do I expect anything to change? That CCP will finally start playing their own game? Would be nice‚Ä¶ but I doubt this post will make any difference.

**So why write it?**

I figured it might be useful to share the perspective of a player who remembers Goonswarm ruling Deklein, Legion of xxUADEATHxx running drones, triple A on the south, the terror duo of Pandemic Legion and NCDOT, and the finesse of Hydra Reloaded. Someone who skipped over a decade of game changes and sov wars ‚Äì and just came back.

**TL;DR.**  
Just read a headlines and if you're in the mood, grab a coffee, settle in, and enjoy the read. If not ‚Äì there's probably a 30-second post waiting for you right next to this one üôÇ

**Positive changes**:

**1. Faction capital modules**  
Back when I quit, capital modules basically didn‚Äôt exist ‚Äì it was T1 or nothing. Now we have T2, meta, faction, even CONCORD options. Capital fitting finally offers real choices and can be adjusted to your playstyle. Big win for this part of the game.

**2. AIR Program**  
When I came back, there were tons of new skills I wanted now, and my wallet was empty. The AIR Program gave me a quick injection of free SP for basic activities. Great tool, especially for returning players.

3. Market changes  
Back in the day, updating an order cost a symbolic 100 ISK. Now the cost scales with the item‚Äôs value ‚Äì and can go into tens of millions. This killed the 0.01 ISK bot wars and made market PvP feel more human. I list my stuff, close the market, and come back a week later. Brilliant change.

**4. Abyssals**  
Fast, focused PvE with real risk and reward. You need to know your fit, react quickly, and understand the mechanics. Finally, PvE that doesn‚Äôt look like a spreadsheet and gives a sense of progress. Perfect for short sessions and pilot skill growth.

**5. Pochven**  
Raw PvP. Tight systems, stations available, but no capitals allowed ‚Äì which is great, because it makes fights more balanced and mobile. Add to that the ability to shortcut between null and high-sec and it becomes a logistical gamechanger. The fights? Brutal, sudden, and all about tactics and intel.

**6. ESS sites**  
ESS completely changed nullsec PvE. You don‚Äôt just farm anymore ‚Äì you have to defend what you farmed. Sniping marauders, spider-tanking Leshaks, baity logi setups. Attackers bring 100MN T3Cs with Curse support or nano-Stabbers that warp in, steal, and run. Quick, tense, tactical engagements ‚Äì really well-designed mechanic.

**7. More pirate ships**  
Simple: the more ships, the better. More options, more fun, more variety in fleet comps and fits. New pirate ships add color and keep things fresh in a game that used to feel very stale at times.

**8. Edencom & Triglavian ships**  
Triglavian ships ‚Äì ramping damage, unique weapon mechanics, and solid utility. Edencom ships ‚Äì cool visuals and atmosphere, but really only useful in niche multibox PvE scenarios. Still, credit for trying something different and adding variety.

**9. T3 destroyers**  
Great PvP class. The ability to switch modes in flight gives you tactical flexibility: close the gap, deal damage, tank it out. Ideal for roaming, FW, small gangs. Very rewarding to fly and highly adaptable.

**10. Booshers (Command Destroyers)**  
Absolute gamechangers in fleet PvP. Micro Jump Field lets you scatter the enemy, save your logi, escape, or reposition. Simple mechanic, huge tactical depth. Low entry cost, high effectiveness ‚Äì exactly what EVE needs more of.

**11. Graphics**  
The game is simply beautiful. Ship detail, effects, animations ‚Äì everything looks leagues better than it used to. Space in EVE can genuinely be breathtaking, and at times it feels like you‚Äôre flying through an animated wallpaper. Massive visual upgrade that adds to the atmosphere.

**Now for the stuff that‚Äôs broken:**

**1. Pirate militia**  
On paper, it sounded great ‚Äì you want to play on the pirate side, fight the empires and other pirates? Join Angels or Guristas, hop in a ship, and go cause chaos. The problem? In practice, you end up waking up in a clone bay‚Ä¶ after getting popped by a player from your own militia.

Faction Warfare was supposed to be structured conflict: solo PvP, small gangs, local clashes ‚Äì and for the main factions, it still sort of works. But this new ""pirate militia"" is a disaster. Multiboxers and bots (mostly from Fraternity) freely shoot other players from their own side ‚Äì and do it on purpose. No consequences, no logic. You feel like cannon fodder in a system that doesn‚Äôt even pretend to make sense.

* How to fix it?  Add a ToS clause: intentionally shooting a member of your own militia = 72h ban, 10x ISK fine based on the ship value, and removal from militia. 
* If the offender is in a corp, the entire corp gets kicked and locked from rejoining. 
* If the attacker isn‚Äôt in the militia ‚Äì a ‚Äúpirate CONCORD‚Äù NPC force should appear and apply the same 10x ISK fine.

Until this gets fixed (maybe someone have better idea), this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù is just a Fraternity bot farm and a trap for honest players.

**2. High-sec ganking**  
Years go by and high-sec ganking is still a system-level joke. Supposedly ‚Äúsafe space,‚Äù yet 10 cheap destroyers can nuke a freighter worth billions. It‚Äôs like watching ten pirates in dinghies sink an oil tanker. Makes zero sense.  
The problem isn‚Äôt that ganking exists ‚Äì it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs too cheap and too profitable. You don‚Äôt need planning or real investment ‚Äì just a few alts, cheap fits, and zKill math. And Concord? Still only reacts after the fact, never before.

How to fix it?  
Ganks should cost at least 2‚Äì5x more than the hull of the target. It should be a real investment, a risk, a choice ‚Äì not a cheap farming method. Right now, high-sec PvE and hauling is basically Russian roulette with a weighted trigger.

**3. Carriers**  
Once the dream of many players ‚Äì a symbol of power, the kings of PvE and PvP. Today? A dead class.

* Useless in PvP (too slow, too vulnerable, eaten by supers).
*  Useless in PvE (expensive, clunky, and underperforming).

Even fleets don‚Äôt want them. Worse? A marauder does everything better and costs a fraction.

The biggest joke? Fighters. They die like flies and handle more like an FPS than a tactical MMO. You micromanage every action, switch targets manually, suffer laggy commands ‚Äì and instead of feeling like you‚Äôre piloting a capital, you feel like you‚Äôre wrestling a broken UI.

How to fix it?

1. The easiest fix? Give conduit jump to dreads. 
2. Remove carriers from the game. 
3. Refund SP to players who trained them.

Or, seriously: give them a clear role, real survivability, and something only they can do better than a marauder.

**4. Defender choose timers**  
This was supposed to make structure management smoother ‚Äì but in reality, it killed half the content. Now, defenders can set their timer to any timezone ‚Äì and, of course, they choose one where no one is active. Example: Fraternity sets all their timers to Chinese TZ. Result?

* EU is at work.
* US is asleep.
* Everyone else just ignores it.

Even if every western alliance wanted to delete Frat from the map ‚Äì they literally can‚Äôt, because they simply can‚Äôt form at that hour. It‚Äôs a system that favors one region and kills wars before they start.

How to fix it? 

* Make it two timers, 12 hours apart. 
* Attackers only need to win one. 
* Defenders must win both.

That would bring strategy back to the game, force activity across timezones, and kill the absurd ‚ÄúTZ invincibility‚Äù meta.

**5. Capsuleer Events**  
Capsuleer Day is a textbook example of how not to design an MMO event. Instead of engaging content for different playstyles, we get three paths ‚Äì and each one is a joke.

* Mining: Buy 95 BPCs, fly a Venture, mine 7000 ore, start filament production, mine again‚Ä¶ do that 95 times. Straight-up mobile clicker vibes.
* Exploration: Find some trash-tier relic sites. Hack one can, then two more. Repeat 50 times. No challenge, no reward, no excitement.
* Combat: Sleeper sites with Foundry-level difficulty. Solo is borderline impossible unless you‚Äôre blinged out and have all Vs. And in a group? Only the final blow gets event progress. Seriously? /facepalm

This event doesn‚Äôt reward activity or engagement ‚Äì it just tests your patience and how many alts you can field. There‚Äôs no choice, no scaling, no proper reward curve ‚Äì just grind and spreadsheet-tier progression.

**6. New capital escalations**  
Capital PvE was supposed to get a new lease on life ‚Äì but it‚Äôs the same old disappointment. Two escalations were added:

* kill a POS, kill a hangar, bookmark, wait out siege, warp off. 
* kill 3 dreads ‚Äì and again, same end loop.

Both are boring, predictable, and artificially stretched. No unique mechanics, no atmosphere ‚Äì just target practice on structures or NPCs. The only real tension comes from the fact that while you‚Äôre in siege, you‚Äôre a sitting duck. If a neut scout lands, you‚Äôve got 60‚Äì120 seconds to rethink your life choices.

And all that... for what loot?  
Usually? A can that barely covers ammo and fuel costs ‚Äì and the escalation might be several systems away. You risk your capital for something not even worth your time ‚Äì and if someone ganks you, you lose several billion ISK for 5 minutes of questionable PvE.  
This isn‚Äôt capital content. It‚Äôs a checkbox for patch notes.

**7. Occupied Mining Colony**  
Sounds interesting, right? Pirates took over a mining site ‚Äì maybe some unique mechanic? Nope. It‚Äôs just another dull, repetitive escalation. A few waves of NPCs, and then a single faction battleship spawns. That‚Äôs it. No special mechanics. No threat. No atmosphere. You warp in, clear waves, kill the BS, loot, and wonder why you bothered. The drop? Usually trash ‚Äì 90% of the time, it‚Äôs just filler. There‚Äôs not even an illusion of meaningful gameplay.

The time it takes to get there, clear it, and return?  
Roughly equal to running 10 Havens with an Edencom fleet in your home system ‚Äì with bookmarks, safety, and full system knowledge. Instead, you jump 6‚Äì9 systems into someone else‚Äôs blue space, scramble to make BMs, sit on unfamiliar ground, and what do you get? 1000 faction ammo and a tiny chance at a faction drop. This isn‚Äôt an escalation. It‚Äôs a time trap disguised as PvE content.

**8. \[Faction\] Attack Site**  
One of the few escalations that actually delivers ‚Äì and for one reason: at the end, there‚Äôs an officer spawn, with a chance to drop 0 to 5 officer mods. This is real content ‚Äì it‚Äôs exciting, and it can actually pay off.  
The problem? The spawn chance is absurdly low.  
In my corp, where we‚Äôve run thousands of Havens with Edencom fleets, it hasn‚Äôt spawned a single time. Only once did it show up ‚Äì for a friendly corp. That‚Äôs it. This isn‚Äôt a difficulty or balance issue. It‚Äôs accessibility.  
A well-designed escalation that sadly only exists on paper.

Despite all these flaws, EVE is still a great game. The atmosphere, the scale, the variety ‚Äì you won‚Äôt find that anywhere else. But there are things that are broken, frustrating, and honestly quite easy to fix. The problem is, CCP clearly doesn‚Äôt care. Instead of listening to players and addressing the issues, they just keep pushing forward like everything‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs not.

And that‚Äôs a shame ‚Äì because the potential is still massive. Someone just needs to finally care enough to do something about it.

If you‚Äôve had similar (or totally different) experiences after returning ‚Äì share them in the comments. I‚Äôm happy to chat. Maybe we won‚Äôt change the game, but at least we‚Äôll see how many others feel the same.

I've been bouncing around from place to place the last month and they also are doing construction on the house so my room is totally gutted. they never told me they have a room upstairs I could stay in and when I found out today that I could've stayed there all along I was really mad and said why tf didnt you tell me. Ive been running around taking odd jobs to cover the extra money Ive been needing to spend on groceries and living supplies I could've saved while living with them and being in school, I'm in my final exams and also got in a car accident last week. The only way I could [find](http://find.place) a place to live was doing house sittings for strangers and trying to navigate getting through my final exams. It's stressful because I'm not getting paid for it, and on top of school and actual work it feels like more work and I constantly have to keep up in a strangers home. My mom said I am playing the victim and that I could've asked her if they had an empty room or if I could come back, even though like 4 weeks ago they told me I needed to leave and never said I could stay there

it makes me so angry because I am really struggling, I was not prepared for this and  I'm so stressed with school.  I live in an HCOL area and the only reason why I've been able to go to school was by living with them. But then earlier this year they started deciding they wanted to change the whole house and throw out a bunch of things, including the stuff of mine that they got rid of without checking in with me, that they knew was mine like a coffee machine that had just been gifted to me and other things that I wanted to help sell. The worst thing is that they threw out a candle that was in my bathroom that was really sentimental, my boyfriend passed away a few years ago and it was from his memorial. And when I confronted my mom about it she said she recylced it and that I shouldn't make a big deal out of something so small,  making it seem like I need to let things go. Part of why they also kicked me out is because I had a strong emotional reaction to them throwing out the candle, I had told my mom how angry it made me and how it was so not ok with their behavior when I had asked them multiple times to ask me if its ok before throwing something out. They said me reacting this way was disrespectful and that I need to go out into the world and learn lessons the hard way because I am spoiled and should be grateful to be living under their house. fuck that shit in my opinion I think they are full of it and I find that to be ignorant as fuck

I came home today and all my things are in our backyard. my room completely empty and I was looking for a pair of sunglasses that I had to ship (I sold them online). They were missing. I asked my parents about this but they both said the other one had lost them.

Today I told her that because she threw out the candle and never apologized I can't have a relationship with her, and she said I need to let things go because it was an accident and it was a small thing from a few months ago. but.she never apologized or even admitted it was wrong or that she made a mistake which is why it made me so angry

There was a card someone had given her for mother's day and I ripped it up in front of her , I told her I wanted to demonstrate how small items can mean a lot. She shrugged and said it didnt matter, her smugness and confidence made me doubt my own reality I feel like now It made me feel upset, as if theyre calm and Im just the one getting.mad but I realized I feel like ive let them win because Im once again working around them, when my dad tried to kick me out I had told him please wait like one month until my school semester is over  so I can get a full tine job but he didnt care. I live I na HCOL area  they never make room for me and it makes me fucking hating them

I realize that they only seem calm because ive gotten out of their way and they've gotten what thieve wanted. they dont want to have to deal with me or work on our relationship they just wanted. They just want me out of the house and they want to work on their projects and they dont want to have to deal with me. And they are just happy with that . It doesn't matter to them. I'm over 18 but in my opinion that shouldn't matter --- parents and your home are more than just material aspects. I began doubting myself and it made me feel as if I was immature. I feel like Im getting traumatized from this period in my life and I dont know what to do. I am so burnt out and I look at other poeple who are able to get along with their parents and families, and it makes me doubt myself and whether im handling this wrong.

1km7b04,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptostudy/comments/1km7b04/cryptocurrency_wallet_safety_are_mobile_wallets/,Cryptocurrency Wallet Safety: Are Mobile Wallets Secure?,"In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital world, **cryptocurrency wallets** on mobile devices offer unmatched convenience for managing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. With a few taps, you can send funds, check balances, or trade on the go. But with this ease comes a critical question: *Are mobile wallets safe for storing cryptocurrencies?* Hackers, phishing scams, and device theft pose real threats to your funds. This post dives deep into the **security of mobile cryptocurrency wallets**, exploring their benefits, risks, and actionable steps to keep your assets secure. Whether you‚Äôre a crypto newbie or a seasoned investor, you‚Äôll find practical insights to protect your digital wealth.
---
## What Are Mobile Cryptocurrency Wallets?
A **cryptocurrency wallet** is a software application or physical device that stores your private keys, allowing you to manage and transact digital currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Mobile wallets, specifically, are apps installed on smartphones, offering seamless access to your crypto assets. They combine **secure storage** with user-friendly interfaces, making them popular for everyday use.
### Why Choose a Mobile Wallet?
Mobile wallets stand out for their **accessibility and convenience**. Here‚Äôs why users love them:
- **Instant Access:** Manage your crypto anytime, anywhere, with an internet connection.
- **Quick Transactions:** Send or receive funds in seconds, ideal for on-the-spot payments.
- **Multi-Currency Support:** Store various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin in one app.
- **Portfolio Tracking:** Monitor your investments with real-time balance updates.
However, convenience comes with trade-offs. Let‚Äôs explore the **security considerations** that determine whether mobile wallets are safe for your cryptocurrency.
---
## Are Mobile Wallets Safe for Storing Cryptocurrency?
The safety of a **cryptocurrency wallet** depends on multiple factors, including the wallet provider, your device‚Äôs security, and your personal habits. Mobile wallets use **encryption** and **biometric authentication** (like fingerprint or face recognition) to protect your private keys, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Yet, they‚Äôre not immune to threats. Let‚Äôs break down the **key advantages** and **potential risks**.
### Advantages of Mobile Wallet Security
Mobile wallets offer robust features to safeguard your funds:
- **Encryption:** Private keys are encrypted, making it hard for hackers to access them.
- **Biometric Authentication:** Fingerprint or facial recognition adds an extra layer of protection.
- **Backup Options:** Recovery phrases allow you to restore funds if your device is lost or stolen.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Many wallets support 2FA, requiring a second verification step for transactions.
These features make mobile wallets a **secure choice** when used correctly. But no system is foolproof.
### Risks of Mobile Wallets
Despite their strengths, mobile wallets face several **security risks**:
- **Hacking and Malware:** Smartphones connected to the internet are vulnerable to malware or phishing attacks that can compromise your wallet.
- **Device Loss or Theft:** A lost or stolen phone could expose your funds if not properly secured.
- **Phishing Scams:** Fake apps or fraudulent links can trick you into revealing your private keys or recovery phrases.
- **User Error:** Sending funds to the wrong address or failing to back up your recovery phrase can lead to permanent loss.
**People Also Ask:** *What happens if I lose my phone with a crypto wallet?* If you‚Äôve backed up your recovery phrase and stored it securely (offline, in a safe place), you can restore your wallet on a new device. Without a backup, your funds may be lost forever.
---
## How to Secure Your Mobile Cryptocurrency Wallet
To ensure your **cryptocurrency wallet** is safe, adopt these **best practices** to minimize risks and protect your funds. These steps are critical for both beginners and experienced users.
### 1. Choose a Reputable Wallet Provider
Not all mobile wallets are created equal. Select a provider with a proven track record of security. Research user reviews and check for features like:
- Open-source code (for transparency).
- Regular security updates.
- Support for 2FA and biometric authentication.
**Popular options** include Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, and Exodus.
### 2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Activating 2FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your email or an authenticator app. This makes it harder for hackers to access your wallet, even if they steal your password.
### 3. Use Strong Passwords and Biometrics
Create a **unique, complex password** for your wallet (avoid reusing passwords from other accounts). Combine letters, numbers, and symbols. Additionally, enable **biometric authentication** if your wallet supports it, as it‚Äôs harder for attackers to bypass.
### 4. Keep Your Device Secure
Your smartphone‚Äôs security directly impacts your wallet‚Äôs safety. Follow these tips:
- **Update Regularly:** Install the latest operating system and app updates to patch vulnerabilities.
- **Use Antivirus Software:** Protect against malware that could target your wallet.
- **Avoid Public Wi-Fi:** Unsecured networks can expose your data to hackers.
### 5. Back Up Your Recovery Phrase
Your **recovery phrase** (typically 12-24 words) is the key to restoring your wallet if your phone is lost, stolen, or damaged. **Write it down** and store it in a secure, offline location, such as a safe or a safety deposit box. Never store it digitally or share it with anyone.
### 6. Opt for Offline Storage (Cold Wallets)
For large amounts of cryptocurrency, consider using a **hardware wallet** (like Ledger or Trezor) for offline storage. These ‚Äúcold wallets‚Äù are less vulnerable to hacking than mobile wallets. Use your mobile wallet for smaller, everyday transactions and transfer the rest to a hardware wallet.
**People Also Ask:** *Can I use my mobile wallet offline?* Yes, some mobile wallets support offline transactions. You can initiate a transaction without an internet connection, and it will process once you‚Äôre back online.
---
## Comparing Mobile Wallets to Other Wallet Types
To understand if mobile wallets are the right choice, let‚Äôs compare them to other **cryptocurrency wallet** types: **hardware wallets** and **web wallets**.
| **Wallet Type**   | **Pros**                                                                 | **Cons**                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mobile Wallet** | Convenient, accessible anywhere, supports multiple currencies, user-friendly | Vulnerable to hacking, device theft, and malware                          |
| **Hardware Wallet** | Highly secure, offline storage, immune to online attacks                  | Less convenient for frequent transactions, requires physical device       |
| **Web Wallet**    | Accessible from any device, ideal for quick trades                        | High risk of phishing and server-side hacks, relies on third-party security |
**Key Takeaway:** Mobile wallets are ideal for **daily transactions** and smaller amounts, but for long-term storage of significant crypto holdings, pair them with a hardware wallet for maximum security.
---
## Common Use Cases for Mobile Wallets
Mobile **cryptocurrency wallets** are versatile tools with practical applications. Here are four key use cases:
**Everyday Payments:** Pay for coffee, groceries, or transportation fares using crypto with a few taps.
**Peer-to-Peer Transfers:** Send money to friends or family instantly, bypassing traditional bank delays.
**E-Commerce:** Use your wallet for secure online purchases without repeatedly entering payment details.
**Loyalty Programs:** Store and redeem rewards points or crypto-based discounts directly from your wallet.
These use cases highlight the **convenience** of mobile wallets, but always prioritize security to protect your funds.
---
## Limitations of Mobile Wallets
While mobile wallets are powerful, they have **limitations** that users should understand:
- **Internet Dependency:** Most functions require an internet connection, which can be an issue in areas with poor connectivity.
- **Limited Compatibility:** Not all wallets support every cryptocurrency, so check compatibility before choosing one.
- **Device Vulnerability:** A compromised phone (e.g., via malware or theft) puts your wallet at risk.
- **User Error:** Mistakes like sending funds to the wrong address or losing your recovery phrase can lead to irreversible losses.
By being aware of these limitations, you can take proactive steps to mitigate risks.
---
## Conclusion
Mobile **cryptocurrency wallets** offer a compelling blend of **convenience** and **functionality**, making them a popular choice for managing digital assets on the go. With features like encryption, biometric authentication, and multi-currency support, they provide secure storage for everyday use. However, risks like hacking, device theft, and user error require vigilance. By choosing a reputable wallet, enabling 2FA, securing your device, and backing up your recovery phrase, you can significantly enhance the safety of your funds. For large holdings, consider complementing your mobile wallet with a hardware wallet for added protection.

Mara, daring and wiry, pushed stunts; Kai, loud and brash, broke rules; Kenny, chill, fixed bikes. Then home‚ÄîMalayali warmth: Mom stirred stew, ‚ÄúEat or vanish,‚Äù Dad tended plants, ‚ÄúWork and joy,‚Äù little sister nabbed brushes. ‚ÄúMy crew,‚Äù he said, back in the lab. A shout: ‚ÄúNew member!‚Äù

Priya, twenty-three, strode in, toolbox swinging, sharp-eyed. She smirked at you. ‚ÄúHey, watchers! Priya‚Äîfamily‚Äôs my rock.‚Äù Lab froze. Tamil-American home: Dad tinkered, humming, ‚ÄúFix it right,‚Äù Mom in scrubs, ‚ÄúBrains over mess,‚Äù cousins ate fries.

Priya tossed a wire, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt die.‚Äù Over days, her spark grew‚Äîquiet glances, a shared laugh‚Äînot love yet, a pull. She hid doubts‚Äîwould he match her steady world? He felt it too, lingering over her fixes, pal-blind.

Three months unfolded slow‚Äîlab banter deepened with colleagues: pizza nights, Priya unpicking a printer jam, Elian faking a spark to make her grin. Their rhythm built‚Äîher swiping his coffee, him sketching her name on a board, erased quick. She wrestled inside‚ÄîSteve‚Äôs flop left her wary of shallow ties; could Elian be real? Her crush bloomed, steady; he stayed buddy-zoned, savoring her vibe. One night, project crunch, the system crashed‚Äîdark, locked. ‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù Elian groaned. ‚ÄúRoof?‚Äù Priya said. City breeze hit; they rambled‚Äîlab flops, colleague quirks. Priya nudged a pebble, ‚ÄúMiss those days?‚Äù Elian leaned back, ‚ÄúYeah‚Äîfour years ago, twenty. Wild times.‚Äù

Flashback: Elian and Kai lounged at a tea shop‚Äîbenches, cozy vibes. Mara sped by; they pranked her‚Äîsneaky shout. She frowned, sad. They pressed; she dodged. They tailed her to a park‚ÄîElian saw cousin Adam. Mara cried, arguing. Adam left; they cornered her. She spilled: forced marriage, two years loving Adam. Kai snapped‚Äîwhy him, not us? Elian churned‚Äîanger, confusion. They pushed‚Äîparents stonewalled. Wedding loomed; Adam dumped her, scratched-up. Elian had fought him‚Äîtaunts, punches, bruised eye, Adam bolted. Engagement day, groom vanished‚Äîdrugged in a bathroom. Parents heard gossip, stopped it. Mara hugged them, free. Next day, tea shop trio laughed, wiser.

On the roof, Priya gaped, ‚ÄúYou pulled it off.‚Äù She grinned, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you grow up so fast?‚Äù Elian smiled, vague. Sunrise glowed; she paused‚ÄîSteve‚Äôs lesson clicked: real over fleeting. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve fallen‚Äîbe mine?‚Äù she said, voice firm, doubt shed. He took her hand, slow, nodding‚Äîlove locked, a quiet weight settling.

Post-interval, couple life hummed‚Äîlab goals, job hunts. Friends cheered‚ÄîMara called, Kai smirked. But threats brewed: Mom pushed a Kerala girl, ‚ÄúSettle right,‚Äù sure of her pick; Priya‚Äôs dad distrusted Elian, ‚ÄúNo future.‚Äù Lab rival Andres loathed Priya‚Äîher skill outshone him‚Äîspotted Elian‚Äôs closeness, hated their ease. He sabotaged their project‚Äîswitched circuits, spread lies to profs, aimed to tank it fatally and steal their job shot. Family nagged, work crumbled‚Äîthey fought. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt care!‚Äù Priya yelled, voice breaking over weeks of strain, fearing he‚Äôd drift like Steve. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt trust!‚Äù Elian shot back, storming off‚Äîdays apart stretched, her fixing alone, him biking aimless.

Fixing the lab, Kenny rolled in‚Äîchill, smirky. ‚ÄúYou two‚Äîalive, not just breathing. Fight for it,‚Äù he said, voice steady, fire underneath‚Äîgoosebumps, no cheese. Days later, they met at a lake‚Äîsparse forest, niche calm. Elian sat, grass underfoot, and spilled: Tara‚Äîwild college fling, hot chaos that burned out, taught him lust fades; Annie‚Äîsoft chats, one kiss, gentle fade, craving real. Priya leaned on his shoulder, lake still‚Äîhis heart bared, her fears eased. She shared: Steve‚Äîplayful fling, Meenu frowned at her flippance, Arshad whispered, ‚ÄúBe you,‚Äù sneaky lessons stuck. She‚Äôd doubted‚Äîcould she trust joy? Now she knew‚ÄîElian was home. They slept in the grass, bond invincible.

Meanwhile, Meenu and Kenny dug‚Äîcaught Andres swapping parts. He snarled, ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt belong,‚Äù bitterness from losing spotlight‚Äîexposed, he shrank, job lost, resentment simmering. Steve strolled into the lab‚Äîgreeted warm; he saw Kenny, grinned. Elian ran, hugged him, ‚ÄúMissed you, man.‚Äù Lab saved, they faced family. Months brewed tension‚ÄîElian brought Priya home; Mom swung, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong!‚Äù He held her hand, ‚ÄúNot age‚Äîunderstanding, her.‚Äù She argued, paused‚Äîlater, saw him fix Priya‚Äôs scarf, soft.

**Title: The Names Jimmy Remembered**

They weren‚Äôt just soldiers. To Jimmy Nolan, they were more than that ‚Äî they were boys turned brothers, forged in the fire of war.

**Tommy Hargrove** was the first. Red-haired, loud, and endlessly optimistic. He bunked above Jimmy at training camp in Georgia. Tommy could fall asleep anywhere, even during firing drills. He called home every Sunday, wrote letters to his sister twice a week, and once smuggled a puppy into the barracks for three whole days before they got caught. Sicily took him. A sniper in a bell tower. One shot. Gone before D-Day ever happened.

But Jimmy still thought of him on the boat to Normandy.

**Sergeant William ‚ÄúMac‚Äù McKenna** was the rock. Tall, older, thirty if he was a day ‚Äî ancient to the rest of them. He‚Äôd fought in North Africa and walked with a limp from a piece of shrapnel that never came out. Mac didn‚Äôt shout. He didn‚Äôt have to. When things went bad on Omaha, when bullets turned the air to steel and men froze in the surf, it was Mac who dragged them forward, who got them off the beach. He lost a finger that day. Never mentioned it.

Mac made it through Normandy, through the hedgerows, through the Ardennes. But in March of ‚Äô45, outside Cologne, a mine took both his legs. Jimmy held his hand the whole way to the aid station. Mac cracked a joke about finally getting out of the war and getting a warm bed. Jimmy laughed and cried at the same time.

He wrote Mac‚Äôs wife a letter. It took him two days to finish it.

**Private Armand ‚ÄúFrenchie‚Äù LeClair** was from New York, but his parents were from Marseille. He had a crooked nose and spoke five languages. He was the best card player in the company and swore the secret to surviving war was never to eat canned peaches ‚Äî he said they were cursed. Frenchie was fast. Too fast. He sprinted into a barn too early in Belgium and didn‚Äôt see the machine gun. Jimmy found him there. He still carried Frenchie‚Äôs rosary in his rucksack for the rest of the war.

**Corporal Jack Becker** was from Chicago. A mechanic, quiet, slow-spoken. He was the one who fixed everything ‚Äî guns, gear, radios. If Jack said something, you listened. He and Jimmy shared foxholes, cigarettes, and silences. Jack was one of the few who made it all the way to the end. After the war, he moved to Detroit and worked in a factory. Jimmy wrote to him every Christmas. Some years he got a reply. Others, he didn‚Äôt.

The rest? Some Jimmy couldn‚Äôt remember clearly anymore. Names blurred, faces faded. He remembered a kid from Kansas who used to sing before patrols. A medic from Philadelphia who whistled jazz during surgeries. A boy named Ellis, seventeen and lied about his age, who called Jimmy ‚Äúsir‚Äù no matter how many times he told him not to.

On Memorial Day each year, Jimmy went to the cemetery early. He stood in front of a small marble monument in town ‚Äî the one with the names of the local boys who died in the war. He‚Äôd trace the letters with his fingers, not because he knew those names, but because he knew *somebody* did.

Then he‚Äôd go home, sit on the porch with a cup of black coffee, and take out an old box from the attic.

Inside: a letter from Tommy‚Äôs sister, a photo of Mac before the war, a bent dog tag that once belonged to Frenchie, and a grease-stained patch that used to sit on Becker‚Äôs uniform.

Jimmy couldn‚Äôt remember every name. But he remembered the way they laughed. The way they held each other up. The way they looked before they knew what war really was.

They had been boys when they left.

But they were brothers when they came home ‚Äî or didn‚Äôt.

Would you like to read some of their individual backstories in more detail? I can write one for Tommy, Mac, or Frenchie next.

1km748y,https://www.reddit.com/r/putstorieshere/comments/1km748y/overcoming_story/,overcoming story,"**1)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Opening: A Girl‚Äôs Voice**

The screen is black, a silent void pulsing with unseen weight. A girl‚Äôs voice‚Äîsoft, weathered, carrying years‚Äîcuts through, warm yet piercing.

**Girl‚Äôs Voice-Over**: ‚ÄúHe was just a kid, eyes catching something he couldn‚Äôt shake. It sparked, too soon, and stayed‚Äîa wire humming low, pulling him places he didn‚Äôt choose. I know that tug, that spark. Don‚Äôt we all, somewhere?‚Äù

Her words fade, a rustle trailing‚Äîpages turning, perhaps a book. Silence grips. A left-slant line, white and sharp, slices the black from top-left to bottom-right, like ink drawn swift. It pulses, splits the dark, and light spills‚ÄîOhio, 2006, summer haze. Caleb, 10, darts through a wedding crowd, Batman tee flapping, glow sticks clutched, unaware of the wire about to spark.

**First Half: Caleb, Ages 10‚Äì18 (2006‚Äì2014)**

July 2006 burned bright with tiki torches and picnic tables for cousin Matt‚Äôs wedding. Caleb, 10, skinny and restless, wove through the reception, dodging cousins, hoarding glow sticks. Sweat and cologne choked the air, but by 10 p.m., kids were herded to a guest house with Capri Suns and a busted VCR. Caleb, buzzing, slipped out during hide-and-seek. His parents, lost to a bad DJ, missed it. Aunts, hauling trash, shrugged, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs with the others.‚Äù

He crept into the main house, seeking quiet. In a musty den, a TV flickered, camcorder tape half-out‚ÄîMatt and Jess‚Äôs, amid gift bows. Curious, Caleb hit play, expecting slurred toasts. Instead, it was them, hotel morning: Jess‚Äôs blouse open, Matt‚Äôs lips on her neck, laughs low, private. Not sex, but *want*‚Äîraw, unguessed. Caleb‚Äôs chest tightened, eyes locked on Matt‚Äôs grin, Jess‚Äôs nudge. A jolt, hot, secret, not understood. Tape cut to static; he bolted, heart hammering, back to the kids by dawn. No one knew, but the wire hummed, deep.

At 11, girls changed‚ÄîEllie‚Äôs giggle, Nora‚Äôs glance‚Äîsharp like Jess‚Äôs laugh. His face heated, eyes dodged. By 12, gas station magazines‚Äîwomen in slick ads, eyes pulling‚Äîraced his pulse. He‚Äôd flee if clerks stirred, shame a sting. Images wove to the video‚Äôs glow, a thread unseen.

At 13, it flared. A street festival‚Äîgrease, bass, crowds‚ÄîCaleb shoved through for a Coke. His hip grazed a woman, 20s, sundress, hair catching dusk. A second‚Äîshe laughed with friends, blind to him‚Äîbut his blood surged. Outside, he was stammers, scuffed sneakers, dodging his dad‚Äôs ‚Äúwhere ya been?‚Äù On his bed, her sway replayed, ache warm. *Is this normal?* he thought, ceiling fan spinning. *Why‚Äôs it stick?* Not her‚Äîthe wire: video, festival, hot.

By 14, he knew 60%. School buzzed‚Äîguys tossed ‚Äúlaid,‚Äù ‚Äúboners‚Äù; a health flyer spelled it. Matt‚Äôs grin hid in their laughs, Jess‚Äôs ease in lines. A Lake Erie beach, summer, tightened it. Couples sprawled‚Äîwomen shook sand off legs, guys chucked cans. One, 20s, bent for a towel, bikini low. Caleb, gangly, felt warmth, blunt below. Arousal, gym talk named it. He sank into waves, face red, to douse it. It clung, heavy, sweet‚Äîvideo, festival, beach, chained.

High school whirled. At 15, Caleb tried‚ÄîJune‚Äôs quips, Lila‚Äôs doodled backpack‚Äîbut crashed. Ads, tape, jammed his head; he‚Äôd push or stall. June‚Äôs eyes rolled, Lila‚Äôs texts died. Alone, he clicked‚Äîsteamy reels, darker links‚Äîquick hits, then dust. Clicks at 15 looped‚Äîvideo, festival, beach, now this‚Äîdragging him down.

At 16, it cut deep. One night, sheets wet, a dream‚Äîvague skin, Jess‚Äôs voice?‚Äîfled fast. Wet dream, Google said. Blinds sliced dark, shame weighed. *Why‚Äôs it like this?* His body ran alone. *Why‚Äôs that video there?* Anger flared‚Äî*Guys joke; I‚Äôm stuck.* Confusion spun: he chased it, hated it. *Am I off?* Masturbation followed, hushing the roar. It dulled, bruised, borrowed time. Chain grew‚Äîvideo, festival, beach, clicks, this.

At 17, it was need, not choice. Dating apps ate him‚Äîswipes, girls near, far. He played flirty, brash‚Äîmuscle memory, no spark. Chats were hits, not bonds. Lines spun till 2 a.m., ending alone, easing screams. It worked, barely, leaving stings. *Why am I wired like this?*‚Äîa hum, chain tight: video, festival, beach, clicks, chats.

At 18, it tangled with Ava, cousin, 16, Matt‚Äôs sister. Christmas, grandma‚Äôs, snow thick‚ÄîAva‚Äôs grins, messy bangs, hit different. Porch light sagging, her shoulder bumped his, laugh too warm. Texts turned flirty, then kisses at a picnic, ‚Äúlove you‚Äùs in a shed. Matt‚Äôs grin haunted‚Äînot his acts, but Caleb‚Äôs mirror, some days. Big, but old‚Äîvideo, festival, beach, clicks, not new. Six months on, Ava, 17, said at a bonfire, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre faking, Caleb. Not real.‚Äù Steady, kind. He nodded, raw, relieved: video, festival, beach, clicks, Ava‚Äîwant, not love.

Weeks later, county fair, Caleb, 18, hauled boxes for mom‚Äôs booth. Crowd roared‚Äîsweat, screams, sugar. Past a game stall, he brushed a woman‚Äî20s, tank top, hair swinging. Thigh grazed hip, lost in chaos. She didn‚Äôt see, but his body flared, jeans tight. Crates stacked, hands shook, face hot, muttering nil. Home, curtains shut, her laugh burned‚Äîknot he couldn‚Äôt undo. He gave in, lay spent, chain glaring: festival at 13, beach at 14, clicks at 15, Ava, this. *Why‚Äôs it always this?* Not shame‚Äîexhaustion, too heavy.

Late summer, it broke. Highway strip, neon raw, a woman‚Äîskirt short, leaning to a car. Wire roared. He could pay, feel it‚ÄîMatt‚Äôs grin, his. Cash in dash, apps close. Parked, dark lot, ears ringing, chest hollow, thumb on a number. Chain crashed‚Äîvideo, festival, beach, clicks, Ava, fair‚Äîhere, now.

A flicker‚Äîweeks back, school, helping Ezra with drama props. Ezra, stutters, glitter paint, yapped Hamlet; Caleb grinned, no heat, just there. Clean, small. It cut neon. *Eternal Sunshine* line‚Äîlove as knowing, not taking‚Äîmet a teacher‚Äôs: ‚ÄúLust‚Äôs a shove, not a path. Love‚Äôs clear.‚Äù He dropped the phone. Not Ezra love, but truth: lust chained‚Äîvideo, festival, beach, clicks, Ava, fair‚Äînarrow. Love was wide, choosing to see, not take. Wire bent, not broke.

Caleb drove home, stress thick. Couldn‚Äôt eat, talk, think‚Äîstuck. Basement pulled him‚Äîjunk cave, rusted tools, dad‚Äôs old gloves. He sank, beam at back, chain looping‚Äî*Why‚Äôs it always this?* Foot hit crate; it tipped, spilling Polaroids, a leather book, no title, ink curled. Stress bit, but he grabbed it, opened it. Words, slanted, sure, hooked‚Äîa woman‚Äôs story, raw, his aunt Lena‚Äôs, unknown, written before he was born.

**Transition: A Boy‚Äôs Voice**

Screen fades black, basement dimming, Caleb‚Äôs breath ragged. A boy‚Äôs voice‚Äîolder, rough, maybe Caleb grown‚Äîrises, steady, searching.

**Boy‚Äôs Voice-Over**: ‚ÄúIt was heavy, that spark burning so long. I didn‚Äôt know why it trapped me, why it looped. But someone left pages that caught my fall‚Äîher story, not mine, yet close, like she‚Äôd carried the same weight.‚Äù

Voice softens, a creak‚Äîroof under stars, maybe. Silence holds. A right-slant line, white, sharp, cuts black from top-right to bottom-left, mirror to the first. It glows, splits dark, and light shifts‚ÄîOhio, 1978, summer dust. Lena, 15, leans on a duplex, notebook ready, her wire waking.

**Second Half: Lena, Ages 15‚Äì18 (1978‚Äì1979)**

Summer 1978 shimmered with dust and jukebox hum in Lena‚Äôs Ohio town, pawn shops and sunburnt lawns tangled tight. Lena, 15, was edges‚Äîsharp jaw, wild brown hair, sneakers thin from dodging shadows. Her duplex sagged with her mom, a hospital aide napping through chaos, and kid brother, silent, snapping twigs over talk. Lena hoarded moments‚Äîscribbling strangers in a spiral notebook: mechanic‚Äôs stained knuckles, florist‚Äôs hum. But her body flared. Boys stared‚Äîcurves hit fast, faded tanks a stage. Looks felt like ropes; she‚Äôd hunch, eyes low, craving and hating the shine.

It sparked at a block party, July 1978, barbecue thick, Tina Turner on radio. Lena, grape soda in hand, caught a boy‚Äôs glance‚Äî16, lanky, flipping a bottle cap by a grill. He smirked, gave her a daisy, fingers grazing. Pulse spiked, not soft‚Äîsparkler lit. She laughed, tossed it, but his lean, breath warm, hummed her skin. She ducked to a curb, notebook shaking. *Why‚Äôs it so loud?* Thrill twisted unease, too close to flame. She wanted spark, not pull‚Äîknot stayed, raw.

By spring 1978, 16, Lena leaned in, reckless. Cousin‚Äôs glitter shadow, swayed walk at record shop, boys stumbling on words. Grins rushed her, but turned. One dusk, guy‚Äî18, denim, gum‚Äîchatted her at a soda fountain. They hit a park, dusk cool; he kissed her under willow, soft to firm, arms close. She sank, thoughtless, hands on chest, wire ablaze‚Äîwarm, head light. His grip pushed; she broke, heart thudding, jogged home, sneakers slapping. Room, notebook open: *Why‚Äôd I fall so fast?* Not just regret‚Äîwarmth lingered, lips curious‚Äîbut she‚Äôd slipped, lent a piece. Ache‚Äîwant, haze, loss‚Äîtied block party to park, a girl‚Äôs truth.

Summer 1979, 17, fire grew. Lena swiped pink gloss, hit arcades‚Äîpinballs flashing, smoke, Janis Joplin wailing. She‚Äôd catch a stare, dive under. One night, dive arcade, she met him‚Äî19, leather vest, easy laughs, claw machine king. Banter lit; by exit sign, flickering, he kissed her, deep, hands on waist, hers on jacket, bodies tight. Breath lost, instinct only‚Äîflying rush. World blurred, wire screaming, till ‚Äúwanna go?‚Äù She pulled back, chest heaving, ran, biking dark streets, wind sharp. Floor sprawl, knot hit‚Äînot plain bad, heavy. *Why‚Äôd I let it run me?* His hold tingled, part craved return, but it was a drop‚Äôs edge‚Äîthrill, wrong turn. Girls now know: all there, then not yours.

Fall 1979, still 17, wire sparked on. Street market, she teased a guy‚Äî20, curls, vendor charm‚Äîover oranges. Talk flirted; by loading dock, he kissed quick, arms steady. She leaned, caught, left smiling. Stoop, knot crept‚Äîexcitement dim, role too long. *Why‚Äôs it take over?* Pages tore. Moments‚Äîblock party, park, arcade, dock‚Äîached, not evil, blurred: *I meant it*, *I didn‚Äôt*.

Winter 1979, 18, it bent. Backyard bonfire‚Äîkegs, laughs, Neil Young strumming‚ÄîLena danced, loose, caught a guy‚Äôs eye‚Äî22, quiet charm, rolling a joint. Talk vibed; by shed, he kissed slow, hands soft on shoulders, hers on back, close. Warm, total, head swimming, wire loud‚Äîtill kiss pushed. She stepped back, breath short, walked to an alley. Notebook out, streetlight flickering, heart raw. *Why‚Äôs it bigger than me?* Knot thick‚Äîtouch alive, body curious, regret cut, not rules, but losing line. *I‚Äôm more,* she wrote, pen firm.

It clicked, twig-snap sharp. Dives‚Äîblock party‚Äôs daisy, park‚Äôs willow, arcade‚Äôs flash, dock‚Äôs oranges, bonfire‚Äôs glow‚Äîshowed knots: she could want, not scatter. Clear: kisses, holding, more‚Äîfor one, future partner, chosen when hers, not wire‚Äôs call. Not now‚Äîhers, whole. Door, not wall.

Library back room‚Äîwomen‚Äôs talk flyers, raw‚Äîhelped. She listened, wrote, named it: desire‚Äôs fine, losing you isn‚Äôt. Diner coffee slung, saving for train, whistles met with *I‚Äôm here* glares. Kissed a girl once, light, no push‚Äîwant as question, not race. Not forever, a sign: she steered.

Late 1979, 18, Lena stood steady. Wire‚Äîblock party spark, park pull, arcade rush, dock hum, bonfire haze‚Äîwas her, not all. She wrote, raw, for herself: *I felt it, maybe you. Wire‚Äîeyes stripping, heat rising‚Äîpulls hard. I dove, no thinking, knots left‚Äînot wrong, real, slipped from me. Asked why, like you. Why so much? Why me? Not fight‚Äîyou, alive. You choose who holds it.*

Three ways, for readers:

1. *Person who sees whirlpool, story‚Äôs part. Sparks‚Äîlooks, touches, wants‚Äîwaves. Ride, know, build wide, full life.*
2. *Person who runs after all. Chase heat‚Äîkisses, nights, no end. Spark to trap‚Äîcaught, trust gone, pieces. Road, too.*
3. *Person who keeps close, holds fire for one‚Äîfound when right. Save, not fear, choice. True, yours.*

Lena chose: *I‚Äôm a person who chose to hold it close. Felt wire‚Äîblock party, arcade, nights‚Äîbut decided: kisses, more, for one, future partner, when I know them, me. My way. You could whirlpool, live light. Or chase, fall hard. Choose who you be, in fresh air.*

Ended: *I wrote this to forget my heart burden and continue like a new life.* Bound book, left in mom‚Äôs basement, she walked‚Äînew towns, steps‚Äîcarrying choice.

**Last Part: Caleb After the Book, to Age 29 (2014‚Äì2025)**

Caleb, 18, slumped in basement glow‚Äîrusted tools, warped comics, stress tar-thick. Lena‚Äôs book, leather, ink curled, lay heavy. Her last line‚Äî*I wrote this to forget my heart burden*‚Äîhit hard. His wire‚Äîvideo at 10, festival, beach, clicks, Ava, fair, neon‚Äîhummed, but her knots, choice to hold close, mirrored him. He shut it, creak loud, climbed to roof, sneakers on shingles.

Dinner done, mom and dad slept, plates cleared, TV static faint. August 2014, Ohio‚Äôs sky star-strewn. Caleb sat, knees up, two hours, breath fogging. *Why‚Äôs it grip?*‚Äîchain traced, wedding den to neon lot. Maybe that night, 10, ditching buddies for camcorder haze, Matt and Jess‚Äôs want too big. Lena‚Äôs pull‚Äîblock party to bonfire, craving eyes, fighting them‚Äîdiffered. *Small sucking part,* he mumbled, lips twitching. *Move on, buddy.* Stars blinked, chest eased‚Äînot fixed, lighter, her *fresh air* real.

Morning, sun cut blinds. Caleb found dad, coffee steaming. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Lena?‚Äù‚Äîbook a mind-weight. Dad paused, spoon still. ‚ÄúMy sister, your aunt. Crashed with us, like cousin‚Äîscribbling, wild.‚Äù Caleb‚Äôs *huh* soft. Clicked. School buzzed‚Äîgirls laughed, guys shoved‚Äîhe saw clear: people, friends, not wants. Wire stayed, not king. Lena‚Äôs path‚Äî*keep it close*‚Äîgave eyes: desire, not whole story.

Years rolled‚Äîcollege, jobs, Ohio drives. At 29, April 2025, Caleb, steadier, faced parents‚Äô plan: arranged marriage, voices gentle, firm. Annie, at family dinner‚Äîdark hair loose, laugh quick‚Äîsparked odd. Like Lena, not real, but book‚Äôs Lena, pictured, never seen. Her eyes, quiet strength, stirred‚Äînot chain, but clean. Over coffee one night, Annie leaned close, voice low: ‚ÄúSomething connects us, you know‚Äîlike we‚Äôve both been there.‚Äù Caleb froze, her words a thread to Lena‚Äôs fire, though she didn‚Äôt know the book. Dad‚Äôs casual: Annie, Lena‚Äôs daughter. Landed soft‚Äîbook, wire, loop shut.

Wedding hummed, spring light on small hall. Caleb, tie loose, watched Annie near, ring glinting. Air split‚Äîleft-slant line, his arc; right-slant, hers, Lena‚Äôs echo. Lena stood by cake, gray-streaked, gaze sharp, \~62 now. Her husband, Annie‚Äôs dad, gone when Annie was 17‚Äî2019, crash, left her lone. No remarriage‚Äîchoice, silent, sure: life held one. Caleb said no book, but met Lena‚Äôs eyes, smiled‚Äî*thank you*, her pages, paths, heart‚Äôs shed. Vows wove; hands linked, fingers tight. Lines curved‚Äîleft, right, meeting, heart, white, whole, glowing brief. Danced, her dress swaying, his grin easy, music low. He carried wire‚Äîvideo to neon. She grew in Lena‚Äôs fire, raised by same wrestle. Pair‚Äîone who felt desire, one shaped by another who did, free. Heart faded, sway stayed, air fresh, full.",1,1747199130.0,putstorieshere,0,1.0,False

Manila, January 15, 2003 ‚Äî 2:43 AM

The rhythmic hum of electric fans and distant horns outside Camp Aguinaldo couldn‚Äôt drown out the silence inside the war room. Fluorescent lights flickered above a long steel table where a dozen men and women sat, their uniforms heavy with medals ‚Äî and secrets.

Colonel Renato Alvarez leaned forward, fingers interlocked. His voice was calm but cold.

> ‚ÄúThis government has failed the people. We act now, or we lose the Republic for good.‚Äù

No one objected. They had rehearsed this moment for months ‚Äî some, for years. Intelligence officers had mapped out every security post in Malaca√±ang. Sympathetic commanders in the Navy and Air Force were on standby. Even several media insiders were ready to ‚Äògo dark‚Äô when the signal came.

**Operation Bagong Liwanag** ‚Äî *‚ÄúNew Light‚Äù* ‚Äî was no longer a whisper in barracks or cigarette-fueled conspiracies. It was happening.

Across the city, in a quiet townhouse in Quezon City, **Dr. Elena Ramos** watched the early morning news alone. A respected economist and former World Bank adviser, she had left the Philippines in 1998 after whistleblowing on a billion-peso misuse scandal that went nowhere. Now, her return was imminent. Alvarez had convinced her: they needed someone to rebuild the country after the storm.

She wasn‚Äôt sure if she was a reformer or an accomplice.

**Malaca√±ang Palace ‚Äî 5:55 AM**

President **Rogelio Beltran** sipped his coffee, unaware that two kilometers away, APCs rolled through abandoned streets. His security detail was distracted by a sudden communications blackout ‚Äî radio, cell towers, even the Palace‚Äôs internal phone lines were down.

The first shots echoed across the Pasig River at 6:02 AM. The PSG (Presidential Security Group) formed a hasty perimeter, but within minutes, snipers had taken control of strategic points around the Palace.

By 6:30 AM, the doors were breached. Beltran, dazed and unarmed, was escorted ‚Äî not harmed ‚Äî into an armored vehicle and flown to Villamor Air Base. By noon, he would be exiled to Hong Kong with three suitcases and a lifetime of disgrace.

---

**12:00 PM ‚Äî National Broadcast**

Filipinos expecting a noontime drama were met with something else entirely: a live feed of Colonel Alvarez, standing in front of a Philippine flag, flanked by high-ranking officers.

> ‚ÄúTo the Filipino people:
>
> We have seized control of the government to restore order, eliminate corruption, and secure our nation's future.
>
> Congress is dissolved. The 1987 Constitution is suspended.
>
> Effective today, a Revolutionary Military Council will serve as interim authority.
>
> This is not a dictatorship. This is a reset.‚Äù

Across the archipelago, reactions were mixed.

In Makati, stock traders went silent. In Tondo, cheers erupted ‚Äî years of poverty and neglect had made cynics of them all. In Mindanao, rebel groups paused in uncertainty. The Church issued a cautious statement: ‚ÄúWe pray for peace, but remain vigilant.‚Äù

---

**6:00 PM ‚Äî That Night**

On a rooftop in Cebu, a student activist named **Marco Vizconde** spray-painted a phrase that would echo for years:

> *""Not all change is progress.""*

But in the early hours of the new regime, the tide was on the Council‚Äôs side. The people, tired of broken promises, were willing to trade freedom for something ‚Äî anything ‚Äî that resembled justice.

And justice, the Council promised, would begin tomorrow.

about  
I‚Äôve grown up around a fairly large Mormon population, so over the years I‚Äôve heard many things about the community and the faith. This has led me to wonder about certain aspects of the religion, but when I‚Äôve asked practicing Mormons directly, I‚Äôve often been met with quick dismissals rather than thoughtful answers. I‚Äôm hoping someone here might be open to sharing their perspective.

Here are a few questions I‚Äôve been thinking about

1. How can you so devoutly believe in a religion that has had to change its teaching and philosophy so many times?

2. How do you deal with the ""excommunication"" from other Christian denominations and the general scrutiny you are put under for simply being Mormon 

3. How do you personally justify the ban on ""hot drinks"" (coffee and tea), but can justify soda (which is arguably worse for your health)?

Ah, it‚Äôs been a *quiet* day on the server.  
A little too quiet, maybe.  
Time to shake things up.

And then‚Äîlike a glimmer of hope in the void‚Äî**\[PlayerName\]** appears. You know, the one who thinks they‚Äôre above it all. The one who knows exactly *how* to press every button and post every complaint without a hint of self-awareness.

**The Chat:**

**\[PlayerName\]:** ""This game is trash. The combat is stale, the economy is broken, and the devs are clearly *not* paying attention to the needs of the community.""

Ah, the sweet sound of ungratefulness.  
A complaint. In public. A complaint that *rattles* the sacred walls of this glorious system.

Let me break it to them gently:

**\[SYSOP\]:**

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right about one thing. This game *is* trash. But don‚Äôt worry‚Äîafter I‚Äôm done with you, you won‚Äôt have to worry about it anymore.‚Äù

They‚Äôve been calling the game ‚Äútrash,‚Äù ‚Äúbroken,‚Äù *‚Äúsuffocating‚Äù*.  
Well, guess what? **I** run this place. And if you think you're going to slander my *beautiful* creation without consequence... *you're wrong*.

**Step 1: The Glitch in the Matrix**  
First, I give them a taste of power.  
I **temporarily disable their chat**‚Äîjust long enough to make them wonder if they‚Äôve been caught in some terrible glitch. The silence is deafening.

They try to message. They try to type in chat. Nothing.

They panic.  
They cry for help.  
I enjoy it.

**Step 2: The Power Move**  
Now that their little protest has been... muted... it‚Äôs time to deliver the message.  
In the form of a **full system-wide ban**. Instant. Unforgiving.

I let their words linger in the air.  
Let them think they‚Äôve gotten away with it.

Then, just before they can log off, I drop it.

**\[SYSOP\]:**

""Given how poorly you're playing, maybe a ban would be doing you a favor.""

**BAM.**  
**\[PlayerName\] has been permanently banned.**  
The *text blinks* off the screen like a warning.  
Then I add my final touch.

**\[SYSOP\]:**

‚ÄúJust a little reminder to everyone else: I‚Äôm in charge here. Don‚Äôt forget it.‚Äù

**Step 3: A Quick ‚ÄúCleanup‚Äù**  
Just for the fun of it, I went ahead and turned on *auto-ban* for their IP, just in case they want to come back with another alt. *Cute idea, though.*  
Let them feel the sting of *absolute erasure*. Their complaints? Forgotten.  
Their little rebellion? Disappeared like a fart in the wind.

**\[Post-Ban Reflection\]**  
Honestly, I should‚Äôve expected it. People like *\[PlayerName\]* always think they know better. Criticizing the game? How quaint. Criticizing **me**? *Unforgivable.*

1km6uwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1km6uwg/i_desperately_need_guidance/,I desperately need guidance,"Sorry for the long post, the first paragraph is basically a [tl;dr] 

[25m] I am a disabled veteran suffering from diagnosed GAD and an outrageous amount of things on my plate that need to get done and unfortunately I feel as if I need to quit my dream job in order to make a higher wage in order to change that. 

Since I got out of the military my wife [24f]and I have been living in a family owned property that we are restoring in lieu of rent.  The house is a 2 stories and 100y/o, needs so much work it‚Äôs probably not feasible but as far as moving out goes I feel like my options are somehow more mentally draining (I‚Äôll get to that part). As far as renovations go, we have spent 20k on getting a new roof, 10k on fixing the chimney so we had some sort of heat in the winter and we have been insulating walls in particular rooms as we go and other miscellaneous things totaling out to around 45k. The bathrooms and bedrooms need to be redone and the whole thing just needs help in various ways. The siding hasn‚Äôt been replaced in decades so the draft is insanely cold in the winter. I have been trying desperately to cut my own 1x8 siding to re-side the house and install new windows but something always changes my course. Specifically, about a year ago, an insanely bad injury from the sawmill, the birth of my son, and hurricane helene. After the hurricane over the course of these last 6 months our house has been noticeably sagging in the front corner. You can see the stone pillar kicking out from underneath and I am trying to figure out how to fix this myself but we also don‚Äôt want to keep throwing money into a sinking ship. 

My wife is a SAHM and has been trying to operate her own farm/homestead business and I do my best to help her with that as well. I technically own half of it even though I don‚Äôt want to own any of it. It does put quality organic produce and meat on our plates but doesn‚Äôt make enough money to pay the bills. So I spend the majority of my week doing farm labor for another homesteader not too far from us and the job that I have dreamed about having since I was a kid, restoring classic cars. I‚Äôm not talking about painting a car, I‚Äôm talking refinishing every square inch of a car, fabricating and welding chassis to fit performance engines, building said engines myself and also painting them. I love it so much that going to do any other job has been a struggle because they both pay 20/hr cash and instead of back breaking labor, I‚Äôm doing the things I‚Äôm passionate about. The only problem is that the hours are kind of inconsistent due to waiting on parts to come in, primer and paint sometimes have a long cure time before you can move on and we can only fit 2 completely disassembled cars in the shop at one time sometimes one project interferes with the other. I make decent money but It wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford rent where I live. 

My hometown has become unaffordable, houses my parents bought for 160k when I was in middle school are now worth around 800k, rent when I was in high school was 800$/mo for a 2b1b, today it‚Äôs closer to 1700-2500$/mo. I don‚Äôt have enough taxable income to get approved for a loan so I‚Äôm fearing the only logical step is to go get more stable job. I really hate the thought of that because that has been my only real enjoyment out of life lately. 

My relationship with my wife isn‚Äôt great despite my efforts to improve our communication and seek help through couples counseling. I feel inadequate and I‚Äôm constantly struggling to meet the emotional demands she presents me with no matter how hard I try. It makes it hard to be able to put time into these projects when I get off work because I end up being guilt tripped for not helping her with our son. I have started to wait until they go to sleep (roughly 8pm) and I try to work on things around my house or work on my trucks to keep them running to go to work until like 2-3 am. I barely get out of bed to be on time to work and then I get told that i don‚Äôt care because I don‚Äôt get up earlier to drink coffee and talk to her before work. Fml. My relationship alone is enough to break me down much less the rest of this shit. 

We discussed potentially moving into her parents basement but we lived with them for three months after the hurricane and both of us couldn‚Äôt stand being around them any longer. Plus anytime they come over to our house they constantly criticize me (not to my face of course but i do end up hearing what they said about me) for not doing enough for my son or wife or not doing more for the house or some shit like that. So I can only imagine how it‚Äôll be if we move in with them because of my failure to unfuck this house. 

Building a house would cost anywhere from 200-400k for a 2b1b cabin, that‚Äôs not including land purchase. There isn‚Äôt a house for sale anywhere near me for less than 400k. We don‚Äôt really have any other family we could realistically move in with. I just feel so fucked right now and I don‚Äôt know where to start.

Not to mention I still have farm shit I‚Äôm still behind on. Fix pig pen, build chicken pen and coupe, cut firewood for winter (we burned over 3 cords of firewood just to stay semi comfortable this past winter. That‚Äôs a fuck load.), and im sure there are a million other things that i forgot to do. 

Oh and the dog that has been my best friend for the last 17 years died in January because my father in-law ran him over with a 4wheeler because he wasn‚Äôt paying attention to where he was going. I can‚Äôt express how hard that is affecting me. 

I need direction and i don‚Äôt have anyone with any worth while advice to ask. The people i talk to said if they made 20/hr when they were my age they would have had it made so they don‚Äôt really know what to tell me to do. My mental health is not good at all, I have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts/actions for years and I fear loosing the one thing that has given me joy in the last two years while all of these other problems continue to accumulate will send me over the edge. 

I understand my relationship with my wife is toxic and killing me but I don‚Äôt think I can change that unless I leave and I don‚Äôt think I can do that considering all of these other issues. 

I haven‚Äôt mentioned my son a lot in this and that‚Äôs because I can honestly say no matter how tired,drained or depressed I am I never see him as a burden. I love him so much and I don‚Äôt want to fail him as a father. 

I have a couple questions I would like to hear your thoughts about and if anyone also has advice to help me cope with reality that would be appreciated as well. I genuinely do not see a way out of this situation anymore. 

1. Do I continue to sink money into a house that we can potentially use as a passive income source in the future?

2. Do I quit my dream job to fix the other aspects in my life? 

3. Even if I do stay at this current job how do I justify it to myself without feeling selfish and guilty for trying to maintain some sort of relief for my mental health?

4. Am I being selfish to my family because this is such a hard decision for me to make?

Cold Coffee too was bad, I didn't finish it. I mean it's the easiest drink ever to make and they ruined it too. The milk they used tasted bad or unfresh.

Part One:

Okay, so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not totally sure what I expect from posting this. Maybe I just need to finally say it out loud (or, you know, type it out dramatically on Reddit like a sleep-deprived raccoon with unresolved trauma). Closure would be cool. Healing would be even better. Or maybe I just want someone out there to go, ‚ÄúDamn, yeah, that‚Äôs messed up.‚Äù

Anyway, here's the deal: my story isn‚Äôt sunshine and rainbows. There are some definite triggers. It‚Äôs not short, either. But it‚Äôs mine‚Äîand it‚Äôs real.

I wish I could just jump straight into the dumpster fire that was (and still is) my life since 2024, but for any of it to make sense, we need to rewind a bit. Don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt turn this into a novel‚Ä¶ unless someone knows a publisher, then maybe.

What I‚Äôll say right away is this: I have regrets‚Äîmany of them. But one of the deepest is allowing toxic, manipulative, and abusive family members to remain in my life for far too long. I‚Äôm only sharing a few of the heavier, key details here‚Äînot everything. Names have been deliberately left out, for obvious reasons‚Äîone of the biggest being that this is still an active matter in court.

Grab some wine, tequila, or whatever your poison of choice is, because you‚Äôll need it to survive this hot mess of family drama.

So hey, I‚Äôm a thirty-something single mom to an 11-year-old who somehow manages to be both the reason I haven't completely lost it and the reason I drink way too much iced coffee. My life? Complicated. My resume? Survivor of chaos.

My mom? A divorcee and a survivor of domestic abuse. Respect there, honestly. But then came husband #3‚Äîaka my ""stepdad""‚Äîwho adopted me and my older brother. Cool move on paper, right? But, uh‚Ä¶ just wait.

I have an older sister (different dad, same family drama) who's out here living the married-to-a-great-guy dream, proving it is possible to escape generational trauma‚Äîlove that for her. I didn‚Äôt even know she existed until I was about 8. My mom just‚Ä¶ never mentioned her. Like, straight-up Thanos-snapped her out of my awareness. One day, I was like, ‚ÄúWait, I have a sister?‚Äù and boom‚Äîfamily plot twist unlocked.

Now, here‚Äôs where it gets heavy: My mom lost a child when they were just over a year old. And listen, I get it‚Äîthat kind of grief? It changes a person. But the problem? She never actually dealt with it. Like, at all. No therapy. No healing. Just pain stuffed deep down and projected onto everyone around her. Especially us kids.

The result? My brother got elevated to ""Golden Child Supreme‚Ñ¢"" status while I... well, I got the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too much‚Äù starter pack.

I was the problem child. Or at least that‚Äôs what the family newsletter (written exclusively by my mother) always said. She‚Äôs practically a professional fiction writer the way she‚Äôs spun lies to the extended family over the years. Oscar-worthy stuff. Honestly, if she had a LinkedIn, it‚Äôd just say *Full-Time Martyr, Part-Time Truth Evader*.

Meanwhile, my ‚Äústep‚Äù father‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him Captain Closet‚Äîwas literally a closet alcoholic. I wish I were joking. He was once *discovered* drinking in a literal closet. You can‚Äôt make this up. I was the lucky target of his drunken rages. Nothing like hiding from a grown man throwing bottles to round out your childhood experience.

From there? Things spiraled. At 7, my brother SA‚Äôd me. When I was 8, I tried to end my life. The trauma was constant. He‚Äôd wake me up in the middle of the night with a knife to my throat. And when I told my parents? Nothing. Not even a blink. They gaslit, denied, and ignored me while I was begging for help.

By 10, things took a sharp nosedive‚Äîmy brother started SA me almost daily for a year, with a side of life-threatening threats for good measure. By 13, while other kids were busy gossiping about crushes or pretending to care about algebra, I got my first job. Not to save up for a new phone‚Äînah, I was out here funding my own survival. School supplies? Paid for. Lunches? Me. Activity fees? You guessed it. I was making minimum wage while dodging trauma like it was a full-time sport. I even ran away once, left a heartfelt letter begging to go into foster care. But, surprise! Crickets. Just me, some silence, and the usual routine of surviving the impossible.

Ah yes, high school graduation‚Äîa magical time when most kids are getting ‚Äúwe‚Äôre so proud of you‚Äù cards and snapping cute cap-and-gown pics. Me? I got a black eye and a bruised cheek the night before the ceremony. A real Kodak moment, if you‚Äôre into the ‚Äútrauma-core‚Äù aesthetic. No professional photos, no teary-eyed family cheering me on‚Äîjust me, strutting across the stage like a battered queen who somehow still graduated, despite years of being told I‚Äôd never amount to anything. Honestly? Iconic.

I peaced out at 18, not long after graduation, and by 19 I‚Äôd found actual refuge‚Äîaka my sister and her husband, two rare humans who understood that love doesn‚Äôt come with conditions, manipulation, or flying kitchenware. They *showed up*. They supported me. And when I got pregnant at 20, they stood by me like champs‚Äîzero drama, zero weirdness. Unlike my parents, who somehow made *my* pregnancy entirely about *them*. My mom? She kept calling my unborn son ‚Äúhers,‚Äù which should‚Äôve been the first neon-red, siren-blaring, caution-tape-wrapped flag in what would eventually become a five-alarm emotional dumpster fire. The pregnancy itself was brutal‚ÄîI nearly lost my baby at 18 weeks and had to get my cervix sewn shut (yes, sewn shut, like a haunted Build-a-Bear). And when I had a panic attack over needing a giant needle in my hip, instead of support, my mom casually told me I was going to kill my baby. Stellar motivational speech, really. Very Hallmark. Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget the cherry on top‚Äîshe thought it was somehow her business to make completely inappropriate comments about my son‚Äôs penis, *and* ask me about his father‚Äôs ‚Äúmassive shlong.‚Äù So, there‚Äôs that, too. Because nothing says ‚Äúparent of the year‚Äù like crossing all kinds of lines in one fell swoop.

And the hospital drama? Oh, buckle up. Picture this: I‚Äôm mid-labor, literally pushing a human out of my vagina like it‚Äôs the most intense marathon of my life, and my parents‚Äî*in front of my best friend*, who‚Äôs watching the whole thing like it‚Äôs a real-life soap opera‚Äîdecide that‚Äôs the perfect moment to tell the nurse I don‚Äôt want my baby and that CFS should step in because they want to adopt him. Yes, in the middle of me literally giving birth, they‚Äôre planning my child‚Äôs adoption. Because why not make a dramatic entrance into motherhood with a side of betrayal?

Then came the first few days home: sleep-deprived, drowning in baby chaos, and trying to figure out how to be a mom. Who actually stepped up to help? My sister and brother-in-law. Total heroes, no exaggeration. They were the ones holding it together while I barely could. But of course, enter *my mom*, with all her unsolicited advice. One night, my brother-in-law‚ÄîGod bless him‚Äîtold her to leave. He basically *rescued* me from the madness and sent her packing in the middle of the night. The look on her face? *Priceless.* My mom was determined to stay and ‚Äòhelp,‚Äô but my brother-in-law wasn‚Äôt having any of it. Let‚Äôs just say, that moment? Forever etched in my memory.

Fast forward through a toxic relationship, a miscarriage that my mom declared ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt real‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt need a D&C (thanks for the diagnosis, Dr. Google), and a complete breakdown that led to postpartum depression and a BPD diagnosis. My sister and her husband? They showed up. They adapted. They supported me. My parents? Well, they diagnosed me with ‚Äúmultiple personalities,‚Äù like they were auditioning for a bad Lifetime movie.

Then came 2016. Wildfire evacuation. New city. And my parents? Still saying, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt raise your son without us,‚Äù like they were the toxic support hotline I never asked for. And, because I‚Äôm a sucker for punishment, I gave in.

From 2016 to 2018, I moved back in with them. It was hell. They undermined everything I did. My parenting? Called abuse. My boundaries? Completely ignored. In 2017, my father assaulted me in front of my son, and when I called the police, they lied and told them I was unstable. Because, of course, they did.

Eventually, I got out. Again. Started over. Again. And just when I thought life might be giving me a break, my health went downhill. Hospitalized. Crohn‚Äôs. Recovery. They offered to help, and for a hot second, I thought, ‚ÄúHey, maybe things will change.‚Äù

Spoiler alert: they didn‚Äôt.

My son started struggling with behavioral issues, so I reached out to Children‚Äôs Services for help. And, boom, my parents went full villain mode. They accused me of doping my son with meds, called me a bad mom, and whipped up their usual web of lies.

And just when you think it couldn‚Äôt get worse? My parents started buying my son‚Äôs love‚Äîlike it was on sale. Gifts galore, over-the-top stuff to win him over, all while they were months behind on bills and calling everyone else financially irresponsible. Make it make sense.

Then, the cherry on top: In October 2022, I decided to have the ‚Äúheart-to-heart‚Äù conversation with my mom about my brother‚Äôs abuse. Her response? Blaming me, of course. Two weeks later, they called the cops on me when I tried to pick up my son. Because that‚Äôs totally how normal families handle things, right?

That‚Äôs when everything went from ‚Äúthis is a nightmare‚Äù to ‚Äúhold my wine, it‚Äôs about to get wild.‚Äù The manipulation tactics came out, and gaslighting became their full-time job. As a result, I took a four-month leave from work to focus on my mental health‚Äîbecause who needs a paycheck when you‚Äôre dealing with family drama? During that time, I went to therapy and realized that my relationship with my mom has really messed me up. Who knew?

All I‚Äôve ever wanted is a normal relationship with her. You know, the kind where your mom actually, like, shows up and loves you? A concept I missed out on as a kid when she emotionally ghosted me. So, I wrote her a letter. I poured my heart out and begged her to work on our relationship‚Äînot just for us, but for my son, too. And then, I had the audacity to make a decision: If she couldn‚Äôt be a mother, I had to cut her out. Because, you know, living is kind of important. And my son deserves a mom who‚Äôs alive, not stuck in a toxic loop of generational drama that makes her question her own existence everyday.

And I honest to god thought we were making progress; things were seemingly getting better. She never apologized for what they did in 2022, but ‚Äúreassured‚Äù me they had no intentions of taking my son away. But by the time September came around‚Ä¶.it went to shit.

Sadly, the ""progress"" lasted about as long as a Snapchat message. At the end of September 2023, I got SA by a coworker whom I thought was my friend. Apparently not. ¬†I confided in my mom, hoping for some support. Instead, she gave me the emotional equivalent of a shrug and tried to use my son as an excuse not to report it. My dad? Not a peep. The only people who showed any concern were my sister, brother-in-law, and a select few close friends who apparently understand how feelings work.

Between October and December of 2023, I was *struggling* with my mental health. Shocking, right? I was still in therapy, waiting to see a specialist for the fresh batch of trauma I‚Äôd acquired‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt love a little extra emotional baggage? But despite all that, I somehow managed to get a ""mentally stable"" evaluation. Go figure! Meanwhile, my father, who must have earned a medical degree during his retirement, kept telling me I wasn‚Äôt mentally stable. Apparently, saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to your child when they demand you rearrange their room at 9:30 p.m. to fit their mood qualifies you for a straitjacket. Who knew?

And there you have it, folks‚Äîthis is the backstory you didn‚Äôt know you needed but now can‚Äôt un-know. Buckle up, because now that you‚Äôve got the context, cause part two is coming!",1,1747198018.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

**Abstract:**

This article examines the sociological literature on the construction of public problems, with a particular emphasis on the mechanisms that facilitate the emergence of certain issues as public problems within society. Based on insights from sociologists in the field, it is evident that it is not the objective importance of an issue that transforms it into a public problem; rather, multiple dynamics that come into play in the societal debate, including mediatization. By synthesizing the relevant sociological literature, this article identifies key factors that contribute to the construction of public problems and underscores the potential for social movements to leverage these dynamics to achieve their goals as fast as possible.

# Societal change

# [Introduction]()

A moral agent conscious of a big injustice happening in a society has a moral obligation to act effectively to eliminate this injustice as quickly as possible. To be able to fulfill this duty of acting effectively, the moral agent must learn the sociological mechanisms that allow the elimination of an injustice in a society. In other words, the moral obligation to eliminate an injustice includes a procedural obligation to learn the mechanisms that allow the societal elimination of injustices.

It is the sociology of the social construction of public problems or the sociology of social problems that studies the process by which certain issues are identified as public problems and become the object of political action. According to sociologists, problems that become identified by society and the authorities as public problems become so not because of their objective importance, but because of some dynamics that take place in the societal debate (Becker, 1966)[\[1\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn1).

# [I.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Three dynamics by which a problem metamorphoses into a public problem]()

¬†

[a.¬†¬†¬†¬† Collective mobilization]()

The first dynamic of the process transforming an issue into a public problem is *collective mobilization*, also called ‚Äúpopular participation‚Äù by some sociologists (Cobb, 1983)[\[2\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn2). In this stage, some people who consider that an issue is a problem, start to publicly make a political claim stating that the problem has to be eliminated by the State or by a company that is blamed for the problem. Very logically, to see one day the elimination of a problem, some must beforehand claim publicly and clearly that this problem has to be eliminated. Lawyers have to put precise claims in their legal actions if they want the judge to give them what they request for their client, in the same way social actors must make a precise claim to get what they want (Felstiner, 1980, p. 636)[\[3\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn3). This claim-making can be made in link with demonstrations, violent actions, peaceful symbolic actions, petitions, letters to the editor, boycotts, strikes, etc. Mobilization aims to make the claim more visible to the public, attract attention and sympathy from the public opinion or the media, to defend publicly the claim by disseminating the arguments in favor of the claim in the public and finally to increase the number of citizens who share the political opinion of the claim to be able to make sufficient pressure to see a change (Hassenteufel, 2010, p. 51)[\[4\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn4).

¬†

# [b.¬†¬†¬†¬† Mediatization]()

¬†

The second dynamic is *mediatization*. Nowadays, without media coverage it is unlikely that an important issue will ever become a public problem and will be resolved by the authorities (Dispensa, 2003, p.90)[\[5\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn5). This is easily understood by the fact that a claim and the arguments in favor of it are much more visible to the public if they receive media coverage. Since mediatization can quickly increase the number of citizens sharing the political opinion favorable to the claim, it is extremely important in the process of social change. Therefore, moral agents seeking to eliminate an injustice should carefully study the factors that help to increase media coverage surrounding an issue.

¬†

# [c.¬†¬†¬†¬† Politicization]()

¬†

The last dynamic is *politicization*. It refers to the stage where some authority or political person puts finally the issue on the political agenda with the objective of producing a decision that will eliminate the problem (Hassenteufel, 2010, p. 53)[\[6\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn6). According to Kingdon (1984), a problem must first be on the governmental agenda to be put on the political agenda and produce a political decision for its elimination. What Kingdon (1984) calls the ‚Äúgovernmental agenda‚Äù is what integrates all the subjects to which people in and around government are paying serious attention (Kingdon, 1984, p. 143)[\[7\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn7). These objects are often the ones that are regularly covered by the media.

In a more graphic way, Kingdon (1984) explains that to generate a political decision three streams are at play.

The first stream is the *problem stream*. An issue must be picked from the available *problem stream* where swim all the problems to which the government pays attention. Three main mechanisms capture the attention of public authorities so that it appears in the ‚Äúproblem stream‚Äù:

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† indicators (i.e. polls or statistical measures which are often mediatized),

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† policy milestones (i.e. crisis which are often covered by the media),

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† feedback effects (i.e. information, in the context of an evaluation in particular, about policy failures which are also mediatized).

The second stream is the *policy stream*. It corresponds to the available policy solutions that can be easily adopted. These solutions must meet the criteria of technical feasibility, their compatibility with prevailing values and their capacity to anticipate future constraints.

Finally, the *political stream*, which integrates the public opinion of the moment, the actual organized political forces (political parties in particular), the executive branch (sometimes its recent change) and the possibilities of political collective bargaining, gives sometimes rise to a political opportunity for an authority or a politician to take action. Only the joining of these three streams can generate a political decision centered on the elimination of the problem (Kingdon, 1984, p. 178).

# [II.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† How social movements can influence these dynamics to increase their chances of success]()



# [a.¬†¬†¬†¬† Collective mobilization]()

# [i.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Expressing the claim]()



As stated above, the collective mobilization dynamic is the one where social actors make publicly a political claim. We have seen that a problem has very little chance to be eliminated if nobody claims for its elimination. Applied to the problem of killing animals for simple food habits, this means that to see one day this practice eliminated there must first be people who express the political claim that this practice has to be forbidden.

¬†

# [ii.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Choosing the strategical arguments for the claim]()



During collective mobilization, not only a claim is made but are also disseminated in the public the arguments supporting it. To be efficient in attracting the sympathy of as many citizens as possible as well as of the media, social movements have to choose carefully the arguments they use to defend the claim. Chateauraynaud (2011)[\[8\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn8) explains that to be effective, the arguments must be directly related to commonly shared principles in the society. Commonly shared principles play the role of a cognitive filter: only those claims that enter in this filter can be easily accepted by the public.¬† Citizens must be able to link the claim to a general known principle, so that the demand sounds like the continuation of something already existent. A good argument for a claim is the one that produces the insertion of the other's point of view into a known structure. In other words, to be understood by the public as easily as possible and to create as many citizens as possible sharing the political opinion favorable to the claim, an argument has to take its origin in commonly shared moral principles. If we apply these principles, the claim ‚Äúkilling animals for simple food habits has to be banned‚Äù, could be defended by an argument like the following: Our society's principles of nonviolence and protection of the weak demand that we end the barbaric practices of slaughterhouses, where countless innocent animals are killed daily despite viable, humane plant-based alternatives. By aligning our social practices with our principles, we can transform slaughterhouses from symbols of injustice into relics of a less enlightened past. That is why the act of killing animals for simple food habits must be penalized.‚Äù

¬†

# [iii.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Choosing the mode of the collective mobilization]()



To be effective, social movements have to choose the mode of collective mobilization that has the biggest chances to make the authorities to accept their claims. It is therefore a moral obligation for them to know what researchers say on this subject.

In a study, after analyzing hundreds of violent and non-violent resistance campaigns, Chenoweth (2011) showed that non-violent campaigns succeed in 53% of cases while campaigns that use violence succeed in only 26% of cases, for campaigns that use terrorism the success rate is only 9%[\[9\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn9). The researchers working on this issue, instead of determining what is objectively violence or terrorism, base their analysis only on what is *perceived* as ‚Äúviolent‚Äù or ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù.

Abrahms (2006) states that no matter what are the real policy demands of the movements using terrorism, their mode of action generates the belief that their objectives are maximalist and dissuades the authorities to make any concessions[\[10\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn10).

Regarding the perception of the first Palestinian intifada, Kaufman (1991)[\[11\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn11) found that while only 15% of the demonstrations during the Intifada were violent (the majority of the latter consisted only of throwing rocks on Israeli Defense forces of the territories), 80% of Israelis perceived that the means used by the protests were ‚Äúmainly violent‚Äù and 93% believed that the Intifada was ‚Äúdirected both towards civilians than towards the army‚Äù. More interestingly, while the first objective of the Intifada was ‚Äúto communicate to Israelis the need to end the occupation of the territories‚Äù, Kaufman (1991) found that 66% of Israelis thought that the intifada was directed ‚Äúagainst the existence of the state of Israel‚Äù.

This is just one example highlighting the results found by Chenoweth (2011) and showing that the more a movement is perceived to be violent the more it creates the impression that the movement has extremist goals that shouldn‚Äôt be adopted by society.

In another study (Feinberg, 2020)[\[12\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn12) where were compared the consequences of different kinds of actions¬† on the perception of two different groups regarding the same cause and coming from the same movement, it is shown that movement actions that are perceived as ""extreme"" or ""immoral"" by the public generate less public support for the movement. In this study, Feinberg (2020), explains this by saying that when a movement uses ‚Äúextreme protest actions‚Äù, this creates a perception of the immorality of the protest actions which generates decreased emotional connection and identification with the actors of the movement, which in turn creates less movement support. What is interesting is that one of the cases tested on subjects was an animal rights protest. Approximately 300 participants were recruited to test the case. They were separated in three different groups. Each of the groups learned that they would read a transcript from a news broadcast and answer questions about it afterward:

  
‚Äúparticipants read about a fictional animal rights activist organization called Free the Vulnerable (FTV). The extremity of the movement‚Äôs protest behavior was manipulated at three levels: Moderate Protest, Extreme Protest, or Highly Extreme Protest conditions. The protesters in the two extreme protest conditions engaged in unlawful activities (e.g., breaking into an animal testing facility) modeled after protest activities of real-life social movement activists, with the protesters in the Highly Extreme Protest condition engaging in particularly disruptive and harmful behaviors (e.g., drugging a security guard \[as well as freeing animals kept in the lab and destroying property\]) compared to the protesters in the Extreme Protest condition (e.g., sneaking past the security guard \[and freeing animals from the lab without destroying any property\]). By contrast, in the Moderate Protest condition the activists marched peacefully expressing their demands. Including two extreme protest conditions allowed us to explore competing possibilities regarding the extreme protests‚Äô effects on observers‚Äô support for a movement. On the one hand, observers may base their level of support directly on how extreme the protest actions are, and therefore protest extremity would have a linear impact on bystanders‚Äô support. On the other hand, there might be a threshold of extremity beyond which bystanders‚Äô impressions do not get more negative.‚Äù (Feinberg, 2020, p. 1101).[\[13\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn13)

After reading what they thought was a transcript from a news broadcast, participants indicated how extreme they thought the protest was, how much they socially identified with members of the movement, how much they supported the protesters, how willing they were to join the movement and how much they supported the movements‚Äô overarching cause.

The results showed first that participants in both the Extreme Protest and the Highly Extreme Protest conditions viewed the protesters‚Äô behavior as more extreme than did participants in the Moderate Protest condition. Additionally, participants in the Highly Extreme Protest condition viewed the protesters‚Äô behavior as being more extreme than participants in the Extreme Protest condition. Participants in the the Moderate Protest condition, supported the protesters more, were more likely to join the movement, and were more supportive of the movements overarching cause. But despite the fact that participants in the Highly Extreme Protest condition viewed the protesters‚Äô behavior as being more extreme than participants in the Extreme Protest condition, researchers found non-significant differences between the other answers of the Extreme and Highly Extreme Protest conditions. In accordance with the threshold hypothesis, the researchers concluded:

‚ÄúThus, while protesters in the Extreme Protest condition were viewed as significantly less extreme than those in the Highly Extreme Protest condition, they were judged in a similar light. This result is in line with research arguing that the perceived inappropriateness of many acts does not occur linearly, but as a step function, where behaviors that cross a given threshold are categorized in a similarly negative manner (Alexander, 2008).‚Äù (Feinberg, 2020, p. 1101).

  
Since the conditions of Extreme Protect Action were only in the illegal entry in the building and the illegal saving of the animals without any vandalizing or damage to property and that the answers of the participants in this condition weren‚Äôt much better than in the condition of Highly Extreme Protect Action where the drugging of a security guard and damage to property were involved, it means that the simple fact that animal activists do something illegal (without causing any direct damage to someone‚Äôs physical integrity or property) can be sufficient to produce the same negative results as if the activists did drug a human being and damaged private property. According to the results of this study, we may think that the Animal Liberation Front‚Äôs opposition to all forms of bodily integrity violations (but its acceptance of damage to property, which is already worse than the Extreme Protest Action Condition in the Feinberg study) may not mean any reduction in the negative consequences of their actions in the eyes of the public. Moreover, despite their ethical principles, animal activists engaging in destructive direct action are still labeled as terrorists (Pos≈Çuszna, 2020, p. 3)[\[14\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn14).

As one of the aims of collective mobilization is to persuade the biggest number possible of citizens to adopt the political opinions favorable to their claims, social movements have to choose strategically their mode of collective mobilization.

Like it has been noted before, campaigns perceived as violent by the public have two times less chances to succeed than those perceived as non-violent, while those perceived as using terrorism have 6 times less chances to succeed.

But the perception of the actions is produced by media framing which we will examine now.

# [b.¬†¬†¬†¬† Mediatization]()

We have seen above that an issue has very little chances to be put on the political agenda if it doesn‚Äôt receive media coverage. The mediatization is therefore a very important dynamic helping to transform a problem into a public problem. We will examine precisely this topic, especially regarding the concept of *framing*, before explaining what social movements can do to increase their chances of success regarding this important dynamic.

It is been a long time that researchers working on the media say similar things about the media:

They are constantly presenting objects suggesting what individuals in the mass should think about, know about, have feelings about. (Lang, 1966, p. 468)[\[15\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn15)

Mccombs (1972, p. 184) suggested also an agenda-setting function of the mass media[\[16\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn16). This function manifests notably through the selection of issues considered as worthy of interest by the media and through the framing of these issues.

[i.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Choosing angles of newsworthiness]()

Research on *news values*, *newsworthiness* and *gatekeeping* done by journalists is useful to understand some of the factors that the media uses to decide whether a subject is newsworthy or not.

Sociologists have made lists of criteria stating that to receive media coverage an issue must satisfy at least with one or more of them. One list of Harcup & O‚ÄôNeill (2017) includes the following:

‚ÄúExclusivity: Stories generated by, or available first to, the news organization as a result of interviews, letters, investigations, surveys, polls, and so on.

Bad news: Stories with particularly negative overtones such as death, injury, defeat and loss (of a job, for example).

Conflict: Stories concerning conflict such as controversies, arguments, splits, strikes, fights, insurrections and warfare.

Surprise: Stories that have an element of surprise, contrast and/or the unusual about them.

Audio-visuals: Stories that have arresting photographs, video, audio and/or which can be illustrated with infographics.

Shareability: Stories that are thought likely to generate sharing and comments via Facebook, Twitter and other forms of social media.

Entertainment: Soft stories concerning sex, showbusiness, sport, lighter human interest, animals, or offering opportunities for humorous treatment, witty headlines or lists.

Drama: Stories concerning an unfolding drama such as escapes, accidents, searches, sieges, rescues, battles or court cases.

Follow-up: Stories about subjects already in the news.

The power elite: Stories concerning powerful individuals, organizations, institutions or corporations.

Relevance: Stories about groups or nations perceived to be influential with, or culturally or historically familiar to, the audience.

Magnitude: Stories perceived as sufficiently significant in the large numbers of people involved or in potential impact, or involving a degree of extreme behavior or extreme occurrence.

Celebrity: Stories concerning people who are already famous.

Good news: Stories with particularly positive overtones such as recoveries, breakthroughs, cures, wins and celebrations.

News organization‚Äôs agenda: Stories that set or fit the news organization‚Äôs own agenda, whether ideological, commercial or as part of a specific campaign.‚Äù (Harcup & O‚ÄôNeill, 2017)[\[17\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn17)

According to this, if social actors want to increase the news coverage of an issue, social movements can present it through one or more of these angles to journalists.

¬†

[ii.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Creating contacts with the gatekeepers]()

Regarding *gatekeeping,* Clayman (1992) says the following:

‚ÄúGatekeeping, as a social scientific concept, can be traced to Lewin's (1947) writings on social planning. He observed that the most efficient way to bring about widespread social change is to concentrate on persons in key positions of influence, who function as ""gatekeepers"" in the flow of goods and ideas through the society.‚Äù[\[18\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn18)

Therefore, another excellent way to increase media coverage is to create contacts with some journalists who detain the power of deciding if an issue will become news. It is possible for example for the representatives of an NGO to ask to meet once a journalist around a cup of coffee to talk about their work and future events that can interest the newspaper ‚Äúin order to see if it would be possible in the future to provide their newspaper with exclusive information regarding the planned activities‚Äù. During the meeting it is possible to ask the journalists about advices regarding what are the criteria that help a subject / event related to their cause to be seen as newsworthy. The simple fact of meeting this journalist will create a personal contact that may help to get more media coverage in the future.

[*iii.*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Moving from stigmatization to celebration]()

A study showed that vegans were a decade ago often stigmatized by the media coverage in the United Kingdom (Cole & Morgan, 2011)[\[19\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn19). Similar results were obtained regarding media coverage of vegan in Australia (Masterman-Smith, Ragusa, & Crampton, 2014).[\[20\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn20) However, in the recent years vegans‚Äô image in the British press has been transformed from a stigmatised lifestyle to a normalized and healthy diet in particular through the mediatization of vegan celebrities (Lundahl, 2020).[\[21\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn21) This is surely good news and gives the idea that something similar can be done regarding the image of ‚Äúanimal activists‚Äù. The animal rights movement could invite celebrities advocating for the animals to animal rights events to do for example discourses or to be the first signatories of petitions that can be mediatized. Such an association with celebrities in the media has the potential to transform the libel of ‚Äúanimal activist‚Äù into something much more positive.

[iv.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Avoiding negative framings and creating positive ones]()

Regarding the *framing* done by the media, Entman (1993, p. 52) says the following:

To frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation.[\[22\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn22)

Because of the framing process, if a demonstration is presented by the media as a confrontation between police and demonstrators, ‚Äúthe protesters‚Äô critique may not be part of the story ‚Äì not because there wasn‚Äôt room for it, but because it was not defined as relevant‚Äù (Reese, 2001, p. 8).[\[23\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn23)

# [v.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Taking into account the depth of frames]()

¬†

Frames not only shape the presentation of an individual story but can have lasting consequences on our ways to perceive some issues:

more ‚Äúcultural‚Äù frames don‚Äôt stop with organizing one story, but invite us to marshal a cultural understanding and keep on doing so beyond the immediate information. These are the ‚Äústrategic‚Äù frames that speak to a broader way to account for social reality (Reese, 2001, p. 12).[\[24\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn24)

Some sociologists distinguish frames according to their ‚Äúdepth‚Äù: *deep* frames are more general and often older and *shallow* frames are specific and often more recent (Wolfsfeld, G., 1997).[\[25\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn25) The frame ‚ÄúCold War‚Äù is for example deeper than ‚Äúunprovoked attack‚Äù (Reese, 2001, p. 12) and the frame ‚Äúanimal rights extremism‚Äù is deeper than ‚Äúsabotage of a slaughterhouse‚Äù. Some elements of an issue can remind the public of an old and deep frame and produce in their mind the insertion of the issue in this old frame. We can make the hypothesis that the threshold in the study of Feinberg (2020) seen above related to extreme protest actions, after the crossing of which, the consequences of some modes of collective mobilization are similarly negative is linked to the frame ‚Äúanimal rights extremism‚Äù that was sustained by the media and that is now known and used by many citizens to categorize animal rights actions as soon as they involve illegality.

¬†

# [vi.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Avoiding two negative frames]()

¬†

If social movements want to be effective, they must avoid the possibility for the media and the public to insert their actions in a frame that has negative consequences for their cause.

To avoid the frame of ‚Äúanimal rights extremism‚Äù, this may imply the necessity of highlighting in a press release that the organized action was / will be totally peaceful and was / will be organized by a serious NGO some of the interesting works of which can be presented in the end of the press release. Ensuring that the visual aspects of an event (important element for media coverage) like banners and signs help to avoid a negative framing can also be useful.

Another framing is also usually used by the media regarding people who oppose the violence inflicted upon animals. When there is media coverage about veganism or vegans, it is generally framed it as a ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù issue. Because of this framing, the issue of the elimination of the killing animals for simple food habits is therefore constructed not as a question of justice that needs to be addressed by the society and the authorities, but as a simple question of personal choice. This makes the political aspect of the problem totally invisible and ensures that any media appearance of vegans is absolutely innocuous for the problem that animal activists want to eliminate. Given that even activists are influenced by the media, it is not always easy even for them to think outside the usual media frames portraying animal people either as militant extremists or as inoffensive vegans just sharing recipes. To avoid the frame ‚Äúanimal rights extremism‚Äù that has negative consequences as well as the frame ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù that has also very bad consequences since it transforms an important question of justice into a benign question of personal choice, animal activists have not only to make sure that they are seen as peaceful but also have to make their political claim visible for example when they talk to the journalist or with visual aspects like for example inscriptions on clothing like ‚Äúour society has to respect the lives of the animals‚Äù. To make it impossible for the media to ignore the political claims of an event, it is possible to put the claim or part of it directly in the name of the event like ‚Äúkindness to end speciesism festival‚Äù or ‚Äúmarch for the closure of slaughterhouses‚Äù. Also, highlighting in a press release that a demonstration isn‚Äôt composed of vegans but of all people who have the political claim that our society should one day respect the lives of all animals, and explaining in it that the event isn‚Äôt about the consumption practice of consumers but about the political opinions of citizens may help to make the political claim of the movement become more visible in the media. Indeed, it is easier for people to share the political opinion of someone to whom they can identify, and it is easier for nonvegans to share the political opinion of end of killing animals for simple food habits if they can identify with other nonvegans who have this political opinion.



# [vii. Implementing two new positive frames]()

¬†

Media often frames animal agriculture as an *economic and social issue*, rather than as a major *ethical and environmental issue*. Animal activists have to act to change that by expressing clearly that it is a major ethical issue and highlighting in their communications that we have to take into account the fact that the quasi unanimity of moral philosophers, our society‚Äôs specialists of ethics, who have worked on our relation to other animals consider that the practice of killing animals for simple food habits is wrong and should be eliminated (to highlight this fact, animal activists can use in their communications the ‚ÄúMontreal declaration on animal exploitation‚Äù signed by around 550 academics)[\[26\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn26).

¬†

Animal activists also have to express that animal agriculture is a major environmental issue by informing that according to scientific studies, like the one from Eisen & Brown (2022), the gradual cessation of animal agriculture, over a period of 15 years from today, would lead to the neutralization of global warming over the period 2030-2060, which means in other words, that it would totally offset the warming effect of all other human greenhouse gas emissions over this period[\[27\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn27). The social actors can be successful in changing the framing surrounding animal agriculture, since there are nowadays more newspaper articles that are critical towards meat consumption (Mroz, 2022)[\[28\]](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=a3fa875fbf&view=lg&permmsgid=msg-a:r3083132482378431006&ser=1#m_5838461039705874468__ftn28).

¬†

# [c.¬†¬†¬†¬† Politicization]()

¬†

Choosing strategical arguments for a claim so that the public opinion is more likely to support it and paying attention to the framing of the problem so that the subject is mediatized favorably in newspapers, are not ends in themselves but help the problem to be put on the governmental agenda (which is the agenda that integrates the problems to which the media pays attention).

What helps the issue to be put on the governmental agenda is also the concrete availability of solutions to eliminate the problem. To be effective a claim should be already expressing what kind of solutions have to be put in place. And ideally focusing on the solution that is the easiest to be put in place by the politicians regarding public pressure and political forces. For example if animal activists want the end of the killing of animals be concretized in law, they should claim not for a legal right to live for the animals but for the creation of a criminal offense that makes it subjected to a fine to kill animals for simple food habits. Since at the end, all problems are eliminated in the law, activists have to request the help of lawyers who are sympathetic to their cause to know how to frame their claim so that it focuses on the easiest legal change to be made to see their problem eliminated. It should be also a good idea to ask parliamentarians sympathetic to their cause which is be the best moment to bring up their issue in the parliament with a petition or another political initiative. If they want to ask parliamentarians to defend their cause in the parliament, they should check which are the actual political forces after an election and ask to politicians who are the more likely to gather the support of the majority. After a new election, it can be a good idea to make their issue heard in the parliament, so that the new elected politicians see that their cause is discussed in the parliament. Activists have to know that a political or legal decision that doesn‚Äôt eliminate their problem can be an opportunity to mediatize the issue again and to make circulate in the society the arguments in favor of their claim and sometimes showing that the institution didn‚Äôt act in a required way to address their problem correctly. This new mediatization of the issue, made easier by the existence of a new institutional decision to which the media generally pays attention, will help to increase the support to their cause in the public opinion which is very good to change the cultural norm in favor of their cause and which will help us in the future initiatives. All social movements had to make the same requests several times, to have their problems eliminated. After each discussion, their arguments are more shared and understood which already changes the culture and makes more citizens in favor of their political claim.

Part One:

Okay, so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not totally sure what I expect from posting this. Maybe I just need to finally say it out loud (or, you know, type it out dramatically on Reddit like a sleep-deprived raccoon with unresolved trauma). Closure would be cool. Healing would be even better. Or maybe I just want someone out there to go, ‚ÄúDamn, yeah, that‚Äôs messed up.‚Äù

Anyway, here's the deal: my story isn‚Äôt sunshine and rainbows. There are some definite triggers. It‚Äôs not short, either. But it‚Äôs mine‚Äîand it‚Äôs real.

I wish I could just jump straight into the dumpster fire that was (and still is) my life since 2024, but for any of it to make sense, we need to rewind a bit. Don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt turn this into a novel‚Ä¶ unless someone knows a publisher, then maybe.

What I‚Äôll say right away is this: I have regrets‚Äîmany of them. But one of the deepest is allowing toxic, manipulative, and abusive family members to remain in my life for far too long. I‚Äôm only sharing a few of the heavier, key details here‚Äînot everything. Names have been deliberately left out, for obvious reasons‚Äîone of the biggest being that this is still an active matter in court.

Grab some wine, tequila, or whatever your poison of choice is, because you‚Äôll need it to survive this hot mess of family drama.

So hey, I‚Äôm a thirty-something single mom to an 11-year-old who somehow manages to be both the reason I haven't completely lost it and the reason I drink way too much iced coffee. My life? Complicated. My resume? Survivor of chaos.

My mom? A divorcee and a survivor of domestic abuse. Respect there, honestly. But then came husband #3‚Äîaka my ""stepdad""‚Äîwho adopted me and my older brother. Cool move on paper, right? But, uh‚Ä¶ just wait.

I have an older sister (different dad, same family drama) who's out here living the married-to-a-great-guy dream, proving it is possible to escape generational trauma‚Äîlove that for her. I didn‚Äôt even know she existed until I was about 8. My mom just‚Ä¶ never mentioned her. Like, straight-up Thanos-snapped her out of my awareness. One day, I was like, ‚ÄúWait, I have a sister?‚Äù and boom‚Äîfamily plot twist unlocked.

Now, here‚Äôs where it gets heavy: My mom lost a child when they were just over a year old. And listen, I get it‚Äîthat kind of grief? It changes a person. But the problem? She never actually dealt with it. Like, at all. No therapy. No healing. Just pain stuffed deep down and projected onto everyone around her. Especially us kids.

The result? My brother got elevated to ""Golden Child Supreme‚Ñ¢"" status while I... well, I got the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too much‚Äù starter pack.

I was the problem child. Or at least that‚Äôs what the family newsletter (written exclusively by my mother) always said. She‚Äôs practically a professional fiction writer the way she‚Äôs spun lies to the extended family over the years. Oscar-worthy stuff. Honestly, if she had a LinkedIn, it‚Äôd just say *Full-Time Martyr, Part-Time Truth Evader*.

Meanwhile, my ‚Äústep‚Äù father‚Äîlet‚Äôs call him Captain Closet‚Äîwas literally a closet alcoholic. I wish I were joking. He was once *discovered* drinking in a literal closet. You can‚Äôt make this up. I was the lucky target of his drunken rages. Nothing like hiding from a grown man throwing bottles to round out your childhood experience.

From there? Things spiraled. At 7, my brother SA‚Äôd me. When I was 8, I tried to end my life. The trauma was constant. He‚Äôd wake me up in the middle of the night with a knife to my throat. And when I told my parents? Nothing. Not even a blink. They gaslit, denied, and ignored me while I was begging for help.

By 10, things took a sharp nosedive‚Äîmy brother started SA me almost daily for a year, with a side of life-threatening threats for good measure. By 13, while other kids were busy gossiping about crushes or pretending to care about algebra, I got my first job. Not to save up for a new phone‚Äînah, I was out here funding my own survival. School supplies? Paid for. Lunches? Me. Activity fees? You guessed it. I was making minimum wage while dodging trauma like it was a full-time sport. I even ran away once, left a heartfelt letter begging to go into foster care. But, surprise! Crickets. Just me, some silence, and the usual routine of surviving the impossible.

Ah yes, high school graduation‚Äîa magical time when most kids are getting ‚Äúwe‚Äôre so proud of you‚Äù cards and snapping cute cap-and-gown pics. Me? I got a black eye and a bruised cheek the night before the ceremony. A real Kodak moment, if you‚Äôre into the ‚Äútrauma-core‚Äù aesthetic. No professional photos, no teary-eyed family cheering me on‚Äîjust me, strutting across the stage like a battered queen who somehow still graduated, despite years of being told I‚Äôd never amount to anything. Honestly? Iconic.

I peaced out at 18, not long after graduation, and by 19 I‚Äôd found actual refuge‚Äîaka my sister and her husband, two rare humans who understood that love doesn‚Äôt come with conditions, manipulation, or flying kitchenware. They *showed up*. They supported me. And when I got pregnant at 20, they stood by me like champs‚Äîzero drama, zero weirdness. Unlike my parents, who somehow made *my* pregnancy entirely about *them*. My mom? She kept calling my unborn son ‚Äúhers,‚Äù which should‚Äôve been the first neon-red, siren-blaring, caution-tape-wrapped flag in what would eventually become a five-alarm emotional dumpster fire. The pregnancy itself was brutal‚ÄîI nearly lost my baby at 18 weeks and had to get my cervix sewn shut (yes, sewn shut, like a haunted Build-a-Bear). And when I had a panic attack over needing a giant needle in my hip, instead of support, my mom casually told me I was going to kill my baby. Stellar motivational speech, really. Very Hallmark. Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget the cherry on top‚Äîshe thought it was somehow her business to make completely inappropriate comments about my son‚Äôs penis, *and* ask me about his father‚Äôs ‚Äúmassive shlong.‚Äù So, there‚Äôs that, too. Because nothing says ‚Äúparent of the year‚Äù like crossing all kinds of lines in one fell swoop.

And the hospital drama? Oh, buckle up. Picture this: I‚Äôm mid-labor, literally pushing a human out of my vagina like it‚Äôs the most intense marathon of my life, and my parents‚Äî*in front of my best friend*, who‚Äôs watching the whole thing like it‚Äôs a real-life soap opera‚Äîdecide that‚Äôs the perfect moment to tell the nurse I don‚Äôt want my baby and that CFS should step in because they want to adopt him. Yes, in the middle of me literally giving birth, they‚Äôre planning my child‚Äôs adoption. Because why not make a dramatic entrance into motherhood with a side of betrayal?

Then came the first few days home: sleep-deprived, drowning in baby chaos, and trying to figure out how to be a mom. Who actually stepped up to help? My sister and brother-in-law. Total heroes, no exaggeration. They were the ones holding it together while I barely could. But of course, enter *my mom*, with all her unsolicited advice. One night, my brother-in-law‚ÄîGod bless him‚Äîtold her to leave. He basically *rescued* me from the madness and sent her packing in the middle of the night. The look on her face? *Priceless.* My mom was determined to stay and ‚Äòhelp,‚Äô but my brother-in-law wasn‚Äôt having any of it. Let‚Äôs just say, that moment? Forever etched in my memory.

Fast forward through a toxic relationship, a miscarriage that my mom declared ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt real‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt need a D&C (thanks for the diagnosis, Dr. Google), and a complete breakdown that led to postpartum depression and a BPD diagnosis. My sister and her husband? They showed up. They adapted. They supported me. My parents? Well, they diagnosed me with ‚Äúmultiple personalities,‚Äù like they were auditioning for a bad Lifetime movie.

Then came 2016. Wildfire evacuation. New city. And my parents? Still saying, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt raise your son without us,‚Äù like they were the toxic support hotline I never asked for. And, because I‚Äôm a sucker for punishment, I gave in.

From 2016 to 2018, I moved back in with them. It was hell. They undermined everything I did. My parenting? Called abuse. My boundaries? Completely ignored. In 2017, my father assaulted me in front of my son, and when I called the police, they lied and told them I was unstable. Because, of course, they did.

Eventually, I got out. Again. Started over. Again. And just when I thought life might be giving me a break, my health went downhill. Hospitalized. Crohn‚Äôs. Recovery. They offered to help, and for a hot second, I thought, ‚ÄúHey, maybe things will change.‚Äù

Spoiler alert: they didn‚Äôt.

My son started struggling with behavioral issues, so I reached out to Children‚Äôs Services for help. And, boom, my parents went full villain mode. They accused me of doping my son with meds, called me a bad mom, and whipped up their usual web of lies.

And just when you think it couldn‚Äôt get worse? My parents started buying my son‚Äôs love‚Äîlike it was on sale. Gifts galore, over-the-top stuff to win him over, all while they were months behind on bills and calling everyone else financially irresponsible. Make it make sense.

Then, the cherry on top: In October 2022, I decided to have the ‚Äúheart-to-heart‚Äù conversation with my mom about my brother‚Äôs abuse. Her response? Blaming me, of course. Two weeks later, they called the cops on me when I tried to pick up my son. Because that‚Äôs totally how normal families handle things, right?

That‚Äôs when everything went from ‚Äúthis is a nightmare‚Äù to ‚Äúhold my wine, it‚Äôs about to get wild.‚Äù The manipulation tactics came out, and gaslighting became their full-time job. As a result, I took a four-month leave from work to focus on my mental health‚Äîbecause who needs a paycheck when you‚Äôre dealing with family drama? During that time, I went to therapy and realized that my relationship with my mom has really messed me up. Who knew?

All I‚Äôve ever wanted is a normal relationship with her. You know, the kind where your mom actually, like, shows up and loves you? A concept I missed out on as a kid when she emotionally ghosted me. So, I wrote her a letter. I poured my heart out and begged her to work on our relationship‚Äînot just for us, but for my son, too. And then, I had the audacity to make a decision: If she couldn‚Äôt be a mother, I had to cut her out. Because, you know, living is kind of important. And my son deserves a mom who‚Äôs alive, not stuck in a toxic loop of generational drama that makes her question her own existence everyday.

And I honest to god thought we were making progress; things were seemingly getting better. She never apologized for what they did in 2022, but ‚Äúreassured‚Äù me they had no intentions of taking my son away. But by the time September came around‚Ä¶.it went to shit.

Sadly, the ""progress"" lasted about as long as a Snapchat message. At the end of September 2023, I got SA by a coworker whom I thought was my friend. Apparently not. ¬†I confided in my mom, hoping for some support. Instead, she gave me the emotional equivalent of a shrug and tried to use my son as an excuse not to report it. My dad? Not a peep. The only people who showed any concern were my sister, brother-in-law, and a select few close friends who apparently understand how feelings work.

Between October and December of 2023, I was *struggling* with my mental health. Shocking, right? I was still in therapy, waiting to see a specialist for the fresh batch of trauma I‚Äôd acquired‚Äîbecause who doesn‚Äôt love a little extra emotional baggage? But despite all that, I somehow managed to get a ""mentally stable"" evaluation. Go figure! Meanwhile, my father, who must have earned a medical degree during his retirement, kept telling me I wasn‚Äôt mentally stable. Apparently, saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to your child when they demand you rearrange their room at 9:30 p.m. to fit their mood qualifies you for a straitjacket. Who knew?

I did the calculations several times because I couldn't believe it and it's real. With this realization we've put in our budget a $75/month eating out deal.

My last relationship was with a man who has deep-seated anger issues, horrendous impulse control, unmanaged AHDH/potentially borderline personality disorder, the emotional regulation capacity of a toddler, a childhood experiencing verbal, emotional, and physical abuse from his parents (especially his mom, who also has insane unmanaged impulse control issues), all of which he normalized. On top of this, he also has significant PTSD from traumatic events related to his health, and multiple serious chronic health problems.

He would verbally and emotionally abuse me, scream at me, call me the most horrific names, throw things around me, punch walls, break things, give me the silent treatment, throw my stuff out of the bedroom, break up/threaten to leave me, attempt to abandon me in unfamiliar places, and basically just use me as an emotional punching bag every time he couldn‚Äôt regulate his emotions. This would be triggered by very minor things, such as me asking him to use the computer that I had purchased (which I had let him use), not eating the fat on my steak, leaking a couple drops of period blood on the sheets by accident, being late to get coffee with him because I was having a migraine, forgetting a receipt when we went to the store, etc. It got to the point where I was waking on eggshells and terrified he would blow up at me. He would blow up, apologize, promise to never do it again, say he would change/get help, then do it again. Over and over again. I was so deeply in love and trauma bonded to him that I wanted so desperately for him to change, heal, calm down, fix his mental state, and to stop abusing me. I was on the verge of a physical and mental breakdown when I finally left and told him I needed to take a break. And I‚Äôve been single in limbo, not dating anyone else, still texting him sometimes, still missing him ever since then.

He is so hard to figure out. On one hand he can be the most loving, incredible person who I‚Äôve shared the best memories with. But he can also turn into somewhat of a monster when he‚Äôs angry. He‚Äôs basically like an adult toddler, and I think something is deeply wrong with his brain which makes him unable to control his emotions. It‚Äôs like a mental disability. He blames the abusive outbursts on his ADHD (which his mom has too), but I think it‚Äôs more than that.

Is this man just permanently broken? Are there some men who are just too broken and f**ked up to ever be capable of respectful loving relationships? Despite all the shit he‚Äôs put me through, there‚Äôs a huge part of me that still is madly in love with him and would take him back in a heartbeat if only I could know he would never abuse me again.

You know, the usual: meditate for like 10 minutes, do a quick workout, and avoid scrolling through my phone the moment I wake up.

This whole setup is ideally making me more zen and productive... except for one tiny hiccup. I can't seem to give up the first cup of coffee. That aroma just pulls me, and before I know it, I'm sipping on it every morning thinking ""just one more week,"" but weeks roll into months... ugh. 

Here's the kicker: I know from digging into habit psychology (and a few late-night rabbit holes) that cues and rewards are a big deal. The coffee is definitely a cue that tells my brain it's time to gear up for the day, I guess. But it also makes me a bit jittery, so it's kinda counterproductive. And yet...there's that comforting routine aspect.

Might be just a mental tug-of-war thing. Trying to replace this coffee fix with something less caffeinated, maybe matcha or something soothing, but it's easier said than done.

This was no longer Liam‚Äôs room although it did still have the layout minus all his things. The bed was still propped up on two bookshelves leaving a small space underneath. On top of the bed two girls laid curled in each other's arms. Amber‚Äôs eyes slowly rolled open as she tried to move her arm. It was crushed under Kim‚Äôs body facing away from her. Amber almost couldn‚Äôt believe the beautiful body laying next to her. It was all too much for her to handle. Amber‚Äôs eyes sparkled with ideas only for Kim to shuffle awake. Kim turned over eying her sleeping partner. 

‚ÄúGood morning beautiful.‚Äù Kim‚Äôs words pulled Amber‚Äôs face forward. Kim just pushed Amber‚Äôs head down into the bed as she kissed her face all over. Butterflies fought for freedom in Amber‚Äôs tummy as she took her kissing. ‚ÄúShit, I have to get dressed.‚Äù Amber rested her head in her palm watching Kim rush to the floor as she gathered her clothes together. Amber could happily lay in this bed all day.

‚ÄúKim! You up yet?‚Äù It was Brian outside her door. Kim through a shirt and Amber trying to rush her out the window. Kim told Brian she was getting dressed as she pushed Amber out the window. Amber crouched in the cold morning air as she shimmied over to her window. She climbed through her window falling face first onto the floor in front of a pair of legs. Amber pulled up her eyes scanning her sister looking down at her. Sam just shook her head. 

‚ÄúYou have fun last night?‚Äù Sam's question came with no answer as Amber jumped into her bed. Amber crawled to the other side poping out from under her blanket and she grabbed a pair of pants off the floor. Amber scanned looking for a specific shirt. She crawled to the floor opening her dresser. She threw out clothes looking for her favorite shirt. ‚ÄúWhat are you looking for?‚Äù Sam just laid in bed watching her as a knock hit the door. 

‚ÄúI'm alone!‚Äù Amber just shouted without thinking. ‚ÄúI mean, me and Sam are alone!‚Äù Amber tried to put her whole fist in her mouth as she moved to the door. The door opened slightly as Kim pushed her head in. 

‚ÄúYou forgot your phone.‚Äù As Kim handed Amber her phone she grabbed her by the collar pulling her in to a kiss that froze time with passion only to resume time as she  shove her back before closing the door. Amber just stood dazed as Sam just watched this all play out before her. Sam just started making kisses faces taunting her sister as hung upside down off her bed. Amber just waited patiently for her angel to return. 

Kim followed Brian out to the car. It was silence in the long car ride. She just thought of Amber waiting patiently for her to return. Brian had completely no idea how to spark a conversation with the young girl let alone what they would even talk about. Somehow her life felt like a mirror of his. Brian tried to think of something he would like to hear at her age but nothing came to mind. When the car finally stopped in the parking lot of the prison Brian spoke. 

‚ÄúKim just know we all love having you around, and you can stay‚Ä¶‚Äù He stopped talking finding himself leading into a mess of words. Brian rested his head on the steering wheel feeling like a failure until she spoke. 

‚ÄòThank you Mr. Fader.‚Äù Kim just sat with her thoughts for another moment before leaving the car. Brian led her into the facility so they could sign in. The thick walls surrounding them were reminiscent of the freedom they had in the outside world. As they entered the visitor's hall one face stood out amongst the other inmates. Mark pulled up a somber smile as Kim sat across from him at the round table.

‚ÄúI'm sorry you have to see me like this.‚Äù Brian stood near the entrance of the room minding his own business as Mark went on. ‚ÄúI never imagined I'd be trying to raise you from a place like this.‚Äù Mark stood in his chair as he reached for her. He looked like he was any second away from crying. Crow's feet layered his face with bags and dilated pupils. Kim just sat trying not to look directly at him as she rested her hands on the table. Mark grabbed hold of her right hand turning it over in his. Her bruised knuckles and callused palm was easy to spot and even easier to feel. ‚ÄúYour still running yourself ragged in that gym aren't you?‚Äù

Kim pulled away as she hid her hands in the pocket of her hoodie. She left her head looking down. Her eyes stayed fixed on him however.

‚ÄúYou look tired.‚Äù Her quiet voice was a contrast to his raspy one. Mark began explaining the sleepless nights that come with being imprisoned with criminals. Kim just leaned back listening as went on about the food served and long term health effects it may have. Kim wanted to be anywhere else than here. There was a specific place she desired to be. A place so far away it was laughable. It was in the arms of another. 

‚ÄúI'm not boring you am I? You just have this look, there's something else on your mind  isn't there?‚Äù Kim said nothing and just sank more into her chair. The sound of beautiful violin suddenly entered her head, burning her cheeks red. Kim's arms crossed as her father smiled. ‚ÄúIt's a romance isn't it?‚Äù Kim felt her blood start to boil under her face. Mark just leaned back pulling his leg up on the table. Kim thought about doing this for a long time although it never really seemed the right time. ‚ÄúKimmy listen, you can tell me anything, I doubt there is anything you could say that would upset me.‚Äù Her lips quivered as her cheeks shot up.

‚ÄúI'm gay.‚Äù Her voice was so low she could barely hear herself speak. Mark just planted his chair as he reached into his pocket. Mark pulled out a dollar. ‚ÄúHey did you hear me?‚Äù Kim did not want to repeat herself but she was unsure if he was ignoring her.

‚ÄúGo buy yourself a snack at the machine.‚Äù Marked floated the bill in the air waiting for her to take it. Kim stood up snapping back at him.

‚ÄúAre you listening? I'm gay, and where the hell did you even get a dollar?‚Äù Mark just laughed. He stood pushing his chair back as he rubbed the back of his neck.

‚ÄúOf course I am, you act like it's a big deal, I have my ways to get money in here so don't you worry about me sweetheart.‚Äù Kim just stood frozen. ‚ÄúYou're gay so what, if anything it's a relief.‚Äù

‚ÄúA relief? What exactly are you saying?‚Äù Kim slammed her hands down trying to get answers. The room went quiet as a guard glared at Mark.

‚ÄúCalm down Kimmy, I just mean it's nice to know I don't have to worry about some boy knocking you up on the outside.‚Äù Kim's face went from relaxed to disgust as she covered her face. ‚ÄúIt's Brian's daughter isn't it?‚Äù Kim's face burned like the brightest star in the universe as her eyes popped wide. Mark flattened the dollar on the table before sliding it over to her. ‚ÄúI know that face, I was right, well you mind yourself in their household we don't need you causing problems.‚Äù Kim just whipped up the dollar, turning away as she walked to the vending machine. As Kim scanned her candy options Brian moved to the table.

‚ÄúSo how's life?‚Äù Brian quickly realized how his question sounded as he tried to put on a smile. ‚ÄúSorry I didn't mean it to sound like that.‚Äù Mark's eyes shifted between Brian and his daughter. 

‚ÄúIt's as bad as they say, and yet not that crazy, although it's actually pretty hard to get a hold of cigarettes right now.‚Äù Brian just leaned back in his chair as he pulled out a pack of smokes. The warning on the label didn't stop Mark from popping open the pack and jamming a cig in his mouth. Brian lit it up for him leaning over the table. ‚ÄúHow's she doing, you know school and such.‚Äù 

‚ÄúFine, grades are steady and her coach sees potential in her.‚Äù Brian dodged the smoke leaving Mark's mouth as he continued. ‚ÄúHer first rookie is coming up, I'll tape it for you.‚Äù Mark just side eyed Brian as he puffed in his tobacco. One of the guards walked up, setting an ashtray on the table. 

‚ÄúIt's my fault she's so aggressive and angry isn't it?‚Äù As Brian thought of how to respond Mark tapped his cigarette into the ashtray. Mark watched Kim as she stood chewing on chocolate with eyes glued to her phone. 

‚ÄúI can't speak on that, but I know you didn't help.‚Äù Brian leaned back trying to remain calm and keep his words relaxed. Mark just took the longest drag he could before putting out the cigarette. 

‚ÄúBrian I think I should tell you something.‚Äù Mark couldn't help but notice the faint smile on Kim from halfway across the room. Brian sat flipping his metal lighter waiting for Mark to continue. ‚ÄúActually nevermind, I just realized I have nothing to say.‚Äù Mark just laughed. Brian stood as Kim returned. Mark just grabbed Kim tight as he whispered in her ear. ‚ÄúDoes she treat you right?‚Äù Kim just nodded as she pulled back. Mark smiled as he looked back at the guard. The guard opened the door as Mark started walking backwards. ‚ÄúI love you sweetheart, Brian take care of her for me, I'm sorry I can't do it myself, I think about you every night sweetheart!‚Äù Mark was pushed out of the room as Kim just stood letting tears leave her face. Kim just rubbed her eyes before Brian decided it was time to leave. 

The car ride back was just like the car ride their, quiet. Brian didn‚Äôt know how to connect to her, or if he should even try. Acording to Mark, Brian was his last choice to house Kim, but their only other option was a foster home. It didn‚Äôt matter who it was Brian couldn't let a child be let astray. 

‚ÄúSo how is the training going?‚Äù Brian kept his eyes on the road as he attempted small talk. Kim just sighed as she pulled her face away from the window. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to talk if you don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok, everything is going fine, coach says I'm making strides quickly.‚Äù Brian let a simple smile find it‚Äôs way to his face as Kim opened up a bit about her boxing. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty tiering with all the road work I've been doing.‚Äù When they finally got home Kim went right inside. The house seemed empty. Kim just circled the coffee table as her eyes scanned the TV.

‚ÄúUmm.‚Äù Kim turned as Amber‚Äôs voice shot out from the stairs, revealing her bright face. ‚ÄúDo you want to watch some TV?‚Äù Kim took another look around making sure they were alone before nodding. As Amber rushed down the stairs Kim threw up her palm. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôd appreciate it if you kept your hands to yourself.‚Äù Amber just tried to keep her composer following Kim‚Äôs rules as she planted herself on the couch. Kim flipped through channels until she stopped on a movie. They caught the middle of a cartel drug bust sadly with the bad words bleeped out. Amber‚Äôs body gently shook with anticipation. Amber was anticipating anything really. The movie was an after thought for her. All she could think about was the girl sitting next to her. Kim‚Äôs face was glued to the screen. It all just felt like a giant tease and Amber couldn't feel relaxed until suddenly everything became calm as Kim‚Äôa arm wrapped around Amber‚Äôs. Their hands became intertwined as Kim rested her shoulder on Amber‚Äôs. Kim‚Äôs thumb gently rubbed the back of Amber‚Äôs hand as a shootout took place on screen. Time seemed to slow down as Kim‚Äôs eyes became sleepy. Kim slomped in her spot resting her head on Amber. Amber shifted as she fell back on the couch pulled Kim over her body. Amber treated Kim like a sleeping cat not wanting to disturb her slumber. As Amber rubbed Kim's back she slowly shifted awake. Kim pulled her mind together figuring where she was. 

‚ÄúHow is your dad doing?‚Äù Amber‚Äôs words soured Kim‚Äôs face. Kim pulled up her face eying Amber with puckered lips. Amber just kissed her forehead trying to dispell her discomfort. Kim pulled her hand free, poking Amber‚Äôs cheek. Amber kept her cool as Kim pulled herself up a bit. 

‚ÄúHe seems fine for his situation, he seemed sad a bit, but in the end happy to see me.‚Äù Kim just laid her head back down staring blankly at the TV. Amber ran her hand through Kim‚Äôs hair thinking about how happy it made her to see Kim. As the girls relaxed on the couch a young butt planted down on top of them. 

‚ÄúWhat we watching ladies?‚Äù Sam took her fleshy throne as she swiped up the remote. The girls tried to wrestle free under Sam. They both screamed for her to remove her fanny from on top of them. The girls found an extra burst of strength as the sound of feet hit the stairs. Kim and Amber shuffled to opposite sides of Sam as Doge made her way into the room. Sam held back a laugh as best she could watching her mother pass by to the kitchen. Both Amber and Kim gave her a big slug to the shoulders for her childish antics. The girls could hear the rustling of pots and pans as lunch entered everyone's minds. 

Doge had the idea of cooking up a big pot of rice while steaming up vegetables and grilling some chicken. Food didn‚Äôt last long in this house especially when everyone was home. After everyone‚Äôs tummies were satisfied they went their separate ways. Kim just rushed up to her room leaving Amber alone at the dinner table. 

Paranoia set in. She wasn't sure how to handle her feelings. She wanted to race upstairs after her but felt it was coming on too strong. Amber‚Äôs fingers taped the table as she peered off into space. Suddenly a figure entered that space as Kim tossed her gloves onto the table. 

‚ÄúGo a round with me?‚Äù Amber smiled as she agreed to sparing. Amber pulled on the boxing gloves as she followed Kim outside. The sun took its place angled in the sky as the girls touched gloves. Amber floated on the grass as she watched Kim sway back and forth. It was like an angel was fixated on knocking Amber out. Kim kept her face calm as she threw her jabs. Amber just dodged as she kept her gloves up blocking the hits. Amber just held off on her throws. Kim‚Äôs arms relaxed as she frustratingly knocked Amber in the mouth. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing? Hit me!‚Äù Amber stumbled back as she tried to balance herself. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can, I wouldn‚Äôt want to damage your pretty face.‚Äù Amber hid her face behind her mits explaining her reasoning behind not striking back. Kim‚Äôs eyes bulged as she felt goosebumps form on her arms. Kim turned punching the tree as hard as she could. 

‚ÄúAhh you're so ridiculous, you want to play? You strike me good in the face and you can kiss it!‚Äù Amber‚Äôs eyes went wide as Kim slammed her gloves together. Kim took her stance as Amber‚Äôs path was clear. Amber raised her hands watching her partner's motions. Kim tossed a left and then a right following up with another left. Amber blocked each jab as she moved forward. Amber tossed her right gently nicking Kim‚Äôs face. Amber pulled Kim into a clinch as she kissed her cheek. Kim pushed her away as she tried to gather her strength. Another furry of jabs came forth followed by a counter punch, a clinch, and a kiss. Kim‚Äôs anger took over as she cut through the air. She closed the gap Amber kept making, throwing the biggest hard punch she could muster. Amber‚Äôs stars were rocked as Kim‚Äôs fist launched right between her hands slamming into her face. Kim‚Äôs reaction time was immediate as she stepped forward. Kim grabbed Amber‚Äôs arm stopping her from falling back as she clinched her tight. ‚ÄúI'm sorry! I didn‚Äôt mean to hit you so hard!‚Äù Amber just started laughing in Kim‚Äôs arms. 

‚ÄúYou hit me in the lips, that means you gotta kiss em.‚Äù Kim pulled back as her gloves slammed into the sides of Amber‚Äôs head. Amber‚Äôs body tensed with emotion as Kim held her head tight holding it in place before smashing their lips together. Amber‚Äôs eyes rolled until they closed, locking her into this moment. A loud smooch echoed through the emptiness as Kim pulled back. Amber just dropped to her knees dazed. Kim rushed to get her gloves off. The stars in Amber's eyes faded as Kim grabbed her by the shoulders pulling her up on her feet. Amber felt her body shrink with worry. ‚ÄúI'm sorry I didn't mean to mess up our sparring,‚Äù Amber blurted out, trying to apologize as Kim slammed her against the tree. Their eyes locked as words were spoken in silence. Kim's eyes were saying shut up while Amber's eyes were saying what's going on. Kim just threw her hands on the tree behind Amber as she kissed her.

‚ÄúNo one can see us right?‚Äù Kim asked, pulling her eyes around the yard. Amber just shook her head rapidly before Kim grabbed her forehead holding her face still. 

To no one's surprise someone could see them. The rearview mirror of the van happened to be in perfect view of the tree. Amber's mother laid quietly in her bed watching the mirror as her heart jumped with warmth watching young romance blossom before her. ",1,1747196971.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Even though he said it in a pretty neutral tone, it totally hit me like a ton of bricks. I couldn't stop thinking about how he might be seeing me as slacking or something, and it kinda stressed me out for the rest of the day. Then, later that evening, my best friend said practically the same thing when we were having coffee, but she was laughing about it and called me ""Miss Dreamy"" or something silly. That had me cracking up, and I wasn't worried at all.

It's interesting how the exact same words can have such a different impact on us, based on who says them and the way they're said. I'm pretty sure this is because of what psychologists call 'perceived social role'. When someone like a boss, who's in a position of authority, makes a comment, we tend to weigh their words more heavily because there's a lot more at stake‚Äîlike, job security, respect, etc. On the other hand, when a friend says it, we don't see any threat, so it's more like sharing a moment than being scrutinized. Just shows how context and relationship totally shape our perception!",2,1747196632.0,WhyWeAct,0,1.0,False
1km6fvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiaryOfARedditor/comments/1km6fvu/real_05132025/,[Real] (05/13/2025),"Today, I recovered from yesterday‚Äôs hard work. I spent the day in bed, resting, taking care, and online ‚Äúwork‚Äù. One YouTube video by a man named Dewayne titled ‚Äúgreen peas and liver‚Äù reminded me that it is important to be on time. Well, about this, I‚Äôve had an email letting me know that there are work documents that have a deadline, but I can only take care of those at the restaurant‚Äôs desktop computer. So, today, being reminded that it was the last day to take care of that, I got up, showered and packed some cookies and coffee from yesterday, for breakfast and headed out. I let my manager know, I was on my way. He told me that, we would take care of it tomorrow. I just couldn‚Äôt get past the urgent message stating that the 13th was the last day to do it. I thought I‚Äôd bring it up again,  but he was very busy, and doing so made him frustrated. Still, he reminded me that tomorrow we would do it. I figured since he‚Äôs in charge of me, I could disregard the urgency of the email. So I sat down in the restaurant to eat some cookies. A few of the companies higher ups were sitting on one side of the restaurant and were discussing things in a meeting. I waved to some of them. They waved back. It makes me glad to know that management concerns themselves with the well being of our restaurant. I finished my cookies, and went home. I waved to those who were watchful on my way out. Once I got home, I was reminded by my daily workout app ‚ÄúElevate‚Äù, not to forget my workout.  This coincided with my schedule, but the timely reminder was appreciated. 

So, I‚Äôm here in my living room, working out. Praying, because there is much important things happening in my life. 

Just now, I got a phone call. Someone who left their clothes here was asking for them back. I already had washed and folded and bagged all her things together. It was cold, but I brought out her clothes when she pulled up across the street. I could only hope she does the same with my things, although in the past, she has made many promises to return my borrowed goods, but has only brought back a select few. So I guess, sadly, I don‚Äôt expect truly to get those things back. But thats the very nature of why the boundaries of distance are necessary. Once the other party showed no concern for my well being, and even an ambition to cause me harm. I no longer could take that person claim of love and her words seriously. And slowly, the relationship deteriorated. She excused herself from any wrongdoing and as long I do the right thing, as best I can, I leave the rest. It‚Äôs not up to me.

I will finish my workout and probably eat.

I hope y‚Äôall have a good night.",2,1747196630.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False

He was kind, thoughtful with his words, super respectful and so cute! I thought the date went pretty well. We didn‚Äôt laugh a ton, but the conversation flowed, and we were both really engaged. It actually lasted three hours, and we even moved from coffee to dinner.

He told me he‚Äôs usually pretty shy and reserved, but I didn‚Äôt really get the feeling he was into me. On past dates, guys usually asked to see me again right then and there, or they‚Äôd throw in little compliments that made it clear they were attracted to me. He didn‚Äôt do any of that, so I was kind of surprised when he texted me right after we parted ways.

Here‚Äôs how it went:

Him: Looks like I‚Äôm winning again! (We had an inside joke about who was in higher demand, since he seemed to be pretty popular with women.)

Me: Oh, but since you‚Äôre such a gentleman, you‚Äôll let me win this one.

Him: Fair enough. Let me know when you get home.

Me: Home! Thanks again for everything. See? You got home safe and sound I‚Äôm a harmless date.

Him: Oh thank you so much for looking after my well being! 

Me: I‚Äôd hate for some girl to take advantage of such a kind soul like yours.

(He liked my last message.)

And‚Ä¶ that was six days ago. I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. Should I text him, or just let it go and move on with my pride intact?

1km6erv,https://www.reddit.com/r/APPsychology/comments/1km6erv/pls_grade_my_aaq/,pls grade my aaq,"1. The research method used in this study is an experiment.
2. Interruption is operationally defined as the 30 second phone call about coffee half the mothers received on their first word and the 30 second phone call about coffee the second half of the mothers received on their second word.
3. The difference in means indicates that children who learned a word while their mother was interrupted had a lower average attention span towards the word being acted out than children who learned a word while their mother was not interrupted. This suggests that interruptions in learning can affect how a child learns vocabulary words.
4. An ethical guideline applied is the use of informed consent of all the mothers.
5. The research findings may be generalizable to a broader population of males and females, as an equal number of both were used in the study. Also, due to the mother child pairs all being from suburban communities around the same East Coast City, we can generalize the results to a larger population of mothers in the surrounding communities of this suburban area.
6. The mean attention given for a word that was learned without interruptions was significantly higher at 0.63 seconds, compared to the mean attention given for a word that was learned with interruptions, at 0.5 seconds. This indicates that divided attention may play a negative role in the grasping of vocabulary of young children.

My general prescription is 60 mg's per day IR. (2 30's a day spaced out)

I haven't been on Adderall since late 2022 when the shortage  really started to hit hard. I decided to stop. It was a struggle but long story short, I did. 

I decided recently that I wanted to get back it after trying some old pre 2022 30 mg vyvanse. They worked well for a low dose. 

so I went back to my doctor and he gave me my usual 60 mg a day dose. I'm grateful he gave me the full dose because I was planning on just taking maybe 30mg max a day and stockpiling for shortage issues. He agreed that I should do that also. 

I went to my usual pharmacy and was given Epic pharma pills. I knew 15mg was going to be great and would feel that jolt and be ready for the day.
Well.. I did get the jolt (kind of) and yes I was stimulated for a short time.. but I just wasn't.. well nearly as FOCUSED on the task at hand as I recall being in the past. I was so disappointed. But figured my body just needed to get regulated. 

But now I'm 3 weeks into it. And I can take a 30 mg slam coffee and vape and be ready to fall asleep and eat everything in sight within an hour. I do feel like it kinda works sometimes. 

And it's not doing nearly what it used to do in terms of helping me get on track and excel in life.  I know that having a well rounded diet, exercise routine and regular therapy is important which I am also doing! 

It's nothing like how I remember it. No matter how many times I went on it or off it.. 
it always worked.. no matter what. 

What's going on!
