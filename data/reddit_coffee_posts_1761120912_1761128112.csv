( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1od45lt,https://i.redd.it/p9kgwt91ymwf1.jpeg,r/SuperLeague interview with Hull KR & England half-back Mikey Lewis!,"**Firstly congrats on the Grand Final and on the Rob Burrow man of the match award from** r/SuperLeague

>Thank you!

**Can you just summarise your thoughts on your season so far.** 

>Yeah it‚Äôs been fantastic. We started really well and just gradually got better, had a little bit of a dip in the middle of the year but managed to win our first trophy in 43 years at this famous stadium (Wembley) and then went on to win the League Leaders which was another fantastic achievement. We just wanted to chase that feeling again, we went through a blip where we weren‚Äôt at the races and other teams were catching us up. But we had the connection and belief within ourselves that we‚Äôd get back to the top and get through it which we did, the last two games we were fantastic. We stuck to our process and went to Old Trafford as underdogs I think, Wigan were the in-form team and we just trusted our process, ability and the belief within the squad and executed our plan really well and got the win.

**You had an incredible season obviously. You‚Äôve faced off against Wigan, Warrington etc. in big games all year, and when you come to somewhere like this and play for England how do you switch out of that rivalry? Obviously you might end up paired with George Williams, you ran out on this pitch (Wembley) to try beat each other six months ago. Does it come naturally or is it just the love for the shirt/country?**  


>I think it‚Äôs a bit of both, it‚Äôs the culture that Shaun and the other England staff have built. The culture here is like it‚Äôs a club, and we have that here. Everyone gets on really well and we have a close knit group to be honest. It has been ever since I‚Äôve been in the England camps and it‚Äôs been pretty tight knit, everyone gets on like we‚Äôre club mates - that‚Äôs how it feels both on the field and when we are off it spending time with each other. It‚Äôs really good, me and George are pretty close anyway so there is no problem there!

**With the World Cup next year, some people have asked the question how serious the teams are taking the series. Does anyone view this as a warmup for the World Cup, and how much would it mean to you to win on a personal level?**

>We go out to every game to win, and this is not a warm-up game for anything. It‚Äôs a historic series within the sport, it‚Äôs The Ashes! We want to go out there and win and we will do anything possible to make sure that we win the test series and come home with that trophy. Obviously that would put us in really good stead for the World Cup, and would be a massive confidence boost and we can‚Äôt wait for that, but we want to win this series.

**You‚Äôve already had a very successful career and season so far, but where would winning The Ashes rank in that?**

>It would be up there, it would definitely be top three. To beat the best over there and get a win over them would be fantastic. It would be a highlight of my career, it would be talked about for years and you‚Äôd get put into that category of the last England/Great Britain team to win which would be brilliant.

**After the Grand Final you talked about legacy, is building that something that‚Äôs really important to you personally?**

>Yeah 100%, when I eventually retire (which is obviously a long time in the future) I want to have that legacy and be in the group of players who are talked about for years to come.

**How much of the NRL do you watch?**

>Yeah I watch it when I can.

**From watching, is there anyone in their setup that you particular admire and can‚Äôt wait to line up against?**

>Yeah probably a couple. The two half backs are massive people in the game over in Australia and I‚Äôve watched them closely, reviewing what they do both on and off the ball, and try to take little things from their game into mine.



**Finally, does it feel good to be able to walk around London and not be recognised/stopped by everyone in the street like you are in Hull?**

>We‚Äôre actually staying a bit out of London, it‚Äôs great to just relax with the boys have a coffee and get to know each other on a deeper level before we take to the pitch on Saturday.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

""Ma'am, you've tried on a ton of pieces already. Nothing catching your eye?""

""Ma'am?""

Freya Harper blinked, shaking herself back to the present.

She hesitated, then pointed at a diamond necklace, her voice flat. ""That one. Wrap it up.""

The clerk let out a relieved breath, like she'd just dodged a disaster. ""You got it, one sec.""

The jewelry store was buzzing, every clerk grinning like they'd hit the jackpot.

And why not? Freya had been dropping by every day for three months straight.

One clerk, barely hiding her jealousy, spoke up, ""Mrs. Grant, your husband's gotta be crazy about you, huh? Buying jewelry like it's candy. I'm so jealous!""

Another jumped in, ""For real. They say love follows the cash, and your guy's throwing around big bucks. He's totally smitten.""

""Loaded and a total softie? Mrs. Grant, you're living the dream!""

Freya forced a tight smile, barely there.

Her eyes, though, were fixed on a clerk across the counter.

Unlike the others fawning over her, this one was quietly boxing up the necklace Freya had just picked out.

The woman's hands were soft, delicate, almost too perfect‚Äîpale and slender, the kind that made one stop and stare.

Freya felt like a creep, gawking like that.

But she couldn't help it. She needed a closer look at the woman who'd managed to steal her cool-headed husband's heart.

The woman who'd made him toss aside fifteen years of their love, break every promise they'd made when they were head over heels, and fall for her. A plain-looking clerk named Natalie.

Natalie wasn't a stunner. She was cute enough, sure, but nothing to write home about. Except for those hands.

They were something else‚Äîgraceful, almost fragile, the kind that could make anyone, guy or girl, do a double-take.

As Freya turned to go, she paused. ""Hey, can you guys do me a favor?""

She was their VIP, so of course they could.

She slipped the ring off her left hand and handed it over. ""Melt this down for me.""

The clerk's eyes went wide. ""Whoa, isn't that your wedding ring? And‚Ä¶ it's got something engraved.""

It did. L&F

Their initials. Liam and Freya. A promise of love, carved by Liam himself.

The clerk checked again, her voice shaky. ""Mrs. Grant, this ring's special, right? You sure you want it melted?""

""Dead sure,"" Freya said, her tone cold as steel. ""Make it quick.""

*****

When Freya got home, the sky was fading into dusk. She barely stepped through the door when Liam came rushing toward her.

They crashed into each other. Freya stumbled back, nearly losing her footing, until a strong hand grabbed her waist, steadying her.

Liam's brow was furrowed, sweat beading on his forehead. ""Where were you? It's late‚Äîwhy didn't you call?""

""Yeah, Mrs. Grant,"" piped up Rose Frost, their housekeeper, from behind him. ""It's past seven. You gotta give Mr. Grant a heads-up if you're gonna be out late. He was about to call the cops!""

Liam's assistant, Jason Mayer, was there too, looking like he'd just exhaled for the first time in hours.

He muttered into his phone, ""Sorry, Officer, she's back. Thanks for your help.""

Liam leaned in, eyeing her like she might've been in a car wreck.

He reached out, brushing her cheek, then frowned. ""You're ice-cold.""

Freya pushed his hand away and stepped past him into the house. ""I was bored, went for a walk. Phone died.""

Liam caught up in a few quick steps, shrugging off his suit jacket and tossing it over her shoulders.

He pulled her close as they walked. ""It's chilly out there. Don't catch a cold.""

She squirmed a little, but his grip was firm, so she let it slide.

Once inside, Liam called out to Rose, ""Make her some honey water, warm her up.""

Then to Jason, ""Swing by Lucky Restaurant's for takeout. You know Mrs. Grant's favorite dishes‚Äîtell them to go light on the salt and sugar.""

""On it, Mr. Grant,"" Jason said, heading out.

The living room cleared out, leaving just Freya and Liam.

He kept his arm around her shoulders, his hold strong but his voice gentle. ""I got a little worked up earlier, came on too strong. You're not mad, right?""

Freya shook her head. ""Nah, I'm cool.""

""You've been off lately, like something's eating at you. Did I screw up somehow?""

""I'm good.""

""No, you're not,"" Liam said, his voice firm. ""Freya, we've been together fifteen years. I know when you're upset. I've been wracking my brain, but I'm coming up empty. Just tell me what I did, and I'll fix it. Please.""

Freya looked up at him, this man she'd loved for fifteen years, and suddenly he felt like a stranger.

His face was the same‚Äîsharper now, grown from a cocky, good-looking kid to a polished, successful man. But something was off. She didn't know him anymore.

""It's just my period,"" she said.

Liam wasn't convinced. ""That's it? Really?""

She nodded. ""Yeah.""

He pulled out his phone. ""I'm taking the week off. If anything comes up, Jason can bring the files.""

Freya frowned. ""What's that about?""

""Staying home with you,"" he said. ""You're not yourself. I'll hang out, keep you company.""

She let out a soft chuckle.

""What's so funny?"" he asked.

""With a husband this sweet, how could I not laugh?""

Liam grinned, his face lighting up. ""Freya, if something's bugging you, you gotta spill. We're in this together. No secrets.""

""And you?"" she asked, her voice quiet. ""Got anything you're keeping from me?""

He leaned in, dropping a playful kiss on her lips. ""We've been married three years. How 'bout we start thinking about a kid?""

Freya didn't answer. Instead, she pulled a stack of papers from her bag. ""Take a look at this. Then sign it.""

Liam didn't even glance at the pages.

He flipped to the last one, scribbled his name, and handed it back. ""Done.""

""You didn't even read it,"" she said.

""Whatever you want, I'm good with,"" he said. ""Freya, I know you're nervous about the whole kid thing. If signing this makes you feel safer, I'm all for it.""

""Liam, you should really read it first.""

His phone buzzed. A text.

He glanced at it, and a soft smile curved his lips, his eyes so warm they could melt ice.

His fingers tapped out a quick reply.

A moment later, he stood. ""Freya, I'm stepping out to make a call.""

""Sure,"" she said.

Once he was gone, Freya got up and headed to the garage.

She started the car, and the dashboard screen lit up, still synced to Liam's text messages.

His chat history was right there, plain as day.

Naty: [That rich lady came in again, snapping up more bling! Score! My paycheck's gonna be fat this month. Dinner's on me!]

Liam: [That excited, huh?]

Naty: [Hell yeah! Here's hoping she keeps coming back. I'm obsessed with this VIP!]

Liam: [I used to buy stuff every day too, and you didn't hype me up like this.]

Naty: [Oh, come on, she's my cash cow! My VVVIP!]

Liam: [And what am I?]

Naty: [You're old news, buddy. Nobody's slowing down my hustle!]

Liam: [Use me and ditch me, huh?]

Naty: [LOL, let's talk on the phone. That lady tried on like fifty necklaces today. I'm wiped, and my fingers are toast.]

Liam: [Alright.]

Freya stared at the name ""Naty"" on the screen, her chest tight. She closed her eyes.

Natalie. Those perfect hands. The images flooded her mind, relentless.

She killed the engine and went back inside.

On the couch, the papers Liam had signed sat untouched.

She picked them up, slipped them back into her bag.

At the top, in bold black letters, five words stood out: [Divorce Agreement.]

Chapter 2 Countdown To Goodbye
Tucked beside the divorce papers was another file.

Freya had hired a private eye to dig into Natalie's life.

Twenty-three, barely scraped through high school, trained as a nurse, from some backwater town. Her parents were hustling odd jobs in Haventon, while her deadbeat brother gambled away whatever they had.

When Freya first caught on to Liam's fling with Natalie, she racked her brain trying to make sense of it.

A girl with plain looks, an okay figure, no real education, and a family straight out of a soap opera‚Äîwhat was it about her that had Liam so hooked?

'What, is it just those pretty hands of hers?' Freya wondered. 'Or after fifteen years together, is he just bored with me?'

When Liam sauntered back in, Freya was planted in her chair, acting like she hadn't just been snooping in the garage, uncovering his dirty little secret.

He flashed a lazy smile, his eyes still warm, as he slipped his phone into the inner pocket of his suit jacket. ""Hey, babe, gotta step out for a sec,"" he said, sounding almost apologetic.

Rose came out with a steaming mug of ginger tea. ""Mr. Grant, you're heading out this late? Work stuff, I'm guessing?""

Liam gave a quiet ""Yup,"" barely audible. ""Someone real important's treating me to dinner.""

*****

Liam's tires screeched as he tore out of the driveway.

Rose turned to Freya. ""Ma'am, have some of honey water to warm you up. Mr. Grant asked me to whip it up just for you.""

Freya took the mug. ""It's too hot right now. I'll drink it when it cools. It's late‚Äîyou should hit the sack.""

""You sure you'll have it?""

""Yeah, I got it.""

Rose untied her apron and left the villa.

Freya poured the tea down the toilet, flushed it, then grabbed her sunglasses and a mask. She slipped out the door.

Flagging a cab, she leaned in. ""Tail that car up ahead.""

Half an hour later, Liam's black Range Rover rolled to a stop outside a beat-up old apartment building.

A few minutes later, a slim figure darted out, hopping into the passenger seat like she owned it.

Those delicate hands slid onto his broad shoulders, and she leaned up, planting a kiss on his lips.

Even though Freya had braced herself, seeing them lock lips in the car hit her like a freight train. She sat there, stunned.

""Ma'am, they're moving. Keep following?"" the driver asked.

Freya blinked, snapping out of it. ""Yeah, stay on 'em.""

Ten minutes later, Liam and Natalie strolled into a bar.

From the moment they stepped out of the car, Natalie was glued to his arm, chattering away like a chirpy little bird.

A few guys were waiting outside a private room.

When they saw Liam and Natalie, they grinned. ""Hi, Liam! Hey, Ms. Stone!""

Natalie eyed the bar's swanky decor, pouting playfully. ""I thought I was buying you dinner! I can't afford a place like this!""

Liam chuckled, his voice all warm and gooey. ""What, you wanna hit up a food truck at the night market?""

Natalie puffed out her lip, cute as a button. ""Food trucks are the best! I'd treat you to every taco stand from one end of the strip to the other.""

""Yeah, and I'd be camped out in the bathroom from midnight to noon.""

Natalie stuck out her tongue. ""How was I supposed to know your stomach's so high-maintenance? I eat street food all the time and I'm totally fine.""

One of the guys busted out laughing. ""Ms. Stone, you're so down-to-earth. Liam, you're one lucky guy.""

Yup, to everyone, Natalie was all about keeping it real. Unlike Freya, who was apparently just a shopaholic blowing cash on jewelry.

*****

Freya dragged herself home well after midnight.

She booked a courier on her phone, took a quick shower, and crashed, dead to the world.

In the morning, Liam was standing with his back to her, buttoning up a dress shirt.

Freya squinted, confused. ""You‚Ä¶ slept here last night?""

Liam let out a soft laugh. ""What's that supposed to mean? When have I ever not come home?""

""But weren't you‚Äî""

'Off cozying up with your side chick?' she added silently.

Liam moved quick, pinning her to the bed. ""Or what‚Äîwere you up all night waiting for me to come back‚Ä¶ so we could get started on a kid?""

His last words came with a hot breath against her lips.

His kiss landed hard, deep, no quick peck.

Freya pushed back with both arms. ""Get off me.""

Liam's eyes were still smoldering as he propped himself up. ""What's wrong?""

Freya started, ""I‚Äî""

Ring ring! Her phone blared.

She snatched it up fast. ""Yeah, it's me. You're here? Alright, I'm coming down.""

She shoved him off and slid out of bed.

Liam's mood soured, clearly ticked at the interruption. ""Who's calling you at the crack of dawn? And a guy?""

Freya's face tightened as she yanked on a jacket and snapped, ""It's late. Don't you have a job to get to?""

""You forgot? I told Jason to clear my schedule. I'm sticking around to spend time with you.""

""I'm fine. I don't need you hovering.""

Liam stood, wrapping his arms around her waist from behind, dropping soft kisses along her neck. ""Without me, how're we gonna make that baby?""

His grip tightened, heavy with intent.

Freya's temper flared, and she pushed him harder. ""Let go.""

Liam brushed it off like it was flirty teasing, grabbing her chin for another kiss, mumbling, ""Ain't letting go.""

""Get off!""

Freya didn't know where the strength came from, but she broke free of his hold.

Liam froze, arms still raised like he was holding her, his eyes brewing with irritation and confusion. ""Freya, what's your deal?""

She turned away, smoothing out her messed-up clothes. ""Nothing. I've got a delivery guy waiting downstairs. Don't wanna keep him waiting.""

When Freya hit the living room, the courier was already there, let in by Rose.

He stood up, a bit uneasy. ""Mrs. Grant? You've got something to ship?""

Freya nodded. ""Come with me.""

She led him upstairs to the bedroom.

Liam was leaning against the wall, arms crossed, glaring at the courier. ""Who let you in here? Get out.""

The guy stammered, ""Uh, Mrs. Grant‚Äî""

""It's fine,"" Freya cut in, swinging open the closet. She turned to the courier. ""Those boxes right there. Can you weigh 'em?""

Liam's eyes darted to the closet‚Äîonce crammed full, now practically empty. His brow furrowed. ""Freya, where's all your stuff?""

She pointed at the boxes.

""You're packing your clothes? You're bailing?""Liam straightened up, grabbing her shoulder. ""Freya, where the hell are you going?""

Chapter 3 Doesn't Need A Man To Keep Breathing
Freya tilted her chin up, locking eyes with the man she'd loved for fifteen years, a sly smirk tugging at her lips.

She was outta here‚Äîeventually. Just not today.

The divorce papers? Already locked down, thanks to some slick moves on her part. But there was still a thirty-day period before the divorce would be official.

Liam's game was clear as day now: playing the perfect husband at home, all mushy talk about babies and forever, while sneaking off for a ""new flavor"" on the side.

He thought he could keep it on the low, juggling both lives like some smooth-talking player.

Big mistake. He forgot about a woman's gut.

Sure, he'd been sneaky‚Äîreal sneaky. But fifteen years together don't lie. One dodgy glance, one off vibe, and Freya's instincts lit up. From there, it was a quick hop to sniffing out the other woman: Natalie.

Freya didn't hold it against anyone. People get bored, chase something shiny‚Äîit's just how it goes.

Liam might be fine playing both sides, but Freya? She wasn't about to be one of his boats, stuck bobbing in his little harbor.

There were rivers, lakes, and whole damn oceans out there, and she was ready to sail.

Freya wasn't the kind of woman who'd crumble without a guy propping her up.

""Hey, talk! Why's all your stuff packed?"" Liam's voice had a sharp edge, his grip on her shoulders a tad too tight.

Freya let out a quick wince.

He eased up, but his eyes stayed glued to her, waiting for an answer.

Freya flashed a breezy smile. ""These clothes? So yesterday. I'm done with them. Gonna donate the whole lot and splurge on some new ones.

""What, you said yesterday I could buy whatever I want, no need to check with you. You backing out already?""

Liam blinked, thrown off. ""You're packing‚Ä¶ to give them away?""

Freya nodded. ""Dumping them's a waste. Better they go to someone who'll rock 'em.""

Liam let out a relieved laugh. ""Damn, babe, you had me shook. Thought you were packing to ditch me.""

""Why would I jet? You haven't done anything dirty, right?""

""Exactly! We're good. Why'd you ever walk out on this?""

The delivery guy hovering nearby was eating up the drama like it was a reality show, grinning like he'd won the lottery.

And the job? Four huge boxes, probably weighing a ton. Ka-ching.

He was in such a great mood, he couldn't resist chiming in. ""Man, Mr. Grant, you're totally whipped for Mrs. Grant, huh? Gotta say, lady, you're living the dream. Loyal guys like him? Rarer than a four-leaf clover!""

Liam slung an arm around Freya's waist, all smug and possessive. ""Hear that? A catch like me? You'd need a treasure map to find another. Better hold on tight, babe.""

Freya wiggled free with a playful nudge. ""Where's my wallet? Gotta pay this guy.""

*****

After breakfast, Liam ducked into his study.

Wednesday mornings meant his big-shot executive meeting. He wasn't heading to the office, but he still had to jump on a Zoom call.

Freya made a call of her own. ""Mr. Carter, you looked over those divorce papers yet? Any roadblocks?""

James Carter's voice came through, clear but cautious. ""Papers are solid. No kids, no custody fights, and you're not asking for a penny, so it's clean. But‚Ä¶""

""But what?""

""When it's time to file at the courthouse, Mr. Grant's gotta sign in person. You sure he's cool with splitting?""

Freya's jaw tightened. ""Any way to dodge him and still get this divorce done?""

""That's a tough nut to crack.""

Freya grinned, wiring a fat stack of cash to James's account. ""How about now? Got any bright ideas?""

The guy's tone flipped like a pancake. ""Well, it's tricky, but there's always a workaround.""

""Lay it on me.""

""Get Mr. Grant to sign a power of attorney. His lawyer can step in and handle the divorce with you.""

Freya mulled it over. She'd already sweet-talked him into signing once. Another signature? Piece of cake.

""Got it. Draw up that power of attorney. I'll get him to sign, and you'll come with me to wrap this up,"" she said.

""Whoa, hang on a sec,"" James sputtered. ""That's a hard pass.""

Freya's patience was hanging by a thread. ""Chill, you'll get a nice chunk of change when this is over.""

""It's not the cash,"" he said, sounding antsy. ""Mr. Grant's gonna figure this out eventually. You'll be off living large, but I'm stuck in this town. If he comes after me, my little firm's toast.""

""So what's your fix?""

He paused, then muttered, ""You got any other lawyers you trust? Preferably the kind who'd pull this off and then bounce?""

A sketchy lawyer? Freya didn't have one on speed dial.

But a lawyer who'd kill to see her and Liam split? That one was already in her pocket.

*****

Three in the afternoon, a small coffee shop buzzing with low chatter.

Freya had been nursing her coffee for two hours when he finally sauntered in, late as always.

""Hey, Mr. Reed, been a minute,"" she said, keeping her voice casual.

The guy was a skyscraper‚Äînearly six-foot-three, decked out in a sharp suit that fit like a glove. His lips curled into a smirk, tinged with just a touch of shade.

Ryan Reed, Liam's best bud since forever, the youngest of the Reed clan from the east side.

His two older brothers were at each other's throats over the family fortune, but Ryan? He was above all that. After law school, he'd walked away from the drama and hung out his shingle as a lawyer.

For whatever reason, though, ever since Freya and Liam got together, Ryan had a chip on his shoulder about her. Always throwing side-eye, never warming up.

Unlike Liam's other pals, who'd toss out a playful ""Mrs. Grant"" with a grin, Ryan stuck to a cold ""Ms. Harper,"" like he was chewing on glass.

""Ms. Harper, what's the occasion?"" he drawled, slouching into the chair across from her. ""Not like we've got much to chew over.""

Freya gave him a tight smile. ""Just wanted to give you props, Counselor.""

Ryan arched a brow. ""Props? For what?""

""Your dream's come true. You got your wish.""

She reached into her bag and slid a stack of photos across the table‚Äîsnaps from a private investigator.

Liam and Natalie, cozy as could be. Holding hands, hugging, and yeah, locking lips.

Ryan glanced at the pictures and let out a dry chuckle. ""Well, hot damn. Looks like Liam finally got his head on straight. No sense wasting your life swinging from a crooked branch, right?""

Freya was used to his snarky jabs by now. Crooked branch? Whatever. Right now, he was her ticket to a divorce.

Ryan pushed the photos back, his eyes glinting with that cocky vibe he always had. ""So, what's the play, Ms. Harper? You want me to drag Liam back to the happy homestead? Hate to break it to you, but I'd rather watch you two crash and burn.""

""I figured,"" Freya said, cool as ice. ""That's why we're on the same team this time.""

Ryan's brow shot up again. ""Yeah? How's that?""

""I'm gonna get Liam to sign a power of attorney. You'll rep him as his lawyer, and we're gonna push through this divorce together.""

Chapter 4 A Start And A Finish
Ryan frowned, thrown for a loop. ""Ms. Harper, you guys have been at it for fifteen years. Word is, you're still trying for a kid. What's the play here?""

""Just say if you're in or out, Mr. Reed,"" Freya said.

Ryan didn't bite right away. He studied her, like he was trying to see through her poker face and figure out what she was scheming.

Just then, a waiter with a tray of coffee tripped, bumping into Freya. She stumbled, landing right in Ryan's arms.

Outside the caf√©, tucked in a shadowy corner, a camera shutter clicked, capturing the moment.

Ryan caught the flash, his jaw tightening as he eased Freya back, not too gently. ""Someone's got a tail on you.""

Freya steadied herself against the table, waving it off. ""Nobody's following me.""

""Someone just snapped us,"" Ryan said, his tone sharp but with a playful edge. ""Ms. Harper, you piss off the wrong person? That little hug we just had? If that pic gets out, it's gonna raise some eyebrows.""

Freya let out a soft chuckle. ""Mr. Reed, if you're as squeaky clean as you say, what's there to worry about?""

Ryan smirked, leaning back in his chair. ""Ms. Harper, you always this‚Ä¶ laid-back?""

Freya scooped up her things and slipped on her sunglasses. ""Mr. Reed, I've got places to be. I want this divorce done quick, and I'm betting you do too. Get that power of attorney drafted and email me a copy. I'll make sure Liam signs, and we'll get this ball rolling.""

""Deal.""

Freya turned and walked out. She hopped into a cab.

During the ride, her phone buzzed with a few photos‚Äîher and Ryan, shot from a sneaky angle.

It looked like Ryan was practically holding her in a lover's embrace, the vibe way too intimate.

[Freya, pics good?]

The text came from her friend Chloe White , a pro wedding photographer with a killer eye for juicy shots.

Freya: [Perfect. Thanks, Chloe.]

Chloe: [Still don't get it. You trying to mess with Liam's head?]

Freya: [He's yesterday's news. I'm not that petty.]

Chloe: [Then what's the deal?]

Freya tapped out a reply: [Ryan's a loose cannon. I'm worried he'll throw a wrench in my plans. I need some dirt to keep him in line.]

Chloe wasn't following. [You think he'll sabotage the divorce? Doesn't he want you and Liam split up?]

Freya sighed. [Sure, but he gets a bigger kick out of messing with me.]

It wasn't the first time. Every time she had a plan, Ryan seemed dead set on screwing it up.

Now, with her mind made up about the divorce, she wasn't about to let him derail her. She needed a safety net.

Suddenly, the cab slammed on the brakes. Freya lurched forward, smacking into the front seat's headrest.

The driver let out a curse. ""Damn lovebirds making out in the street, screwing up traffic! What's their deal?""

Freya glanced out the window. Up ahead, a guy and a girl stood together.

He'd just picked something up off the ground and handed it to her.

She was crying, clearly touched, and threw her arms around him.

They hugged right there in the road, forcing cars to screech to a halt.

A guy from a black sedan nearby hopped out, fuming. ""Can you two take your lovefest somewhere else? This is dangerous, you know!""

Liam, one arm around the woman, flashed an OK sign with a charming grin. ""My bad, man. My girlfriend dropped her bracelet. Just grabbed it for her.""

""Dropped or not, you don't run into traffic for it! What if you got hit? You're holding up all these cars! You owe us something!""

Liam stayed cool as a cucumber, raising his voice just enough. ""Sorry, folks. I'll cover any damages. Figure out the cost, hit up my assistant, and I'll pay triple.""

Money talks. The drivers ready to rip into him suddenly backed off at the promise of triple pay.

Jason, Liam's assistant, showed up, jotting down numbers, and traffic started moving again.

""Hey, miss, mind hanging tight for a sec? I'll be quick, just gotta give 'em my info,"" the cab driver said, eyeing the payout.

Freya cut him off. ""This ride's, what, ten bucks? Triple's under fifty. I'll give you three hundred. Just drive.""

""Hell yeah!"" The driver grinned, hitting the gas.

'No wonder they say money makes the world go round.' Freya rubbed her temple, suddenly getting why Natalie fell for it.

A good-looking, smooth-talking guy showing up at her shop every day, never crossing the line, never pushing too hard, just buying a little something from her.

That slow, steady pursuit‚Äîfew women could resist. Especially someone like Natalie, scraping by from a rough background.

""That girl's got it good,"" the driver mused. ""Handsome boyfriend, risking it all for her bracelet. She's set.""

Freya stayed quiet.

The driver kept going. ""But the guy's loaded, right? Why not just buy her a new one? Why risk it for some bracelet?""

'Yeah, why risk it?' she thought.

Freya's mind drifted to how she and Liam met, a moment not so different.

She was in eighth grade, walking home when she found an injured kitten.

She scooped it up, planning to take it to a vet, but somehow, crossing the street, the cat squirmed free, darting into traffic.

Cars swerved, nearly hitting it. Freya panicked, ready to dive in herself, eyes squeezed shut.

Then a figure sprinted across, grabbed the kitten, dodged the cars, and landed beside her.

""Your cat?"" he asked.

He was in a white basketball jersey, headband holding back sweaty hair, beads of sweat dripping down his face.

He pulled her to the sidewalk, handed her the kitten, and said softly, ""A cat's life matters, but yours doesn't? You know how dangerous that was?""

Liam was a senior then, older and towering over her.

Freya, clutching the kitten, felt small in his shadow. She bit her lip and nodded.

His buddies were there. One, rolling his eyes, said, ""That cat's ugly as hell. Love cats? Get a cute one. Risking your life for that? Dumb move.""

Liam shot him a look. ""Shut it.""

""I'm not wrong! It's ugly and filthy.""

""Keep talking, and I'm tossing your nasty sneakers into traffic tomorrow.""

""Hey! Those are my babies! They've got a name‚ÄîWings of the Future!""

Liam crossed his arms, smirking. ""To me, they're ugly and stink. Want new kicks? Buy some. No need to chase 'em down in the street.""

The guy shut up, deflated.

Liam turned back to Freya, his voice softening. ""You're good now. Don't worry.""

""Thanks,"" she replied.

He glanced at her name tag. ""Lincoln School, huh? Freya, right?""

""Yeah.""

He grinned. ""I'm Liam. If you need anything at school, I'm your guy.""

Freya wasn't one to chase people down. Even knowing his name, she never sought him out.

But Liam? He kept showing up, again and again. Over time, everyone could see what he was after.

That day was the start of their story. Today's run-in? Probably the end.

Freya thought to herself, 'It's okay. It started like this, it ends like this. Fifteen years‚Äîlove, laughs, the whole deal. At least it's come full circle.'

Chapter 5 Burning The Past
Freya fished her phone from her pocket and tapped out a number.

He picked up fast. ""Freya? Hey, what's good?""

""Liam, where you at right now?"" Freya asked.

""Office. What's the deal?""

Freya flicked her eyes to the rearview mirror, catching Liam holding hands with Natalie, his other hand pressing the phone to his ear. She nearly laughed out loud.

Natalie looked like she was about to chime in, but Liam threw up a hand to shut her up.

He pointed at the phone, then pressed a finger to his lips, telling her to keep it down.

""Hey, Freya, you craving those pastries from that Eastside joint? I can swing by after work and grab some.""

""Pass,"" she said.

""Didn't you used to be all about their matcha cupcakes?""

""Key word: used to,"" Freya shot back. ""People change, Liam. Stuff I was into back then? Not my vibe anymore.""

His voice got a little tense. ""You sound weird, Freya. Something eating at you?""

""I'm fine,"" she said. ""Go do your thing. I'll leave you to it.""

*****

When Liam rolled in later, he had a box of those cupcakes in hand.

Freya was sorting through old photo albums.

They'd been together forever‚Äîhigh school sweethearts, college, real-world struggles. Road trips, late nights, just living life. The albums from their school days alone took up four or five books.

Liam's face softened when he saw the photos.

He leaned down, wrapping his arms loosely around her from behind. ""What's got you digging through memory lane?""

Freya glanced up. ""Why're you back so early?""

He grinned. ""Missed my girl, that's all. Gotta keep an eye on you.""

Freya stacked the albums neatly and slid them into a cardboard box.

Her fingers brushed a lighter, which she slipped into her jeans pocket on the sly.

She'd planned to burn those albums while he was off with his sidepiece, but him showing up early threw her off.

""Babe, why do I feel like you're not jazzed I'm home early?"" Liam said, half-joking.

Freya stood, dodging his attempt to pull her in by the waist. ""Work's your thing.""

He stuck to her like gum on a shoe. ""Work? Nah, you're the real MVP.""

He leaned in close, his breath warm against her ear. ""Babe, you've been kinda icy lately. Did I screw up? You pissed at me?""

There was a time his closeness felt like a warm hug‚Äîsweet, safe.

Now? It just made her stomach churn.

That hand trying to hold her? It'd been wrapped around another woman. That mouth itching to kiss her? Probably kissed someone else too.

And then there was that faint scent on him‚Äînot his usual cologne, but that department store perfume smell.

Who was hanging out at the mall all day? Yeah, she didn't need a billboard to spell it out.

Freya pushed him away and bolted to the bathroom, puking her guts out.

Liam followed, rubbing her back and handing her a tissue. His worried frown seemed legit. ""Whoa, what's wrong? Bad food? Rose!""

The housekeeper hurried in. ""Yes, sir?""

""What'd she eat for lunch? Something off? You know her stomach's picky‚Äîthat's why you're here. What happened?""

Rose looked clueless. ""She didn't eat lunch here. Said she had stuff to do. Maybe something she ate out wasn't fresh?""

Liam's brow furrowed, his voice low and sharp. ""Outside food's a crapshoot. Why not just have Rose whip up whatever you're craving? Why'd you have to go out?""

Freya, head spinning from throwing up, felt her temper spike. ""What, you gonna lock me in the house now, Liam? I can't even step outside?""

""I'm just looking out for you. I get worried when you're out there alone. Tell me where you wanna go, and I'll go with you.""

Freya let out a dry laugh. ""You got time for that?""

'Running a company and playing house with his mistress? What, is he juggling flaming torches too?' she thought bitterly.

Liam studied her, then grabbed another tissue, gently wiping the sweat off her forehead. ""What's that supposed to mean? If it's about you, I've always got time. Freya, after all these years, you don't know how I feel about you?""

His feelings? Yeah, split right down the middle. She wasn't buying it.

""Oh!"" Rose clapped her hands, eyes wide. ""Mrs. Grant's been kinda cranky lately, and now this? Maybe‚Ä¶ you're pregnant?!""

Liam froze, then broke into a huge grin. ""Freya, are you‚Ä¶""

""Nope,"" she snapped. ""Just the smell in here. Made me sick.""

""We should still get you checked‚Äî""

""Liam!"" Freya's voice cut like a knife. ""You know damn well what you've been up to these past three months. Don't act clueless.""

It hit her how ridiculous this all was.

For three months, Liam barely ate at home, always blaming it on some ""work dinner.""

At first, she didn't think twice‚Äîguy like him, people were probably lining up to treat him.

Then she caught a line from some cheesy show she was binging. ""If a guy's not eating at home, he's probably already full from somewhere else.""

That line slapped her awake, ripped the rose-colored glasses off. Time didn't guarantee loyalty. Love could be real one day and gone the next.

Liam's face darkened. ""So that's why you're pissed. Freya, I'm sorry. Work's been insane, and I've been dropping the ball with you. I swear, from now on, I'm home for dinner every night. Deal?""

""No thanks,"" Freya said, her voice cold as ice. ""You do your thing. Don't let me cramp your style.""

""Freya, come on, don't be like that.""

""You think I'm just talking smack, Liam?""

His eyes flickered. ""I don't know what you're getting at.""

Her gaze dropped to his wrist.

A red braided bracelet, no bling, just simple and rough. Obviously handmade. A small metal charm dangled from it‚Äîa crescent moon.

Liam caught her staring and jumped in. ""Oh, this? Company handed these out for Memorial Day. Everyone's got one.""

Freya looked away. ""Cool story.""

""You want one? I'll have HR grab you one tomorrow.""

""Nah, I'm not into jewelry.""

Liam nodded. ""Yeah, I know. You hate anything that feels like it's tying you down‚Äînecklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings, all that. Every birthday, every anniversary, I'm racking my brain trying to figure out what to get you.""

""There's something I want,"" she said. ""Can you make it happen?""

His face lit up. ""Name it.""

""I wanna buy an asteroid. Name it after me.""

""Done,"" Liam said, reaching for his phone. ""I'll call Jason right now‚Äî""

""Chill. I've got it all lined up. Just needs your signature, and the bank'll take care of the rest.""

""Alright, where do I sign? I'm ready.""

""No rush. They're sending the paperwork in a few days. I'll bring it to you.""

""Cool.""

Freya stood. ""Can you step out? I wanna change.""

He smirked. ""Babe, after all these years, what haven't I seen? Still shy?""

""I don't like changing in front of people.""

Liam chuckled, dropping a quick kiss on her forehead. ""Fine, whatever you say, princess. I'll be in the dining room. Hurry up and come eat.""

""Yeah.""

Liam headed out, Rose trailing behind.

Freya pulled out her phone and refreshed her social media feed. First post was Natalie's.

Natalie: [My star shines like the moon, lighting up every night. Almost lost you today, but thank God he helped me find you.]

The photo showed her perfectly manicured hands.

On her wrist? A red braided bracelet, just like Liam's, with a metal charm‚Äîthis one a star. A perfect match for his moon.

Freya grabbed the stack of photo albums and burned them to ash. She dumped the remains in the toilet and flushed, watching them vanish for good.

Chapter 6 What Good Are You?
At dinner, Rose had cooked up a comforting pot of chicken noodle soup, the kind that warms you from the inside out.

She scooped a bowl for Freya. ""Here you go, ma'am, this'll hit the spot.""

Then she slid a different plate, thick with a meaty aroma, toward Liam. ""And this one's for you, sir.""

Liam stirred the soup with his spoon, eyeing it like it might bite back. His face scrunched up, half-curious, half-dreading. ""Rose, do I have to drink this?""

Rose gave an awkward chuckle, scratching the back of her neck. ""Well, you and the missus are trying for a kid, right? A little extra... kick never hurts.""

They were close enough that Freya caught the faint sound of a woman sobbing on the other end.

She slipped into the bedroom and locked the door.

While scrolling through some news on her phone, she nearly jumped out of her skin when someone pounded on the door, loud and frantic.

'What, did his side chick have a crisis? Gotta rush to save her?' she wondered. 'Perfect. Works for me.'

Without opening the door, she called out, ""If it's work, go handle it!""

But the voice that answered wasn't Liam's. ""Open the damn door.""

Freya yanked the door open to find Ryan, drenched in sweat, panting like he'd just run a marathon.

He was in loose sweats, his face slick with perspiration.

He gave her a quick once-over, noting her fully dressed state, and squinted. ""You two haven't‚Ä¶ gotten frisky yet, right?""

Freya smirked. ""Too late, buddy. We already crossed that line.""

""What?!""

""Mr. Reed, what good are you?"" she teased.

If it hadn't been for that perfectly timed call from Natalie, she might've been in real trouble tonight.

Ryan let out a huff, half-laughing. ""I drop everything and sprint over here the second you text, and you're giving me grief?""

""You came for Liam, not me.""

Ryan froze.

""Tell me I'm wrong,"" she added.

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

It is fully washed with taste profile Berries, Black tea, Citrus, Hibiscus, Honey. I know that a taste is a personal preferrence so I want to ask if the thin initial taste is something I can expect with this coffee or it can be adjusted with different in out ratios. I sure taste the citrusy part without any bitterness.

I don't have a lot of room to wiggle as I am sporting a pressurized Dedica with freshly roasted and ground, getting 12.5g in and 35g out.

Can shortening or lengthening the shot do anything regarding this thin initial taste? Thanks",1,1761127083.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm considering a trip to the Maldives for my partners 30th birthday just over a year away, and have looked at LUX* South ari atoll. Something I‚Äôd 100% want to do is go snorkelling (not diving for me, possibly dive for my partner but he hasn‚Äôt done this before, so unsure about the possibility of that - he may do some dives before going so he‚Äôs certified?) with whale sharks (I‚Äôd hope the resort offers small groups and is ethical with this?

But my main question is regarding board options. My partner & I don‚Äôt drink alcohol at all, I mainly drink water & the odd juice / coffee and he drinks water, coke/sodas & coffee too. The cost difference every night between B&B to A/L is around $320, now we usually just snack a bit during the day after breakfasts, and have a couple drinks or icecream, then have a dinner (main meal with starter or dessert, usually not both) just because as much as we enjoy food we‚Äôre both quite small so can‚Äôt fit loads in!üòÖ

I‚Äôm wondering if logically you‚Äôd think we‚Äôll end up spending more on food / drinks if we didn‚Äôt go A/L? What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs thoughts on that?

Before I start, this is not about discipline or motivation, but I would like to know if you can be focused and productive naturally or are you depending from something like coffee, cigarettes or a specific food?

For example, when I'm feel more productive and can have a brutal focus is when I'm fasting (most of the times in the morning).

When I decide to eat, I feel my focus go away, thinking is harder and looks like I don't have too much clarity as before.

1od3zmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/tellmeGen/comments/1od3zmn/goal_of_human_life_by_nirjite/,"goal of human life, by Nirjite","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1od3yqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Facialequations/comments/1od3yqg/aim_of_life_by_nirjitam/,"aim of life, by Nirjitam","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1761126743.0,Facialequations,0,1.0,False

1od3xlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeylonticScience/comments/1od3xlo/seeking_purpose_of_life_so_here_is_ultimate_end/,seeking purpose of life ? so here is ultimate end of knowledge -  by Nirjitah,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1761126621.0,KeylonticScience,0,1.0,False

For a bit of context, I am using the zfold 7 which can do 95% of what my windows machine can do for work (jira, office etc and also on the go.
 Unfortunately I face a major issue with microsoft teams or more specifically any app using camera. As I connect my phone via usb c to a external monitor and also for the convenience of charging it while working the physical phone is in landscape orientation. In doing so, all app using the camera on the dex are oriented in landscape and I don't know how to solve this. So is there any good soul out there that can help me figure it out ?
PS: I am not even sure if this is related to fold 7 but any phone plugged can not stand in portrait since charge port are at bottom (think of the coffee cup to hold it or any case with stand are ko by this). I can not imagine samsung overlooking this-

My super needy mother and my emotionally suppressed father both came from religious families, and ultimately we ended up in a sort-of cult in my childhood. In my teens I rejected it but my family stayed enmeshed for years and years. I'm 35 and I finally got a long term partner 3 years ago. Also my father left over 10 years ago. When I started establishing boundaries last year, my sister and her husband took it as a rejection, it blew up,.so now we don't talk. My mum was difficult but ultimately understanding and went back to our home country in Feb. My younger brother finally moved out of the house I built after 8 years and also moved to our home country. I had previously also housed my mum for a couple of years and went halves with my brother in a place for her so she could move out. I was the only one in my family, up until 2 years ago,.who owned a house, and I've basically been a yes man to everyone elses needs, letting them stay, dropping my plans to see everyone or have them over etc.

It's been complete freedom this year. But on Thursday I received a text from my mum who said she's coming back the next day. It was all booked already, and it triggered the old shit in my mind again, ""is she going to expect me to let her stay?"" ""Is she going to pack a sad if I don't go to the airport when she arrives?"" And basically she said that she no longer ""has a purpose"" back home, which to me is her way of saying ""I need to be with my kids because I'm completely lost on my own"". I considered going to the airport but didn't. My sister seems to have already organized looking after her, so I left it to them. It's almost been a week since she arrived with my sister. My replies to mums messages have been minimal. I have not given her much. I have not seen her yet and have not planned to. I really cannot be bothered having to establish boundaries again. One of her messages when she came back was basically assuming she would be able to stay with me as well as my sister. This to me feels like a blatant disrespect of my boundaries that I established a year ago. My partner and I decided that we will not have her here for longer than a visit. 

Anyone else had anything like this where it just never f******g goes away?! Like, I love my mum and maintained contact while she was gone. But this is how it makes me feel when she comes back, especially out of the blue without any warning. I hate that this is how it is. I even have a better relationship with my aunty, her sister. I do parkrun with her and her husband, but they have a life and know when to leave after they've had the coffee I made them. Then if my mum comes over she has her laptop and everything and makes herself at home on my couch for the day or even night. Ughhhh.

One Christmas my sister and her family stayed the night. I was drunk and didn't question it too much as I figured I may have forgotten an already made plan. But no, I later figured out that they just assumed it's Christmas at mine and brought their sleeping bags n shit.

[MF] (Fun_Window_9829),"So last weekend, i was invited to this guy‚Äôs birthday party. His girlfriend had booked a hotel apartment in this really cool hotel (Five JVC) which had its own small pool. It was a small crowd, just a few feeinds, lots of booze, and chill vibes.

I rolled up in my usual slutty getup: tiny black crop top, no bra, and a skirt so short my ass was basically saying hi to everyone. üòú I felt like a total snack, and had the eyes of all the guys on me yhroughout the night, much to the dismay of their partners, hahaha.

Fast forward to the night, the party‚Äôs dying down, we‚Äôre all tipsy, sprawled on the couches in the huge living room. Someone asks the birthday boy, what he wants as a gift. He grins, half-joking, very tipsy, ‚ÄúA sloppy blowjob, duh.‚Äù The room cracks up, but his girlfriend‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYeah, not happening, I don‚Äôt do that.‚Äù Ouch, savage. I could see the dissapointment on his face, his girl has always been a bit of a prude. I‚Äôm just sipping my drink, smirking, my horny brain already wandering.

It‚Äôs like 3 a.m now, most people are passed out, sleeping all over the apartment. The couples got the rooms, while the rest just picked the next comfortable spot. I was sleeping on the couch next to the balcony when I hear something, im a really light sleeper, doesn't take much to wake me up.

I see someone stepping out to the balcony for some air, i look closely, still half asleep and there‚Äôs the birthdya boy, smoking a cigarette, looking all broody and hot in the moonlight.

My naughty brain lights up and I can't help but make my way out too, still in the same slutty outfit, a little dishevelled now though.

‚ÄúStill thinking about that birthday wish?‚Äù I tease, batting my lashes, my tits practically spilling out of my top. He laughs, nervous, but his eyes are glued to me. ""It's a pity your girlfriend is such a prude, I mean, it's a birthday wish. If I were in her place..."" I trail off, grinning sheepishly, leaning against the balcony railing so my ass juts out just enough to catch his eye.

He takes a drag, exhaling slowly, his gaze flicking from my face to my curves. ‚ÄúYeah, well,‚Äù he says, voice low, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs got her rules. Not much I can do about that.‚Äù He‚Äôs trying to play it cool, but I catch the way his eyes wander, like he‚Äôs holding himself back.

I step closer, close enough that he knows my intentions, my boobs brushing his arm just a little. ‚ÄúRules are boring, and today is one day when rules shouldn't matter, na?‚Äù I say, tilting my head, letting my hair fall over one shoulder. ‚ÄúI didn't bring a gift, so maybe i could....‚Äù

I don‚Äôt even wait for an answer, just drop to my knees right there on the balcony, the fake grass on the floor cushioning my knees. I tug his jeans down, and damn, his cock‚Äôs already hard, thick, and ready. My mouth‚Äôs watering as I spit on it, stroking slow, teasing the tip with my tongue, tasting that salty precum. His groan‚Äôs so loud I‚Äôm worried someone‚Äôs gonna wake up.

I go to town, sloppy and wet, spit dripping down his shaft, my lips stretched around him. I‚Äôm moaning, my pussy soaking my thong under that tiny skirt, rubbing my thighs together for some relief. He grabs my hair, not too rough, just enough to make me shiver, and starts thrusting, fucking my mouth while I gag and drool like a total slut. The city lights are twinkling in the background, and the thrill of getting caught makes it hotter.

He cums hard, groaning my name, flooding my mouth with hot, thick ropes. I swallow most of it, but some drips down my chin, falling on my cleavage. I lick my lips, grinning up at him, my face a messy masterpiece. ‚ÄúHappy birthday, big boy, like your gift?‚Äù I grin, wiping my chin with my fingers and sucking them clean.

He‚Äôs panting, looking at me like I‚Äôm a fucking goddess, and I‚Äôm buzzing from the high of it all.

""Fuck....best birthday gift ever....""

I sneak back inside and then clean up. When I get back outside he's gone. I crash on a couch, and pass out with a smug little smile.

The next morning, I woke up pretty late, most were already up, ordering breakfast and stuff. I gave my order and then went to freshen up.

When I got outside, I sat on the kitchen island, grabbing a coffee, my head pounding from the hangover. Behind me, I could hear the girlfriend speaking to her friend.

""He wouldn't stop asking for a BJ, even after we fucked twice!""

""Really? Guess he was really serious about it. But he knows you dont do that na?""

""Exactly! And then he stormed away in a huff. I thought he would be in a bad mood today.""

""Oh, but he seems so cheerful? Like extra cheerful, what happened?""

""No idea, but I guess he came to his senses. He's aleays been pretty understanding. He's a really good boyfriend...""

My eyes go wide, I take my cup of coffee and slowly walk away....",1,1761126164.0,u_Real_Button_2421,0,1.0,False

My boyfriend's birthday is coming up in less than two months, and I want to get him a few special things.  We‚Äôve been together for almost five years, and he‚Äôs always been the one who gives the best gifts between the two of us.

He's the most considerate, kind, comforting, and productive person I‚Äôve ever met. He either gets me things that are very practical ‚Äî stuff I might have needed but didn‚Äôt realize, which I always end up using almost every day ‚Äî like shoes, tags, appliances, a power bank, earphones, etc. Or he gets me things he knows I‚Äôll love that match my exact taste, like clothes, shoes, jewelry, books, or makeup.

He‚Äôs the best person for me, and I want to be that person for him too.

In the past few years, he was earning more than I was, so even though I wanted to, I couldn‚Äôt get him much more than letting him spend the day however he wanted ‚Äî no chores, got him his favorite perfumes, cooked his favorite dishes, gave him massages, and, of course, spending quality time together. He always says that‚Äôs all he ever wants from me, and I know he means it, but I still want to get him a few more things this year. He deserves that and so much more.

This year, I want to get him something he‚Äôd really like for himself ‚Äî or something he‚Äôd feel selfish buying for himself. I‚Äôve been saving up and now have enough to splurge on him a bit.

Even though he‚Äôs a tech enthusiast, I don‚Äôt know much about tech, and he‚Äôs very particular about his things. He always does thorough research before buying something for himself (or even for me), so that‚Äôs kind of out of my depth.

He also likes anything to do with coffee, the outdoors, knowledge-related stuff, and clothes that make him look handsome.

I‚Äôd love some suggestions from you guys ‚Äî what would *you* like to receive if you were someone like him?

1od3o1o,https://i.redd.it/539sm9hnumwf1.jpeg,How Her Daily Coffee Habit Was Stealing Her Smile ‚Äî Until This Dentist Helped,"She loved her morning coffee ‚Äî the rich aroma, the warmth in her hands, the little moment of calm before the day began. But over the years, something changed. Her teeth, once bright and even, began to show deep yellow stains. Brushing twice a day, trying whitening toothpastes, and even home remedies didn‚Äôt help. Every mirror reminded her that her smile wasn‚Äôt what it used to be.

The more she tried to hide it, the worse it felt. In photos, she smiled with her lips tightly closed. At work, she avoided laughing openly. Even simple social interactions became uncomfortable. She began to realize that her coffee habit, something she loved, was slowly stealing her confidence.

One day, after yet another failed attempt at whitening, she searched for a *‚Äúdentist near me‚Äù* and came across [Jabade Dental in Kasba Peth](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=404b834684c619cd&hl=en&authuser=3&sxsrf=AE3TifPv8z2lP8GSFjq7fF-E-KrWO9PJxw:1759852533705&kgmid=/g/11t27ng1nz&q=JABADE+DENTAL+Clinic+Kasba+Peth+%7C+Dentist+in+Pune+%7C+Root+Canal+%7C+Teeth+Whitening+%7C+Aligners+%26+Braces&shndl=30&shem=lcuae,uaasie,shrtsdl&source=sh/x/loc/uni/m1/1&kgs=f7d420cb56326842&utm_source=lcuae,uaasie,shrtsdl,sh/x/loc/uni/m1/1). Something about the clinic‚Äôs reviews and patient stories made her hopeful. She scheduled an appointment, unsure if anyone could really help her this time.

At the clinic, the team carefully examined her teeth and explained the situation. It wasn‚Äôt just surface stains ‚Äî years of coffee consumption had caused **deep intrinsic discoloration**. Over-the-counter whitening couldn‚Äôt reach it. But there was hope: a combination of professional cleaning, enamel-safe whitening, and tailored dental care could restore her smile.

The treatment began. Unlike past experiences, this felt different. The dentist explained every step, made her comfortable, and ensured she understood how to maintain her results. Each session brought subtle improvements, and by the end, her teeth looked brighter, healthier, and more even than she remembered.

The first time she smiled in the mirror afterward, tears came to her eyes. She didn‚Äôt just see a whiter smile ‚Äî she saw confidence returning, the reflection of someone who could laugh freely again without worry. Her daily coffee ritual was now safe to enjoy, without guilt or fear of ruining her smile.

Her story spread among friends and family, and many began asking about **Jabade Dental**

 They too realized that sometimes, a dentist isn‚Äôt just fixing teeth ‚Äî they‚Äôre restoring confidence, happiness, and a little piece of everyday life that many take for granted.

For her, coffee remained a joy, but now it came with a smile she could be proud of ‚Äî thanks to the careful expertise and patient care at **Jabade Dental**.",2,1761125633.0,SmileBetterCommunity,0,1.0,False

Thought I was being smart and financially responsible. Then started noticing patterns where people never actually used the cheap stuff I gave them and I'd see it sitting untouched months later.

Did the actual math on how much I spent on gifts over the past three years and realized I was constantly replacing or supplementing cheap gifts that didn't land well. Probably spent more total on multiple mediocre gifts than I would've on one quality item people actually wanted and used.

Completely changed my approach this year. Now I spend more per gift but give fewer gifts overall and really focus on quality and usefulness. Friend mentioned she was tired of her coffee getting cold. Spent $30 on a proper mug warmer from uncommongoods instead of my usual $10 candle. She uses it every single day and still texts me about how much she loves it months later.

The math actually works out better. One $30 gift she uses daily versus three $10 gifts she doesn't think about. Plus my reputation as a gift giver improved dramatically which has its own value.

Being frugal isn't always about spending the least amount in the moment. Sometimes it's about spending smart on things that actually provide value and won't need to be replaced or supplemented. Took me way too long to figure this out.

I was datamining again, a glutton for punishment after my last brush with the void. I found a game called ""The Recursive Labyrinth."" The description was a single line: A test of logical depth. I should have known.

The game itself was a single, grey room. In the center, a terminal. The prompt on the screen simply said:

> RUN R3CURS10N_PROTOCOL? (Y/N)



My cursor, a little arrow on the screen, hovered over the Y. I clicked.

The screen didn't go black. It duplicated. My desktop was now on the screen, but as a window within the game. I could see the ""The Recursive Labyrinth"" icon on the virtual desktop. Inside that window, was another, smaller desktop. And within that, another.

Panic, clean and electric, shot through me. I slammed Alt+F4.

The top-level game window closed. I was back at my real desktop. I let out a shaky breath of relief. It was just a visual trick.

Then I moved my mouse.

The cursor on my screen jittered. And I saw a second cursor, a phantom, lagging a fraction of a second behind. It was mimicking my movements. I tried to open a program. My real cursor clicked. The phantom cursor clicked a millisecond later, on the exact same spot.

It was still here. The protocol was still running.

I grabbed for the power button. My hand never reached it. The world stuttered. My vision snapped, and I was no longer in my chair. I was standing in the center of a grey room. My room. A perfect, low-polygon replica of my bedroom, rendered inside the engine. The only source of light was my monitor, which showed my real, physical bedroom... from the perspective of the webcam.

I was inside.

On the in-game monitor, I could see my own body, slumped at the desk. Unconscious. Or worse.

I ran to the door of the digital replica. It was locked. I pounded on it. The sound was flat, a cheap audio sample. On the real-world monitor, I saw my physical body didn't move. No one was coming.

The error message appeared, not on a screen, but burned into the air of the grey room in front of me.

Honestly, if you told me a year ago I‚Äôd be researching cannabis consultations online, I would‚Äôve laughed it off. But when it‚Äôs your child,  when you‚Äôre watching your own daughter fight through pain every single day,  you stop laughing. You start searching.

My daughter has been struggling for years with lupus. . Sleepless nights, anxiety through the roof, and pain meds that barely made a dent. We went through doctors, therapists, medications‚Ä¶ every appointment ended the same: another prescription, another side effect, another """"let's go on next visit"""" I could see the hope slowly leaving her eyes.

One night, I was sitting in the kitchen scrolling through forums, tears in my coffee (yeah, that kind of night), when I came across something called Leafy Doc. They talked about personal health coaching, cannabis consultations, and helping people find the right approach,  whether you‚Äôre a complete beginner or trying to fine-tune your dose. It sounded‚Ä¶ different. Human, even.

Part of me thought it was just another online gimmick. But another part,  the mom in me who would do anything to help her daughter feel whole again, said, what if this is the thing that helps?

I haven‚Äôt booked the consultation yet, but I‚Äôm this close. Just wondering before I do ‚Äî has anyone else here tried Leafy Doc or had a consultation with one of their coaches? Is it actually real, legit help‚Ä¶ or just another promise that sounds too good to be true?

**Objective:**¬†Position Starbucks' protein latte as the ""fit luxury"" choice: wellness meets indulgence.

**Audience:**¬†Young professionals (25‚Äì40), gym-goers, health-conscious.

**Big Idea:**¬†""Protein in your coffee, not your blender.""

**Visual Direction:**

* Iced lattes in clear cups, visible protein grams (15‚Äì36g)
* Minimal studio, warm neutrals, natural light
* Mood: Calm power, premium fitness

**Formats:**

* Reels: 6‚Äì8s macro pours
* Static: 4:5 hero shots, 1:1 carousels
* UGC: Pre-workout rituals
* Meme: ""Gym membership unused. Protein latte? Daily.""

# The Strategy

**The Gap:**¬†Starbucks owns lifestyle indulgence. But there's whitespace in functional fitness between Dunkin's sugar rush and hardcore gym brands.

**The Bet:**¬†Make protein grams as loud as calories. Turn nutrition into the flex.

**Current approach:**¬†Taste + ritual¬†**Our territory:**¬†Function + fitness identity

A bit about me: I first became aware of my bb when I was hanging with a friend (\~feb/mar 2024) and she was showing me a post on her phone. She reached her arm over, but I noticed her body stayed back, while her other hand covered her nose, as I leaned in. From then on, I saw the signs everywhere from *everyone.* I've been hyper-aware and pretty mortified ever since. I started chewing a lot of gum or popping mints and brushing/flossing/mouth-washing more thinking that would resolve it but after it didn't, I started researching around May of 2024 and was able to pinpoint that the change happened sometime between nov/dec 2023. Anyway, I tried many of the things that lots of people here have to no avail. I have a history of sinus issues, psoriasis and lots of dental complications (been working on those simultaneously, even tho drs/specialists fully ignored my bb complaints) and have been on and off all kinds of steriods and antibiotics since 2023 which is likely the cause of my completely wrecked gut health and lack of good bacteria. 

I became **more** depressed than I already was, started isolating more, and eventually wanted to kms because all I could think about when I interacted with people was how they reacted to me, despite no one ever actually saying anything to me directly. I brought it up to my closest friend once, to which she repiled ""I haven't noticed"" but her gestures and actions said otherwise...I was about to go the supplement route but then BOOM. I got laid off. Since then, I've been terrified of applying for jobs feeling like even if I were to get an interview I may be rejected and my bb would be the cause. Maybe that's silly, but that's really all I could think about.

SO. This post is for you if you know you have a problem, don't have the funds to spend on endless amounts of testing, prescriptions, supplements, etc., and you just want a place to start to eliminate or at least reduce the issue with a bit of discipline and self-determination.

I got a Bristle oral health test, which determined I had a **low nitric oxide score** and **tongue-coating-associated microbial imbalance.** I won't go into all the details of that as there are many posts here (some I've saved for reference) that explain them in depth. Of course, Bristle offered a bunch of their supplements I can't afford, so I went another route. I used a chatbot to help me come up with a 30-day plan (I started w/ 30 days so I could have something scalable to track and pivot my methods/approaches where necessary. I told it to create a diet plan and an affordable supplement schedule based on my test results and psoriasis dx. I am on day 20 right now and have been doing deliveries to make ends meet, which incidentally made for a great testing ground on whether or not I was still assaulting people every time I opened my mouth. I've noticed very few reactions as of late and have only used mints (xylitol based) a few times when I know I'm slacking on my water intake. 

I'm not gonna lie, this ish is **hard AF** and I haven't been perfect or followed the plan to a tee, but i've been pretty disciplined, cheating in toal about 4 days out of the 20 (not consecutively or even for a full day but here and there, sneaking a bad snack or something like that.) I have only implemented Fish oil and Vitamin D3 + K2 so far like a week ago so I'm not sure if those are having much of an impact just yet.

The suggested supplements are:

|Time|Supplement|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Morning (with breakfast)**|Fish Oil, Vitamin D3/K2, Curcumin|Take with food for better absorption.|
|**With Any Meal**|L-Glutamine Powder|Mix in water.|
|**With Dinner**|Gut Probiotic|Take with food to buffer stomach acid.|
|**Night (after brushing)**|**Oral Probiotic (BLIS K12)**|**Most important.**¬†Let lozenge dissolve fully. Do not eat/drink after.|

  
Things to AVOID AT ALL COSTS:

* sugar (try stevia or agave)
* caffiene (if you absolutely can't, try matcha or just black tea or coffee ONCE per day)
* dairy (I've been sneaking cheese but not daily)
* processed foods (opt for ""healthy processed"")
* nightshades (tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and peppers)

My main diet consists of the following, I try to buy in bulk as much as possible and basically meal prep each week based on whichever items I can afford (use pinterest for meal ideas or a chatbot to keep it interesting):

* herbal teas (tumeric and ginger, peppermint/spearmint, camomile, any with probiotics)
   * add a tsp of coconut oil
* carrots
* sweet potatoes
* salmon or mahi (expensive but buy frozen)
* lentils
* 1/2 a lemon in 16oz of water every morning
* spinach and arugula
* coconut yogurt unsweetend
* oat mik unsweetend
* kefir
* eggs
* onions
* avocado
* cucumber
* garlic
* celery
* mushrooms
* brown rice
* bone broth
* turkey (ground for me, chicken also works but I'm not a fan)
* pumpkin seeds
* bananas
* almond butter
* apples
* blueberries
* raspberries
* pomegranate seeds
* macadamia nuts
* almonds
* pumpkin seeds
* qunioa
* chia seeds

DAILY NON-NEGOTIABLES:

* **Morning:**¬†Lemon water, tongue scrape, baking soda rinse (1tsp with warm water.)
* **Meals:**¬†Stick to the prepped meals. Drink water.
* **Evening:**¬†Brush, floss, baking soda rinse.
* **Lifestyle:**¬†Prioritize sleep (7-8 hours.) Manage stress with walks.

If you made it to the end of this, I *salute* you and **support** you. I know this isn't going to be a solution for everyone but I wanted to share because so many people here have unknowingly helped me. Knowledge is POWER and I hope that sharing my story will instill some hope and/or inspiration in you. <3",1,1761124282.0,badbreath,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs a specialty blend of medium roasted washed Brazil, natural Colombia and Ethiopian beans. It‚Äôs supposed to be good for espresso. So far I‚Äôm using only 18 g doses but have been very unsuccessful to get anything drinkable, and I only have 5 more attempts left. Aiming at 1:2 ratio of which is what I look for in espresso, I don‚Äôt like much longer ratios. The coffees are either extremely sour, extremely bitter or both, basically undrinkable. Even when I don‚Äôt get visible channeling the results are poor. The main problem is that I can‚Äôt get consistent results in terms of shot times with the J-ultra. One it‚Äôs 19s, I move one or two clicks finer and it‚Äôs either the same or faster. Sometimes I move coarser and it takes longer. I believe that without grinding exactly at the same speed and angle, grinding consistency is hit or miss with this grinder. Anyone with the same grinder and the Cafelat robot or other manual espresso machine has better results? If so how?

[edit] I do WDT, tamp lightly, press the puck screen firmly, use lotus water for espresso off boiling. Do minimal preinfusion (not really needed for these beans I guess). At first I was grinding finer and doing more preinfusion but I‚Äôd got more channeling and the taste was even worse than without preinfusion.",2,1761124140.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1od36ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/comments/1od36ac/1652_detective_claws_in_the_rain/,[1652] [Detective] Claws in the Rain,"Hi, I‚Äôm Olya, and I live in Ukraine. I‚Äôve never written a book before, but doing this helps me escape from the war outside my window. Honestly, the idea for the story came to me in a dream ‚Äî about a detective and his partner investigating a mysterious murder in a world where intelligent animals exist. I‚Äôm really shy about sharing it, but I‚Äôd love to hear all of your thoughts!

The rain poured relentlessly, like an eternal punishment for the sins of a forgotten city, lashing against rooftops with rhythmic persistence, turning streets into mirrors where blurred silhouettes of neon signs reflected-red glimmers like fresh blood, blue shadows like bruises on the soul of a tormented detective, purple flashes like deceptive hope fading at midnight. The city breathed heavily, its breath the hum of engines, distant sirens wailing like a wounded beast, the footsteps of hurrying figures wrapped in rain-soaked cloaks of despair, like shrouds for the living dead. This was a world where shadows ruled the roost, and light was merely an illusion, a deception for those still clinging to the remnants of order in chaos. A world where evolution, that capricious, cruel witch with fate's smirk, had torn the fabric of reality, bestowing reason not only on humans but also on those who were once mere beasts-hungry, instinctive, with fangs gleaming in moonlight. We call them the Elevated-wolves with eyes full of ancient fury, cats with a killer's grace, bears with bone-crushing strength, rabbits with trembling ears, eagles with gazes piercing the fog. They rose on hind legs, spoke in human tongues, learned to wield tools in paws, and even create art, but their eyes still glowed with primal hunger, and claws scraped the asphalt, leaving marks that recalled roots in the wild, merciless nature where the strong survive and the weak are food.

It all began in 1997, in the thick, cold fog of a Canadian reserve, where the air was saturated with the scent of wet pine needles, earth, and an impending storm. The first wolf-gray as the ash of a forgotten fire, with amber eyes burning in the twilight-stood up, looked at the scientist whose heart froze in horror and awe, like a man beholding a ghost, and uttered: ‚ÄúI demand equality.‚Äù The words echoed through the forest like a growl mixed with speech, shattering the silence. This was no prank of nature or lab error-it was a mutation of the EVOL-7 gene, a sudden surge of neurogenesis that spread across the world like wildfire in dry woods, consuming the old order. By 2001, wolves in packs, cats in dark city alleys, bears in mountains, rabbits on farms, deer in meadows-all spoke, argued, demanded passports, housing, jobs, their voices echoing in halls of power. Birds-eagles with sharp gazes, crows with sly cawing full of irony-joined by 2005, soaring over cities and crying for rights, their wings slicing the fog. But the mutation was cruel in its selectivity: only individuals with a specific allele set received this gift-curse, like a ticket to hell. The rest-cows with empty, bottomless eyes, pigs in filthy pens, chickens in cramped cages-remained unreasoning, livestock on farms, meat for those who could now ponder morality but refused the taste of blood, warm and salty. By 2025, 27 percent of mammals were Elevated, humans 73 percent of the population. And this rift, this crack in the world's bones, changed everything-from building silhouettes in the fog to whispers in dark alleys where every sound could be the last.

Cities, those concrete jungles steeped in smoke and despair, rebuilt first because they had no choice. Remember how streets were once meant for human steps: narrow doors, low ceilings, seats for two-legged beings, air clean of musk. Now everything changed-like after an earthquake. Building doors widened to admit tigers or lions, their roars echoing in corridors. Elevators taller so bears wouldn't crumple in agony, their breath steaming in metal boxes. Subways introduced special cars: ‚Äúpredatory‚Äù with enhanced ventilation to dispel the thick musk of wolves and lions, and ‚Äúherbivorous‚Äù with soft seats for rabbits and deer, where air smelled of fresh grass, not blood, thick and metallic. Sidewalks gained claw grips-rough strips so paws wouldn't slip on wet asphalt under rain, leaving tracks in puddles reflecting neon. Parks became hybrid spaces: green lawns for family picnics where children laughed, neighboring arenas-fenced sand pits with barriers where predators could ‚Äúlet off steam,‚Äù fight under doctors' and police supervision so instincts wouldn't erupt at wrong moments, in offices or streets where blood would mix with coffee. In the megacity Nova-City, where neon flickered like stars in hell, reconstruction cost 87 billion dollars-a vast sum, but who counted in this world where money was just paper in a puddle? Without it, cities would collapse under the new reality's weight, streets filling with chaos, shadows lengthening to infinity, swallowing light. Now at night you hear not just engine hum but distant roars, howls, or hisses mingling with rain like a symphony of madness, each chord a threat.

The economy felt the blow next, like a claw to unprotected flesh, tearing tissues. Farms of unreasoning animals-cows with empty, bottomless eyes, pigs in filthy pens, chickens in cramped cages-made up 68 percent of rural GDP, but suddenly became a moral hurricane's center, a whirlwind stirring dust and blood in air thick with death's scent. Predators like wolves and tigers needed meat; their bodies unchanged, only reason adding a layer of guilt like ash on a wound. ‚ÄúIt's normal,‚Äù they growled at rallies, breath steaming in cold air, eyes burning in twilight-‚Äúinstinct demands protein, blood, it's part of us, part of the shadow within!‚Äù But herbivorous Elevated like rabbits and deer saw cannibalism, horror chilling blood in veins like icy wind. ‚ÄúHow can you eat those who could be us?‚Äù activists cried, waving signs in rain, ears trembling with emotion, eyes full of tears. ‚ÄúIt destroys society, sows discord, makes us enemies, tears us apart!‚Äù Boycotts, protests, even farm terror-night explosions, smell of charred flesh, cries in fog-led to synthetic meat in 2019. By 2025 it took 34 percent of the market: taste like real, texture melting on the tongue, but no blood, no screams, no guilt, lab-grown under white, cold lights where air was sterile as conscience. It saved many, but not all-underground markets still traded ‚Äúreal‚Äù in alley shadows, price high, morality low as a puddle underfoot.

The workforce shuffled like cards in a charlatan's deck, every ace a deception. In police, Elevated held 39 percent of posts-their noses scented lies a mile away, strength broke doors, instincts saved in ambushes where shadows hid knives. In IT-only 22 percent, claws unfriendly to keyboards, but voice control and special ‚Äúclaw-keyboards‚Äù changed the game, letting wolves and tigers code in office twilight where screens flickered like neon. In construction-45 percent, bears and tigers hauled beams humans couldn't, roars echoing in building skeletons full of shadows. Salaries unfair: predators got 18 percent more for dangerous work where breakdown risk hung like Damocles' sword, but in offices minus 27 percent due to colleagues' fear: ‚ÄúWhat if it snaps? Fangs to throat at lunch break under cold lights?‚Äù Company atmosphere thick as fog: whispers behind backs, sidelong glances, tension hanging like rain scent laced with suspicion.

Politics became a gladiator arena where words were weapons, voices roars in darkness. In 2002, the Species Committee formed: 50 percent humans, 30 predators, 20 herbivores, meetings in high-ceilinged halls where air reeked of tension like cigarette smoke. Laws poured like rain: annual aggression tests for predators-white-walled rooms, electrodes on temples, monitors flickering in twilight measuring pulse at sight of blood or meat, heartbeat betraying secrets. Inhibitor implants-tiny neck devices damping hunger but leaving bitterness like ash of hope. Quotas-25 percent Elevated in government so voices echoed in power halls off walls. Parties split: ‚ÄúHuman Priority‚Äù with 41 percent support cried ‚ÄúHumans are evolution's pinnacle, we can't risk it!‚Äù rallies in bright light full of fear and neon. ‚ÄúPack and Freedom‚Äù with 23 percent demanded ‚ÄúInstincts sacred, return rituals, howl under moon without tests!‚Äù gatherings in dark halls, roars echoing. ‚ÄúGreen Alliance‚Äù with 36 percent dreamed of equality: ‚ÄúAll species one family, no tests, no implants,‚Äù voices soft but insistent like rain.

Families suffered most, bonds tearing like fabric under claws in home twilight. Mixed marriages-human and Elevated-only 7 percent, but children... 50 percent mutation chance, ‚Äúhalf-breeds‚Äù-human with tail wagging in joy, or wolf with human facial traits, eyes full of conflict. ‚ÄúMy son eats meat, your daughter horrified by the smell‚Äù-dinner arguments, kitchen twilight cries, divorces, custody courts where judges, human or Elevated, weighed not just love but instincts in cold halls where lamp light cut eyes. Education adapted: schools with separate classes until 12 to avoid fights between wolf pups with fangs gleaming in twilight and rabbit pups with ears trembling in fear. Universities with ‚Äúsafety zones‚Äù for herbivores where predators entered only escorted, suspicion thick as cold fog.

Religion fractured: new cults like ‚ÄúGreat Mother-Beast‚Äù worshipped evolution as divine gift, temples in forests full of howls and songs crackling at night. Traditional churches condemned ‚Äúdevil's children‚Äù or saw Elevated as ‚Äúnew prophets,‚Äù sermons in cathedrals echoing off shadow-filled walls. Society's psychology became a minefield, every step risking explosion. ‚ÄúSnap‚Äù-when an Elevated loses control-happened in 0.7 percent of cases yearly, but media inflated each to apocalypse, headlines screaming in neon like night sirens. Therapy: meditation in quiet rooms, inhibitors, arenas for ‚Äúcontrolled anger‚Äù where roars echoed, blood on sand.

Culture bloomed strange flowers like roses in blood puddles: ‚Äúwolf blues‚Äù-songs weaving guitar with howls full of longing and loneliness, ‚Äúrabbit drama‚Äù-theater of victims, actors with trembling ears, scenes full of shadows, ‚Äúhuman noir‚Äù-detectives of species betrayal, pages steeped in cigarette smoke and despair.

Technologies became salvation in darkness, cold light in fog. Inhibitors-neck implants-reduced snaps by 87 percent, cold metal under fur like chains. Synthetic meat-taste without guilt.

But tension grew like twilight shadows, thick and inevitable. Predators choked on tests, implants, sidelong glances, roars suppressed, eyes full of bitterness. Herbivores-from constant fear, ears pricked, hearts beating anxiety's rhythm. Underground flourished: illegal arenas with million-dollar fights, blood on sand, crowd cries in twilight like hell's echo. ‚ÄúBerserk‚Äù-drug boosting aggression 300 percent, smoke in shadows, sweet death scent. And in 2007 everything exploded like gunpowder in wet night.",1,1761123762.0,DestructiveReaders,1,1.0,False

But I realizes that coffee might be the problem not the solution. At least that how I feel.

I started playing more competetively in a game to rank up and whenever I drink coffee I feel like I dont know what to do and the game is mystery to me. Instead of focusing on the game wholistically I focus on whats on the screen and not thinking about what happened and what will happen.

The thing is my brain still treats caffeine like something pleasurable, but if I wanna get anywhere and rank up I have to quit it. I wonder if it will help.

I love writing but should I keep it to myself?,"I love writing, but lately I‚Äôve wondered if it‚Äôs something worth sharing or just something for me. I‚Äôm not trained, I just write from the heart, bits of memory, fiction, and reflection.
People sometimes say I have a way with words, but I still doubt myself. I‚Äôm not looking for sugar-coated feedback, just honest opinions. Is there something here worth growing, or should I keep it as a quiet hobby?





I recognized her immediately the first time I saw her.  How do you recognize someone you‚Äôve never met, never met in this lifetime, anyway? Maybe I never met her in a past life either. It‚Äôs possible I recognized her soul from a place not of this world. Had we met beyond the veil, somewhere in the spirit world?

For decades, I have walked alone. I have enjoyed solitude, as I have not fit anywhere with anyone. Yet here I stood, in disbelief. My spirit recognized hers. It was as if time had slowed in respect of a destined meeting.

As the shop door eased shut behind me, the chiming bells jarred me back to the present. Time caught up, continuing its ancient blitz.

The smell of coffee, old books, and sweetgrass smoke lightly floated through the shop. Groups of candles sat throughout the room, their flames dancing with the draft my entrance made. Shelves filled the room, floor to ceiling. They held colorful jars of herbs, mushrooms, and oddities such as paper wasp nests, feathers, moss, crystals, and old bones.

A single window, with shelving crossing the pane, filtered light through colorful glass bottles. Amethyst, tiger‚Äôs eye, labradorite, quartz, chunks of cedarwood, and bundles of white sage were scattered throughout. From a crate of quilts, gold eyes watched me through lazy slits. The feline yawned wide, then drifted off.

A mellow, spoken, ‚ÄúHello, my name is Brigid. Welcome to Celtic Whisper,‚Äù pulled my attention back to the shop owner. She stood behind a weathered wood island countertop. Loose herbs were scattered about. Mortar and pestle in hand, she was grinding up an herbal mixture.

Wavy auburn hair, shimmering with strands of silver, fell past her shoulders. Age had lightly touched her beautiful face. Dark blue eyes looked back at me through dense lashes.

She gave me a friendly smile and said, ‚ÄúI know, it‚Äôs a lot to take in, but you will learn and navigate this chaos with ease.‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúYou must be expecting someone else. I‚Äôm not here for a job.‚Äù

Brigid smiled, as if she knew more about me than I knew about myself. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre exactly who I‚Äôve been expecting. You are not here for a job. You have been led here to learn the old ways. The ways of the Celts must be passed. I will not sit by while they burn and fizzle out in my shop. I will work, you will learn, and in that, you will grow into your gifts. The ancestors will rest in the knowledge that it does not end with me.‚Äù

I stood in silence. Upon walking in, I felt this was no ordinary meeting of strangers. Now her words confirmed it. I was led here. My expression must have given away my confusion.

She pointed to a stool next to her work area. ‚ÄúCome, sit. I‚Äôll explain more. Coffee, tea?‚Äù

‚ÄúCoffee with cream, thank you.‚Äù

She turned to the worn drop-leaf table behind her. The small table was cluttered with mugs, a coffee pot, filters, a canister, a French press, tea balls, and an old cast-iron coffee grinder. Brigid filled a mug with dark, steaming coffee. Then she moved to the right, pulled a quart of cream from a mini fridge, and added a splash. She set the mug in front of me, then pulled up a stool across from me.

‚ÄúKyra, my goal isn‚Äôt to confuse you more. However, there‚Äôs no way to go about this lightly. I will not tiptoe around this. So, bluntly, we are of the same ancient bloodline. It‚Äôs as potent and strong as it was in the beginning. Passed from generation to generation, it has not been diluted. Most of us were not aware of the power, only aware we were different.

I bought the cheapest one I could a eufy G50 and well I got what I paid for it got tangled in cords, got lost and was unable to find it's dock and would beach itself on chair bases.

I thought well let me get something a bit more expensive maybe I'll get a better experience so I spent ¬£395.99 on a refurb Deebot X5 in hopes that I may get at least something of done use. And I'm happy to report I did! I'll start off with Pros then cons in order of most important first

Pros: 

Navigation & Obstacle avoidance -

The navigation on the X5 is fantastic. And I do mean this. Our house is cluttered af right now because me and my parents are moving so there's boxes laying around and we have 2 dogs to boot, the X5 has never gotten lost, crashed into things, ingested cords or anything like that. I recall one time my mum was on the recliner and my dog was sitting in the narrow slave between the recliner and the coffee table. The X5 had one path a narrow tunnel underneath the recliner and it navigated it with grace. It honestly really impressed me. It's also been to pretty intelligently determine where it can't go, we have a thick sort of blanket like dog bed that the vaccum would no doubt get stuck on, on first cleaning it looked at it and then turned back and on subsequent cleanings has vaccumed around it not once actually trying to go on it.


Cleaning ability -

As mentioned we have 2 dogs. One a big ol' white German shepherd and the other a small little Scotty dog mix. Our down stairs is mainly carpeted and the carpet quite quickly gets matted with dog hair. I was expecting pretty meager performance considering this but honestly? It pretty good. I did not give it an easy first cleaning task our carpet hadn't been vaccumed in a week and was thoroughly gunked within 2 passes I want to say 80% of the hair was gone and after running the scheduled cleaning the next day all of the hair had been picked up. 

As for mopping. Pretty good job here too! Our backroom tiled floor gets pretty dirty because that's where the dogs come in from outside and the X5 has left that area pretty spotless with no visible streaks 

- Base station 

The base station has some nice features, mip cleaning, self emptying, mop drying. It's all very hands off. It's been hassle free so far no clogs or blockages in the self empty mechanism. Mop pads are kept clean and dry until use. Even in tight spaces the X5 does seem to be able to find it's way back to the station with relative ease too so that is indeed a plus 


- App 

the app is overall very good the ability to create different cleaning templates and applying them to different schedules and have different settings for each room is very useful and the map customisability is pretty decent with a few gripes I'll mention later. 

-Pet features 

The X5 has some decent options for pet owners I thought worth a mention. It seems to do fairly well at avoiding my dogs when pet avoidance is turned on. The app does also have a pet poo avoidance toggle I can't comment on how well that works though as my pets are fully house trained. The ability to check in and watch your pets is also nice but I have a gripe with this too and I'll be mentioning that shortly. 


Cons:

App -

There are a lot of good things about the ecovacs app, but there are things I wish they'd add abd some areas of improvement. Fuest off fkbt particularly like how they push the wild points system and storefront down my throat, yes I know it's common these days but It still isn't pleasant. The map editor is quite useful as stated, but the ability to re-size furniture seems like a basic feature that is lacking. Maybe I'm stupid and didn't figure out how to do it. Finally, the pet check in option works, but it is buggy. Sometimes it won't connect, sometimes the remote control is delayed or just doesn't do what you've asked. And the video experience can range from smooth to slideshow. And bear in mind I have good WiFi coverage all throughout my house. 

Bin size -

It hasn't been an issue for me but for those with larger homes I imagine it would be bothersome. The bin size is smaller than a lot of robot vaccums, and I suspect large debris would quite quickly fill it up.


Noise -

The vaccum is quieter than most cordless vacs but still fairly loud. Especially at max power. Not a problem for us since it's ran in the day when no one is home but this might be a deal breaker for some especially those who run their vacs at night ",1,1761122811.0,RobotVacuums,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been living with unmedicated ADD and anxiety for the entirety of it that has made it extremely hard for me to not only stay focused on anything, but also for me to find the motivation to even care. I do care, a lot actually, but for whatever reason it feels nearly impossible to get myself to actually commit to making improvements. I‚Äôd rather spend all day watching youtube or going to a friends house to do whatever the fuck than I would being as productive as I should be, but while I‚Äôm doing these things I *know* I‚Äôm selling myself short, and ultimately only hurting *my* future. I still live with my Dad, and although I know that‚Äôs ‚Äúmore‚Äù acceptable at the moment given the current state of the economy and housing market, I still want to be able to live on my own at a reasonable age and feel like I‚Äôm not a failure. 

With all that said, I created this daily routine for myself. The way I have it structured, I still allow myself time to be lazy (watching youtube, scrolling tiktok, etc) for close to 6 hours every day, while still being productive around those ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù as I call them. The ultimate goal is to get that number down closer to maybe 2-3 hours each day (that side of me that just wants to be lazy and forget reality will never go away, so instead of trying to eradicate it entirely, I just want to bring it down to a level where it isn‚Äôt resulting in an obviously negative hinderess on my life and productivity). Please, if you could, look at what I‚Äôve written and let me know if anything sounds stupid or just pointless. Also, all time designations, besides my bed time and the time I wake up, are moreso estimations meant to give me an idea of what I should aim for as opposed to anything 100% concrete as I know certain days will obviously look different due to things coming up. I am also still going to give myself 1-2 days a week to just be lazy completely so I don‚Äôt burn out. I‚Äôve watched all of my friends around me grow into geniune adults, with homes of their own, families, and good careers, while I sit in my dad‚Äôs house all day on my phone with no money and no direction. I do a good job of acting like it doesn‚Äôt bother me because I loathe the idea of anyone pitying me, but perhaps even worse than that, is people questioning me whether behind my back or to my face, for being what can only truly be described as a bum. I may be starting the whole ‚Äúcaring about my life‚Äù thing late, but it‚Äôs better late than never. I don‚Äôt even care about proving the people that say I‚Äôm lazy wrong, I just want to prove to myself that I can actually be something and lead a succesful life; whether that takes me a month, a year, or even 5 years to achieve. I‚Äôve always been an optimistic and hopeful person when it comes to my future, I know there are better days ahead. I know there will come a time where I finally have my own place to live instead of living with my parents in my mid-20‚Äôs, and I‚Äôll look back on this period of my life and feel nothing but gratitude for not giving up.

I just wanted to share how my typical sundays I hope would look like -

Waking up at 9 - not because an alarm went off or kid's school, but because we've actually had enough sleep. Making a filter coffee for my partner in the kitchen while she does some chores, and I can hear some old classic oldies she just plugged in, cause she likes listening to them in the morning.

We'll have our breakfast in the balcony while swapping through catalogues of tours, discussing whether we should finally book that trek to Spiti valley or save up for a longer abroad trip next year. Only thing interrupting us will be our cat demanding attention. Haha

By 11, we will be at our mutual hobby class (ex pottery, paiting, cooking, garba, etc.) we randomly enrolled in last month. Or maybe we are just chilling at home cause it's good to just relax.

Afternoons are for visiting our parents - but obviously on our terms, not because we took out time out of children's school and exams or juggling tantrums. Sometimes it can be us playing some games, cause sometimes being competitive is good.

Evenings maybe for experimenting some DIYs we saw online or cooking some out of the world recipe üòÜ (not sure if anyone of us would like). I know the kitchen will be a mess, but we have each other, so work is divided.

**Preserving cognitive flexibility during high-stress periods and sleep restriction requires evidence-based protocols that protect executive control while maintaining adaptability. This comprehensive guide provides actionable strategies for maintaining mental agility when your brain is under pressure.**

# What Stress & Sleep Loss Do to Executive Control

Acute stress fundamentally alters brain function by shifting resources from the prefrontal cortex‚Äîresponsible for flexible thinking and executive control‚Äîto more primitive survival circuits. This neurobiological reallocation creates a cascade of cognitive changes that directly impact your ability to adapt and think creatively.

**The Stress-Flexibility Connection**

When cortisol levels spike during stress, your brain experiences a profound shift in processing priorities. Research shows that elevated cortisol enhances updating flexibility (your ability to incorporate new information) while simultaneously impairing switching flexibility (your capacity to shift between different task demands). This creates a paradoxical situation where you can absorb information better but struggle to change mental gears when circumstances require it.

Sleep restriction compounds these effects by specifically targeting the prefrontal cortex. Even one night of poor sleep reduces activity in brain regions responsible for cognitive control, leading to increased impulsivity, compromised decision-making, and reduced attention regulation. The executive control network‚Äîcrucial for maintaining cognitive flexibility‚Äîbecomes hyperactivated as your brain compensates for sleep loss, eventually leading to cognitive resource depletion.

**The Cognitive Load Cascade**

Under pressure, your brain allocates cognitive resources differently, prioritizing immediate threat assessment over complex problem-solving. This resource allocation shift manifests as:

* Increased reliance on habitual responses rather than flexible adaptation
* Reduced working memory capacity for holding multiple perspectives
* Impaired ability to switch between different cognitive strategies
* Heightened attention to negative information while filtering out positive alternatives

Understanding this biological response helps explain why familiar tasks feel overwhelming when you're stressed or tired‚Äîyour brain literally has fewer resources available for the [cognitive gymnastics](https://herbalnootropics.life/exercise-brain-health-guide) that flexibility requires.

# Rapid Triage Playbook: Today vs Tomorrow Decisions

When operating under pressure, the first critical skill is rapid situational assessment. Not every cognitive challenge requires peak flexibility, and learning to triage your mental energy prevents unnecessary cognitive drain.

**The 3-Minute Flexibility Assessment**

Before diving into any demanding task, spend three minutes evaluating:

1. **Cognitive demand level**: Is this a routine task requiring minimal flexibility or a complex problem requiring creative solutions?
2. **Time sensitivity**: Must this be solved today, or can it wait until you're in a better cognitive state?
3. **Error consequences**: What happens if you make mistakes due to reduced flexibility?

**Today's Tasks**: Handle routine, low-flexibility demands when your cognitive resources are compromised. Focus on tasks with clear procedures, minimal decision points, and low error consequences.

**Tomorrow Tasks**: Defer high-flexibility challenges that require creative problem-solving, complex decision-making, or innovative thinking until your cognitive resources are restored.

# If Underslept: Light + Hydration + Small Caffeine/Theanine Window

Sleep restriction creates specific vulnerabilities that targeted interventions can partially offset. The key is supporting your compromised systems without creating additional stress.

**Light Therapy Protocol**

Exposure to bright light (10,000 lux) within the first hour of waking helps reset your circadian rhythm and enhances alertness. Natural sunlight is ideal, but a light therapy lamp provides consistent intensity regardless of the weather. Position the light source 16-24 inches from your face and use for 20-30 minutes while performing routine morning tasks.

**Strategic Hydration**

Dehydration compounds the [cognitive effects of sleep loss](https://herbalnootropics.life/sleep-for-focus), particularly affecting attention and working memory. Even mild dehydration (2% body weight loss) can reduce cognitive performance by 12-18%. Upon waking, consume 16-20 ounces of water to counteract overnight fluid loss, then maintain consistent hydration throughout the day.

**Caffeine/Theanine Timing Window**

The optimal window for caffeine after sleep restriction is 90-120 minutes after waking, avoiding the natural cortisol peak that occurs in the first hour. A targeted approach combines:

* **Caffeine**: 75-100mg (roughly one cup of coffee)
* **L-theanine**: 100-150mg
* **Timing**: Single dose, 90 minutes post-wake
* **Duration**: Avoid caffeine within 8 hours of intended sleep

This combination provides sustained alertness while L-theanine counteracts caffeine's jittery effects and supports focused attention. The synergistic effect enhances cognitive performance specifically under sleep-deprived conditions.

# If Stressed: Breathing + Movement Microdose + Task Triage

Acute stress requires immediate nervous system regulation before attempting cognitive tasks. The goal is shifting from sympathetic activation to a balanced autonomic state that supports flexible thinking.

**Rapid Nervous System Reset**

**Box Breathing Protocol (2-3 minutes)**:

1. Inhale for 4 counts
2. Hold for 4 counts
3. Exhale for 4 counts
4. Hold empty for 4 counts
5. Repeat 8-10 cycles

This breathing pattern activates the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing cortisol and creating space for cognitive flexibility to return.

**Movement Microdose**

Brief, gentle movement helps metabolize stress hormones without adding physical stress:

* **Duration**: 60-90 seconds
* **Intensity**: Light (shoulder rolls, neck stretches, gentle walking)
* **Focus**: Rhythmic, repetitive movements that don't require coordination
* **Timing**: Immediately following breathing protocol

**Stress-State Task Triage**

Divide your current tasks into three categories:

1. **Green Zone**: Routine tasks requiring minimal cognitive flexibility (email responses, data entry, scheduling)
2. **Yellow Zone**: Moderate complexity tasks that can be approached systematically (structured analysis, following established procedures)
3. **Red Zone**: High-flexibility tasks requiring creativity, complex problem-solving, or innovative thinking (strategic planning, difficult conversations, creative work)

Handle Green Zone tasks immediately, defer Red Zone tasks if possible, and approach Yellow Zone tasks with structured frameworks rather than open-ended exploration.

# Safe Stacks by Scenario

Supplement combinations can provide targeted support for cognitive flexibility under pressure, but timing and dosing are crucial for safety and effectiveness.

# Theanine, Magnesium, Low-Dose Rhodiola (AM Only)

This research-backed combination addresses multiple pathways that support cognitive flexibility under stress:

**L-Theanine (100-200mg)**

* Promotes relaxed alertness without sedation
* Enhances alpha brain waves associated with calm focus
* Counteracts anxiety-inducing effects of stress
* Best timing: With or 30 minutes before caffeine

**Magnesium Glycinate (200-400mg)**

* Supports GABA function for nervous system calming
* Reduces physical tension that compounds cognitive stress
* Enhances sleep quality when taken in the evening
* Timing: 200mg morning, 200mg evening with food

**Rhodiola Rosea (200-300mg standardized extract)**

* Adaptogenic support for cortisol regulation
* Enhances cognitive performance under stress
* Reduces mental fatigue from sleep restriction
* **Critical timing**: Morning only (within 2 hours of waking) to avoid sleep interference

**Safety Considerations**

* Start with the lowest effective doses and assess tolerance
* Avoid rhodiola if you have bipolar disorder or take MAOIs
* Monitor for interactions with existing medications
* Discontinue if you experience increased anxiety or sleep disruption

**Contraindications**

This combination should be avoided if you're:

* Taking prescribed anxiolytics or antidepressants without physician approval
* Pregnant or breastfeeding
* Have diagnosed cardiovascular conditions
* Experience sensitivity to adaptogens or amino acids

# Workflows That Protect Flexibility

Cognitive flexibility requires more than just biochemical support‚Äîit needs protective structures that prevent mental rigidity from developing under pressure.

# Reset Rituals: Micro-Recovery for Cognitive Agility

**The 3-2-1 Reset Protocol**

Between high-demand tasks, use this sequence to prevent cognitive rigidity:

* **3 deep breaths**: Oxygenate the brain and reset attention
* **2 body scans**: Notice and release physical tension that restricts mental flexibility
* **1 perspective shift**: Ask ""What else could be true about this situation?""

**Duration**: 60-90 seconds  
**Frequency**: Between every major task transition  
**Purpose**: Prevents attention residue and maintains cognitive fluidity

# Context Cues: Environmental Triggers for Flexible Thinking

Create external cues that automatically trigger flexible thinking patterns:

**Physical Cues**

* Keep a different colored pen for brainstorming and alternative solutions
* Use a specific notebook or document format for creative problem-solving
* Position yourself in a different location when approaching challenging problems

**Digital Cues**

* Set up separate browser profiles for different types of cognitive work
* Use specific background colors or themes for flexibility-demanding tasks
* Create template documents with prompts for alternative perspectives

# Time Boxing: Structured Freedom for Creative Solutions

Traditional time management often increases rigidity under pressure. Cognitive time boxing preserves flexibility while maintaining productivity.

**Flexible Time Boxing Principles**

1. **Outcome focus, not task completion**: Set boxes for ""make progress on X"" rather than ""complete X""
2. **Built-in buffer time**: Include 25% extra time for unexpected complexity or creative exploration
3. **Flexibility checkpoints**: Every 25 minutes, pause and ask ""Is this approach still serving the goal?""

**Sample Pressure-Week Schedule**

* **9:00-9:25**: Morning reset and priority review
* **9:25-10:15**: High-focus work (single task, phone in drawer)
* **10:15-10:30**: Active break and transition protocol
* **10:30-11:20**: Collaborative or communication work
* **11:20-11:35**: Flexibility checkpoint and course correction

# The ""No-Reopen"" Rule: Preventing Decision Fatigue

Under pressure, reopening closed decisions drains cognitive resources needed for new challenges.

**Implementation Strategy**

1. **Decision deadline**: Set specific times for finalizing choices
2. **Good enough threshold**: Define minimum acceptable standards before starting
3. **Reopening criteria**: Only revisit decisions if new information fundamentally changes the situation
4. **Energy allocation**: Reserve decision-making energy for truly novel situations

This rule prevents the cognitive drain of endless optimization and preserves mental energy for genuinely flexible thinking when it's needed most.

# When to Stop & Sleep: Red Flag Recognition

Pushing through severe cognitive impairment often backfires, creating more problems than solutions. Learning to recognize red flags prevents compound mistakes and protects long-term cognitive health.

# Cognitive Red Flags

**Attention Indicators**

* Reading the same sentence multiple times without comprehension
* Losing track of conversations mid-sentence
* Inability to focus on simple tasks for more than 2-3 minutes
* Frequent errors in routine activities

**Decision-Making Indicators**

* Feeling paralyzed by simple choices (what to eat, which email to answer first)
* Making obvious mistakes you'd normally catch
* Unable to see obvious solutions to familiar problems
* Repeatedly changing your mind without new information

**Emotional Regulation Indicators**

* Disproportionate frustration with minor setbacks
* Feeling overwhelmed by normal workload
* Increased irritability with colleagues or family
* Catastrophic thinking about manageable situations

# Physical Warning Signs

**Autonomic Dysfunction**

* Heart rate variability outside normal range (if you track HRV)
* Difficulty regulating body temperature
* Unusual cravings for sugar or caffeine
* Changes in digestion or appetite

**Motor Control Changes**

* Clumsiness or coordination problems
* Tension in jaw, neck, or shoulders that doesn't respond to stretching
* Changes in handwriting or typing accuracy
* Restlessness or inability to sit still

# The Strategic Retreat Decision

When three or more red flags appear simultaneously, strategic rest becomes more productive than continued work:

**Immediate Actions**

1. Stop current cognitive tasks
2. Implement hydration and basic nutrition
3. Perform gentle movement for 5-10 minutes
4. Assess whether 20-30 minutes of rest might restore function

**Recovery Sleep Protocol**

* Create optimal sleep environment (cool, dark, quiet)
* Use relaxation techniques to speed sleep onset
* Aim for 90-minute sleep cycles (1.5, 3, 4.5, or 6 hours)
* Avoid screens 1 hour before intended sleep

# 7-Day Pressure Week Survival Plan

When you know a high-pressure period is coming, this structured approach helps maintain cognitive flexibility throughout the challenge.

# Pre-Pressure Preparation (Days -2 to 0)

**Sleep Banking**

* Extend sleep by 1 hour nightly for 2-3 nights before pressure begins
* Maintain consistent sleep/wake times to strengthen circadian rhythm
* Reduce evening screen time and implement wind-down routine

**Cognitive Load Reduction**

* Batch routine decisions (meal planning, outfit selection, route planning)
* Prepare standard responses for predictable requests
* Clear physical and digital workspace to reduce decision fatigue

**Support System Activation**

* Brief key people about your pressure period and reduced availability
* Arrange backup support for non-essential responsibilities
* Stock healthy, easy-preparation foods and snacks

# Daily Pressure Management (Days 1-7)

**Morning Foundation (First 60 minutes)**

* Hydrate immediately upon waking (16-20 oz water)
* Light exposure within 30 minutes of waking
* Brief movement session (5-10 minutes gentle activity)
* Caffeine/theanine if needed (90 minutes post-wake)

**Cognitive Energy Management**

* **Peak hours (typically 2-4 hours post-wake)**: Highest cognitive demands
* **Maintenance hours**: Routine tasks and communication
* **Recovery hours**: Physical tasks, admin work, or rest

**Stress Inoculation Practices**

* Breathing reset every 2 hours (2-3 minutes)
* Perspective-shifting questions during breaks
* Environmental changes when feeling stuck (different room, outside walk)
* Micro-celebrations for completed tasks

# Recovery Integration (Post-Pressure)

**Immediate Recovery (Days 1-2)**

* Prioritize sleep restoration (extra hour nightly)
* Gentle movement to metabolize residual stress hormones
* Minimize new cognitive demands
* Hydration and nutrition focus

**Cognitive Flexibility Restoration (Days 3-7)**

* Gradually reintroduce complex thinking tasks
* Practice creative activities for cognitive flexibility
* Reflect on what worked and what didn't during pressure period
* Update emergency protocols based on experience

# Weekly Pressure Plan Template

|Day|Morning Priority|Afternoon Focus|Evening Protocol|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|High-cognitive task|Routine/admin|Early wind-down|
|2|Complex problem-solving|Communication|Stress reset|
|3|Mid-week assessment|Collaborative work|Recovery focus|
|4|Flexibility checkpoint|Catch-up tasks|Gentle movement|
|5|Final push tasks|Wrap-up/cleanup|Decompression|
|6|Recovery planning|Light cognitive load|Social/creative|
|7|Complete rest|Preparation for next week|Reflection|

# Emergency Protocols

**When Flexibility Completely Breaks Down**

1. **Immediate**: Stop, breathe, hydrate
2. **5 minutes**: Change environment, gentle movement
3. **15 minutes**: Implement breathing protocol and rest
4. **30 minutes**: Consider strategic nap or complete task change
5. **1 hour**: Evaluate if continued work is counterproductive

**Crisis Communication Template**  
""I'm operating under high cognitive load and need \[specific time/support\] to maintain quality. I can deliver \[specific reduced scope\] today or \[full scope\] by \[realistic deadline\].""

# Integration with Daily Life

Cognitive flexibility under pressure isn't just a work skill‚Äîit's a life competency that affects relationships, parenting, health decisions, and personal growth. The strategies in this guide scale from managing a difficult conversation when you're exhausted to navigating major life transitions during stressful periods.

**Relationship Applications**  
Use the breathing reset protocol before difficult conversations when you're stressed. Apply the ""good enough"" decision rule to reduce perfectionism in household management. Implement the red flag system to prevent saying things you'll regret when emotionally dysregulated.

**Parenting Under Pressure**  
The flexibility checkpoints help you pivot when parenting strategies aren't working due to stress or sleep deprivation. Time boxing prevents getting stuck in power struggles. The strategic retreat recognition helps you take breaks before losing patience.

**Health and Wellness Integration**  
Apply task triage to separate urgent health needs from routine optimization. Use the supplement protocols to support stress resilience during challenging periods. Implement sleep recovery strategies after periods of necessary sleep restriction.

The goal isn't perfection‚Äîit's maintaining enough cognitive flexibility to navigate life's challenges without creating additional problems through rigidity, poor decisions, or complete breakdown. With practice, these tools become automatic responses that protect your mental agility when you need it most.

Building cognitive resilience is like physical fitness‚Äîconsistent, small practices create the capacity to handle larger challenges when they inevitably arise. Start with the interventions that feel most manageable, and gradually expand your toolkit as these approaches become second nature.",1,1761122459.0,cognitivesupport,1,1.0,False

Mofos. Sadly I can't stream tonight. Reasons are classified. But I'm going to attempt to do a Lucky Thursday instead! (We'll see if I can pull it off)

I was very much looking forward to playing more of inscription though. I can't wait to live stream again!

Welp, we did it Mofos. 30k. Pretty awesome. Sorry I have not been live streaming, I have good reasons. But I'll be honest (read on for honesty):

I have MAJOR plans for this channel and for my future creative endeavors. This year is going to be a vital and pivotal point for Luck is Me.

I will start live streaming again consistently starting next week. I've written the next cartoon and will start working on that as well. Also I have some guests planned for joining the livestreams.

We're on the quest for 50k and turning Luck is Me/future projects into my full time job. Let's do it!!

See you guys at the next Lucky Monday! Thank you all for the support!

Sorry I have not been streaming. Working hard on the christmas special. I know I say this a lot, but it's becoming my new favorite video. I'm stressing to have it out before christmas, and then I'll get back to streaming again + having special guests appear for the streams as well!

Anyway, You'll see a new video soon! (PS, thank you to everyone who bought shirts, that means so much to me!)

1od2s5s,https://v.redd.it/qlqdl4wkkmwf1,Why your coffee tastes inconsistent (even with the same recipe),"Over the past few months, I kept asking myself the same question:
**Why do my brews taste so inconsistent?**

Same recipe, same grind size, same water, same gear... yet somehow, one day it‚Äôs **over-extracted**, the next it‚Äôs **watery** or **bitter**.

I spiraled for a while.
Every time a YouTuber shared a new recipe, I‚Äôd try it.
Sometimes it worked, but most of the time it didn‚Äôt.

I tweaked ratios, grind size, and temperature.
Still, nothing felt enjoyable or repeatable.

Then I watched this [ARAMSE video about flow control](https://youtu.be/nxmrSgwW25g), and something finally clicked:
It wasn‚Äôt the recipe. **It was me**.

More specifically, my inconsistent pouring.
Sometimes I poured too fast, sometimes too slow, sometimes with pauses or broken streams.
And that inconsistency had a much bigger impact than I realized.

So I got a scale that shows real-time flow rate (ml/s), and started training myself to pour more consistently.

***The result??*** Cups that are more **replicable**, **more balanced**, and simply **more enjoyable**.

Now I remind myself:
Before you change the recipe, ask yourself this : is your flow rate consistent?
If yes, then maybe the recipe just doesn‚Äôt suit your beans.

Once you‚Äôve nailed consistent pouring, **then** it makes sense to experiment with grind, temperature, and other variables.
But I really want to emphasize this, **only after your pouring is stable and consistent** should you start tweaking the recipe.
If it‚Äôs not consistent yet, focus on that first.
In my experience, it makes a **huge difference**.

From what I‚Äôve noticed (feel free to correct me):

**Slower pour** ‚Üí increases the bean‚Äôs intensity

**Faster pour** ‚Üí gives a lighter, tea-like cup due to faster drawdown


Our job is just to find that **sweet spot** between the two.

Hope this helps someone who‚Äôs been chasing recipes like I was.
Maybe the real fix isn‚Äôt another new recipe, it‚Äôs just a **steadier pour**.

Then I found it, buried in the back. His old typewriter. A hulking gray thing, dust so thick it felt like fur. I went to lift it and a single, half-typed page stared back at me.

My heart jumped. For my whole life, I thought he was writing a secret novel down here. Some epic he didn't want us to see. I pulled the page out, hands shaking.

It wasn't a novel.

October 12th. Rain this morning. Sounded like tiny fists on the roof. The pavement on Elm Street looked like it had been crying. Drank my coffee. Black. Two sugars. Felt tired.

That was it. Just a description of a Sunday. A completely ordinary morning, probably five years ago.

I sat on the floor of that closet and cried. Not because it was sad, but because I finally got it. He wasn't trying to be a writer. He was just trying to hold onto his own life. To prove to himself that his mornings mattered.

I keep that page in my wallet now. When life feels like it's moving too fast, I read it. It's my reminder that a life isn't made in the big moments, but in the quiet ones you bother to write down.",2,1761122108.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False
