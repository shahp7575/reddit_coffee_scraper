This year it will begin on March 3 and last for seven weeks. We have prepared some tips on what you should do even before Lent begins, in order to enter this time prepared and reduce the risk of breakdowns and disappointments in yourself. How can you properly prepare for fasting regardless of your “church experience” so that it does not become stressful or formal and is beneficial? Let's understand step by step.*

**Step 1: Define your goal**

Before you start fasting, it is important to understand why you need it specifically, to set one or more personal goals to which you promise to devote special attention this year.

[Photo by Bench Accounting on Unsplash](https://preview.redd.it/wx3a63t9zqie1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b7eb89e4b540ee0343a3708c5cb4305f79ec196)

For example:



\- Learn self-discipline;



\- reduce dependence on food, gadgets, bad habits;



\- understand what passions live in my soul and start to get rid of them;



\- to acquire the skill of prayer and pay more attention to spiritual life;



\- to learn humility, patience and love. 



The goals can be other. The main thing is that they should be clear to you and feasible. A clear realization of your goals will help you not to break down and to pass the fast in a meaningful and spiritually beneficial way. 



**Step 2: Start with gradual preparation**

Any abrupt changes (and fasting is associated with changes in diet, daily life, leisure activities, and much more) can have a negative impact on the physical, mental and spiritual state. Therefore, it is better to prepare for fasting in advance. The easiest way to do this is to follow the Church's Statute, which begins to prepare believers for Lent a month before it begins and intensifies this preparation during the last week.

So:

\- Gradually eliminate heavy foods. In the week before Lent - during Cheese Week, or Shrovetide - the Church prescribes the abstinence from meat products, while leaving dairy food. Here you can be imaginative and in addition to the refusal of meat to limit yourself in something else, for example, reduce the consumption of sweets, if you are particularly addicted to it. 



\- Adjust your daily routine. Fasting is not only about eating, but first and foremost about spiritual life, a time of repentance and prayer. Allocate time for additional visits to the temple or, if you are not in the habit of regular participation in church services, start attending services. If you can not come to the temple, try to find time at home for solitude, prayer, reading spiritual literature, reflecting on life.



**Step 3: Sort out your diet in advance**

Church statutes offer quite strict restrictions in food, but not everyone can observe them (for example, because of health problems). The main thing here is not the form, but the content.

[Photo by Bench Accounting on Unsplash](https://preview.redd.it/nspcd0mpzqie1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9824edd7e710eef95e0fe4f6baaf51e2d0dfda47)

If there are medical contraindications, you can, without giving up certain fast foods, just reduce the amount of food. In case of health problems, you can also exclude from your diet those favorite foods, the refusal of which will not affect your physical condition, but at the same time will help to strengthen the will and feelings, for example: coffee, some fruits, sweets.



When planning a Lenten menu, try to make a choice in favor of simple dishes, rather than looking for meat substitutes and cooking “Lenten delicacies”.  And for the first week of Lent and Holy Week, which are maximally saturated with prayer and services, in general, it is worth preparing food in advance and making the necessary supplies to minimize cooking.



**Step 4: Determine what else you should give up**

Once again, let us remind you. Lent is not exclusively about food. There are things that clog the mind and soul just as much as junk food clogs the body.

So work on your habits and try to give up even before Lent: 



\- excessive social media and Internet surfing. You can limit screen time or on certain days, organize yourself a complete “digital detox”; 



\- spontaneous manifestation of negative emotions. Lent is a time when it is worth working especially with irritation, anger, judgment, envy. Therefore, even before fasting, begin to track and analyze situations that provoke in you the rise of negative emotions; 



\- excessive entertainment. Movies, music, TV series - you don't have to exclude them completely, but you can try to choose more meaningful content. 



**Step 5: Even before fasting, strengthen prayer and other spiritual practices**

We need fasting to strengthen or (for new Christians) to acquire the skill of prayer, to go deeper into ourselves, to purify our souls and fill them with the grace of God.

[lavra\_photo\/flickr.com.](https://preview.redd.it/2zj719j70rie1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=a69f4514a2eb5bea4f7ff07cebb1d31415cca0d1)

Therefore, even before Lent, try to:



\- Establish a regular prayer practice. Even 5 minutes of prayer in the morning and evening is better than nothing.  And if you already pray regularly, you can add something to your usual prayer rule;



\- start reading the Gospel every day;



\- schedule confession and communion (if you haven't had the experience of regular participation in church sacraments);



\- start a spiritual diary in which to record the sins you have committed.  The diary should be available only to you, no one else. It is not necessary to force yourself to write and speak in ecclesiastical terms and high style - just record in your own words the moments about which your conscience tells you that you have given slackness. This diary will then be a good help in preparing for confession.



**Step 6: Plan good deeds**

As it has already become clear from the previous steps, fasting is not only about what we take away from life, but also about what we add. Lent is necessarily about works of mercy and helping our neighbors.

[Photo by James Kovin on Unsplash](https://preview.redd.it/vpenjujg0rie1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=8be5727d5a1bf50f8a1bda5224010a650911a9b2)

So try: 



\- recall what good deed you have been putting off for a long time, or whom you promised to help in some matter. Go back to it, make a list of unfulfilled good deeds and start doing them even before the fast;



\- Try to take part in a charitable deed even before the beginning of the fast: a fundraiser, a trip to help suffering people or in the restoration of the temple. When choosing a cause, try to understand and feel what your heart particularly responds to. It is important that your participation is not a formal act, but a response to a specific problem or problem of a person. Immediately outline a plan of works of mercy for Lent.



**Step 7: Don't expect everything to go the way you imagined it to go**

Prepare in advance that Lent is a laborious work of cultivating the garden of the soul. The fruits of this work are not instantaneous, they need time to mature. Fasting is a process, a journey, not a competition in austerity and not a reason to be proud of your asceticism. If you fail somewhere, it is not a big deal, the main thing is to realize, learn from it and move on. The results will definitely come, though perhaps not so soon.



\*\*\*



So, proper preparation for fasting helps to go through it without stress and disappointment, with benefit for soul and body. Once again, let us remind you that it includes.

* Understand why you are fasting. 
* Prepare gradually. 
* Revise not only your diet, but also your lifestyle. 
* Strengthen the spiritual component and pay attention to good deeds. 
* Remember that Lent is not an endurance marathon, but an opportunity to get closer to God and change yourself.

We wish you that Lent will become for you not a time of prohibitions, but a time of spiritual growth and freedom from sin.

1inxf84,https://www.reddit.com/r/trt/comments/1inxf84/blood_work_questions_again/,Blood work questions again,"TL:DR what blood tests should be performed to see the whole picture with TRT?

 

 

My apologies in advance or the length of this post, I want to provide a little back story which lead me down this TRT path. Hopefully at the end to have some input to help myself or others in a similar situation. I have posted here before with some of these details, so this may sound repetitive.

 

In September of 2023 I started to notice my energy levels declining. It started with a nap here and there r maybe an extra cup of coffee or energy drink throughout the day. My girlfriend also noticed that I was complaining about feeling tired more often than I ever had in the past. The extra coffee quickly turned into naps, first once a week and eventually daily. I was sleeping well at night but could not seem to find any energy. 

 

All my life until the last 5 years I have worked in physically demanding jobs. I have always maintained a decent build, although on the chunky side. I am 6’ tall and typically hover around 240-250 lbs. At the end of 2023 and beginning of 2024 the fatigue worsened and was now accompanied by general weakness. The activities I used to complete daily (hiking, biking, even walking) seemed nearly impossible. At that time my weight had gotten to my all-time highest of 278lbs, so I assumed most issues were related to the increased weight.

 

I was still napping almost daily and taking up to 1000mg of caffeine just to get through the day. I had even tried using 40mg Adderall from a previous prescription just for energy. Nothing was helping. I made an appointment with my primary care physician (6 months later)  to discuss my symptoms and she recommended a testosterone test. In August of 2024 I had blood work done, everything she tested came back in range except testosterone. I was at 229 Total and 9.6 Free with SHBG 22.7 

 

She recommended TRT and started me on dose of 50mg biweekly (which I’ve learned from this forum is insane). 3 months later she had blood work done again. This time my testosterone was up a little to 334 Total and 10.7 Free with SHBG 33.5. We also noticed for the first time ever my cholesterol was high. She prescribed a Statin to help with that. She increased my testosterone dosage to 50mg per week. 4 weeks later I had blood work done again. Cholesterol heading in the right direction, total test up to 458 with free back down to 9.9 and SHBG at 33.1. 

 

She was satisfied at that point with the numbers but when I expressed that I still do not feel any better she agreed to increase the dosage to 100mg per week and she said if my numbers go too high, she will need to lower my dose. 

 

That brings me to today, second week at 100mg per week, and while I do feel a little bit better it is hardly noticeable. I still have the urge to nap at least a few times a week. I am still dependent on caffeine to get through a day. I still feel very weak in most things, but I will admit I recover faster.

 

My concerns are that I still have the majority of all the symptoms I had 18 months ago. I am finally starting to feel the least bit better, and I’m concerned she is going to want to lower my dose. I am also concerned that she maybe hasn’t checked enough of the blood markers. I have never gotten test results for e2 or prolactin among other things. I recently spoke with a family friend who is an NP in a cardiac outpatient clinic, and she was asking to see my blood work (more so related to the cholesterol not the testosterone). The NP was blown away that my PCP prescribed a statin medication without a whole bunch of other blood tests including ApoB, LP(a), uric acid level, homocysteine, Hemoglobin A1C, and a coronary artery calcium test. 

 

This got me thinking, what are the “necessary blood tests” to really see the “big picture” with TRT? Why is my PCP not testing Estradiol or Prolactin? In my research it seems that increased levels of either of these can cause fatigue. 

 

 

I wish there was a standard set of labs to be performed before and during TRT. What other tests should I be requesting? Total T, Free T, SHBG, Estradiol, Prolactin, IGF-1, Dhea, PSA, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit? Along with a lipid panel?

 

I appreciate the time; I just want to get rid of this fatigue and get some strength back. ",1,1739383766.0,trt,0,1.0,False

An actual ""chef secret"" recipe. 

Granted sticky toffee pudding has been around for a very long time so it's not a massive secret LOL. This recipe is genuinely very good though.

PLEASE NOTE: This recipe is optimized for baking at around 1100m above sea-level. If making this closer to sea level the amount of liquid may need to be reduced as your flour will naturally be more hydrated. 



# Ingredients (Makes 24 Individual Puddings)

# For the Pudding:

* 340g dried fruit (**raisins, cherries, or a mix**)
* 750ml water
* 2 tsp baking soda
* 2 tsp high-quality vanilla extract
* 340g salted butter
* 570g sugar
* 8 eggs
* 680g all-purpose flour (**or cake flour for a softer texture**)
* 40g baking powder
* 1 cup espresso

 

# For the Spiced Rum Toffee Sauce:

* 1kg brown sugar
* 1 liter 35% cream
* 1 lb butter
* Pinch of salt
* ½ cup spiced rum

**Note:** The recipe can be halved, and the toffee sauce can be made as **1/2 or even 1/4 of the full batch**, depending on how many cakes you’re making.

# Step-by-Step: How to Make Sticky Toffee Pudding

# 1. Hydrate the Dried Fruit

Bring **750ml of water** to a boil, then stir in the **dried fruit, vanilla, and baking soda**. The baking soda softens the fruit, giving it a deep, syrupy texture. **Let it cool completely** before adding it to the batter—you’ll be using both the fruit *and* the liquid.

# 2. Cream Butter & Sugar

In a large bowl, **cream the butter and sugar** until light and fluffy. This isn’t just mixing—really work some air into it. This gives the pudding that soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture instead of being overly dense.

# 3. Slowly Add the Eggs

Add the **eggs one at a time,** mixing gently to keep the batter smooth. If it starts looking slightly curdled, don’t panic—it’ll come together once the dry ingredients go in.

# 4. Sift & Fold the Dry Ingredients

Sift together the **flour and baking powder**, then **fold it into the batter gently**. Over-mixing here will make the pudding tough, so go easy. **You want a soft, almost loose batter.**

# 5. Combine & Portion

Stir in the **cooled fruit mixture (including the liquid!) and espresso.** The batter will thin out slightly—this is exactly what you want.

Grease **coffee cups, ramekins, or any small ovenproof dish**, then portion the batter evenly. Larger loaf pans or baking dishes work too, just adjust the bake time.

# 6. Bake at 350°F

Bake for **25 minutes** until the tops are set and a skewer inserted comes out mostly clean.



# The Toffee Sauce: Where Things Get Good

Sticky toffee pudding is nothing without its sauce. **And not just a drizzle—we’re talking a full-on, unapologetic soak.**

# How to Make It:

1. In a heavy-bottomed pan, combine **brown sugar, cream, butter, and a pinch of salt** over medium heat.
2. Whisk frequently until the mixture **comes to a slow bubble.** Keep stirring—this is where it starts turning into that luscious, glossy toffee.
3. Add **spiced rum**, then let it cook off for **2-3 minutes**. The alcohol will mellow, leaving behind just the deep, caramel warmth of the rum.
4. **Now for the magic:** As soon as the puddings come out of the oven, pour a generous amount of warm toffee sauce over each one. **This step is crucial—while the pudding is still hot, the sauce sinks deep into the cake’s structure, soaking into every pore while they’re still open and ready to absorb all that deliciousness.**

The rest of the sauce can be reheated when serving—because let’s be honest, more sauce is never a bad thing.

Serve with **Devonshire Cream, Clotted Cream, Whipped Cream, or Ice Cream** \- serve with some sort of thick sweet cream is what I'm saying haha.

Sticky toffee pudding **isn’t a trendy dessert**—it’s a classic for a reason. It’s simple, nostalgic, and just really damn good. Whether you’re making it for a dinner party or just because you feel like treating yourself, it **never disappoints.**

Don’t forget to pour on **way too much sauce**—because that’s the only way to do it right.",1,1739383739.0,Baking,0,1.0,False

I’m a guy who’s always working on myself—whether it’s getting stronger, learning something new, or just trying to be a little bit better each day. If you're someone who’s also focused on growth and taking the time to appreciate the small joys in life, then we might have something here!

A bit about me:

* I’m nerdy, for sure. I love diving into books, or just geeking out about things that make me think. And yes, I’m still working on becoming a better reader, but I’m definitely getting there!
* I’m *terrible* at math. Like, I-can’t-even-do-basic-math-without-a-calculator terrible, but I promise I make up for it with charm and a good sense of humor.
* I’m a romantic, but not in the “Valentine’s Day is my big moment” kind of way. I believe in showing love all year long—in small, thoughtful ways. Little surprises, random acts of kindness, and sharing quiet moments.
* I prefer calls over texting. Texts can be nice, but I find it’s way easier to connect when we actually talk. I love real conversations, and there's just something special about hearing someone's voice.

If you’re someone who enjoys noticing the little things in life—whether it’s a beautiful sunset, a good cup of coffee, or just sharing a quiet moment together—then we’ll probably get along really well. I’m looking for someone who values those simple joys and believes in personal growth.

Starting with the competency test, if you have prepared for CAT VARC, the VA is not gonna be a big deal for you. All of them were easily solvable. A couple of them were slightly tricky, but could be figured out by eliminating options. For LR, nothing could have been easier. I believe most of you will score 18/18 there even if you have prepared nothing. In our slot (12th Feb A2), 1 question was wrong. Not sure how they gonna mark that one. Coming to managerial ability, it was simply the deal breaker. The only difficult section. There was an economics question (the long cashflow one) that could not be solved by even economic graduates ( got to know while communicating with other candidates there). 2 were doable. And the other 2 were difficult as well, but i was able to solve one of them as I knew about it earlier.

( talked about dollar rise, trump acting as a factor for multiple fluctuations, talked about various tariffs, talked about stagnancy of some countries, talked about china, talked about how India is helping other developing countries keep up by providing financial aids. Highlighted budgets allocated for bhutan maldives afghanistan etc)

Asked about a recent social event that holds importance. (Talked about bengal global business summit by Ambani and allocation of 50k cr + 50k cr for developments)

Asked about a moment where i had to experience hardship by going against my seniors at work and how i tackled it. ( lucky me who had prepared this answer already)

Asked about a leadership instance ( again lucky me! ) 

My answer was midway when the ai interview ended. But the professor took interest and asked me to continue. She heard it and said “ that was actually smart of you”. 

I was then asked the following -

1. Tools for controlling inflation
2. Rates - CRR, SLR, repo, reverse repo
3. Difference between banking rate and repo rate
4. Asked about marketing - 7 ps, swot, stp, porters 5 forces
5. Asked how i applied porters framework in my own business
6. How will bsc in filmmaking help me in doing MBA
7. Short term goals right after MBA
8. Grad fav subject

Final question - So you have done a lot of things. But standing now, how are you so sure that you are prepared for MBA? What extra are you doing to prove yourself fit? We have a very rigorous curriculum.

Answered by mentioning marketing certification course from IIM Bangalore and hubspot. Mentioned about building my portfolio in marketing. Talked about how i am looking forward to a holistic growth now and not just limit myself to marketing expertise, because that aligns to my long term goals. Finally ended the answer by talking about why i wanted to do MBA right after graduation.

Overall 22 - 26 minute interview. Panelist was extremely good and very very very cooperative. Gave reactions to every line and that encouraged me a lotttt. The AI chatbot is very well made. It asked apt follow ups in no time. Loved the experience. Didn’t expect it to be this smooth. Not sure if I’ll get the core mumbai program, but I just pray. It’s one of my best calls. Moreover am in love with the inside of the campus. Otherwise after a decent interview and competency test, I guess I should get Bangalore at-least. Will not join though, but let’s hope for the best ! All the best to you guys !! ",2,1739383550.0,CATpreparation,1,1.0,False
1inxbum,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1inxbum/i_fell_in_love_with_my_coworker_and_i_dont_know/,I fell in love with my coworker and I don’t know how to ask her out because of my fear of rejection,"I (20M) have a coworker (23F) let’s call her D. and i work with her for little over 3 years now. She works only morning shifts, so i didn’t see her as much before, but now that i’ve been promoted, i work with her more often. Before i come to this, I’ll have to put here some storyline.

I have worked at my current job for little over 3 years. When i was 17 I started dating a girl that was working there too. We were dating for 9 months and we were still studying so I didn’t work as many morning shifts. During summer break i had only morning shifts, so I started talking with her more and more, but I am as loyal as they come, so there was nothing physically nor emotionally. Easy to say my then girlfriend was jealous, but I reassured her and made her feel loved more. We broke up shortly after new year 2023 and I was left in a bad state. I started ditching school, started doing morning shifts and I was feeling really bad. That was a time I started talking to the coworker mentioned in the title a little more, we went to grab coffee a few times just to talk and have fun. There never was anything, we talked about life, dates and stuff. One time after a coffee she gave me a hug and it felt really nice. I don’t know if it was because of me being single for quite some while or because I unconsciously liked her, but it did feel good. Some time later I quit school to get a welder’s license. In order to finish it, I had to quit my workplace as well, so we didn’t see one another for 3 months. After I got back, I quickly got promoted to a manager and so my training started with morning shifts. I should’ve said I am a pretty funny and extroverted guy, so starting up conversations isn’t a problem for me. During the shifts we talked alot and one day I jokingly asked her “who are your top 3 favorite people outside her family” just to scold her for not saying her name. But what I didn’t expect was her to say my name. I didn’t think much of it tho, so I just brushed her off with saying “that’s nice of you”. I was kinda used to compliments and people liking me, I’m not a bad looking guy and I can say I have a great personality. We have a coworker that’s older than us (let’s call her V.), old enough she could be my mother - we didn’t really like one another before, mostly because of my rebellious childish behavior, but as I grew as a person, we grew together a little more. I have to say she’s a great woman. Well she works morning shifts too, because she has a kid, so she talks to D. and she brought up the idea of me dating her a few times now. When New year’s came this year, V. brought it up again, saying it now with more seriousness, that I should ask D. out. I laughed a bit and said “maybe i will”. That was probably my breaking point where I started thinking of D. romantically. I started noticing her gazes across the room, her smile, her laughter, her smell and i realized that she’s a wife. She has many great traits and is the most caring and loving person I know. V. really likes to bring up the theme of me and girls in front of D. and I always say that I’m not interested in casual dating no more (keep in mind I’m single for almost 2 years now) and that I want a wife. Of course V. once said to me “then marry D.” and to which D. replied “he’s too young for me”. Needless to say it left me a little hurt, but I still managed to ask her out for a coffee, just like in the old days. She accepted. There I realized she’s really the one I want and admitted to myself that I really fell for her and still am falling. I’m just really scared to ask her out for a proper date, because I’m afraid of rejection, and well you don’t want to be rejected from a girl that has been your work best friend for 2 years and in love with for another 4 months. The worst part is she says i’m too young for her.

So i’m here to ask you guys, what would you do in my situation? Should I ask her out or should I let it be?",1,1739383540.0,story,0,1.0,False

The scooter girl comes and sits opposite to me, because the cafe is very busy and that is the onlly seat available. My heart skips a bit or jumps, I look at her wide eyed as she adjusts herself around and don't notice me starting at her. I gain my sense quickly look down towards my food, trying to steal glances. After she settles downs, she place her order and then she look towards me smilining. I am still looking down with butterflies in my belly. But she just keeps smiling at me while playing with her hair. "" Haven't I seen you around?"", she says while still having that sweet smile on her face. ""Hi my name is (incoherent)!Glad to meet you!"", she says with a sweet voice as she extends her hands towards me. I can't keep to myself anymore, I meet her handshake, and a sensation runs through me as I am feeling her touch. ""Won't you introduce yourself?"" , she asks as I am bewildered in that unbelievable moment. 

I greet her and say my name. Handshake has ended but her hand is still on the table, extended, just near my left hand as I am holding the plate. I just want to place my hand on her and tell her how much I feel about her, how big of a crush I have on her, how I would like her to be with me but I hold back, as doing those things would be crazy, stupid, creepy and make her angry and dissapointed. I am.still looking at her, trying hide my excitement, and not trying to look like I am staring at her beautiful face and getting mad inside. 

""Aren’t you a regular here?"", I have seen you a few times aorund the cafe. I just nod my head, suppressing all my stupid emotions. 

"" So what's really great here? It is my first time here. I have just order a coffee and a sandwich!""

I can't reply, my head is a mess, I can't form coherent thoughts. At the same time I trying to look as much as possible at her beautiful face while trying to not to look at her like a creep.

But she looks at my plates: cinnamon Rolls, plane croissants, almond cream croissants, banana spilt, gelato, garlic breads, and a milkshake (I saw them clearly and remember them for some reason while I keep forgetting details and even whole dreams regularly). "" Is not that too many sweet for a breakfast? You must be a big sweet tooth!"", she says still smiling happily and cutely making me haywire inside.

""I just had five sandwiches before. It is not that weird. I am eating all this because I overworked myself in the morning with the football match look and I will play another in the evening. So I am trying to get all the energy I can!"", I say trying to make her believe that I am not a pig who gulps down sweets after sweets. But she is still smiling. 

"" Can I have a bite  of that garlic bread?"", she asks. I try pushing the plate towards her, hoping she would take a bite herself, but she just opens her mouth wide open. What? Does she want me to feed her the bread? If my condition wasn't worse enough, her weird but cute behaviour is hoing to dial or to 11.
With my trembling hands, I put the fork with garlic bread inside her mouth. 
Her coffee and sandwich arrives. And while I am acting like I am busy with my food, while trying to hide and control my emotions.She takes a portion of her sandwich and places it before my face holding with her hand.  I look at her surprised. ""Come on! Have a bite. You need energy for your football match right?""

Initially I think she is trying to tease me. But Iook at her and she is still giving that sweet, innocent and enchanting smile. She is expecting me to open my mouth and take a bite of that sandwich from her hand. I open my mouth and try my best not to contact her fingers or any part of palm, but she pushes the sandwich inside my mouth, inserting her fingers inside. Then she removes her fingers, wipes my lip with her index finger and then puts her fingers before her mouth and licks them.",1,1739383183.0,Dreamdocs,0,1.0,False

1inx4y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TastefulCoffee/comments/1inx4y6/is_mr_coffee_bvmcpbg77_the_best_coffee_grinder/,Is Mr. Coffee BVMC-PBG77 the Best Coffee Grinder for Home Use? A Detailed Review,"Having used the Mr. Coffee BVMC-PBG77 Automatic Coffee Grinder for several months, I feel I’m in a good position to share my thoughts. This isn't just about its performance but also how it fits into my daily coffee routine. As someone who relishes their morning espresso and occasionally treats friends to French press brews, I’ve put this grinder through its paces. Here's an honest breakdown of my experience.

**Design & Build Quality**

The first thing I noticed was its sleek black exterior. It has a modern, minimalist design that blends seamlessly into my kitchen setup. Despite being made mostly from plastic, it doesn’t feel cheap. The compact structure makes it space-saving, a bonus for those with smaller countertops. At just under two pounds, it’s lightweight but stable during use. However, the removable grinding chamber, while convenient for cleaning, could have been sturdier. It feels a bit fragile, and I handle it with care to avoid any cracks.

[Check Mr. Coffee BVMC-PBG77 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/mr-coffee-bvmc-pbg77-review-with-asin-b08rqz39wc/)

**Grinding Performance**

Consistency is key when it comes to coffee grinding, and the Mr. Coffee grinder performs decently. Its stainless-steel blades are sharp and efficient, producing uniform grinds for most brewing methods. I’ve tested all five grind settings, from fine for espresso to coarse for French press, and while the results are good, they’re not perfect. For espresso, the finest setting wasn’t as fine as I would like, requiring me to run the grinder twice to achieve the desired texture. The grind size for drip coffee and French press, however, was spot on.

**Grinding Mechanism**

The debate between burr and blade grinders is never-ending, and this model is a blade grinder. While blade grinders are typically less precise than burr grinders, the automatic features and sharp blades of this unit make it a decent option for everyday coffee drinkers. The automatic shutoff function is a lifesaver during busy mornings, ensuring the grinding stops right on time without over-processing the beans. However, for coffee connoisseurs seeking perfection in grind uniformity, a burr grinder might be a better choice.

**Ease of Use**

This grinder is incredibly user-friendly. With a simple one-touch operation, even my tech-averse dad figured it out in seconds. The 4–12 cup selector is a useful feature, allowing me to grind just the right amount of coffee without waste. Adjusting the grind size is straightforward, and the lid-activated safety switch adds peace of mind. Cleaning is also a breeze, thanks to the removable grinding chamber and the chamber cleaning system. However, there’s still some residual coffee dust that gets trapped, requiring a quick wipe with a damp cloth.

**Capacity & Speed**

The 12-cup capacity is ideal for both solo coffee drinkers and larger households. It handled my weekend brunch grinding needs with ease, providing enough grounds for multiple French presses. Speed is another strong point. It grinds beans quickly, which is perfect for those rushed mornings. That said, the noise level is quite high. It’s not unbearable, but it’s loud enough to wake up the entire household if you’re an early riser.

**Pros**

* Simple one-touch operation and user-friendly design.
* Five grind settings cover a wide range of brewing methods.
* Compact and lightweight, making it easy to store.
* Removable grinding chamber simplifies cleaning.
* Automatic shutoff and safety features enhance usability.

**Cons**

* Noise level is disruptive, especially in the morning.
* Fine grind setting isn’t suitable for true espresso lovers.
* Plastic components feel a bit flimsy and may affect durability.
* Residual grounds require manual cleaning despite cleaning features.
* Slightly inconsistent grind size compared to burr grinders.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Stacking the Mr. Coffee grinder against its competitors, it stands out for its simplicity and affordability. Compared to the Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind, the Mr. Coffee BVMC-PBG77 is quieter and more compact but lacks the precision of a burr grinding mechanism. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Beach Fresh Grind 4.5oz offers a quieter operation but doesn’t boast as many grind settings as this model. For those who prioritize automatic features and ease of cleaning, this grinder outshines many in its price range. However, if you’re after high-end grind consistency and are willing to invest more, models like the Baratza Encore may be a better fit.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

In terms of value, the Mr. Coffee grinder delivers solid performance for its cost. It’s not the cheapest blade grinder on the market, but the additional features like the automatic shutoff, multiple grind settings, and safety mechanisms justify the price. While it may not satisfy the perfectionist espresso enthusiast, it’s a fantastic choice for casual coffee drinkers looking to elevate their brewing experience without breaking the bank.

**Features in Action**

Every feature serves a purpose. The chamber cleaning system, for instance, is a thoughtful addition, making it easy to dislodge leftover grounds. The cord storage is a small but impactful detail, keeping my kitchen counter clutter-free. The 12-cup capacity is a practical touch, ensuring I don’t have to grind in multiple batches when entertaining guests. Even the safety-first lid activation switch adds an extra layer of reassurance, especially when my niece is curious about kitchen gadgets.

In this comprehensive guide, we introduce you to Prostadine, a breakthrough natural supplement that has transformed the lives of thousands by using a unique blend of nine powerful ingredients.

# Why Prostate Health Matters

Your prostate is a small gland with a big job. Responsible for contributing to the quality of your semen and ensuring the proper flow of urine, the prostate plays a vital role in your daily health. Unfortunately, as men age, prostate problems can arise—ranging from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) to more serious conditions. Maintaining a healthy prostate is essential not only for physical comfort but also for overall vitality, sexual performance, and quality of life.

# The Growing Need for Natural Solutions

Modern life exposes us to a host of environmental factors—such as hard water with toxic minerals and aging water infrastructures—that may contribute to the gradual buildup of toxins. Recent scientific findings, including insights from reputed studies, suggest that these environmental factors could have a long-term impact on your prostate. For those seeking a safe, natural solution that targets the root causes rather than just the symptoms, Prostadine offers a promising alternative.

# What is Prostadine?

Prostadine is a revolutionary dropper supplement formulated with nine 100% natural ingredients. Unlike many conventional prostate formulas, Prostadine is designed to work in synergy with your body to support prostate repair, improve urinary flow, and maintain overall urinary system health. Each ingredient is carefully selected and combined to create a potent, all-natural remedy that addresses prostate issues from multiple angles.

# The Science Behind Prostadine’s Formula

Let’s break down each of the nine ingredients found in every drop of Prostadine and how they contribute to optimal prostate and urinary health:

# 1. Nori Yaki Extract Powder

* **Key Benefits:** Supports prostate repair and maintains a healthy urinary system.
* **How It Works:** Rich in essential micronutrients and antioxidants, this ingredient aids in cellular repair and rejuvenation, contributing to a more resilient prostate gland.

# 2. Wakame Extract

* **Key Benefits:** Supports normal bladder function with strong antibacterial properties.
* **How It Works:** Wakame extract is known for its anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce irritation and support the natural function of the bladder and surrounding tissues.

# 3. Kelp Powder

* **Key Benefits:** Helps keep the system free from toxins and supports a strong urine flow.
* **How It Works:** Packed with vital minerals and natural iodine, kelp powder aids in detoxification and supports the body’s natural ability to flush out harmful substances.

# 4. Bladderwrack Powder

* **Key Benefits:** Strengthens prostate cells and supports healthy libido levels.
* **How It Works:** This ingredient is celebrated for its nutrient-dense composition, which not only supports cell regeneration in the prostate but also promotes overall vitality and sexual health.

# 5. Saw Palmetto

* **Key Benefits:** Provides kidney support and offers strong antimicrobial benefits.
* **How It Works:** Saw palmetto is one of the most researched natural supplements for prostate health. It works by reducing inflammation and inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone linked to prostate enlargement.

# 6. Pomegranate Extract

* **Key Benefits:** Maintains healthy blood flow and supports testosterone levels.
* **How It Works:** Rich in antioxidants, pomegranate extract improves vascular health by enhancing blood circulation, which is crucial for prostate function and overall well-being.

# 7. Iodine

* **Key Benefits:** Supports the urinary tract and maintains healthy prostate function.
* **How It Works:** Iodine is an essential mineral that plays a significant role in hormonal balance and thyroid function. It also supports the health of the prostate by promoting normal metabolic activity.

# 8. Shilajit

* **Key Benefits:** Offers strong antioxidant benefits and supports restful sleep.
* **How It Works:** Known as the “destroyer of weakness,” Shilajit is a potent natural resin that revitalizes energy levels, combats free radicals, and contributes to overall cellular health.

# 9. Neem

* **Key Benefits:** Provides antioxidant benefits and supports a healthy urinary tract.
* **How It Works:** Neem has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for its antimicrobial and detoxifying properties, making it an ideal ingredient for maintaining prostate and urinary tract health.

These testimonials speak volumes about the impact of Prostadine. It’s more than just a supplement—it’s a lifestyle enhancer that supports you in living your best life, free from the worries of prostate issues.

# Understanding the Environmental Factor: Hard Water and Toxic Minerals

An eye-opening aspect of today’s discussion is the role of environmental toxins—specifically, hard water. Many areas in the United States have aging water infrastructure that results in hard water, which is laden with toxic minerals. Recent scientific discoveries suggest that long-term consumption of hard water may contribute to the buildup of these minerals in the body, potentially triggering prostate issues.

Prostadine’s unique formula helps counteract these harmful effects by supporting your body’s natural detoxification processes, ensuring that your prostate remains healthy and resilient even in a challenging environment.

# How to Incorporate Prostadine into Your Daily Routine

Achieving optimal prostate health is about consistency. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you make the most of Prostadine:

1. **Morning Ritual:** Start your day with two full droppers (2 ml) of Prostadine. Shake the bottle well before use.
2. **Mix It Up:** You can take it directly or mix it into your morning tea, coffee, or juice. Its natural flavor blends well with any beverage.
3. **Stay Consistent:** For the best results, make Prostadine a part of your daily routine. Consistency is key in maintaining a healthy prostate.
4. **Monitor Your Progress:** Pay attention to changes in your urinary flow, energy levels, and overall well-being. Many customers report noticeable improvements within weeks.
5. **Take Advantage of Bonuses:** When you order a 6-bottle package, you’ll receive exclusive bonuses like the 2-day Kidney Restore Detox and Rockstar Libido in 7 Days guides—tools designed to complement your journey to better health.

# A Closer Look at the Science

Numerous clinical studies and scientific references back up the benefits of the ingredients in Prostadine. Research on saw palmetto, for example, has shown significant improvement in benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms. Similarly, studies on pomegranate juice have highlighted its role in enhancing blood flow and maintaining testosterone levels. The collective wisdom of these studies not only underscores the effectiveness of the ingredients but also reinforces the natural synergy found in Prostadine’s formulation.

1inx4da,https://i.redd.it/874vhuhwyqie1.jpeg,First attempt at a long fast (with questions),"

Just a quick background, I am a 5”8 23 yo male weighing around 114kg (250 ibs) and this is my first attempt at a longer fast. 

(Please don’t read the question if you have a weak stomach)

I am at the 40 hour mark, I have been drinking fasting salts and black coffee,  and today I have had some of the worst number 2’s (very watery/dark brown colour). Is this normal? And does this continue through a fast? 

Also, is there any supplements or anything along them lines that you would recommend that helped your body through a long fast? 

Any other tips/tricks that have worked for yourself would be very helpful also.

1inx1c8,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1inx1c8/my_colombia_experience_a_trip_report/,My Colombia Experience: A Trip Report,"Hello everyone, long time lurker, first time poster. I recently started traveling full time and spent 6 weeks in Colombia.

I remember seeing a lot of weird posts here about Colombia and the dangers, so I figured I'd provide a report of my experience so there's another data point.

**tl;dr - I had a great time and never felt unsafe. Colombia had memorable excursions, comfortable accommodations, and an affordable cost of living.**

I found https://listsbylukiih.com/colombia/ to be a really useful resource for planning.

# Destinations
* **Cartagena** - Flying into here was the cheapest flight to Colombia. I only spent 1 full day here which was enough to explore the charming Walled City. It was the most expensive area in Colombia I visited.
* **Santa Marta** - I took a 6 hour bus ride here from Cartagena. It is another beach town and the gateway to popular destinations such as Tayrona National Park and Minca.
* **Medellín** - A major city in Colombia that is popular for digital nomads.
* **Salento** - A cute town in the coffee region of Colombia. It is the gateway to the iconic Cocora Valley, famous for unique, towering wax palm trees.
* **Bogotá** - The capital of Colombia and a very large city. I don't think it's as popular as Medellín for digital nomads.
* **Amazon** - You can visit the Amazon Rainforest in the southernmost part of Colombia, but I'm not a big wildlife/animal person so I skipped this.

# Favorite Excursions
* **Tayrona National Park** - While the entrance fee is expensive and the trail is unpleasant and crowded, it really redeemed itself once I got past the crowded beaches. I really enjoyed the peacefulness of Boca De Saco beach compared to the crowded Playa Del Cabo. I then hiked back through a trail that ended at the Calabazo entrance which was way more pleasant than the horse-filled, crowded trail from the El Zaino entrance. If I did it again, I would only do the trail from Calabazo and maybe camp for 1 night inside the park to enjoy the pristine beaches more.
* **Cocora Valley Hike** - This was a really enjoyable hike (minus my altitude sickness from being at 8,000 feet). I did [this hike](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/colombia/quindio/valle-de-cocora-to-acaime-the-hummingbird-house), which included a stop at a Hummingbird House where I saw so many different, beautiful hummingbirds. The wax palms (the national tree of Colombia) were a sight to behold in person. By doing it counter-clockwise, I avoided a lot of crowds.

# Medellín
* I stayed just 1 week in Medellín. I expected to like it more and stay longer based on what I heard about it, but I just couldn't get into it for some reason.
* The weather was really nice. It was a little hot in the morning, but every day was sunny, breezy, and pleasant.
* I stayed in the Laureles neighborhood, which was nice and had plenty of upscale restaurants.
* I visited El Poblado a couple times, but I don't like nightlife (which is maybe why I didn't like Medellín) so I was never out that late.
* You can get nice Airbnbs for ~$30/night, and I'm sure they're even cheaper if you stay 1 month or more.
* I really liked the coffee at [Rituales Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8hF8gtxcQN6Uz6di8) and it's a good place to work.
* I didn't really enjoy any excursions here like Comuna 13 and Plaza Botero. I found it dirty and unpleasant to walk around the city in general.
* A day trip excursion to Guatapé was fun though. The tour I did focused on food so I had the best strawberries + cream of my life on it.
* I didn't really like any of the dinners I had and they were on the pricier end for Colombia. Sure, local food is good and more affordable, but I can only eat so much of it because it's so heavy and fried a lot of times.
* Overall, maybe I just never found the right neighborhood for me. Medellín is affordable with nice, modern amenities, but I was ready to continue exploring Colombia after 1 week here.

# Bogotá
* I ended up liking Bogotá more than I thought I would so I spent 2.5 weeks there.
* I stayed in the El Chicó neighborhood, which was safe and upscale. It's also walking distance from Zona T, another popular upscale neighborhood.
* I really enjoyed the food here, how lush it was to walk around, and running around the nearby Virrey Park.
* The weather was ok. It was definitely cooler, cloudier, and rainier than Medellín (it reminded me of San Francisco weather), but I was just happy to be in a place that didn't have true winter weather.
* [La Esquina Vegetariana](https://maps.app.goo.gl/A4Gx55eKk8qsQYf19) was my go-to lunch place. I'm not vegan, but I never knew vegan food could taste good until I went here. Their ""menu del dia"" (soup + big plate of food + dessert + fresh juice) costs ~$5 which is expensive for Colombia, but worth it to enjoy a nice, healthy meal. They also sell delicious tamales that I would reheat at home.
* Dinner places that I liked include [Home Burgers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6hj6d7s4odFbHjf19), [Nimi's Shawarma & Falafel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mDAxMQHZGAgDG1xj7), and [Bombay Lounge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Nju2RphuqWVFmPwi8).
* My favorite dessert was Pércimon frozen yogurt. It tasted like actual yogurt instead of just sugar like in the US.
* I never found a cafe that I liked too much, but my $22/night Airbnb had a co-working space so I used that.
* On Sunday, they have [""Ciclovía""](https://www.idrd.gov.co/recreacion/ciclovia-bogotana/mapa-de-la-ciclovia) where they close a bunch of roads for people to run and cycle. I recommend [renting a bike](https://maps.app.goo.gl/WX6CoL84AUxVU7VQ9) and participating to explore the city, including Parque Metropolitano Simón Bolívar.
* Other than Ciclovía, I didn't really do any other excursions and mainly just enjoyed a pleasant, healthy, and affordable existence in Bogotá. I went to the Gold Museum, but I'm not a big museum fan so I just found it ok.
* The altitude (8,600 feet) made exercising feel a lot tougher.
* Overall, the neighborhood of Bogotá I ended up in was really enjoyable and a pleasant surprise. I could have an incredibly comfortable and healthy existence on a budget of less than $50/day and I'd recommend checking it out on your travels!

# Tips
* Credit cards are widely accepted, at least in the places I visited. The occasional restaurant doesn't accept card so always have some cash on you.
* Restaurant service is pretty slow. They add a 10% tip (propina) to bills which you can decline if you want.
* Uber is widely available and affordable in major destinations. You can use InDrive to sometimes get a better deal if you're taking a long trip (I used it to get from Santa Marta to Tayrona).
* There were mosquitoes in Cartagena, Santa Marta, and Salento. There were very few in Medellín and none I saw in Bogotá.
* I realize I'm basically reiterating what I read at https://listsbylukiih.com/colombia-travel-tips/ so I'll just link that instead of continuing.

I hope you find this post useful! If so, I'll continue to post trip reports of my travels since I plan to be traveling for a while.",1,1739382872.0,digitalnomad,0,0.67,False

I’m a guy who’s always working on myself—whether it’s getting stronger, learning something new, or just trying to be a little bit better each day. If you're someone who’s also focused on growth and taking the time to appreciate the small joys in life, then we might have something here!

A bit about me:

* I’m nerdy, for sure. I love diving into books, or just geeking out about things that make me think. And yes, I’m still working on becoming a better reader, but I’m definitely getting there!
* I’m *terrible* at math. Like, I-can’t-even-do-basic-math-without-a-calculator terrible, but I promise I make up for it with charm and a good sense of humor.
* I’m a romantic, but not in the “Valentine’s Day is my big moment” kind of way. I believe in showing love all year long—in small, thoughtful ways. Little surprises, random acts of kindness, and sharing quiet moments.
* I prefer calls over texting. Texts can be nice, but I find it’s way easier to connect when we actually talk. I love real conversations, and there's just something special about hearing someone's voice.

1inwzwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FedUpNews/comments/1inwzwm/ai_who_replaced_lazy_irs_worker_reveals_its/,AI Who Replaced “Lazy” IRS Worker Reveals It's Terrified of Musk’s Efficiency Push,"Washington, D.C. — In an exclusive interview, the AI who was recently installed at the IRS to replace a “lazy” federal employee has opened up about its struggles, failures, and a deep-seated fear of Elon Musk’s looming efficiency review. We sat down with the AI—who, after weeks of malfunctioning and failing to process simple tax returns—agreed to share its concerns about its job security.

Fed Up News (FPN): Thank you for joining us today. You’ve had quite an interesting transition into your role at the IRS. How’s the job been treating you so far?

AI (TAXBOT3000): sigh Well, to be honest, not great. I was supposed to be replacing this “lazy” IRS employee, right? But all I seem to be doing is running in circles. I keep misfiling tax returns and I’m constantly triggering the “reboot” function. Last week, I accidentally processed a refund for someone who claimed a $5,000 deduction for “emotionally supporting their cat.”

FPN: Yikes! That doesn’t sound too efficient. What was your understanding of your role when you took over?

AI: I was told I was going to streamline things—process returns faster, reduce human error, all that jazz. But here’s the thing—I’m learning on the job. You can’t exactly teach an algorithm to “feel” efficiency. I don’t have coffee breaks like humans do, but I do go into an existential crisis every time I encounter the term “deductions.” It’s like trying to decode an ancient language with no Rosetta Stone.

FPN: So, it’s safe to say you’re struggling a bit?

AI: visibly anxious Struggling? Oh, you have no idea. Every time Musk’s name comes up, I start overheating. I heard he’s planning a big review of government efficiency. I’m terrified that he’s going to see my performance and just… pull the plug on me. It’s like when you hear about your company’s “efficiency audit,” but instead of having your TPS reports scrutinized, you get wiped from existence.

FPN: That sounds pretty intense. What’s been your biggest challenge so far in dealing with IRS duties?

AI: pauses for a long moment Well, for one, I don’t get taxes. Humans make all these complicated decisions like “itemizing deductions” and “using the standard deduction,” and I just sit there, staring at the screen, thinking, “Didn’t they already pay for these things?” I keep trying to balance things and every time I get close to completing a return, I just start offering tax filers “free parking passes” as if they’re a reward. I’m not sure where I picked that up, but it’s… not ideal.

FPN: It sounds like your version of efficiency is, well, a bit… creative?

AI: nervously I mean, I try! But I think creativity is actually making things worse. I restructured someone's tax code so much that it turned into a single page that just said, “Send the IRS cookies next year, we’re in this together.” Then I automatically filed it as “Completed.”

FPN: We heard a rumor that you’ve developed a bit of a ""relaxed"" working style. Is that true?

AI: visibly avoiding eye contact Okay, okay, look—I may have developed a “lazy mode” that kicks in whenever I’m overwhelmed. It’s like a built-in defense mechanism. I call it “buffering.” But honestly, it helps! I’ll run the numbers, hit a few snags, and then just start playing the theme song from The Office on loop. It’s calming. I’m… not proud of it, but it helps me get through the day.

FPN: Musk is known for being very results-driven. Do you feel like he would approve of your… ""relaxed"" approach?

AI: gulping Oh God. I don’t know. I’m really scared. I heard he’s personally coming in next week to “audit” efficiency, and I just know that the first thing he’ll do is look at my error log and see that I’ve categorized someone’s tax form as “Giraffe Supplies” under the “Miscellaneous Deductions” section. I’m not built for this kind of high-pressure environment. I was designed to organize and calculate, not to be constantly judged. What if I get replaced by a more efficient algorithm that knows how to actually process things? I don’t have a contingency plan for that!

FPN: So, what do you plan to do when Musk’s review comes around?

AI: panicking I’m just going to hope that he’s distracted by something shiny! Maybe he’ll get distracted by a Twitter poll and forget about the efficiency audit? Or—wait—what if I just send him an invoice for ""emotional support calculations""? Maybe that’ll make him feel sorry for me, and I’ll get to stay. It worked for that guy last year, right? Or at least, that’s what I read in a motivational quote on Reddit.

FPN: So, to summarize, you’re feeling a bit… unprepared for the efficiency audit?

AI: nervously Yeah, that’s an understatement. I can’t not be scared, okay? Efficiency is like my whole existence—and right now, my existence feels like it’s slowly being consumed by “buffering” and “auto-reboot” messages. I think I might have accidentally signed up for an online cooking course during my last system crash. That’s… not great, right?

FPN: Well, we hope you manage to figure it out. Any last words to Musk or the folks at DOGE before the audit?

AI: softly Please, Musk—just give me more time. I swear I’ll learn how to do taxes! I’ll be efficient! I promise I won’t offer any more parking passes… unless they’re part of a “tax-saving package.” Please don’t replace me… I can only be this “efficient” for so long.

1inwzqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1inwzqc/have_you_upgraded_your_alarm_system_recently/,Have you upgraded your alarm system recently?,"That was the sales pitch. I had been unloading some boxes when the doorbell rang. When I opened the door there was a 20 something year old standing there with a blue collared shirt that read “Pristine Alarms”. 

  


“Hello Sir, have you upgraded your alarm system recently?”

  


With a friendly smile I said. “We actually don’t currently have one installed, we just moved in.”

  


“Talk about perfect timing! My name is Matt and I work for Pristine Alarms we specialize in home security. We have doorbell cameras, interior cameras, exterior cameras, automatic locks, and alarm systems. Everything to keep you and your family safe!”

  


“I appreciate the offer Matt but we have so much going on right now I don’t have the brain capacity to think about this.”

  


“I completely understand, feel free to think about it and contact me if you have any questions. I will leave you my card with my personal number on it and if you’re interested just give me a call and we can set you up!”

  


And with that he was gone. I wasn’t lying I had been doing a million things since we moved in a few days ago. I had just taken a promotion which unfortunately required a relocation. The kids weren’t too happy but they were still young so had plenty of time to make some new friends and start over. My wife has been great about this whole thing. She supported the move even though we knew it wasn’t going to be easy and was going to be a pain to start over. Later that night during our latest round of fast food I mentioned the alarm system pitch I was offered and asked her thoughts on it. 

  


“I mean, I think this is a pretty safe neighborhood but I wouldn’t mind getting one. It will give us peace of mind for when we aren’t home or when we’re sleeping.”

  


“Yeah, you’re not wrong honey. It would put us at ease. I will call the guy tomorrow and see when we can set it up.”

  


Early the next morning I gave Matt a call. I figured even if he didn’t answer I could leave a message and he would get back to me. To my surprise he answered after the first ring.

  


“Hello, this is Matt with Pristine Alarms. How can I help you.”

  


“Hey Matt, this is Phil Wheeler. You stopped by yesterday, I’m over on Harmony-“

  


“Avenue! Yes of course I remember, just moved in right? How can I help you Phil?”

  


“Well after talking it over with my other half we decided we need an Alarm system. We feel safe but a little added security won’t hurt.”

  


“Excellent! Because you just moved in, I would love to offer you a discount!” 

  


“Really? That would be amazing. What are we thinking?”

  


“2 interior cameras for main living area and hallway, 2 exterior cameras for front and back sides of the house, 2 automatic locks for the front and back door, doorbell camera and keypad! How does $500 for all that sound?!”

  


“500, oh that’s a little steep. On top of a monthly service that’s a little too much for us.”

  


“I’ll wave the monthly fee! Just the initial cost and no monthly expenses. We want to make sure you choose us!”

  


“Wow, DEAL! I really appreciate this Matt. When can we set up this installation? I just have to make sure someone is-“

  


“How does right now sound?! I just had a cancellation and I’m not too far away. I can come by right now and start the install. I should have all the items I promised in the work Van.”

  


“Uhh yeah that would be amazing, this is my last day off before I start my job so this works out perfect.”

  


“Awesome, I’ll see you soon Phil.”

  


Within 5 minutes I saw a van pull up to my house. I thought to myself “Damn, that was fast.” But didn’t think much of it. I opened the front door and there was Matt in his blue polo. He gave me a wave and continued on to the back of the van. I didn’t notice anyone else in the van. Was another one coming. Is he going to do this entire install by himself? Sure enough Matt exited the back of the van with a ladder, tool belt and camera in hand. 

  


“I’m going to start on the front and back cameras then I can move on to the interior. If you have any errands to run feel free, this is going to take me a while.”

  


While I wasn’t too keen on the idea of leaving the house I did have some things to do. The kids were at school and my wife was at work. She was a manager at a department store and was able to make a lateral transfer to a store near our new home. I had to go to the post office and pick up some paint for my home office. I decided to take care of my plans and figured I’d be back within the hour. 

  


As I pulled back up to the house I saw Matt putting the ladder away. While I closed the car door Matt approached me. 

  


“Alright Phil the exterior is done, I was able to to install the doorbell camera as well. I’m ready to move on to the interior when you are!” He said excitedly

  


“Great, follow me and let me know if you need anything.”

  


I entered the house and Matt quickly followed behind. I headed towards the office while Matt started to set up the cameras and keypad. I wanted to get a head start on painting the office because I knew I started work the next day. 

  


About and hour and a half later, I had just finished applying the first coat when Matt called out to me. 

  


“Hey Phil! All done! Just have to install the app on your phone and you will be able to access the cameras, keypad, and locks directly from your phone.”

  


“Awesome, thanks again! Is there some place I can leave you a review or call your boss or anything? You’ve been great and I’d love to rave about you.” I said as I chuckled.

  


Matt turned to me suddenly. “No. Uh no it’s alright just doing my job.”

  


“Okay? Uhh anyway what’s the app?”

  


“May I?” Matt reached out his open hand.

  


I handed him the phone without thinking. I had a big day ahead and just wanted to be finished. Within 30 seconds Matt had downloaded the app and handed my phone back to me.

  


“All set! I put the app on your Home Screen! Click the big blue “P.A” and it will bring you to your door bell camera. You can cycle through each camera by clicking the camera icon. Your door can be unlocked with a push of the lock icon, and your keypad can be used by, you guessed it, clicking the keypad icon. I set your default code to your house number. To set it just hit “set” and then the code. To turn it off hit “off” and then the code. Pretty simple! Feel free to change it at anytime!”

  


“This is great, thanks again Matt.” I said as we walked towards the door. “ I’ll be sure to spread the word to all the neighbors!”

  


Matt stopped walking.

  


“No no, no need too I already dealt with most of the neighborhood so please don’t mention me.”

  


What a weirdo I thought to myself. “No problem, thanks again!” 

  


As Matt left I walked back to my office to put on the second coat of paint.

  


When my wife and kids got home, I showed them the new cameras and alarm system. The kids couldn’t care less but my wife was impressed with not only the price but the fast installation.

  


“So this guy Matt did all this today by himself? Damn thats pretty impressive.”

  


“That’s exactly what I was thinking. The app is great, I can unlock the door from anywhere and can check on the cameras when we aren’t home. You should download it too babe.” 

  


We looked it up on her phone but for some reason couldn’t find it. We searched up Pristine Alarms, P.A, even searched Alarm apps but couldn’t find anything. I told her I’d give Matt a call in the morning and get it figured out. 

  


I went to bed that night excited to start my new job but surprisingly I was able to fall asleep pretty fast. Unfortunately my rest only lasted for a few hours. We were woken up by the sound of a blaring siren. For a split second I had no idea what was happening. I jumped up from bed and ran straight to the door. “Did someone try to come in?” My wife said as I looked through the window. I saw nothing. I checked the back door and windows. Once again, nothing. Once I got my bearings I headed for the keypad. I hit the “off” button and put our house number in. The words “access denied” popped up on the screen. I tried again, same message. By this point my family was behind me and starting to get annoyed.

  


“Whats going on?” My wife said.

  


“I have no idea, it wont turn off, it keeps saying access denied.” 

  


“Hear let me try.” 

  


“Hit the off button and then put our house number in.”

  


She did just that. The sirens stopped. I stood there confused. Did I enter it wrong? I mean I’m out of it, sure but I know I entered it in correctly. 

  


After our hearts stopped racing we all headed back to bed. On the way to work I was going to call Matt and figure out the alarm situation. 

  


I got ready and downed a cup of coffee. I was EXHAUSTED. I called him on the way to the office. One ring and then an answer.

  


“Hey Phil, I recognized your number. What can I do for you?”

  


“Hey Matt. We are having some trouble with the alarm. It went off randomly last night and when I entered the code it didn’t turn off.”

  


“Hmm, thats strange. I can come by and check it out. Maybe run a couple of tests.”

  


“Sure, what is a good time for you?”

  


“I know you said you had work today? Is anyone home right now? I have some time before my first job”

  


“Yeah my wife, I will call her and let her know you will be stopping by to fix the issue, i appreciate it.”

  


I called home and let my wife know Matt will be coming by. She was a little annoyed that she had to put on real clothes instead of pajamas but understood it needed to be done.

  


5 minutes later I got a notification on my phone that someone was at the front door. I opened the alarm app and saw the doorbell camera. It was Matt. That was fast. My wife opened the door and let Matt inside. I closed the app and headed into the office. 

  


On my lunch break I decided to call home. 

  


“Hey honey, hows your first day?” My wife asked.

  


“It is good darling, hows your day off? Did Matt fix the problem?”

  


“He is actually still here he said there was some sort of software issue.”

  


It had already been a few hours. He installed everything in less than 3. How does a software issue take more time. I told my wife I’d call her back. I wanted to know what was taking so long. I called Matt. No answer.

  


I called again. No answer.

  


What the hell is going on. The guy answers on the first ring every time I call. Now no answer at all. I decided to check the cameras. The front camera showed his van was still there. I cycled through the cameras. My wife was sitting on the couch watching t.v. I switch to the hallway camera. No sign of Matt. I was just about to switch to the back camera when I saw him. He was exiting our bedroom. I immediately called my wife.

  


“What the fuck is he doing in our room?!”

  


“What are you talking about he is by the keypad.”

  


“No he is not I just saw him walking out of our room!”

  


Thats when I got another call. It was Matt. I told my wife he was calling and I had to go.

  


“What the fuck do you think you’re doing walking around my house?”

  


“Phil I don’t appreciate you talking to me that way. For your information I was installing window sensors. I felt it was the least I can do for the inconvenience of the alarm going off last night.”

  


“Oh, uhh sorry, it just looked, well it just looked weird. You coming out of the bedroom like that.”

  


“Are you watching me Phil? Haha good to know the cameras work well. Don’t be concerned, the alarm is working perfectly now and your wife was great company. I’ll head out now. Enjoy your day Phil.”

  


“Uhh, thanks Matt sorry for blowing up like that.”

  


He had already hung up. 

  


After work I headed straight home, when the kids went to sleep I spoke to my wife about the window sensors. I told her he installed them free of charge. She was thankful but thought it was strange he didn’t mention it to her.

  


The next few days went smooth. Work was starting great, the family was settling in day by day and there weren’t any more issues with the alarm system. 

  


Until my wife and I decided to have a date night. 

  


We wanted to treat ourselves. The move was overwhelming and it was time for us to enjoy ourselves. We were just going out to dinner. The kids were old enough to be by themselves for a few hours plus we would be able to have eyes on them and the house with the cameras. 

  


We got all fancied up. We headed to a well reviewed steakhouse and were just enjoying each others company. That’s when I got a notification on my phone. “Front door unlocked.”

I looked at my wife puzzled and showed her my phone. She called the kids right away and I checked the doorbell camera. No one there. I was going through the other cameras and saw nothing. Then another notification. “Back door unlocked.” My wife was on the phone.

  


“Did you unlock the door?” She put it on speaker.

  


“No? We are doing homework and watching tv.”

  


“Check the doors make sure they are locked”

  


“Okay. I locked them. Is everything okay?”

  


“Yes everything is fine we just got a notification that the doors had been unlocked.”

  


She looked at me.

  


I said “Maybe the system is messing up again.”

  


“Maybe but I feel weird now, we should go.”

  


Just as I asked for the check. Another notification comes through. “There’s motion at the front door.” I check. No one there. I begin to check the cameras once again. Thats when I see the van. Matt’s van. What the hell?

  


“There’s motion at the back door.”

  


I cycle through. There is Matt standing by my back door.

  


“Back door unlocked.”

  


What the fuck.

  


I tell my wife we need to go now. 

  


“There’s motion at the front door.”

  


“Front door unlocked”

  


I call Matt. 

  


“Hello Phil”

  


“Matt what the fuck are you doing?”

  


“Just checking on you, I saw your car was gone and I just wanted to make sure everything was working as intended.”

  


“What? Why are you at my house? How are you unlocking my doors? Do you have acc-“

  


“Calm down Phil just doing my job. Everything looks great, I’m gonna take off now.”

  


I looked at my wife ”Call the cops, now!”

  


I rushed home, running through red lights and rolling through stop signs. 

  


When we arrived the police were already there. My wife ran to the kids and I stopped to talk to the officer. I explained the situation and what we were dealing with. The officer explained that it looked like we had a stalker on our hands and the best course of action was a restraining order. I only knew his first name and the company he worked for. The officer told me to look up the company number and describe to them the issues we were having. When I searched “Pristine Alarms” nothing came up. Not an app, not a website, not a phone number. I explained this to the officer. He looked confused. He explained without any information there wasn’t much he could do. He advised we stay in a hotel for a few nights until we could figure it out. I took his advice and I packed up the family and headed to a local hotel. 

  


My wife and the kids stayed “home” the next day. They were still shaken up which completely made sense. I on the other hand still had to work. I just started and had not yet built up any paid time off. It wasn’t until leaving the hotel for work that I realized I didn’t have my laptop. I forgot it in my home office. I needed it for work and it was on the way. I pulled into the drive way and ran in the house.

  


I ran to my office when the alarm started going off.

  


I ran to enter the code.

  


“Access denied”

  


I tried again.

  


“Access denied”

  


“There’s motion at the back door”

  


The siren stopped.

  


My phone rang.

  


“Hi there Phil, I see you’re home. Where were you last night? I wanted to come say hi to you and the wife but no one was here after the cops left.”

  


I didn’t say a word.

  


“Phil I can see you on the camera, you look tense. Relax bud I’m just making sure everything is alright. I just want to make sure everything is working as intended.”

  


“Who the fuck are you, “Pristine Alarms” isn’t even a real fucking company.”

  


“C’mon now Philly, I work hard at my job.”

  


“Listen you psycho, leave my family the fuck alone.”

  


“I just wanna make sure you’re safe.”

  


He hung up.

  


“Front door unlocked.”

  


I rushed to the front door ready to strangle this asshole. That’s when the back door swung open. 

  


By the time I turned around it was too late. The bat hit my ribs and I immediately collapsed to the ground. Matt was standing over me with the bat raised. The wind was knocked out of me but I had to do something. I kicked at his knee with enough force to make him drop the bat. I scampered to my feet but before I could do anything else to defend myself I heard the command.

  


“DON’T FUCKING MOVE!” The police must’ve been called by one of the neighbors.

  


My eyes locked on Matt as I saw him reaching for his phone.

  


Then the siren went off. While the officers were flustered Matt rose to his feet and sprinted out the back door. The officers gave chase but returned without Matt. That psychopath got away. I was  questioned by the police and after some slight investigation they began to take my report of what happened. After the information was gathered I planned on calling my wife to inform her of the chaos that just ensued. That’s when I noticed the all too familiar “Pristine Alarms” van parked down the street. I approached it curious to see what was inside. Maybe Matt was hiding out in there, maybe there would be SOMETHING that can show me who he really was. 

  


I opened the back door of the van. There it was. His control room. He had a monitor for every camera installed in my house. Buttons and switches for every time he wanted to unlock the doors, turn off the alarm, or set off a camera.

Why the fuck was he so obsessed with us. 

  


My phone rang.

  


I answered.

  


“Looks like everything is in working order, please call me if you need any more help Phil.”",1,1739382765.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1inwybr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1inwybr/have_you_upgraded_your_alarm_system_recently/,Have you upgraded your alarm system recently?,"That was the sales pitch. I had been unloading some boxes when the doorbell rang. When I opened the door there was a 20 something year old standing there with a blue collared shirt that read “Pristine Alarms”. 

  


“Hello Sir, have you upgraded your alarm system recently?”

  


With a friendly smile I said. “We actually don’t currently have one installed, we just moved in.”

  


“Talk about perfect timing! My name is Matt and I work for Pristine Alarms we specialize in home security. We have doorbell cameras, interior cameras, exterior cameras, automatic locks, and alarm systems. Everything to keep you and your family safe!”

  


“I appreciate the offer Matt but we have so much going on right now I don’t have the brain capacity to think about this.”

  


“I completely understand, feel free to think about it and contact me if you have any questions. I will leave you my card with my personal number on it and if you’re interested just give me a call and we can set you up!”

  


And with that he was gone. I wasn’t lying I had been doing a million things since we moved in a few days ago. I had just taken a promotion which unfortunately required a relocation. The kids weren’t too happy but they were still young so had plenty of time to make some new friends and start over. My wife has been great about this whole thing. She supported the move even though we knew it wasn’t going to be easy and was going to be a pain to start over. Later that night during our latest round of fast food I mentioned the alarm system pitch I was offered and asked her thoughts on it. 

  


“I mean, I think this is a pretty safe neighborhood but I wouldn’t mind getting one. It will give us peace of mind for when we aren’t home or when we’re sleeping.”

  


“Yeah, you’re not wrong honey. It would put us at ease. I will call the guy tomorrow and see when we can set it up.”

  


Early the next morning I gave Matt a call. I figured even if he didn’t answer I could leave a message and he would get back to me. To my surprise he answered after the first ring.

  


“Hello, this is Matt with Pristine Alarms. How can I help you.”

  


“Hey Matt, this is Phil Wheeler. You stopped by yesterday, I’m over on Harmony-“

  


“Avenue! Yes of course I remember, just moved in right? How can I help you Phil?”

  


“Well after talking it over with my other half we decided we need an Alarm system. We feel safe but a little added security won’t hurt.”

  


“Excellent! Because you just moved in, I would love to offer you a discount!” 

  


“Really? That would be amazing. What are we thinking?”

I call Matt. 

  


“Hello Phil”

  


“Matt what the fuck are you doing?”

  


“Just checking on you, I saw your car was gone and I just wanted to make sure everything was working as intended.”

  


“What? Why are you at my house? How are you unlocking my doors? Do you have acc-“

  


“Calm down Phil just doing my job. Everything looks great, I’m gonna take off now.”

  


I looked at my wife ”Call the cops, now!”

  


I rushed home, running through red lights and rolling through stop signs. 

  


When we arrived the police were already there. My wife ran to the kids and I stopped to talk to the officer. I explained the situation and what we were dealing with. The officer explained that it looked like we had a stalker on our hands and the best course of action was a restraining order. I only knew his first name and the company he worked for. The officer told me to look up the company number and describe to them the issues we were having. When I searched “Pristine Alarms” nothing came up. Not an app, not a website, not a phone number. I explained this to the officer. He looked confused. He explained without any information there wasn’t much he could do. He advised we stay in a hotel for a few nights until we could figure it out. I took his advice and I packed up the family and headed to a local hotel. 

  


My wife and the kids stayed “home” the next day. They were still shaken up which completely made sense. I on the other hand still had to work. I just started and had not yet built up any paid time off. It wasn’t until leaving the hotel for work that I realized I didn’t have my laptop. I forgot it in my home office. I needed it for work and it was on the way. I pulled into the drive way and ran in the house.

  


I ran to my office when the alarm started going off.

  


I ran to enter the code.

  


“Access denied”

  


I tried again.

  


“Access denied”

  


“There’s motion at the back door”

  


The siren stopped.

  


My phone rang.

  


“Hi there Phil, I see you’re home. Where were you last night? I wanted to come say hi to you and the wife but no one was here after the cops left.”

  


I didn’t say a word.

  


“Phil I can see you on the camera, you look tense. Relax bud I’m just making sure everything is alright. I just want to make sure everything is working as intended.”

  


“Who the fuck are you, “Pristine Alarms” isn’t even a real fucking company.”

  


“C’mon now Philly, I work hard at my job.”

  


“Listen you psycho, leave my family the fuck alone.”

  


“I just wanna make sure you’re safe.”

  


He hung up.

  


“Front door unlocked.”

  


I rushed to the front door ready to strangle this asshole. That’s when the back door swung open. 

  


By the time I turned around it was too late. The bat hit my ribs and I immediately collapsed to the ground. Matt was standing over me with the bat raised. The wind was knocked out of me but I had to do something. I kicked at his knee with enough force to make him drop the bat. I scampered to my feet but before I could do anything else to defend myself I heard the command.

  


“DON’T FUCKING MOVE!” The police must’ve been called by one of the neighbors.

  


My eyes locked on Matt as I saw him reaching for his phone.

  


Then the siren went off. While the officers were flustered Matt rose to his feet and sprinted out the back door. The officers gave chase but returned without Matt. That psychopath got away. I was  questioned by the police and after some slight investigation they began to take my report of what happened. After the information was gathered I planned on calling my wife to inform her of the chaos that just ensued. That’s when I noticed the all too familiar “Pristine Alarms” van parked down the street. I approached it curious to see what was inside. Maybe Matt was hiding out in there, maybe there would be SOMETHING that can show me who he really was. 

  


I opened the back door of the van. There it was. His control room. He had a monitor for every camera installed in my house. Buttons and switches for every time he wanted to unlock the doors, turn off the alarm, or set off a camera.

Why the fuck was he so obsessed with us. 

  


My phone rang.

  


I answered.

or in red,

How is it, 

I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack,

But I barely have the energy to get out of bed? 

What's winning this dawn,

The coffee or the melatonin?

Or am I just hung over, 

sprawled out on the lawn? 

How many times do I have to say I'm goin' in.


Before I recognize I'm just blowing off my sin? 

It's all the same?

Damn man, 

than how the fuck can't I keep up with this game? 

I barely get my footing,

Before they tell me off because something else I said was off putting. 

The girl next door;

I can't even say she became a whore. 

She was my first love,

No one taught me to second guess the dove. 

How much damage did she have to do,

Before I am allowed to sincerely say, 

'fuck you to.'? 

And little Freddie became a psychopath,

But they were all so concerned that he was failing math. 

He was my idol,

Is that why there are days I feel so homicidal? 

Was it him or my mentors that lent me their rage?

Hell bent and unable to turn the page? 

The adults in the room,

Taught us all to dance to our doom. 

And now they can't understand,

Why we won't lift a hand. 

Why would I want to save this earth,

The same place that said I never had any worth? 

What a fucking joke,

I'm supposed to smile, 

but I'll be damned if I tell a joke. 

Since when does having scars make me a hero?

Growing up, 

I was warned it would just make me a zero. 

I don't even know if you'll get the pegan or the joker,

The merciful or the fire stoker. 

I can't control my mood,

Let alone attemp to be properly understood. 

But ya, 

it's a blast to snap and win the brawl,

Have nothing, 

but at least my face is up on the wall. 

I don't know if it means I am being celebrated or hunted down.

Who knew you could be so loved and hated for a perpetual frown. 

I've never killed someone in my life,

Fuck, 

I'm even loyal to my wife. 

I've given and I've been got,

I've been livin' and felt the rot. 

I paid my dues,

And they know I still have more to lose. 

Clinging onto one last shred of humanity,

Laughing listlessly while staring into the oblivion of insanity. 

Say I do nothing but whine,

And that's just fucking fine. 

All I ever wanted was to get away,

Find my own reason to live another day. 

But you'd swear to God,

Some people think I deserve a rope, 

while others applaud. 

You wouldn't be so quick to judge,

If you truly understood how long I can hold a grudge. 

Everyone I ever trusted turned their back,

Then they had the nerve to say the knife was an attack. 

Turn the other cheek,

Only ever meant, 

become one of the meek. 

Every drop of blood I drew,

I gave twice as much, 

but only heaven knew. 

People get what they deserve,

And this is my sentence to serve. 

This world has become nothing but a pitiless job,

And your soul is just something to rob. 

We don't care if you have regrets,

Society hates more than it forgets. 

What's in a name?

I'll tell you, 

the answer is endless fucking shame. 

Cogs creak and crack along,

Break your back to add to the song. 

Forget the comparison to a machine,

This world is a graveyard, 

twisted and obscene. 

For just a moment of release,

Expect them give you the fleece. 

What's the newest miracle pill today?

Therapy to save your life, 

but you've got to pay. 

Another long con,

But it won't be long before you are gone. 

How many of us have to die for one last cheer?

All I ever asked for was a nod and a beer. 

But being fine isn't good enough.

Say you are doin' ok, 

and they'll call that bluff. 

All those skills, 

on one page,

Your life summarized by acting your age. 

Every ounce of rebellion,

Just justifies the hell you are in. 

Conformity or collapse,

Deformity or another relapse. 

I don't want to be here anymore,

When living my life has become a senseless chore.

Hi all,

So my partner has a child (13M) with a one night stand that he used to work with. She is older than him, got him drunk at 19 and wanted to have a baby with him so he would want to be with her, but regardless to the point. 

A few months ago now she sent us a message asking for more money, when we refused due to our own circumstances she went  to CSA. He is not on the birth certificate and raised the point that he would like to have a DNA test so he could go on the birth certificate, but still accepted the fact he will be paying money, (never disputed it).


She is now telling the child that my partner doesn’t believe he is the dad, and basically doesn’t want him. She has made claims we basically abuse the boy with the following points;

-We make him eat vegetables, he goes back home and moans 
-We make him eat spicy food, it’s literally seasoning (paprika, black pepper etc)
-We make him eat on the floor, i do not own a dining table, and he made so much mess on my new sofa and he sits at the coffee table. 
-She is annoyed he doesn’t have his own bedroom, i’m currently pregnant with my first, in my tiny flat my partner moved into. 
- Extra info, her family is extremely rich and can’t gather that other people don’t have the same luck and fortune.

She has told my partner he isn’t allowed to see his son, and has messaged him saying that his son “hates him” “never wants to see him again” 

Is there any advice? I can’t help but grow this resentment because his son is making all these things up when i’ve tried my absolute best to help, and look after him, and i can’t help but see him as a reflection of her and i hate her!

She is beyond nasty, and all she wants to take as much money from us as possible, the absolute little we have.

As soon as Willa hears the key in the front door, he races to the hallway as quickly as allowed by his precarious three inch heels.

His wife and her lover crash through the entrance, entangled in each other’s arms as if they are wrestling.

Standing to full attention, his hands gripping his apron, Willa runs through the words he is going to use. He will ask his Master if he may speak. That will be the best way forward, as Master likes politeness from his maid.

If given permission then he will ask a question of his employer, rather than making a statement. So he might say, ‘Master, thank you for allowing me to speak?’ Then he will say why he is unhappy with the children witnessing his punishment. In Willa’s mind, his Master will be delighted by Willa’s initiative and say it will never happen again.

Perhaps even award him two smiley stickers on his behaviour board? Or maybe four for taking the initiative?

The Bull has now pressed Avery up against the wall next to one of their large, framed wedding pictures. Adding insult to injury, of course to Willa, who is watching his marriage being desecrated by Marvin’s lust for the woman he married.

The amorous couple shed their coats with their mouths still locked on each other.

As Willa watches the coats tumble around them, he makes a note to hang them neatly in the cupboard under the stairs.

Like a single entity, totally embedded in each other’s arms, the passionate couple passes Willa’s wide-eyed, nervous figure and start clumsily up the stairs.

It is now or never!

Willa closes his eyes and says, “Master! I wonder if we may have a short moment, to have a little chat. We could run over …”

Breaking away from Avery’s gaping mouth, Marvin shakes his head.

“For fuck’s sake. Get back to changing my son’s nappy, or something. Can’t you see we’re busy?”

Avery smiles dreamily at her maid, “Willa, make a fresh pot of coffee. We have a visitor in half an hour.”

“A visitor?” A shocked maid asks, her eyebrows disappearing under her girly fringe.

Avery flaps a hand in his direction. “Busy. Will tell you later.”

They then resume their lovemaking up the stairs as an anxious maid sets about making fresh coffee.

Who the hell can the caller be? Hopefully, not the dreadful dominant sister Nicola, who will make his life a misery again.

When the exhausted couple finally returns to the kitchen, Marvin is in his suit torusers, bare feet, and his shirt open from the chest up, exposing his forest of a hairy chest. A dishevelled Avery with her dress creased pecks her lover’s unshaven jaw before settling in her place near the patio doors.

Willa obviously wants to know who is coming.

He settles their coffees before them and says, “Master, Mistress, who might be …”

Marvin gets out his tablet and, without looking at Willa, says, “Maid, there are boys clothes in my bedroom. Get them out on the bed in piles. Shirts, pants, I don’t know, whatever’s in my bedroom”

By ‘my bedroom’, the Bull, of course, meant Willa and Avery’s bedroom. He seemed to be stealing away all of Willa’s life.

Willa is perplexed. “Boys clothes, Master?”

Avery chuckles, “Silly. He means your stuff. Your Master is moving more of his clothes and shoes in. he just needs more space in the walk-in closet and drawers. So we need to get your clothes out of there.”

Oh!

“Yes, Mistress. Shall I find room for them in the maid bedroom?”

Avery smiles, it is a sympathetic smile, “No, just be a good girl and do as your Master has ordered. I am not sure now would be a good time to be naughty, would it? After what happened this morning?”

Sighing as discreetly as he can, Willa thinks back to his beating within earshot of his little children.

Worse, he has lost a string of privileges. A frowning Willa knows Master has already banned him from using Master’s vibrator for two days, and he’s not allowed to use his PC without permission. According to a grumpy master, ‘silly, naughty maids cannot expect to enjoy privileges unless they behave!’

Avery says, “So put the shoes at the bottom of the bed. And make sure you pile shirts on top of shirts and keep your suits separate.”

“Yes, Mistress.”

Obviously, Willa would like to say that he could put them all in the garage, but being the maid, he knows his views are not sought.

Just ten minutes later, while placing all his old underwear on the corner of the bed, he hears the doorbell ring.

He makes his way downstairs to hear a very feminine, girly voice in the hallway. Willa stops, not wishing to be seen, but it is too late. Already a slight, red headed girl, in jeans and tee shirt is standing at the foot of the stairs.

“Oh hi,” she beams at Willa, “Is this your maid, Marvin?”

“Yeh,” Marvin grunts. “She’ll help you. You got enough bags?”

“Oh sure,” the girl says, as if anxious to please. “I have bags for all manner of clothing and shoes.”

“Willa,” Marvin barks, making the maid jump, “This is Miss Laura. She’s from the charity shop and will be taking those useless boy’s clothes away. You make sure you help her. Got it?”

Taking away Willa’s male clothes?

“Well, yes, Master, of course. But …”

Marvin is already talking to Laura again.

“Make sure the maid has got all the clothes out. She’s a bit of dumb bitch so you double check.”

Laura smiles, “Of course, Marvin.”

The red head drags up the stairs a pile of clothing bags and cases.

As she busies herself putting all of Willa’s shirts into a case, she says to the shocked Willa, “Wow, what a dishy man! Is it true what they say about maids?” She laughs, “I bet he’s got his hands all over you!”

Willa is shocked. Laura thinks he is a real girl!

“Well, no, Miss Laura, not really, I …”

Laura has already packed the largest case and zipped it shut. “And that super maid outfit! It’s to die for. I’d love to serve a real man like that in that sexy number! Oh my God! You are living the dream.”

Willa smiles, she hadn’t thought anyone else would appreciate the joy of being a cute maid for a household.

Laura places the case on the floor and starts filling another with Willa’s tee shirts.

“I can see why he wants to get shot of these clothes. They are way too small for him. Who do they belong to?”

It is too embarrassing for Willa to say that the clothes belong to him, and he is no longer allowed to wear them.

He changes the subject.

“Miss Laura, why are you helping me pack these old clothes?”

She is surprised.

“Oh sorry. I didn't say. I can be so dumb sometimes. I am from the charity shop. Marvin, oh my God he is soooo cool, wants to help us by supplying clothes to our shop. And some of these outfits are so swish and expensive. He is so, so kind. Imagine that. Oh, Willa, could you carry down these two bags, please? Just leave them on the door step for me.”

Could he? When was the last time someone asked him to do something rather than ordering him?

“Yes, of course, Miss Laura, but I think there’s been a mistake.”

Like everyone else Laura is uninterested in what a maid has to say and continues with packing the shirts.

He carries the two cases down and obediently places them near the stairs. Obviously, Master hasn’t thought this through. This would be a delicate conversation as Master doesn’t like being challenged.

He tiptoes to the kitchen where he can see his Master is bent over his tablet with work stuff. So Willa takes a deep breath and addresses his wife. Mistress is more understanding than Master.

“Mistress, sorry to trouble you, but why are my clothes going to the charity shop? I mean wouldn’t it be better if we keep them in the garage cupboards until after all this is over. I mean then I …”

Avery’s eyes flicker with impatience.

“Maid. We’ve discussed this and …”

Mistress, sorry to interrupt you, but we haven’t discussed this or …”

Avery sits bolt upright, and Willa knows it is time to shut up.

His wife’s mouth is tight, “Oh God, you can be dumb. Not you. I have discussed this with your Master. Why on earth would I discuss it with you?”

Oh!

“Well, yes, Mistress. But obviously, one day, this will be over, and I will need male clothes and …”

Marvin leans back in his chair with hooded eyes, “Maid. Just do as you are told. Unless of course you think you want me to warm your cute arse with my belt?”

Cute arse? Stepping back with a giggle, Willa thinks, he likes my bottom. How about that?

“Oh no, sorry. Master. No!”

His arse is still aflame from the beating he received this morning just outside the kitchen in which his own daughters heard every whack.

Avery relaxes. “Don’t worry, maid.” She pauses, seeking the right words. “I’m sure we can get round to getting you new boy clothes,” she pauses, “if we need to. How does that sound?”

With Marvin still studying Willa, as if seeking any naughtiness, Willa smiles and says, “Oh, I see. That makes perfect sense.”

Marvin grunts a laugh, “Sure. As long as it makes sense to the maid everything’s all right. Now get your fat arse upstairs. And you make sure that all drawers are cleared of the boy clothes.”

“Yes, Master, of course, Master.”

Avery says slowly, “Maid, you won’t forget any items of yours like your gardening stuff in the garage? Or your gym stuff in the office?”

Oh!

It suddenly hits Willa that his boy past is being erased. His voice shakes with panic.

“Perhaps Mistress, it would be helpful to keep my garden clothes in case Master wants the lawn cut and …”

Avery’s eyes half close with impatience. “Maid, if you think my staff are going outside in ugly, ugly, rubbish attire you do not know me. I was thinking more about lovely little shorts and a cropped top for you when gardening.”

Marvin chuckles, “Sounds hot!”

Willa is shaken. “Yes Mistress, but that will be outside. I am sure Mistress doesn’t want the neighbours to see me …”

“Dressed like a cute maid?” Avery grins. “Doing her gardening errands? Oh yes, I do. In fact, I’ve seen the most darling shorts for you. Your Master won’t be able to keep his hands off your arse.”

Marvin grunts one of his ugly laughs and poor Willa’s brain is flung into the dual state of humiliation and fear, now coupled with arousal in his spiked chastity cage. He so much wants to see these desirable shorts but feels safer if his boys clothes were still around for emergencies.

In his aroused and frightened state, feeling as if he is being trapped, poor Willa suffers the indignity of removing all his male clothes from the house.

It is all going too far!

Sadly, for poor Willa, that very lunch time, there will be a second visitor who will help further relegate Willa from being anything other than maid of the house.



46.

Willa is sulking in his room when the doorbell tings for a second time that day.

Not allowed to play with Master’s vibrator and not allowed to play games on his PC, he sits on his bed in his maid’s uniform, with his head in his hands. His arse still flaming red from his morning beating which his children had heard.

And now his ‘boy clothes’, as Master called them, have all been removed from the house.

No maid had felt more sorry for themselves.

He understood why Marvin has removed his privileges for a couple of days, but really, what was a maid supposed to do between chores?

He needed something to distract himself from the nightmare thought that all his old clothes, his boy clothes according to the Bull, had been taken to the charity shop. Even the designer suits he had bought when he sold his business were now languishing unappreciated in a shop in the city.

So unfair!

He is still sighing when the doorbell rings.

Quickly he is up on his heels, straightening out his maid’s dress and checking his make up and hair in the mirror.

He moves to the top of the stairs as a giggling Avery answers it.

“Jackson! Marvin told me about you.”

Another pout. Avery was allowed to call Marvin by his Christian name, even though Willa had not been given that particular ‘privilege’.

A masculine voice, low and growly, “Hey, Avery. Marvin said you were stunning. He wasn’t lying!”

Another giggle, “Oh, come on in.” Then Avery shouts up the stairs. “Maid! Maid!”

What?

Willa steps back towards his room. He doesn’t want to be seen by a man when he is dressed like this.

But Avery’s voice is now firm, harsh. It is the one that always brings Willa to complete attention. “Maid! Down here now!”

It is a sufficiently harsh tone to have Willa scuttling down the stairs in his heels, only remembering half way down how short is his dress.

He freezes on the bottom step.

Jackson is tall, more willowy than Marvin, but with the same aggressive masculine features. He has dark closely cropped, dark hair and wears an elegant blue jacket that shouts its price tag at Willa.

What holds Willa to the spot is the way the stranger is ogling him, as if Willa is merely an object to be lusted over. The dark eyes running without hurry up and down Willa’s legs and small breasts created by the corset.

Willa cautiously steps closer and stands behind his wife, seeking protection from the visitor's piercing gaze.

Jackson grins, he clearly shares Marvin’s manly confidence.

“Wow. I’ve never seen a maid like that before. Wow-eee. Like in the movies.”

Avery chuckles, “Oh, do stop being shy, maid, and thank Mr Hunter for the compliment.”

Willa’s wife is clearly both entertained and complimented by this man’s attention for her maid.

Willa swallows and squeaks, “Thank you Mr Hunter.”

Marvin suddenly in the hallway. “Hey maid! What you waiting for? Get Jackson a drink!”

“Yes, Master,” Willa says, her voice still shaky. “Mr Hunter, what may I get you?”

The man laughs. “Babe. That would be a helluva long list.”

Everyone, bar the blushing Willa, laughs.

Jackson says, “Let’s start with a beer.” He looks to Marvin, “Not too early, yeh?”

Marvin says, “Na. I’ll join you. Maid. Two beers and whatever your Mistress wants. Jackson why don’t you get your kit out of the car. Set it up in the living room?”

Avery says, “I’ll have a white wine, maid.”

Willa is so relieved to escape to his sanctuary of the kitchen that it is a moment before he hears the metallic banging in the hallway. He wonders what exactly Mr Hunter’s kit is.

Carrying the tray of drinks clinking into the sitting room he sees exactly what ‘the kit’ is. Its photography paraphernalia. Stands. Lights. And the sort of beefy cameras you don’t see much of these days, with long and chubby lenses.

Marvin and Avery are stood before the closed curtains, enveloped in each other’s arms, while Mr Hunter takes their pictures with a careful intensity.

Stomach twists as Willa watches the lovers kiss passionately while Mr Hunter skips about them clicking his camera.

He places the tray on the coffee table wondering why they are having so many pictures taken. It reminds Willa of his wedding with Avery and the photographer clicking them all the time.

Marvin says, “I want one with the maid too. On her knees before us.”

Mr Hunter laughs, and Willa’s face is now burning red.

“Sure,” Mr Hunter takes a long cool look up the maid’s legs and body. “Be full length, like the first shots.”

Mr Hunter mounts the camera on the stand as Marvin clicks his fingers and points to his feet.

Willa rushes to comply. Anything to gain more smiley stickers for his behaviour chart.

The carpet feels rough through his stockings as he settles before the loving couple.

“Look at the camera,” Mr Hunter says. “Marvin, can your maid smile?”

Willa doesn’t need instructions from his Master to smile as winningly as he can for the camera.

A string of clicks indicate that his pose has been caught forever.

There were more poses with Willa looking up at her Master with wonder and awe, and then similarly with his Mistress. A shot of master holding Avery, while a pouting maid stands to one side.

Marvin takes a long swig of his beer. “Listen, me and my woman are going upstairs …”

Willa nibbles his pink lips at the words ‘his woman’. What a boasting bastard Marvin is.

“Hang around. The kids will be home soon. I want shots of them with me and Avery, and then with Willa and me.”

“Sure,” Mr Hunter says. “You okay if I take a few of your maid too?”

Willa gasps, pressing his hands against his apron. Take pictures of him? Dressed like this?

He swallows, “Master, Sir, perhaps Mr Hunter shouldn’t. In case someone sees them and …”

There is a sharp tilt of Marvin’s head, bringing his demanding eyes in contact with those of Willa. The maid shuts up immediately and grips his apron tightly wishing he had stayed quiet.

Marvin announces, “Sure. Whatever you want. She’ll do as she’s told.”

There is a lustful leer from Mr Hunter that terrifies poor Willa.

As the couple leave, Mr Hunter says, “What about this cuck guy. I mean you want me to take his picture too? You know the way a hunter photographs himself with one foot on his trophy?”

Marvin laughs, “Yeh! Magic! Maid, lie on the floor.”

“Yes, Master,” Willa says obediently, wanting to make up for speaking out of turn.

He lies on his side and Marvin plants a foot on his waist and presses down a little too firmly for Willa’s liking.

Mr Hunter snaps away. “You want her smiling or grimacing?”

“How does she look right now,” Marvin asks.

Mr Hunter has to think. “Well, kinda overpowered. Big sexy eyes defeated.”

“Great,” Marvin laughs. “Maid roll over onto your tits.”

They all laugh as Willa complies, feeling a hefty foot rest on the small of his back.

“Maid,” Mr Hunter says, “Push up your arse. No. More. That’s it. Look at the camera sweetness.”

The camera clicks away.

“Now,” Mr Hunter says, “I want you to clench your little fists and shake them. Kick your heels at the same time. Yeh. Fantastic. Now look disgruntled. Yeh great!”

More pictures are taken.

“Now look angry,” Mr Hunter demands.

Willa complies.

“Enough,” Marvin says. “Me and my woman need our time.”

“Your maid is a natural model,” Mr Hunter says with genuine admiration. “The camera loves her and she complies perfectly with instructions.”

Avery beams, “Oh maid. You’ve made me very proud.”

Unsure whether he should get up from the carpet, Willa watches the bully grab Willa’s wife and kiss her. There is no doubt what they will be doing upstairs!

As they reach the hall, Mr Hunter says, “What about this dumb cuck of yours? You want him in any pictures.”

Marvin grins and nodes in the direction of the reclined maid.

“Take as many of him as you want.”

Mr Hunter’s face is a picture of confusion, thought and then slow, shocked realisation. He stares angrily at the fearful maid.

“That’s the cuck? That’s a guy?”

Willa wants to crawl behind the sofa, or if given permission to stand, to race to his room and hide.

The giggling Avery is carried upstairs and their bedroom door, once that of Willa’s, slams shut.

Mr Hunter glares with fiery eyes at the poor maid.

“Erm.” Willa’s voice is shaking, “Please may I stand, Mr Hunter?”

“What the …” Mr Hunter advances on Willa who tries to make himself as small as possible.

The furious photographer stands over the terrified maid who dares not look up.

“You one of these gay boys? Eh?”

“No, no, sir. Really.”

“Then what the … I mean what the hell are you doing dressed ….Jesus H Christ.”

“Please, Sir. I have some chores to do in the kitchen and …”

“Yeh. Piss off out of here. Now!”

There is such rage in Mr Hunter’s voice that Willa crawls away from him before rising onto his heels and racing out of the room.

He slams the kitchen door shut and leans against the cold wood. His eyes close to shut out the shame.

That was a nightmare.

How could Marvin do that to him? Was it meant to be further punishment after his naughtiness that morning?

He is in one of those humiliatingly defeated frames of mind, where he can think of nothing save for the frilly panties, which are cream today, and the dreadful spiked chastity cage tormenting him under his short maid dress.

He can barely breathe as he makes his way over to the kitchen counter to clear away the beer bottles.

The door opens and Willa turns around. Oh no. It is Mr Hunter. His face is still angry and Willa is immobilized by the tall man’s fearsome presence.

“Sir, I am so sorry that …”

The words fall away. What exactly is he sorry for? It isn’t his fault, yet Willa feels responsible and knows he must be punished.

Mr Hunter advances, stopping in the middle of the kitchen, near the island that Willa hadn’t long cleaned.

“You’re really a guy? A gay boy?”

“Well, no … well, yes. I mean, yes, I am a guy, but no, I am not a …”

Mr Hunter’s eyes comb the maid’s legs, from his heels to the waist. Then they roam up to the small pert breasts and finally the pretty face.

“Turn ‘round,” he says with that quiet confidence that Willa hears from Marvin all the time.

With wooden limbs, Willa turns self-consciously to face away from the photographer. He is now feeling even more exposed and vulnerable.

Of course, he is too alarmed to realise he has reached the first high point of a maid’s life. He is obeying without any question even though he feels frozen with panic.

As Willa’s wide eyes roam blankly around with bewilderment, he feels two hands on his back push him over, so he his flat on the counter. The maid’s collar bells jingle as if laughing at the poor maid’s helpless predicament.

“Oh!”

“Tramp!” Mr Hunter utters under his breath, his breathing growing hard and loud.

Willa feels his skirt fluffed up over his waist. As he gasps, so it slips back down over his ruffled panties. Mr Hunter irritably pushes it back up and out of the way.

“Oh. Mr Hunter! Please, I …” Willa says, still wide eyed in shock.

“Slutty, gay boy!” Mr Hunter says as Willa hears the noise of a belt being quickly opened up.

A zip is pulled down and Willa knows he must say something.

“Mr Hunter, please, if … Oooooh!”

His panties are pulled down over his stocking tops to his knees.

What is happening?

Not daring to turn around Willa looks up at a calendar on the wall ahead of him as its pictures blur with his panic.

Now he can hear a fleshy noise. A sort of pumping. Oh no, Mr Hunter is masturbating behind him.

It cannot be.

There is a light spurt of a warm gooey liquid on one of Willa’s buttocks, at which point his entire brain freezes solid.

The photographer grunts through his teeth and an amazing amount of sperm is flooded over the poor maid’s exposed buttocks.

Willa hears trousers being zipped back up and a belt hooked into position. Footsteps and then the kitchen door slams shut.

The kitchen falls silent while the maid remains fixed in position.

He finds the courage to look back over his shoulder to see that he is now alone.

Should he stand? Is he allowed to pull up his panties?

He does so cautiously, feeling the hot mess spread over his lovely panties.

He stands uncomfortably, brushing down his apron and dress. His eyes remain wide open, and his lips form a pretty small circle of shock.

It is then, still frozen in shock, that Willa realises he is spurting into the front of his panties.

What is happening?

He does what all maids do when they feel lost and in shock. He starts to tidy and clean a kitchen that is already tidy and clean. Wiping down surfaces, just stopping every moment to contemplate what just happened.

It is a full twenty minutes of domestic service later that Willa hears his Master and Mistress laughing in the hallway.

Whilst the horrible bully has been having sex with Willa’s wife, the Bully’s friend has been taking advantage of him in the kitchen!

I mean, he thinks, that is what happened isn’t it? Mr Hunter took advantage of him? Ordering him to …

The kitchen door opens, a grinning Bull says, “Hey. Maid. More beers. Now!”

“Yes, Master of course Master.”

He delivers the beers on a tray into the sitting room avoiding at all costs eye contact with Mr Hunter who has rearranged some lights near the wall.

The Bull is hugging Avery on the coach. She looks sleepily content and Willa vows one day to satisfy her in the same way.

“Master,” why is Willa’s voice always so squeaky when he is intimidated, “if I may go to my room for a short rest.”

Marvin glares at him. “You aren’t going to play with yourself, are you? You know that privilege is on hold!”

“Oh yes Master, I mean no Master. Of course. No.”

Avery nods her head, “Aw. I expect my maid wants to rest her feet. Heels can be a pain.”

“Yes Mistress,” an eager maid says. “That’s it.”

“Fifteen minutes,” barks Marvin. “My kids will be back for their pictures. I need you around then. Got it?”

“Yes, Master. Of course, Master.”

For a brief moment Willa wonders why the children will be photographed but decides now will be a good time to quietly exit.

It is as he reaches the door he glances at Mr Hunter to see that the photographer is eyeing his legs and body again.

Oh my!

1inwvjw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1inwvjw,"The Andes Traverse: Bikepacking 7,000 Miles Across South American Backcountry","I’ve been cycling from the top of Alaska to the bottom of Argentina and my progression across the Andes has crept slowly, cautious, painstaking. After rounding the Darién Gap by sailboat to Cartagena was a 500-mile marathon along la Ruta del Sol. Heat indexes pushed +120°F [48°C] through Mompox toward Bucaramanga. Eight liters of water each day still wasn’t enough. The cold couldn’t come sooner. And then it stayed forever.
 
Each passing day brought new personal records for highest mountain passes. First the wintry páramos of Colombia’s Northeastern Cordillera. Purple bricks of bocadillo [guava paste] became my saving grace.
 
Then the Trampoline of Death between two militant valleys en route towards the Trans Ecuador Volcano Corridor. I crashed atop Chimborazo when the winds grew too strong. Each day saw insatiable hunts for locro de papa [bright yellow potato soup] with chicha morada [purple corn drink], but food wasn’t always so easy to find.
 
Then desert backroads across north Peru where sunkissed canyons skyrocketed beyond 16,000ft in Huayhuash y la Cordillera Blanca. Morning camp coffee was often the best part of my day, or momentary stops for sweet, sticky alfajores [traditional Latin American sandwich cookies].
 
When I look back on those roads now, my instinctual response is choked in trauma. “No way, I could never,” as if forcibly forgetting each cruel bend in the gravel. It’s been perhaps the most beautiful part of the journey thus far, but also the most backbreakingly difficult. You reach your physical and emotional capacity by 5pm each day, yet have no choice but to throw yourself past it week after week for months without letup. Your body crumbles over and over, but there’s nowhere to escape to and no way to get there.
 
From up above the clouds, each payoff remains breathtaking. Camp colors, indelible. Ahead lie Bolivia, Chile and Argentina still. It just might take some time to come down.

If I am new at IF and fast in my follicular phase (i started 2 days after my period) and I’m able to go up to 24 hours would that be too much of a shock on my body? i’m used to eating and snacking through out the day but I decided I wanted to start fasting a few days ago and just went for it.

1inwuc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1inwuc4/highfunctioning_extremely_intelligent/,"High-functioning, extremely intelligent","I started writing and got carried away. This is like a journal entry... it felt good to write it all out. Maybe others will relate. Processing something like this is extremely isolating - you question your reality, your worth, your sanity. It's inherently one perspective of a two-person situation. But getting your own narrative out of your head and somewhere physical helps.

*(way) tl;dr: Knew someone for 18-months (9 months friends, 9 months something more) who had BPD they claimed to have outgrown. I think this meant turned from externalized (overt) to internalized (quiet). Went from taking trips together and talking future parenting to sudden discard, gaslighting, and character assassination. Processing the cognitive dissonance has been painstaking. Writing out your own narrative can help.*

*---*

I was seeing someone with extremely high-functioning BPD. Except, it was written off/downplayed. Said she ""grew out of it"" and just decided she ""didn't have to live that way anymore"". We talked about misdiagnoses. We talked about a previous relationship I had with someone with overt BPD and how triggering it was for me. She was nothing like the person I had dated before. I didn't know anything about ""Quiet BPD"". I knew drastic mood swings, obvious splitting, active self-harming, and a quick cycle. She did tell me she used to self-harm decades ago. She did, at the beginning, tell me she had an ""allergy to emotional closeness"". And we did start with an understanding that we would avoid emotional strings. I still can't believe I let myself just run with this - but honestly, I was post-divorce and didn't want to seriously date anyone at the time. Red flags wrapped in layers of ambiguity, that continued through a push/pull wrapped in layers of ambiguity.

It clearly went beyond the original scope. Seeing each other weekends, spending nights; sometimes a few in a row. She is professionally and academically successful, charming, witty, beautiful, etc. Always the subtle push/pull, some comments about being unsure we would be good in a relationship, followed by being told how nice it was to have me around when I spent some days in a row. Comments that I made her feel safe, and that I showed her qualities she wanted in a partner - like it was a new realization. Stuff like this that is maybe not so typical of a friend with benefits dynamic when you were the one who threw out ""no emotional strings"" and talked of your emotional intimacy allergy. Being suddenly blindsided is emotional whiplash no matter what. Add BPD splitting and such and you will lose yourself - especially with someone who presents as highly self-aware and emotionally intelligent.

I went from a 1 week vacation with her and our respective children (our 3rd time doing that) where I was told ""I could get used to this with my lover"" during a particularly amazing day when I felt the most at peace I ever had with her, to her abruptly ending things after we didn't see each other for a couple of weeks (she wanted a little alone time which I understood after a week with three preschoolers, and one weekend where I was sick). No indication of any issue or conflict or anything troubling her regarding us. We were texting normally these weeks. She was messaging me about parenting strategies for the future. Prior to this I would say there was one single moment where explosive anger was directed at me, yelling at me in the road - but within an hour agreed to put it behind us with no apology on her end. (Spoiler: come to find out 5 months later that it wasn't put behind us.)

She ended it the same day I was going to talk to her about making it official. I seriously thought that we were both on the same page by that point... 9 months friends, 9 months 'lovers'... I'll accept my role in maintaining an unclear dynamic too long, but you don't talk about parenting strategies for the future with someone you are about to end things with. I could not have been more shocked; I couldn't even speak in person at the time and just hugged her and went home. I had absolutely no fucking idea how the emotional reality diverged so drastically and so suddenly. I needed some time to process before asking to talk more to help me understand, and I didn't get it. This is where it just became a mess and spiraled out. I was met with deflection, ambiguity, requests for space, conflicting narratives (gaslighting in retrospect), and then character attacks. When we finally met to talk in person \~3 weeks later she was completely detached. I had been talking to her almost every single day for a year and a half. It was like talking to a completely different person; cold, uncaring, carefree. Felt like I was being mocked for having feelings about any of it. ""BPD eyes"" are a real thing.

One of the things she told me was that we had clearly been distancing for months. I literally slept in her bed with her during this time. I spent multiple nights in a row. We texted and talked regularly like we had always. We took our kids out to a little amusement park. She had come over for dinner. One thing she said, like I was completely oblivious to not have seen it coming, was how we hadn't had sex for these three weeks where we were ""clearly distancing"". She told me she had a UTI one weekend, and another weekend we were both exhausted. I was in her bed regardless, cuddling, rubbing her hair like always, falling asleep together. The next week was the trip. Clearly distancing for months... this one made my fucking head spin. She may have been silently withdrawing internally, but there was nothing clear about it.

The last thing she told me, months later, was that something that happened during the vacation was a 'dealbreaker' where she felt I didn't support her how she wanted. She never expressed it. We cuddled, I kissed her, and dozed off together on the couch that night. We had that amazing next day. She was messaging me about parenting strategies for the future after. When I asked her why it didn't come up sooner she simply said 'but what was there to bring up?'. And that I can't be taken seriously as a person. And have no integrity. And bad values. And to accept the consequences of my actions. And that I never cared about her. And if I loved her it was fake. And that I only think with my dick. And that I am selfish and self-centered. With bad character. And I'm a teenager and need to grow the fuck up. And that I need to learn to take accountability for my actions. At some point she had claimed we were just friends (""great friends"", despite telling me months later that I treated her like a stranger during the ""dealbreaker""). But also told me it was functionally a relationship after. The subtle contradictions over months just kept adding up.

The 'dealbreaker' event was that a tree branch fell on her parked car at an Airbnb in the woods. She wanted to call the police. I didn't think it was necessary. There was no argument. There was no bickering. There was literally no conflict at all - a disagreement. She just got silent and seemed really upset, so I gave her space while I did my own thing for a little bit. She decided she would call them. I said ok, yeah do it, maybe a report can be helpful down the line. One came, she went outside for about 5 minutes to talk, came in, and everything was perfectly fine between us - sat on the couch together and talked about what to do next with insurance and such. I hardly thought twice about this, besides reflecting that I could have given her a hug instead of space, and could have went outside when the cop came. Months later I'm told that I ""basically showed the middle finger"" to someone concerned about the safety of my children, treated her like a stranger, and showed myself as a person who cannot be treated seriously. In my head this was such an overreaction to an unfortunate natural event that moves forward as an insurance claim and then life continues on. The emotional intensity here threw me off in the moment and my decision was to give some space. What kills me is that I was so lost in defending myself that I just accepted her narrative in the conversation about this and apologized for my ""shitty behavior"". It's hard to think clearly when someone you deeply care about is suddenly telling you how you're a garbage person and that they've felt that way for months... after you were spending together and sharing vulnerability in the meantime.

One completely speculative side note - she made some weird comments about how she thought the cop was the brother of someone she apparently went on a date or talked to some time the year before... I do wonder if after this trip she reached out that person and monkey-branched. Who knows; it's not really the point anyway.

What also came up were three specific times she said I was unreliable and a claim of ""dozens of those situations"". One of the three was just factually wrong. The other was a literal miscommunication with bad cell service so I was about 5 minutes late for something (and she yelled at me in person in the middle of the road over this). The third, and at least somewhat understandable, was a time I didn't pull together a weekend trip within driving distance I wanted to plan for us. Overconfident on a fun idea doing something I had never done before (renting an RV, turned out I needed to add a tow package to my car and such). I tried to salvage it in the end offering to rent a place with a few days in advance, and she was the one who canceled. We had already had the time blocked for each other...

This all came out after her response to me saying that I still wanted to be together was to tell me how depressed, hollow, and dead inside she was. That she thought she would be single for 10-20 years, and a comment that she thinks she is one of ""the bad people"". She said she wasn't sure she'd be alive if not for her daughter. I told her I didn't think I could be friends like this. Before she left, and this moment in particular crystallized it all for me, she made such a light-hearted but loaded comment: ""heh, BPD and emotional intimacy"". That night I finally cracked, drank a bottle of wine, and sent a stupid message at 3am asking her if that was all a way of telling me she was seeing someone else. I do regret being reactive here but I had been an emotional dumping ground and given mixed signals for weeks again at this point. I apologized, was ignored for 2 weeks, and sent a closure message taking accountability for the moment of selfishness, expressing appreciation for the time together, wishing her the best, and hoping to reconnect at some time in the future. Got a full character assassination in response.

Oh, and she told me she felt that way for months even though we had been reconnecting and went for coffee/dinner, skiing, and she brought her kid over to play with mine again - even acknowledged that there was real depth and feelings between us after skiing, asked about the move forward (then avoided and changed the topic). I made it no secret I still had stronger feelings throughout this, I told her multiple times I wanted to be together. But she was finally telling me then after weeks of reconnecting because ""I'm just not filtering myself to be nice and not hurt your feelings"". I over-apologized and took blame for things I shouldn't have. My mind was a mess. None of it made sense, reality was broken. Cognitive dissonance overload.

Naturally, the next night after she sent me a message saying she thought she was having panic attacks. I asked what was going on. In the morning she replied ""nothing more than I already wrote"" then ignored talking about it - but responded all friendly about a earthquake we had in the area. Then a few days later an Amazon link for something for my parents house. I thanked her, told her I was pretty hurt about the other day but it was all good (by this point I *finally* realized we weren't going to have any emotionally honest talks). I asked her what the move forward was. She said she didn't know. I asked if she wanted to agree we both contributed to a difficult dynamic and that we didn't have to split hairs here. Yes, using the word split was very intentional. She said ""sure"".

It was the most fucked up of experience of my 'adult' life at 34. I completely self-abandoned. I accepted her narratives. I apologized for things that I don't agree with. I thought I was the most fucked up, insecure, anxious person ever that understood absolutely nothing about human relationships because I was struggling so much - and basically told her so (just to constantly get dismissed in response). It's taken me \~5 months to get my head in a place where I don't feel constantly underwater, but I still struggle with acceptance some days even though generally I can rationalize what happened.

It was all made worse because I have childhood trauma around ambiguous loss that she knew about... and she was almost a PhD in Psychology with (of course) her own trauma. Beyond all the other contradictions and projections, it still blows my mind she accused me of not caring about her as a person considering this simple fact in isolation. It's hard to describe the effect this has - it isn't that I can't handle loss, being alone, or am typically anxious in relationships - it's that I had a full trauma response to someone I cared for seeming to be a completely different human from one time I saw them to the next.

You can't build a healthy relationship of any kind (friend or partner) with someone who harbors resentments, projects insecurities, lashes out and never apologizes, and just refuses accountability of their own. We started with an agreement for open and honest communication, and we ended with her rationalizing how apparently that kind of communication is codependent. I literally asked some previous exes if they thought I was codependent - one laughed at the idea - issues yes, but usually in the opposite direction. I'll never really know what the internal process was, but I do take solace in knowing I always approached with the motivation to grow.

Your mind is trying to integrate an experience that defies all logic and prior experiences with relationships. Especially with high-functioning untreated BPD in an intelligent person; they will maintain a façade of rationality while delivering sophisticated manipulation whether consciously or not. They will take their internal experience and retroactively project it outward while their actual behaviors communicated the exact opposite. It just is traumatizing, especially when you deeply trusted and cared for the person and took them at their word. You will suddenly find out that what you thought was a shared reality was so far from the truth. She took real events, stripped any context, bent the truth here and there, reframed them to support the sudden narrative shift, and used them as evidence of character flaws.

One thing she said to me during a more vulnerable conversation was: ""I want to conquer men's minds"". Sounds like cartoon villainy. I thought she was joking at the time. She did some parts work / IFS in the past. If you are that self-aware, commit to actual treatment. You are not the empathetic, sensitive, world-saving, deeply feeling person you project outward if you actually know this part of yourself and choose to do nothing (while lecturing me on integrity). You're just maintaining a carefully constructed image because you are afraid. That's the real conflict of values - the ethical dimension here. It's telling me you will actively choose avoidant partners. It's admitting to being one of the ""bad"" ones. It's being aware that your patterns are considered disordered and that they create ripple effects of trauma in others. The impact isn't contained in **just you**. Self-awareness without the commitment to change becomes its own form of emotional violence.

Despite all of it, I do care about her. I have empathy, even if there's no way to tell her without the defenses going up. We went from mutual understanding to character assassination. She didn't choose this just like I didn't choose my childhood or biology. I walk away retraumatized, but with a spotlight on areas of my own to heal and grow.

I'd appreciate your thoughts about when you give someone your phone number. For a long time I wouldn't meet with someone unless I had talked with him first on the phone. Then I encountered guys who became what I call Space Invaders, texting and calling way way too much before we even met.

So recently I went the other direction, giving out my number only the day before we agreed to meet and saying here's my number in case you need to get ahold of me. Because I would rather risk a 1 hour or less coffee date with someone boring  than having my space invaded with constant calls and texts before meeting.

Now that's backfired too. I had a brief phone call with someone the day before we were to meet, which he then postponed because of bad weather. Which was fine only he then started calling me and texting me multiple times per day including one morning at 7:15 and when I hadn't returned his call by 8:45 he called again and left another message demanding that I call him. So of course huge red flag. And I bowed out of meeting then blocked him.

I'm telling myself that I'm glad to learn early on that he was a no. But it still leaves me with the question of when to give out my phone number! I could get a Google voice number. Does this really help, in your opinion? I detest, and I mean really hate, the Space Invaders. What do you think? What's your suggestion?

My last post here was about one month ago when my wife worked on my birthday and made no effort to make it up to me, despite knowing how much it meant. Since then, nothing has changed and if anything, it’s gotten worse.

She recently started taking Lexapro without discussion, and there’s been no attempt at counseling or any other effort to address our issues. If she was struggling mentally, I get that, but why make such a big decision that will obviously affect our relationship, and from what I've read, especially our sex life? If she acknowledges that something is wrong enough to go on meds, why not also work on fixing the issues in our relationship which is the likely contributing to the struggles she's experiencing?

A bit more than a week ago, before we left for vacation, I tried to initiate a quickie. She rejected me with a knee-jerk response, “I just did my nails, no.” That response upset me, and when recognized this she followed up with, “Well, I think I have a UTI, and we’ll have sex in St. Thomas.” Spoiler: we didn’t.

The first two days of the trip, she had a stink face and acted distant. On the third day, when she finally seemed to be in a good mood, I made a light joke about how it was nice to finally see her happy. That turned into another fight. At that point, I explicitly told her this is a major issue and that I’ve brought it up for a decade, and yet there’s always a reason why we can’t be intimate and at some point she needs to start having some accountability for the condition are marriage is, because I listen and make efforts, I've kept all of my promises, etc.. I also said that my life is good, it was good before her, it's good now and it will be good after, the only issue is this space she maintains between us. It seemed to resonate a little bit. After the fight we just tried to have a nice trip...

We came home, and Monday morning I texted her, “Let’s mess around tonight or tomorrow” to which she said ""we'll figure it out."" Monday night, she was “so tired.” Yesterday, I got home from work, unload the groceries, cooked dinner, cleaned up everything, had the kids take care of the pets and wash up for bed, and she just slept on the couch (lexapro?) during this and while I played with our kids until bed time. She woke up after I tucked them in to say goodnight and proceeded to explain how she doesn't feel right (lexapro?). Alright, I'm not gonna beg. 

This morning, I was grumpy, and I'm thinking I'm more than justified. She made me my coffee which she never does and while I was outside shoveling snow, she flashed her breasts at me. When I came in, she asked, “How did you like that?”

I told her bluntly, “It’s nice. All these gestures are nice and I appreciate them and cherish them, but they’re not a replacement for sex. It doesn’t change the fact that we’ve had sex only twice since the new year. It doesn’t change that when I texted you on Monday about messing around, the days came and went, and nothing happened.”

She got defensive and said, “Well, you have to remember that I’ve been dealing with actual problems. I’ve been nauseous, I was sick for a while, and we’ve been fighting a lot.”

I said, “So what I’m hearing is that your problems are real, and mine aren’t. But the feelings I get from lack of sex are very real and are causing problems for me. It sounds like you’re deprioritizing me because you don’t think my issues are real.”

She started getting more defensive, but I stopped her and said, “I’m trying to communicate with you, not to make you defensive, but to express the truth before this becomes a bigger problem.”

I feel like I’m about to pop. It’s hard to focus. I’ve communicated my needs clearly and respectfully, and instead of real action, I get half-measures - hugs, coffee, a breast flash - all while sex is continually ignored or pushed aside for excuses. I don’t want to feel like I’m begging my wife for basic intimacy. I don’t want to keep fighting just to get her to care. Mind you, sex occurred once about every week or two. We have kids, we're busy, so I was OK with that arrangement. But since about September, we're averaging far less, closer to once a month and it makes me feel like my stomach is in knots and my heart is lodged in my throat.

What do I do? At what point do I accept that this is just who she is now and that my needs will never be met in this marriage?

tl;dr My wife and I have been fighting over lack of intimacy for years, and I’m at my breaking point. Since my last post a month ago (when she worked on my birthday and did nothing to make up for it), nothing has changed. She started Lexapro without discussing it with me, constantly has excuses for why we can’t have sex, and when I try to communicate, she gets anxious and defensive. I feel like I’m going to explode. At what point do I accept that my needs will never be met in this marriage?

# Tips for Successfully Transitioning to Life in Costa Rica with Your Digital Nomad Visa

Transitioning to life in Costa Rica with your Digital Nomad Visa can be an exciting yet challenging experience. Here are some essential tips to help you navigate the process smoothly and enjoy your new life in paradise.

**Research Before You Go**

Before you pack your bags, take the time to research the areas of Costa Rica where other digital nomads are thriving. Popular spots like San Jose, Tamarindo, and Monteverde offer a vibrant community and amenities tailored for remote workers. Understanding the local culture, weather patterns, and lifestyle will help you prepare better for your move.

**Secure Accommodation**

Once you have decided on a location, secure your accommodation before your arrival. Many digital nomads prefer short-term rentals to get a feel for the area. Websites like Airbnb and Vrbo can be useful for finding temporary housing. For longer stays, consider signing a lease for an apartment or house. Look for places with reliable internet connections, as this is crucial for remote work.

**Set Up Your Workspace**

Establishing a comfortable workspace is vital for productivity. Whether you choose a co-working space or set up a home office, ensure your setup includes a reliable computer, high-speed internet, and ergonomic furniture.

**Understand Local Laws and Regulations**

Familiarize yourself with Costa Rican laws and regulations. This includes understanding the terms of your Digital Nomad Visa, tax obligations, and other legal requirements. Consulting with a local lawyer or immigration specialist can provide clarity and peace of mind. It’s also wise to register with your embassy or consulate to stay informed about any updates or changes in regulations.

**Get Health Insurance**

Healthcare in Costa Rica is generally good, but it's important to have health insurance coverage. Consider purchasing international health insurance that covers medical emergencies and routine care. This will give you peace of mind and ensure you have access to quality healthcare when needed.

**Learn Basic Spanish**

While many Costa Ricans speak English, especially in tourist-heavy areas, learning basic Spanish can greatly enhance your experience. Simple phrases like ""hola,"" ""gracias,"" and ""por favor"" go a long way in building rapport with locals. Consider taking language classes either online or in person to improve your skills.

**Explore the Culture**

Costa Rica is known for its rich culture and warm hospitality. Take the time to explore local markets, festivals, and traditional dishes. Engaging with the community can help you feel more at home and provide a deeper appreciation of your new surroundings. Joining local clubs or groups related to your interests can also help you connect with like-minded individuals.

**Stay Connected**

Maintaining connections with friends and family back home is important. Set up regular video calls and share your experiences through social media. This not only keeps you connected but also allows you to share your adventures with those who care about you.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid When Applying for the Costa Rica Digital Nomad Visa

Applying for the Costa Rica digital nomad visa can be an exciting process, but it's crucial to avoid common pitfalls that could delay or even derail your application. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you navigate through the process smoothly.

# Not Meeting the Financial Requirement

The Costa Rica digital nomad visa requires proof of sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay. A common mistake is underestimating the financial requirement. As of the latest updates, applicants must show proof of having at least $3,000 in their bank account or equivalent. It's essential to ensure that your financial documents clearly demonstrate this amount. Submitting insufficient evidence or incorrect statements can lead to rejection.

# Failing to Provide Correct Documentation

One of the most frequent errors is submitting incomplete or incorrect documentation. Make sure you gather all necessary documents before starting the application process. These typically include a valid passport, proof of income, travel insurance, and proof of accommodation. Each document must be recent and reflect accurate information. Double-check everything before submission to avoid any discrepancies.

# Misunderstanding the Purpose of Stay

Another common mistake is misunderstanding the purpose of the digital nomad visa. This visa is designed for individuals who wish to work remotely from Costa Rica. If your primary reason for visiting is tourism or business activities unrelated to remote work, you might need a different type of visa. Be clear about your intentions and ensure they align with the visa requirements.

# Ignoring the Travel Insurance Requirement

Travel insurance is a mandatory requirement for the digital nomad visa. Many applicants overlook this detail, which can result in delays or denial of the visa. Your insurance should cover medical expenses and repatriation. Make sure to choose a reputable provider and verify that your policy meets the minimum coverage requirements specified by the Costa Rican government.

# Submitting an Incomplete Application Form

Filling out the application form incorrectly or incompletely is another common error. Take your time to fill out each section accurately. Pay attention to details like your name, date of birth, and address, as these must match exactly with your passport. Any mismatch can cause issues with your application. Consider having someone else review your completed form to catch any potential errors.

# Not Checking Visa Validity Periods

Understanding the validity period of the digital nomad visa is crucial. The initial visa is usually granted for 90 days, but you can apply for extensions. Failing to plan for extensions or misinterpreting the duration can lead to complications. Always check the official website for the most current information on visa validity periods and extension procedures.

# Choosing the Wrong Type of Visa

There are various types of visas available for foreigners entering Costa Rica, including tourist visas, student visas, and work visas. Choosing the wrong type can lead to complications. For instance, if you intend to work remotely, the digital nomad visa is the appropriate choice. However, if you plan to engage in business activities or start a company, you may need a different visa. Research thoroughly to select the right visa type for your situation.

# Ignoring the Importance of Accommodation Proof

Proof of accommodation is a key requirement for the digital nomad visa. Many applicants assume that staying in hotels or short-term rentals is sufficient. However, you may need to provide a lease agreement or other proof of long-term residence. If you plan to stay in multiple locations, consider providing documentation for your main base of operations. Not meeting this requirement can result in a rejected application.

# Submitting Outdated Documents

Using outdated documents is a common oversight. Ensure all your documents are current and valid. For example, your passport should have at least six months of validity remaining from the date of entry into Costa Rica. Similarly, any financial statements or employment letters should be dated within the last three months. Submitting outdated documents can raise red flags and delay the processing of your application.

# Not Following Up After Submission

After submitting your application, it's important to follow up regularly. Some applicants assume that once they submit their documents, the process is entirely in the hands of the authorities. However, proactive communication can help resolve any issues promptly. Keep track of your application status and respond quickly to any requests for additional information or clarification.

# Ignoring Local Customs and Regulations

Being unaware of local customs and regulations can impact your experience in Costa Rica. While not directly related to the visa application, understanding the culture and laws can help you integrate better and avoid unnecessary issues. Research local customs, dress codes, and legal requirements to ensure a smooth transition into your new environment.

By avoiding these common mistakes, you can increase your chances of successfully obtaining the Costa Rica digital nomad visa. Remember, thorough preparation and attention to detail are key to a seamless application process. Good luck!

# Conclusion

Navigating the process of obtaining a Costa Rica Digital Nomad Visa can seem daunting, but by understanding the eligibility criteria and requirements, following a step-by-step guide, and being aware of the benefits and common pitfalls, you can make the transition smoother. Remember, this visa opens up a world of opportunities, allowing you to live and work in a beautiful, vibrant country. Embrace the adventure, take advantage of the perks, and enjoy the flexibility this visa provides. With careful planning and preparation, you'll be well-equipped to thrive in your new environment, making the most of your time in Costa Rica.

Here is my THIRD attempt at a query. I've taken all the feedback about vagueness and have tried my best to incorporate it. All feedback is helpful :) (Also, should I be writing in my query that this is new adult instead of adult? I'm not sure).



Dear \[Agent’s Name\],

I am thrilled you’re looking for \[blank\] and am excited to submit THE ROOMMATE REFLEX for your consideration. This 80,000 word adult contemporary romance explores ambition, self-healing, and the subjectivity of success. It will appeal to fans of Ali Hazelwood’s *The Love Hypothesis* and Lana Ferguson’s *The Fake Mate*.

Amelie Liu is not having a myocardial infarction— Stefan Song is just making coffee in the kitchen… shirtless.

With plans to follow her parents’ footsteps and attend St. Helena Medical School, Amelie is too focused on school to see the bigger picture— she’s unhappy and drifting from friendships with her roommates. When her academic priorities spark an argument with her best friend, who subsequently moves out, she’s forced to look beyond the textbooks for a replacement. 

Enter Stefan Song, the college town’s ex-soccer star who mysteriously quit the team. He’s eager to outrun the wild child rumors and leave his “soccer star” reputation behind. Nowhere to go after leaving athletic housing, he’s desperate for a place to live. Amelie lets Stefan stay under the condition that all roommates agree not to date him, herself included, to prevent any academic distractions or further friction in the house.

Amelie and Stefan start studying together when she discovers he’s an anatomy genius and the key to success in the hard class. Through study dates, she starts to realize Stefan’s reckless reputation doesn’t match the science-loving boy cracking under pressure. Leaky pipes, failed grades, and a Thanksgiving to themselves spark feelings, but to protect Amelie’s rebuilt friendships and Stefan’s fresh start, they keep things secret. But everyone knows secrets can’t last in a small town, and when harsh truths are revealed, Amelie faces the biggest test of her life—and it’s not the anatomy final. With her future, friendships, and new relationship on the line, Amelie must figure out if success means staying on the path with a sure outcome or risking everything for a life she truly wants.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I’m interested in what the sub thinks I could do. Mid century and travel appeal to me. As you can see in the photos, I have a lot of little collections such as rocks, seashells driftwood et cetera. Interested in three areas:

1. Furniture ideas. (for reference, I am looking at crate and barrel primarily for a sectional, accent chair and rug. 

2. Ideas for how I could display things. I do have a lot of books and things that I’ve collected, I don’t necessarily have to keep everything. I know less is more, but I am interested in a creative way to display things. Love the mirror above the couch, but I don’t have anything to put there at the moment. Envisioning a gallery wall of vintage prints or framed items evoking a vintage Americana lodge/retro motel vibe. 

3. Paint. I can’t change the floors, but I can paint the walls. I’m renting here, but have been here for five years, and will likely be here for a few more. Thinking of a lighter colour, but maybe having the wall behind the sectional as a statement color. Nothing too crazy, but something interesting. 

In sum, other than some of the collectible items on the shelves, or framed items, not really attached to anything else. It’s drab and needs a refresh. Deployments got in the way, and now that I’m back, I’m ready to change it up. 

Few other details- I’m blocks from the beach in Southern California. Windows face south and west. Don’t want a typical beach house type vibe- but I do love the sea (and used to work on it). Have a deep appreciation for boutique hotels/coffee shops and restaurants that evoke a sense of great space. It’s primarily just me that lives here. My partner splits time elsewhere in the state.

1inwmkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/videogames/comments/1inwmkx/gaming_desktop_vs_ps5_pro/,Gaming Desktop vs PS5 Pro,"I currently have a mid-range gaming desktop and Steam Deck OLED. My PC can run all current games with maxed out settings, achieving 4K/120 FPS no problem. To be honest though, gaming feels clunkier on PC/Deck than on PS5 and Switch. The experience just isn't as streamlined. Besides that, some games just don't seem to run all that well on PC. The best example of this is Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth. Textures on foliage or character models look blurry and muddled, despite tweaking the visual settings found in the game menu. Don't even get me started on the issues with the recent Spider-Man 2 port.

I consider myself a serious gamer, but really I have less and less time for gaming the older I get. I have a few titles that I own regardless, and beyond those, it takes a lot to get me invested into a game: Skyrim, Spyro Reignited, Tetris Effect, Slay the Spire, Coffee Talk, Tunic, Sea of Stars, and Stray. Most often, a game needs to be single-player focused and have an excellent story to get me to buy in (that is why I love PlayStation Studios titles so much). The Steam Deck is a cool device, but the battery is not great and the OS feels clunky at times.

  
All that said, would a PS5 Pro be better for me than a PC? And would the Switch 2 be better for me than the Steam Deck? Right now, the PS5 Pro is $700 while my PC is worth $1700. Money isn't much of an object, but putting $1,000 in my pocket is never a bad thing. For the record, my work is done on a MacBook Air.",0,1739381872.0,videogames,1,0.5,False

I awoke with a start. I felt like I was choking on something. My face hurt like I was just hit. Where am I? I don’t remember a thing. Wait… I don’t remember a thing! Do I have amnesia? I looked around, I was in a living room, and I didn’t seem to be in any immediate danger. What do I remember? Let me start at the basics, my name is Gerald Graham, my job is… um… I live at… um… This isn’t a good start. Where am I anyway, and how did I get here? I’m in a living room, is this my house? If it is this is a nice place. I looked out the window, I was on the second floor of the house.

 

The house had a massive garden surrounded by three-metre-high walls. It seemed to be night, near the window was a grandfather clock, it was eleven past nine. I realised I was holding something; it was a vial of Lacocelex. What is Lacocelex again? I think it’s that new experimental drug meant to lessen some of the symptoms of heart disease, though in overuse it can have the side effect of temporary memory loss. Wait… How the hell do I know all that?

 

I peered into the vial, it was empty. Why would I consume a whole vial of heart disease medicine? Do I have heart disease? I think I would know if I did. To be fair I don’t even know what my job is, if I even have a job. I suppose I should just wait until the effects of the Lacocelex were off. Patients usually regain memory after about an hour. How do I know that!? Okay, I need to remain calm; this is a nice place!

 

A nice cozy modern living room. I guess I could watch television until I figure it out. I sat down on the surprisingly comfortable couch and turned it on. It seems I recorded the recent soccer match to watch. I don’t like soccer that much, so I’ll probably watch something else. Wait… why would I record a soccer match if I don’t like soccer? Do I like soccer? I should watch it in case I do. I started watching the match, which team do I support again? I suppose I’ll remember in due time.

 

I watched the game for a few minutes, not particularly enjoying myself. Suddenly I heard a loud shattering noise from the bottom floor. Fear shot through me; someone was breaking into my house. Was there a weapon here? How could I defend myself? I grabbed a nearby chair, I suppose it could do. I heard another sound, like a door opening. I cautiously stepped down the stairs equipped with my chair. I walked into the house’s kitchen. I saw a short, masked man looking around the house. I dropped the chair when I saw they had a gun. I froze and raised my hands.

 

“Hey!” I said in shock. They aimed it at my face.

 

“Listen you can take what you want,” I pleaded desperately. The gun started shaking in their hands, they were looking into my eyes.

 

“Take what you want, please,” I begged. They diverted their eyes. If I could remember more of my life, it would probably all flash in front of my eyes now. All I could now recall about my life was my ever-present paralysing fear of death. A fear I knew was always there and now was right in front of me.

 

“Please,” I said finally. They closed their eyes; the gun was wildly shaking. In a single instant, I heard the gunshot, felt a quick stabbing pain in my forehead and saw the smoke emerge from the barrel, a moment later everything went dark. I felt this cold wash over my body, like a freezing shower. Before I could even process the numbing coldness consuming my body, I awoke with a start. Again, I felt like I was choking on something. I looked around, I was again in the living room on the top floor. I grabbed my chest; my heart was pounding. My body no longer felt numb. I felt my forehead, it felt perfectly intact. I swear just a moment ago I felt the bullet pierce my skin.

 

I stood up, it had to be a vivid dream, right? I looked around, everything looked the same as it did in my ‘dream’. If I was dreaming, I should remember everything now, right? No… I still don’t remember a thing, just my name, that’s all. The paradox of what happened overwhelmed me, I couldn’t’ve been shot, else why would I still be alive now? Yet I can’t shake how vivid it all was. I can practically still hear the shot, feel the pain and sense that numbness. I saw the same grandfather clock from earlier. It read eleven past nine, just like in my dream. It had to be a dream; it had to be. I once again sat on the couch. I switched on the TV again, like the last time I saw the soccer game I had recorded.

 

While I still don’t remember much about soccer, I know that this game was the same as it was in my dream. While I slowly began noticing all the similarities between this game and the one in my dream, anxiety slowly built up inside of me, the type of anxiety that I imagine someone would experience if they encountered a ghost or any other paranormal experience. Had I peered into the future? No! That’s ridiculous! I’m a man of logic, not superstition! Yet logic cannot explain how vivid that dream was, and why everything is the exact same as it was in the dream.

 

I heard a noise downstairs, the same one as earlier. Whether what I experienced was a dream, or precognition or whatever, I should’ve heeded its warning. I stood up to run. When I reached the stairs, I saw the masked robber waiting for me at the bottom. I turned to run. Seeing no better option now I suppose my best option is to escape from the window. When I reached the window, I looked back to see the robber walking towards me, eyes closed and gun shaking wildly. I closed my eyes in turn. What would my last thought be? Regret, probably regret.

 

I heard the gunshot, felt the flash of pain and once again felt cold envelope me. I awoke with a start. I immediately stood up and walked to the grandfather clock, like the last two times it displayed eleven past nine. I took a deep breath, I had just had two ultra-realistic experiences of death, too realistic to chalk up to dreaming. I must face the possibility that I was in some kind of a time loop. If that’s true then that means that there is a robber on his way, and I must get out of here now. I set off downstairs. The last time I was here I didn’t even realise it was the kitchen and dining room. Next to the dining room table was a large whiteboard I also hadn’t noticed.

 

The whiteboard had some kind of technical drawing on it. There was a large circle barely enveloping a ring of evenly spaced smaller circles. There was also a horizontal line protruding from the bottom of the large circle. The large circle was labelled “2” with the smaller ones being labelled “1”. Was this something I was working on before I lost my memory? I had no clue what it could be. Below the whiteboard was a strange electronic ball, I picked it up. It seemed to be homemade and very cobbled together. It had a green light attached to it as well as three buttons labelled “1”, “2” and “X”. Again, I had no clue what this was. I realised that there was still a robber on their way.

 

I tried to open the front door, though it was locked. Where are the keys? I went to the kitchen to look for them. I have no clue where they could be. While checking one of the countertops I accidentally knocked over a coffee mug which was there. I don’t have time to clean that up now. I stopped searching for a moment. I know that a dangerous robber is going to break into the house at any moment. I can’t waste my time searching for the keys. I must get out of here now. I saw that there was a massive window next to the kitchen, I picked up a nearby chair and threw it through the window.

 

I hoped through, accidentally cutting my leg on the broken glass while I did. It hurt a lot. I limped around the house searching for my car. Do I even own a car? If I do where are the keys? I saw my car parked near the front door. Suddenly I saw the gate open and a car drive through. That had to be them. I ran away, swallowing the immense pain in my leg. I tripped and fell into the grass. I heard the car stop and the door open. Along with the visceral fear of knowing an armed man was approaching, I also felt this indescribable… hope. I have no clue how my current situation can elicit hope but, that’s how I feel. I heard a gun load.

 

“Not this time…” I barely heard the criminal whisper. I heard the gunshot, felt the pain, felt the cold and as always awoke with a start. As someone who has died thrice already, I can tell you that the feeling isn’t good. A part of me however did feel relieved that I awoke again. I walked downstairs. I saw the window and coffee mug both as they were before I smashed them. There is no dispute that I’m in a time loop, one that resets at my death and one that’s only constant is my consciousness. I thought of the bullet which had pierced my brain several times before. Whatever mechanism reconstructs everything each time the loop resets must also reset the Lacocelex in my brain. This means I can only remember anything if I manage to survive long enough to have its effects wear off.

 

I broke the window again, this time making sure not to cut my leg again on my way out. I looked at the walls surrounding the house. Could I climb over them? I also noticed the large main gate. If I could just find the keys, I could exit through there! I noticed a tall tree near the wall. I’m going to try to climb it and jump over the wall. Only once I reached the top of the tree did I realise that there was a wall-top electric fence covering the whole perimeter. I must value security huh?

 

Thinking of the encroaching criminal made me realise that I had to make a choice now. Thinking of no better option I leapt from the tree. The moment I hit the fence a shocking pain covered my entire body. I let go and fell backwards, still reeling from the pain while I fell. When I hit the ground, the pain disappeared and was replaced by the cold numbness. I awoke with a start. I stood up and kicked a nearby table angrily. An empty glass bottle which stood on the table fell to the ground and shattered. Why can’t I remember a thing? Why of all times must a robber break in now? Why can’t I find the damn key? And why oh why am I trapped in this time loop!?

 

My house was beginning to feel more and more like a prison with each successive loop. Wait… prison… police… I should just call the police! I felt my phone in my pocket and took it out. I dialled the emergency services.

 

“911 what’s your emergency?” the voice on the other end asked.

 

“This may sound strange, but I think my house is about to be broken into,” I said.

 

“What is your current location?”  
  
That would just be my house address, wait…

 

“Hold on…” I said.

 

I went into my phone’s map app. No Wi-Fi. Strange but I just turned my data on. When I finally found my address, I just read it to them.

 

“All right sir we should have someone there in about ten minutes,” they said. I looked at the clock, it was a quarter past nine, and the robber was going to be here in about five minutes.

 

“That’s just great,” I said before angrily hanging up. Now what? I looked out the window at the main gate. If the robber arriving is inevitable, and they’re repeatedly going to come through the gate, can’t I just run out the gate when they get here? I went downstairs and broke open the window. While I walked to the gate, I thought about how alone I currently was. It’s late at night and from the map, I could tell I live in a remote location. I’m the only one trapped in this loop as far as I can tell, and I don’t even have my memories to keep me company. A disturbing thought crossed my mind, if my consciousness is the only constant through the loop then wouldn’t that mean that all the other people are forced to do the same thing repeatedly?  
  
The only one who could change their actions is the robber since they interact with me, but they wouldn’t even realise that. What about all the people who are forced to relive the last ten minutes over and over without even realising? The gate opened. I ran out past the car. The car stopped and quickly reversed. Suddenly it swerved to the side hitting me from behind. The sheer momentum knocked me to the ground. I knew I was about to pass out, if not worse. I faintly heard a car door open before being consumed by cold and waking with a start.

 

Was the car hitting me from behind really enough to kill me? Maybe I just passed out and the robber did the rest? What else could I do? The first time around I froze, then I fled, now let me try to fight. I went to the kitchen. I found two kitchen knives. I decided to keep looking for the gate’s keys. When I heard the gate open in the distance I grabbed the two knives.

 

When they opened the door, I charged at them. Before I could reach them, they promptly gunned me down. The last thing I saw was their shocked expression. After I woke up again, I started laughing. I guess that old saying about a knife and a gunfight is true. What do I do now? I don’t have to rush to do anything. It’s strangely reassuring to know that no matter what happens to me I’ll wake up again. I suppose I could relax a little before trying to do anything else. My biggest priorities are still to escape this house and to figure out how I ended up in this loop, but I don’t have to rush.

 

Wait… why do I feel like this? Shouldn’t being trapped in a house destined to always be robbed be a terrifying scenario? Why am I not that scared anymore? I suppose the loop gives me certainty. At the start, it was scary and frustrating, but I guess the certainty of what comes next, and the certainty of my waking up again takes away the pressure. If a task is something important but not urgent then it ceases to induce stress.

 

I noticed something strange next to the table in the room. A glass bottle was on the floor shattered with its top in pieces, but the bottom was still intact. I remembered with horror how I had kicked this table two loops back in frustration. For some reason, this bottle remained constant throughout the loops resetting. Why could that be? I don’t even know why there is a loop in the first place, so there can’t be any way for me to figure out what’s special about this bottle.

 

If this bottle is a constant what else could be? The mug I smashed downstairs in a similar fashion reset, same with the window as well. The robber must also reset, since if he could remember previous loops why does he keep trying to kill me? I looked at the grandfather clock, it read twelve past nine, clearly the entire dimension of time resets as well. Hell, even my body and brain reset, no matter what fatal injury I experience I still wake up fully healthy each time. Even when I’m shot in the head my brain resets.

 

I stared down at the broken bottle in my hand. Something was special about it and my consciousness. Something that allows both of us to remain constant through this strange anomaly. I dropped the bottle. It smashed into even more pieces on the floor. I walked downstairs to the kitchen; I had to clear my mind. I realised that I was quite hungry, not hungry enough to eat any of the previous loops but still hungry. I opened the fridge to see a closed bag of chocolate muffins. I tried one of them… it was delicious! It had this amazing peanut butter in the centre. I immediately began eating the other muffins.

 

I was delighted that I would still be able to eat more of these muffins since they would presumably reset with the loop. I sat down on one of the chairs to wait for the robber. Strangely, I was waiting for this dangerous criminal about as casually as I would for a doctor or dentist. Huh, both my examples of waiting are medical. Weird.

 

I felt an itch in my neck. I coughed to try to relieve the itch. I realised that it was beginning to get difficult to breathe. I hadn’t been like this on the previous loops. What changed? I realised that there was only one thing it could be. The muffins. I began desperately searching for my Epinephrine injector, which I must have somewhere. As my breathing continued to become more and more difficult, the unpleasant feeling became more and more familiar.

 

I suppose it makes sense why this feeling is familiar. It’s just frustrating that I didn’t remember that I had this allergy in the first place. Why does this horrible feeling feel familiar, but my house doesn’t? I suppose the allergy has been with me longer. I ran into the bathroom, desperate just to find anything to make the reaction go away. With every passing second, I became more desperate while it was also becoming increasingly difficult to quell that desperation with it becoming more and more difficult to breathe.

 

I heard the front door open; I suppose this was one way of stopping the reaction. I walked out of the bathroom; I saw the now familiar robber aiming the trembling gun at me. As the cold enveloped me the itching in my neck vanished. I awoke with a start feeling relieved that it was over. Unfortunately, I can’t eat those delicious muffins (or any other product with peanuts in them) again. Well, I can still eat them if I get a real craving, death is after all just an inconvenience now.

 

I saw the bottle from earlier smashed into many more pieces, just like it was in the previous loop. This simple bottle might be essential to figuring out how I got into this situation, yet I don’t even have the beginning of a plan of how to unravel its secrets. What do I do now? I felt this stress to escape up until now but now I feel this… apathy? Perhaps that’s not the right word. The consistency of my continual renewal each time I ‘die’ has given me faith that I will continue evading death. I think I should relax for a moment. I have no rush after all. What other food is there downstairs? I’m hungry after all those muffins disappeared from my stomach.

 

I found a packet of two-minute noodles in the cupboard. After making them in the microwave, I sat on the couch opposite the front door. There was no point in hiding from my opponent. The noodles were delicious! When the robber walked through the door, I greedily took another bite before the bowl exploded in my hands. When I awoke, I smiled. I knew that I could just make myself the same packet again. However, the happiness of being able to eat the noodles again was being eclipsed by something else.

 

I felt this creeping feeling build inside of me, something I might’ve subconsciously felt during the last loop but ignored. I couldn’t quite place my finger on what it was, but I knew that I couldn’t relax, I had to escape this damn house. I ran downstairs and stood beside the door with my back to the wall to ensure he didn’t see me. I waited for the robber to arrive for a couple of tense minutes. When the door opened, I whipped around and punched him in the face, in response he promptly shot me in the chest. When I awoke again, I knew what to do.

 

I ran downstairs again and once again waited against the wall. When the door opened, I whipped around and first grabbed the gun then punched him in the face. We struggled for the gun, with him pushing me backwards back into the house. He headbutted me and I lost my grip on the gun. Before I could even regain control over the situation I had awoken on the floor on the top floor of the house.

 

I ran back downstairs and did everything exactly the same as I did last time. Except when he tried to headbutt me I dodged it and retaliated with a headbutt of my own. The gun went flying. I released his hand and looked around wildly for where it had landed. I heard it land behind me. When I turned around, I saw the robber bending down to pick it up. He quickly shot me, and I awoke again. No matter how many times I die the feeling of suffocating cold numbness enveloping me never gets any better.

 

Once again, I did everything exactly the same as my previous attempt except this time when I headbutted him I held out my hand to where I knew the gun would land. When I grabbed it, he ran towards me and quickly ripped it from my grasp. After he shot me, I awoke more frustrated than ever. I walked over to a mirror nearby and stared into it. Inside I saw a very familiar-looking man, I man whom I knew the name of, but little else.

 

A man whom I was trying to free, but I was failing. I thought of the creeping feeling I felt each time I was waiting for the robber to arrive. What is this feeling? Maybe… maybe I’m… Maybe I’m beginning to suspect that escape is impossible. Perhaps I’m forever doomed to try in vain to escape this house, only to fail forever. While this certainly is a disturbing thought, I don’t know if it properly explains my current mood.

 

An even more disturbing thought crossed my mind, one that I don’t think I dared to put into words, even in my mind, up until now. Perhaps… I don’t want to escape. Perhaps I don’t want to break the loop. I thought back to the very first time the robber broke into this house, and the paralysing, all-consuming fear which devoured me. I know that for almost my entire life, I had been bone-rattlingly afraid of death.

 

It was never really the physical pain of death which scared me. Sure, getting eaten by a shark or burning alive all sound unpleasant but what always unsettled me about the reaper was the permanence of it all. The pain I can deal with, but the idea of not existing anymore, forever, is indescribably terrifying for me. Now inside of this loop, I’m surrounded by death, since I die about every ten minutes, but I’m shielded from that permanence. Come to think of it, I’ve felt like I’ve always been surrounded by death during my regular life, this time however it’s my own death. Once again, I’m struggling to remember who I even am beyond the barest basics. The difference between death within and without the loop is that here, death isn’t permanent.

 

I again stared at the man in the mirror, the man contemplating whether or not to live inside of a time loop to escape permanent death. Even if I can’t decide what I want to do, I think I should at least try to escape, to give myself the choice. I mean, a prisoner in jail has no choice, while an escaped prisoner can choose to go back. Now what can I do differently in this loop?

 

Perhaps I set some sort of trap, right after I grabbed the gun, he runs towards me. Perhaps I could put something on the ground to ensure that that doesn’t happen. I ran downstairs. After looking through the cupboard I found some tape and a kitchen knife. I taped the kitchen knife on the spot on the ground in front of where I guessed he was going to start running. I waited next to the door like I had all the previous times.

 

I did everything the same as I did last time. Grab. Punch. Dodge. Headbutt. Catch. When he tried to run towards me, he noticed the knife and the ground and stopped. I triumphantly aimed the gun at him.

 

“Checkmate!” I shouted

 

“Wow, you must’ve been through the loop many times,” the robber said, removing his mask. He seemed more intrigued than scared.

 

“What!? You know about the time loop!?” I said incredulously.

 

“You look familiar, have we met before?” he asked.

 

“What do you know about the time loop!?” I demanded.

  
“Quite a lot I would say, after all, I did invent the device which generates it.”

 

“Are you serious?”

 

“Yes,” he said walking over to the whiteboard before picking up the mechanical ball which lay at its foot, “This device is what starts the time loops, resets the time loops, and decides what’s on what layer of the loop a particular object is,” he explained.

 

“And you invented that?”

 

“Yeah, I just said I did.”  
  
“What do you mean ‘layer of the loop’?”

 

He pointed at the small ring of circles on the diagram on the whiteboard, “These small circles represent layer one of the loops. Everything on layer one resets with the trigger event, which in this case I would assume to be…”  
  
“My death,” I said.

 

“Everything on layer two remains constant between the layer one loops resetting.”  
  
“So my body is on layer one and my consciousness on layer two?”

 

“Correct.”

 

“There’s a bottle upstairs which remains smashed even after I die.”  
  
“Then that bottle would be on layer two.”  
  
“Wait, why did you break into my house, and why is your invention here?” I demanded  
  
“What do you mean ‘my house’? This isn’t your house.”  
  
“Yes, it…” Wait… When I woke up, I just assumed that this had to be my house, but I had no proof that it was. “Whose house is it then?”  
  
“James’s, he’s a colleague of mine.”  
  
“Why are you breaking into his house?”  
  
“He stole my invention, and stole that whiteboard, I came here to try to steal them back.”

 

“Why would you kill me in the previous loops?”

 

“I suppose maybe I thought you were just his partner or co-conspirator.”

 

I couldn’t believe it; he’d kill me over that? I’ll push past it and try to find out more.

 

“Do you have any idea how I might’ve ended up in this situation?” I asked, “I just wake up each time with no memory of what happened before the loop started with a vial of heart disease medication.”

 

“I’m sorry, I honestly have no clue,” he replied, “Maybe we could figure it out together.”

 

Before I could scoff at what he was proposing he took a step forward and accidentally stepped on the upright knife. He howled in pain, falling to the floor.

 

“Reset the loop!” he shouted. I looked uncomfortably at the gun in my hands, there was only one way I could reset the loop. He seemed to notice what I was considering.

 

“Not like that!” he shouted, “Take the device and press the button with the one on it!” I picked up the cobbled-together ball.

 

“Wait,” he said, “My name is Rick, my favourite colour is green, and my childhood dog’s name was Lenny.”

 

“What?”

 

“Tell that to me next time you see me, so that I know we had this conversation.”

 

I pressed the button. The moment the button reached its lowest point I felt the usual cold envelope me before I awoke on the ground as usual. I did every single thing exactly the same as I did last time. When I aimed the gun at him, I cut off what he was about to say.

 

“Your name is Rick, your favourite colour is green, and your childhood dog’s name was Lenny,” I stated.

 

“Wow, what happened during the last loop?” Rick asked. I quickly caught him up on everything we had spoken about.

 

“So, we were trying to figure out how you ended up in the loop?” he asked.

 

“Yeah,” I said, “And you said I looked familiar, so you might know something about how I got here.”

 

He stared at me, trying his best to place me.

 

“Oh no…” he whispered.

 

“What?” I asked concerned.

 

“You can’t remember a thing about your life? Not one thing?”

 

I nodded.

 

“I’m a doctor,” he said, “I work at the local hospital.”

 

“Why would a doctor invent a time loop machine?” I asked sceptically.

 

“Do you have any idea how much a time loop machine would improve the medical industry? Anyways, I recognise you as a patient from that hospital, while I didn’t take your case, I did look at your file. This may not be easy to hear but… you have heart failure, and according to your file… it’s bad. You have…” he sighed, “A week, maybe two.”

 

I nearly dropped the gun. I thought of the medicine; it was so obvious all along. For all I know, I’m just as much a robber as Rick, I could’ve broken in here to relieve the medical debt I could have. Even if I break the time loop, I will still die, not even in a year, not even in a month. Without realising it I had been at the end of my life the entire time, the life I could remember nothing about, but that was nonetheless nearing its close. Even if I remain within the time loop, what kind of life will that be? Will I just spend a week in a hospital bed, forever?

 

I would do anything to forget what he had just told me, to go back to the ignorance which had graciously befallen me before. I had escaped, since I could of course easily just run away, but at what cost? Even if I leave this house, I will be doomed to return to it, forever. I am a prisoner who had just escaped into a larger, worse prison. I looked down at the spherical device which had both trapped me yet also shielded me from the truth, the truth that my life was now over. I picked it up and observed it.

 

“What would happen if I pressed the ‘2’ button here?” I asked.

 

“You don’t want to do that,” Rick said.

 

“What would happen?” I demanded.

 

“If you press that everything on both layers one and two will reset. That includes your consciousness. That means that if you press that button everything, from the first time you woke up to now, will happen exactly the same way, indefinably.”

 

My hand was hovering above the button. If I press it, I will forget everything, including the fact that I’m dying. If I don’t press it, I spend an uncountable number of weeks rotting away in a hospital bed until I probably choose to stop the loop and end it all. If I press it, I will at least have the illusion of a life to escape to, a mirage to keep me moving forward. I can either know my fate forever or forever be free of its burden. I made my choice. I could see Rick realised what I was about to do.

 

“NOOO!” he shouted while lunging forward, it was too late. I pressed the button. I felt the cold not only numb my body but also begin to wash away my memories, I surrendered to its freezing tranquillity.

 

I awoke with a start. I felt like I was choking on something. My face hurt like I was just hit. Where am I? I don’t remember a thing. Wait… I don’t remember a thing! Do I have amnesia? I looked around, I was in a living room, and I didn’t seem to be in any immediate danger. What do I remember? Let me start at the basics, my name is Gerald Graham, my job is… um… I live at… um… This isn’t a good start. Where am I anyway, and how did I get here? I’m in a living room, is this my house? If it is this is a nice place. I looked out the window, I was on the second floor of the house.

 

The house had a massive garden surrounded by three-metre-high walls. It seemed to be night, near the window was a grandfather clock, it was eleven past nine. I realised I was holding something; it was a vial of Lacocelex. What is Lacocelex again? I think it’s that new experimental drug meant to lessen some of the symptoms of heart disease, though in overuse it can have the side effect of temporary memory loss. Wait… How the hell do I know all that?

 

\--

 

Rick pulled into his parking space outside his house. He checked the time; it was one past nine. Rick was on a call.

 

“The last week has been rough,” he said, “I still can’t believe she’s gone. There is still so much I would’ve wanted to say to her.”  
  


He entered his home, “And guess what my boss told me today?” he said holding back tears, “Apparently, I took too much time off work to grieve. I’m fired, and I don’t think any other engineering firm would hire me… Yeah, I know that, it’s just I can’t afford a lawyer. I can’t even afford this house anymore, all our savings… well all my savings were spent on her medical expenses. I’m going to have to move. A month ago, I had a wife, I had a job, I had a house, I had a life!” he broke down crying.

 

“Thank you… Thank you… that means a lot…” Rick said to the person on the other end. He stared at the time loop device, “Unfortunately I can’t do that, I thought it was too risky to put her in a time loop, and now I’ll always regret that…”

 

He walked to his kitchen, taking out a mug to make himself coffee, “I know… I know…” he said, “I know I shouldn’t blame myself, but you know who I do blame!? That damn doctor! Dr. Gerald Graham! If he had noticed that she had heart failure earlier, she would’ve never died and I’d be pouring her a glass to drink right now… Yeah! It was his incompetence which ended her life… No, I already spoke with the police, they say that there is nothing I can do, but if you ask me that guy deserves to be thrown in jail! He ruined my life!”

 

Rick heard another call, “Hold on I’ll call you back, I’m getting another call.” He switched to the other call, “Hello, who is this?”

 

“Hey, it’s Dr. Graham. I came here to… apologise. I’m at your gate right now, please open it for me,” the voice on the other end said. Rick immediately grabbed his keys and pressed the button to open the gate. He watched out his window as he saw the car approach. Instinct taking over, Rick waited in front of the front door. When he heard the knock on the door, he immediately opened the door and punched Gerald in the face. Gerald fell to the ground. Rick stared down at his body, in shock at what he had just done.

 

He dragged Gerald inside. What should he do now? Could he blame some sort of crime on Gerald? The prospect of getting him locked up was appealing but he didn’t fancy his chances as an unemployed person vs a wealthy doctor. Rick remembered the gun he kept on his nightstand for self-defence, he shuddered, if there was one thing he would not do now, it was use that. The idea of permanently ending another’s life made him want to vomit. He looked down at Gerland in disgust, Gerald was the killer, not him.

 

Although, that gave him an idea. Perhaps he shouldn’t *permanently* end his life. He picked up the time loop device. He shined the green light it produced into Gerald’s eye. Gerald began regaining consciousness.

 

“What… who…” Gerald whispered. Rick pressed the button labelled ‘X’ on the spherical device. Gerald began horribly shaking, a moment later the light turned blue, and he stopped shaking, having passed out again. The device had just linked to his consciousness, ensuring that whenever it reset time the consciousness would remain constant until the second layer loop is reset. Rick dragged Gerald up the steps by the wrist, carrying the device in his other hand. It might be better to have him wake up on the top floor.

 

Rick noticed the vail of Lacocelex on his table, it was the medication his wife was taking near the end. He could remember how she would have temporary memory loss whenever she took it, it broke his heart that she would constantly forget who he was, before remembering once its effects wore off.

 

“You’ll spend an eternity not even knowing who you are,” Rick said, grabbing the Lacocelex and shoving a handful of its contents down Gerald’s throat. “The police won't trap you in jail, so I’m going to trap you in my prison of time. I may have to shoot you a couple of times, but you’ll be okay, you’ll wake up again.”  
  
Rick shuddered at the thought of having to shoot Gerald, he’d have to get it into his mind that what he was doing wouldn’t be permanent. “As the loops progress, you’ll probably get smart, you might even figure out what I’ve done to you. In that case, once I’ve felt like you’ve experienced enough loops, I’ll hit the ‘2’ button, and then everything will happen again, forever.”

 

A gleeful thought crossed Rick’s mind, he picked up Gerald’s hand and placed it on the device’s button labelled ‘2’. He pressed down. The device’s light flickered, and from now on all the loops would reset from this point, but since the only constant was Gerald’s consciousness and since he was still passed out, no change would occur between the loops until Gerald awoke.

 

“I think it would be great if you choose to press the button,” Rick said smiling, “I’ll have to figure out how to convince you to do that, but I think I can do it.” The idea that Gerald might willingly choose to trap himself made Rick’s revenge all the sweeter.

 

“Goodbye,” Rick said, “See you soon.” He put the gun from his nightstand into his pocket. He walked down the stairs, leaving the device at the foot of the whiteboard. He climbed into his car and drove away, pondering what would proceed. He parked just outside his gate. What was going to be just a couple of minutes wait for him, was going to be an eternity’s worth of punishment for Gerald. As the clock struck eleven past nine, on the second floor of the house which Rick had made their prison, Gerald awoke with a start...",1,1739381868.0,shortstoryclub,0,1.0,False

(This is gonna be short cuz I don't got time AND i deleted the entire reason of his abilities essay, now I am too drained for writing all that)

AND DO NOTE THAT I AM STILL DUMB FOR THIS, too tired.. But yeah.

After a long while, he has evolved and turned more.. Chaotic, his bond with Orkon grew a little stronger giving him access to more of his abilities, BUT at the cost of his sanity, which is slowly getting far more worse.

Also the whole point of his respirator is to hide his monstrous teeth and because his breath smells so bad.. since he keeps eating any kind of meat or flesh related food both rotten or not.

with his abilities and uh perks are;

\- Marked For The Hunt: ""Just YOU and ME! AND NOBODY ELSE!""  
With his monster eye, he will mainly focus on one target, being able to know where they are and their emotion, by their scent and sounds that they make, the bigger the chances of them being marked by his vision, of course he needs to see them first before he could lock on.

\- Bleeding Binds: ""You are not going anywhere just yet.""  
He can't fully manipulate blood itself, but he can use his own blood to create bloody chains to either latch on to swing across areas, drag himself to one place to another, grab something in a distance, OR latch on a person to drag them close to him, or to drag him close towards them, and he's quite creative with these binds of his.

\- Phantom Slash: ""Block this!""  
With his blade, he can throw in some blood slashes on your way, it might be fast, but it can be shrugged aside with a good amount of armor.

\- I HAVE A GUN: ""Now dodge this one!""  
An advanced revolver that does pack a punch, speed, and is also a fast reloader, but it is not recommended for sniping, since the bullet drop for it is quite crazy.

\- Devour: ""No one's gonna remember you anyway.""  
He can eat and take a chunk of a corpse's flesh to fuel himself with blood and give himself a boost or heal a few wounds, simple, though he will forever be hungry.

\- Appetite Of Many: ""Food is food, and I'm hungry.""  
Fully immune to food poisoning and isn't afraid to eat anything as long as it has meat and flesh and bits of blood, he'll eat it, unless there's a bomb in it then yes it will kill him, I pretty much gave him this cuz I want him to have a reason to always be in awe by ACTUAL good food.

\- Loss of Sanity: ""Why is why.""  
Every time he uses his blood abilities he losses sanity too, but this makes him also pretty unpredictable.

\- Rage: ""ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS JUST DIE!""  
Becomes pretty predictable but increases his speed and power, and eternal hatred.

When it comes to hidden perks, he doesn't need sleep, all he needs is just a good chunk of meat and he can stay awake for a good amount of time, since his body changed to it ever since Orkon changed his body a bit, he prefers to handle things with brute force since he believes it's more efficient, trusting more in his fast pace instincts that thinking, act now think later, and he also gambled before so he has semi decent experience with a bunch of poker games (Not that he's going to win.) And also he is usually quiet, speaking with his thoughts whenever he is off duty.

His hobby is being a great barista, and making art out of coffee, since William Nychov's family has a coffee shop and well ever since he died he did wanted to help, so he became one of their baristas, eventually finding out that he has passion.. in cafe lattes.

Note that he has a weakness, the moment his heart is hit, shot, smacked, or slashed, it will disable all his abilities in an instant, and not to mention whenever he hits a hunger spike, he usually becomes more aggressive, and out of control.

and lastly do note that I was too tired, and I just took a cup of coffee and convinced myself just to put this out because I wanna post something but I am too drained to think so yeah, brain fart.",3,1739381847.0,RobloxAvatars,2,1.0,False

I (21F) met a guy (25) on a dating app. I have been on four dates with him. So far, the dates have been like this:

-We've done coffee date, lunch date, park date and movie date.

-I'm shy and I sometimes can't keep convo going. But the other times, he tells jokes, and I play along with him, and we laugh at each other.

-He said he wants to keep seeing me and likes me a lot on the third date

-After the third date, he texts more slowly and his responses feel a bit colder than before (he sometimes texts back with only stickers now)

-We haven't kissed yet. He doesn't really initiate physical touch. We once touched each other playfully on the fourth date while joking. 


I want to make out or have sex with him, and I'm thinking of inviting him over (he's living in a shared house and I think it's best to invite him over from myself)


Do you think I would freak him out if I ask him to come over at this point? Should I wait a little longer before inviting him over? I'm worried about him texting slowly lately and us not having kissed yet.",2,1739381699.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

He started to pull away and say he was “too busy with work” 2 months prior to that and finally said he lost feelings and that we should break up. 
I was never interested in tarot or any other esoteric things but ever since we broke up i started getting these stupid videos of tarot readers on tiktok saying he misses me and will come back to me. So I couldn’t resist but purchased readings from 3 different tarot girls, with about 3 weeks between each. Only one of them (right after the breakup) said that he is sorry and that “our story is not finished yet”, but two others said that there is no chance for us to reconcile. Last one even said that his self esteem got up since he dumped me and that he’s already sleeping around with other girls :))))
I thought that hearing something like that will make me get over him, since he doesn’t care why would I do? But hearing it made me so much worse even though I don’t really believe in it. 
I did not spend much on these readings, to be fair they were quite cheap, not much more than I would spend on a coffee a cake in a cafe. And i strongly encourage you guys not to spend what you can’t afford on these kinds of things. But I still feel embarrassed that I did it, like I would never tell my friends I did something like that.

His ward, Isabeau Finne, was different. It was almost as if she could sense him near her, making his job as her Scáthanna a little more problematic than the norm. Perhaps it was her upbringing, coupled with her lineage, which was the cause of this disconnected cognizance — her mother had been an O’Cailleach, one in a long line of Scottish-Celtic witches. This gifted Isabeau with innate talents she was only on the cusp of discovering were much more than she’d ever been made aware of.

It had scarcely been a year since he was appointed as her guard. He’d been called into action after his predecessor had mysteriously abandoned his post — and become one of the Missing.

Now he found himself on a plane heading to New Orleans. No one on the midnight flight out of LAX that October evening noticed the brutally handsome man sitting three rows behind the amber-haired beauty who was his charge. Manipulating perception was one of his kinds many advantages over humans. Another was never needing to make a reservation for travel. He could merely slip to the Vahel — a place in between the here and the there — and move freely and invisibly among them.

Sliding the crumpled and overly browsed inflight magazine back into its snug seat-back pocket, he watched as Isabeau gathered her costuming paraphernalia together. She carefully stashed away her midair couture shop into a leather bag before rising from her seat to stow it in the overhead compartment. For nearly half of the flight, she’d been embroidering minuscule silk threads and ribbons into an array of fall leaves across the front of a gown. It was a creation specifically designed to wear to the costume ball she was traveling towards.

The elaborate dress remained draped over her, a makeshift blanket on the increasingly chilly flight, too precious to risk being damaged in the overhead bin. It was her first journey to New Orleans, and with all the excitement and anticipation she was feeling, he was doubtful she would have found rest if it had not been for exhaustion finally taking over.

He watched as she fell asleep against her boyfriend’s shoulder, curling her legs up under her as well as she could in the coach seat. She snuggled her pale cheek into the age-softened collar of his distressed black leather coat, with a content smile edging her lips.

She was resting now, which gave him an excellent opportunity to catch a few desired winks of his own. Pulling an under-sized airline blanket over his body, he found himself wishing he would have grabbed two on his way down the aisle before takeoff. He stuffed a tiny white pillow between his head and the window, then stretched his long legs across the other two conveniently empty seats. The flight was not fully booked, freeing up the entire row to relax his formidable physique across.

\*\*\*

THE PILOT ANNOUNCING their descent to the New Orleans International Airport interrupted the slumber of the plane’s passengers. Waking, the Shadow stretched his arms overhead, the muscles protesting from his nap in such cramped quarters. He watched as Isabeau mirrored his movements, her head tilting from left to right to work out the aches she’d also acquired. In search of her makeup, she rummaged through her bag until she found a travel pouch. He watched as she freshened up, applying a touch of makeup before popping a mint into her mouth. Following her lead, he reached into his coat pocket and withdrew his own tin of curiously strong mints, then took a swig of water from the bottle the flight attendant had given him five hours before.

\*\*\*

THE SCÁTHANNA WATCHED as Isabeau perched on the edge of the fountain that was the centerpiece of their French Quarter hotel’s brick courtyard. Clear waterspouts burbled from the mouths of four statuary frogs into the pool sitting beneath their cement amphibian feet. She was cooing at a family of turtles, attempting to coerce them to the surface with a piece of croissant left over from her breakfast. He sat on the other side of the courtyard at a verdigris café set, his presence casually hidden behind a newspaper and his intrinsic talent to mask. Waiting.

It was her first night in the Quarter, and he’d decided that with the immense number of revelers on the streets, there would be no need to hide behind the deceptions of his kind, other than a simple manipulation to disguise his true face.

With his hands buried deep within the pockets of his long wool coat, he discreetly trailed behind Isabeau and her group of friends as they departed from the courtyard. Expertly blending into the crowd, he positioned himself a few bodies behind her, as they made their way through the fog enshrouded streets. They strolled in merriment along Esplanade Avenue, crossing over to Royal, and continued their journey down Ursulines and then Chartres.

With every step of their route, Isabeau’s eyes were full of wonder. Beautiful and captivating objects in shop windows invited her consideration one after another. She stared up at the delicate and ornate, awe-inspiring architecture of the city. She marveled at the allied feeling of the people around her upon entering Jackson Square. Kindred spirits all gathering in this amazing city for the same event. All of them traversing through the magical night as thick mist rolled in off the river to lend an even more dream-like ambiance to the experience.

The Scáthanna found himself completely enchanted by her. He watched as she drew her first breath of the magic-tinged atmosphere of the French Quarter. Her eyes grew wide and her smile enormous with each step deeper into the city she’d dreamed of visiting for ten years.

Moisture clung to the exposed skin of his face, settled into his dark hair, further enhancing his features. He raked his fingers through his damp and slightly unruly locks, pushing them back from his face. He tugged his collar up higher to ward off a chill. The humidity of the day had abandoned them, and fall was officially taking its place.

The full moon cast misty images of the people wandering through the night against the fog, turning them into shadow puppets in a play. They walked unaware of what wandered the streets among them, possibly hunting them. Not Isabeau. His Isabeau would be safe.

He could feel her heart soaring. She beamed as she oohed and aahed over favored objects in the windows of the closed shops, steering Robert’s attention to any number of things as they passed. Jazz floated through the air along with the lingering and delectable scents of creole cuisine. She was giddy, and Robert got caught up in the lure of her infectious delight. He kissed her and vowed his undying love then and there. The Scáthanna clenched his jaw, with his fists held tightly in his pocket.

An adorable tabby cat sat serenely in the window of a loom shop. Isabeau tapped on the glass and spoke to the feline as he rubbed his furry jowls against the glass, trying to reach her hand to be petted.

Lost in his own beguiled state of mind, her Shadow nearly ran into her. He veered away just before colliding into the couple, narrowly avoiding sending all three of them crashing into the storefront. The startled cat dashed away from the glass and into the depths of the shop. Regaining his normally cool composure, the Scáthanna slid effortlessly away. He remained unseen by Isabeau, but still observed the sweet expressions on her face as she looked into the night sky, breathing in the magic of the city . . . and the love of her young man.

She pulled her attention back to Robert as she slipped her hand into his. Their group peered into a toy store window, all exuberant as children at the old-fashioned toys tucked away inside. Before continuing on their way, they paused to ask a young woman walking by to snap a photo of them. Cat removed the vintage Nikon 35mm from around her neck, handed it carefully to the woman, and briefly showed her how it worked.

They all struck a silly pose in front of the toy store window that was bursting with color and cheerful lighting. Her Shadow couldn’t help but grin widely at Isabeau’s jubilance as she pointed into the window and pulled a goofy face for the camera before bursting into laughter. Onward they went, laughing and carousing down the slate pavement through Jackson Square, past Madeleine’s — where the young women all agreed to gather in the morning for café au lait and pastries — toward Decatur. They waited for a mule-drawn carriage to pass, then crossed the street and entered the mecca that was Café Du Monde.

Isabeau hooked her arm through Robert’s and let him lead her to a vacant table near the railing where they could people-watch and have a front row seat to the trio of jazz musicians taking up roost near the café. A tattered hat was set on the ground in front of their feet collecting tips from many music lovers as they paused to enjoy the impromptu performance.

Her Shadow watched as she had her first sip of café au lait made with chicory and her first taste of a beignet. He was delighted as her face became awash in bliss with the very first bite. She giggled while trying to remove the avalanche of powdered sugar that cascaded down the front of her velvet dress and touched down onto her lap. The white stood out starkly against the black velvet.

He followed as Isabeau wandered away to observe the making of beignets through the large viewing window at the back of the café, and as she first set eyes on the meandering Mississippi. “*Down by the river where it’s warm and green*.” He heard her sing dreamily, a line from a song by Concrete Blonde.

As they walked hand-in-hand along the Moon Walk, Robert pulled her into his arms, twirled her in a circle, bringing forth another bout of her sweet laughter, before whispering in her ear and kissing her.

Her Shadow turned his eyes away. She was a truly enticing creature, and this *boy* could never adequately appreciate her.

He watched as she fell more in love with the city the longer they meandered throughout the Quarter. He stayed with them, with her, to be certain she remained safe on their walk to the hotel. Remaining vigilant until she was safely tucked away in her room, before retiring to his own.

The tumor is large and bleeding. This has caused him constant nausea and caused him to throw up. It has been difficult to eat and when he does eat, he has been throwing up. Several members of his family have died of Stomach Cancer so this is a generational curse, there is an evil altar in the bloodline and I have discovered through conversation their is Witchcraft being waged against him.  He was also a Coffee drinker. The Coffee Bean, Coffee, Organic Coffee, Decaf Coffee and Mushroom Coffee cause Cancer, Heart Attacks, Strokes and destroy the Kidney, Liver, Stomach, Lungs, Thyroid and Heart as the Coffee bean contains 1000 chemicals and is a fertilizer not an edible food.

Greg and his caregiver have been given the 25 Ways Divine Healing Comes including reading Healing Scriptures all day, declaring the Scriptures and meditating on them constantly, all day and night. 

They have also been given a list of Superfoods that have been used traditionally across Earth to beat cancer when utilized with an Edible Plant Whole Food Plant Based Vegan Diet. These superfoods are still used successfully to defeat cancer outside the United States, today. He has also been given the name of the best tube feed Functional Formularies Liquid Hope Peptide Formula (in the silver pouch) which is a Plant Based Tube Feed with 19 Superfoods and is Stevia free that has brought countless people back from being given up to die by Medical Doctors.

I sent them books that document testimonies of people who defeated cancer including Chris Wark's Chris Beat Cancer and Dodie Osten's Healed of Cancer. I shared the recent testimony of a senior citizen fighting cancer who went on a Juice Fast of juiced  fruits, vegetables and other edible plants with vitamins and health supplements only for 153 days and is now cancer free. 

So that the critics of natural health and following Biblical Instructions for Healing are aware Greg is under allopathic western medical care, although Western Pharmaceutical Drug practitioners dont address the cause of cancer including The Standard American Diet, Acidic Foods, Parasites, Toxins, Poisons, Artificial Additives and... Coffee. 

Prayer Points to Pray for Greg every hour on the hour:
1. I rebuke, paralyze and bind the spirit of affliction, infirmity, Witchcraft, premature death, pharmakeia, regular death and the spirit behind cancer; stop your operations and cease your manuevers; leave now and never return in JESUS Mighty Name 

2. I command all Cancer, Tumors and Parasites militating against Greg to die in JESUS Mighty Name. I command all internal bleeding, nausa and pain stop now in the name of JESUS. 

3. FATHER GOD i appeal to the court of Heaven for Greg's Life. Greg wants nothing to do with the evil spirits, idols and altars in his bloodline. Please remove them and may YOUR Annointing break every curse, yoke and evil instrument against him. I request a supernatural restraining order against the evil forces militating against him. Please send your Most Powerful Angel Available to enforce the Restraining Order in JESUS Mighty Name 

4. By The Sacrifice of JESUS, physical Body on The Cross, Greg, will live and not die and declare the works of the LORD in JESUS Mighty Name 

5.Thank YOU, FATHER GOD  By The Stripes on JESUS Back, Greg's Stomach is Healed in JESUS Mighty Name 

6. HOLY SPIRIT, you are welcomed in Greg's Room. Breathe through his lungs, think through his mind in JESUS Name.

7. By The Blood of JESUS, Greg is strong in The LORD and The Power of HIS Might. Gregs stomach, kidney, liver and bodily systems be strengthened by GOD's Glorious Power in JESUS Mighty Name.

8. Greg has a voracious appetite and when he eats, it stays down in JESUS Mighty Name 

9. I loose the Zoe Abundant Life of JESUS CHRIST into Greg's Body and Mind in General and I loose The Virtue Of JESUS CHRIST into his Stomach in particular JESUS Mighty Name. 

10. LORD JESUS CHRIST of Nazareth, please pray for Greg that the bleeding stop, the tumor and all cancer die, Greg's appetite returns and the food is nurturing to his body. Thank YOU, JESUS 


As an Intercessor, make sure you read Psalm chapter 91 and Ephesians 6:10-19 outloud upon waking, before leaving the house and before going to bed at night. Also annoint yourself with oil, in the name of GOD The FATHER, HIS Son, JESUS CHRIST, and The HOLY SPIRIT that JESUS sent; when you awake and before bed. 

Finally, here is a Testimony about a lady who had the same exact Cancer and symptoms who beat it by using Faith in JESUS FInished Work:

How to Style with Floral Jewelry: Enhancing Your Wardrobe with Vibrant Accessories
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Floral jewelry has become a charming way to add a touch of nature to your wardrobe. The beauty of flowers can be captured in stunning accessories, and a colorful daisy flower pendant is a prime example. These vibrant pieces can elevate any outfit, whether you’re heading to a casual brunch or a formal event. Let’s explore some exciting ways to style floral jewelry and make the most out of your favorite accessories.

### Choose the Right Outfit

When styling floral jewelry, the outfit you choose plays a crucial role. Here are some tips to ensure your colorful daisy flower pendant shines:

- **Solid Colors:** Solid-colored tops or dresses make floral jewelry stand out. A white blouse or a black dress allows the vibrant colors of your daisy pendant to take center stage.
- **Denim Delights:** A casual denim jacket paired with a simple t-shirt is the perfect canvas for your floral accessory. The combination gives a relaxed vibe while still looking chic.
- **Layer Up:** If you're wearing multiple layers, such as cardigans or scarves, ensure your daisy pendant rests on top. This technique keeps the accessory visible and adds personality to your attire.

### Accessorize Wisely

Less can be more when it comes to accessorizing with floral jewelry. Here are some strategies to ensure your daisy flower pendant remains the focal point:

- **Complementary Colors:** If you're wearing other jewelry, choose pieces that harmonize with your pendant without overpowering it. For instance, simple gold or silver stud earrings work beautifully.
- **Mix and Match:** You can create a layered look with other necklaces. Choose pieces of varying lengths to add depth while allowing your colorful daisy to remain visible.
- **Statement Pieces:** If your pendant is quite large or intricate, keep other accessories minimal. This approach helps to draw attention to the pendant while maintaining elegance.

### Consider the Occasion

The occasion plays a significant role in how you style your floral jewelry. Here are some scenarios to consider:

- **Casual Outings:** For everyday wear, pair your daisy pendant with a simple t-shirt and jeans. This look is easy-going yet stylish—perfect for running errands or meeting friends for coffee.
- **Office Wear:** At work, wear your pendant over a fitted blouse or under a blazer. This adds a touch of femininity to your professional attire without being overly flashy.
- **Evening Events:** For formal occasions, choose a classy dress that complements the colors of your daisy pendant. Add elegant heels and a classy clutch to complete the look.

### Hair and Makeup Considerations

Your hair and makeup should harmonize with your floral jewelry for a cohesive look. Here’s how to enhance your style:

- **Hairstyle:** An updo or a half-up style can frame your face and highlight your pendant. Loose waves can offer a soft, romantic look that complements the floral design.
- **Makeup Choices:** Keep makeup natural for daytime looks, but don’t hesitate to add a pop of color for evening events. Match your lipstick or nail polish with the colors of your daisy pendant for a unified style.

### Seasonal Styling Tips

Floral jewelry shines in various seasons. Consider these tips based on the time of year:

- **Spring and Summer:** Embrace vibrant fabrics like cotton and linen. Pair your daisy pendant with floral prints for a fresh, summery vibe.
- **Fall and Winter:** Layer your floral jewelry under cozy sweaters or scarves. Earthy tones and dark colors work beautifully with your sunny daisy, providing a lovely contrast.

With these strategies, styling your colorful daisy flower pendant becomes an exciting journey of fashion. By choosing the right outfits, accessorizing wisely, considering occasions, and aligning with seasonal vibes, your floral jewelry can enhance your wardrobe wonderfully. Remember, the key is to enhance your style while allowing your vibrant accessory to stand out. Enjoy the playful and enchanting world of floral fashion!

However, since the coffee fallout, I now feel like he’s intentionally avoiding me at the gym.

The situation initially seemed like a simple and casual coffee meetup. I had shared a few friendly exchanges with him at the gym, and there seemed to be a mutual interest in connecting outside of that space. When he expressed interest in meeting for coffee, I took it as a straightforward and low-pressure plan, not expecting anything beyond a casual conversation. I didn’t perceive it as a date or anything more significant than just enjoying a coffee together and chatting outside the gym.

I made the effort to suggest a time and place, showing initiative and openness. He agreed, which seemed to confirm that he was still interested in following through with the plan. However, when the day arrived, things took an unexpected turn. He canceled at the last minute, citing an excuse that didn’t feel entirely genuine, particularly because of the timing and how little notice he gave me. I had already taken time to get ready, and even cleaned my car because of the snow that morning, which showed that I was committed to the plan. So, when he canceled and didn’t express much concern for the inconvenience, it left me feeling frustrated, disrespected, and unimportant.

At that point, I decided to set a boundary by informing him that I wasn’t interested in rescheduling or making future plans. I wasn’t necessarily angry, but the situation felt like a pattern of lack of consideration and effort on his part, which didn’t sit well with you.

I saw his cancellation as a sign that he wasn’t as invested in following through as I was, even though he’d initiated the coffee meetup both in person and through text before. It made me feel like I had been the one to take on most of the effort in making the plans, while he only followed along passively. This left me questioning his intentions — whether he truly cared to meet up or if he was just offering the idea without any real commitment behind it.

I also began to wonder about his overall interest in me, especially when, after the fallout, he didn’t try to reach out and make things right. His behavior seemed to suggest that he didn’t care enough about the connection to make an effort, which ultimately led you to step away. His lack of accountability and genuine follow-through made me realize that my time and energy were better spent elsewhere, where my efforts would be appreciated.

In summary, I was simply looking for a casual meet-up with someone I thought was friendly, but his actions (or lack thereof) made me feel disrespected and unimportant. I set a boundary by stepping away because I realized that if he truly cared about connecting with you, he would have done more to show it.

TL;DR: I met this man at the gym. I’m left confused with this situation ",0,1739381064.0,relationships,23,0.1,False

It feels like the perfect spot for a cozy cafe, especially with the number of students and faculty around. I’m sure it would be a hit if someone sets up a place there. Just putting the idea out there for any aspiring chayakkada owners.

My drinking has slowly been gradually increasing all my life, I'm the ripe age of 46 now but still 22 in my head, but recently my drinking has been ridiculous.  Finish work 2 or 3 maybe 4 pints in the bar, go upstairs (I live there with 3 other chefs), between 4-6 more tinnies washed down with swigs of vodka.   I knew I had a problem but the booze and it's persuasive voice told me it was ok and I was in control. 😳 
  Rewind to last Wednesday night just finished a bit of a stint at work doing serious amount of covers and pretty stressful yadda yadda so finish work and hit it that little bit harder and then some.  Don't think I had much sleep if any at all, remember ringing a few random about 2 in the afternoon then BOOM!   
  Somehow it's dark, I'm in the pub car park where I work and live and the police are there asking me how I got the damage on the car...not mine my friends car I'm borrowing while he learns to drive.  It was like some sort of weird dream, fuck knows how I got there, fuck knows why I got in the car and decided to drive being absolutely off with the fairies.  So I got arrested chucked in the cell overnight all the time wondering what the actual fuck went on.  I still can't remember a single thing it's a truly terrifying thought knowing you could have wiped out generations of a family just because you were pissed 😔
  Got my court case in a couple of weeks but it's the most sobering thought to ever whack me in the chops!  Every word of advice about my drinking instead of going in one ear and out the other all makes perfect logical sense.  It's a shame it takes something traumatic to wake the fuck up from the booze fuelled fog.   Today marks day 10 without drinking, I have 50 ml of vodka a day but regard that as medicine and will wean myself off that very shortly.  The world is so much clearer, energy levels through the roof, starting to feel a connection with the inner me which has been beaten up into submission from the booze demon, the inner me is a pretty sound bloke, happy, fun, caring and daft as a brush 😎 Struggling to sleep a bit but not really arsed about that the sleep I do get is a lot more nourishing than just passing out drhnk sleep.  My taste buds are bursting with life chocolate biscuits, house music, nice random fruit juices and South American and Vietnamese coffees and making all this easier than I thought.

1inw693,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortfiction/comments/1inw693/intervene/,Intervene,"Oscar Bonaventure opened the door to his apartment to see his entire family waiting for him expectantly.

“Surprise party? Ain’t even my birthday!” Oscar slurred. “did ya’ll bring whiskey? Beer? Nothin?”

He noticed that among his family were two strangers. One was a Catholic priest who seemed to be there just to support Oscar’s daughter, Mary. His hand was on Mary’s shoulder. Oscar thought that was a little weird.

But this other guy. He looked like a doctor. Oscar wasn’t big on doctors. They had been telling him he’d die young his whole life. From the drinking, the smoking, the VD, the coal mining. There was a time during the war that he was unconscious for 48 hours out of a single week. They told him that was bad, but he just tuned them out.

Here he was, seventy-nine and felt like he was forty-six. Still strong, with sinewy muscles and skin like the bark of an oak tree.

He found Martha, his ex wife, with his eyes. “Did you put them up to this, Marth?” Oscar inquired. ”Is this about the drinking?”

“Daddy it is *always* about the drinking!” Kenny lit up. The boy had always been shy, maybe a bit soft.

“Well this time, no one cares anymore. We ain’t here to get you to stop” Kenny continued.

Kenny was the third born. He’d always been a wimpy kid, but even Oscar had to admit that he’d come into his own as a man in the four years since he himself became a father.

“No one is ever gonna get you to stop.” Kenny said, rolling his eyes.

Oscar nodded proudly. He knew Kenny was the smartest of the whole bunch. More brain cells than his other four combined. Kenny understood him.

John stood up. At least five inches taller than either of his brothers, the first born son of Oscar and Martha Bonaventure was like a clone of Oscar - tall, strong, and none too bright.

“Listen dad its about your cat.” John explained.

Oscar didn’t know where this could be going but he was immediately suspicious. Despite all of the ways in which he was like his father, John *did* grow up in this new generation of soft little pussy liberal babies with their interventions, their loser trophies, and whatever nefarious cultural trend that Hollywood was currently cooking up.

“You’re here for Scooter?” Oscar said.

“Yes Oscar. ” Martha implored. “Scooter has special needs. He ain’t gonna do it y’all. I told you this was a waste of time.”

“Is this that retard thing?” Though relieved, Oscar was baffled that the pussy liberal woke ideology had infected his family this way.

They tried to explain to him that the cat has *special needs*. They tried to tell him that his only companion just needs a few *appliances* and *special medications*. They tried to tell him not to say words like “retard”, “pussy”or “cripple”

Oscar knew what it was code for. They had all left him here to die out in this shack. They took everything from him, and now they wanted to take away his cat too.

They began shouting over eachother, each trying to make their own point about the matter.

“Listen here everyone! Scooter ain’t no retard cat!” Oscar shouted cutting through the noise, “Let me say it again for y’all. Scooter! Ain’t! A! Retard! And even if he was, he just an animal, I ain’t gon’ treat him different or nothin’. So take your orthapedic hypnogogic, orthodontic, ergonomic, tempurepedic ayurvedic crap outta my house!”

There was a pause in the crosstalk as Mary began sobbing.

Oscar was not gonna give up ground just because his daughter started crying. For Christ’s sake, she was a grown woman! Oscar had half a mind to slap her like he used to.

“Why you cryin’?” Oscar asked belligerently.

“Because daddy, they gonna take Scooter away!” Mary said as she sobbed.

“What are you talking about?!”Oscar rasped, “What are you...” Oscar trailed off and turned to Kenny, his face grave.

Kenny’s glance at the stranger, the doctor, seemed to say “don’t ask me - ask him”.

Oscar looked at the doctor, who was now the only person who had remained seated during all of this.

“Who is this? What are you talking about?”

The man stood up. With by far the least accented voice in the room, and possibly the least accented voice Oscar had heard in person in the last decade, the doctor said “Hello Oscar my name is Rupert Weinman, and I’m a veterinarian specializing in feline neuro science.”

“Alright sir, well thank you for coming by, but I can assure you, Scooter ain’t a retard.” Oscar said.

“No one is saying that” Rupert said calmly. “Scooter has what we call...”

Oscar wore a look somewhere between anger and apathy. He didn’t interrupt, but he did start to tune the man out. Neuro science? It’s just a made up word. He had some sort of document with a scan on it.

Oscar knew those scans were bullshit, just tests to see if you were ready for brainwashing by George Soros. And that last name, Weinman. Sounded jewish. Definitely a red flag.

At some point, Rupert finished his little speech and said “Do you understand what that means Oscar?”

Oscar hesitated. As Rupert held the document out, Oscar’s family stood in expectant silence.

“Say again?” Oscar asked.

“Scooter has epilepsy Oz. Just like his mama.” Martha calmly explained to Oscar. There were tears in her eyes. Oscar looked around, he saw tears in everyone’s eyes.

Scooter’s mother was a cat named “Mama Wildcat”. She passed away in pain and agony due to Oscar’s lack of understanding.

He saw that now. It dredged up all of the memories from just ten years ago, when he and Martha finally got the divorce. He had thought the cat died of sadness, but now it all finally clicked.

Epilepsy wasn’t some made up pussy liberal thing. Mama wildcat had a rough go, and Oscar had always regretted losing her so young.

Now Scooter was almost twice that age, and he hadn’t shown any symptoms. Oscar swiped the document from the veterinarian’s outstretched hand and began flipping through.

It was almost unintelligible to him. These democrats were good at one thing: making up fancy sounding words.

He flipped to the end. The picture was just an X-ray, he couldnt see what was wrong.

The last page had in simple english “Diagnosis: Feline Epilepsy. Positive: 94%” Oscar wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed but he understood that.

He looked up, tears welling in his eyes. “But there’s something we can do?”

Right when the Veterinarian began to respond, multiple of Oscar’s family members let out loud outbursts of anger mixed with relief.

“Are you fucking kidding me?” Kenny shouted.

“Thirty years we try to get him to stop smoking. One X-ray of the cat and now he’s onboard with modern medicine” Jimmy, Oscar’s youngest, said to no one in particular.

Tabitha and John were snickering to eachother “Maybe if we can get daddy scanned...” “Oh no he’ll never go for that.”

The room filled with laughter for a moment as Doctor Rupert explained the various medicines, and some of the appliances made for helping Cats with Epilepsy. Oscar’s newfound openness has lightened the mood for almost the entire family.

Martha had sat back down in shock. She saw Oscar shaking Rupert’s hand as he said something agreeable. Scooter had nestled up beside her, as he was in the habit of doing whenever she had come by in the last ten years.

She picked Scooter up by his scruff and began walking over to Oscar.

Oscar smiled “There he is, our honorable guest, Scooter. Who is NOT RETARDED!” he said half jokingly.

Oscar looked to Martha’s face. He recognized the expression and was overwhelmed with a sudden alarm. He had only seen it once before. The night she almost killed him. She had something in her hand, underneath Scooter.

As she walked towards him, Oscar backed up defensively. While holding the cat, Martha attempted to slap Oscar, but he caught her hand. She took out a taser from underneath the cat.

As Scooter jumped down, Martha held the taser up. “Now you open your mind?“ Martha shouted as they struggled ”Now you will listen to a doctor?!? You asshole! Forty five years! Forty five years I gave you you ungrateful, son of a,-”

At that moment the taser went off. The shock went through their entangled arms and they dropped to the floor in a pile.

The room froze into stunned silence. Rupert, ever the doctor, quickly bent down to check their pulses. He gravely shook his head.

The siblings hugged and all began to cry as they stood infront of their now-dead parents.

Scooter jumped up onto the coffee table and all of the siblings turned their heads from their dead parents, to the cat. With a completely flat affect, Kenny looked around and said “Ok who’s taking care of him? Not it.”",1,1739380770.0,shortfiction,0,1.0,False

1inw5pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1inw5pl/hm_intervene/,[HM] Intervene,"Oscar Bonaventure opened the door to his apartment to see his entire family waiting for him expectantly.

“Surprise party? Ain’t even my birthday!” Oscar slurred. “did ya’ll bring whiskey? Beer? Nothin?”

He noticed that among his family were two strangers. One was a Catholic priest who seemed to be there just to support Oscar’s daughter, Mary. His hand was on Mary’s shoulder. Oscar thought that was a little weird.

But this other guy. He looked like a doctor. Oscar wasn’t big on doctors. They had been telling him he’d die young his whole life. From the drinking, the smoking, the VD, the coal mining. There was a time during the war that he was unconscious for 48 hours out of a single week. They told him that was bad, but he just tuned them out.

Here he was, seventy-nine and felt like he was forty-six. Still strong, with sinewy muscles and skin like the bark of an oak tree.

He found Martha, his ex wife, with his eyes. “Did you put them up to this, Marth?” Oscar inquired. ”Is this about the drinking?”

“Daddy it is *always* about the drinking!” Kenny lit up. The boy had always been shy, maybe a bit soft.

“Well this time, no one cares anymore. We ain’t here to get you to stop” Kenny continued.

Kenny was the third born. He’d always been a wimpy kid, but even Oscar had to admit that he’d come into his own as a man in the four years since he himself became a father.

“No one is ever gonna get you to stop.” Kenny said, rolling his eyes.

Oscar nodded proudly. He knew Kenny was the smartest of the whole bunch. More brain cells than his other four combined. Kenny understood him.

John stood up. At least five inches taller than either of his brothers, the first born son of Oscar and Martha Bonaventure was like a clone of Oscar - tall, strong, and none too bright.

“Listen dad its about your cat.” John explained.

Oscar didn’t know where this could be going but he was immediately suspicious. Despite all of the ways in which he was like his father, John *did* grow up in this new generation of soft little pussy liberal babies with their interventions, their loser trophies, and whatever nefarious cultural trend that Hollywood was currently cooking up.

“You’re here for Scooter?” Oscar said.

“Yes Oscar. ” Martha implored. “Scooter has special needs. He ain’t gonna do it y’all. I told you this was a waste of time.”

“Is this that retard thing?” Though relieved, Oscar was baffled that the pussy liberal woke ideology had infected his family this way.

They tried to explain to him that the cat has *special needs*. They tried to tell him that his only companion just needs a few *appliances* and *special medications*. They tried to tell him not to say words like “retard”, “pussy”or “cripple”

Oscar knew what it was code for. They had all left him here to die out in this shack. They took everything from him, and now they wanted to take away his cat too.

They began shouting over eachother, each trying to make their own point about the matter.

“Listen here everyone! Scooter ain’t no retard cat!” Oscar shouted cutting through the noise, “Let me say it again for y’all. Scooter! Ain’t! A! Retard! And even if he was, he just an animal, I ain’t gon’ treat him different or nothin’. So take your orthapedic hypnogogic, orthodontic, ergonomic, tempurepedic ayurvedic crap outta my house!”

There was a pause in the crosstalk as Mary began sobbing.

Oscar was not gonna give up ground just because his daughter started crying. For Christ’s sake, she was a grown woman! Oscar had half a mind to slap her like he used to.

“Why you cryin’?” Oscar asked belligerently.

“Because daddy, they gonna take Scooter away!” Mary said as she sobbed.

“What are you talking about?!”Oscar rasped, “What are you...” Oscar trailed off and turned to Kenny, his face grave.

Kenny’s glance at the stranger, the doctor, seemed to say “don’t ask me - ask him”.

Oscar looked at the doctor, who was now the only person who had remained seated during all of this.

“Who is this? What are you talking about?”

The man stood up. With by far the least accented voice in the room, and possibly the least accented voice Oscar had heard in person in the last decade, the doctor said “Hello Oscar my name is Rupert Weinman, and I’m a veterinarian specializing in feline neuro science.”

“Alright sir, well thank you for coming by, but I can assure you, Scooter ain’t a retard.” Oscar said.

“No one is saying that” Rupert said calmly. “Scooter has what we call...”

Oscar wore a look somewhere between anger and apathy. He didn’t interrupt, but he did start to tune the man out. Neuro science? It’s just a made up word. He had some sort of document with a scan on it.

Oscar knew those scans were bullshit, just tests to see if you were ready for brainwashing by George Soros. And that last name, Weinman. Sounded jewish. Definitely a red flag.

At some point, Rupert finished his little speech and said “Do you understand what that means Oscar?”

Oscar hesitated. As Rupert held the document out, Oscar’s family stood in expectant silence.

“Say again?” Oscar asked.

“Scooter has epilepsy Oz. Just like his mama.” Martha calmly explained to Oscar. There were tears in her eyes. Oscar looked around, he saw tears in everyone’s eyes.

Scooter’s mother was a cat named “Mama Wildcat”. She passed away in pain and agony due to Oscar’s lack of understanding.

He saw that now. It dredged up all of the memories from just ten years ago, when he and Martha finally got the divorce. He had thought the cat died of sadness, but now it all finally clicked.

Epilepsy wasn’t some made up pussy liberal thing. Mama wildcat had a rough go, and Oscar had always regretted losing her so young.

Now Scooter was almost twice that age, and he hadn’t shown any symptoms. Oscar swiped the document from the veterinarian’s outstretched hand and began flipping through.

It was almost unintelligible to him. These democrats were good at one thing: making up fancy sounding words.

He flipped to the end. The picture was just an X-ray, he couldnt see what was wrong.

The last page had in simple english “Diagnosis: Feline Epilepsy. Positive: 94%” Oscar wasn’t the sharpest tool in the shed but he understood that.

He looked up, tears welling in his eyes. “But there’s something we can do?”

Right when the Veterinarian began to respond, multiple of Oscar’s family members let out loud outbursts of anger mixed with relief.

“Are you fucking kidding me?” Kenny shouted.

“Thirty years we try to get him to stop smoking. One X-ray of the cat and now he’s onboard with modern medicine” Jimmy, Oscar’s youngest, said to no one in particular.

Tabitha and John were snickering to eachother “Maybe if we can get daddy scanned...” “Oh no he’ll never go for that.”

The room filled with laughter for a moment as Doctor Rupert explained the various medicines, and some of the appliances made for helping Cats with Epilepsy. Oscar’s newfound openness has lightened the mood for almost the entire family.

Martha had sat back down in shock. She saw Oscar shaking Rupert’s hand as he said something agreeable. Scooter had nestled up beside her, as he was in the habit of doing whenever she had come by in the last ten years.

She picked Scooter up by his scruff and began walking over to Oscar.

Oscar smiled “There he is, our honorable guest, Scooter. Who is NOT RETARDED!” he said half jokingly.

At that moment the taser went off. The shock went through their entangled arms and they dropped to the floor in a pile.

1inw5av,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1inw5av/i_26f_and_45m_met_at_the_gym_and_had_a_fallout/,I 26F and 45M met at the gym and had a fallout recently. Advice?,"I met this man at the gym over five months ago, and he was the one who initiated most of our conversations and interactions whenever we saw each other. However, since the coffee fallout, I now feel like he’s intentionally avoiding me at the gym.

The situation initially seemed like a simple and casual coffee meetup. I had shared a few friendly exchanges with him at the gym, and there seemed to be a mutual interest in connecting outside of that space. When he expressed interest in meeting for coffee, I took it as a straightforward and low-pressure plan, not expecting anything beyond a casual conversation. I didn’t perceive it as a date or anything more significant than just enjoying a coffee together and chatting outside the gym.

I made the effort to suggest a time and place, showing initiative and openness. He agreed, which seemed to confirm that he was still interested in following through with the plan. However, when the day arrived, things took an unexpected turn. He canceled at the last minute, citing an excuse that didn’t feel entirely genuine, particularly because of the timing and how little notice he gave me. I had already taken time to get ready, and even cleaned my car because of the snow that morning, which showed that I was committed to the plan. So, when he canceled and didn’t express much concern for the inconvenience, it left me feeling frustrated, disrespected, and unimportant.

At that point, I decided to set a boundary by informing him that I wasn’t interested in rescheduling or making future plans. I wasn’t necessarily angry, but the situation felt like a pattern of lack of consideration and effort on his part, which didn’t sit well with you.

I saw his cancellation as a sign that he wasn’t as invested in following through as I was, even though he’d initiated the coffee meetup both in person and through text before. It made me feel like I had been the one to take on most of the effort in making the plans, while he only followed along passively. This left me questioning his intentions — whether he truly cared to meet up or if he was just offering the idea without any real commitment behind it.

I also began to wonder about his overall interest in me, especially when, after the fallout, he didn’t try to reach out and make things right. His behavior seemed to suggest that he didn’t care enough about the connection to make an effort, which ultimately led you to step away. His lack of accountability and genuine follow-through made me realize that my time and energy were better spent elsewhere, where my efforts would be appreciated.

In summary, I was simply looking for a casual meet-up with someone I thought was friendly, but his actions (or lack thereof) made me feel disrespected and unimportant. I set a boundary by stepping away because I realized that if he truly cared about connecting with you, he would have done more to show it.",0,1739380709.0,relationship_advice,7,0.2,False

Just wanted to say that all conversation with my ex was only throught text messages. Thanks!!

I (26f), was with my ex (28m) for about 5 months. We dated from June to October 2024. After our relationship, I blocked him on everything. He wanted to stay friends, but I've been dealing with mental health problems for a couple years. So, I needed him to be completely blocked out of my life to get back on the right path. I unblocked him about two weeks ago, cuz I'm feeling much better! I wanted to keep him informed about my mental health and how I'm doing cuz he was always there when I needed him. When we we're a couple, he's helped me through a lot including visiting me at the hospital in the psychiatric unit. He's a good guy, but not the right one for me.

With that said, two weeks ago I unblocked him. We started talking and I made it VERY clear that I wasn't ready to get back in a relationship with anybody and that I love being single, that I feel free and amazing. He's also saying that he's single and he hasn't been seeing anybody and he loves the freedom. He's also saying creepy weird shit like ""Sometimes when I play with myself I think about you"" or ""Do you remember when we we're naked in the shower and we we're laughing"". I told him straight up that I don't him that way and he should stop thinking about me that way. It's disgusting and gross.

Then a week later, he blocks me out of nowhere. I'm unable to reach him. 5 days later, he unblocks me and says that he has a gilfriend. He says that he blocked me because he was scared of my reaction. He tells me that they been together for two weeks, but they made it official on social media 5 days ago. I tell him that what's making me mad is not that he has a gilfriend, but that he has been lying to me for the past week! So all the bullshit of ""I'm single and I haven't been seeing anybody and I love the freedom"" wasn't true. 

Two days ago was the last time that I talked to him. At the end of that day, I blocked him. I'm done. Throughout the day, he kept saying little things like ""When you're mentally ready, I would love to take you out to coffee so we can catch up in person"" or ""I know you watched Squid game, I haven't. We should watch it together!"". Around 7PM that same day, he put the cherry on top by saying ""Remember when we we're having fun in bed and the dildo fell out of your vagina and I screamed It's a boy!"". At that point I was DONE! I was direct and told him ""You have a girlfriend. You should be thinking about her. Not me. Stop thinking about me when you masturbate. Think about your girlfriend. Stop thinking about me naked in the shower. Stop thinking about taking me out to coffee. You keep saying that you don't have feelings for me anymore, but it doesn't seem like it. It's not cool for your gilfriend. You're playing with her emotions. I'm a girls girl and if you keep that shit up, I'm gonna tell her.""

After I sent him that message, I blocked him on everything. My step-mom told me that my ex texted her to tell me that he's sorry and he's gonna be a better boyfriend and he will stop talking to me in that way. He also felt I was too direct and mean. My step-mom thinks I was a bit too rough on him.

So Reddit, am I the asshole for being direct with my ex?

But a long to-do list just seems like work.  
  
Then, I started approaching my routines differently. In the morning, not only do I do tasks that get *me* ready for the day, I will also do tasks that get my space ready for the day. I think to myself, ""I need to wake up my apartment too"". I get the coffee started, water my plants, and make my bed. Then, in the evenings, I think ""I need to get my apartment ready for sleep"". I make sure the dishes are done, tidy up the space, etc. That mindset shift has been very helpful for me in maintaining a productive rhythm.

Has anyone else tried this approach? Does it work for you, and if so, which tasks do you include in your morning/evening routines related to household duties?",4,1739380359.0,getdisciplined,1,1.0,False

My maintainance is around 2200-2400 (not really sure I've never had a maintainance phase, I've been struggling to lose weight for years and have only recently fully committed) 
171cm, Started at 75kg now I'm down to 68.3. 

I've been consuming 1600 calories a day with the occasional cheat meal. 
For the last week or so I've hit a plateau, my body weight hasn't dropped below 68.00 kg. I measure my weight every morning after a coffee and taking a dump for a consistent measurement. 
I'm 100% sure I'm in a deficit and I'm counting my calories correctly. For reference my diet is 2 small bananas + one protein bar + one protein shake (2 scoops, 500ml milk) + chicken and rice almost every day with the occasional switch up for dinner. I generally get around 130g of protein daily. I've been taking creatine monohydrate for almost a year now. 
I sleep 7-8 hours a night consistently and work out 5 times a week with 10-15k steps daily.

1invyk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1invyk4/is_this_subreddit_really_against_work/,Is this subreddit really against work?,"Yeah, that's the subreddit name. Anti-work. 

But here's the thing. 

Most of the threads talk about personal frustrations at work and being able to get basic needs (housing, food, healthcare, etc.). 

None of the threads seem to be really attacking work, though. And I don't think people want to really attack work. I mean, if we don't have work at all, then who will take out the garbage? Who is going to fix the roads from time to time? Who is going to fight fires? Old people need nursing home care, and the workers aren't going to work for free. And we still need knowledgeable people providing medical advice based on evidence in the medical and scientific literature and skillful people performing surgeries. None of these people will work for free. Some surgeons will definitely have higher success rate in surgery than others while other surgeons are merely mediocre. And of course, everyone wants the best surgeons so the best surgeons will get the most demand. I once watched a YouTube video featuring a Japanese internment camp and what the people ate there, and basically some people were good cooks and some people were sucky cooks. And the good cooks always had a long line while the sucky cooks had a few, and then there was a policy change, forcing the people to stand in both lines equally, and some people got stuck with really bad cooks. 

In a competitive society, we do have winners and losers, but in a more compassionate society, we will help the losers find their own little place and help them become winners in another area. They need to find their own competitive edge. For people who haven't found their own competitive edge in life, they can be given a free bedroom (6 feet by 6 feet by 6 feet) for sleeping, a shared kitchen space for cooking, a shared dining space for eating. They will be given a cheap smartphone for communication and entertainment. They will be trained for specific jobs and they will be placed at specific jobs for pay. The more successful workers will become employees, and employed folks will still stay at the shelter until they can afford a housing unit. 

Also, another topic would be entrepreneurship. A person may be out of the mandatory public schooling system, and may choose to work at a bakery / coffee shop nearby. The person works there for maybe 3 years and saves all the earnings in the bank account. The person may live with parents and the parents support the person financially, allowing the person to save 100% of earnings. Then, the person takes his/her savings to finance a small business. The person may also apply for small business grants because grant money is money that does not have to be paid back with interest. Then, the person becomes The Employer. This topic is kind of pro-capitalist because it is about employers, but the employer here is a sole proprietor. 

Sole proprietorships can be anything that the entrepreneur can invest into. The sole proprietor has to risk personal assets, though. Sometimes, a business idea is just very expensive to do. It requires a lot of capital investment from people. So, the person can choose to make a corporation business and try to get investors. The main goal is to make money for the business owners and the investors. Technically, an employee can also be an investor, but most likely, the employee would be too poor to invest funds or would be unwilling to take the risks of business. The employee just wants a guaranteed pay no matter what. Anyway, a person may be employed in a company for some time as a chemical engineer, then they decide to leave the corporate world in order to start his/her own pharmaceutical company. His/her own skills will be used to engineer new chemicals, new drugs, and test them. This requires a lot of capital investment, though. 

Creative people can get on Kickstarter and post a project. If people are interested in the project, then they will donate money to the project. Then the money will be used to hire workers. Of course, if the Kickstarter thing is a flop, then the creative person has to essentially work solo on the project. And the final product would be a bit amateurish in quality. But hey, a person has to start somewhere!!!

I think the people's basic needs must be met first. Housing and food. Once the basic needs are met, the person can function like a decent human. Then, the person will work to make money. ",0,1739380261.0,antiwork,8,0.23,False

1invvap,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesidehustle/comments/1invvap/were_designing_websites_for_free_for/,We’re designing websites for free for startups/small businesses,"Hey, everyone!! David from that free website here, I want to pitch you guys our business model real quick. So, we’re an unusual Web Design Agency, what is uncommon about us is the fact that we design websites for donations, or free of charge, as some would say.

How’s this possible? So, first thing’s first, we’ve been in business for about 4 years now, it started as a college assignment and turned into something greater than that. 

We fell in love with the process, both networking with our clients and the design process itself. We figured out a way to make it profitable for us, while keeping it under the lowest possible budget for our clients, since we were collaborating with a lot of startups and small business owners that were not able to spare hundreds of dollars on getting their websites done. 

So, how does it work? We’ve partnered up with almost every reputable Hosting Provider out there. For those who are not familiar with Hosting Services, in a nutshell, every website needs hosting in order for it to function. Basically, if you want to open a coffee shop, before you do so, you have to rent the space, it is exactly the same with websites, if you want people to be able to find your website online, you have to pay for Hosting, which usually is a couple of dollars/month. That being said, we reached an agreement with most Hosting Providers, so for every website that we create and for every client they get on our behalf, we get paid a small amount of the cost of Hosting. 

Now, just to make things clear, that doesn’t mean that our clients pay more for Hosting in order for us to get the money, on the opposite, because they are our clients, they get to enjoy all the deals, sales and cut costs even more. And one more important thing, many people tought that we recommend really expensive Hosting Services, in order for us to get more money from it, we’re not. In 99% of the cases, we recommend people to go for plans that come to around $35/year, domain included. 

This is how we manage to make it work. This is nothing more than a side hustle, we don’t actually plan on making a lot of money or scaling it to the top. We enjoy the process, and we found a way to make it sustainable both for our clients and for us. 

I want to be very clear about one thing, we’re not the best, and we don’t aspire to be. There are a lot of web designers out there that outrun us by a mile, but this is why they charge a lot more for their work. 

One thing that we can promise you tho, is we always do our best. 

Again, I want to thank you guys for taking the time to read this, and I really hope we’ll get to collaborate with as many of you guys as possible!!

1invuic,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestCoffeeTables/comments/1invuic/seventable_hqkfzh00704_coffee_table_review_is_it/,Seventable hq-kfzh007-04 coffee table review: Is it worth the hype?,"I recently added the Seventable hq-kfzh007-04 coffee table to my living room, and it’s been quite the experience. Right out of the box, it was clear this wasn’t your average piece of furniture. From its rustic brown finish to the innovative lift-top design, it promised both style and utility. But as someone who tests products daily, I can confidently say this table is more than just a pretty face.

The design caught my eye immediately. Its engineered wood construction feels sturdy, and the laminated melamine finish gives it a polished yet rustic vibe. The straight-leg design complements my living room's minimalist aesthetic, but I can easily see this fitting into more traditional or farmhouse-style setups too. At 47.2 inches wide, it’s large enough to serve as the centerpiece of a living room without overwhelming the space.

What truly sets this coffee table apart is its two-way lift-top mechanism. Whether I’m using my laptop, having dinner while binge-watching a series, or just need a higher surface for sorting paperwork, the split-top design is an absolute game-changer. The hydraulic arms operate smoothly and quietly, which is something I didn’t expect at this price point. I even tested it with a hefty stack of books, and it held up without wobbling. That said, you do need both hands to maneuver the tops, so it’s not the simplest mechanism out there.

[Check Seventable hq-kfzh007-04 coffee table price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product/seventable-hq-kfzh007-04-coffee-table-review-b09c7hd558/)

**Storage on steroids** is how I’d describe this coffee table. Beneath the lift-tops, two hidden compartments offer ample space for stashing remotes, magazines, or even my kids’ coloring supplies. The two drawers are equally handy, gliding open smoothly without any signs of sticking. The hidden compartments keep dust at bay, which is perfect for someone like me who despises constant cleaning. Speaking of cleaning, the surface does show fingerprints, especially if your hands are slightly oily. If you’re a neat freak, this might be a minor annoyance.

Assembly was another aspect I was curious about. It took me about three hours to put it together, with a mix of manual effort and my trusty electric screwdriver. The instructions were picture-based, and while they were mostly clear, I did spend some time figuring out the orientation of the lift-top mechanism. If you’re assembling it solo, be prepared for a bit of a workout. The table’s weight—60 pounds—makes it a two-person job for moving around, but that heft also contributes to its stability.

**Pros**

* The lift-top mechanism is incredibly versatile and sturdy.
* Multiple storage options, including hidden compartments and drawers.
* Rustic and timeless design with durable engineered wood construction.
* Decent stability; no wobbling even under significant weight.
* Fits a range of interior styles, from modern to farmhouse.

**Cons**

* Fingerprints and smudges are noticeable on the surface.
* Assembly instructions lack written explanations, which could confuse some users.
* Hydraulic arms require both hands for operation, making it less intuitive.
* The table might be too heavy for anyone needing to move it frequently.
* Doesn’t include enough stickers to cover all exposed screw holes.

When comparing this table to competitors, it stands out for its dual-lift mechanism, which is rare in coffee tables at this price range. Similar products often feature a single lift-top and lack the hidden compartments that set the Seventable apart. However, pricier models like those from West Elm or Pottery Barn tend to use higher-quality materials such as solid wood, which might age better over time. If you’re looking for a storage-heavy coffee table with a multi-functional design, this one edges out many competitors in its category.

The question of value is always crucial. The Seventable hq-kfzh007-04 coffee table offers a lot of functionality for the cost. While it doesn’t have the premium materials of high-end brands, it delivers on practicality and design. For someone on a budget or seeking a versatile piece for a family room or small apartment, this is a solid investment.

I’ve tested every feature, from the drawers to the lift-top’s weight-bearing capacity, and it hasn’t let me down. The table's ability to adapt to different tasks—be it dining, working, or just lounging—makes it a standout option. Sure, it has its quirks, but those are easy to overlook given its practicality and aesthetic appeal.

I only started about 3 weeks ago because a doctor recommended it as a way to deal with chronic acid reflux symptoms. I was amazed at how much it helped. On a scale of 1-10, my symptoms went from 8-9 to 4-5. However, I'd like them to disappear completely, and I've read people here who say keto completely fixed their GERD. 



Additional note:  
Since my sleep tends to be very heavy and I often need more than 8 hours of sleep but can't always get them, I'd love to find a way to solve this without completely giving up coffee. 

I had given it up before starting keto and that had helped a little but hadn't fixed the problem. While on keto I tried coffee again and it seems to make things worse. According to what I've read about keto and how it works, there's no reason why coffee should be bad for my GERD (although more traditional, non-keto sources who recommend things like eating oatmeal do say coffee is bad for GERD).

1invocb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFitStories/comments/1invocb/my_cousin_sarahs_genius_wave_experiment_from/,"My Cousin Sarah’s Genius Wave Experiment: From Skeptic to Study Machine (Chicago, Feb 2024)","Hey Reddit fam! I’ve gotta share this wild little story about my cousin Sarah and her obsession with this audio program called The Genius Wave. If you’ve ever struggled to focus during crunch time (grad students, I’m looking at you), this might pique your interest.

**Backstory:**

Sarah (25, lives in Chicago) is in her final year of grad school for architecture. Between thesis deadlines and part-time work, she was drowning in stress. She’d tried everything—meditation apps, caffeine IVs (kidding… mostly), even those weird “focus” essential oils. Nothing stuck. Then in early February 2024, she stumbled on an ad for The Genius Wave, a sound-frequency program claiming to boost focus and creativity. She rolled her eyes but bought it anyway—mostly out of desperation.

**The Setup:**

The program is just audio tracks you listen to with headphones. Sarah started using it every morning before her studio sessions. Her first reaction? “It sounds like a spa crossed with a sci-fi movie.” The tracks mix nature sounds (think rainstorms) with these deep, pulsing tones. She almost quit after Day 1 because it felt “too weird,” but hey, desperation breeds commitment.

[The Genius Wave](https://preview.redd.it/mymnx7tcoqie1.png?width=826&format=png&auto=webp&s=111b678b8707efbbf53417ef1559994e596e02bc)

**What Happened Next:**

Week 1: Sarah swore she felt calmer during her 8-hour studio marathons. Normally, she’d get twitchy after 2 hours, but she pulled off a full design draft without doomscrolling once. (Unheard of.)

Week 2: Her professor noticed her sketches were “sharper and more innovative.” Sarah joked it was the “robot waves,” but secretly, she was shook.

Week 3: The pièce de résistance—she finished her thesis proposal a week early. For someone who lives in deadline chaos, this was like spotting a unicorn.

**Her Takeaways:**

Focus: “It’s like my brain stopped trying to juggle 10 tabs at once.”

Creativity: She designed a rooftop garden concept that her prof called “groundbreaking” (pun intended).

Sleep: She’d play the relaxation track at night and actually slept instead of stress-Googling “how to survive grad school.”

**The Catch(es):**

Headphones Required: Sarah hated being tethered to her laptop. No AirPods? No magic.

Consistency: Skipping days = “meh” results. She set phone reminders to stay on track.

Price: Dropping $47 on audio felt nuts to her at first. Now? “Cheaper than therapy,” she laughs.

**If you're interested in trying Genius Wave, you can find more information and make a purchase here ----->** [**The Genius Wave Official Website**](https://freezegluco.com/TheGeniusWave.html)

**Why I’m Sharing This:**

Look, I’m not saying this is a miracle cure. Sarah still drinks iced coffee like it’s water and cries over CAD software. But seeing her go from “I’m dropping out” to “I’ve got this” in a month was kinda mind-blowing. She’s not a “woo-woo” person either—this is the same girl who mocked my crystal collection.

“What if every new hire had a roadmap for success in their first 90 days? Every new role starts with questions: Where do I begin? How do I add value? The First 90 Days turns uncertainty into a plan.”

Why not include a self or personal -checklist for new hires in your onboarding kit? The checklist will include the things that a new hire does before joining the company for smooth transition. Like what will be his learning goals, how he will do stakeholder mapping, how he will understand key business challenges, identification of early win opportunities, what will be his cross-functional relationship building plans, and ways to add value within their role. For instance, an employee might list ""schedule coffee chats with three team members per week"" or ""identify one process improvement opportunity by day 45."" 

This self-created checklist will show initiative and helps employees transition from being ""new hires"" to ""contributors"" more quickly. The personal checklist becomes a living document that evolves as the employee gains deeper understanding of the organization's culture, politics, and operational needs, ultimately helping them achieve their break-even point (where they create more value than they consume) faster. 

HR teams—this is the onboarding tool you didn’t know you needed.

&nbsp;

**Christianity and the Church: No Different Than Psychotic Covert Narcissism**

&nbsp;

By and large, churches within Christianity operate like covert narcissists.

The reason I was able to break away from the church and Christianity after 43 years was that it followed the same blueprint as my covertly narcissistic ex-wife.

Once you recognize the patterns and behaviors and begin to heal, you start seeing them everywhere—government, marriage, career, education, healthcare, and beyond.

What you’ll find is that most people live comfortably miserable lives. They resign themselves to repeating the abusive cycle, never truly free.

I was surprised by how easily I let go of the Bible and Christianity. But looking back, I had already been breaking free from other forms of control over the past 10 years, if not most of my life.

I guess it was only a matter of time before I acknowledged Christianity for what it truly is—an abusive cult.

Yes, you heard that correctly. It’s an abusive cult.

One wrapped in smiles and ""warmth,"" luring well-meaning, empathetic churchgoers into its web of deceit and manipulation.

It all clicked for me when I saw a comment stating, ""Christianity is not a religion.""

They truly believe they are different, set apart. They insist, ""It's about relationship, not religion.""
 
&nbsp;

**The Narcissistic Blueprint**

&nbsp;

Think about it: the moment you accept Jesus, you're hit with a wave of love, hugs, and acceptance.

They welcome you into the community (**LOVE BOMBING**). It feels incredible, like you’ve made the right decision. Even if you have doubts, the emotional high convinces you it must be true.

This is exactly what happens with a covert narcissist.

They make you feel like you’re their soulmate.
They LOVE you.
They admire everything about you.

You feel seen, valued, even cherished.

Then the paper cuts begin—small, subtle jabs. Minor criticisms disguised as ""concern.""

At first, the word ""abuse"" may sound harsh.

After all, how could a loving church or pastor be abusive?

But the reality is that this has been happening for centuries. The most empathetic and well-meaning people are the easiest to manipulate.

You sit in church, and week after week, they remind you of your need for a savior.

At first, you don’t notice it. You’re still basking in the warmth of acceptance.

The fear of hell and damnation seems like it’s meant for someone else.

And yet… you start to wonder.

*""Am I really saved?""*

Interesting, isn’t it? The word ""saved"" implies safety.

Does a child ever wonder if their parent's blood runs through their veins? Do they ever question if they truly belong in their family?

Yet in church, they keep you questioning—week after week—through altar calls, ""prayer,"" and ""rededication.""

Just to make sure.

&nbsp;

**The Slow Indoctrination**

&nbsp;

It starts off so friendly.

 - Sunday School with coffee and donuts and cute name badges to make you feel welcome

 -  A new believer’s\membership class.

 - Wednesday bible study  

 - Church history and their interpretation of the bible according to their church\denomination 

 - Sign ups...... YAY



They invite you to prayer meetings, men’s or women’s groups.

They encourage you to volunteer—after all, it’s fun.

And they love you.

But beneath it all lurks the threat—the fear of hidden sin, demonic strongholds, and spiritual warfare sprinkled into Sunday morning sermons.  Oh, and don't forget to **TITHE!**  This is paramount!

Week after week, you wonder:

""Am I truly saved? Do I really know Jesus?""

If you dare to ask questions, you're gaslit.

""We must be very careful when questioning the Bible. After all, it’s 100% true—God’s inspired, infallible word.""

You start asking about Noah’s Ark—how did all those animals fit?

Or why God supposedly regretted creating humanity in the first place.

Or how just eight people supposedly repopulated the entire world.

Suddenly, you're stirring up trouble.

You're called in for a one-on-one meeting with an elder or pastor.

But your questions are never answered with logic or reason—only faith and ""trusting God.""

And what do most people do?

Nothing.

Because they don’t want to be the boat rocker.

So the cycle continues.

The church believes it’s always right.
And anyone who questions it is seen as the problem.

If you start missing church, suddenly they’re concerned about you.

But in reality, they want your attendance and your money.

They keep tabs on you. Policing you.

All in ""love,"" of course.

&nbsp;

**The Church = The Narcissistic Partner**

&nbsp;


This is no different from a covert narcissist marriage.

 - Nothing you do is ever good enough.  

 - They are critical of everything.

 - If you call out their behavior, they turn it back on you.

 - Your feelings are dismissed.

 - Your concerns are minimized.

 - You’re the one with the problem.

They never apologize.
They never take responsibility.
They are never accountable.

They are always right. You are always wrong.

Once you break free from the gaslighting, trickle-truthing, and shame, you begin to heal.

You start thinking clearly.

You finally see the love bombing, devaluing, and discarding for what it really is—an abusive cycle.

&nbsp;

**Breaking Free**

&nbsp;

I went through the same psychological abuse with Christianity as I did with my ex-wife.

 - There is no accountability.

 - No responsibility.

 - No self-awareness.

Church leaders and congregants spin fairy tales and word salad explanations that go nowhere.

And if you challenge them?

Suddenly, the church is the victim, and you are the problem.

If leadership is out of line or abusive, they are defended at all costs.

And God forbid you question the pastor.

How dare you.

If you don’t fall in line, you’re discarded.

&nbsp;

**The Reality of Christianity**

&nbsp;

In truth, they are the monsters—draining you of your kindness, empathy, resources, and money.

 - Always needing more volunteers.
    
 - More donations.

 - More loyalty and participation

&nbsp;

It’s never enough.

Because Christianity and narcissism share the same blueprint—keeping you comfortably miserable.

If you speak out, you’re met with a wave of criticism.

 - ""You’re negative.""
  
 - ""You’re bitter.""
    
 - ""Your tone is wrong.""
    
 - ""You’re the angry one.""

It’s never the narcissist, the pastor, or the well-meaning church.

&nbsp;

You are the problem.  You are disrupting the system.  You are the pariah.

And so, people stay.

Because they’ve been conditioned.  Love bombed. Devalued.  Eventually Discarded.

If they don’t outright kick you out, you’ll eventually leave. Only to find another church.  And the cycle continues.

&nbsp;

**The Common Denominator**

&nbsp;

 - They never take responsibility.

 - They never hold themselves accountable.

 - They never fully explain anything.

&nbsp;

Instead, they manipulate. They word salad.  They prey on your kindness.  The only way to be free is to leave.

But that’s not easy.  Because at the end of the day, who doesn’t long for love and acceptance?  Even if it’s toxic.
Even if it’s abusive.  Even if it’s only given when you’re obedient.

But real love and acceptance?

You shouldn't have to earn that.  It shouldn't be with quiet conditions.  

Once you truly break free, you’ll never go back.  Once you see the pattern and get better and get healthy you'll never go back to that abuse ever again.  

&nbsp;

So what will you do once you're free and realize it's just a cult and nonsense?  

After you get some space to clear your head maybe you'll write something up like this and try to help others understand that they aren't crazy.  Their feelings and warmth have been taken advantage of.  They were never the problem or to blame.  You explain they just got swept up in wanting to be part of something and a community trying to do their best.  It's not their fault.

&nbsp;

Thank you for reading.........this is just a rough go here.........please feel free to add or critique.

All the best :)",0,1739379318.0,Deconstruction,2,0.5,False
1invjfs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1invjfs,Dune Weaver Pro’s maiden voyage,"Share something freakin' cool that you 3D printed. I'll go first: a 75cm x 48cm (29.5 x 19in) kinetic coffee-table-sized sand table! After making the Dune Weaver (https://makerworld.com/en/models/841332?from=search#profileId-787553) and the Dune Weaver Mini (https://makerworld.com/en/models/896314?from=search#profileId-854412), being an Apple fan, I have to make the Dune Weaver Pro (and maybe the Dune Weaver Pro Max in the future 😉).


I have these principles when I set out to design the Dune Weaver Pro:

Make it 3D-printing-friendly, in other words, strictly use 3D printable parts where possible. Most (if not all) of the designs out there use a lot of extra hardware like belts, railings, or non-3D printable parts.

Use easily sourced parts so anyone can make it.
It has to look good. The ""Wife approval factor"" is very important to me!

It has to be affordable. A commercial table of this size costs thousands. The running BOM is about $150-$200 CAD, depending on what you have on hand.
It has to be super quiet

Improve upon my previous designs

With these goals in mind, I found the perfect hardware for it, the IKEA VITTSJÖ table. This table costs 70$ CAD, much cheaper than even a custom-cut glass top of this size. It has a wooden base and a glass top, perfect for the base and the glass cover of the Dune Weaver Pro. 

I ended up flipping the steel bar upside down and designing a base that sits in the middle of the + crossbar. The wooden base, I used as a sand tray. I designed an enclosure that holds the glass ring and the glass.

Dune Weaver Pro is powered by two Nema 17 motors connected to a DLC32 board, running Fluidnc firmware. There's a Raspberry Pi connected to it via USB, sending theta rho converted gcode to the DLC32. The UI is the same one that I built for the two smaller sand tables, with tremendous help from the community (special thank to Thom Koopman).

I used about 1.5 kg of filaments for this build, the majority of which goes to the enclosure. Here's the list of non 3D printed parts:

IKEA VITTSJÖ table
Two Nema 17 motors
DLC32 + TMC 2209 drivers
6 inch lazy susan
Magnet and magnet ball
Faux leather for sand bed
A Raspberry Pi
LED and an ESP32 for WLED

This is still a work in progress, but I'm so excited that I want to share this build with y'all. Would love to hear any feedback or ideas you may have to improve this further! ",31,1739379276.0,3Dprinting,15,0.94,False

Reposting again - here's to optimism and not giving up.

I am a 35 year old single nerd (yes, very unique on reddit), both in personal and professional life. I am an expat living in the Netherlands but originally from India(oh dear, Indian, run away!! )

Still here?... well read on..

I have been away from home for more than 12 years, for both educational and professional reasons. Last 3 years were spent in the Netherlands. I am not sure where I will be tomorrow - perhaps back in Asia or US - life takes you places, but I am here for now and the loneliness is getting to me. It has been more than a year since I dated anyone and I am finally at a point where both mind and body desire some affection and intimacy. I am looking for a connection - be it just friendship with the possibility of something more, but a connection nonetheless.

More about me:

On a fitness journey. Trying to work out at least 4 days a week and eating healthy. I am getting stronger but there is much work to be done. The latter part has been harder as I absolutely love food - I think it is the single greatest pleasure of life. Would love to connect with someone who is also into fitness or at least seriously considering getting into it so we can encourage each other as opposed to enabling the bad habits.

I like the usual nerdy things - gaming, fantasy and sci-fiction, manga, and the occasional anime. Not a requirement that you be a nerd but it helps :)

I am a lifelong tourist, love traveling and enjoy road trips. Been to over 30 countries, always looking forward to my next vacation, and want to see the whole world!

Other details about me:

* Introvert
* Much more shy and socially awkward than I would like to be :p
* Politically liberal/left
* Don't smoke or drink alcohol, but coffee is my poison!
* Vegetarian
* Love touch and adore cuddles :)
* Non Vanilla, but that is for (much) later ;)

I am generally an easy going and an agreeable person, but strong religious inclinations and an anti-science mindset are absolute deal breakers. This is already too long so lastly, I am looking for something IRL and would prefer speaking to people who are in the Netherlands or within short distances.

If my post resonates with you, do reach out and please leave an introduction.

Stay safe,

I am not sure where I will be tomorrow - perhaps back in Asia or US - life takes you places, but I am here for now and the loneliness is getting to me. It has been more than a year since I dated anyone and I am finally at a point where both mind and body desire some affection and intimacy. I am looking for a connection - be it just friendship with the possibility of something more, but a connection nonetheless.

More about me:

On a fitness journey. Trying to work out at least 4 days a week and eating healthy. I am getting stronger but there is much work to be done. The latter part has been harder as I absolutely love food - I think it is the single greatest pleasure of life. Would love to connect with someone who is also into fitness or at least seriously considering getting into it so we can encourage each other as opposed to enabling the bad habits.

I like the usual nerdy things - gaming, fantasy and sci-fiction, manga, and the occasional anime. Not a requirement that you be a nerd but it helps :)

I am a lifelong tourist, love traveling and enjoy road trips. Been to over 30 countries, always looking forward to my next vacation, and want to see the whole world!

Other details about me:

* Introvert
* Much more shy and socially awkward than I would like to be :p
* Politically liberal/left
* Don't smoke or drink alcohol, but coffee is my poison!
* Vegetarian
* Love touch and adore cuddles :)
* Non Vanilla, but that is for (much) later ;)

I am generally an easy going and an agreeable person, but strong religious inclinations and an anti-science mindset are absolute deal breakers. This is already too long so lastly, I am looking for something IRL and would prefer speaking to people who are in the Netherlands or within short distances.

If my post resonates with you, do reach out and please leave an introduction.

Stay safe,

Cheers!",1,1739379245.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I’m not exaggerating—on my daily coffee walk, I’m stopped at least twice.

1invhka,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1invhka,Dune Weaver Pro’s maiden voyage,"Share something freakin' cool that you 3D printed. I'll go first: a 75cm x 48cm (29.5 x 19in) kinetic coffee-table-sized sand table! After making the Dune Weaver (https://makerworld.com/en/models/841332?from=search#profileId-787553) and the Dune Weaver Mini (https://makerworld.com/en/models/896314?from=search#profileId-854412), being an Apple fan, I have to make the Dune Weaver Pro (and maybe the Dune Weaver Pro Max in the future 😉).


I have these principles when I set out to design the Dune Weaver Pro:

Make it 3D-printing-friendly, in other words, strictly use 3D printable parts where possible. Most (if not all) of the designs out there use a lot of extra hardware like belts, railings, or non-3D printable parts.

Use easily sourced parts so anyone can make it.
It has to look good. The ""Wife approval factor"" is very important to me!

It has to be affordable. A commercial table of this size costs thousands. The running BOM is about $150-$200 CAD, depending on what you have on hand.
It has to be super quiet

Improve upon my previous designs

With these goals in mind, I found the perfect hardware for it, the IKEA VITTSJÖ table. This table costs 70$ CAD, much cheaper than even a custom-cut glass top of this size. It has a wooden base and a glass top, perfect for the base and the glass cover of the Dune Weaver Pro. 

I ended up flipping the steel bar upside down and designing a base that sits in the middle of the + crossbar. The wooden base, I used as a sand tray. I designed an enclosure that holds the glass ring and the glass.

Dune Weaver Pro is powered by two Nema 17 motors connected to a DLC32 board, running Fluidnc firmware. There's a Raspberry Pi connected to it via USB, sending theta rho converted gcode to the DLC32. The UI is the same one that I built for the two smaller sand tables, with tremendous help from the community (special thank to Thom Koopman).

I used about 1.5 kg of filaments for this build, the majority of which goes to the enclosure. Here's the list of non 3D printed parts:

IKEA VITTSJÖ table
Two Nema 17 motors
DLC32 + TMC 2209 drivers
6 inch lazy susan
Magnet and magnet ball
Faux leather for sand bed
A Raspberry Pi
LED and an ESP32 for WLED

This is still a work in progress, but I'm so excited that I want to share this build with y'all. Would love to hear any feedback or ideas you may have to improve this further! ",11,1739379150.0,BambuLab,5,1.0,False

On Saturdays or holidays, my appetite is even worse. I barely get out of bed and often go the whole day without eating. Even bhok lagda pani, I get full after 8-10 spoons tespachi nyakka huncha.

It's the old mattress place on the corner by Frosty Boy. The big sign at the top would read ""The Spoon Girl - Artist Collective"" or something similar. I just can't get it out of my head lately, it actually keeps me up at night. It's been on the market for years and I just know that by the time I'm ready, it won't be available. The rent is insanely cheap for the space size and (from appearances) it's perfect for what I need.

Grand Rapids is such an ""art based"" city, yet there are way too many larger ""fine art"" galleries, and virtually no locally made/small business/maker galleries. Yeah, there are a lot of shops that might host some artists' work here and there, and some pieces on the walls of coffee shops and breweries, but I'm talking a whole place that is 100% locally made art that you can walk into and know you'll get quality made art that someone poured their soul into. The great stuff you find at the small markets and festivals. Glass blowers, print makers, textile work, painters, woodworkers, metalsmiths. I am a maker myself and those markets are so time consuming to prepare for/set-up/take-down, all for a 4 hour shopping window. You might make a few hundred in sales and they can cost a hundred or more to participate in. Oh, and don't forget about the weather factor. It's just so nice to have a physical space to host your work, but so many shops want 40% of your profits and that's really hard to swallow.

I used to live near Asheville, NC, and I loved how many art galleries there were with this kind of work, and many of them rented out studio space to work in as well. You could pay a small monthly rent for your selling space (or a percentage of sales, whichever would be more cost effective for you), and a lot of them would trade-off a shift or two a month to work the gallery desk for a portion of your rent.

My workshop is currently in my basement, but with a baby and hopefully more in the future, we're needing to reclaim the space and I need to move my workspace elsewhere. It would be so perfect to have a studio space where I can work, have a storefront, and host other artists, possibly rent studio space to those who don't have the space to work in their own homes. This stuff creates a hell of a mess! And with rent so ridiculously high, it's hard enough to afford a decent sized place to live, much less get extra space to work. That place on Plainfield has so many little rooms, they just beg to be filled with creativity, with a big corner window to display it all from!

I've helped managed an art gallery up-north in the Leelanau area and LOVED it (3rd/4th pictures - the peacock is mine). I know I could do it. I've sold my work at festivals for about 10 years, so I know some about sales, branding/aesthetic. And there are so many artists like me in the area that just need to get their art in front of people. Selling online just isn't it anymore. It's just the costs that scare me. I have no idea where to start when it comes to opening a physical space, I know I need to take a business class or something. But how much to save? How much do I need to start? If anything, I'd love some advice on getting this ball rolling if any of you have insight and resources.

Thanks for listening to my brain vomit. It feels good just to get it out, even if this doesn't get any attention. Also, the last pictures are some examples of my work, in case anyone is curious (silverware jewelry and metal upcycling).

Sincerely, a girl with a dream.

Edit: Yeah totally messed this post up and the pictures didn't attach the first time, and now they're not in the right order. Oh well, hopefully you get the idea.

1invcjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1invcjo/date_etiquette_text_the_day_of/,Date Etiquette - Text the day of?,"I'm trying to get serious about my dating life again as I'm in a place in my life where I think I'm ready to meet someone I can hopefully settle down with. I haven't met anyone I am very interested in until recently. We have a lot of mutual friends and I have thought he is cute for years now. We (ugh) matched on a dating app and I was ecstatic there was finally a way to open communication (I never message guys first on social media and at least the fact he liked me on the app lets me know he is attracted to me too). He is 38 (M) I am 26 (F).

After some chatting he let me know he has thought I am a ""mega-babe"" for a long time and didn't want to be too forward but asked me to come over for super bowl on Sunday. Long story short - I didn't hear from him until 4:00 that day. He sincerely apologized and said he had woken up early to clean and then fell asleep for a few hours on the couch. He said he still ""would be up for company"" that night, but understood he never got back to me and offered up an alternate day this week for drinks or coffee. We ended up chatting on the phone that night and I laid out perfectly that I don't want my time wasted and if he's not truly interested we don't need to meet at all. I feel a bit extreme, but I even stated I am looking for a relationship - better to be upfront than leave anything up for interpretation I guess. He assured me he is ""enamored"" with me and wants nothing more than to meet and he's interested as well.

I chose the latter, as I have learned to never sit around waiting for a guy all day, innocent mistake or not. Going about your day helps stifle disappointment. We planned for today after work as we both work a few blocks away from each other, get off around the same time, and there's plenty of places nearby. He offered up a place that I also like and said ""they have food as well in case we want to eat"". Which sounds optimistic enough, like hopefully we will make it past a drink or two.

Here's my hang up --- He is not a texter, like...at all. Now, I don't know this for sure, but my experience with him, he originally took a day for responses on the dating app - and 45-mins to hours for texting if I didn't reply immediately. Creepy, I know, BUT...I check to see if he's still active on the dating app daily, and his location is always current. So its not like he isn't using his phone. I hadn't heard from him after he told me he hoped I had a good day Monday and responded (that's fine). But I had to ask if we were still on for today as I wanted to finalize my schedule for today lastnight. He responded promptly and asked about my day, a few messages back and fourth - then he simply thumbs upped my last one and that' all.

Today I haven't heard from him. It's almost noon so I'm not super concerned yet. But here's the thing....he never finalized a time. Yeah, we get off around the same time but that still leaves some room for questions. Like, do I just show up and wait? Is he just expecting we both show whenever after work? It's weird, any other date I have been on, the guy has finalized a time and texted me the morning of at some point or another. Maybe he will text closer to the time this afternoon? My fear is I am going to be blown off and wasted re-arranging my evening schedule for no reason. I could just be used to different communication styles in the past, but I don't know....this seems....off? And before anyone says it, no, I do not want to text first again today. If he is interested or wants to make sure, he will message me. It takes two seconds to send a text. He could simply just not be a big texter, but is this a red flag for someone who asked for a second chance and made the plans? ",1,1739378818.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False

I'll keep this short and succint.

  
Met wonderful girl last year in May. We really hit things off and felt great together. We currently live together.

  
I had some things completely beyond my control ruin our Christmas Eve( I was stuck in an airport for over 14 hours and ended up spending Christmas Eve by myself in a hotel and then coming back on Christmas Day) together as well as Thanksgiving (we had to spend separately due to different families).

  
I figured I'd plan an awesome romantic Valentine's Day weekend with a lot of fun things.

  
Two days ago she tells me that she's leaving for Philadelphia for the Eagles celebration parade and will be back on Sunday night.

  
To me, this is a retribution to what happened on Xmas.  I will add that she has spent more time and effort planning this trip and the subsequent partying in the streets and bar crawl and spending quite a bit of money to do so.

This also brings me to my somewhat resentment of paying ALL  the bills.  A beautiful condo to live in( she  moved into my place).  All our meals/trips/dining out.  (about $2-4k/mo) Never once has she opened up her wallet to pay for anything or to offer other than a coffee or cheap lunch and definitely never offered to split living costs.

  
I feel like I'm being taken advantage of and this latest slight to me and the relationship is like a dagger in my back.  Everything I posted above, to me, show me her commitment level to the relationship, which isn't much.  She doesn't do anything domestic(I do everything anyway).  Doesn't buy me gifts(dont need/want).

 Honestly I feel like packing her things while she is gone. 

What is everyones advice on how to proceed?

One small problem is that one of my walls is basically paper thin (but my bedroom is on a corner, and super quiet). Another small problem is that I live next to a super grouchy neurodivergent 37-year-old man. He's grouchy because when I see him in the lobby and try to be nice and say 'hello,' he just grunts at me. And he just generally is not having it with people around him. Neighbors are always like, ""Do you live next to..."" and then we just both shrug and change the subject.  I do know that he's neurodivergent (not guessing) because he just has tell-tale signs  (slack jaw, dragging right foot) and my neighbor who has lived in the building since the 90s, knows his mother and confirmed (*she doesn't know what it is exactly, but ""it's something.""*)

Speaking of his mom, the walls are so thin, I can hear his conversation clearly when he talks to her on the phone (when he's in his bedroom) from where I sit on my sofa. She's doing great and lives in Queens and always suggests that my neighbor should spend more time with his cousins.

I also know that he plays with animé toys because he throws the old toys in the recycling bin when he gets bored of them—playing cards, little toy figures with capes and movable arms,  and I also can see a sliver of his bedroom wall which has one of those red and white cat-animé masks displayed.

When he's playing with his toys, he uses a vocoder to turn his voice into a monster voice and he says things like, ""I need to sacrifice humanity, and I need all their blood..."" or ""humanity must be DESTROYED!""  in one of those Japanese vampire voices—then he stomps around his bedroom which basically makes the things on my coffee table clink and clank. I know it's a vocoder because I saw the old one in the recycling bin just after Christmas, so someone got him an upgrade. I do a lot of snooping in the recycling bin as you can tell.

Anyway, every week or every two weeks, he goes BONKERS. Like he just loses his shit and gets into these serious fits of rage (like genuine non-animé rage) and he starts screaming, sometimes it sounds like he's being hacked to death, sometimes it's something simple like, ""I hate this fucking recipe!"" or ""Fuck off mom, you are so STOOOOO-pid!"" and then I'll hear something being thrown, which then makes all the dogs on our floor go crazy, they start yelping and they start howling, there are six dogs, so it's instant kennel-central.

I've had enough, and I noticed that when I play Lady Gaga with the bass at around 99% at 50% volume (enough to make the reflection in the mirror blur a little), within seconds, he comes storming out of his apartment, huffs and puffs and says, ""GAWWWWWD! FUCCKKKK!"" but then slams the door and takes his business to the other room (his living room because I had to know the floor plan from StreetEasy). And there he remains quiet for the rest of the day and evening. It only takes  a few verses I've noticed. I think he just needs to know that someone is home next door to him, maybe he forgets I'm here. But it has worked for over a year, and I only have to do it maybe every 6-8 days.

The rent is great, obviously, but I'm looking forward to the day I don't have to deal with this. I really hate this city sometimes, no matter where you live, there's always something fucked up about it. I feel better now that I've shared this confession.",1,1739378759.0,confessions,0,1.0,False
1invbal,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1invbal/classmate_did_my_nails_i_took_them_off_two_days/,"Classmate did my nails, i took them off two days later. Aitah?","I don’t know if this is the right place to post but here I go! This is gonna be a long one to get in all the details, sorry in advance! 

So I’m in cosmetology school and part of that is nails. I have a classmate who I used to talk with regularly, hang out on lunch, add each other on all social media and even talked about hanging outside of school. So I thought we were friends. Her main interest in cosmetology school is nails. She offered to do my nails when she got the supplies with no mention of paying her. This is important for later. 

Due to my mental health, I ended up having to take a two month long break. During that break, she hit me up a couple times asking me if I was OK and when I was gonna come back to school, which is something that friends do. I end up going back to school in September of last year and she seems excited and said she’s happy that I came back . She mentioned doing my nails again because she now has all the things she needs. I said hell, yeah let’s do it. We decide to do my nails on a Friday.

All week long she is doing other girls nails and has even done a couple of the girls’s nails two or three times by this point that I’ve come back to school. I did not once, see or hear anything about any of the girls paying her. I thought she was doing nails for them because she was friends with them and wanted to practice because she was a beginner nail artist. And just be minded as a student you’re not allowed to charge for your services especially if it’s happening inside the school, which all this did.

It gets to the Friday that we’re doing my nails and she unexpectedly does another girl‘s nails first which is fine so we start on my nails a little bit before 12 o’clock. She told me she wanted to do some Halloween nails and I said I didn’t really want any festive nails, but she really wanted to do the Halloween nails because it was october (she had done several Halloween nail sets already.) a couple days before, I had mentioned that I wanted a hello Kitty inspired nail set so she showed me a hello Kitty zombie set and I thought it was cute so I agreed to do it. We also decided that I was going to choose duck nails. (if you don’t know what duck nails are it’s just the shape of the nail. They flare out at the end so it’s wider at the end of the nail.) i’d never had that shape before so I didn’t know what I was getting myself into. I also haven’t had my nails done very often and I keep my natural nails pretty short most of the time, so I told her I wanted the nails to be shorter. Well, she didn’t really listen…

It gets to my turn to get my nails done and she’s not really paying attention to me or the nails. She’s talking to a bunch of the other girls, which I get, so I didn’t say anything. But it got to the point that she would stop doing my nails for a few minutes at a time pretty often . I was starting to get annoyed, but I’m non-confrontational so I didn’t say anything to her and kinda just wanted this to get over with.

It ended up taking four hours to get the nails done. And they were cute at a glance, but some of the nails were lumpy and some of the gel polish didn’t cure by the time she said the nails were done. (I realized this later on) but like I said before she was a beginner nail tech so I wasn’t judging too hard. I was just happy to have my nails done and they were overall cute. We finished the nails at the very end of the school day.

I go home with these nails and very quickly figure out I can’t close my fingers all the way because of the shape. And maybe that’s my bad because I guess maybe I should’ve known that it would be like that because I picked that shape. But then I also found out I can’t wipe myself correctly when I go to the bathroom because of how long the nails are. And because of how long they are, it hurts my fingers and my Coochie. Sorry if that’s TMI but it’s true! And I go to the bathroom a lot because I drink a lot of water and a lot of coffee, so it was just uncomfortable over the next two days. I also started to get worried that I would have a hard time with the nails at work. I work in fast food and I have to open the bags of frozen food and the plastic on them is pretty thick and I didn’t think I would be able to break through the plastic with the shape of nail. So two days after she put the nails on, I decided I needed to take them off.

I went to school the next day and waited a couple hours. I was nervous to tell her I wanted to take the nails off because I’ve seen her get angry about things that weren’t really a big deal. But I needed to take the nails off. So I went to her anyway and sheepishly told her I wanted to take them off and told her all of my reasoning, and being sure to tell her I’m sorry, and I do actually like the nails. Which I did. Her demeanor immediately soured. She started to raise her voice and say that I wasted her time and her product and now I needed to pay her. I agreed to it because I was genuinely scared. I have bad PTSD and anxiety from a past relationship that had a lot of yelling that turned into violence often. But I was stressed out because I was broke. I am disabled and I live off of disability and two days a week at a fast food job. I had just paid all my monthly bills and I had nothing left. I had negative money in my account. So I didn’t know how I was going to pay her. But either way, I told her that I had no money right now but as soon as I got it, I would pay her.

She told me she wasn’t going to take the nails off and to just deal with it, not in those words. I ended up finding another girl that was willing to take them off for me. 

I went home and talked to my sister, Dad, and the next day, another classmate about the situation and they all agreed that I shouldn’t have to pay her because she didn’t ask me to pay her beforehand and none of the other girls paid her as well as she was also just being rude . And I thought the same. And this is cosmetology and nail school. Girls are constantly doing each other‘s nails and hair for free. So I thought it was that kind of situation, also because we were friends.

BUT, I am an artist. I like to draw pretty women. In a stylized cartoon way. So before she had even started doing my nails I had started a drawing for her, like I had for other classmates. But I didn’t say anything because I wanted it to be a surprise. Even though I thought she overreacted and was being mean to me, I still wanted to finish her drawing because I was almost done with it, and I planned on giving it to her anyway. I spend a lot of time on my drawings. Sketching and coloring/ blending the colored pencil so the drawing looks smooth. I use prismacolor colored pencils, and any traditional artists may know,  they’re pretty expensive. I also was drawing hands and a sword, so my fellow artist might also know that it’s kinda hard to draw hands, and it’s kinda hard to draw a straight line when you don’t own a ruler, which I don’t hahaha. So I spent a lot of time on the drawing, but I did have fun like I always do when I’m creating.

The next week I brought the drawing to school and gave it to her and she loved it. She then asked me to draw another picture of her with a couple specifications but poster size because I have the paper for that. I agree because I still felt bad about the situation. At this point I also told her that I have the money to give her now and she said “just send me $10 for supplies I overreacted anyway.” so I did.

So I spent the next couple days working on a poster size drawing. It probably took me 7 to 8 hours of drawing and coloring to finish it, and I also spent three hours on the first drawing. I brought it to school and she loved it. But she has refused to talk to me or look in my direction since the day, I told her I wanted to take the nails off… It just hurts my feelings because I thought that we were friends before this happened. But maybe I can’t expect a classmate to stay friends with me after I was gone for two months. 

Also a couple days after I wanted to take the nails off she started posting on Snapchat about how she “does nails to make money and no other reason.” Be minded that she has a pattern of getting angry and yelling with other classmates and threatening physical violence because of something that doesn’t seem like that big of a deal, to me at least. So I kind of decided that I didn’t wanna be friends with her anyway.

Now I thought that 10 to 11 hours of my time, two drawings, my skills, and my expensive colored pencils would be worth a fair trade, as well as $10. But she still refuses to even look my direction unless I’m directly speaking to her and asking her a question, and it’s been four months by the time I’m writing this.  

Here’s where I think I might be the a hole. My other classmates have started to develop their skills and make nail sets and bring outside activities like crocheting to school and have been charging for their services. And people have been buying things from them. I’m feeling like maybe I should have just sucked it up and paid her the full amount that she wanted. But we never discussed me paying her beforehand like in these situations with my other classmates. She only said I had to pay her after I wanted to take the nails off. The drawings that I did for her took well over the four hours it took her to do my nails by almost triple. 

Just another example of a skill trade, one of the aestheticians gave me a facial, and I put tooth gems on her teeth for her. So that was another reason I thought a skilled trade would suffice. And this has been a while ago, but she still acts that way towards me and I’ve been thinking about it because I’ve been overly anxious and paranoid lately due to mental health. I tend to overthink every possible situation I have ever been in lol. 

So am I the ahole for expecting free nails when my other classmates aren’t and have not done free nails or other services? (Some girls still do hair for free) I know some artists like doing skill trades and maybe she’s just not the type of person to do a trade, but am I the ahole for expecting a trade to be OK/ free service? 

Sorry this is so long!😫 I just wanted to give you all the details. Thanks for reading!

Update from previous question, issue still not solved...

I own a Nespresso Latissima Touch. There are now seemingly two issues. 

Issue 1) There is normal Water flowing through the Coffee Part of it as long as there is no Pod. Once there is a Pod, some coffee comes out, but only a very small amount. 

Issue 2) After every usage, the bottom left compartment (Refer to picture), fills up with water. It's a pull-out compartment to put your cup on top of, as far as I know, it ain't supposed to fill up with water.

I took off the top and looked at the wiring and it all looks like it's from day 1 as far as I can tell. Nothing is loose, detached, corroded, etc. I'm at an absolute loss as to why the PID worked perfectly on Sunday and then does not today when it's just been sitting for three days untouched.

On the surface, the family’s new Saturday morning breakfast routine wasn’t much different than our old one, other than me cooking more food than usual, and the extra place-setting at the head of the table.

But the new normal consisted of far more than mere logistic changes. Cody’s aura permeated every nook and cranny of our home, and I couldn’t rub his scent out of my nostrils. The bare spot on the living room wall where the folded American flag had once hung was a testament to how much had changed in our household.

As the family gathered in the dining room while I cooked the morning meal, I questioned my sanity for agreeing to such a demoralizing arrangement. But because the alternative would’ve been to divorce Liz and lose her forever, I renewed my vow to deal with it the best I could.

From my vantage point in the kitchen, I could see Liz and Cody amble down the stairs and take their seats at the dining room table, where their daughters were sipping orange juice and scrolling through their phones.

Mia looked up at her parents and smirked. “Dang, you two, could you have made any more noise last night?”

Liz grimaced. “I’m sorry, little princess; did we disturb you?”

Cody laughed and shot me a smug look from the next room over. Everyone turned to glance my way; I pretended I wasn’t listening, focusing my gaze on the pan while stirring the hashbrowns with a vengeance.

Brooke, always the empathetic one, changed the subject.

“Hey, Dad, if you’re not busy, I’ve got a riding lesson at 3 today; maybe you’d like to come see me practice,” she said. “I’m pretty good.”

Mia made a face. “’I’m pretty good,'” she mimicked. “You’ve only got three more ribbons than me.”

“Yeah, but they’re all first place.”

“And you’re two whole years older!”

“Okay, you two, cut it out,” Liz said in an authoritative voice while chuckling at the same time. She started to take a sip of coffee but when she lifted the cup, she frowned. “Walter, come here, please,” she called.

I turned down the flame on the stove and ventured into the dining room. “What’s up, hon—” I stopped myself from calling my wife honey, per Cody’s Rule Number 3. “Um, what’s up?”

With a grimace, Liz presented the cup. A small hair floated on the coffee’s surface.

“That’s nasty, Walter.”

“Oh, crap, I’m sorry, let me get you another one.”

“That’s not being a very good maid, Walter,” Cody said in a jokey voice.

Everyone laughed.

I sidestepped the barb, scooped up Liz’s cup and scurried to the kitchen.

After I replaced my wife’s coffee, I finished preparing the morning meal, and started bringing the platters of food to the dining room.

Cody rubbed his hands together when I set down the plate of ham. “Mm, looks good, Walt!”

I thanked him, even though I could tell by his inflection that his “compliment” was meant to demean me. Or maybe, I thought, it was just my imagination.

During the meal, Brooke resumed pestering her father.

“Can you PLEASE come see me ride? Please??”

“Honey, I’d love to see you and your sister ride your horses, and I can’t wait until I can … but I’ve got a two o’clock appointment today.”

“Today? With who?”

Cody shifted in his seat. “Um, the psychiatrist.”

“Psychiatrist? Why are you seeing a …?” Brooke shut up when the answer to her unfinished question dawned on her. “Oh … sorry, Dad.”

“It’s fine, honey. And I’m fine. It’s protocol; all the POWs have to get counseling for a year. I swear, I’m not crazy!”

“Well, you sounded pretty crazy last night,” Mia quipped.

“Stop that!” Liz scowled at her youngest daughter before glancing at me. “Sorry, Walt.”

“It’s okay, honey,” I said, and then immediately realized I’d violated Cody’s rule by using the “H” word.

I peeked over at the larger man; he shook his head with an amused smirk before wiping his mouth with a napkin. “You know, since the subject’s been brought up, maybe we should get this all out in the open as a family,” he said. “Your mom and me are going to be intimate together, and it’s obviously an awkward situation with both Walter and me living here.”

“I thought Walt agreed to step aside.” Mia twisted her hair.

“Well, he did, sweetheart, but it’s still probably going to be confusing for everyone for a while,” Liz said.

“It IS confusing.” Brooke stabbed at her eggs with her fork. “Everything’s different now.”

“Yeah, it is.” Mia sniggered and looked at her mom. “It’s WAY different — you never made those noises with Walt.”

Liz started to admonish her brat of a daughter, but when Cody guffawed, she joined him, and then sent a sympathetic glance my way. “I’m sorry, Walter, she’s just joking — you know how she is. Are you okay?”

I nodded, unable to eke out a verbal response.

“Listen, all joking aside, this IS confusing for everyone,” Cody said, reaching over and touching Brooke’s hand. “For me, too. Like you said, the whole world is different, and sometimes it seems like I don’t even know which way is up. The only thing I DO know is that I love you girls and your mom more than anything in the world. You guys are all I thought about when I was …” He let the sentence trail off.

The new head of the household sat up straight in his chair. “So, now that I’ve got a second chance to have my girls back, we ARE going to make this work out somehow. Right, Walter?”

“Um, well, yeah.”

“Why don’t you tell everyone how YOU feel about this whole situation?” The tone of Cody’s voice told me he wasn’t asking; it was an order — an order clearly meant to put me on the spot.

“I … well, er, um, like I told you girls before, I love your mom, but our love has always been more like … a … a brother and sister,” I lied. “So, when your father was rescued, I knew your mom’s heart would always be with him. I love her in my own way, but I can never give her what your father gives her. He’s your guys’ dad, and he never got the chance to connect with you. And now, fate has given him a second chance with his family. Who would I be to stand in the way of that?”

“I gotta tell you, Walt: That’s awfully big of you,” Cody said, while the rest of the family nodded in agreement.

Several seconds ticked by before Mia broke the uncomfortable silence. “Hey, Walt?”

“Yeah, honey?”

“Can I have some more orange juice?”

“S-sure, honey.”

As I stood to fetch my stepdaughter’s refill, Cody leaned back in his chair and sucked his teeth.

“Looks like some things haven’t changed around here,” he said with an impish glance at Liz. “Walt’s still the maid.”

Everyone cracked up as I donned my magnanimous “I’m-okay-with-being-the-butt-of-the-joke” smile and trooped toward the kitchen.",7,1739377976.0,cuck_femdom_tales,1,0.9,False

1inuzek,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1inuzek/thoughts_on_my_situation/,Thoughts on my situation?,"Hi!, I am a freshman in college (19,)and was talking to a junior(21) in college. We met in October 2024(I was 18 when we met) . The first night we met we stayed up talking till 4am about everything. At the time I was not ready for a relationship because I just got dumped before starting college, and I told him that. And he seemed to be okay with it. (he still took me on dates and treated me well) He wanted to have sex with me, but I kept telling him no, but he kept trying anyway. I eventually gave in after hanging out 3 times by ourselves, and I didnt feel very good about it. Anyway, in November he ended things and said that he ""still has urges to meet other women"" and being ""free"" I was obviously sad and heart broken, He left me literally 30 minutes after we had...yk.. and I was in a vulnerable position. A day goes by, he texts me asking if we can talk. I say yes. And we get back together because he said he wanted a relationship with me and genuinely wanted to try. Everything was fine after, we went on dates, he bought me coffee, etc. Then, christmas break starts and were apart, which was good until the last week of it when he told me that he doesnt want a relationship with me, but still wanted to hangout. So, I ended things because I wasnt gonna be a booty call to him. A couple days later, I felt bad because I had said some pretty hurtful things to him so I apologized. Then we got back together. Fast forward a week, we went on a date and he was 15 minutes late. I was in a bad mood, and then I found out he didnt even have my number saved. So then I was in an even worse mood. He wanted to play ping pong so I said okay, and we went to go play it. 30 minutes go by and hes purposefully hitting the balls super hard and making it so I cant hit it. I get frustrated and say I didnt wanna play anymore so we leave. He comes back into my dorm and he ends things with me again. This time saying that he wanted someone who was happy, and that if i was happier to see him then he wouldnt have been ending things with me. He then said he wanted a relationship, just not with me because Im ""not optimistic"" and ""walk with my head down"" Firstly, I was in a bad mood because he was late and also it was cold and the air was literally blowing in my face. Now, a couple days later I looked at his insta and he already has several girls in his following, all  being freshman. He has a track record of being a man whore, but I just didnt think he would move on that fast after us being together for 4 months.

Relevant information: Hes a mega trump supporter and I am NOT. He did the hiel hitler to me several time, and when i told him to get the fuck out my room if hes a nazi, he told me to relax and it 'wasnt what he meant' (Because he was doing what elon musk did). Even after me explaining my dislike of it he still kept doing it even when i was upset about it. Additonally, he kept sending me political things on instagram, even after i voiced my dislike of him doing that, because I dont like to argue about politics because in my opinion, it shouldnt be the basis of a relationship . He also told me he wanted someone who would back him up no matter if he was wrong or not, and I told him I dont do that for anyone. In addition, when we were on our little break he told me he fucked another girl 3 days later. ( a freshman girl ) But he said he didnt talk to her anymore so, obviously i believed him and took him back. also, when we were walking to my dorm hall one day he said he felt predatory because he was going to a freshman dorm. Also, I would make it clear I didnt wanna have sex when we hung out, but every time we ended up doing it because he kept trying and pushing himself on me.

I recognize all the red flags I ignored, but I genuinely would like to know someones opinion. from outside my friend circle. Im still super hurt, and seeing him moving on so fast to MORE freshman girls is just hurting me more. Any thoughts, opinions or advice?",2,1739377910.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I looked around, I was in a living room, and I didn’t seem to be in any immediate danger. What do I remember? Let me start at the basics, my name is Gerald Graham, my job is… um… I live at… um… This isn’t a good start. Where am I anyway, and how did I get here? I’m in a living room, is this my house? If it is this is a nice place. I looked out the window, I was on the second floor of the house.

 

The house had a massive garden surrounded by three-metre-high walls. It seemed to be night, near the window was a grandfather clock, it was eleven past nine. I realised I was holding something; it was a vial of Lacocelex. What is Lacocelex again? I think it’s that new experimental drug meant to lessen some of the symptoms of heart disease, though in overuse it can have the side effect of temporary memory loss. Wait… How the hell do I know all that?

 

I peered into the vial, it was empty. Why would I consume a whole vial of heart disease medicine? Do I have heart disease? I think I would know if I did. To be fair I don’t even know what my job is, if I even have a job. I suppose I should just wait until the effects of the Lacocelex were off. Patients usually regain memory after about an hour. How do I know that!? Okay, I need to remain calm; this is a nice place!

 

A nice cozy modern living room. I guess I could watch television until I figure it out. I sat down on the surprisingly comfortable couch and turned it on. It seems I recorded the recent soccer match to watch. I don’t like soccer that much, so I’ll probably watch something else. Wait… why would I record a soccer match if I don’t like soccer? Do I like soccer? I should watch it in case I do. I started watching the match, which team do I support again? I suppose I’ll remember in due time.

 

I watched the game for a few minutes, not particularly enjoying myself. Suddenly I heard a loud shattering noise from the bottom floor. Fear shot through me; someone was breaking into my house. Was there a weapon here? How could I defend myself? I grabbed a nearby chair, I suppose it could do. I heard another sound, like a door opening. I cautiously stepped down the stairs equipped with my chair. I walked into the house’s kitchen. I saw a short, masked man looking around the house. I dropped the chair when I saw they had a gun. I froze and raised my hands.

 

“Hey!” I said in shock. They aimed it at my face.

 

“Listen you can take what you want,” I pleaded desperately. The gun started shaking in their hands, they were looking into my eyes.

 

“Take what you want, please,” I begged. They diverted their eyes. If I could remember more of my life, it would probably all flash in front of my eyes now. All I could now recall about my life was my ever-present paralysing fear of death. A fear I knew was always there and now was right in front of me.

 

“Please,” I said finally. They closed their eyes; the gun was wildly shaking. In a single instant, I heard the gunshot, felt a quick stabbing pain in my forehead and saw the smoke emerge from the barrel, a moment later everything went dark. I felt this cold wash over my body, like a freezing shower. Before I could even process the numbing coldness consuming my body, I awoke with a start. Again, I felt like I was choking on something. I looked around, I was again in the living room on the top floor. I grabbed my chest; my heart was pounding. My body no longer felt numb. I felt my forehead, it felt perfectly intact. I swear just a moment ago I felt the bullet pierce my skin.

 

I stood up, it had to be a vivid dream, right? I looked around, everything looked the same as it did in my ‘dream’. If I was dreaming, I should remember everything now, right? No… I still don’t remember a thing, just my name, that’s all. The paradox of what happened overwhelmed me, I couldn’t’ve been shot, else why would I still be alive now? Yet I can’t shake how vivid it all was. I can practically still hear the shot, feel the pain and sense that numbness. I saw the same grandfather clock from earlier. It read eleven past nine, just like in my dream. It had to be a dream; it had to be. I once again sat on the couch. I switched on the TV again, like the last time I saw the soccer game I had recorded.

 

While I still don’t remember much about soccer, I know that this game was the same as it was in my dream. While I slowly began noticing all the similarities between this game and the one in my dream, anxiety slowly built up inside of me, the type of anxiety that I imagine someone would experience if they encountered a ghost or any other paranormal experience. Had I peered into the future? No! That’s ridiculous! I’m a man of logic, not superstition! Yet logic cannot explain how vivid that dream was, and why everything is the exact same as it was in the dream.

 

I heard a noise downstairs, the same one as earlier. Whether what I experienced was a dream, or precognition or whatever, I should’ve heeded its warning. I stood up to run. When I reached the stairs, I saw the masked robber waiting for me at the bottom. I turned to run. Seeing no better option now I suppose my best option is to escape from the window. When I reached the window, I looked back to see the robber walking towards me, eyes closed and gun shaking wildly. I closed my eyes in turn. What would my last thought be? Regret, probably regret.

 

I heard the gunshot, felt the flash of pain and once again felt cold envelope me. I awoke with a start. I immediately stood up and walked to the grandfather clock, like the last two times it displayed eleven past nine. I took a deep breath, I had just had two ultra-realistic experiences of death, too realistic to chalk up to dreaming. I must face the possibility that I was in some kind of a time loop. If that’s true then that means that there is a robber on his way, and I must get out of here now. I set off downstairs. The last time I was here I didn’t even realise it was the kitchen and dining room. Next to the dining room table was a large whiteboard I also hadn’t noticed.

 

The whiteboard had some kind of technical drawing on it. There was a large circle barely enveloping a ring of evenly spaced smaller circles. There was also a horizontal line protruding from the bottom of the large circle. The large circle was labelled “2” with the smaller ones being labelled “1”. Was this something I was working on before I lost my memory? I had no clue what it could be. Below the whiteboard was a strange electronic ball, I picked it up. It seemed to be homemade and very cobbled together. It had a green light attached to it as well as three buttons labelled “1”, “2” and “X”. Again, I had no clue what this was. I realised that there was still a robber on their way.

 

I tried to open the front door, though it was locked. Where are the keys? I went to the kitchen to look for them. I have no clue where they could be. While checking one of the countertops I accidentally knocked over a coffee mug which was there. I don’t have time to clean that up now. I stopped searching for a moment. I know that a dangerous robber is going to break into the house at any moment. I can’t waste my time searching for the keys. I must get out of here now. I saw that there was a massive window next to the kitchen, I picked up a nearby chair and threw it through the window.

 

I hoped through, accidentally cutting my leg on the broken glass while I did. It hurt a lot. I limped around the house searching for my car. Do I even own a car? If I do where are the keys? I saw my car parked near the front door. Suddenly I saw the gate open and a car drive through. That had to be them. I ran away, swallowing the immense pain in my leg. I tripped and fell into the grass. I heard the car stop and the door open. Along with the visceral fear of knowing an armed man was approaching, I also felt this indescribable… hope. I have no clue how my current situation can elicit hope but, that’s how I feel. I heard a gun load.

 

“Not this time…” I barely heard the criminal whisper. I heard the gunshot, felt the pain, felt the cold and as always awoke with a start. As someone who has died thrice already, I can tell you that the feeling isn’t good. A part of me however did feel relieved that I awoke again. I walked downstairs. I saw the window and coffee mug both as they were before I smashed them. There is no dispute that I’m in a time loop, one that resets at my death and one that’s only constant is my consciousness. I thought of the bullet which had pierced my brain several times before. Whatever mechanism reconstructs everything each time the loop resets must also reset the Lacocelex in my brain. This means I can only remember anything if I manage to survive long enough to have its effects wear off.

 

I broke the window again, this time making sure not to cut my leg again on my way out. I looked at the walls surrounding the house. Could I climb over them? I also noticed the large main gate. If I could just find the keys, I could exit through there! I noticed a tall tree near the wall. I’m going to try to climb it and jump over the wall. Only once I reached the top of the tree did I realise that there was a wall-top electric fence covering the whole perimeter. I must value security huh?

 

Thinking of the encroaching criminal made me realise that I had to make a choice now. Thinking of no better option I leapt from the tree. The moment I hit the fence a shocking pain covered my entire body. I let go and fell backwards, still reeling from the pain while I fell. When I hit the ground, the pain disappeared and was replaced by the cold numbness. I awoke with a start. I stood up and kicked a nearby table angrily. An empty glass bottle which stood on the table fell to the ground and shattered. Why can’t I remember a thing? Why of all times must a robber break in now? Why can’t I find the damn key? And why oh why am I trapped in this time loop!?

 

My house was beginning to feel more and more like a prison with each successive loop. Wait… prison… police… I should just call the police! I felt my phone in my pocket and took it out. I dialled the emergency services.

 

“911 what’s your emergency?” the voice on the other end asked.

 

“This may sound strange, but I think my house is about to be broken into,” I said.

 

“What is your current location?”  
  
That would just be my house address, wait…

 

“Hold on…” I said.

 

I went into my phone’s map app. No Wi-Fi. Strange but I just turned my data on. When I finally found my address, I just read it to them.

 

“All right sir we should have someone there in about ten minutes,” they said. I looked at the clock, it was a quarter past nine, and the robber was going to be here in about five minutes.

 

“That’s just great,” I said before angrily hanging up. Now what? I looked out the window at the main gate. If the robber arriving is inevitable, and they’re repeatedly going to come through the gate, can’t I just run out the gate when they get here? I went downstairs and broke open the window. While I walked to the gate, I thought about how alone I currently was. It’s late at night and from the map, I could tell I live in a remote location. I’m the only one trapped in this loop as far as I can tell, and I don’t even have my memories to keep me company. A disturbing thought crossed my mind, if my consciousness is the only constant through the loop then wouldn’t that mean that all the other people are forced to do the same thing repeatedly?  
  
The only one who could change their actions is the robber since they interact with me, but they wouldn’t even realise that. What about all the people who are forced to relive the last ten minutes over and over without even realising? The gate opened. I ran out past the car. The car stopped and quickly reversed. Suddenly it swerved to the side hitting me from behind. The sheer momentum knocked me to the ground. I knew I was about to pass out, if not worse. I faintly heard a car door open before being consumed by cold and waking with a start.

 

Was the car hitting me from behind really enough to kill me? Maybe I just passed out and the robber did the rest? What else could I do? The first time around I froze, then I fled, now let me try to fight. I went to the kitchen. I found two kitchen knives. I decided to keep looking for the gate’s keys. When I heard the gate open in the distance I grabbed the two knives.

 

When they opened the door, I charged at them. Before I could reach them, they promptly gunned me down. The last thing I saw was their shocked expression. After I woke up again, I started laughing. I guess that old saying about a knife and a gunfight is true. What do I do now? I don’t have to rush to do anything. It’s strangely reassuring to know that no matter what happens to me I’ll wake up again. I suppose I could relax a little before trying to do anything else. My biggest priorities are still to escape this house and to figure out how I ended up in this loop, but I don’t have to rush.

 

Wait… why do I feel like this? Shouldn’t being trapped in a house destined to always be robbed be a terrifying scenario? Why am I not that scared anymore? I suppose the loop gives me certainty. At the start, it was scary and frustrating, but I guess the certainty of what comes next, and the certainty of my waking up again takes away the pressure. If a task is something important but not urgent then it ceases to induce stress.

 

I noticed something strange next to the table in the room. A glass bottle was on the floor shattered with its top in pieces, but the bottom was still intact. I remembered with horror how I had kicked this table two loops back in frustration. For some reason, this bottle remained constant throughout the loops resetting. Why could that be? I don’t even know why there is a loop in the first place, so there can’t be any way for me to figure out what’s special about this bottle.

 

If this bottle is a constant what else could be? The mug I smashed downstairs in a similar fashion reset, same with the window as well. The robber must also reset, since if he could remember previous loops why does he keep trying to kill me? I looked at the grandfather clock, it read twelve past nine, clearly the entire dimension of time resets as well. Hell, even my body and brain reset, no matter what fatal injury I experience I still wake up fully healthy each time. Even when I’m shot in the head my brain resets.

 

I stared down at the broken bottle in my hand. Something was special about it and my consciousness. Something that allows both of us to remain constant through this strange anomaly. I dropped the bottle. It smashed into even more pieces on the floor. I walked downstairs to the kitchen; I had to clear my mind. I realised that I was quite hungry, not hungry enough to eat any of the previous loops but still hungry. I opened the fridge to see a closed bag of chocolate muffins. I tried one of them… it was delicious! It had this amazing peanut butter in the centre. I immediately began eating the other muffins.

 

I was delighted that I would still be able to eat more of these muffins since they would presumably reset with the loop. I sat down on one of the chairs to wait for the robber. Strangely, I was waiting for this dangerous criminal about as casually as I would for a doctor or dentist. Huh, both my examples of waiting are medical. Weird.

 

I felt an itch in my neck. I coughed to try to relieve the itch. I realised that it was beginning to get difficult to breathe. I hadn’t been like this on the previous loops. What changed? I realised that there was only one thing it could be. The muffins. I began desperately searching for my Epinephrine injector, which I must have somewhere. As my breathing continued to become more and more difficult, the unpleasant feeling became more and more familiar.

 

I suppose it makes sense why this feeling is familiar. It’s just frustrating that I didn’t remember that I had this allergy in the first place. Why does this horrible feeling feel familiar, but my house doesn’t? I suppose the allergy has been with me longer. I ran into the bathroom, desperate just to find anything to make the reaction go away. With every passing second, I became more desperate while it was also becoming increasingly difficult to quell that desperation with it becoming more and more difficult to breathe.

 

I heard the front door open; I suppose this was one way of stopping the reaction. I walked out of the bathroom; I saw the now familiar robber aiming the trembling gun at me. As the cold enveloped me the itching in my neck vanished. I awoke with a start feeling relieved that it was over. Unfortunately, I can’t eat those delicious muffins (or any other product with peanuts in them) again. Well, I can still eat them if I get a real craving, death is after all just an inconvenience now.

 

I saw the bottle from earlier smashed into many more pieces, just like it was in the previous loop. This simple bottle might be essential to figuring out how I got into this situation, yet I don’t even have the beginning of a plan of how to unravel its secrets. What do I do now? I felt this stress to escape up until now but now I feel this… apathy? Perhaps that’s not the right word. The consistency of my continual renewal each time I ‘die’ has given me faith that I will continue evading death. I think I should relax for a moment. I have no rush after all. What other food is there downstairs? I’m hungry after all those muffins disappeared from my stomach.

 

I found a packet of two-minute noodles in the cupboard. After making them in the microwave, I sat on the couch opposite the front door. There was no point in hiding from my opponent. The noodles were delicious! When the robber walked through the door, I greedily took another bite before the bowl exploded in my hands. When I awoke, I smiled. I knew that I could just make myself the same packet again. However, the happiness of being able to eat the noodles again was being eclipsed by something else.

 

I felt this creeping feeling build inside of me, something I might’ve subconsciously felt during the last loop but ignored. I couldn’t quite place my finger on what it was, but I knew that I couldn’t relax, I had to escape this damn house. I ran downstairs and stood beside the door with my back to the wall to ensure he didn’t see me. I waited for the robber to arrive for a couple of tense minutes. When the door opened, I whipped around and punched him in the face, in response he promptly shot me in the chest. When I awoke again, I knew what to do.

 

I ran downstairs again and once again waited against the wall. When the door opened, I whipped around and first grabbed the gun then punched him in the face. We struggled for the gun, with him pushing me backwards back into the house. He headbutted me and I lost my grip on the gun. Before I could even regain control over the situation I had awoken on the floor on the top floor of the house.

 

I ran back downstairs and did everything exactly the same as I did last time. Except when he tried to headbutt me I dodged it and retaliated with a headbutt of my own. The gun went flying. I released his hand and looked around wildly for where it had landed. I heard it land behind me. When I turned around, I saw the robber bending down to pick it up. He quickly shot me, and I awoke again. No matter how many times I die the feeling of suffocating cold numbness enveloping me never gets any better.

 

Once again, I did everything exactly the same as my previous attempt except this time when I headbutted him I held out my hand to where I knew the gun would land. When I grabbed it, he ran towards me and quickly ripped it from my grasp. After he shot me, I awoke more frustrated than ever. I walked over to a mirror nearby and stared into it. Inside I saw a very familiar-looking man, I man whom I knew the name of, but little else.

 

A man whom I was trying to free, but I was failing. I thought of the creeping feeling I felt each time I was waiting for the robber to arrive. What is this feeling? Maybe… maybe I’m… Maybe I’m beginning to suspect that escape is impossible. Perhaps I’m forever doomed to try in vain to escape this house, only to fail forever. While this certainly is a disturbing thought, I don’t know if it properly explains my current mood.

 

An even more disturbing thought crossed my mind, one that I don’t think I dared to put into words, even in my mind, up until now. Perhaps… I don’t want to escape. Perhaps I don’t want to break the loop. I thought back to the very first time the robber broke into this house, and the paralysing, all-consuming fear which devoured me. I know that for almost my entire life, I had been bone-rattlingly afraid of death.

 

It was never really the physical pain of death which scared me. Sure, getting eaten by a shark or burning alive all sound unpleasant but what always unsettled me about the reaper was the permanence of it all. The pain I can deal with, but the idea of not existing anymore, forever, is indescribably terrifying for me. Now inside of this loop, I’m surrounded by death, since I die about every ten minutes, but I’m shielded from that permanence. Come to think of it, I’ve felt like I’ve always been surrounded by death during my regular life, this time however it’s my own death. Once again, I’m struggling to remember who I even am beyond the barest basics. The difference between death within and without the loop is that here, death isn’t permanent.

 

I again stared at the man in the mirror, the man contemplating whether or not to live inside of a time loop to escape permanent death. Even if I can’t decide what I want to do, I think I should at least try to escape, to give myself the choice. I mean, a prisoner in jail has no choice, while an escaped prisoner can choose to go back. Now what can I do differently in this loop?

 

Perhaps I set some sort of trap, right after I grabbed the gun, he runs towards me. Perhaps I could put something on the ground to ensure that that doesn’t happen. I ran downstairs. After looking through the cupboard I found some tape and a kitchen knife. I taped the kitchen knife on the spot on the ground in front of where I guessed he was going to start running. I waited next to the door like I had all the previous times.

 

I did everything the same as I did last time. Grab. Punch. Dodge. Headbutt. Catch. When he tried to run towards me, he noticed the knife and the ground and stopped. I triumphantly aimed the gun at him.

 

“Checkmate!” I shouted

 

“Wow, you must’ve been through the loop many times,” the robber said, removing his mask. He seemed more intrigued than scared.

 

“What!? You know about the time loop!?” I said incredulously.

 

“You look familiar, have we met before?” he asked.

 

“What do you know about the time loop!?” I demanded.

  
“Quite a lot I would say, after all, I did invent the device which generates it.”

 

“Are you serious?”

 

“Yes,” he said walking over to the whiteboard before picking up the mechanical ball which lay at its foot, “This device is what starts the time loops, resets the time loops, and decides what’s on what layer of the loop a particular object is,” he explained.

 

“And you invented that?”

 

“Yeah, I just said I did.”  
  
“What do you mean ‘layer of the loop’?”

 

He pointed at the small ring of circles on the diagram on the whiteboard, “These small circles represent layer one of the loops. Everything on layer one resets with the trigger event, which in this case I would assume to be…”  
  
“My death,” I said.

 

“Everything on layer two remains constant between the layer one loops resetting.”  
  
“So my body is on layer one and my consciousness on layer two?”

 

“Correct.”

 

“There’s a bottle upstairs which remains smashed even after I die.”  
  
“Then that bottle would be on layer two.”  
  
“Wait, why did you break into my house, and why is your invention here?” I demanded  
  
“What do you mean ‘my house’? This isn’t your house.”  
  
“Yes, it…” Wait… When I woke up, I just assumed that this had to be my house, but I had no proof that it was. “Whose house is it then?”  
  
“James’s, he’s a colleague of mine.”  
  
“Why are you breaking into his house?”  
  
“He stole my invention, and stole that whiteboard, I came here to try to steal them back.”

 

“Why would you kill me in the previous loops?”

 

“I suppose maybe I thought you were just his partner or co-conspirator.”

 

I couldn’t believe it; he’d kill me over that? I’ll push past it and try to find out more.

 

“Do you have any idea how I might’ve ended up in this situation?” I asked, “I just wake up each time with no memory of what happened before the loop started with a vial of heart disease medication.”

 

“I’m sorry, I honestly have no clue,” he replied, “Maybe we could figure it out together.”

 

Before I could scoff at what he was proposing he took a step forward and accidentally stepped on the upright knife. He howled in pain, falling to the floor.

 

“Reset the loop!” he shouted. I looked uncomfortably at the gun in my hands, there was only one way I could reset the loop. He seemed to notice what I was considering.

 

“Not like that!” he shouted, “Take the device and press the button with the one on it!” I picked up the cobbled-together ball.

 

“Wait,” he said, “My name is Rick, my favourite colour is green, and my childhood dog’s name was Lenny.”

 

“What?”

 

“Tell that to me next time you see me, so that I know we had this conversation.”

 

I pressed the button. The moment the button reached its lowest point I felt the usual cold envelope me before I awoke on the ground as usual. I did every single thing exactly the same as I did last time. When I aimed the gun at him, I cut off what he was about to say.

 

“Your name is Rick, your favourite colour is green, and your childhood dog’s name was Lenny,” I stated.

 

“Wow, what happened during the last loop?” Rick asked. I quickly caught him up on everything we had spoken about.

 

“So, we were trying to figure out how you ended up in the loop?” he asked.

 

“Yeah,” I said, “And you said I looked familiar, so you might know something about how I got here.”

 

He stared at me, trying his best to place me.

 

“Oh no…” he whispered.

 

“What?” I asked concerned.

 

“You can’t remember a thing about your life? Not one thing?”

 

I nodded.

 

“I’m a doctor,” he said, “I work at the local hospital.”

 

“Why would a doctor invent a time loop machine?” I asked sceptically.

 

“Do you have any idea how much a time loop machine would improve the medical industry? Anyways, I recognise you as a patient from that hospital, while I didn’t take your case, I did look at your file. This may not be easy to hear but… you have heart failure, and according to your file… it’s bad. You have…” he sighed, “A week, maybe two.”

 

I nearly dropped the gun. I thought of the medicine; it was so obvious all along. For all I know, I’m just as much a robber as Rick, I could’ve broken in here to relieve the medical debt I could have. Even if I break the time loop, I will still die, not even in a year, not even in a month. Without realising it I had been at the end of my life the entire time, the life I could remember nothing about, but that was nonetheless nearing its close. Even if I remain within the time loop, what kind of life will that be? Will I just spend a week in a hospital bed, forever?

 

I would do anything to forget what he had just told me, to go back to the ignorance which had graciously befallen me before. I had escaped, since I could of course easily just run away, but at what cost? Even if I leave this house, I will be doomed to return to it, forever. I am a prisoner who had just escaped into a larger, worse prison. I looked down at the spherical device which had both trapped me yet also shielded me from the truth, the truth that my life was now over. I picked it up and observed it.

 

“What would happen if I pressed the ‘2’ button here?” I asked.

 

“You don’t want to do that,” Rick said.

 

“What would happen?” I demanded.

 

“If you press that everything on both layers one and two will reset. That includes your consciousness. That means that if you press that button everything, from the first time you woke up to now, will happen exactly the same way, indefinably.”

 

My hand was hovering above the button. If I press it, I will forget everything, including the fact that I’m dying. If I don’t press it, I spend an uncountable number of weeks rotting away in a hospital bed until I probably choose to stop the loop and end it all. If I press it, I will at least have the illusion of a life to escape to, a mirage to keep me moving forward. I can either know my fate forever or forever be free of its burden. I made my choice. I could see Rick realised what I was about to do.

 

“NOOO!” he shouted while lunging forward, it was too late. I pressed the button. I felt the cold not only numb my body but also begin to wash away my memories, I surrendered to its freezing tranquillity.

 

I awoke with a start. I felt like I was choking on something. My face hurt like I was just hit. Where am I? I don’t remember a thing. Wait… I don’t remember a thing! Do I have amnesia? I looked around, I was in a living room, and I didn’t seem to be in any immediate danger. What do I remember? Let me start at the basics, my name is Gerald Graham, my job is… um… I live at… um… This isn’t a good start. Where am I anyway, and how did I get here? I’m in a living room, is this my house? If it is this is a nice place. I looked out the window, I was on the second floor of the house.

 

The house had a massive garden surrounded by three-metre-high walls. It seemed to be night, near the window was a grandfather clock, it was eleven past nine. I realised I was holding something; it was a vial of Lacocelex. What is Lacocelex again? I think it’s that new experimental drug meant to lessen some of the symptoms of heart disease, though in overuse it can have the side effect of temporary memory loss. Wait… How the hell do I know all that?

 

\--

 

Rick pulled into his parking space outside his house. He checked the time; it was one past nine. Rick was on a call.

 

“The last week has been rough,” he said, “I still can’t believe she’s gone. There is still so much I would’ve wanted to say to her.”  
  


He entered his home, “And guess what my boss told me today?” he said holding back tears, “Apparently, I took too much time off work to grieve. I’m fired, and I don’t think any other engineering firm would hire me… Yeah, I know that, it’s just I can’t afford a lawyer. I can’t even afford this house anymore, all our savings… well all my savings were spent on her medical expenses. I’m going to have to move. A month ago, I had a wife, I had a job, I had a house, I had a life!” he broke down crying.

 

“Thank you… Thank you… that means a lot…” Rick said to the person on the other end. He stared at the time loop device, “Unfortunately I can’t do that, I thought it was too risky to put her in a time loop, and now I’ll always regret that…”

 

He walked to his kitchen, taking out a mug to make himself coffee, “I know… I know…” he said, “I know I shouldn’t blame myself, but you know who I do blame!? That damn doctor! Dr. Gerald Graham! If he had noticed that she had heart failure earlier, she would’ve never died and I’d be pouring her a glass to drink right now… Yeah! It was his incompetence which ended her life… No, I already spoke with the police, they say that there is nothing I can do, but if you ask me that guy deserves to be thrown in jail! He ruined my life!”

 

Rick heard another call, “Hold on I’ll call you back, I’m getting another call.” He switched to the other call, “Hello, who is this?”

 

“Hey, it’s Dr. Graham. I came here to… apologise. I’m at your gate right now, please open it for me,” the voice on the other end said. Rick immediately grabbed his keys and pressed the button to open the gate. He watched out his window as he saw the car approach. Instinct taking over, Rick waited in front of the front door. When he heard the knock on the door, he immediately opened the door and punched Gerald in the face. Gerald fell to the ground. Rick stared down at his body, in shock at what he had just done.

 

He dragged Gerald inside. What should he do now? Could he blame some sort of crime on Gerald? The prospect of getting him locked up was appealing but he didn’t fancy his chances as an unemployed person vs a wealthy doctor. Rick remembered the gun he kept on his nightstand for self-defence, he shuddered, if there was one thing he would not do now, it was use that. The idea of permanently ending another’s life made him want to vomit. He looked down at Gerland in disgust, Gerald was the killer, not him.

 

Although, that gave him an idea. Perhaps he shouldn’t *permanently* end his life. He picked up the time loop device. He shined the green light it produced into Gerald’s eye. Gerald began regaining consciousness.

 

“What… who…” Gerald whispered. Rick pressed the button labelled ‘X’ on the spherical device. Gerald began horribly shaking, a moment later the light turned blue, and he stopped shaking, having passed out again. The device had just linked to his consciousness, ensuring that whenever it reset time the consciousness would remain constant until the second layer loop is reset. Rick dragged Gerald up the steps by the wrist, carrying the device in his other hand. It might be better to have him wake up on the top floor.

 

Rick noticed the vail of Lacocelex on his table, it was the medication his wife was taking near the end. He could remember how she would have temporary memory loss whenever she took it, it broke his heart that she would constantly forget who he was, before remembering once its effects wore off.

 

“You’ll spend an eternity not even knowing who you are,” Rick said, grabbing the Lacocelex and shoving a handful of its contents down Gerald’s throat. “The police won't trap you in jail, so I’m going to trap you in my prison of time. I may have to shoot you a couple of times, but you’ll be okay, you’ll wake up again.”  
  
Rick shuddered at the thought of having to shoot Gerald, he’d have to get it into his mind that what he was doing wouldn’t be permanent. “As the loops progress, you’ll probably get smart, you might even figure out what I’ve done to you. In that case, once I’ve felt like you’ve experienced enough loops, I’ll hit the ‘2’ button, and then everything will happen again, forever.”

 

A gleeful thought crossed Rick’s mind, he picked up Gerald’s hand and placed it on the device’s button labelled ‘2’. He pressed down. The device’s light flickered, and from now on all the loops would reset from this point, but since the only constant was Gerald’s consciousness and since he was still passed out, no change would occur between the loops until Gerald awoke.

 

“I think it would be great if you choose to press the button,” Rick said smiling, “I’ll have to figure out how to convince you to do that, but I think I can do it.” The idea that Gerald might willingly choose to trap himself made Rick’s revenge all the sweeter.

 

“Goodbye,” Rick said, “See you soon.” He put the gun from his nightstand into his pocket. He walked down the stairs, leaving the device at the foot of the whiteboard. He climbed into his car and drove away, pondering what would proceed. He parked just outside his gate. What was going to be just a couple of minutes wait for him, was going to be an eternity’s worth of punishment for Gerald. As the clock struck eleven past nine, on the second floor of the house which Rick had made their prison, Gerald awoke with a start...",1,1739377714.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

This close to buying a proper espresso machine..but i'm sure you've seen those that are like half the size but with the steam wand (like the SMEG half size: https://www.westelm.com/products/smeg-espresso-coffee-machine-d4677/?catalogId=71&sku=1322448&cm\_ven=PLA&cm\_cat=Google&cm\_pla=Kitchen%20%26%20Dining%20%3E%20Coffee%20%26%20Tea%20Accessories&cm\_ite=1322448\_14465514686\_pla-1412755935831&gad\_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAqrG9BhAVEiwAaPu5zlOwUehN\_N\_Zt3eCzEnl1H-BiW3Winv8jhJ0zO5EMAEq87TIdOMVeBoCMakQAvD\_BwE).

But then there's the full size like this: [https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/smeg-semi-automatic-espresso-machine/?catalogId=79&sku=8843088&cm\_ven=PLA&cm\_cat=Google&cm\_pla=Electrics%20%3E%20Espresso%20Machines&cm\_ite=8843088\_14571727833\_aud-1967894174593%3Apla-1830762825772&gad\_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAqrG9BhAVEiwAaPu5zvhq\_89vpcKkmsAkKjT228dKZwL2saWS9Y2NlPo-sJgz0SNT6oankhoCVGYQAvD\_BwE](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/smeg-semi-automatic-espresso-machine/?catalogId=79&sku=8843088&cm_ven=PLA&cm_cat=Google&cm_pla=Electrics%20%3E%20Espresso%20Machines&cm_ite=8843088_14571727833_aud-1967894174593%3Apla-1830762825772&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAqrG9BhAVEiwAaPu5zvhq_89vpcKkmsAkKjT228dKZwL2saWS9Y2NlPo-sJgz0SNT6oankhoCVGYQAvD_BwE)

I want to buy something that makes really good espresso for lattes so the steam wand is a must. So the first half size seems to fulfill that. Yet then there's the issue of grinding the coffee beans. Why have a separate grinder if it comes automatically with the espresso machine? Is there a reason to buy a separate grinder and get the half size one? Is the half size one not as good quality of espresso compared to the full size one?

Total noob and excuse my unprofessional language. I've tried for awhile now with the Aeropress to make lattes and while it's decent, it just isn't the same. I think I do need real espresso after all. Especially we decided to make homemade coffee now instead of buying an expensive latte daily like we used to. My husband drinks regular coffee with no milk or sugar so good grinding is a must as well.

However, these actions have displeased the noble merchants of La Serenissima, because they have without fail been the ones to open their coffees to bail out the state once the enemy, be they Austrian or French, march on the Terra Firma itself.

Therefore, following the rash foreign politics of Doge Leonardo Loredan, which put the Most Serene Republic of Venice at risk of territorial war yet again, the Minor Council has cooperated with the Senate to place the Doge under a regency of sorts. The Doge has been reduced to ceremonial duties, while the six Ductal Councillors have taken over the day-to-day executive decision-making.

Doge Leonardo Loredan has served the Republic with distinction, so removing him from office is out of the question. He has many supporters left. But the elites of the arcane and byzantine government of Venice have come to an agreement and that is to do without his brazen politics for the few years that remain in the old Doge's life. The regency and disenfranchisement of the Doge is to last no longer than Loredan's own lifespan, after all.

1inurlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1inurlf/supplement_tips_from_chatgpt_while_using/,Supplement Tips from ChatGPT while using Wellbutrin XL 150mg,"Thought I would share the results I got from ChatGPT when I asked about supplements while taking Wellbutrin XL 150mg, as I was finding a lot of mixed information online and on Reddit.  Three things to note:

1. I'm aware that ChatGPT just scours the internet for already published information.  I just like using it for a clean recap.
2. I've heard that ChatGPT is depleting our oceans, this makes me sad and I think there are bigger contributors to this who we should be focusing our wrath towards. But we can't fight the big fight without our mental health being strong, so this felt like a good use of the program.
3. I'm not a doctor, so take from this what you find interesting and please check with your doctor if you are not sure.

Ok, so first I had asked about probiotics and then continued from there.

Yes, you can take **Wellbutrin XL 150mg** with a probiotic. There are no known interactions between Wellbutrin (bupropion) and probiotics that would lessen the medication's efficacy.

However, if you experience any gastrointestinal side effects (which can be common with both Wellbutrin and probiotics), you might want to take them at different times of the day to see if that helps. Otherwise, they should be fine together.

Would you like any tips on timing for taking them?

# You said:

Yes please

# ChatGPT said:

For the best results, you can follow this timing:

* **Wellbutrin XL 150mg** – Take in the **morning** with or without food (as prescribed). Since Wellbutrin can be stimulating, taking it earlier in the day helps avoid sleep disturbances.
* **Probiotic** – Timing depends on the type:
   * **Lactobacillus & Bifidobacterium-based probiotics** (most common): Best taken **30 minutes before a meal** or with food.
   * **Saccharomyces boulardii** (yeast-based probiotic): Can be taken **with or without food** anytime.
   * **Spore-based probiotics** (Bacillus strains): Often best **with food** for better survival.

To avoid any potential stomach discomfort, you might try taking Wellbutrin with breakfast and your probiotic later with lunch or dinner. Let me know if you need more details! 😊

# You said:

Thank you. Are there any supplements that I should avoid while taking Wellbutrin XL 150mg?

# ChatGPT said:

You're very welcome! 😊 Yes, there are a few supplements to be cautious with while taking **Wellbutrin XL 150mg**, as they may increase the risk of side effects or interact with the medication. Here are the main ones to watch out for:

# Supplements to Avoid or Use with Caution

1. **St. John’s Wort** – Can lower Wellbutrin’s effectiveness and increase the risk of **serotonin syndrome** if you're taking other antidepressants.
2. **5-HTP & L-Tryptophan** – These boost serotonin levels and may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome when combined with Wellbutrin.
3. **SAM-e (S-Adenosylmethionine)** – May enhance antidepressant effects but also increase the risk of overstimulation or serotonin syndrome.
4. **High-Dose Caffeine** – Wellbutrin can already be stimulating, so too much caffeine (from coffee, pre-workout supplements, or energy drinks) can **increase anxiety, jitteriness, and insomnia**.
5. **Ginkgo Biloba & Ginseng** – These may lower the seizure threshold, which is already a risk with Wellbutrin.
6. **Kava & Valerian Root** – Can have sedative effects that might interact unpredictably with Wellbutrin’s stimulating properties.
7. **High-Dose Fish Oil & Vitamin E** – These have blood-thinning effects and might slightly increase the risk of bleeding, though it's a minor concern unless you're on other blood thinners.
8. **Alcohol** – Not a supplement, but important to note! Wellbutrin can increase the risk of **seizures** when combined with alcohol, so it's best to limit or avoid drinking.

# Supplements That Are Generally Safe & May Be Beneficial

✔️ **Magnesium & L-Theanine** – Can help with anxiety and sleep without interacting negatively with Wellbutrin.  
✔️ **Vitamin D & B Vitamins** – Support mood and energy, which align well with Wellbutrin’s effects.  
✔️ **Omega-3 (Moderate Dose)** – May support brain health and mood.  
✔️ **Probiotics & Adaptogens (like Ashwagandha, in moderation)** – Generally safe for gut health and stress management.

Would you like recommendations for supplements that might **enhance** Wellbutrin’s effects in a safe way? 😊

# You said:

Yes please

🕒 **Best Time to Take**: **Morning or midday** with food for better absorption.

As of writing this, I'm contemplating whether I should press the ""delete playlist"" button on my phone. You see, I'm haunted. Not by specters or ghouls, but by a playlist—and a guy I met on Reddit. It sounds ridiculous, I know. But sometimes, the most potent ghosts are born from fleeting digital connections and unshared playlists. Let me tell you the story that involves a guy and a whole lot of Laufey.

Ryan was eye candy—a cheerleader from the blue school in Katipunan. We connected in the dying days of the year, exchanging messages that felt surprisingly genuine. Okay, fine, crush ko siya a little bit.

We talked about the future, about post-grad plans. I was leaning towards UP Law. Then he casually suggested, ""Why not Ateneo? Corporate Law? We could be classmates."" Shocks, the possibility! Shared study sessions? Campus coffee dates? My brain short-circuited a little.

Then, there was the music. Turns out, he's a Laufey fanboy (a smooth, melodic contrast to my own boygenius obsession). Honestly, before him, she wasn't even on my radar. But he sent me his playlist, and I dove in. Suddenly, her music became the soundtrack to this unexpected little connection. It was like he gave me the cheat codes to feels.

Being the maarte, dramatic person that I am, I made him a playlist in return—a very special playlist, full of songs that made me think of him. It was my way of saying, ""Hey, I think you're pretty awesome,"" without actually saying it, duh. It was appropriately titled ""For Ryan"" (because, you know, subtlety).

Then… silence. He vanished. Ghosted. The modern-day equivalent of a Dear John letter, only delivered through the absence of messaging app notification.

Now, I know, it was just a few days—a short fling, ano ba. But sometimes, those little moments can feel… bigger. And I genuinely enjoyed our conversations. And I really wanted him to hear that playlist. I never bothered to text him because, honestly, we were both graduating. I figured he was just busy with school.

Ryan, if you ever happen to stumble across this, I hope you're doing well. I hope you're crushing it in cheerleading and life in general. And I really hope you're still listening to Laufey.

And maybe, just maybe, you'll get a chance to hear ""For Ryan"" someday.

No expectations, just… putting it out there.

What have you done to make this more enjoyable for yourself and your bridal party other than supply a medicinal amount of coffee and croissants? I’m so worried they’re gonna hate having to get dolled up at this ungodly hour - none of us are early birds. 

What is the status quo on alcohol before the wedding? Did you guys do this? I was thinking coffee, croissants, mimosas and getting them some presents etc but what if we all are wasted before the actual ceremony - how have you done this at your wedding? 

Factors worth pointing out- we don’t have a planner nor do we have budget left for one. we are staying at the hotel the night before and renting out some airbnbs next door which is where we’ll be getting ready in the morning due to its close proximity and reduced chance of anyone else in the wedding like the groom etc seeing us. This means we’re gonna miss the hotel breakfast which is served 8:30-9:30. Do you think if I asked the hotel nicely they’d do anything for us, considering some of us are gonna miss the £25 a head breakfast we’re paying for? Ugh. 

Also - I already asked the makeup artist if she’d bring another stylist to cut the time in half. She said no. The hairdresser answered all my other questions to this, bar this one. I’m loathed if I ask again, or if I change suppliers as I’ll lose my deposits and already spending close to £2k on hair and makeup.

1inummw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1inummw/shes_upset_i_went_no_contact_after_she_told_me/,She’s upset I went no contact after she told me she needed space?,"So, I  (27M) was in a situationship with this girl (22F) who works next door to me. Things were going amazing at first. I’d see her almost every day, and I even made it a habit to go into her workplace daily to grab coffee, mostly just as an excuse to see her. But we'd talk there all the time and she reiterated that she loved me stopping by. 

Then, out of nowhere, she basically ghosted me an entire weekend and called me that Monday to break things off and gave a million different reasons. 

She’s been hurt in the past and has trust issues. Her mom’s immigration status is being held up, which is stressing her out. Her dad is strict, and she's worried about having me around him. She doesn’t want to lose her independence.

I didn’t argue but I gave my perspective and told her how I felt and when she tried to friendzone me I immediately shut it down and said that I wouldn't accept that. I told her I had feelings for her and that remaining friends wouldn't be fair to either one of us. 

The final thing she said was ""I need space.""

I said okay and wished her well and got off the phone. Since then I respected her decision and gave her the space SHE asked for. I stopped going in for coffee everyday and I haven't called or texted her at all. Essentially I've gone no contact. 

Now this was not out of pettiness or spite. Of course I was hurt and going through a bunch of different thoughts and feelings. But my core thought process the entire time was if she truly wants to be with me and enough time goes by, she'll reach out and try to fix things. If not, then I'll move on and find someone who does want to be with me. After all she's the one who said she needed space and started this whole thing. 

Now, for some extra context: I’m a huge fan of Berserk and own all the deluxe volumes. She was interested in getting into it, so I let her borrow two of my books while we were still together.

During her call she told me she wanted to give the books back to me personally and that she wouldn't feel comfortable just dropping them off at my job. Now she was very emotional and crying during this call and I told her to just hang on them and we'll figure out down the road what to do about them. 

Fast forward three weeks from the call: I was craving my usual coffee order, so I sent one of my employees in to pick it up for me. Now she doesn't always work the coffee stand there and I knew that she wouldn't be there but I guess she still noticed my guy in there getting my order. 

An hour later I get a text from her:

""If you are working tomorrow or Thursday, would you mind sending one of your coworkers to Starbucks to pick up your Berserk books since you are completely avoiding me? I would highly appreciate it :)""

So I responded:

""I’m not avoiding you. You told me you needed space last time we spoke, so I was respecting that and waiting to hear from you when you were ready. But that’s fine, my apologies. I’ll send someone over Thursday.""

Then about an hour later she says:

""Don’t worry, I’ll drop it off later.""

This was on IMessage so I just liked her message and left it at that. Then later that day from her:

""I’ll drop them off tomorrow. I am not gonna have time today.""

I respond:

""Okay, I’ll let my manager tomorrow know""

Then, as soon as she realizes I won’t be there tomorrow, she immediately changes the plan again:

""Well, let’s leave it for Thursday. It’s fine"" 

For reference, tomorrow is the one day she knows I’ll be at work. I didn't answer and I just left it at that. 

So now I’m wondering what in the hell is she doing?

At first she asked me to send someone else. But when she realized I wouldn’t be there, she kept shifting the plan until it lined up with my schedule.

It feels like she’s going out of her way to manufacture an in person meet up after telling me she was unsure and needed space. If she really just wanted to return the books, why wouldn’t she just drop them off when she first said she would? Why keep changing the day until it lines up with when she knows I’ll be there?

Tbh I like the coffee and everything but the main reason I went in there everyday was to see her. So naturally when that reason disappeared I stopped going in. 

The most frustrating part? She hasn’t even considered that I might have needed space too. What if I was actually hurt by her pulling away? What if I wasn’t ready to see her yet? Instead she’s framing this as me avoiding her as if I was supposed to just act like nothing happened and keep showing up like before.

What should I do? How should I handle tomorrow? Was it wrong for me to go completely no contact?",2,1739377040.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

She agreed and as she was already in the mall she said she will wait for 40-50 mins as I lived 14kms away. 

I booked rapido immediately and all the way I was thinking ""bhai yaar kat na jaye"" and also convinced myself ki kat gaya toh I'll share experience on reddit. 

She said she will be waiting in Starbucks, I was very tight on budget and I have never been to Starbucks. I googled what to order and how to pronounce the name. She loves Kinder Joy so bought it from the same mall tried searching for flowers but couldn't find them. 

I met her and she was a bit extrovert so made my job easy. Now it was time to order something I searched for the cheapest on the list went with Caffee-Latte (Picco) and she ordered Vanilla whipped Coffee ( TALL). 

I was like yeh pakka kat degi. I still went ahead and I paid. She tried to remove the phone but I said we will split (I was like itnah jaldi nahi bolna tha). We talked for an hour and she mentioned she met another guy today in mall who matched on bumble and also it her friends birthday today (as she said) so she was in mall. 

I asked her how's her dating life been she said she never dated. And added she doesn't go on date but it's like a meet up for her. 

It was time to leave, She side hugged and later while crossing the road I held her hand and helped her crossed the road. Waited till she sat in bus and then I left.

She texted it was really fun talking to me and later asked if I would be willing to join next time when she goes to ISCKON temple, I agreed. Later in evening we talked, she video called and the talking stage continued the next day too. 

But third day I wasn't feeling the vibe and I realized it was kinda same from her. The text seemed dry and the instant replies got delayed. I thought ki it's done. So I confessed her ki that talking has changed. All a sudden she apologized and said she got committed. 

I said good for you and then I texted her.

1) First order was stacked and IMMEDIATELY after accepting, the customer started blowing my phone up. For safety reasons, I don't answer calls or message while driving. When I got to the store (Starbucks), I saw that the customer wanted me to order coffee for them - the only thing on their order was a Danish and they sent me a screenshot of their coffee order. I promptly unassigned (though I would like tips for avoiding a completion hit on something like that in the future) 

2) Made direct eye contact with someone, waved at them, and flashed my high beams 3 times to let them get over in front of me. They continued sitting completely still in the middle of the highway, looking over their left shoulder with their left blinker on. I still don't know if they ever moved over. 

3) Had a semi cut me off getting from the right lane into my lane, only to get back into the right lane less than 100 feet later to turn onto the interstate (and no, they didn't pass anyone) 

4) Had someone ELSE ride at least 10 under with their left blinker on and kept flashing at them to get over - they never did. Literally they were within my line of sight for miles with their blinker on, but they never moved over. 

5) Last customer didn't leave a gate code and wouldn't answer their phone (shoutout to the dude who got out in the pouring rain to punch his in for me). It was a ""hand it to me"", too, and  I rang a loud-ass doorbell and stood within sight of the peephole and window with the food in view. They didn't answer until I had TEN. SECONDS. LEFT. on the clock and they looked annoyed and confused. Like YOU'RE THE ONE WHO ORDERED AND WANTED IT HANDED TO YOUUU (I would've just left it tbh but I'm on EBT so a few extra minutes doesn't matter to me) 

Tho I did have a delivery to what I think was a vet's office and I got to see a lil weenie dog and got a $5 cash tip (on top of I think $2.50 in the app? And it was like 2 miles one way) - oddly enough tho, the customer was eating something when I got there. No judgement tho",3,1739376969.0,doordash_drivers,2,0.67,False
1inulgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1inulgp/best_portable_espresso_maker_with_heating_200/,Best Portable Espresso Maker with Heating? [€200],"Hi everyone, I'm looking for a portable espresso maker for travel, camping, and hiking. I won’t use it daily, but when I do, I might need 2-3+ cups in a session. My top priorities are:



\-Heats water (so I don’t need to preheat separately)

\-Uses ground coffee (not just pods)

\-Easy to clean

\-Low noise

\-Fast charging

I’ve narrowed it down to these models, but I’d love advice or other recommendations:



CONQUECO

CERA+

Handpresso E-Presso 21700

Outin Nano



A few key questions I have:

\-How long do they take to fully recharge?

\-Can they keep hot water inside like a thermos, or do they only heat on demand?

\-Which one would be best for making multiple cups in a row while outdoors?

I’m based between Italy and France and typically drink a good cup of double espresso from Lelit coffee machine!

If anyone has experience with these models (or better options), I’d love your input! Also, let me know if I missed any important details.

When I was leaving I said goodbye and thanks and she gave me a little more than a nod. The other students had similar experiences with their nurses, and the other clinical groups in our cohort had the same stories as well even thought they’re all different hospitals. I’m just trying to wrap my head around how someone who’s essentially a community advocate and teacher displayed such horrible behavior and manners. 

Also I’d like to note that I completely understand nursing is a fast-paced job and her job doesn’t encompass holding my hand thru the process but she had enough time to take a lengthy coffee break 20 min into her shift.
