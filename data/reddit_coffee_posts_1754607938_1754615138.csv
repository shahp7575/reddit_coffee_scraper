1mkhm44,https://i.redd.it/g7x0vplo1phf1.png,Small kitchen sink/hob placement dilemma,"I am currently looking to install a new kitchen and I am stuck in two minds around the placement of various parts of it. The space is rather small and also needs to include the dining table so I am limited in options for the layout of the kitchen.

I planned initially for a U shaped layout with the standard sink/hob/fridge triangle but the placement of the sink is really bugging me as it is placed alongside the bar top area, I am worried it will look cluttered with plates/clean-up and also have issues with splashing water. What are people's thoughts on the placement of the sink and the hob? The fridge is hard to place anywhere else, it is a large double door fridge but I do find the space inside useful so I would prefer to keep it. I was thinking that the sink could maybe go alongside the bottom wall where the pantry area is but the depth is not enough unfortunately.

Another option I was thinking of was to have a raised countertop behind the area where the sink currently is on the plans and have high stools behind that. I am looking at it again though and I don't think I have enough depth to make the raised portion useful.

I am open to ideas on both the layout and placement of appliances/sink.",1,1754615053.0,kitchenremodel,0,1.0,False

Beginner Creators, This Growth Guide Actually Makes $ 💰 (Before It's Saturated!)","**Stop Throwing Darts! Beginner Creators, This Growth Guide Actually Makes $ 💰 (Before It's Saturated!)**

Hey, fellow creators! 🎨

So, let’s get real for a second—ever feel like you’re just throwing darts in the dark, hoping something sticks? Like, *why* is it so hard to figure out how to make this content creation thing actually pay off? You’re not alone! 😩

I remember when I first started out. I was posting random stuff, trying every trend I could find, and literally praying to the algorithm gods. Spoiler alert: it didn’t work out well. 🙈 But then something clicked… and I want to share that epiphany with you!

Here are a few things I learned on my journey—simple shifts that made a world of difference. 

### 1. **Know Your Audience (Like, Really Know Them)**
   - Don’t just guess what they want. Do some digging! 
   - Look at comments, surveys, and even *read* their social media posts.
   - What are they struggling with? What do they love? 

### 2. **Focus on Pain Points, Not Just Perfection**
   - It’s tempting to make everything look spotless. But seriously, who can relate to perfect? 
   - Instead, be that creator who offers real solutions. 
   - Example: A friend of mine posts tutorials about fixing common tech issues. Guess what? People LOVE the imperfections and realness!

### 3. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - Yes, consistent posting is essential, but don't sacrifice quality for the sake of a schedule!
   - Spend time creating content that you’re proud of. It shows!
   - Don’t be that one person flooding feeds with bland nonsense (you know who you are!). 

### 4. **Dive into Niches (Before They Get Crowded)**
   - Ever heard of the “saturation” myth? 🤔 It’s not always true.
   - Focus on what *you* love and know. 
   - Like knitting for cats? 🎉 You'd be surprised how many people would resonate with that!

### 5. **Engage, Don’t Just Broadcast**
   - Talk to your followers! Seriously, it’s like having a chit-chat with friends over coffee. 
   - Ask questions, share stories, and don’t be afraid to be vulnerable.
   - People connect with people, not brands.

### 6. **Embrace the Journey**
   - Growth doesn’t happen overnight. Celebrate those little victories! 
   - Did you finally get a comment from someone? Yay! High five! 🤚
   - Remember: it’s a marathon, not a sprint.

So, there you have it! Throwing darts in the dark won’t get you far, but if you combine a little bit of strategy with your passion, you’re setting yourself up for some serious success. 🌟

He’s exactly my type physically, but never chatted too much so didn’t know his personality well. At the time he would always kind of look at me a longer but nothing was done (and I prefer men make first move, so I didn’t do anything lol)

I had a hinge account at the time and I reckon he found me on there. Followed my instagram and we got to chatting a bit, he would say “my favourite little barista” etc but no flirting or ANYTHING in person. 

One night we were going to hangout, and he said I could come over at 9pm (1. No. 2. I run a cafe sir, I need to be up at 5am)

He then proceeded to tell me he didn’t want anything serious, just casual. I took it as just a hookup. I was in the process of moving on from an ex situation, so I wasn’t sure what I was wanting and was honest and said I didn’t want a relationship but definitely wasn’t keen on casual. 

He said he hopes I change my mind, and we left it. Before he left to go back to uni, i messaged and said “is it too late to change my mind…” turns out he was leaving like next day. He still came into cafe everyday previous to this and we both acted like nothing was going on.

He had left, hadn’t seen him for months, thought that was the end, forgot abt him lol.

This morning, this Mf shows up 10 minutes before we open. I was caught off guard and was nervous, turns out he’s back in town until the end of the year. Perfect shot for me, had a bit of small talk but he wasn’t really talkative (tbf he never really was).

Now what are some options for me to go from here. I hate making the first move, what I’ve found is guys my age or ones I make the first move with get cocky or act uninterested and drag it on, I hate that. Either say yes let’s get to know each other or no not keen. We had a weird follow unfollow thing go on for awhile, and at this point it’s just embarassing if I follow him. 

Should I just leave it and see what happens? I know nothing will happen in person cause I reckon we are both not the confrontational people but idk. I’m just excited he’s back 😂",1,1754614885.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I went after the circle I’d failed to wipe away, but only the ring remained on the desk.
A small click from the glasses starts the morning. Only the shallow sound of morning stays.
The detergent’s smell, still lukewarm, moved onto my fingers and lingered as if tracing a seam in cloth.
My sight stays abandoned there. The glass bottom taps lightly; only a fine crack marks the day.
I pretended to start the day, and didn’t.

At the banquet, reheated glory mixed well, and the laughter stretched long.
The applause is long; the responsibility short. In the fogged mirror, only the face that suits me.
The torn memo’s corner grazes a finger; blood beads before words do.

The scan is a breath late. Step, stop, scuff. The pace won’t match.
A voice calling my name cuts off beyond a thin wall, only its edge trailing.
After speaking ill of a friend, my chest grows heavy; by dawn I wake in the same scene.

I opened the notification. Closed it without replying—intending to put it off.
Knowing it was deliberate. The reason still won’t surface.
The numbers line up; only the heart lags.
The envelope’s corner hits the same finger again; the paper makes a faint sound.

The needle at three a.m. jumps in my chest; the sensation won’t leave even by noon.
A round shadow on the water goes slack; the cupboard’s closing shakes things inside.
The gently-looking jacket’s seams keep tracing an old line; the feel quietly worsens.

Morning comes. The wiped circle has turned into a coffee ring and dries in a different place from last night.
A single red dot inside. The same smell lingers, thin; the mirror stays clouded.
Maybe only the appearance changed to fit what I wanted to see.
My fingertips stay cold; only the smell remains.

I’ve gotten better at acting saved. At acting savior, just as much.
No one says a thing. We keep moving late. Only the ring remains, slightly out of place.

Commentary Poem | Transparent Shoal

The ring isn’t dirt. It’s the outline of the fact you wiped.
Not a wish to erase, but a trace of choosing not to look.
The desk grain stays calm; only there time sinks in a circle.

The envelope’s corner chooses the same finger every time—
not chance but the precision of habit.
Small pain needs no reason. The red dot becomes a mark,
a simple cue to your later self.

Scent changes meaning with temperature.
Lukewarm detergent resembles forgiveness; when it cools it’s closer to testimony.
It stays on the fingers and slips into other tasks, not a memory but a traveling substance.

The scan lags a breath. Step, stop, scuff.
The stream of bodies moves on; only the line of the heart is slow.
Delay isn’t laziness. It’s a choice, a thin wall set between.

At the table, reheated glory is sweet on the tongue.
Applause is long; responsibility short.
Laughter spreads like oil and lets excuses slide.
The pose of being saved spreads easily; so does the pose of saving.
Both are techniques for brightening silence.

The notification was opened; the reply was shut.
You did it to put it off. You know the intent and still can’t find the reason.
This kind of choice never becomes a voice, yet it feels surer than any record.

The three a.m. needle points inside the body.
A faint ache that won’t leave by noon makes you trace the same line again and again.
The jacket’s gentle seams walk an old path, feigning progress while staying faithful to the map of the past.

The mirror isn’t fair. Fog does the sorting.
What appears is the face that’s convenient; what doesn’t is the inconvenient hand.
Appearance isn’t fact, but it decides action faster than fact.

The transparent shoal isn’t fish. It’s a shoal of ways of seeing.
The ring, the corner, the scent, the delay, the unsent reply—each is small,
yet each fixes today’s position. The ring holds today’s place and forecasts tomorrow’s.
Even if you wipe, as long as you keep choosing, it stays a little askew.

1mkhdrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1mkhdrk/i_dont_know_what_to_think_lol/,I don’t know what to think lol,"I’ve been a barista for nearly three years, spending all but a month and a half at my first coffee shop. We did high volume and I handled drink creation and prep, but I never learned much about dialing in espresso, pour overs, or coffee profiles. The owners weren’t focused on third wave coffee or building a coffee community, so there wasn’t much emphasis on skill development.

I started at 17 while still in high school, and my managers weren’t especially knowledgeable about coffee. It was more about keeping the shop running than creating constant “learning moments.” Then college and a mental health crisis limited my growth even more. The most I learned about was machines and grinders, and that was in my own time.

Now I’m at a new shop with higher standards, starting alongside someone with only a year of experience who’s already stronger in some areas. My latte art is inconsistent—stacked tulips are my best—and smaller drinks are worse. I even feel like I forgot how to steam milk after a month-long break between jobs. I’m learning pour overs, but I’m struggling to meet the standard I feel I should already be at.

It’s frustrating because this shop is small and its baristas are well known. I want to match their quality so customers don’t prefer others over me, but right now I just feel like I’m falling short. 

Has anyone else been in a similar boat? Sometimes I wonder if I’m just a slow learner or something.

It is pretty accurate! :),"Cisco - You're the corporate overlord of your homelab, commanding your network with the iron fist of enterprise-grade precision. You probably have a CCNA certificate framed on your wall and whisper ""IOS commands"" in your sleep. Your homelab is so over-engineered, it could run a small country's internet. You've got a closet full of Catalyst switches and a secret handshake with the IT guy at work for spare SFPs. Personality trait: You say ""uptime"" like it's a sacred vow.

Ubiquiti - You're the hipster of homelabs, sipping craft coffee while admiring your sleek UniFi setup through a minimalist lens. Your network is so user-friendly, even your grandma could manage it via the UniFi app. You've got a Dream Machine Pro mounted like modern art, and you've definitely bragged about your VLANs on a Reddit thread. Personality trait: You own at least one pair of skinny jeans and call your homelab ""bespoke.""

HPE - You're the practical, no-nonsense type who bought a used HPE server off eBay because ""it was a steal."" Your homelab sounds like a jet engine and consumes enough power to dim the neighborhood. You've got a spreadsheet tracking every component's serial number and a backup plan for your backup plan. Personality trait: You mutter ""redundancy is life"" while triple-checking your RAID array.

Juniper - You're the contrarian tech wizard, shunning mainstream brands for the Juniper life. Your homelab runs JunOS like a finely tuned orchestra, and you've got strong opinions about BGP routing that you'll share at any networking meetup. You probably own a t-shirt that says ""MPLS or Bust."" Personality trait: You're the person who argues about open standards while everyone else just nods.

Netgear - You're the budget-conscious tinkerer, proudly rocking a Netgear switch you snagged from a garage sale. Your homelab is a glorious mishmash of consumer-grade gear held together by zip ties and hope. You've got a 10/100 switch still chugging along because ""it just works.""

Seems really working. Ask me in another month if want. But for last 5 weeks been great! **I only do Addy every other day, AM dose only. Bupropion daily, slightly lower dose. Must use (superior) IR version b/c dose & timing is critical if combining these.

Overall, if anyone ever gives up trying to find real Addy. Consider it's cousin Bupropion IR, it's a 'stimulating antidepressant' - helps me a lot anyway. Or try plan above, it's the bee's knee, at least for me.

Overall the TAM-2A1 is a nice addition to the R.R.U roster it is light enough to be transported by most of the R.R.U transport while also still being a pretty capable and comfortable machine to operate in, more or less the crews love it for it comfort and deadly firepower especially for the Argentinian of the Committee.",3,1754613169.0,OriginalCharacter,2,1.0,False

- Vitola: Cosacos, 5 3/8 x 42
- Wrapper: Shade Grown Nicaraguan Corojo 99 Rosado
- Undisclosed Nicaraguan binder and filler
- 14 wks rest at 66% RH

Takes a delicate touch to get some of the packaging off but it is a beautiful presentation. Firm and evenly-filled with a smooth wrapper and slight sheen. This cigar comes in a wide array of vitolas and this one is right up my alley.

The draw offers a fair amount of resistance, just shy of being too much. Flavors present immediately - graham, lots of black pepper and honey. As the first third carries on, caramel and a touch of cream enter the mix. Body and strength are solidly medium.

Creaminess and malts lead the way into the second third. The typical Garcia black pepper sticks around but settles a bit. Toasted caramel and sweet cream linger in the back of the throat on the finish. Really nice blend so far, it’s a departure from the usual MF profile but in a good way.

Notes of light coffee and milk chocolate come into the fold in the last third. Sweet graham cracker makes a big return with aged tobacco goodness. Creaminess is plentiful and a wide array of lightly sweetened flavor notes come and go.

The burn line has been impeccable the whole way with zero touch-ups needed. Fantastic construction throughout the entire 90-minute smoke time. This is an excellent blend.

Hey! I’m looking for some folks to game with who are open to trying Baldur’s Gate 3 with me or maybe replaying it alongside a newer player. I’ve played a bit before, but only made it as far as the Underdark in Act 1, so there’s still a lot I haven’t experienced yet.

For BG3, I’d love an intro first to make sure we vibe before committing to a long playthrough — nothing worse than getting halfway through and realizing our styles don’t match. For what it’s worth, I’ll probably be romancing Astarion or Halsin.

I’m also down to make friends for Marvel Rivals! I usually play ranked, so I’d prefer console friends (PS5 here), but I’m happy to team up casually too.  I'm currently in gold.

Outside of gaming, I have a variety of hobbies and interests, and I’m hoping to find people to not just game with, but maybe hang out on Discord and chat with if we click. I enjoy hiking, foraging, reading fantasy & sci-fi novels, cooking, Magic: The Gathering, and coffee. My favorite band is Sleep Token.

If you’re chill, enjoy gaming and conversation, and maybe want a regular buddy for both, send me a message

*“You’re telling me they didn’t steal…anything? Nothing at all?”*

The man’s bloodshot eyes had begun to glaze over. Flashing red and blue lights illuminated his face, cleaving through the thick darkness of my secluded front lawn.

Maybe I should have lied.

*“Well…no. I mean, I haven’t exactly taken a full inventory of my stuff yet, but it doesn’t seem like anything is missing…”*

The cop cleared his throat, cutting me off. A loud, phlegm-steeped crackle emanated from the depths of his tree trunk sized throat. Without taking a breath, he smoothly transitioned the sputtering noise into a series of followup questions.

*“Let me make sure I’m getting this right, buddy: you woke to the sound of burglars just…moving your furniture around? That’s it? I’m supposed to believe that a roving band of renegade interior decorators broke in to, what…open up the space a bit? Adjust the Feng Shui?*

He looked over his shoulder and gave his partner an impish grin. The other officer, an older man with rows of cigarette-stained teeth, responded to his impromptu standup routine with a raspy croak, which was either a chuckle or a wheeze. I assumed chuckle, but he wasn’t smiling, so it was hard to say for certain.

My chest began to fill with all-too familiar heat. I forced a smile, fists clenched tightly at my sides.

*Let’s try this one more time,* I thought.

*“I can’t speak to their intent, sir. And that’s not what I said. I didn't hear them move the furniture. I woke up to the sound of music playing downstairs. As I snuck over to the landing, I saw a flash, followed by a whirring noise. It startled me, so I stepped back, and the floorboards creaked.”*

The cop-turned-comic appeared to drop the act. His smile fell away, and he started to jot something down on his notepad as I recounted the experience. I was relieved to be taken seriously. The rising inferno in my chest cooled, but didn’t completely abate: it went from Mount Vesuvius moments before volcanic eruption to an overcooked microwave dinner, molten contents bubbling up against the plastic packaging.

*“I guess they heard the creak, because the music abruptly stopped. Then multiple sets of feet shuffled through the living room. By the time I got to the bannister and looked over, though, they had vanished. That’s when I noticed all the furniture had been rearranged. I think they left through the back door, because I found it unlocked. Must have forgotten to secure the damn thing.”*

*“Hmm…”* he said, staring at the notepad, scratching his chin and mulling it over. After a few seconds, he lifted the notepad up to his partner, who responded with an affirmative nod.

*“What do you think? Has this happened to anyone else closer to town?”* I asked, impatient to learn what he’d written.

*“Oh, uh…no, probably not.”* He snorted. *“I have an important question, though.”*

His impish grin returned. Even the older cop’s previously stoic lips couldn’t help but twist into a tiny smirk.

*“What song was it?”*

Seething anger clawed at the back of my eyeballs.

*“My Dark Star by The London Suede,”* I replied automatically.

*“Huh, I don’t know that one,”* said the younger cop, clearly holding back a bout of uproarious laughter.

In that moment, the worst part wasn’t actually the utter disinterest and dismissal. It was that, like the cop, I’d never listened to that song before last night. Didn’t know any other tracks by *The London Suede*, either. So, for the life of me, I couldn’t understand how those words spilled from my lips.

I’d google the track once they left. It *was* what I heard.

Anyway, the cop then presented his notepad, tapping his pen against the paper.

*“These were my guesses.”*

In scribbled ink, it read *“Bad Romance? The Macarena?”*

It took restraint not to slap the notepad out of his hand.

God, I wanted to, but it would have been counterproductive to add *assaulting a lawman* to my already long list of pending felonies. Criminality was how I landed myself out here in Podunk corn-country to begin with, nearly divorced and with a savings account emptier than church pews on December 26th.

So, I settled for screaming a few questions of my own at the younger of the two men.

For example: I inquired about the safety of this backcountry town’s tap water, speculating that high mercury levels must have irreparably damaged his brain as a child. Then, I asked if his wife had suffered a similar fate. I figured there were good odds that she also drank from the tap, given that she was likely his sister.

Those weren’t the *exact* words I yelled as those neanderthals trudged back to their cruiser.

But you get the idea.

\- - - - -

No matter how much bottom-shelf whiskey I drank, sleep would not come.

Once dawn broke, I gave up, rolled out of bed, and drunkly stumbled downstairs to heave my furniture to its previous location. I didn’t necessarily *need* to move it all: my plan was to only be in that two-story fixer-upper long enough to perform some renovations and make it marketable. In the meantime, I wasn’t expecting company, and it wasn’t like the intruders left my furnishings in an awkward pile at the center of the room. They shifted everything around, but it all remained usable.

I couldn’t stand the sight of it, though. It was a reminder that I plain didn’t understand *why* anyone would break in to play music and move some furniture around.

So, with some proverbial gas in the tank (two stale bagels, a cup of black coffee, additional whiskey), I got back to work. The quicker I returned to renovating, the quicker I could sell this godforsaken property. I purchased it *way* below market-value, so I was poised to make a pretty penny off of it.

Blair would eat her words. She’d see that I could maintain our “standard of living”, even without my lucrative corporate position and the even more lucrative insider trading. It wouldn’t be the same, but Thomas and her would be comfortable.

After all, I was a man. I *am* a man. I deserved a family.

More than that, I couldn’t endure the thought of being even more alone.

If that was even possible.

\- - - -

*How did they do all this without waking me up?* I contemplated, struggling to haul my cheap leather sofa across the room, its legs audibly digging into walnut-hardwood flooring.

I dropped the sectional with a gasp as a sharp pain detonated in my low back. The sofa slammed against the floor, and the sound of that collision reverberated through the relatively empty house.

Silence dripped back incrementally, although the barbershop quartet of herniated vertebral discs stacked together in my lumbar spine continued to sing and howl.

*“Close enough.”* I said out loud, panting between the words. My heart pounded and my head throbbed. Sobriety was tightening its skeletal hand around my neck: I was overdue for a dose of spirits to ward off that looming specter.

I left the couch in the center of the cavernous room, positioned diagonally with its seats towards a massive gallery of windows present on the front of the house, rather than facing the TV. A coffee table and a loveseat ended up sequestered tightly into the corner opposite the stairs, next to the hallway that led to the back door. Honestly, the arrangement looked much more insane after I tried to fix it, because I stopped halfway through.

I figured I could make another attempt after a drink.

So, the sweet lure of ethanol drew my feet forward, and that’s when I noticed it. A small, unassuming square of plastic, peeking out from under the couch. I don’t know exactly where it came from; perhaps it was hidden under something initially, or maybe I dislodged it from a sofa crease as I moved it.

Honestly, I tried to walk past it with looking. But the combination of dread and curiosity is a potent mixture, powerful enough to even quiet my simmering alcohol withdrawal.

With one hand bracing the small of my aching back, the other picked it up and flipped it over.

It was a polaroid.

The sofa was centered in the frame, and it was the dead of night.

When I arrived two weeks ago, I had the movers place the sofa against the wall. That wasn’t where it was in the picture. I could tell because the moon was visible through the massive windows above the group of people sitting on it.

At least, I think it was a group of people. I mean, the silhouettes were undoubtedly people-shaped.

But I couldn’t see any of their details.

The picture wasn’t poorly taken or blurry. It was well lit, too: I could appreciate the subtle ridges in the furniture's wooden armrests, as well as a splotchy wine stain present on the upholstery.

The flash perfectly illuminated everything, except for them.

Their frames were just…dark and jagged, like they had been scratched out with a pencil from *within* the picture. It was hard to tell where one form ended and another began. They overlapped, their torsos and arms congealing with each other. Taken together, they looked like an oversized accordion compromised of many segmented, human-looking shadows.

Not only that, but there was something intensely unnerving about the proportions of the picture. The sofa appeared significantly larger. I counted the heads. I recounted them, because I didn’t believe the number I came up with.

*Thirty-four*.

My hands trembled. A bout of nausea growled in my stomach.

Then, out of nowhere, a violent, searing pain exploded over the tips of my fingers where they were making contact with the polaroid. It felt similar to a burn, but that wasn’t exactly it. More like the stinging sensation of putting an ungloved hand into a mound of snow.

The polaroid fell out of my grasp. As it drifted towards the floor, I heard something coming from the hallway that led to the house’s back door. A distant melody that I had only heard once before last night, and yet I knew it by heart.

*“But she will come from India with a love in her eyes*  
*That say, ‘Oh, how my dark star will rise,’*  
*Oh, how my dark star, oh, how my dark star*  
*Oh, how my dark star will rise.”*

Terror left me frozen. I listened without moving an inch. By the time it ended, I was drenched with sweat, my skin coated in a layer of icy brine.

After a brief pause, the song just started over again.

My head became filled with visions. A group of teenagers right outside the backdoor, maybe the same ones who had broken in last night, playing the song and laughing under their breaths. Maybe the cop was there too, having been in on the entire scheme. Perhaps Blair hired them to harass me. The custody hearing was only weeks away. The more unstable I was, the more likely she’d get full custody of Thomas.

They were all out to prove I was a pathetic, wasted mess.

Of course, that was all paranoid nonsense, and none of that accounted for the polaroid.

I stomped around the couch, past the other furniture, down the narrow hallway, and wildly swung the door open.

\*“\****Who, THE FUCK, are…”***

My scream quickly collapsed. I stood on the edge of the first of three rickety steps that led into the backyard, scanning for the source of the song.

A few birds cawed and rustled in the pine trees that circled the house’s perimeter, no doubt startled by my tantrum. Otherwise, nature was still, and no one was there.

My fury dissipated. Logic found its way back to me.

Why was I expecting anyone to be there? The nearest house was a half-mile away. Blair wouldn’t hire anyone to torment me in such an astoundingly peculiar way, either. One, she wasn’t creative enough, and two, she wasn’t truly malicious. My former affluence was the foundation of our marriage. I knew that ahead of time. Once it was gone, of course she wanted out.

Before I could spiral into the black pits of self-loathing, a familiar hideaway, my ears perked.

The song was still playing. It sounded closer now.

But it wasn’t coming from outside the house like I’d thought.

\- - - - -

*Laundry room, bathroom, guest room. Laundry room, bathroom, guest room…*

No matter how much I racked my brain, nothing was coming to mind.

You see, there were three rooms that split off from the hallway that led to the backyard. From the perspective of the backdoor, the laundry room and the bathroom were on the left, and the guest room was on the right, directly across the laundry room.

*Maybe I’m just forgetting the layout. I haven’t been here that long, after all.*

I remembered there being three rooms, but I was looking at four doors, and the muffled sounds of *”My Dark Star”* were coming from the room I couldn’t remember.

My palm lingered on the doorknob. Despite multiple commands, my hand wouldn’t obey. I couldn’t overcome my fear. Eventually, though, I found a mantra that did the trick. Three little words that have bedeviled humanity since its inception: a universal fuel, having ignited the smallest of brutalities to the most pervasive, wide-reaching atrocities over our shared history.

*Be a man.*

*Be a man.*

***Be a man.***

My hand twisted, and I pushed the door open.

The room was tiny, no more than two hundred square feet by my estimation. Barren, too. There was nothing inside except flaking yellow wallpaper and the unmistakable odor of mold, damp and earthy.

But I could still hear *My Dark Star*, clearer than ever before. The sound was rough and crackling, like it was being played from vinyl that was littered with innumerable scratches.

I tiptoed inside.

It was difficult to pinpoint *precisely* where the song was coming from. So, I put an ear to each wall and listened.

When I placed my head on the wall farthest from the door, I knew I was getting close. The tone was sharper. The lyrics were crisp and punctuated. I could practically feel the plaster vibrate along with the bass.

I stepped back to fully examine the wall, trying to and failing to comprehend the phenomena. There was barely any hollow space behind it. Not enough to fit a sound system or a record player, that's for certain. If I took a sledgehammer to the plaster, I would just create a hole looking out into the backyard.

I stared at the decaying wallpaper, dumbfounded. I dragged my eyes over the crumbling surface, again and again, but no epiphany came. All the while, the song kept looping.

On what must have been the twentieth re-examination, my gaze finally hooked into something new. There was a faint sliver of darkness that ran the length of the wall, from ceiling to floor, next to the corner of the room.

A crack of sorts.

I cautiously walked towards it. Every step closer seemed to make the crack expand. Once my eyes were nearly touching it, the crevice had stretched from the width of a sheet of paper to that of a shot glass.

Somehow, I wasn’t fearful. My time in that false room had a dream-like quality to it. Surreal to the point where it disarmed me. Like it all wasn’t real, so I could wake up at any moment, safe and sound.

The edges of the fissure rippled, vibrating like a plucked guitar string. Soon after, I felt light tapping on the top of my boots. I tilted my head down.

Essentially, the wall coughed up a dozen more polaroids. They settled harmlessly at my feet.

The ones that landed picture-up were nearly identical to one I discovered in the living room, with small exceptions. Less scratched-out people, a different couch, more stars visible through the windows in the background, to name a few examples. The overturned polaroids had dates written on them in red sharpie, the earliest of which being September of 1996.

When I shifted my head back to the crevice, it found it had expanded further. I stared into the black maw as *My Dark Star* faded out once again, and I could see something.

There were hundreds of polaroids wedged deeper within the wall, and the gap had grown nearly big enough for me to fit my head through.

Long-belated panic stampeded over my skin, each nerve buzzing with savage thunder.

I turned and bolted, flinging the door shut behind me.

Racing through the narrow hallway, I peered over my shoulder, concerned that I was being chased.

Nothing was in pursuit, but there had been a change.

Now, there were only three total doors:

Laundry room, bathroom, guest room.

\- - - - -

I have a hard time recalling the following handful of hours. It’s all a haze. I know I considered leaving. I remember sobbing. I very much remember drinking. I tried to call Blair, but when I heard Thomas’s voice pick up the line, I immediately hung up, mind-shatteringly embarrassed. I didn’t call the police, for obvious reasons.

The order in which that all happened remains a bit of a mystery to me, but, in the end, I suppose it doesn’t really matter.

Here’s the bottom line:

I drank enough to pass out.

When the stupor abated and my eyes lurched open, I found myself on a sofa, propped upright.

Not angled in the middle of the room where I had left mine, either.

This one had its back to the windows.

\- - - - -

The scene I awoke to was more perplexing than it was hellish.

The living room was absolutely saturated with objects I didn’t recognize - knickknacks, framed photos, watercolor paintings, ornamented mirrors. A citrusy aroma wafted through the air, floral but acidic. There were the sounds of lively chatter around me, but as I sat up and glanced around, I didn’t see anyone. Not a soul.

I was about to stand up, but I heard the click of a record player needle connecting with vinyl. The sharp noise somehow rooted me to the fabric.

*My Dark Star* began playing in the background.

When I turned forward, there he was. Materialized from God knows where.

He appeared older than me by a decade or so, maybe in his late fifties. The man sported a cheap, ill-fitting blue checkered suit jacket with black chinos. His face held a warm smile and a pair of those New Year’s Eve novelty glasses, blue eyes peeking through the circles of the two number-nines in 1995.

The figure stared at me, lifted a finger to the corner of his mouth, and waited.

I knew what he wanted. Without thinking, I obliged.

I smiled too.

He nodded, brought a camera up to his eye, and snapped a polaroid.

The flash of light was blinding. For a few seconds, all I could see was white. Screams erupted around me, erasing the pleasant racket of a party. Then, I heard the roaring crackle of a fire.

Slowly, my whiteout faded. The clamor of death quieted in tandem. My surroundings returned to normal, too. No more knickknacks or family photos: just a vacant, depressing, unrenovated home.

The man was also gone, but something replaced him. Like the scratched-out people, it was human-shaped, but it had much more definition. A seven-foot tall, thickly-built stick figure looming motionless in front of me. If there was a person under there, I couldn’t tell. If it had skin, I couldn’t see it.

All I could appreciate were the polaroids.

Thousands of nearly identical images seemed to form its body. They jutted out of the entity at chaotic-looking angles: reptilian scales that had become progressively overcrowded, each one now fighting to maintain a tenuous connection to the flesh hidden somewhere underneath.

It didn’t have fingers. Instead, the plastic squares formed a kind of rudimentary claw. Two-thirds down the arms, its upper extremities bifurcated into a pair of saucer-shaped, plate-sized digits.

I watched as the right arm curved towards its belly. The motion was rigid and mechanical, and it was accompanied by the squeaking of plastic rubbing against plastic. It grasped a single picture at the tip of its claw. Assumably the one that had just been taken.

The one that included me.

When it got close, a cluster of photographs on its torso began to rumble and shake. Seconds later, a long, black tongue slithered out between the cramped folds. The tongue writhed over the new picture, manically licking it until it was covered in gray-yellow saliva.

Then, the tongue receded back into its abdomen, like an earthworm into the soil. Once it had vanished, the entity creaked its right arm at the elbow so it could reach its chest, pushing the polaroid against its sternum.

The claw pulled back, and it stuck.

Another for the collection.

An icy grip clamped down on my wrist.

I turned my head. There was a scratched-out, colorless hand over mine.

My eyes traced the appendage up to its origin, but they didn’t need to. I already knew what I was about to see.

The sofa seemed to stretch on for miles.

Countless scratched-out heads turned to face me, creating a wave down the line. Everyone wanted to see the newcomer, even the oldest shadows at the very, very end.

I did not feel terror.

I experienced a medley of distinct sensations, but none of them were negative.

Peace. Comfort. Fufillment.

Safety. Appreciation.

Love.

Ever since the polaroid snapped, I’ve been smiling.

I can't stop.

My body has this propensity towards substance dependency. I had horrible SSRI withdrawal when I was a kid. Due to being forced onto SSRIs against my will and then receiving really sporadic access to my medication. THANKS MOM. 

Anyhow, my withdrawal from caffeine is about as bad. If I go off caffeine completely, my OCD symptoms get extremely severe and I also get very physically ill.   
  
I tried to go off coffee for religious reasons, years back. And I made it to the other side of the headaches, nausea, back pain, etc.. But once I made it through, my OCD symptoms stayed worse than normal. Because they return to their natural baseline. By which I mean: caffeine somewhat treats my OCD. 

That's why I ultimately decided to stay on it, despite religious proscriptions. I have a medical excuse :P 

But anyhow. I had stomach issues the past few days and I decided to reduce the strength and frequency of my coffee. 

And, since I had not gone off coffee completely, I did not get severe physical symptoms and thus did not immediately clock that I was in withdrawal. 

But my OCD symptoms suddenly got WAY WORSE. I called an emergency appointment with my therapist. 

Diary, you don't even know the hell I was in. There's no point describing it to you. It's always guilt oriented, I'll say that much. 

But I somehow did start to suspect that my perceptions might be an illusion. 

And I restored my caffeine intake. 

And the world resolved itself back into focus, like putting on a pair of glasses. And I could see that my previous thoughts had been an illusion. 

How embarrassing. What to tell my therapist at the emergency appointment...  
  
But the restored caffeine levels not only chased away the illusion, but also put me into a state of euphoria.   
  
A mental state I was wary of. Because, surely it's neurochemically the flip side of anguish. Surely it comes at some later cost.   
  
But knowledge of the cause does not dispel the state of being. So I had no choice but to feel it. To ride it out.

And I'm almost sure I have told you about such a feeling before.   
  
The slice of life euphoria. The laundromat feeling. The early morning feeling. The-great-love-for and interconnectedness-with all of humanity feeling. The everything is so deeply meaningful feeling. The: I remember the end of the book and we all get a happy ending, feeling.   
  
Everything and everyone was deeply beautiful. 

Probably still are, it just isn't something we can directly experience all the time. The truth of it remains but our vision of it goes blurry.  

The feeling is fading. But I have a little of the residual of it, still. 

I'll catch it again on the flip side, I guess. For now, I'll ride even keel for a stretch. 

Then sometime I'll dip back down into intolerable anguish.

And eventually I'll get to return to the early morning laundromat euphoria once again.",1,1754612656.0,deardiary,0,1.0,False

*Ready to stop guessing if your resume hits the mark?*  
[**FirstImpressionAI**](https://firstimpressionai.app/) helps job seekers focus on the right things by showing where they stand — and how to improve — before they submit their application.

# Why Resumes Get Lost in the Void

Today, almost all medium and large employers use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to manage the flood of resumes they receive. These systems automatically parse and score resumes against job descriptions, looking for specific keywords. Studies show that **more than 75 % of resumes never reach human eyes**[finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/75-resumes-never-read-human-174855340.html#:~:text=Three,list%20recruiters%20never%20find%20you). This means you can be perfectly qualified and still be rejected if your resume doesn’t “speak ATS”.

According to industry research, nearly **99 % of Fortune 500 companies** and about **70 % of large companies** rely on ATS platforms[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=The%20ATS%20Market). **Seventy percent of resumes that don’t match an ATS’s criteria are removed**[selectsoftwarereviews.com](https://www.selectsoftwarereviews.com/blog/applicant-tracking-system-statistics#:~:text=The%20ATS%20Market). This is why tailoring each application matters — but doing it manually for every job is exhausting.

# Meet FirstImpressionAI

[FirstImpressionAI ](https://firstimpressionai.app/)solves the ATS problem by combining artificial intelligence with human‑centred design. Instead of guessing which keywords matter, you upload your resume and paste the job ad. Within seconds, our GPT‑4o‑powered engine:

* **Calculates a match score** — shows exactly how well your resume aligns with the role.
* **Identifies gaps** — pinpoints missing skills, experience or keywords.
* **Generates a personalised cover letter** — not generic fluff, but a letter tailored to address your specific strengths and bridge the gaps.

It’s like having a career coach, hiring manager and AI assistant rolled into one. You see what employers see before you apply, and you get guidance on how to improve.

# Built for Scale and Security

As a cybersecurity engineer, I refused to take shortcuts. FirstImpressionAI is **entirely built on Microsoft Azure**, with serverless functions handling processing and secure AI deployments:

Security comes first: JWT-based authentication, rate limiting, encrypted storage, input sanitisation and continuous AI-assisted vulnerability assessments are all baked in. You can trust us with your data.

# Why We Skipped the “MVP”

Many founders launch a stripped‑down minimum viable product, then rewrite it later. After years of building secure systems, I realised that **building for scale from day one** doesn’t necessarily take more time; it just requires smart planning. So we built FirstImpressionAI with production‑grade architecture and real security. Auto‑scaling and zero technical debt mean we can focus on features instead of fire‑fighting.

# How to Use It

1. **Upload your resume** (no data is stored after processing).
2. **Paste the job description.**
3. **Get your match score and gap analysis.**
4. **Generate a tailored cover letter** that highlights your strengths and addresses any missing requirements.
5. **Iterate** with instant feedback.

Your first three cover letters and fit checks are **free** — no credit card required. If you like what you see, unlimited access costs less than a couple of coffees a month.

# Roadmap: Even More Value Coming

This is just the beginning. We’re working on:

* **ATS‑friendly resume generator** — craft a new resume based on your job match analysis.
* **Analytics dashboard** — track your job application performance over time.
* **Interview prep tools** — generate custom questions based on the role and your experience.
* **Recruiter tools** — help recruiters identify top candidates and connect them directly with job seekers.

But it still hurts. I have an awkward personality. I'm not gonna label it with a fancy word, because at the end of the day, it is what it is. One of those people that can't hold a conversation. And because of that, law school has been a torture. I rarely click with anyone and I have very few close relationships in my life and I'm ok with that. It's just it ain't gonna cut it for law school. For the life of me I. Can. Not. Network. I tried. Many many times. The convo fizzles out after 5 mins. 

It also affects my interviewing skills. Like I give all the ""right"" answers. I impress them. But there's just something off putting about me. At the end, they'd be like ""Do we want to make the office awkward?"" and it shows...

The worst part? Apparently, I'm actually very good at lawyering, especially dealing with clients. Intake, prep, research, drafting, you name it. I don't struggle to have a professtional relationship at all. I know what to do and what to say. And I enjoy it a lot. I got lucky to find a summer position and on my last day, my supervising lawyer said ""to be honest, we did not expect you to perform this well when we met. But you surprised us. You're ready to practice. Just work on your social skills."" Whenever I go out for a coffee with a lawyer whether the ones in our firm or outside, I just usually sit quiet and sip my coffee in silence and they nervously look around. It would be pretty funny if it wasn't this sad.

And I can fake it to some extent, but smart people can tell. Especially if you're looking for it, you'd spot it right away. Now I'm getting rejection after rejection for articling interviews. I don't have problem getting interviews. I rarely get rejected or ghosted when I apply. It's just when we meet for an interview, you can tell that something changes after the first few mins of the encounter.

To the issue. I feel like he does nothing for our relationship, there is no effort, ever. Whenever we go out to eat I look up and decide the restaurant, if we travel I decide the when, where, which hotel, buy the tickets and plan everything around it. I want him to put more effort in to things that benefit our relationship and I’ve told him that many times but I see no effort. 

On his birthday we went to Amsterdam, I bought him a watch, wrote him a sentimental note, I planned! I put in effort! Today it was my birthday and guess what we did? Nothing. I woke up, waited by his side for him to wake up for a couple of hours, he woke up and wished me a happy birthday, kissed me, he was loving, then he called his friend on FaceTime and they talked. We didn’t go anywhere today, he didn’t get me anything, not even a note, no loving message no nothing. He made dinner which he rarely does in it was nice but I honestly don’t think it’s enough. I’m not expecting gifts, I’m not expecting him to take me out to fancy restaurants but I was expecting some effort, maybe breakfast? Maybe he could take me out for coffee? Picnic? Anything really.

They taped the interview together over breakfast at the fantastic Day By Day Cafe on 7th Street in Saint Paul.

A transcript of the interview was published on MPRNews.org. Allegedly, the published transcript was edited for “length and clarity”.

But I believe the transcript was edited to bury the terrifying truth.

If you listen to the unedited audio version of the interview, things get interesting at around the three minute mark. Mr. Lindahl asks if the restaurant serves poached eggs.

The server informs him that poached eggs are indeed available. So far, everything seems fine.

But the most important meal of the day is about to take a shocking turn.

Mr. Lindahl proceeds to order FOUR POACHED EGGS, A GLASS OF WATER, AND **NOTHING** ELSE!

And Nina Moini just rolls with it, like that’s a perfectly sane and normal breakfast order.

How can anyone call themselves a journalist and not have follow up questions?

Four poached eggs. No toast. No coffee. Just four runny eggs and a glass of water.

And then they went and buried it. Because they know how bad this looks.

1mkg8qz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mkg8qz,"are veneers my only option? non-smoker, 22 years old","I have severe tooth decay all through my mouth. It’s a long and complicated backstory that isn’t necessary to get into but basically, braces left on for wayyyyy too long (parents were divorced and parent with financial responsibility wouldn’t pay the bill, other parent was legally not allowed to, and the orthodontist refused to take them off even though my teeth were rotting), and my favorite snack being straight lemons and limes as a kid, absolutely wrecking my enamel. You can literally see the outline of the brackets from my braces on my teeth still, after 10+ years. I do my best to care for my teeth now, but I can’t undo the damage that’s been done, and there’s a LOT. 

I currently need at least 6 root canals, 5 crowns, and essentially have cavities at varying severities on every tooth. I already have 1 crown due to root resorption, and another one which you’ll see in the video (link) that was a crown but had to be broken off to do an emergency root canal after the tooth abscessed. 

A dentist that I had seen last year essentially told me that my only option are porcelain veneers. My enamel is gone, my teeth are so incredibly sensitive from the fact that it’s missing and that they’re riddled with cavities. They’ll be extremely structurally compromised since half of them will be made of composite, which is bound to not match perfectly just because it never really does. Now, my teeth are in worse condition than usual because i am overdue for a cleaning. They are very clearly stained from coffee but I can’t even whiten them due to the abundance of cavities and their extreme sensitivity. I literally can’t drink unless it’s through a straw. I just graduated from college and I’m trying to sort out a new dentist to actually get everything done. I have a job so I can finally afford to pay myself and I want it all done asap so it stops affecting my life. 

Is there any hope for my natural teeth or should I just give into veneers? Obviously there’s nothing wrong with them, i’m just worried about the price tag. My teeth are my biggest insecurity and I would love to be able to smile without shame, something I haven’t been able to do since before I got my braces over 10 years ago. Just looking for some advice please. And trust me I know it’s bad. Please no lecturing on oral hygiene, or the importance of regular cleanings- I am doing everything in my power to make sure they’re taken care of NOW. I can’t go back in time to fix things I did when I was younger.

Nose: This is super reminiscent of a SFTB that has a dump date of 7-15-2021 from warehouse H 1st floor. I know this is supposed to be a blended batch but I wonder if there is any correlation from where they picked the barrels. Let me know in the comments. Artificial grape and uncut grass are super prevalent with vanilla coffee cake like notes following up. Despite being a 12 year, there is a young wheat hay like note on this which is really surprising. Somehow I think its not unwelcome in this fashion. 

Palate: Hot on the first sip and a rush of the grape intensity. Viscous mouthfeel but not quite on that creamy level that everyone is wanting. Heavy oak notes immediately after.

Finish: Boy its been a while that I've gotten a kentucky hug from a sub 100 proofer but it doesnt build in the belly. Cola notes become prevalent on the second sip and finishes with a little tannic oak. If you are looking for sweet, I'm sorry to say this ain't it chief.

Instead of letting chaos rule, we're here to guide you to the gadgets that can help you smoothly navigate any frantic day, from a crazy morning to a well-deserved evening of relaxation.

Here are our top picks to ensure your Friday (and every day) is perfectly streamlined, not ""freakier.""



# 1. Taming the Chaotic Morning: A Smart Start to Your Day



A ""freakier"" Friday often starts with a frantic morning. Smart tech is designed to put your morning routine on autopilot, so you can focus on what's important—like finding your keys.

* **The Smart Coffee Maker:** Nothing tames chaos like a hot cup of coffee. With a smart coffee maker, you can schedule your brew from your phone the night before, so it’s ready to go the second you wake up.
* **Smart Speakers:** Use your smart speaker to set reminders, check the weather, or even start a pre-programmed ""morning routine"" that turns on the lights and plays your favorite music, all with a simple voice command.
* **The Smart Toothbrush:** A smart toothbrush with an integrated app helps you stay on track with your dental health, a small bit of routine that brings a sense of normalcy to any hectic day.



# 2. Mastering the Hectic Workday: Tech for Focus and Calm



The workday can feel like a body-swap in itself, juggling multiple roles and responsibilities. The right tech can help you maintain focus and reduce stress.

* **Noise-Cancelling Headphones:** Block out the distractions of a busy home or office. A good pair of noise-cancelling headphones is a must-have for a chaotic day, allowing you to create a bubble of focus.
* **Smart Air Purifiers:** A stressful day can feel heavy, but an air purifier can make your workspace feel fresh and clean. Many smart models have a silent mode that lets you work without any distracting noise.
* **Smart Water Bottles:** Staying hydrated is often the first thing we forget on a busy day. A smart water bottle tracks your water intake and sends reminders to your phone, ensuring you’re taking care of yourself.



# 3. The Perfect End: Smart Gear for Your Evening Wind-Down



After a chaotic day, the goal is to unwind, relax, and make sure your evening is the opposite of ""freakier.""

* **Smart Lighting:** Turn your home into a sanctuary. Smart lights can be dimmed to a warm, relaxing glow, creating a calm atmosphere. You can even program them to slowly fade to darkness to help you get ready for bed.
* **Smart Aromatherapy Diffusers:** Scent has a powerful effect on mood. A smart diffuser can fill your home with a calming fragrance like lavender or chamomile, a small luxury that makes a big difference.
* **Massage Guns:** A massage gun can work wonders on sore muscles after a long, stressful week. Smart models can connect to an app to offer guided routines tailored to your needs.



# Tame the Chaos, One Gadget at a Time



The movie ""Freakier Friday"" reminds us that life can get crazy, but with the right tools, you can handle anything it throws at you. By making smart choices in your tech, you can transform a chaotic day into a well-managed one.

(We have separate bedrooms) I have had a male partner for 20 yrs+. She gets increasing jealous over me, especially when I'm with my BF or kids. Last week I went to my Daughters to go bingo and my fella went to play PlayStation with her BF, we got bk to my Daughters and had a few coffees and I had a shower, got a txt off (sister) aka where was I. Got no she was sat on her bed and I said hello and we was bk, IGNORED!! She screamed at me me asking why I had brought that 'useless ballbag' with me and then decided to square upto my partner and when he wouldn't take her on she (VERY DRUNK) SWUNG at my me twice after me asking her 10+ times to leave my bedroom, I'm ashamed to say I punched her in the face. She left soon after to go bk to her mouldy ridden nasty flat. That was last Saturday, she apologised on Tuesday and said she could stay as long as we put proper rules down. My BF laughed at her apology as it's not the first time shes done this... ×15!! Her flat is a hell hole, the landlord won't do anything about it and I feel bad if I have to to put her bk in that situation. What do you all think?

1mkfy1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Custody/comments/1mkfy1z/usa_flfound_evidence_of_substance_use_around_my/,"[USA, FL]Found evidence of substance use around my child","I’ve posted in here before about my situation. 
I’ve become aware today that my coparent (m27)has been abusing lots of different substances which I already suspected from the lack of visits the past few months. I didn’t realize it was as bad as it is until I was made aware today. I thought he was partying and whatnot but not when he was around our child (F2 3/4). I saw messages of him discussing with his drug dealer prices and what types of drugs and then my coparent stated he had our child but that he would drop her off with his dad for a few hours so he could go hangout. Then the messages have the address shared and him saying he’s on his way but that he has to pick her up around whatever time it said. This has me freaking out. Knowing he went and bought drugs and probably did them and then proceeded to drive in a vehicle with my child has me freaking out. 
That was the major message that had me worried but there was a lot more. The drugs he’s doing are crazy drugs like ketamine, cocaine, mushrooms, acid, nitrous oxide. 
I was told by my lawyer previously that I should keep our agreed arrangement going until our case goes to trial and we get a court order as to not alienate him, but I also had no real proof of his drug use or admissible in court anyways. 
I have pictures of what his house looks like when I’ve been to pick her up and he always has marijuana and paraphernalia etc on the coffee table where she can easily reach and now that I’m aware he’s using other drugs and having them in his house I’m so worried she could get ahold of them and die or that she’d get super sick and he wouldn’t help her as to not get himself in trouble. A few messages he discussed mushroom chocolates that got him extremely messed up. And she loves chocolate she would easily eat something chocolate not knowing any better. I’m so worried and want to deny anymore visits. I tried calling my lawyer but he was in depositions all day and could only talk for a quick 5 minutes I was able to tell him what I’ve found out and he said this is huge but we will have to discuss it another time so I have no idea what to do. He is supposed to get her tomorrow for the weekend and I’m so scared I really want to deny him this weekend until I can speak to my lawyer but have no idea how to go about it. He’s already texted me tonight asking me if he could get her tonight and she skip preschool tomorrow and then he asked if he could get her early atleast after I didn’t respond I have no idea what to say and now I’m terrified to send her to school and he’ll just pick her up without my knowledge or approval and the daycare has told me they cannot deny him access to pick her up without a court order and we are still in our custody battle with no judge signed court order. I sent messages to my lawyer asking if we could file an emergency order but haven’t received an answer I’m so worried for her safety, I can not allow her to go there knowing the things I know. Does anyone have any advice?


Also to add he has been behind on child support for 4-5 months but in the messages I saw he has been buying lots of different women tickets to music festivals and buying hotels and buying drugs and going to the casino and losing and buying scratch offs and losing. He told me he quit his job to go independent (sells insurance) but that it takes time to make money and he’d have some eventually and that he is going to be moving in with his dad into his spare room.

He says I'm not making sense. He does not find it rude. Says he will eat the food I cook too.

Some back story...
He is overweight. He regularly talks about needing to lose weight. He turns me down for intimacy fairly regularly because he is self conscious of his body. But he will complain that we aren't intimate more often. He drinks about 1000 calories a day in blended coffees and energy drinks and complains of being tired all the time.  
I cook healthy food for us. I have lost 40 lbs in the past 6 months. I pack healthy food for his lunches at work. He often will not eat it and order fast food delivered or eat pb&j sandwiches. The lean meats and veggies get thrown away.

So I don't know if I'm the AH or just annoyed and feeling disrespected.  I am tired of hearing him complain daily and not do anything about it.

31 married 7 years to them 26 with a toddler together.  DDAY was 2 years ago. We have been trying R since. We’ve tried counseling but was not compatible with our counselor. Ever since we haven’t gone but tried to R by ourselves.

I admit. I was wrong. I cheated since beginning of our relationship. I used dating apps constantly and spoke to different people and shared images. I was looking for validation and I was selfish. I ended up meeting with 1  and nothing happened. I was not planning to make it a physical affair. It was a Spurr of the moment invite for some coffee.(not trying to justify. That’s what happened). I also hid our finances from them. Always made it seem okay. I lied to them constantly.

DDAY. They was devastated. I felt like disappearing. I’ve never wanted to end myself after seeing them so hurt. We had the white picket fence family image. Their world was destroyed that day.

Since DDAY I’ve deleted all my social media to make them feel better (per their request). I’ve dedicated my life to them. I’ve made sure that whatever they wants they  will have and I will abide by them. We’ve had our good and bad cycles. I’ve worked on myself because they wanted me to work on myself

They recently went away from work. They came home and I knew right away something was wrong. I confronted them. My world came crashing this time. They wants a divorce.

They said that since the trip they realized how toxic our relationship was and realized that they does not want this cycle to keep going. They said they felt empty whenever we’re together. They loves and cares for me but doesn’t have anymore romantic feelings.

We had another talk this morning and they said they hasn’t actually decided yet but willing to try therapy and wants to separate for now and have space.

I looking for advice or experience. I desperate. I scared. I know this is prolly how they felt during DDAY. Is there any chance we can salvage what’s left? I looking for a counselor that will see us asap in  hopes we can salvage this.

1mkfpr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpeculativeEvolution/comments/1mkfpr9/project_domestic/,Project 'DOMESTIC',"(This text has been translated into English, so there may be grammatical inconsistencies)

I'm developing a speculative evolution project called 
DOMESTIC, which consists of a planetary-sized (approximately the diameter of Mercury) altered living room, called ALIVEingRoom, seeded with current household pests common in this environment. I probably won't have much time to explore this concept, as I have other projects to work on, but I still wanted to share it with you, since spec evo is one of my favorite topics, and it's comforting to see that there's a sub full of people with the same interests.

 PREMISE:

""In the mid-2550s, humanity, now technologically advanced, mastering the art of using renewable resources as fuel and thus manipulating matter on a planetary scale (basically like futuristic engineers), conducted a biological experiment that consisted of building a planetary-sized replica of an average early 21st-century living room and seeding it with household pests typical of this environment, providing customized resources with planetary engineering, gravity, and sufficient oxygen for the animals to thrive. With planetary engineering, it was also possible to create a relativity of time in the built environment, with hundreds of millions of years inside the ALIVEingRoom being only tens of decades outside. Thus, the scientists supervising the project could witness evolution occurring in real time, and their children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren could also witness the experiment taking place. From this perspective, the use of planetary engineering; real-time evolution; and a system of temperature, atmosphere, and day-night cycle, which can act  for centuries without pause; it has made ALIVEingRoom one of the greatest experiments of all humanity, leaving a mark of its inspiring advancement. Even if humans in general become extinct, other intelligent civilizations, and perhaps even descendants of humanity, would recognize with prestige the scientific possibilities that the ALIVingRoom project has brought.

This gigantic, human-created cubicle would be an exact replica of a modern living room, complete with replicas of two sofas, a rug, tiles, a coffee table, a rack, and a set of cushions. These colossal pieces of furniture, such as the sofa, rug, and cushions, are covered in hybrid plants known as ""tissuephytes,"" which consist of synthetic plants created by humans. They are functional autotrophic living beings, but which have characteristics very similar to wool, silk, and other fabrics, in addition to having colors identical to the dyed versions of these materials.  The tissuephytes are practically a link between the natural and the industrial, a reflection of humanity's advancement in the 26th century. In addition to these altered plants, many other elements that make up the ALIVEingRoom landscape contain this blend of the natural and the human-made, as evidenced by the extremely unique and even unusual meteorology and biomes.

THE HUMAN VERSION OF METEOROLOGY:

For this experiment, a system was created to accurately simulate meteorology, the diurnal cycle, and atmospheric phenomena. This invention is essential for maintaining local life, and its changes stimulate the evolution of the beings living here.

Atmosphere - A climate similar to Earth's was created, only with subtle climatic variations. In addition to gravity and increased oxygen, this system stimulates the growth and development of animals (chordates and mainly arthropods).  This atmospheric simulation is programmed to create slow, gradual, yet random climate changes, thus purposefully nudging animals to adapt, evolution to occur, biological explosions and extinctions to occur, niches to be occupied and modified, and the evolution of beings during the experiment.

Light and Diurnal Cycle - Scientists at Planetary Engineers developed square fluorescent lights the size of cities. Two lights are located on the roof of the building, one illuminating the west and the other the east. Together, they simulate the conditions necessary for life that a star provides, but without impacting the beings with solar radiation or extremely strong UV rays. The regions below them end up being extremely hot, but otherwise, they do an incredible job of sustaining the life of the animals in the building.  In order to simulate the diurnal cycle, for twelve hours (inside the ALIVEingRoom), the lights remain unchanged, while for the other twelve hours, the lights decrease their brightness by 90%, lowering the temperatures and resulting in a near darkness that plagues the cubicle, until the cycle repeats.

Rain and Water Absorption - To maintain life on the planet, pores in the ceiling randomly release a constant amount of water into the interior of the building, lasting from a few minutes to hours. This system acts as an irrigation system with the same purpose as rainfall. Some time after the rain ends, to prevent flooding and habitat destruction, a drainage system beneath the entire ALIVEingRoom absorbs excess water from the surface, storing and filtering it, and sending it for later use in the irrigation system. A sustainable water cycle created to sustain life in an unnatural environment.

BIOMES:

Couch Plateau (Meridian) - Located vertically on the eastern side of the cubicle. A slightly warm temperature environment. In the more stable areas of the plateau, it consists of a vast savannah, covered by slightly tall, low-lying tissuephytes, which make up the environment like a large forest, with very few tissuephyte trees in the landscape.

 Carpet Swamp - Located in the center of the cubicle. This biome is extremely humid, and also quite wet, due to the presence of creeping tissuephytes that retain rainwater and release it into the soil in dangerous situations. It also contains the tallest tissuephyte trees in the entire cubicle, which spread their leaves to the sides in search of light, creating a dense forest environment.

Couch Plateau (Parallel): Located horizontally on the western side of the cubicle. The most stable areas of the couch consist of a kind of tundra, creeping tissuephytes adapted to slightly cooler temperatures, and a slightly larger presence of medium-sized tissuephyte trees.

Floor Desert - Located covering the entire cubicle floor, leaving only gaps between them. These are a series of large, symmetrically positioned, equilateral squares, quite similar to ceramic floor tiles. They are covered in a type of ""ceramic dust"" whose composition is very similar to sand.  The entire biome has a dry climate, in addition to the occurrence of strong winds.

Cushions - Located mostly scattered throughout the sofas, with some in specific spots in the Tile Desert. It's the most temperature-neutral environment on this ""planet,"" consisting of a rocky base, a thin layer of soil, completely filled with a tangle of tall tissuephyte plants that constantly intertwine like strands of steel wool. The closer to the bottom of the tangle, the lower the oxygen content, so the creatures living deeper are usually extremophiles or parasites of these plants.

Global Oceanic Networks - Located around the entire cubicle, covering the spaces between the squares of the ceramic floor. What on Earth are gaps created to prevent the tiles from breaking during thermal expansion, in ALIVEingRoom are filled by two oceanic saltwater networks whose waters flow from north to south through the gaps in the entire tile.  These oceans are approximately 20,000 meters deep, and despite their narrow width by Earthly standards, they contain an incredible diversity of animals, plants, and other beings. We have the Northern Oceanic Network, with dense, grayish waters, and the Southern Oceanic Network, with murky, brownish waters.

Walls and ceiling - Walls located around the ecosystem, enclosing it in a slightly rectangular square; the ceiling located above the entire structure, enclosing it. They are a set of five colossal, narrow, slightly rectangular hexahedrons made of a material consisting of an artificial mixture of porcelain and matiz rocks. Essentially, these surfaces are quite poor in biodiversity, harboring only beings adapted to long periods without nutrition, or deeply extremophilic beings. However, the large cubic-rectangular space these structures provide is a haven for aerial beings, which are free to fly over this enormous area.

Radiant zones - These consist of locations very close to or below fluorescent lights. This is quite extreme, as the proximity results in very bright landscapes and extremely high temperatures. A difficult environment during the day but normal at night.

Dark Zones - These consist of locations located in the shadows of furniture in contact with the light. This can lead to very dark environments with extremely low temperatures, where darkness is practically eternal.

ANIMALS USED:

With the premise of the experiment being to observe evolution in action live, the ecosystem was seeded with unwanted animals, typically found wandering around a living room (the building that inspired ALIVEingRoom). This allowed them to adapt and evolve in this unique environment.  These animals include:

- Tropical house gecko (Hemidactylus mabouia)
- Southern house mosquito (Culex quinquefasciatus)
- Silverfish (Lepisma saccharina)
- Cellar spider (Pholcus phalangioides)
- Termite (Syntermes dirus)
- House dust mite (Blomia tropicalis)
- Pharaoh ant (Monomorium pharaonis)

________________________________________

And so, DOMESTIC would be based on these animals being introduced to the ALIVEingRoom, and along with the tissuephytes, evolving for millions of years within the ALIVEingRoom, which from the outside, would seem like mere decades.

Feel free to give your opinions and help me (if you'd like) with suggestions for the project. But beyond that, I would like feedback on the development of arthropods that were seeded in this unique environment by Earth standards. Do you think it's plausible that, given the environment and adaptive opportunities, arthropods could evolve convergently with chordates? In the sense of walking with their legs below the body (instead of sideways, as with modern insects), intelligence comparable to chordates, warm-bloodedness, and increased adaptability.",4,1754609827.0,SpeculativeEvolution,0,1.0,False

Since COVID(which being like a long long time ago) , I’ve spent a lot of time alone, and now I feel like I don’t know how to connect with people anymore. It feels so awkward, and I get this weird sense of being out of practice socially. I’m not sure how to break the ice or maintain friendships, and it’s honestly starting to make me feel more isolated.

I cry about it sometimes, and honestly, I end up feeling sorry for myself. But I don’t want to do that anymore. I know I deserve good things, and I’m a caring, nice person.

42M, 5’6”, 124lbs, non smoker here. Yesterday morning I accidentally shattered a coffee mug into my own hand, and ended up needing to go to the ER. A piece of the mug had cut a huge, deep flap in the pad of my left thumb and I wasn’t able to stop the bleeding on my own.

In the ER, they gave me some numbing shots into my thumb and put in 5 stitches to help “tack the flap down” in the hopes that it will re-fuse with the rest of my thumb as it heals. The doc referred to it as an avultion. 

I continued to bleed a lot after receiving the stitches, so they put a piece of Surgicell on it. Then they wrapped it tightly with cotton and wrapped the cotton in gauze. 

I was instructed to remove the gauze & cotton bandaging after 24 hours, but to leave the Surgicell until it falls off on its own, which they say could take a couple of days. I was told not to let any of it get wet for a couple of days. 

I’m currently trying to unwrap the gauze from my thumb, but it seems that multiple layers of gauze are caught on my stitches. (Photos here: https://imgur.com/a/l3rNFg5)

Since the stitches are so new (and painful), and since I was bleeding so much that it required Surgicell, I’m very hesitant to remove the gauze forcefully from my stitches. And I haven’t even gotten to the cotton yet, which I expect is going to be fused to the bloody Surgicell… which I also don’t know how to handle since I was told not to get things wet for a couple days and I don’t want to restart the bleeding. 

I don’t have a clear view of the stitches to even see if I can cut excess thread off or anything. So, uh, what are my options right now? I’m trying to follow the directions, but it’s all going wrong so far.

Finding Grace’ A latino story, with Jenna Ortega

Not really remembering anything from before, Before, a dark raven haired Latina, brown eyed girl named Jenna Ortega’ had awakened into a world in which she would now find herself. Living in a world now where she see meets people that have since passed. But from within her new world that she now lives in, along with the people that she meets along the way. While riding her bike discovering new trails that would show her a life that was once hers. 

From waking up to looking out her window setting there looking out into a world that was still very much new to her, thinking to herself as she sat there. Looking as the sun’s light glimmered onto the street in front of as people was coming and going. People that was still very new to her. In a world that was still very much new to her. People that she was soon about to meet as the sun’s light glimmered into her room from her window while still giving her the feeling of that she has always been here. 

For when you wake up in another life being someone else, not knowing anyone around you. But at the same time having the feeling that you have always been lived here being the person that you are. The person that upon looking into a mirror, looking at a young girl with anticipation of what was about to be, 

For Jenna’ a very outgoing dark haired girl, That very much knew how to handle things that would come her way. Knowing that everyday brought something new to her, giving her the feeling of a a new path to discover in her life with new adventure’s. Taking her to different places in and around the area, finding new biking paths that showed her different areas not only on the path. 

But a new path showing her a life that was once hers, a life that she now had no memory of after waking up to being the girl that she was now. A young Latino girl, who very much knew the path that she wanted to take. But finding which path that would take her to that place would be a challenge altogether. A challenge that she was ready to take, but for Jenna’ herself and her bike was all that she needed. While meeting new and different people along the way. 

But while at the same time, meeting new people while finding herself coming closer to in her life. But as Jenna’ would quickly get dressed, anticipating what the day may bring her. Wearing a black tee and a pair of cut at the knees jeans! Not forgetting about her shoes that just fit her personality that she was to everyone around her. 

Running out the door grabbing her bike in her way with high anticipation what the day may bring her, anticipation of new path in her life. Ready to see the path that lyes ahead of her, jumping on her bike just as her neighbor Lou Diamond Phillips’ shouted out to Jenna’ saying to her

“Hey Jenna’ don’t let those boys show you up today” 

And with a wave to Lou from Jenna’ just before Jenna’ set off riding her bike into the day, with Lou Diamond Phillips a 63 year old dark haired Latino, was one of first people that Jenna’ had met. With Lou’ being a street smart Latino himself, often found himself teaching Jenna’ all about life and growing up in her new found life. Teaching her all about the streets, and riding, for Lou’ himself also knew a few things about riding a bike himself. 

A girl that wasn’t afraid to express herself, while at the same time excepting a challenge, From anyone that wanted to race her. With her showing them what was! While at the same time! Finding herself coming closer to others, Knowing that the world around her was changing every day seeing and meeting new people along the way. While at the same time! Finding out that some people around her had many stories of their own to share. Finding herself coming close to some. Whether it was as a friend! or like family to her. 

But as Jenna’ quickly got dressed! Grabbing her bike and on her way she went! Not looking back! But only ahead! Ahead to what was to be! As she was now finding herself. Looking out onto a bustling street in front of her, Jenna’ was going to let nothing stand in her way! From doing this run! A run that she had a done dozens of times before. For just as the morning’s sun was making its way into a new day. A new day for her! For everything seemed new to Jenna’

In a way that was just unexplainable to her! For it felt like she had always been here, lived here! And was born here. But unknowingly to her at the moment, the days ahead would show her different paths. Paths that would take her to slowly finding out who she was. For as sat there on her bike, looking down a street just in front of her was that long all downhill from there. But the need to race! The need for speed was there! And she here now and ready for her run.

With her not always having the feeling of really not knowing on how or why she was here. But in a way she felt that she had always been here, but with her having that feeling in her that something felt different about her. Different in a way that no one could describe, but she only knew where she was at the moment! only knowing the moment! 

For this morning was hers, nothing was going to stop her from breaking her prior tries before. Taking one last look around her, just before letting it all go! Feeling the wind push up against her! Speeding in and around cars along the way!

With the feeling of something just being different about still residing within her, more so than usually toady. With the feeling that all of this still felt very new to her, its surroundings, The people, Everything thing about the place. But while everything seemed new to her! It still felt like she belonged here. That she had always been here.

Jenna’ was a young outgoing girl just shy of her 23rd birthday. Growing up in a small town that had a big city feel to it to her. But to Jenna’ it was her home, but she liked to think of it as a sprawling city that one day she would riding her bike through the downtown streets. 

Weaving in and around cars passing by them as the wind blew through her long Raven hair! feeling free from the world around her. Racing was her excitement, and it showed, along with her smile saying it all. Making her way through the towns traffic passing by people with some waving as she passed them by.

With Jenna’ having the feeling of nothing could stop her from trying her best to break her speed time Pryor to each day.  Often finding herself at the other end of the local law enforcement, as officer Cross’ would many times say to her

“Jenna’! Now don’t make me write you a ticket today for speeding!” 

As he would always say laughingly to her. mainly it was just him watching out for her, for her own safety.  But Jenna’ also had someone else watching out for her! A young latino! Named Hector’ With his dark hair brown eyes, And a smile For Jenna’ But Jenna’ was just your typical young brown eyed girl! Who liked her shredded jeans and tee shirt and hoodie living her life! Her way. 

Occasionally finding some of the local boys racing with her trying to out do one another. With Jenna’ being the girl that she was never backing down from a challenge. Finding herself racing through the towns streets, finding herself racing along with one or two others.

Not to say that one of them didn’t catch her eye, But! From time to time, Hector’ very much would catch her eye, for he was the kinda guy that could charm on a dime. A Latino, Who had a keen mind and the street smarts to match! Especially on a bike. Often calling out to Jenna’ saying to her.

“So you think you’re fast huh! Well maybe we can just find out just how fast you can go!”

But at the same time finding himself racing along side of Jenna’ Whether it be on the streets or on one of many mountain trails that surrounded them. Knowing that each had feelings for the other, but never really acting on it. Knowing that Jenna’ was a well to do girl, often finding himself with Jenna’ leaving him with a glance and a smile! as Jenna’ left him looking. And saying to himself “Dam! That’s my girl!”

Just way the way he liked it, always looking and watching out for her. While Jenna’ didn’t have many people in her life or let many get close to her, Hector was different. 

Leaving everyone she met with a smile she was a girl with a slim build standing at around five foot and four inches. Gliding her way through the traffic imagining as if she was racing through the downtown streets of San Francisco. Often finding herself riding her bike for the bike was her life her way of escape. She even had a name for her bike often calling it ‘Quicksilver’ riding her bike faster and farther each day. Finding new trails along the way but with each new trail she would ride. It was like it was showing something to her! As if it was trying to tell her something.

But with each new day bringing something new to her, a new trial, a new street to ride on, and occasionally a new person.

Finding herself Occasionally stopping by the local bike shop finding herself talking to Jack’ for jack was like a big brother to her. One who also knew himself very well on a bike, Jenna’ would often find herself talking to listening to Jack tell her all about his days in the big city. Telling Jrnna’ about his own street races, with Jenna’ always enjoying there talks whenever she was in his shop.

For whenever she was on her bike she felt faster than anyone around her and that there was nothing that she could not do on that bike. One street in particular had a steep incline to it for the street itself was not very long but long enough for what Jenna’ needed it be. 

For it gave her enough speed that it felt as if she could go on forever, Dodging in and out of traffic. But always avoiding the people as she would often came onto the sidewalk bringing a lot of speed passing people as they made their way. 

Sometimes she would dream as if she was riding her bike through the streets of San Francisco or New York. But Life for Jenna’ was here in her hometown it was often just a carefree life for her. More than often finding herself thinking about her life! For oddly enough it just did not feel like it was her life! It felt as if she was living someone else’s life other than her own. 

For many times while riding on one of the many trials outside of town. She would often find herself on a different trail, a trail Leading her to new areas, to new adventures, as if it was showing her thoughts. Thoughts that wasn’t her thoughts, that was as if they belonged to someone else. It was as if she was seeing things as someone else’s was seeing them! 

But for now life for her was just her and her bike the one possession in her life that she most often cared for the most. Making her way through the streets making her way the local coffee shop where she worked. A Coffee Shop, That was owned by Hector’s father.

Also named Hector’ She would also find herself taking with him not only about bikes! But also about different things in general. With one! Being of his son Hector’ for Jenna” very much had a crush on him. Often finding herself dreaming of not only Hector’ but a life being on her own! Making her own way in life on her bike.

Just as a regular would walk in as he often would, setting down to enjoy his morning cup of joe. A regular, who was named Voodoo’ Lawrence Fishburne,or at least his friends would call him that. But Lawrence Fishburne a 64 year old former bike rider himself. Often found himself talking to Jenna Ortega’ telling Jenna’ about his own little bike rides. When he was a bike rider from the city. A regular that Jenna’ came know from their talks at the coffee shop. But not only would he talk to her about bike riding, but he would often talk to Jenna’ about life in general. By helping her to find and make her own path in life. 

For Voodoo’ would often tell Jenna’ about his many adventures aboard and local, telling her that even though there were many great locations about. That there was none like our very own town that we had here, for the many great nights he had here in the mountains when he was younger. Jenna’ always enjoyed there talks often telling him about her own little adventures in the mountains.

But oddly enough whenever Voodoo’ would talk about the town that they were in, that he would say that this is where he wanted to be buried. That For all of his many travels to many different places, seeing all that he had seen, and that in the end that this was his home. That this was where he wanted his final resting place to be.

For often Jenna’ would find herself in the mountains just outside of the town riding her bike on some of its many trails one particular. A trial that she would often ride a trial where she was at the moment making her way through it. Gliding past the trees catching glimpses of the sun as its light glimmered through the trees around her.

It was a warm day as she could feel and see the nature of the forest all around her with nothing but blue sky ahead of her. Approaching the place where she would often come. Jenna’ would find herself setting there on her bike overlooking a ravine where in the distance she could see the town in which she had grew up in. 

She would often refer to it as Angels Ravine, For to anyone standing there could look as if they were looking out into a dream. A Ravine that seemed to go on forever over into the valley ahead. It was almost as if you were an Angel, looking out from Heaven itself. For it was a quit place it was her place. Often finding herself there where she would come to often just settling there looking down onto the town. It was a small town but it was her home, it was where she would come to know. With everyone helping Jenna in their own way to find her path in life. A path that would eventually lead to her right path in life. 

But just on the other side of Angels Ravine, was a mountain trail that many bikers dared not to challenge. But not Jenna’ for she knew one day that she would conquer that path, but unknowingly at the time. She would find herself with Hector and others in a challenge that they would never forget. Finding herself there on many occasions just to relax, to think about her life! Thinking about her life growing up for she didn’t have any family or many friends. Or at least any that she could remember. 

And the few she had, had moved away after High school whether it was for college or just Life itself. But a couple of people who she find herself talking to or occasionally racing against here in the city streets. Or on one of the many trails that was on the outskirts of town, Jenna’ found that life for her was there in the mountains along with her bike.

But as the day grew long with Jenna’ setting there on the ledge looking down into the ravine below her Knowing that she should be heading back. For the darkness never really bothered her for she had many times ridden back in the dark under a nights sky. 

For Jenna’ loved riding at night under a starlit sky above her for being alone with nothing but her and stars in the sky. For she knew the area really well and enjoyed its peace that it brought to her but also kept a light on her. that she could attach to the front of her bike as she rode through the trails she could feel nothing but a somber feeling all over her. But as the nights cool breeze blew against her sending feelings of thoughts that would sometimes come over her. 

Thoughts that oddly enough did not feel like her thoughts, thoughts that often would feel like they belonged to someone else’s. Finding herself later that night after arriving back at her apartment the rain had just begun to fall standing there in the rain. Thinking to herself a thought that would often come to her 

“If I am not me then who am I “

A thought that she often would find herself thinking about but always keeping them to herself. While also thinking to herself who else would she tell for oddly enough it seemed that it was just only her. Having no family at least none that she ever knew of it for it had always just been her by herself. 

With only the people around her that was already there making her way inside setting down into her cozy little chair. Occasionally as Jenna’ sat there she would often think about Hector’ thinking about the many trips that they had made up to Angels ravine

As they sat there looking out over into the town that was just ahead of them. They would often set there talking to each other as Hector would often put his arm around Jenna’ as Jenna’ would often find herself leaning up against Hector’ as he would tell her all about his own little adventures in life. 

But as Jenna’ sat there thinking back on her and Hector’ setting There listening to the rain falling just outside as it came down. Setting there thinking as she would often do about her life then slowly as she would began to fall asleep listening to the rain. Just as a dream would come to her. 

A dream that she would often have a dream that she would often find herself thinking about a lot. Thinking was this her life? But as she dreamed a girl she could see a girl that looked identical to her as if she was her sister her twin but in another Life. 

Always being the same girl but in different places but never where Jenna’ was, Never in the same town that she had grew up in. In the dream the girl never acknowledged her or even looked at her as if she was seeing another girls life as if it was her Life. But as the dreams would come they would go with her waking up in the chair that she would often find herself fallen asleep in. Often finding herself looking out of the window into the suns morning light. Thinking to herself 

“Why am I seeing this other girl? If I am me then who is she?”

Walking over to the window looking out into a sun filled day, looking at people as they would pass by. Some she knew, while others being new to the area. With Jenna standing there thinking about all of people and who could they be? who could they be? Someone else from somewhere else?

Thinking back on her time here, thinking back on her job, though she remembers working there. But she couldn’t remember when she first started there! It was like she had always been there! Just then realizing that she was late for work. Forgoing the morning shower slipping into her work clothes Jenna’ rushed out of her front door grabbing her bike on the way. knowing that speed was going to be her best friend this morning. 

Making her way through the streets the only way she knew weaving in out of the traffic occasionally hearing the honking of a car horn. throwing their hand up ether by saying a hello or to just watch where you are going. To Jenna’ that was her Life being on her bike loosing herself in the world around her. Racing as the wind blowing up against her making her way through the town. For today was going to be a good day not only at work seeing not only the Locals coming in giving a smile to people from all over. 

People who was either just passing through or in town for the it’s many mountain trails. Finding herself telling passerby’s of many of her own mountain adventures. For after her shift at the coffee house was over Jenna’ herself was then going to head back out to Angels Ravine for Angels Ravine was what Jenna’ would refer to it by. 

For it was to her of what Heaven would be like, for it was her own little piece of Heaven. But this time she was not only planning on just a day trip but on spending the night there. Surprisingly as her work day would go much faster than normal having only a few customers here and there. With excitement grabbing her bike leaving her work day behind her headed for the door she couldn’t wait for to her getting there was half the fun. 

Riding her bike out of town it was only a couple of miles down the road to where the trial leading up to Angels Ravine was. It was a warm afternoon as always Jenna’ enjoyed the ride hearing the sounds of nature all around her. With the occasional breeze that would make its way through the trees. normally she would be trying to best her own speed trying to best herself. 

But this time was different this day would be different, for a couple of days back a group of outsiders. A group that Jenna’ had not seen in the area before, a group of young cocky bike riders. Had challenged Jenna’ and Hector to a race, but not just any race but a race down the other side of Angels Ravine.

With Jenna’ and Hector arriving at the site first finding themselves setting there looking out over Angels Ravine. Setting there just enjoying the moment together talking about their time in the town together. The times that they had racing one another through the streets, coming up here to mountains. Setting there on Angel’s Ravine looking out over into the Ravine just ahead of them Jenna’ then turned to Hector asking him

“Do you ever think that you was someone else’s before”

With a puzzled look on Hector’s face he then replied back to her saying 

“Someone Else’s! No! What kind of question is that? Jenna’ are you feeling okay!”

With smiling to him just as she said 

“It’s just! I really don’t know! It’s like I’m or was someone else, I can’t really explain it.”

With Hector giving a laugh as he said to her

“I don’t know what I would do with two Jenna’s All I know is how I feel about the Jenna’ that is here now, setting here beside of me.”

With Jenna’ then giving him a smile just she then placed her head his shoulder saying to him

“I don’t know what I would do another me either! I can barely handle myself at times”

With Hector placing his arms around Jenna’ before telling her

“I Don’t think I could handle another you either! laughing, I just know that I am holding the one Jenna’ that I want to be with.”

Giving each other a smile as they set there looking out into what could be there future ahead. But just before they could get lost in the moment again, the other group had arrived.

They had arrived ready to show their dominance on the mountain, but with Jenna’ and Hector ready eager to show them other wise. The challenge was underway with Hector taking the lead first going down the steep incline, quickly followed by the outsiders, with Jenna’ trailing but was soon to catch up. 

The trail was daunting with very steep inclines, as they raced along the mountain trail. But just as Hector was out in front one of the outsiders came up from behind him. Running purposefully close to him knocking him off balance sending him crashing off the trail. 

With Jenna’ then stopping to check on him as Hector’ then motioned to her saying to her

“Go! Go get ‘em Jenna! You got this!”

And with that it wasn’t too long before Jenna’ had caught up to them, for Jenna’ knew the trails like no other. With Jenna now Racing hard and faster like she had ever raced before to the finish. Racing side by side with the outsider Just as Jenna’ then gave him a look and smile to him as she then pulled away. just the outsider went flying off of the trail leaving him setting there as Jenna’ had won the race. Later that evening Jenna’ and Hector’ would spend the evening together, talking to each other. Talking about what may be store in the future for them as Hector then slowly looked to Jenna’ just before giving her a kiss.

With Hector’ then saying goodbye to Jenna’ as he then headed back to town leaving Jenna’ there for the night. As Jenna found herself that night looking up into a starlit sky thinking back on her life. Thinking back on everyone that she had come to know wondering where her next path would take her in her life. Thinking about Hector on where the path would take them or if the path would lead them on their own separate paths. Thinking back on the talks that she had with Lawrence Fishburne also known as Voodoo, and the talks that she and Lou diamond Phillips had had. Simply known as Lou to her. With each of them helping her find and make her own path in life. 

As she came to the ravine Jenna’ then found herself setting down on the ledge looking out over the valley over across the mountains ahead. Thinking to herself that this was Heaven at least what Heaven would be like to her. After setting up her camp for the night setting down again looking out into the sunset as its light shined down onto the valley out into the town below. For many sunrise and sunsets Jenna’ had watched from there. 

But this one was different in a way that she could not describe with only a few words but just looking out into it. It was if time itself was coming to an end. Looking back down unto the town as the light of the sun shown down on it Jenna’ began to think to think back on her Life wondering to herself if she had a family out there somewhere. 

Wondering that if she did have a family what would her family be like? What was her childhood like? 

For as far back Jenna’’ could remember she had no family. For growing up all she could remember was that one morning she just woke up being in a place with the town and the people around her. But not as her family just people in her life a life that has seemingly went by all too fast. With the sun now slowly setting behind the mountains ahead of her.

Jenna’ would set there enjoying it as the last of its light would slowly disappear behind the mountains as the first star of the night would appear over head. Feeling a cool breeze starting to set in as Jenna’ lay there in her sleeping bag looking up into the starlit sky that was adorned above her. lying there just simply enjoying a nice quite night but as sleep would find her. 

The same dream the same dream that Jenna’ had so many times before. With the same girl the girl that Jenna’ would refer to her as her identical sister from what seemed to be from another Life. 

Living her life but not the same as her for everything around her was different, different in the way she had lived before! Before the town that she lived in now. But this time something happened that had never happened before. But a name was said that had never been said before in the dream and that was name of the girl in her dreams someone then called her Jenna’

Suddenly waking up to the morning’s light as it glimmered in and around all the trees sound her. putting her hands up to her head Jenna’ just set there stunned. Thinking to herself

“Who was this other Jenna’ And why do I keep seeing her?”

Feeling how real the dream was for her, unlike the others that dream actually seemed as if I was there! I was her! 

Still visibly shaken as Jenna’ just sat there looking around suddenly startled by a presence. 

With the presence being of a man standing there just outside of the tree line standing there looking at her. But Just before Jenna’ began to scream! As a calmness suddenly came over her a feeling of something telling her that everything was alright. Just as the man began to speak saying

 “Hello Jenna’ it is a pleasure to meet you so please do not be alarmed. For I am not here to harm you” 

With a feeling of relief coming over Jenna’ as Jenna’ then replied saying to the him

“Then why are you standing there looking at me? And how do you know my name?” 

“I know all about you Jenna’ I know your entire Life up until now. And I know the answer that you seek” 

With Jenna’ then replying 

“Answers to what? What answers do I seek” 

“ Dreams, Jenna’ your dreams.” 

As Jenna’ just set there still stunned now more curious then ever Jenna’ just suddenly shouted out the girl! Who was the girl in my dreams? 

The man then just smiled and simply said that 

“It is you Jenna’ and it is not you”

More confused then ever Jenna’ just replied by saying 

“Me! How” 

Just as the man then slowly approached Jenna’ standing there looking out into the valley below as he then said to her. 

“ In your Life you was you, and she was her in her Life.”

“But now in this Life you are her and she is not! and you are not. For her Life is her Life! For the Life that was once you is a Life that is no longer your Life” 

with Jenna’ then replying 

“Is this Heaven then and are you an Angel?” 

With a smile the man just simply said 

“ I am who I am! someone that is there, someone that knows. And no this is not Heaven! This is your Heaven Jenna’ And this is your Life the Life that you ask for” 

just as the man then slowly made his way back to the tree line. He then turned and said to Jenna’

 “The dreams shall now end, and your dreams shall begin.” 

“For do not look at what was then, just look at what is now! But look for what is to come!  for Life itself is the most precious thing that a person can have!”

“Now go and Live your Life Jenna’ for Life is what has been granted to you” 

Just then as the mysterious man then disappeared into the tree line never again to be seen by Jenna’ was now standing there looking out over Angels Ravine, Jenna’ couldn’t help but to feel a little different about her Life. 

As the then dreams of the girl was now slowly fading away from her forever. With only her dreams to come! Living a Life of whatever was to come for Jenna’

Looking down onto her town, the town seemed different to her it seemed different because now for it was her town her home. Her Life! With Jenna’ now leaving Angels Ravine, making her way back home, but as usual finding herself racing to beat her own best time.

Jenna’ was now making her way back into in Life, along with Hector by her side, riding through the streets on her bike weaving in and out of traffic. For the streets was hers and Life on her bike was now going to take her places that she had never gone before. For she was now riding into Life! into her 

Life, Living a Life of what she made it. For that day! Jenna Ortega’ had found Grace

1mkflaq,https://i.redd.it/3ruf3oevmohf1.jpeg,A talk about stuff,"It was a bright-ish cold morning as I walked through the still morning calm streets that overlooked the salty breeze docks, the cold waters reflecting the still rising sun and the descent of the moon which was accompanied by the light posts slowly dimming and then off.

A couple of workers and hired hands chipping away at small patches of ice that formed along the docks and ships, all of their breaths lightly visible from the slight coldness, yet somehow it was still calm before people even truly awake or sleep during the day, as I sat down and on a bench and gnawed on some generic breakfast bar and chug coffee awaiting for a someone. 

I looked out and was captivated by the eternal waters which flowed about, it captivated me and my tired mind as I sat there in a quiet moment which allowed my sleepy mind to flow about like the waters before me, reeled in and absorbed by the waters and its ever changing patterns and sight.

Fully distracted which caused my heart to skip a beat as the *Old Hound* Commander Galin and his hulking frame sat down on the bench, man I must have had my head fully submerged I thought, as he spoke.

“Morning Mr. Smithson.” His deep gravely voice spoke, as I was even more caught off guard when he gave a formality to me, as well saying my full last name. 

“Morning Commander Galin.” I responded, trying desperately to wake up as I sipped on my coffee, as Galin looked out to the waters, with an old satchel on his lap, and I definitely know it contains more papers for me to sort through and deal with.

“Thank you for meeting me on such short notice, I got a new report I need you to look at.” He seemed apologetic in a way, I just never seen this man like this before, I only saw him keep to himself and only talk to people who he needs to talk to, always to the point in whatever conversation he has.

With my mind still scrambling to be awake. “It’s okay, I’m used to it by now.” My brain was somewhat on autopilot, as Galin opened up his satchel and dug through it for a moment, it was stuffed with multiple papers and such, and soon pulled out a vanilla envelope and handed it to me.

“What’s the report about?” As I already began to open it.

“It’s something for the Codex.” He said as I pulled the somewhat loose pages out, only begging held by a paper clip that was taking a Hercules type task of holding all the papers together.

My eyes scanning the first page as I lightly muttered to myself, a couple of the notes from different scouts contradicted each other as I read.

“Scouts having difficulty telling if it’s someone or some animal?” 

“Yes, no one so far could truly tell if, and the higher ups are worried if it could be a sapient native.” He itched the brim of his scarred nose, and I could hear a small bit of worry in his voice.

“Why are they concerned?” I stupidly asked, I could have already guessed the answer when I scanned through the papers and the observed behaviors of this being, so far it’s a peaceful being at the very least who more so run and hide than fight.

“Well, in their own words *It could bring bad public relations*.” Sighing as he opened a flask and drank from it. “Enjoying what you read?”

“Yes, it’s fascinating and got me intrigued.” I absentmindedly responded, my mind was already fully engaged in the stories and accounts before me, most noting how it runs by swinging by using their long hooked fingers to swing around using any branches and canopy.

“Good, we need a better opinion on it besides any sponsors biased reviewers.” Putting the cap back onto his flask. 

It took me a moment to fully process that as I looked at rough sketches of this being and Galin could tell I was impressed by how it has a membrane between its limbs similar to a flying squirrel, which contributes to its swinging abilities and quick escapes. “So that’s why you came to me.”

“Yes, you were the only one the scouting department could consider trustworthy about this.” 

“What about Harkson?” I asked, he is another writer and documentor for the scouting branch, with Galin taking a moment to respond.

“Some of us think he’s in the pocket of some investor.” Bluntly said and I could see Harkson being in someone’s pocket to skew results, I nodded my head and continued to look at the rough sketches and pictures. 

“It dawns a curved mask that doesn’t rest flat on the face, the incident reports say when cornered it shot out a mucus which violently reacts to water.”

“Yes, the scout that experienced the mucus first hand was treated for first and some second hand burns.” 

“Are they making a good recovery?” 

“Yes, she’s a tough one who’s been through worse burns.” 

I remained quiet for a moment, most describing it having a blend of orange and yellow fur with whitish skin, others having more of an ashy orange fur, both having a white underbelly with small tints of blue. 

“I noticed something, both this specimen and the Stink-Wrath have long claws.”

“And weird fur.” Surprisingly to me, Galin somewhat joked in his response. 

“Heh yeah, I wonder what made the development such weird fur? Also what made them have long claws to escape?” 

Both of use sat there in a since for a moment, only the sound of the waves was left, both thinking about the question *What made them this way?*.

“So, what is your opinion?” Galin asked calmly.

I slightly sighed again, “My opinion so far is that it's an animal, some smart ones at that point.” I thought for a moment before I continued, “Make sure that scouts don’t try to corner it, it seems to be passive and we shouldn’t try to fight it.”

Galin cracked his neck and I handed the papers back to him, closing them into his satchel and standing up. 

“Thank you Smithson, I wish you luck when you are finally able to talk to Python about the education problem.”

“And I thank you back, Galin, so far it hasn’t been easy to talk to him.”

I stood up and cracked my back, having to crane my neck upwards to face Galin who shuffled through his trench coat’s pockets before pulling a card out and handing it to me.

“In the future if possible I want to get your opinion on any document that seems biased.”

I accepted the card and put it in my coat pocket, lightly nodding. “I can try my best, maybe my plate will be cleared when I finally talk to Python.” I somewhat joked.

“Have a good day Smithson, and may you have luck.”

And with a calm breeze that sweeps over the flowing ocean Galin walked away, and I looked back out to the flowing waters. At some point I would like to sail somewhere to just enjoy life, I don’t know where I will sail to if given the chance.

Looking at my watch and on time a small fishing ship sails into dock, making my way down to conduct another meeting about funding for the education rework. 

Just like the flowing waves, I flow from one meeting to another, always doing something, always unnoticed like the waves.

I know I can be so productive... I have been a productive person in the past and I remember there being a semblance of a routine in my life. I was a kid but I knew what I was doing at what time and sure I got distracted, and sometimes things had to be changed but that didn't bother me. I was thinking the routine could be on my phone or a paper I could post around my house, it would have like 8:00 am wake up. 8-9am coffee time, 9-9:30 eat breakfast, 9:30-10 dishes.... ect, ect.

1mkfkui,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditWritesSeinfeld/comments/1mkfkui/george_finds_an_insulting_note_in_the_conference/,George finds an insulting note in the conference room & thinks it's about him & tries to ID the culprits. Elaine's date cancels last minute with a cryptic message passed onto her by wait staff. Kramer tries to find a toilet that flushes counterclockwise. Jerry's GF flips a coin for all decisions,"After a long work meeting, George throws his lunch bag in the trash. He hears a thunk & realizes he left a candy bar in his bag, so he digs it out of the trash. Next to it is a note that appears to be 2 people smack talking about a 3rd. Comments include ""the doofus strikes again"" ""is he serious?"" ""Look at his 'hair'"" ""loser"". George assumes it must be about him and he is determined to figure out who wrote it and get revenge. 

Elaine meets a man in a bookstore. They hit it off and she invites him to the in-store coffee shop. He declines as he is in a rush but they exchange numbers. They coordinate a date later that evening. Elaine arrives at the restaurant. After time goes by, the waiter approaches with a message. 

""Monsieur Adam could not attend due to some unforeseen circumstances which he must handle posthaste"". 

""What happened? Is he alright?""

""One would hope so""

""What circumstances? Just tell me what he told you!""

*loses French accent* ""I dunno, lady on telling you exactly what he said on the phone""

""...can I get some more bread?""

Kramer learns about the Coriolis effect. He thinks it's a hoax and there's no way water just happens to drain a certain way because of the hemisphere. He and Newman make a bet whether its real. Kramer goes to toilet stores/hardware stores, various bathrooms...all the sinks and toilets flush clockwise. He thinks it can't be real and desperately tries to find one that goes rhe opposite way. 

At this point it's not even for the bet, it's for his own sanity. Kramer starts to see clockwise rotations everywhere - people tightening bolts, car wheels (""Kramer, just look at the cars driving to your left instead!""), etc. He special orders an Australian toilet system & calls an emergency plumber to install it secretly without the super finding out. (Side note: Jerry absolutely has a bit about how supers ""aren't all that super. He's basically a janitor. What's super about that? He can't fly. He can't control lightning. How does HE get thr title of SUPER?"")

Jerry casually asks his girlfriend which movie she wants to see. She isn't sure so they flip a coin. He slowly realizes she does that for almost all her decisions - even when she has a clear preference. ""You wanna ride the ferris wheel or get a snack first?"" ""I'm starving. Lets flip for it"". 

""Its like I'm dating Harvey Dent!""

Resolution: 

Elaines date is an on-call emergency specialty plumber. He had an emergency to deal with but didn't want Elaine to associate him with flooding fecal matter in a gas station restroom. He also ends up the one who installs Kramers toilet. Elaine runs into him, and he is flustered and tries to hide his job. He ends up installing it backwards and it spins clockwise. Kramer insists he's a part of the conspiracy.",10,1754609461.0,RedditWritesSeinfeld,2,1.0,False
1mkfkpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/howyoudoin/comments/1mkfkpg/ross_was_right_when_he_slept_with_chloe_while_him/,Ross was right when he slept with Chloe while him and Rachel were on a break,"I'm rewatching friends once again and just got to the bit in season 3 and it's midnight and though I should make a post about it because I have now chose my side after paying attention. God knows how I'm more aware of details on a show at midnight and not during the day.

1) Rachel asked for a break herself, saying ""maybe we should take a break"".""No a break from us""
2) Could Rachel not have insisted on Mark not coming over? I don't like being in arguments but if I me and my boyfriend were on a break and I suggested it and instantly regretted it NO WAY IN HELL would I let the guy who he was worried about most come over. If mark wasn't over high chances are they would've stayed together so much longer. 

Even she didn't like when Ross was going on a playdate with a stripper for Ben and because of chandler's comment she was worried more.

I'm watching it now, didn't in a way Chloe sexualy assault Ross with the amount of drink he would've had and she made the first move, before and after he drank? Also after she tried to kiss him again after being told Rachel's coming over. Also why would she tell Issac when she knew it was wrong?

3) Don't know if this means much but she did say several times that they broke up meaning doing things with others. Is. Not. Cheating.
4) When she hugged Ross in his apartment after she said ""Can I be your girlfriend again?"" Proving she knew Infront of Ross.
5) I do think she did run where it got rough because she was drowning in work and barely saw Ross. Personaly I don't think he shoud've came to her office because he heard how busy she was but she must've seen where he was coming from. 
(It's douchy for Ross to complain about doing 1 thing with Rachel when from how it sounds she comes to tonnes of his things)

He did say he was disgusted by what he did and was sorry dozens of times. It is 100% wrong but I do understand why Ross is right. Just after in the rest of the series she weaponised it and painted Ross as the bad guy.

I do see where she's coming from at the start, she just 'ended things' with the guy who loved her since year 9 and she finds out from the guy who serves her coffee that he has already slept with someone else. Although after thinking about it for a while she should've realised Ross was right that they were in a break and 'legaly' he's allowes (if relationships did have laws) I get her being mad for a few weeks but the rest of the series I think she kept bringing it up.

Ross being a jerk to Phoebe when she asked to pick him up is wrong. Also do get by Rachel didn't let Ross come I wouldn't want to invite him either. 
Rachel should've probably realised about the break when he came to drop of fuel.

(Side note I love the line when Carol says ""you slept with another women?!"" And Ross says ""you're one to talk"" 

Also from the description Joey gave when Ross was at his place it is weird for Ross to word it as ""forgiven me by now"" 

What do y'all think about Chandler and Joey telling Ross not telling Rachel? Would it have been different? She did say ""To hear about it from Gunther"" it's just how would he have told her. 

Very jerkish for Ross to stay at carol and Susan's anniversary he really should've left it now matter how sad he was. He also purposely left out the part of him sleeping with another women. Also annoying he came back in after they came back and stoled while it was obvious what they were doing 😏

Also Rachel was understanding when the guys made plans with Ross first but when Rachel made plans first Ross complains about it a little. He said ""For the first weekend I'm alone by myself""... He's not the only one. ""You all have to go?""... They all came to hang out with you when Rachel also asked and got tickets for something that she can't change the date on. 

You can tell I've done a lot of thinking about this, episode on and pausing to write stuff down. 😁😁

I found out 2 years ago I likely had familial hypercholesterolemia. I was able to get my LDL from 170 to 99 with a plant based diet. High fiber, only fat free dairy and fat free chicken and tuna 1x a week each. No eggs, red meat, butter or other animal products. No coconut etc.I know track sat fat daily to 10g or less a day and aim for 30g fiber. Filtered coffee.. very little if any added sugar. No alcohol or smoking. 

I had a baby at the end of 2024 and had very bad pre-eclampsia. During my pregnancy my diet was the opposite of ideal (thanks food aversions!) but since giving birth have been back to my former diet and get my ldl back down to 117(I think). 

I have tons of heart disease in my family(attack, stroke and quad bypass) and diabetes to boot, so when I went for my physical 7/21, I asked for my doc to test lipo b and a. I had not fasted so my trigs are noticeably elevated in my attached labs.

My lipo came back at 159 nmol/L. 
My doctor’s response was to take fish oils but I’m worried this is an under-reaction and don’t know how to proceed.

I want to know if I need to get on statins between now and my next pregnancy.

And

What should I say to my doctor?
Should I find a new one?
Self refer to a preventative cardiologist or lipidologist?

My diet is pretty darn locked in. Please help me figure out anything I can do to bring my numbers down more through diet (even if in addition to statins) and lifestyle.

Any other tests I should get done and how do I convince my doc it’s important?

Please see attached labs, thanks!!

1mkfhxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeenagersButBetter/comments/1mkfhxi/how_to_get_rich_starting_in_your_teens_self_made/,How to get “rich” starting in your teens (self made),"
Hey everyone. A lot of people think you can only get rich by either starting a company, inheriting it, or some other bullshit. I’m here to tell you that you can get “wealthy”, what I mean is about 1-3 million without taking any big risks. You can do this regardless of if you’re in college or out of college (have a job, in high school) however in college it will be more difficult due to student loans. If that sounds good stick with me here. Some of you may not like this but I’m trying to get you to retire comfortably and to be able to do what you want in life. 


# Step 1. Stop buying useless shit


Stop buying the designer clothes, shoes, or any other bullshit that you are going to grow out of in 3 years. Wear what you want but I wouldn’t recommend dropping 300+ on a single piece of clothing. Also, don’t get addicted to anything on coffee. The average adult spends about 2k a year on coffee, and if you don’t get addicted now don’t buy it. Also, I cannot stress this enough: **DO NOT GET INTO CREDIT CARD DEBT**. Buy what you can afford, and I think credit cards are great because it helps you build credit and it can earn you miles or points. However, CC debt grows so fast it will take you forever to pay off if you have it. 

# Step 2. Open a Custodial Roth IRA

What is a custodial Roth IRA? It’s a retirement account where you can invest your money, tax free. Get your parents to help you open one using whatever bank/brokerage they use. Use this to put whatever money you have into it (if you don’t have a job). I wouldn’t advise putting all your money into it, especially if you want an item, but when you don’t have any bills to pay it’s much easier to invest. Now, you can’t take any returns out of it until you are 59.5, but you can take any money out of it that you put in (ex, if I put in 20k when I’m 30, and I have a family emergency that costs 10k, I can take the 10k out of my Roth). A custodial account means your parents open your account and can put money into it, but when you turn 18 it’s your account. A Roth IRA grows tax free, which means you won’t have to pay capital gains taxes when you can deposit your gains. It’s by far the best way to grow your money, and I’ll tell you how, however the only downside is you can only put in 7k a year. If you are reading this as a teen im assuming you don’t have 7k, so this shouldn’t be a concern for now.

# Step 3. Invest in Index Funds

What are index funds? Index funds are funds that allow you to buy a small fraction of companies that are all in the same index (for example, VOO follows the S&P 500, QQQ follows the NasDaq 100). There are multiple types of index funds, and for that I’d reccomend r/ETFs for a full breakdown. My current portfolio is 70% VOO, 15% AVUV, and 15% VXUS.

Why index funds? Index funds have multiple advantages over choosing and picking stocks or mutual funds (where a broker chooses stocks for you). Here are some advantages to Index Funds:

- Low risk. Choosing and picking stocks is risky, and if the market crashes you’re only losing a fraction of what you would because you own so many different companies. 

- Low fees: Every time you buy or sell an index fund, your brokerage will fee you a certain percentage of the money you want to put in. An index fund will only charge you 0.06% (because it’s automatic and follows the index) vs Mutual funds, which could charge you up to 1.5% (doesn’t sound much but it could change it)

- Long Term Growth: The S&P 500 averages 8% growth year over year. This doesn’t mean it will consistently be 8%, some years it will be 25%, some years it will be -7% . **The key is time over timing.** The losses in the market will be offset if you stay in it for a long time. 

# Step 4. Stay consistent and wait. 

“Okay, cool, now I have invested in index funds, but 8% each year won’t make me richer.” This is the beauty of compound interest. What compound interest is (and in index funds growth compounds either automatically or daily), is basically your growth will be reinvested and will automatically buy more index fund shares for you. This means over time, and the more money you have, the money will grow. At first, you may not see growth, but it will grow. If you average out investing 300 dollars a month, for 40 years, you will have over 1 million dollars. this equates to about 3.6k a year, which when you are an adult will be totally doable if you budget in save. If you invest an average 500 dollars a month for 40 years with 8% returns, you will have around 2 million dollars. If you are making 70000 a year this is only about 9% of your income when you are an adult. If you go into a high paying job like a nurse or a lawyer, you will be able to max out and make a lot more than that. 

# Cool, but I can’t put 300 a month aside. What can I do now?

Well, if you are saying this, I’m assuming you don’t have a job yet, and that’s fine, however I would reccomend getting one if you can. If you don’t, look into things like reselling shoes, putting your birthday money aside, or anything like that. Any way to get money is key because starting now is a huge advantage and it will allow your account to grow even more. Any money and put it into your custodial. I’m begging you.

And there we go! That’s how to use index funds on an average career and retire a millionaire. I hope you enjoyed.

Also, inflation. 1 million 40 years ago was a lot more than it is now. I understand that. However, wages will rise, Roth IRA maximums will rise as well. There’s never an excuse to not retire comfortably.

1mkfhxh,https://i.redd.it/kirmlru7kohf1.png,THIS IS A FREAKING CIVIL WAR OVER CONAN AND SMORES!!,"i didn’t even wanna post again tbh. but after what i seen in the comments this week i have no choice. it’s civil freakin war in this fandom and i’m pickin a side. if you can’t see what this show is and what it *means*, you can leave. like seriously just go. click out. nobody’s gonna miss your negativity.

conan o’brien must be protected at all costs. and i *do* mean all costs. this is not just some joke i’m making, this is LIFE. the man has done more for this country than most presidents. he’s given us decades of comedy, kindness, and chaos and now that he wants to sit outside with his chums and enjoy a dang smore yall got a problem?? sad.

""he changed"" omg shut up. conan’s always been this. he’s always had that vibe. you just got older and cynical and boring and now ur blaming HIM for it?? no sir. not today. you’re not gonna drag the chill chums into your hollow little world of irony and apathy.

and then the adds. you people act like hershey's and ll bean are some kind of war crimes. like how DARE they show a branded cooler in the background. what do you think pays for the mics?? the folding chairs?? the freakin string lights?? this show costs money and if you don’t get that you must’ve never worked a day in ur life lol sorry but facts are facts.

and the way conan lets it roll off him. the calm. the grace. when carlson pushed that chocolate into his cheek and he just looked off into the distance like he was thinkin about the moon or mortality or just the sound of wind in the trees?? poetic. that wasn’t just funny. that was ART.

carson must be protected at all costs too. yes he talks slow. yes he looks like he just wandered in from a much cooler show. that’s the POINT. he brings balance. he’s the chill in chill chums. every time he says something i feel like i’m unlocking a new part of myself. he’s like the ghost of vibes past.

and sona. god. sona. this woman has been by conan’s side for YEARS. she went thru everything. she had twins. her house burned down. and she’s STILL funnier than 90% of people online. she deserves a throne made of chocolate and tote bags. i would personally carry her across a river if she asked.

matt gourley deserves more respect. he speaks softly and he carries a big marshmallow. the way he talks about cracker density with so much care like he's explaining weather to a child. give that man all the money. he wants to buy a haunted victorian umbrella stand with his ad revenue? LET HIM.

aaron bley is the secret sauce. the quiet king. the behind the scenes genius. if you don’t respect aaron bley then i don’t respect *you*. you think the audio just syncs itself?? the shots just line up magically?? no. aaron is in the back making sure the chill actually happens.

and dr. arroyo. yall really exposed yourselves when he showed up and half of you said “who’s that?” if you don’t know arroyo you don’t DESERVE arroyo. he’s like when a rare pokemon shows up. he’s not even trying to be chill. he just *is*.

also david hopping is literally hopping. he’s everywhere. fixing stuff. moving around like a caffeinated duck. and you act like he doesn’t matter?? he’s the air in the smore. he’s the tension in the graham. respect him or log off.

i watched episode 2 again last night and cried when sona said “wow” at the marshmallow. not because it was sad. but because it was real. she meant it. it was a full moment. and people just talk over that like it didn’t happen. do better.

if you think the show is “too slow now” then guess what. life is slow. conversations are slow. love is slow. not everything is cutscene montage youtube vlog tiktok rush rush scream talk. sometimes the best part is someone sipping water and sayin nothin for 15 seconds. 

the show is a *blessing*. like not even exaggerating. it’s soft. it’s human. it’s about connection. and now yall wanna ruin it cause there’s a backpack in the frame?? log off and go scream into a smoothie. this show ain’t for you.

i seen someone call it “cringe” and i laughed so hard i almost choked on a chocolate coin. buddy, you wish you could be this cringe. cringe is warmth. cringe is feeling things. cringe is admitting u care. if this is cringe then i’m the freakin king of cringe and i’ll wear the crown with pride.

the chocolate bar touching conan’s cheek is the new mona lisa. it deserves to be studied. it deserves a museum. you think you’re too smart for that moment? you’re not. you just don’t get it. some art is too quiet for loud people.

like seriously how did yall read my post and come away with “haha cringe” when it was literally a normal and very chill guy being honest. it’s like you don’t even WATCH the show. if you did maybe you’d understand the depth of what chill chums is about. its not just some funny friends sitting around with marshmallows (even tho they’re not even roasting them so all of you saying its fake because no fire guess what. IT’S THE VIBE). it’s about the connection and the layers. and the chocolate which is also a metaphor if you had 2 braincells rubbing together.

and SPEAKING OF CHOCOLATE. remember when carlson put that hersheys bar against conan’s cheek?? yeah. that was a whole entire moment. that wasn’t just a bit that was *symbolism*. that chocolate bar was like. everything. it was the weight of the haters. it was the pressure. it was all the whining and snark from the fake fans being shoved into conan’s face while he’s just trying to CHILL with his CHUMS. and his FACE. the way he looked??? like a man who’s been through it all and STILL shows up. still freaking shows up. just like he always does.

think about it. Maybe consider that Carlson, the most grounded, say-less-do-more presence in the whole group, was acting out what a lot of you are doing online, forcing something into someone’s face and then acting surprisedand shit. And Conan just sat there and took it

Anyway the point isthis whole outrage about the show “selling out” is weird and embarrassing. Nnow suddenly it’s “too corporate”? Okay Sure. Maybe the next step is for them to film it in a secret bunker where all the logos are blurred out and the smores are brow. That’s what you want right?

like this is the guy who survived NBC. this is the guy who made string dance a lifestyle. this is a man who invented a comedy language of his own. and now he's got carlson, who just shows up and says like 6 words a video and its always the best thing and he’s wearing a brown tshirt and jeans like some kind of chill prophet. and yall are like “who’s that guy” like shut UP. he belongs there more than you belong anywhere. carlson has earned the chair.

and conan’s not doing this alone by the way. hes got his fam. he’s got SONA. remember when her HOUSE BURNED DOWN??? and now you want to act all mad because she’s laughing in a lawn chair with a branded bottle of water and maybe mentioning a backpack like OH NO brand alert! stfu. maybe she deserves to smile while being paid to sit down and hang with her crew. maybe not everything is a corporate plot to take away your joy. maybe you just suck.

and matt?? matt freaking gourley?? you think he doesn’t need money for more antique clocks or whatever he’s always tweeting about? he deserves a room full of old maps and chairs shaped like birds and if chill chums lets him do that then so BE it. he’s not even trying to hide it. he’s like “this vest is actually comfortable” and you all act like he just stabbed you in the spine. you people are so dramatic.

these people—conan, sona, matt, aaron, carlson, arroyo, hopping—they’re not just “making content.” they’re creating a sanctuary. a holy zone. an energy bubble where nothing matters but vibes and sugar. and yall wanna pop it for what? clout? a snarky comment?

if i hear one more person call it a sellout i swear i’m gonna start throwing mini marshmallows at strangers on the bus. you think conan’s doing this for money? nah. he’s doing it for *meaning*. he’s doing it because he loves it. and it shows.

and like ok sorry but half the people complaining are probably just mad they didn’t think of chill chums first. it’s smart. it’s funny. it’s sunny. and it’s got carlson. who by the way is the future. you think he’s just some guy in a chair but guess what. he’s the mirror. he reflects you. he reflects us. he is the collective shrug of a nation. and he pressed chocolate into that moment and you LAUGHED at it. fools. freaking FOOLS.

# And look at the end of the day this is bigger then any one choclate bar or one lil moment on the camera. Its about where we put our energy at. Some folks wanna waste it freezing frames to see if a logo is in shot too long and other folks just wanna melt into the experiance like a warm couch you didn’t think would be comfy but it is. I aint saying one is right and the other is wrong (ok well I kinda am) I’m just saying maybe think about the big picture for once. Not the literal big picture on the set but like the feeling picture. The one thats in ur head but not a real picture if that makes sence.

There is also the thing nobody talks about and thats the time. Like how stuff changes. People change. Shows change. Heck even snacks change. U notice marshmellows aint exactly like they were when we was kids? Not worse just... diffrent. If we can accept that about the food why cant we accept it about the content. Some people are holding on to this “how it was” fantasy that maybe never even happend or was only in there head. And thats human sure. But dont let that make u miss the thing thats here now cause this is the only verison that is real.

I think too we forget the lil stuff matters. We remember the big laughs or a wild tangent but what about the pause. What about when somebody reaches for a cup and then dont even drink it. Thats texture man. Thats the flavor of life. You take that out and suddenly everythings too polished and fake. Sometimes the best part of a thing is the part u didn’t even notice till its gone. Thats why this matters even if we aint saying it right or even making a clear point lol.

And maybe just maybe this whole thing is about more then some vids on youtube. Maybe its a mirror for how people deal with change in general. Some folks go with it some fight it and some pretend they dont care but they are low key steaming. Its funny how the same exact clip can feel like comfort to one person and a problem to another. Thats not new thats just how people are. And I dont think theres a fix for that except maybe just letting people like stuff even if it aint the thing *you* wanted it to be.

End of the day what we got here is a shared moment. We all saw the same set up we all heard the same laughs and were all sittin here making our own idea of it. Some of those ideas line up and some dont and that is fine. Its normal. No matter if you like the ads or hate them you was still there. You still watched it. You still felt somethin even if it was annoyance. Maybe the point is just that. We was all part of it. Chum or not. And that is worth somethin even if we aint gonna agree on what it is.

Sona has earned every second of sittin in that chair laughin at marshmellows. She started out just being Conan’s assistant back in the day and now she is straight up part of the show. Thats not handed to just anybody. She put in years of work, running around gettin him coffee, putting up with his bits when probly she just wanted lunch, and now look at her. She’s got a mic in front of her and her name in the title. Conan saw what she could be before a lot of people did. He gave her that shot and she ran with it.

Matt too. People forget he wasnt always here. He came in, did his thing, and little by little he’s made himself part of the core group. He’s got that soft voice and that weird antique brain and it works. He didn’t just luck into this. He built it. From small guest spots to now being the guy who explains the science of a smore. You think anybody else could make cracker density funny? No. That’s why he’s here. He earned his spot the slow way and that’s the way it lasts.

Carlson is the perfect example of what happens when somebody just gets a chance. All he needed was one. One shot. Conan gave it to him. No big intro, no flash. Just here’s a chair, here’s a mic if you wanna talk, and that was enough. Carlson didn’t try to be somebody else, he just was himself. And now his presence is part of the DNA of the show. People talk about him like they’ve known him forever and that’s cause he fits that good.

And now you can see the same thing happenin with Dr Arroyo. He steps in, not all loud, just part of the mix. You can feel Conan’s got that same read on him he had on Sona and Carlson. He knows who can bring something to the table. It’s not about just being funny on cue, it’s about holding the space, letting the vibe breathe. Arroyo’s got that. Give him a few episodes and he’s gonna be just as much a piece of this as anybody else.

That’s the thing with this crew. They all started small. They weren’t famous movie stars dropped in to grab clicks. They were people Conan saw potential in and then trusted to grow into it. And they *did*. That’s why it works. That’s why it feels like something special got built here, piece by piece. It’s not fake. It’s not manufactured. It’s just the right people getting the right chance and actually making something out of it.

This is so much bigger than LL Bean and Hersheys. If you think it’s just about a jacket or a chocolate bar you’re missin the whole point, sweet summer child. This is about supporting something that’s real and that matters to the people making it. It’s about showing up for Conan and the gang, cause they’ve been showing up for us for YEARS. If you can’t see that then idk what to tell you, maybe go back to watchin whatever safe boring garbage you were watchin before.

The haters are out here chuggin straight up haterade like it’s happy hour. They wanna ruin a good thing cause they can’t stand seeing other people enjoy something. It’s pathetic. They see an ad read and they act like Conan spit in their cereal. News flash: people gotta get paid. This show doesn’t magically appear in your ears for free. It’s work, and work deserves pay. If that means Conan talks about a fleece or a s’more for a few minutes, so be it.

This isn’t just a podcast anymore, this is a movement. It’s people coming together around a vibe they can’t find anywhere else. You don’t just get a Sona and a Matt and a Carlson and a Dr Arroyo all in one place like that. It’s a community that’s been growing for years and now it’s strong enough to weather a few whiny crybabies crying about capitalism or whatever. Sorry, but this train’s already moving, and if you don’t like the snacks, get off.

And the funniest part? The people talking the loudest about “selling out” are the same ones who’ll be first in line when the merch drops. They’ll wear the hoodie and pretend they’ve been ride or die the whole time. I see you. We all see you. You’re just mad cause you’re not in on the joke right now. But you could be, if you pulled your head out of your own ass and just enjoyed it.

At the end of the day, the people who get it will keep getting it, and the haters will keep stewing in their little hater stew, sipping that haterade till the ice melts. Meanwhile we’ll be here, laughing at Carlson smashing a Hershey bar into Conan’s cheek like it’s the funniest thing in the world, cause it is. And if that bothers you, well, maybe you were never part of this to begin with.

every episode feels like a hug from someone who doesn’t need to say anything. just being there. just chilling. being chums. that’s what i want. that’s all i want.

if that makes me weird? cool. if that makes me sad? sure. but i’m happy being here. i’ll be over here with my little chocolate bar, my branded vest, and a smile on my face waiting for the next time carlson shrugs.

1mkfhqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalproductselling/comments/1mkfhqa/a_lot_of_people_say_they_want_to_sell_digital/,A lot of people say they want to sell digital products without showing their face. But very few actually follow through.I did and this is exactly how.,"Every time I make a post or share a breakdown of how I am selling digital products faceless, my inbox blows up. 

I’ve shown this to over 40 people who wanted to sell faceless.  
Some disappeared. Some overthink it  
Some made their first $5 online within days.

Here's what I tell them to start in 6 simple steps: 

Do not complicate it

**Step 1**: Pick one small topic you already know or one you see people struggling with.  
→ What do people casually ask you about without even thinking?  
→ Or what do you keep seeing people stuck on in Facebook groups, Reddit threads, or real life?

Examples:  
• You taught your cousin how to meal prep on a budget and they actually stuck to it.  
• You see tons of people confused about how to actually use ChatGPT to get stuff done.  
• You planned a 7-day trip to Turks & Caicos on a budget and spent under $3K including flights.

You don’t need to be an expert. If you solved it once, someone else will pay to skip the guesswork.

**Step 2:** Go on Canva (even the free version) and pick a template that fits what you want to share. You don’t need to design anything, or make it fancy. The layout is already done for you.  
Or if you like using Notion, google doc that works too. Just keep it clean and easy to follow.

You can create something simple like a checklist, a mini guide, or even a tracker.  
Keep it between 10 to 15 pages .. that’s more than enough.  
People don’t want long. They want helpful and easy to finish.

Step 3:Upload it to a platform where people can actually buy it.

You can use websites like Gumroad, Payhip, or Beacon.  
All three have free options, so you don’t need to spend money to get started.

Just follow the steps to upload your file, then add a short sentence or two explaining what it helps with.  
That’s it. Keep it simple and clear.

**Step 4:** Set the price.

For most simple products, $7 to $17 is the sweet spot.  
It’s affordable for buyers, and still worth your time.

People will pay to save time and skip trial and error.  
You’re not selling information. You’re selling clarity and speed. No fluff, no long course

**Step 5:** Since you’re doing this faceless, you’ll still need visuals  but you don’t need to show your face.  
Use free stock content from Pinterest, Pexels, or Canva, or take your own with your phone (like typing, walking, or grabbing coffee)

Keep it simple.

  
**Step 6:** Share your process on social media ..pick just 1 platform (IG or FB)

Talk about why you made it and what it actually helped with.

People don’t care about how fancy it looks (Trust me, mines are simple google doc)  
They care about whether it works and whether it sounds like something they could use too.

That’s really all it takes. It works if you keep it simple and stick with it.

If you’re serious about making faceless marketing work, I put everything into one guide that shows you exactly how to do it  from growing your page to turning followers on IG into income without showing your face.

It’s called *The Ultimate Faceless Marketing Handbook.*  
Not free, but it’s literally less than a cup of coffee.

1mkfgtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mkfgtn/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_go_out_with_my_cousin/,AITAH for not wanting to go out with my cousin until she stops bringing her wife?,"I'm 29f, and I have a 32f cousin, who I love spending time with. She's truly someone I can spend hours talking about any topic. The problem is that whenever she has a partner, she becomes a Siamese twin with them. She can't go anywhere without her partner and doesn't take hints when I don't want her to bring her.
She's currently been married to her wife for two years, and don't get me wrong, I like her wife and I can spend time with her. But I've noticed this person has the thought that everyone in my family adores her and is dying to spend time with her, when in reality, we're a very warm family and never turn anyone away unless there's a compelling reason to do so.
 The point is, in the last few get-togethers with my cousin, her wife is obviously there, and sometimes I want to touch on somewhat intimate topics. Besides the fact that I don't like everyone knowing about my life, this girl can't just listen and shut up; she always has to give a super out-of-place opinion about other people's lives. When she speaks, she doesn't care if anyone was talking; she expects everyone to shut up so we can hear her (nonexistent) wisdom. And we can't joke about family matters because she immediately starts judging our family with the excuse that she's already been to therapy and knows what she's talking about. By the way, the family my cousin and I share is obviously not a perfect one, and there are some pretty toxic members from whom we stay away. And in this girl's family, there are some very shady and damaging things going on, and she continues to maintain a close relationship with her family without any problems. Which is none of my business or affect me, but I find it hypocritical that she feels she has the moral authority to talk shit about our family when hers is worse.  Plus, I was raised never to speak ill of your partner's family, especially not in front of them, out of respect.
On top of that, she's one of those people who uses her diagnosis to excuse everything. For example, when my cousin and I are talking, she interrupts to show her a random TikTok and excuses herself by saying, ""I have ADHD and I can't take turns,"" which, aside from being stupid, is offensive because she isn't even diagnosed. She self-diagnosed herself with TikTok.
The other day, I was going through a period of depression (I have DIAGNOSED dysthymia). I called my cousin to invite her over to my house to talk. I asked her to please be alone because I had some intimate things I wanted to tell her. She told me to give her time to get organized and she'd let me know when she could.
The next day, she called me and told me we could go for a coffee at 8 p.m.
 I told her I really didn't feel up to going out, and that it seemed too late since most coffee shops close between 9:30 and 10 p.m.
I asked her if he couldn't stop by my house after work (she leaves at 2 p.m.), and she said no because she wanted to spend time with his wife.
Honestly, I felt very disappointed.
It's not that I want to be above his wife; it's just that they actually spend all their time together. When his wife's work schedule allows, she even accompanies my cousin to work for all her shift. And the fact that she couldn't spare me an afternoon of her time when I was really having a hard time made me very sad.
Besides, we've both had a history of su!c!d3 attempts, and we made a promise to each other that we would always be there for each other during those difficult times because we understand what it's like to be there and feel like you have no one.
 And believe me, I know what it's like to be married. I've been married for 7 years, and from the beginning, we were very clear that each of us needed time apart with our friends or family, and also time for ourselves.
I ultimately ended up declining the offer. I'm feeling better now, but I still feel like she didn't keep her promise. This makes me tolerate her wife less and less, and I don't want to see my cousin at all.
Am I wrong?
Ps. sorry if it's difficult to understand, english is not my first language. ",1,1754609161.0,AITAH,0,0.6,False

By 7:45 there was already a line of about 10 people in it. The main thing I wanted to get were their croissants since I've been reading about how theirs were excellent, and for me our city just doesn't have a lot of options for *good* croissants. The ones off the top that I think fit that bill are J'aime and Delice et Chocolat, and the latter isn't in the city. I didn't enjoy the croissant (way overbaked and too crumbly/flaky) from Machine Shop, but since the list is so so small, I'd include them. 

I was able to get both regular croissants and pain au chocolats. I would say they are good, but nothing that edges out offerings from J'aime or Delice. I thought they were ever so slightly over baked, giving them a slight burnt taste. Both croissants were sizable, and just one would make a perfect morning pastry with a coffee. I would still say Delice makes the best croissants in the Philly area. 

I wanted to get something else but it was sold out by the time it was my turn. I did get a chocolate chip scone which I have not tried yet. They are clearly a great bakery and I'm happy for their success.",13,1754608840.0,PhiladelphiaEats,16,1.0,False
1mkfbw2,https://i.redd.it/kkkbkkctkohf1.png,Viral Receipt Shows a Breakfast for 5 in Las Vegas Cost $165.81,"A viral receipt is going around Vegas, sparking frustration among locals after showing a $165.81 breakfast bill for five people.



The receipt includes items like $27.50 French Toast Ambrosia, $24.50 Eggs Benedict, a $27.50 Pancake Combo, a $24.00 Philly Cheese Steak, and four coffees at $6.25 each, ordered during a visit to the iconic Peppermill.



For many, this is just the latest example of how out of control prices have become in Las Vegas. Now, even a casual breakfast has become a symbol of that growing frustration. The $6.25 coffee, in particular, struck a nerve, with some pointing out it costs more than an entire fast food meal.



But beyond the food prices, the tip suggestions printed at the bottom of the receipt were based on the post-tax total, not the pre-tax subtotal. That means a 20% tip was calculated as $33.16 instead of the $30.60 it would have been before taxes.

* Don’t attract attention.
* Don’t use magic in front of humans (see rule #1).
* And above all else, avoid letters sealed with black wax—especially those bearing the thorny crest of Blackthorn Keep.

She’d been doing fine. Great, actually.

Until today.

Mo took a slow breath, inhaling the mingled scents of aged paper, freshly ground beans, and the hint of cinnamon from today’s special. This cozy bookstore café was her sanctuary, where Edison bulbs cast honey-gold light over worn armchairs and shelves bent under the weight of a thousand worlds. Here, the only magic came from stories, not bloodlines.

She ran her fingers across a worn counter, her gaze drifting over the familiar spines that lined every wall. She chose this place after a long deliberation and intense search, tucked away from the world. A place where she was just Mo—the friendly barista who gave great book recommendations and knew how to craft the perfect latte art.

Returning from her reverie, Mo froze. The cup of latte she’d been preparing hovered a centimeter above the counter, spinning lazily counter-clockwise, foam swirling into intricate patterns no barista course had taught her. The cinnamon sprinkles arranged themselves into what looked suspiciously like ancient runes.

“Damn it,” she hissed, fingers clenching as she forced the cup down with a soft clink. “Get it together, Mo.”

Clinking softly, the cup dropped back on the saucer and stopped shifting. It was a tiny piece of magic, but even that wasn’t wise in a life she wanted to keep as ordinary as possible. Of course, books fluttering closed on their own or dishes floating for a second. Those tricks were easy to dismiss as imagination or coincidence.

Mo knew she shouldn’t do that. She craved normalcy. But these little sparks of power were the only nod to a past she kept buried.

Late-afternoon sunlight streamed through dusty windows, illuminating dust motes that danced in the warm air. Mo restocked the shelves with the latest arrivals, brushing her fingertips across the colorful spines. A young girl tugged at her sleeve, eyes wide with excitement.

“Excuse me, do you have any books about dragons?”

“Absolutely,” Mo replied, guiding the girl to a shelf packed with fantasy novels. “You’ll find plenty of adventures here. If you want to test them first, you can sit in those cozy armchairs over there.”

Soon, the girl’s laughter rang like a bell as she flipped through the pages, enthralled by fire-breathing beasts and brave heroes. Mo couldn’t help but smile, seeing a child who had never experienced an encounter with a real dragon. In moments like this, she felt at peace—no mention of her odd last name or reminders of the inheritance that loomed in the background.

A gray-haired guy with a kind smile was waiting when she returned to the counter. Mo frothed the milk and poured it into a cup, shaping a perfect leaf on the surface. The man reached for his latte and gave her an appreciative nod.

“Oh, it’s just perfect,” the man said. “It’s like it was 3D-printed! Or...” he paused dramatically. “Made with magic!”

“Ha-ha! Just my trained hands here,” answered Mo with a smile, showing her open palms.

The ease of these interactions. Absence of manipulative tactics. Ordinary chatter, friendly faces, no family secrets. Mo loved all of that.

Soon after the man left, the brass bell above the door fell silent mid-chime. A sudden chill slithered across the floorboards, turning the cozy warmth brittle. Mo’s spine went rigid before she even turned. The espresso machine sputtered and died. Every light dimmed as if something were drinking the electricity.

Perched on the window sill was a raven, its feathers so black they seemed to swallow the afternoon sunlight. Its eyes—too knowing, too ancient—fixed on Mo with unmistakable recognition. The dishcloth slipped from her fingers as memories she’d spent years burying clawed their way to the surface.

The raven hopped onto a table, silent and still, a cold presence in a place meant for warmth and laughter. A place that Mo chose explicitly for its mundanity. Mo willed it to leave, but instead, the raven tilted his head and dropped a letter onto the tabletop. The envelope didn’t have a name or a return address on it. Instead, it was sealed with black wax.

Mo’s stomach churned.

She recognized the crest pressed into that seal: a twisted, thorny emblem from a place she made so many efforts to forget. Taking a tremulous breath, Mo approached, snatching the letter before any of her customers noticed. Even if it was hard to hope that no one wouldn’t be surprised by a large black bird sitting on the table indoors.

“Please go,” she whispered, heart hammering in her chest. “You are starting to attract attention.”

The raven only cocked his head, black eyes reflecting the warm golden light of the café. Then he spoke in a rasping croak that sent a tremor up her spine: “Alright, alright. I’m out of here—happy now?”

Before Mo could reply, the bird fluttered his wings and vanished through the open door. She stared after him, the echo of that ragged voice lodging in her mind.

Pressing the letter against her apron, Mo fought the urge to tear it up on the spot. But she knew better than to destroy the message. Surprisingly, no one else in the café seemed to notice anything unusual. It was as if the door had never opened, and the raven had never let itself inside.

Mo went back to the counter. Nothing changed in the space around her. But now, she could see all the books that had been returned to the wrong places by the customers. All the cracks of the ancient counter. All the spots on the tables that she could never fully clean up.

With forced composure, Mo slipped the envelope into a drawer beneath the register. She wasn’t going to open it. Not yet. Not ever, if she could help it. But her heart refused to slow, and a faint hum of dread settled over her day.

Mo locked up the café that evening. Flipping the sign on the door to *Closed*, she prepared herself for the last chores of the late shift. She still had to prepare the place for the morning.

The hush that fell over the store was usually her favorite part of the day, a time when the only sounds were the soft settling of books and the faint whir of cooling coffee machines. Tonight, though, the silence pressed on her like a weight. She glanced toward the drawer where the letter lay hidden. It felt like the letter pulsed with power she couldn’t ignore.

Shaking off her nerves, Mo finished wiping down the tables. A flicker at the window snagged her attention. She turned, heart stuttering. Outside, a raven perched on the streetlamp, illuminated by the dim glow. He stared straight into the bookstore, straight at her.

Her throat tightened. “Not tonight,” she muttered. “Please, not tonight.”

But the raven didn’t leave until she shut off the lights. And even then, he lingered for a few minutes as if making sure that he wasn’t getting an answer any time soon.

By the next afternoon, Mo had almost convinced herself it was all a bad dream. She greeted regulars with a cheery smile and recommended titles to curious newcomers. But tension coiled beneath her friendly demeanor.

“Hey, Mo,” a voice called from across the room, breaking the spell of her little moment. It was Mrs. Harlow, a regular who always came in for her afternoon tea and a chat. “I never paid attention to your last name. But, you know, I’ve been reading the schedule of the restroom cleaning shifts… hm… in the restroom. And saw it near your name. Nightshade? That’s a peculiar last name, isn’t it?”

Mo forced a laugh.

“My parents are goths—super into spooky stuff,” she said. “You haven’t yet heard my full first name. It’s all, uh, part of the family brand.”

Mrs. Harlow chuckled, picked up a book, and returned to her table, seemingly satisfied. Mo exhaled, grateful the conversation hadn’t gone further. Sharing too much of her family’s history was never a safe thing.

She returned to organizing the shelves, smoothing out the covers. Then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw him again: the raven.

He was perched on a ledge just outside the window. At least the raven wasn’t trying to sneak in anymore. But something had to be done about it. And done soon.

Mo tried to focus on the café chatter, the hiss of the espresso machine, anything to distract herself. But every glance at the window revealed the same glossy black wings and those eerie, unblinking eyes.

Refusing to give in to panic, Mo summoned a tiny flicker of magic to steady the pile of books in her arms. They floated gently from her hands onto the shelf. She never allowed herself to do this, afraid of rumors and misunderstandings. Still, it centered her and gave her a small opportunity to do something that was second nature to her.

The sensation was so good that Mo almost took solace in its neatness. Both the magical action and the result. Until the raven fluttered his wings in what looked like a mocking response.

He saw.

Another shift ended, and Mo found herself alone. The lights dimmed, and the doors locked. She pulled open the drawer beneath the counter. The letter, sealed with black wax, looked at her ominously. Of course, it didn’t literally *look* at Mo. But she felt its pointed attention.

After a moment’s hesitation, Mo set it on the countertop, staring at the elaborate crest pressed into the seal.

*Blackthorn Keep.*

It was a name that brought a storm of memories—her parents, old halls echoing with spells, the claustrophobic weight of a legacy she never asked for. The darkness.

Her throat constricted. And when she took it in her hands, the letter felt heavier than paper should be.

“Just burn it,” she whispered to herself. “No more nightmares, no more ravens.”

Yet her feet didn’t move. She didn’t go to pick up a pan or a pot in which she could safely destroy this envelope. She wrestled with indecision, the hush of the store closing in around her. Finally, Mo snatched the letter and headed into the kitchen. But as soon as she struck a match, the door at the back of the café flew open, hitting the wall with a dull thud.

Mo spun around to find the raven standing in the doorway—looming even larger than before, his feathers so black that it felt like they had absorbed the dim light. One moment, he stood there; the next, he beat his wings and vanished, leaving only a swirl of cold air and the feeling that something ancient was watching.

The letter slipped from Mo’s fingers, landing on the floor before she could put it to flames. She gasped, heart thudding, and picked it up again. Magic tingled at her fingertips, an unwanted reminder of her true identity.

This time, she took the letter home. The whole night, it lay on her small kitchen table, and Mo almost sensed whispers crawling into her dreams. She wasn’t even sure if it were really dreams or something else. But when the first light of the new day crept from behind the curtain, Mo felt like she hadn’t slept even a minute.

 

\*\*\*

 

Early the next morning, Mo stood—her hands on her hips—in the entrance hall of her apartment. From this spot, she could see the letter still waiting for her on the kitchen table. She hoped it wouldn’t be there. A girl could dream, right? But, of course, it didn’t move even a millimeter.

“A quick peek,” she muttered. “Then I’ll decide.”

She took a few decisive steps, approached the table, and broke the seal with one quick motion. The letter’s script was ornate, almost archaic. Proper. At the top, it bore the crest of the High Council, along with an urgent summons:

*By order of the High Council, Morgana Nightshade is summoned to Blackthorn Keep. Your parents have gone missing. As the statutory waiting time has elapsed, your inheritance has to be claimed. Your presence is required immediately.*

Mo’s blood turned to ice. *Missing?* That couldn’t be right. They might have been distant and wrapped up in their own affairs. They left all the time for their weird projects and escapades. But her parents never just vanished.

Anger welled in her—was this some twisted ploy to lure her back?

However… Her father, who’d grown increasingly paranoid in those last months before she left. What if their disappearance wasn’t voluntary? She left the Keep on purpose. But she still cared about the connection she had to her parents. Especially her mother.

Slamming the letter on the table, she paced the tiny apartment. Mo wanted her quiet life, her bookstore café, her beloved, mundane routine. She wasn’t the wandering heir to a dangerous legacy; she was just Mo, the barista who recommended great reads.

Yet the words on the page refused to fade. She thought of that unnatural raven. Of course, she knew him. She had known him well since her earliest childhood. Mo recognized him at first sight.

And the creeping shadows in her apartment, and the faint hum of magic in her veins that had felt so alive since the letter arrived. In the pit of her stomach, she knew that ignoring the summons wouldn’t make them go away.

A soft ping from the bell at the register drew her attention. Mrs. Chen stood there, holding a worn paperback.

“This one again?” Mo smiled, recognizing the third book in a fantasy series about a reluctant chosen one. “I thought you finished it last week.”

“My granddaughter loved it so much, I’m getting her her own copy.” Mrs. Chen’s eyes crinkled. “She’s just like the hero—says she doesn’t want to be special, but...” She shrugged knowingly.

Mo’s smile faltered. The words struck something buried deep, a memory of her mother’s voice: “Sometimes, Mo, we run from what we’re meant to be. But destiny... it has a way of finding us. The trick is to choose your path before it chooses for you.”

She shook off the memory, wrapping the book with practiced efficiency. But the echo lingered, like the scent of midnight roses her mother used to grow in their conservatory—beautiful, deadly, and impossible to ignore.

Despite everything that was happening in her life, despite the ominous news about her parents, Mo went through the motions—serving customers at the café, chatting about novels, and restocking shelves. But she caught herself flinching at every slight movement of shadow. More than once, she saw a flicker of black outside the windows. Whether it was the same raven or her rattled imagination, she couldn’t say.

Mr. Thompson, another regular, known for his mystery-novel obsessions, noticed her mood. “You all right, Mo? You seem a bit on edge today. Do you need any help?”

Mo mustered a tight smile. “Just didn’t sleep well, Mr. T. Everything’s fine.”

He nodded sympathetically. “Well, take care of yourself, kiddo. Sleep is important. When you don’t sleep, you start to see all sorts of strange things!”

Eh… What did *he* know about strange things? And it wasn’t like Mo didn’t try to sleep. But the pull of the letter buzzed at the back of her mind like a persistent wasp. Each hour that passed felt heavier, as if time itself was thickening around her. She could almost feel the whole weight of Blackthorn Keep pressing on her, calling her name with a voice that echoed through centuries of her family’s lineage.

That evening, she stood alone in her apartment, watching shadows gather in the corners. Mo couldn’t force herself to step into the kitchen and hadn’t even grabbed anything to eat yet. The letter lay on her kitchen table. Of course, where would it go from there?

A small, half-packed suitcase sat by the door—a grudging admission that she might have to leave.

Slowly, she stretched her hand and turned on the light. It was as if the decision would have been easier if it hadn’t been made in darkness.

Darkness. That was it. That was what the decision was about.

Mo turned the letter over and over in her hands. Memories of the Keep overwhelmed her: the echo of ancient halls, cryptic incantations scrawled on stone walls, her parents’ aloof silhouettes gliding through corridors. Insane parties and affairs. Control and manipulation. She’d left that world because it had felt oppressive, stifling.

Yet now, it reached for her again.

Mo clenched her jaw. She struck a match and brought it to the letter. The paper didn’t burn—it dissolved, black wax melting upward against gravity, the letter crumbling into motes that hung suspended in the air. In their place, silence spread like spilled ink, so complete Mo could hear her own heartbeat echoing off the walls. For three breaths, she dared to hope.

Then came the humming—a sound that vibrated in her molars before reaching her ears, like thunder trapped inside her skull. The potted fern by the window withered. Her phone died with a plaintive beep. The shadows peeled themselves from every corner, slithering across the ceiling and walls to converge in her living room—not darkness, but absence, a hungry void that bent the light around it.

A portal. The air crackled with ozone and possibility, that unmistakable metallic tang of raw magic that brought back memories of sneaking into her father’s study, of whispered incantations under moonless skies.

“Of course,” thought Mo. “They know me too well. They knew how to trigger it.”

Mo’s breath came in rapid gulps as she crept toward the roiling darkness. The half-packed suitcase sat next to her feet; she grabbed it on instinct. There was no point in taking much—what use were clothes and toiletries in a place where spells reigned?

“This is a terrible idea,” she whispered. The swirling portal seemed to pulse in agreement, a silent heartbeat in the gloom.

Mo squeezed the handle of her suitcase. She heard a distant croak in the stillness—like the raven was mocking her from without. Her throat tightened, and for an instant, she considered running. But where would she go? The Keep wouldn’t let her slip away, not if it had truly begun to seek for Mo…rgana. If it had started to attune itself to her.

Mo stood at the edge of normalcy, her carefully constructed life behind her, the shadows of her birthright ahead. The half-packed suitcase held pitifully little—a worn paperback, her favorite coffee mug, the ordinary talismans of a life she’d chosen. None of it belonged to where she was going.

“Just one look,” she promised herself. “Just to make sure they’re really gone.”

Summoning every ounce of nerve she had left, Mo extended her hand. The portal’s surface felt cool and fluid, neither liquid nor gas, but something ancient that predated such distinctions. It swallowed her fingers, recognizing her blood, her magic—the heritage she couldn’t escape. The darkness tugged at her with the familiarity of family, urging her to surrender.

She clutched the suitcase until her knuckles ached.

“Damn it,” she muttered, closing her eyes. “Damn it all.”

Heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird, she stepped through.

The apartment vanished in a rush of disorienting cold. In its place came suffocating shadows and the faint echo of distant bells tolling. Mo was caught between worlds for one breathless instant, her body weightless, her mind spinning. A single thought thundered through her:

*I was right—this is a terrible idea.*

1mkf974,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1mkf974/here_is_how_i_fixed_my_terrible_sleep_why_sleep/,"Here is how I fixed my terrible sleep. Why sleep is non-negotiatable: Sleep detoxifies your brain. Without it everything else (diet, workouts, supplements) won't work for extending lifespan and longevity.","I used to treat sleep like it was optional, like it was something I could just “catch up on” later. I’d push through nights with only four or five hours, thinking coffee would fix the problem. But over time, I felt my body and mind slowly breaking down. I was more irritable, my workouts felt harder, my memory was slipping, and no matter how much I ate healthy or took supplements, I wasn’t improving. That’s when I learned the truth: without good sleep, nothing else you do for your health will work.

The science is brutal but clear. Sleep isn’t just “rest” — it’s when your brain literally cleans itself, removing toxins and waste that build up during the day. It’s when your DNA repairs, your hormones balance, your immune system recharges, and your muscles actually grow from the training you did. Skip it, and you speed up aging. Studies show poor sleep shortens your lifespan, damages your DNA, shrinks your brain, and raises your risk for heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, even cancer.

And here’s the part that hit me the hardest — no amount of healthy eating, supplements, or biohacking can replace what sleep does. You can be on the best diet, taking every longevity pill known to man, but if you’re skimping on deep, consistent sleep, your body can’t recover, your brain can’t detox, and your cells age faster. Sleep is the foundation, the starting point. Without it, everything else crumbles.

So I made it non-negotiable. I started going to bed at the same time every night, even on weekends. I get sunlight in my eyes within 30 minutes of waking to set my circadian rhythm. I stopped scrolling on my phone in bed. I made my room cool, dark, and quiet. I stopped caffeine after lunch and avoided alcohol before bed. And I began winding down with reading, meditation, or stretching instead of screens.

The difference? Night and day — literally. My focus shot up. My workouts became more powerful. My mood leveled out. I woke up actually feeling rested, which I hadn’t felt in years. My skin improved, my energy lasted all day, and I could think sharper and clearer.

Experts like Dr. Matthew Walker say, “The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.” And I get it now. Sleep isn’t wasted time — it’s when you’re literally protecting your future self. It’s your body’s free, built-in anti-aging therapy, and it’s more powerful than any drug or supplement we have.

If you want to live longer, think better, and stay strong into old age, start here: guard your sleep like it’s your most valuable asset — because it is. Give your body the full, deep rest it was designed for, and you’ll be amazed at how every other part of your health and longevity plan finally clicks into place.

I learned this the hard way, but now I’ll never go back. Sleep is my number one longevity habit. Not my diet, not my workouts, not my supplements — sleep comes first, because without it, none of the rest even matters.",61,1754608606.0,immortalists,5,0.99,False

I’m going to college in the fall and I’ve been looking for vintage plates for a while and a few weeks ago I was at an antique store and I saw tons of Corelle plates for sale and I loved them but I couldn’t justify the vendors asking $10 per plate! So I thought I would hold off and see what I could find while thrifting and lo and behold…. The thrift gods have certainly blessed me. I found this whole set of Woodland Brown tableware for $20!!! I’m absolutely in love with it all and upon further inspection I was pleasantly surprised to find 4 Crazy Daisy plates and 2 cereal bowls mixed in! Which is my favourite Corelle pattern (event though I’m happy I found a Woodland Brown set because it’s a lot more neutral and fits the rest of my things). I did quite a bit of research of these things especially the mugs. So turns out the mugs are actually PYREX. since Corelle and PYREX are both owned by Corningware, when Corelle came out with Woodland Brown plates, bowls, and teacups, they introduced “transition pieces” under PYREX which still fit into Woodland Brown sets. Which in my case, is these AWESOME coffee mugs!!

In case anyone was wondering, from my research I’ve determined that my entire set is worth around $400 to the right person

I'm not exaggerating! Though, I HAVE had a LOT of espresso just now so I'm very twitchy & very enthused about life & the universe in general.

1mkf38s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mkf38s,Keep or Scrap August 2025. Explanation below,"This is an update to the one I posted way back in February, using updated card images and reordering the lists to the current meta that we're in. I'll go over some of the biggest changes;

# Template
- **TIERS ARE UNORDERED**
- **Craft** is a tier I'm bringing back, since it's now a lot more clear which cards are worth putting sparks towards
- **Keep** is now two tiers; **Use** and **Keep**. Use means that a card is immediately helpful for budget decks while also being valuable to keep for later. Keep meanwhile means a card is worth keeping for decks that you'll make later once you own enough higher rarity cards
- If you want the tier list templates, [you can find it here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/PvZHeroes/comments/1lrx6l6/i_made_updated_tier_lists_for_every_class/)

# Guardian
- **Pecanolith** is now Scrap. It's usually been Keepable since Guardian always wanted it for a finisher, but Gravitree is just better top-end that ends up being more lethal without backfiring in the same ways as it. It was still Keepable in February as tech for Quarterly, but now it's just not worth taking
- **Hot Date** is Keep tier. It was put into Keepable before since it wasn't useful on a budget, but Keep tier is now a lot more descriptive of the card's limits
- **Body-Gourd** and **Soul Patch** are Keepable now. They both got buffs that made the a lot more runnable. Soul Patch is still just a weaker Poppies, but that's not saying it's bad
- **Pear Cub** and **Red Stinger** are Use. Again, they got some significant buffs that have made them much more ideal to use

# Kabloom
- A lot of cards are Scrap now; specifically **Banana Launcher**, **Reincarnation**, **Pineclone**, and **Gloom-Shroom**. Gloom and Pineclone were already bad cards that stopped being useful as budget options due to power-creep. Blauncher and Rein meanwhile are just too niche to keep on a budget. You typically either want better aggro options or more sparks to put towards Fig
- **Astro-Shroom** is just Keepable now. It's still a fine budget option and you still want it for Cycle Cap, but Nightcap at max is a lot more flexible and other heroes just don't bother with this card

# Mega-Grow
- Most obviously, **Espresso Fiesta** is craft now. The card is genuinely broken on some heroes, and it's generally really good now
- **Lily of the Valley** and **Apotatosaurus** are now Keep and Use respectively. Apotato is good top-end that can help finish games, while Lily is more consistently good in decks 10k sparks and up after its buff
- **Black-Eyed Pea** is Scrap now. Card is genuinely not good anymore ever since Cabbage got its buff. Pea Patch also takes its spot in decks, and Umbrella being more playable means BEP isn't necessary for trick tech
- **Spinach** is Keepable now, since a lot of Leafy cards got buffs. It's like a more versatile Onion Rings with weaker effects

# Smarty
- Many of the Amphibious cards are Keepable or Scrap now, including **Laser Cattail**, **Bog of Enlightenment**, and **Spyris**. They're used far more rarely at maximum and Smarty in general is very rarely played aggressively
- **Sportacus** was moved down and **Dark Matter Dragonfruit** was moved up for similar reasons, as Smarty has more of a focus on midrange and control than before
- **Winter Melon** also got moved to Keepable for those reasons

# Solar
- **Sun-Shroom** is craft. I feel like this doesn't need an explanation; card's busted
- **Aloesaurus** and **Wing-Nut** are Scrap. Similar to Pecan, they were really only recommended for the meta at that time. Aloe made up for the lack of lethality Solar had, while Wing-Nut was a simple answer to Quarterly. Both cards are completely unnecessary to keep now, however
- **Cross-Pollination** is Keepable now. It's a decent sustain option with highroll, and wasn't initially recommended due to it seeming underwhelming

# Beastly
- **Hover-Goat**, **Maniacal Laughter**, **Hunting Grounds**, **Interstellar Bounty Hunter**, **Gargantuar-Throwing Gargantuar**, **Zombot 1000**, and **Fraidy Cat** are all Scrap now. They were all weak cards to recommend in the first place, and the meta shifting to Plant tempo has made cards like Maniacal and IBH way worse
- **Secret Agent** is now Keepable. It's not ran as often as before due to the aforementioned meta shift

# Brainy
- **Shield-Crusher Viking** is Use now. It's a decent budget option that does see use in max decks, so it's typically worth keeping

# Crazy
- **Barrel of Deadbeards** in Keepable. It's super niche now since you just don't run it in aggro anymore. Other decks tend to not want BoD since Mission is weak and BoD itself messes with your tempo
- **Imp-Throwing Gargantuar** is scrap. Even with it costing 4, it's still pretty slow and not worth taking. It doesn't really max into anything besides Trickstache either, so keeping it on that basis is also not worth it

# Hearty
- **Zombology Teacher** and **Genetic Experiment** are in Keep and Use respectively. They were underrated at the time for being potentially outclassed by Hearty's new tempo options, but Genetic is still really useful and Teacher is still wanted in maxed decks
- **Jurassic Fossilhead**, **All-Star Zombie**, and **Coffee Zombie** are Scrap. Colosseum, Sumo, and Primeval Yeti are all much more important and useful cards, and once you've unlocked them, then you're putting the sparks towards cards like Viral and Black Hole. By that point, they're hardly even relevant options anymore

# Sneaky
- **Imp-Throwing Imp**, **Toxic Waste Imp**, and **Imposter** are Keepable now. Imps as a strategy is rarely ever played on other heroes besides HG anyway, and even on HG, they're relatively weaker due to Imp Commander's change
- **Laser Base Alpha** is Keepable. It's... fine, I guess. Usable on a budget if you have nothing better, and maxes out on Impfinity now
- **Mixed-Up Gravedigger** and **Pogo Bouncer** are now Keep and Use respectively. Pogo is a lot less niche of a card people had been giving it credit for up until now, while MUG has been seeing more use in these slower Sneaky decks 
- **Zombot Plank Walker**, **Excavator Zombie**, and **Tomb Raiser Zombie** are all scrap. Plankwalker is hard to justify on a budget since Quarterly is so useful on SB and no other heroes can really use this card. Excavator was Keepable for Neptuna, but she hardly runs it now. Tomb Raiser was just overhyped, honestly; it's still an easily controllable 4-drop that needs to hit face to get value
