We can talk over the phone or chat, or catch up with a cup of coffee. We can both yap about how our day went. I'm looking for someone permanent and not temporary, and when the time is right, a lifelong commitment. So to save both of our time chatting, and ended up ghosting each other, here's my deets:

Historical Mystery /Comedy 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Through the curved glass windows of the schooner‚Äôs small but elegant stern gallery, our wake stretches over a vast expanse sparkling blue sea. I should be making entries in the log, but the splendid sunset keeps drawing my attention from its pages. 

Then I see the French Frigate, the Pellier, swing into view as she yaws half a mile off our quarter. The sudden turn points her broadside at our stern, all twenty-four of her gun ports open wide. 

Oh, right; we‚Äôre still under attack. 

My mind loses all meditative expression, and in disappointment I reach for my coffee as the Pellier‚Äôs side vanishes behind a cloud of orange-punched smoke. A moment later comes the thundering crash of her guns, white plumes dotting across our wake where her roundshot strikes the sea, just short of our fleeing schooner. 

One lucky shot bounces off the waves and comes aboard, smashing the cabin windows and shattering the coffee cup in my hand. 

‚ÄúMiss Dangerfield,‚Äù I say, in a voice calculated to penetrate the entire vessel. 

‚ÄúSir?‚Äù Says my steward, her concerned face appearing at the cabin door. Her eyes immediately notice the rustled tablecloth and askew silver dishes, and her expression turns somewhat accusatory. 

As if I‚Äôd personally invited an 18-pound ball aboard at one thousand feet per second. 

‚ÄúAnother cup of you please, ma‚Äôam, thank you,‚Äù I say, as politely as I can manage. 

She salutes sullenly‚Ä¶sarcastically? No, no, she wouldn‚Äôt dare, and vanishes into the galley. 

We‚Äôd have never allowed these insolent looks in the Navy, I reflect. For a moment I gleefully imagine her bare back strapped to the grating, taking half a dozen stripes for insubordination. 

But I‚Äôm no longer part of the Royal Fleet; I‚Äôm a smuggler, and the rules are different now. As captain and part-owner of the schooner, I maintain the same rigid authority, but the crew are volunteers and professional seamen, much less concerned with formalities than your by-the-book man-o-war crews. 

The coffee comes back hot and strong. I drink a few grateful gulps, then fill my cup‚Äîa metal cup, I notice‚Äîand head up on deck. I note with satisfaction that the Frigate had continued to wear and was now pointing away south. 

Mr Blythe turns away from the taffrail when I approach, and scurries over to me. He‚Äôs an odd, squirrelly fellow we picked up in Port Mahon, said he needed a quiet passage, no papers. Adding in the fact that he‚Äôs a Spaniard, speaks Latin, and wears all black; he might as well have the word ‚ÄúAssassin‚Äù tattooed on his forehead. 

He makes me extraordinarily uncomfortable.  

I open my telescope and pretend to focus on a flock of seagulls off our starboard beam, hoping he‚Äôll turn away. 

‚ÄúNot expecting more trouble, Captain?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot presently,‚Äù I said, ‚Äústill - I better go have a look from the masthead.‚Äù 

Slinging my telescope, I spring onto the rigging and scramble aloft like a prime foremast hand. 

The platform at the topmast is crowded: three sailors. The lookout and two off-duty hands, seated on folded piles of sailcloth. I hear the clatter of dice, and one of them scoops something into his mouth. 

All wear guilty expressions; they weren‚Äôt expecting anyone, much less the captain, and even smuggling ships have rules against gambling. 

But I‚Äôm no longer in the mood to flog anyone, and regardless all attention shifts at cries from the deck below: 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that lubber doing? He‚Äôll kill himself!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll break his neck, damn fool!‚Äù 

Glancing over the edge I see Mr. Blythe entangled the rigging. He‚Äôd tried to follow me up, the pragmatical bastard! He slips again and hangs inverted, swinging by his ankles with the roll of the mast. His face shows pure horror. 

Fortunately Miss Dangerfield chose that moment to ascend the opposite rigging with my refreshments, making the climb look easy despite being encumbered by a steaming kettle and silver cigar case. 

She hangs these on a rat line, and leaps for a backstay, swinging across the mast to the rigging with it‚Äôs precarious hold on the assassin. Seizing him by the ankle, she jerks him free and upright and carries him the rest of the way aloft, dumping him in a gasping heap on our platform. 

‚ÄúSir!‚Äù Says the lookout, pointing to the French ship which was now almost disappearing from view, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre flying an alphabetical message.‚Äù 

I focus the eyepiece of my telescope, and the Pelliere springs into view. With her studdingsails abroad and royals she makes a glorious sight on the water. I spell out the flags as they break out on her mizzen top: 

‚ÄúH-A-V-E A N-I-C-E T-R-I-P‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs truly nice of them, Captain,‚Äù says Miss Dangerfield. 

‚ÄúIndeed it is!‚Äù I say, and then ‚ÄúPass the word for our signalmen. You sir: spell out ‚ÄúY-O-U A-S W-E-L-L.‚Äù 

I reach to pick up Mr. Blythe, supporting him beneath his shoulder. ‚ÄúOpen your eyes, Mr. Blythe. The view is quite stunning from here.‚Äù 

Reluctantly he lets them focus. Then his face brightens into something almost like happiness, and he gives a reptilian smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm amazed!‚Äù He says. ‚ÄúAmazed!‚Äù 

‚ÄúTake my glass,‚Äù I say, unsure of why I no longer despise the fellow, ‚Äújust don‚Äôt drop it. There - to the starboard ‚Ä¶ no, to starboard ‚Ä¶there you are sir ‚Ä¶ you can make out the western tip of Formentera.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIncredible!‚Äù He says, whimsically sweeping the telescope in a slow circle of the horizon. 

The tea finally comes up, and I light a cigar. This is the type of sailing I love. 

Blythe suddenly freezes, the glass pointing straight ahead inline with our bow. 

‚ÄúAnd captain‚Ä¶what are those sleek, shiny vessels cruising with such graceful speed around the cliffs there?‚Äù 

It‚Äôs as I feared. We‚Äôd dodged the French Empire, sure, but we‚Äôre small fish for them. It‚Äôs different for these local harbor cops with their ocean flyers: this is all they do. 

‚ÄúBaltimore Clippers,‚Äù I say, without needing to look. I flick my cigar and watch it soar away and fizzle into the ocean. ‚ÄúRevenue Cutters.‚Äù

1msh853,https://i.redd.it/zf8yyyop9ijf1.png,Friend Stole My Husband,"Chapter 1



The doorbell chimed at nearly ten o'clock on a Tuesday evening, its sharp notes cutting through the peaceful quiet of our home. I glanced up from my drawing tablet where I'd been sketching the final panels of my latest comic series, my fountain pen still poised mid-stroke. Byron looked up from his laptop, his brow furrowing as he checked his watch.



""Who could that be at this hour?"" he muttered, already rising from his leather armchair.



I followed him to the foyer, my bare feet silent against the cool marble. Through the frosted glass panels of our front door, I could make out a slight figure hunched over a suitcase. Byron pulled the door open, and there stood Noelle Medina, my childhood friend, looking like a broken bird in the porch light.



Her usually perfect blonde hair hung in disheveled waves around her shoulders, and mascara had left dark streaks down her cheeks. She clutched a small wheeled suitcase with white knuckles, her designer dress wrinkled as if she'd been wearing it for days.



""Iris,"" she whispered, her voice cracking. ""I'm so sorry to show up like this, but I... I didn't know where else to go.""



My heart clenched despite the nagging unease that always seemed to surface around Noelle. We'd been friends since childhood, but our relationship had always carried an undercurrent I couldn't quite name‚Äîa subtle competition that left me feeling simultaneously protective and wary.



""Noelle, what happened?"" I stepped forward, instinctively reaching for her arm.



She collapsed into sobs, her small frame shaking. ""Victor and I... it's over. Really over this time. He changed the locks, Iris. I have nowhere to go, and all the hotels are booked because of that tech conference downtown.""



Byron moved past me, his expression immediately shifting into what I recognized as his protective mode. ""Hey, it's okay,"" he said softly, his voice taking on that gentle tone he usually reserved for wounded animals or distressed clients. ""Come inside. You're safe here.""



I watched as he carefully took her suitcase, his movements deliberate and caring. Something twisted in my stomach‚Äînot jealousy exactly, but a recognition of how quickly he'd stepped into the role of her rescuer.



""Of course you can stay,"" I heard myself saying, though the words felt heavy on my tongue. ""The guest room is ready. You know you're always welcome here.""



Noelle's tear-filled eyes met mine, and for just a moment, I caught something flickering beneath her distress‚Äîwas it calculation? But then she was sobbing again, and I pushed the thought away, feeling guilty for doubting my friend in her moment of need.



""Thank you,"" she whispered, reaching for my hands. Her fingers were ice-cold and trembling. ""I promise it'll just be temporary, until I can figure out the divorce proceedings and find my own place. I just... I can't be alone right now.""



Byron had already disappeared down the hallway with her suitcase, and I could hear him in the guest room, turning on lights and checking that everything was comfortable. When he returned, his sleeves were rolled up and his expression was focused, purposeful.



""I'll make some tea,"" he announced. ""And there's leftover lasagna in the fridge if you're hungry, Noelle.""



""You're both so kind,"" she murmured, sinking onto our cream-colored sofa as if her legs could no longer support her. ""Victor was so cruel at the end. He said things... terrible things about me, about our marriage. I don't know how I'll ever trust anyone again.""



I perched on the edge of the coffee table facing her, studying her face in the soft lamplight. Noelle had always been beautiful in that fragile, porcelain doll way that made men want to protect her. Even now, with her makeup smeared and her hair a mess, she looked like a tragic heroine from a classical painting.



""What exactly happened?"" I asked gently. ""Last month you said things were getting better between you two.""



Her lower lip trembled. ""He was having an affair. With his secretary, if you can believe such a clich√©. When I confronted him, he said I was paranoid and controlling. Then tonight, he just... snapped. Said he wanted me out, that he never loved me, that I was just a burden he'd been carrying for years.""



Byron returned with a steaming mug of chamomile tea, setting it carefully on the side table next to Noelle. His fingers brushed hers as she reached for it, and I noticed how she let the contact linger just a moment longer than necessary.



""No one deserves that kind of treatment,"" Byron said firmly, his jaw tight with what looked like anger on her behalf. ""You did the right thing leaving.""



Noelle's eyes filled with fresh tears as she looked up at him. ""You really think so? I keep wondering if I should have tried harder, been a better wife somehow.""



""Don't you dare blame yourself,"" he replied, his voice surprisingly intense. ""A real man protects his wife, honors her. What Victor did is unforgivable.""



I felt something cold settle in my chest as I watched the exchange. Byron's protective instincts had always been one of the things I loved about him, but seeing them directed so forcefully toward Noelle sent an unexpected chill through me. The way she looked at him‚Äîgrateful, vulnerable, almost worshipful‚Äîstirred memories of our teenage years when she'd always seemed to command the attention of every boy around us.



""I should let you both get some rest,"" I said, standing abruptly. ""Noelle, there are fresh towels in the guest bathroom, and help yourself to anything in the kitchen.""



As I headed toward our bedroom, I caught Byron's voice behind me, low and reassuring: ""Don't worry about anything tonight. Just focus on feeling safe. We'll figure out the rest tomorrow.""



I paused in the doorway, glancing back to see Noelle's small hand resting on Byron's forearm, her eyes locked on his face with an intensity that made my skin prickle. Something about the scene felt orchestrated, too perfect in its vulnerability.



But as I watched my husband's expression soften with genuine concern, I realized that whatever game might be unfolding, Byron was already a willing participant.

Chapter 2

The first crack appeared on a Thursday morning, three weeks after Noelle had moved into our guest room.

I'd been working late in my studio the night before, lost in the intricate details of a particularly emotional scene in my comic where the heroine discovers her best friend's betrayal. The irony wasn't lost on me now. When I finally emerged for coffee around ten, I expected to find the house quiet‚ÄîByron usually left for work by eight, and Noelle had been sleeping in most mornings, claiming the divorce stress was exhausting her.

Instead, I heard low voices coming from the living room, punctuated by Noelle's soft laughter. I paused at the kitchen doorway, coffee mug halfway to my lips, and watched through the archway as my husband sat beside my best friend on our cream sofa, a stack of legal documents spread across the coffee table between them.

""You don't have to worry about any of this,"" Byron was saying, his voice gentler than I'd heard it in months. ""I'll help you understand every clause. Victor's lawyer is trying to intimidate you, but we won't let that happen.""

Noelle's hand fluttered to her throat‚Äîthat nervous gesture I remembered from childhood whenever she was about to cry. ""I don't know what I'd do without you, Byron. You're so much kinder than Victor ever was.""

Something cold twisted in my stomach as I watched Byron's expression soften, the same protective look he used to reserve for me. When had he started looking at her like that?

""Byron?"" I called out, stepping into the living room. ""Don't you have that client meeting at ten-thirty?""

He glanced at his watch, startled. ""Right, yes. I should‚Äî"" He started to gather the papers, but Noelle's small hand covered his.

""Could we finish this tonight?"" she asked, her blue eyes wide and vulnerable. ""I'm finally starting to understand the property division clauses, and I don't want to lose momentum.""

""Of course,"" he replied immediately. ""We'll go through everything until you feel confident.""

I sipped my coffee, tasting bitter grounds. ""I thought Elena was helping you with the legal aspects, Noelle. Isn't that what divorce attorneys are for?""

Noelle's smile flickered for just a moment. ""Oh, she is. But Byron explains things so much more clearly. He makes it all seem less scary.""

After Byron left for work, the house felt different somehow‚Äîcharged with an undercurrent I couldn't name. I tried to focus on my drawings, but my mind kept drifting to the way Noelle had looked at my husband, the way she'd touched his hand with such familiarity.

Two days later, I walked in on them again.

I'd been in my studio since early morning, working on deadline sketches, when I realized I'd forgotten my reference books in the living room. The house was quiet‚Äîtoo quiet‚Äîas I padded down the hallway in my socks.

They were on the sofa again, but this time there were no legal documents in sight. Noelle was curled against Byron's side, her head resting on his chest, his fingers threading through her blonde hair in slow, hypnotic strokes. Her eyes were closed, and she looked so small and fragile nestled against him. Byron's expression was soft, almost reverent, as he gazed down at her.

Neither of them noticed me at first. I stood frozen in the archway, watching my husband touch another woman with the tenderness that used to be mine alone. The intimacy of the moment hit me like a physical blow‚Äîthis wasn't comfort between friends. This was something else entirely.

""Oh!"" Noelle's eyes snapped open when she finally saw me, and she jerked upright, her cheeks flushing pink. ""Iris, I didn't hear you come in.""

Byron's hand dropped from her hair, but he didn't move away from her on the sofa. His face cycled through surprise, guilt, and then something that looked almost defiant.

""I was just‚Äî"" Noelle's voice wavered. ""I had another nightmare about Victor. Byron was helping me calm down.""

I looked between them, noting how Byron's arm remained draped along the back of the sofa behind her shoulders, how neither of them seemed inclined to put proper distance between themselves.

""In the middle of the afternoon?"" I asked quietly.

Byron's jaw tightened. ""She's been having panic attacks, Iris. I was just trying to help.""

The way he said my name‚Äîlike an accusation, like I was the one being unreasonable‚Äîsent ice through my veins. When had I become the outsider in my own home?

""Of course,"" I said, my voice steady despite the tremor in my hands. ""I just came for my books.""

I gathered the reference materials from the coffee table, acutely aware of how they both watched me, of the guilty silence that stretched between us. As I turned to leave, I caught Noelle's reflection in the hallway mirror‚Äîshe wasn't looking distressed or grateful for Byron's comfort. She was smiling.

Chapter 3

The dinner party was my idea‚Äîa desperate attempt to reclaim normalcy in my own home. I'd invited Marcus and his wife Sarah, along with Elena and her husband David, hoping that the presence of friends would somehow restore the natural order that had been slowly eroding over the past month.

I spent the afternoon preparing Byron's favorite lamb dish, arranging white roses in crystal vases, setting our best china on the mahogany dining table. The house looked perfect, elegant and welcoming. If I could just create the right atmosphere, maybe we could remember who we used to be.

Noelle emerged from the guest room as our friends arrived, transformed from her usual disheveled state into something ethereal. She wore a flowing navy dress that made her look fragile and luminous, her blonde hair swept into a soft updo that emphasized the delicate curve of her neck. I caught Byron's sharp intake of breath when he saw her, and something cold settled in my chest.

""Iris, this is absolutely beautiful,"" Sarah exclaimed, admiring the table setting. ""You always have such exquisite taste.""

""Thank you,"" I murmured, watching as Byron immediately moved to Noelle's side, his hand hovering protectively near her elbow.

""Noelle, how are you holding up?"" Marcus asked gently, his expression concerned. ""Byron mentioned you're going through a difficult divorce.""

Noelle's lower lip trembled slightly, and she glanced up at Byron with those wide, vulnerable eyes. ""It's been... challenging. But Byron has been such an incredible support. I don't know what I would have done without him.""

Her small hand found his forearm, her fingers curling around his sleeve with practiced fragility. Byron's chest seemed to expand with pride at her words, his protective instincts clearly activated.

""That's what friends are for,"" Elena said warmly, though I caught her sharp glance between Noelle and Byron.

As we moved to the dining room, I watched Noelle orchestrate her performance with subtle precision. When Byron pulled out her chair, she looked up at him with such grateful adoration that our friends couldn't help but notice. When he served the wine, she touched his wrist lightly, murmuring ""thank you"" in a voice barely above a whisper.

""Byron, you're such a gentleman,"" Sarah observed with a smile. ""Iris is lucky to have such a caring husband.""

But Byron's attention was fixed on Noelle, who had grown quiet, staring down at her plate with an expression of barely contained sorrow.

""Are you alright?"" he asked softly, leaning toward her with genuine concern.

""I'm sorry,"" Noelle whispered, her voice catching. ""Sometimes it just hits me‚Äîhow Victor used to criticize everything I did. He never pulled out my chair or asked if I was comfortable. Being around such kindness just reminds me of what I never had.""

The table fell silent, everyone's heart clearly going out to her. Byron's jaw tightened with anger on her behalf, and without hesitation, he reached over to squeeze her hand.

""You deserve so much better than that,"" he said firmly, his thumb stroking across her knuckles. ""Any man would be honored to take care of you.""

I felt my fork grow heavy in my hand as I watched my husband hold another woman's hand at our dinner table, in front of our friends, with such tender intimacy that it made my throat close up.

""Byron's right,"" Marcus agreed, though I caught him glancing at me with concern. ""You're among friends here, Noelle. We all want to see you happy.""

Throughout dinner, the performance continued. Noelle laughed at Byron's jokes with musical delight, her hand fluttering to his shoulder when she found something particularly amusing. When she needed the salt, she asked Byron specifically, her fingers brushing his as he passed it. When she mentioned feeling cold, he immediately offered his jacket, draping it around her shoulders with such gentleness that our friends exchanged meaningful looks.

I sat at the head of my own table, watching my marriage dissolve in real time while our friends witnessed Byron transform into Noelle's devoted protector. Every touch, every shared glance, every moment of tender care that used to belong to me was now directed toward her with an intensity that left me breathless.

""Iris, you've barely touched your food,"" Elena observed quietly.

""I'm fine,"" I managed, though the lamb tasted like ash in my mouth.

As the evening wound down, Noelle excused herself to rest, claiming exhaustion from the emotional strain. Byron immediately stood to escort her, his hand settling on the small of her back as he guided her from the room.

""Thank you all for being so welcoming,"" Noelle said softly, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. ""It means everything to have such wonderful friends during this difficult time.""

After she disappeared down the hallway, an uncomfortable silence settled over the table. Our friends exchanged glances, clearly unsure how to address what they'd witnessed.

""Iris,"" Sarah began carefully, ""is everything‚Äî""

""Everything's fine,"" I cut her off, my voice sharper than intended. ""Noelle's been through a lot. We're just trying to help.""

But as I began clearing the dishes, my hands shaking slightly, I caught Elena's worried expression in the reflection of the china cabinet glass. She'd seen through Noelle's performance, recognized the calculated nature of every touch and glance.

The realization that my marriage was crumbling publicly, that my friends were witnessing my husband's devotion transfer to another woman in my own dining room, hit me with devastating clarity. I wasn't just losing Byron‚ÄîI was losing him in front of everyone who mattered to us, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.",1,1755404133.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

To be honest I was never into it because Alex putting up those pictures of Izzie really disgusted me, for context I watched this show in one go recently so it doesn't help that I watched with a modern perspective.

1msh5g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1msh5g0/a_stain_not_a_floor/,A stain not a floor,"I always thought my life was too boring for anything strange to happen to me. Work, home, Netflix, sleep. But one day, I started to notice something different about my living room floor.

It was just a dark stain, an undefined blur, as if someone had spilled coffee and never cleaned it up properly. But the more I looked, the more it looked like... a face.

At first, I laughed about it. I even commented to myself:
‚Äî ""Okay, guy, you're getting paranoid. You can even see the face in the grout.""

But the stain responded to me.

‚Äî ""No, you're not going crazy.""

The voice didn't come from anywhere. It was muffled, serious, as if it were echoing inside my head.

Over the next few days, she would talk to me about trivial things:
‚ÄúToday the weather will get cold.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou should call your mom.‚Äù
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget to drink water.‚Äù

The scariest? She was always right. The climate changed as she said. My mother told me that she was sick on the same day that the stain told me to call. Even water... I started to feel thirsty only when she mentioned it.

Over time, the voice became more intimate.
‚Äî ‚ÄúYou have talent. You should write that book you always thought about.‚Äù
‚Äî ‚ÄúYou were born for more, don‚Äôt you understand?‚Äù

It was like a secret friend who knew me better than I knew myself. I got addicted to it. I would come home running just to hear what she had to say to me.

But as the days went by, the messages began to change tone.
‚Äî ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trust your neighbor.‚Äù
‚Äî ‚ÄúPeople laugh at you when you leave the house.‚Äù
‚Äî ‚ÄúSomeone is going to betray you soon.‚Äù

And then, the orders began:
‚Äî ‚ÄúThrow away that old portrait. He‚Äôs watching you.‚Äù
‚Äî ‚ÄúChange all the light bulbs. The light is unreliable.‚Äù
‚Äî ‚ÄúSleep on the floor today. It‚Äôs safer.‚Äù

I obeyed. Always.

Until one night, I woke up with my voice almost shouting:
‚Äî ‚ÄúGet up. Go to the mirror.‚Äù

I went. I looked at myself. Tired, deep dark circles, but nothing more.
‚Äî ‚ÄúTake a better look.‚Äù

And it was then that I realized: there was no reflection at all from the floor behind me.

I ran back to the room. The stain was bigger, pulsing, almost breathing. And she said, laughing for the first time:
‚Äî ‚ÄúNow you understand.‚Äù

I shouted:
‚Äî ‚ÄúWhat are you?!‚Äù

The voice became calm again:
‚Äî ""I am you. The reflection you never had the courage to face. Everything you ever wanted to be, everything you ever feared. And now...""

The stain began to rise from the ground, like a solid shadow, taking on human form. My shape.
But she smiled in a way I never would.

‚Äî ‚ÄúYou haven't lived your life for weeks. Who's making the decisions? Who's leading you? You let yourself go... and now you no longer need a weak body.‚Äù

Before I could run, the shadow fell over me. I felt my body sink into the cold floor, as if I was being sucked into the stain itself.

The last sound I heard was my own voice, coming out of her, saying:
‚Äî ‚ÄúFinally, free.‚Äù

When I opened my eyes, I was on the floor. In the dark. Looking up.
The stain... myself, now walked around the room, in my body, living my life.

And I stayed there. Arrested. Just a shadow on the ground.",1,1755403883.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/16GsPWv1Wa): **January 19, 2025**

Throwaway Account

I (33f) met have been in a 10 year relationship with my boyfriend ""Carl"" (33m). After the first year of our relationship I made it very clear that I intended to be a wife someday. By the time I was 28 I started to remind him of my goals and expectations and Carl told me that while he knew he wanted to marry me he just wasn't ready yet and didn't like how I was pressuring him and called me controlling. Eventually we broke up but six months later we got back together and even moved in.

Looking back on it now, I realize that that wasn't the best decision but I was so emotionally attached to this man and felt so invested that I was willing to go back to him. Carl and I have now been living together for four years and while I stopped being happy about it after the first six months, living with him isn't a bad experience. Plus I always thought that us getting married was just around the corner, because he said he was ready to commit to me but he wanted to wait for the right time because I deserved a ""perfect proposal"" and a more stable husband.

I've been going to therapy for the past two years and recently had an epiphany. Since childhood I have always wanted a wedding but never really gave much thought to being a married woman 24/7 and what that would mean. Given my country's shift in politics and new laws that politicians are trying to pass, I realized that not only am I fine with never getting married but I'm starting to lean more into no longer possessing the desire to do it.

Since then it feels like I've been set free in a way and started focusing on myself. One of the major things that I've done is tell Carl that I'll no longer assist with babysitting his nephews and niece and instead focus more of my time into getting certified in something to increase my earning potential and just relaxing. Carl seemed nonchalant about it at first but then said that we needed to have a sit down when I sent Carl's mom and his brother a text that they had three weeks before I stopped helping out completely.

Carl said that while he understands my desire for more personal time, it's important to be there and sacrifice for family. I told him that he could switch around his own work schedule and help with the kids since they're technically his family, and he said that the children love me and that one day they'd be my family too once we were man and wife.

It was in that moment that I told him that I no longer desired marriage and while I gave my reasons Carl still took it as me wanting to break up with him and/or thinking that he would make a terrible husband. That is not the case at all but he's starting to lash out and get suspicious and I just don't know what to do. How can I get my boyfriend to see that it's me not him?

TL;DR: I realized that I no longer want to get married and my boyfriend of 10 years is taking it as a personal strike against him.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received mixed responses, but was leaning toward NTA**

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** I am curious what Carl‚Äôs mom and brother required your help with that you needed to give 3 weeks notice that you would no longer be helping with? Was it the niece and nephews childcare or something more?

> **OOP:** Carl's brother has 50/50 custody of his children but childcare after school is expensive where we live so his mom was initially watching the kids but it was getting to be too much so I offered to help out and it's been that way for about three years. I don't feel right just quitting on something like this without notice and wanted to emotionally prepare the kids that they may not see me as often as before.

**Commenter 2:**

> Given my country's shift in politics and new laws that politicians are trying to pass, I realized that not only am I fine with never getting married but I'm starting to lean more into no longer possessing the desire to do it.

what does this mean?

> **OOP:** I live in America and in one of the Southern states. There are some politicians who want to put in laws that I personally don't think would be for my benefit in regards to marriage and if they're successful then I definitely never want to be married someone.

**Does OOP live close to her family or Carl's family for any additional support / help?**

> **OOP:** We don't live close enough to my family for Carl to consistently offer any help on a regular basis.

**Downvoted Commenter:** YTA flat out. You string him along for 10 years with the goal to get married and now do a 180 without warning. Of course he gets suspicious. Also you never said why he wasnt ready for marriage. Does he have financial problems? Mental health issues he wanted to work on before? Also it reads like you dont even see him as a partner anymore but as a roommate. You just pulled the rug under him. Of course it looks like a breakup. And i dont understand how people are defending you. You fucked up bad time. I would not be surprised at all if he packs his bags now and leaves

> **OOP:** How was I string him along when he was the one who kept putting it off? Also what was there to warn him about? I can't speak for Carl as to why her never felt ready. I can only tell you what he told me. We've lived together for a couple years and he's never talked about having mental health or financial issues. I've noticed no change in his behavior either.
> 
> I also made it very clear that while I no longer desired marriage I still wanted to be in the relationship. So I don't know where ""break up"" would come up.

**Commenter 3:** Do the two of you want children? If not, there's no reason to get married.

> **OOP:** I don't know what to call it but I'm between wanting kids and being childfree. I could really go either way. Although given where I live in America right now I would NOT give birth in the state that I live in.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/IKlvi0ghsr): **August 10, 2025 (almost seven months later)**

UPDATE: I (33f) Told My Boyfriend (33m) That I'm No Longer Interested In Marriage

Hello everyone!

Sorry for taking so long but a lot has happened and I ended up forgetting about this and focusing on other things. Then I saw a notification from a recent DM so I thought I'd give an update.

TL;DR: We broke up and live separately.

For more details please continue reading below.

Okay so things were a little tense over the next few days because we were either fighting or just not talking to each other. He even moved into the spare bedroom one day and he stopped giving me money for his share of the streaming services that we both use and I technically pay for. I even but to mute his mama and brother for a little bit. Then once Valentine's Day was right around the corner he did a complete 180 and started speaking to me again and even apologized for his initial reaction and seemed really receptive to hearing my reasons.

He then he told me he planned a special day for us the weekend after Valentine's Day which I was delighted to hear. On the day of I woke up to him gone but with breakfast laid out for me and a text message saying that there was work emergency and that he had to go in for a couple hours and told me to go meet him at the movie theater downtown by 3PM. I thought cool. I chilled for a bit then got ready and headed out. By 2:55PM I sent him a text message asking where he was and responded by saying he accidentally type the wrong time and that the movie wouldn't start until 5PM, and he meant was that he wouldn't be able to leave work until 3PM.

He's had a case of fat fingers and butt dials before so I initially didn't think much and just decided to go walking around by outlet close by to kill time. Then I got another text saying that he'd change our online ticket reservations because he was still stuck at the office and to just chill until 7PM. This time I grew suspicious but instead of calling or texting back with questions I just gave him a thumbs and sent a selfie of me at one of my favorite stores, then started to drive back home.

Normally getting back to our apartment from the downtown area where I was at around this time of day on a weekend can be a bit of a challenge but today traffic was decent. Then when I pull up to complex I see a moving truck. No big deal January/February is when a lot of people have moved out or in before so I understood.

Why did I see some of Carl's friends near the truck?

Why did I see some of Carl's friend moving the couch that I paid for into the truck?

I called the police and told them that I was actively being robbed. I stayed in the car for a while trying to calm myself down until I saw Carl helping a man load my bookshelf into the back of his pick up truck. I got out and confronted him.

This man was trying to keep me out of the apartment all day so he could quietly move out and take my furniture. And I say ""my"" furniture because I was the one who picked it all out and paid for most of everything and I readily shared the email confirmation order number(s)/receipts that I had archived when the police showed up. The man tried to take my bookshelf because apparently Carl had sold it to him, but that wasn't my problem and that I'd press charges on everyone if my stuff wasn't back in my place.

We got into a huge argument and the police tried to brush this off as a civil matter since Carl and I lived together but I went into the station the next day and spoke to a female officer who was of better help. My dining room set, spices, blender, groceries, lamps, TV, coffee table, and mattress were gone but Carl's friends did put back the couch which was a pull out.

The middle man between my landlord and me did speak to Carl about wanting to take his name off the lease but did not follow the proper protocol and confirming with me that I would take on full responsibility of rent so I did file a complaint. I ended up leaving the complex and moving somewhere else and pressed charges against Carl and his friends if only to create a paper trail and help in my civil case against my ex.

In the end I was able to get some financial compensation for what I lost and he has until November to pay it all.

I wasn't even sad that he didn't want to be with me anymore just pissed off at how he tried to go about it. It is very clear that he wanted to ""punish"" me and I'm so glad that I never ended up marrying this man. I completed my certification, got a promotion and the pay raise that comes with it, and my dad has agreed to give me the money he was saving for my future wedding as a downpayment for house. After this entire experience I am now ten toes down in never getting married.

Also as a side note since Carl's brother couldn't provide consistent child care on his days the mother filed for full custody and now Carl's brother pays child support.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** So I was expecting that Carl found his person and is engaged and getting married soon.

At your ages delaying an engagement/marriage when you have been together that long and have your adult jobs is being comfortable in the relationship but not sure the other one is really ""the one"". Becomes a habit?

> **OOP:** I don't know about marriage but from what I was told by his mom (who I didn't ask) he does have a new girlfriend. So good luck to her.

**Commenter 2:** My only question is, why did it take you so long ( 10 years, if I remember correctly) to figure out this guy was a complete loser?! Good for you! Better late than never.

> **OOP:** Because I always idolized the idea of getting married and just like I said in my original post I developed an emotional attachment to my ex. Plus a little bit of the ""Sunk Cost"" mindset, but I know better now.

**Commenter 3:** You dodged a nuke.

What a world class asshole. Robbing you on his way out. And you just know how much he enjoyed picturing you coming home to an empty place.

You're getting the best revenge. A court judgment and living your best life.
> 
> **Commenter 4:** Idk feels kinda suspicious... Who decides to wait TWO WHOLE HOURS instead of going back home? Like what?
>> 
>> **OOP:** I was shopping.

I‚Äôve been around family as they drank, but it was always responsibly and they‚Äôve never done anything bad, harmful, or irresponsible(that I know of) while drunk.

I just, I guess it‚Äôs not alcohol I fear, it‚Äôs addiction. 

In the past, when I got sad, angry, just, any emotion that wasn‚Äôt happy, I drink an energy drink. It‚Äôs my ‚Äúfuck you emotions, I‚Äôm gonna drown you in caffeine.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know where it came from or why I do it, but I did it for years.

A few months ago I quit all energy drinks, cold turkey, until I didn‚Äôt crave them anymore before implementing a rule when I can only drink them on Holidays(real Holidays, days like national cat day don‚Äôt count) or if I‚Äôm going somewhere(like to a birthday party, I can‚Äôt have one if I‚Äôm going grocery shopping or on a walk, I have to be going somewhere where I will interact with people for more than an hour).

But I just, fear that. Because what‚Äôs stopping it from being alcohol? I‚Äôve had thoughts in the past, after I stopped drinking the energy drinks, when I‚Äôd get emotional, the thoughts crept in, drink alcohol. And I never have and at this rate I never plan to. 

I just, don‚Äôt understand where the idea of drowning my emotions in some new liquid came from. First it was energy drinks, not all caffeine, I‚Äôve never had this issue with coffee or tea, just energy drinks, and now I‚Äôm scared that if I drink, it‚Äôll become a problem. And I just, don‚Äôt know why.

I don‚Äôt know where the problem of me drowning my feelings in different drinks came from. But I had it, and it stuck, and I‚Äôve stopped it now but I just, fear the thought that if I drink alcohol, I won‚Äôt be able to stop it.

And I don‚Äôt want to fear it. I don‚Äôt want to be the one who won‚Äôt touch alcohol. I don‚Äôt want to be the one that people always question why I won‚Äôt drink only for me to have to explain this. I don‚Äôt want to be the one who doesn‚Äôt trust herself enough to drink alcohol.

I don‚Äôt want to be that girl.

And I know I‚Äôm just a teenager now, so maybe I‚Äôll grow out of it, but I‚Äôve had this fear for years and it‚Äôs only really gotten worse. 

And I just, hate that so much.",1,1755403239.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

It posted by accident while I was working on it when my cat, Scully, decided to walk across my laptop. Once it started to post I couldn't stop it but then couldn't find it. Anyway...I'm sorry you guys! Here is the completed story...hence, Attempt #2.

Let me start by saying this is a long one so buckle up...

I've worked in the hospitality industry for years. I say hospitality instead of hotel/motel because some were timeshare resorts and one was a private realty company that rented privately owned condos, cottages, and beach houses. This story relates to the last one, the realty company.

I worked front desk for a vacation realty office in North Myrtle Beach for about 9 months. The job was okay. I had a lot of responsibilities and some days it just didn't seem worth it but it was a job with decent pay and great hours. We were open 9am to 5pm Mon - Fri and 9am to Noon on Sat, closed Sundays. There were only 3 of us in an office that shared space with a realtor, an interior decorator, and a contractor that built beach houses. The office manager had her office in the back and myself and another woman had the front desk area. You could say it was a small operation.

The properties we rented for the owners ranged in value from $210K to $3.5 million and one valued at $15 million. Our guidelines were strict with owners in that the properties must remain maintained and updated with everything in good working order. With that being said, we were uber strict with our policies for guests. Here are the most important ones:

1. Any guest that checks into our properties outside of normal business hours will be given a code to a lockbox located at the front of our office. Keys, parking passes, and important information will be in the registered guests name and inside the box. All registered guests checking in after hours are required to come into the office the following business day to sign the registration card and provide the office staff with a copy of a valid driver's licence or government ID and a major credit card, the name and age of every guest staying in the property, vehicle and tag information for all vehicles kept on the property. Failure to do so in a timely manner will result in the guests being removed from the property, the remainder of the reservation cancelled, and NO REFUND will be given.
2. NO ONE under the age of 25 was allowed to rent any of our properties, or, occupy any of our properties without the registered responsible adult being over 25 years of age, present, AND occupying the same property as the other guests under the age of 25 during the exact same time period reserved. Anyone found violating this policy will be removed from the property, will have the remainder of their reservation cancelled, and NO REFUND will be given.
3. You are allowed only a certain number of parking passes as parking spaces are limited for each property. Maximum number will be 2 or 4 and only 1 pass per registered vehicle will be issued during the stay. Replacement passes are not given out so it is their responsibility to keep up with it. Unregistered vehicles, or vehicles without the issued parking pass displayed clearly, and on property for more than 24 hours, will be towed at owner's expense.
4. Do NOT park on any grassy area or on the side of the roads unless parking spaces are clearly marked. Do NOT park in front of another home or in another property's driveway or garage area. Vehicles found violating this policy will be towed at owner's expense.
5. Absolutely NO HOUSE PARTIES WILL BE TOLERATED! These are privately owned homes and the owners expect guests to be able to contain themselves and act like responsible adults. Drinking age in SC is 21. Underage drinking is not allowed by law. Violation of this policy will result in occupants being removed, the remainder of the reservation cancelled, and NO REFUND will be given.
6. Banners and flags are NOT to be displayed on the property, hung from banisters or balconies, and no signs posted in the yards. Renters are required to have a copy of a legal permit issued by the City of North Myrtle Beach to do so. Violators will be issued a citation by the North Myrtle Beach Police Department and fined $200 a day for each day said banners/flags/signs are illegally displayed.
7. Please let us know if something is missing or not working. If during your stay, an item is accidentally broken, let us know and we will replace it or notify the owners. Broken glasses, dishes, picture frames, pool toys, chairs, and the like, are part of normal wear and tear and can happen to anyone at anytime. However, if the item broken or destroyed holds a value of more than $25, it will up to the owner of the home whether the registered guest is to be held responsible for paying for the item or replacing it. We expect all guest to treat the property and its contents with respect.
8. If a closet or outside door is locked then it is to remain locked. These are private storage locations for the owners. If you are given access to any locked doors, the key or code will be provided to you upon check-in.
9. All linens, including bath towels and beach towels, are provided for our guests. Blankets and additional pillows will be found in the closets. Pool/beach toys, pool noodles, chairs, coolers, and umbrellas are also provided for you by the owners. High chairs, cribs, and pack-and-plays can be provided with advance notice or rented from a local business after check-in. Details provided in the welcome packet with the keys.
10. Motorcycles and trailers are not permitted in North Myrtle Beach.
11. Dogs and cats are permitted in our pet-friendly properties only and are not permitted in any of our other properties unless authorization by the owner is given prior to check-in. Documentation from a recent vet visit may be required to ensure proper shots and flea/tick treatments have been administered to the animal. The dog must not be on the banned and restricted breed listing we have in the office. You must clean up after your dog or cat! Waste bins with poop bags are located throughout the city. Do NOT allow your pet to urinate or defecate in the yard of any privately held residence. The City of North Myrtle Beach will fine anyone violating the ""poop"" law up to $1000. They do have the way and means to verify if it was your animal or not so don't chance it.
12. No glass is to be taken to any of the pool areas. Cans, plastic cups, and plastic bottles are permitted.

Whew....that was a hell of a lot to type, but important information to have for this episode. You'll soon see why.

On this day it was a Saturday in May, 2 weeks before Memorial Day. Now in the NMB and MB area, the week before Memorial Day is known as Black Bike Week. It's when all the street bikes, aka ""crotch rockets"" appear. This goes on into the next weekend when they start to drift out and the Harleys drift in. The Harley rally is the week of Memorial Day and bikers start to arrive on the Friday of the holiday weekend and stay thru the next weekend. So this took place before either rally.

So, it was the Saturday before the 1st bike rally. We were only open until 12 Noon so most guests had already arrived during the night or would be arriving that afternoon/evening. All those that came in the night before after hours showed up to check-in and supply us with the necessary documents. All except one ""family"" from Chicago. Yep, the Windy City itself. ChiTown.

I called them but didn't get an answer; voicemail answered. I didn't panic over it. It's a very long drive from Chicago to Myrtle Beach, SC and I knew the guests had to be tired so I figured I'd give them a call a little later, before I left.

For this story I will use the names Ken, Barbie, Jr, Chewbacca, and Mr. and Mrs. Chicago.

It was 11:30 and I decided to call the ChiTown folks back. A young man answered and I said, ""Hi, this is the front desk at ##Realty. Is Mrs. Chicago available?""

""Uh, no. She actually just left to go pick up some groceries. Can I have her call you back?""

""That may be hard to do as our office closes at 12:00. What is your name?"", I asked.

""It's Ken. I'm her son.""

""Hi Ken. I'm #######. I really do need to speak to your Mom. Is this not her cell phone number? It's the number she left on the reservation."", I stated.

He nervously replied, ""Uh, yeah, it's her number. She forgot her cell phone and I thought it was my Dad calling about it so that's why I picked up.""

Hmmm....Mom leaves her cell phone at a beach rental, in a strange city, and Ken thought the call coming in was Dad with a SC area code. Noted.

""Oh, well that happens. What is your Dad's cell number then? I can speak to him instead.""

""Ungh, umm..he's not down here. He's at home. He had to work this week and couldn't take off. But, I'll tell Mom to call you when she gets here.""

""Ken, is it? Ken, as I stated earlier the office closes at 12 and it's 20 'til now. She won't be back anytime soon if she's grocery shopping so let me leave you another number for her to call. We'll need her to come in and register or you'll have to vacate the property.""

""Oh, I'll give her the message. What's the number?"", Ken said with a shaky voice.

I gave him my cell number and told him I would meet her at the office to take care of the paperwork so they can continue on and enjoy their vacation. Once he hung up I immediately called my manager and informed her of the situation and the phone call. She said not to worry about it and if they didn't call, she would handle it Monday morning. Great! One less headache for me, or so I thought.

Now my work routine never changes when I come in. I unlock the door, go inside, lock it back, turn off the alarm, turn on all the lights, make a cup of coffee, then grab a pen and notepad and check voicemail left over the weekend. Just routine calls; missing pillow case from the linen pack (supplied by a linen company), sheets the wrong size, only 5 bowls instead of 6, etc. The normal until the last two. One was from my manager asking me to call her when I got in and the last one.....oh, the last one...was the OWNERS of the million dollar beach house, the very one that Mrs. Chicago had rented, stating they were coming down during the week to look at another property to purchase and would stop by before they left. OMG! The shit is about to hit the fan!

I scramble and call my manager back and she informs me she will not be in because her child is sick with a fever and she will be taking her to a doctor. She instructs me to call the owners, let them know she is out of the office but will call them later in the day and to get more info on when they will be in the area. As for Mrs. Chicago and the crew, I knew the policies and procedures and was to handle it the best way possible and if they had to be vacated from the property, I was to let her know. Gotcha!

I quickly called the owners. They would be there on Wednesday, around lunch time. Now, to call the renters.

I don't know why I thought this call would be any different. I kept telling myself that Mrs. Chicago would be there, come on in and complete the paperwork, and all would be fine. It's never that easy. I know better than to second guess my own intuition when it's screaming, ""DANGER! DANGER, Will Robinson!""

This time a young woman answered the phone. ""Hi. This is XXXXX from the front desk. May I speak to Mrs. Chicago please?"", I asked.

""She's not available right now. Can I ask what the call is about?"", she asked.

""Sure, you may ask and what is your name?""

""Excuse me?"", she said.

""What is your name? I like to know who I'm speaking with and since you know my name I would like to know yours."", I replied with just enough snark to my voice.

""I'm Barbie, her daughter. So what is the call about?""

""Well, Barbie, the call is about your mother being the registered responsible party for the property you are currently renting yet she can't seem to come to the office to register."" Suddenly there was a lot of garbled noise and another voice comes on the line. It was Ken. I guess she had me on speaker when he heard the exchange.

""Hi! This is Ken. I'm sorry but that was my sister. She just got here. Mom said she would call you as soon as she gets out of the shower. I'm sorry about all of this but it's been hectic with my Dad not here to help out.""

Yeah, I bet. I could have just become an uber bitch and demanded she be put on the phone now or the police would be called but that would spoil all the fun. See, my intuition has never let me down. Not once. And my spidey sense was tingling something fierce!

So this was my reply. ""Ken, what kind of car does your mother drive?""

""Um, what?""

""What kind of car does your mother drive? It's a simple question. She drove down so you should know, right?""

""Uh, oh, she drives a grey Benz S 550, not sure of the year.""

""Ok, thanks Ken. I know what to look for when your mom comes in to register. I thank you for your  time and remember tell her she has until 2:00 to call and come in. Have a great day!"", and I hang up.

I am now giddy with anticipation! I know just what to do and I should feel bad for them but I don't. I unlock the doors at 9 and start my work. Around 10:30 am I still have not received a call, but I didn't expect to, when it dawned on me...this property has surveillance cameras hidden all over the place. I quickly call my manager and fill her in and ask about the cameras. She told me they had more than 20 hidden cameras, and I mean hidden cameras, and where to find the unlock code to view the footage and how to access it. Since my coworker came in at 11am I was instructed to wait until then and to go into her office to view the footage. She then gave me permission to leave the office to go and inspect/investigate the property and report back to her on what I find. Noted!

At 11 am I filled in the other woman on some of what was happening, not all of it, and went into the manager's office to access the footage. I went back to Friday night and damn, what a find! At 9:34 pm a Range Rover and a Mustang pull into the drive and park. 7 people get out and go about unloading and taking it up the stairs to the side door. Then a 3rd vehicle arrives, a Toyota Tundra truck, and proceeds to park in the grass, spinning tires a little when they do. Out jumps 3 people and a huge Rottweiler. Chewbacca immediately goes over to the owners prized potted Japanese maple tree and pisses all over it. I could see the stream hitting the leaves these cameras were so good!

I flip to the door camera and see a young man enter the door code (Ken) and can see the face of every single person entering the house. Low and behold! So far, no Mom and no Benz. Just college kids that immediately drop their things in the floor and run around the house like it's a free-for-all. One interior cam shows two guys go into the kitchen and put a cooler on the floor and a 12-pack of Yuengling bottles on the bar top. I watch them run from room to room, picking out the one they want. All but one had oceanfront balconies, the kids bunk room, and then they notice the pool. Within minutes they each exit the bedrooms in bathing suits and descend upon the pool.

Now don't get your panties in a bunch. There are no cameras inside the bedrooms or bathrooms, however, there is a camera positioned over each of the balconies from the outside and the window into the kids bedroom because it is accessible from the wrap around deck extending from beachside. So, that's 6 cameras, 1 on the driveway, 1 on the underside carport area, 1 on the underside facing the ocean for walk ups, the door camera, the interior doorway camera, the cam over the fireplace in the living room, one in the dining area, 2 in the main kitchen, one in the each of the interior hallways and there were 3 because the house is 3 floors, one in the game room, 2 in the owner's private bar and private kitchen on the 3rd floor, 1 in the loft library, and 4 on the back exterior; 2 on the pool and 2 on the deck and walkway to the beach. (The homeowner owns a high-tech security company and personal/home protection is what he does...and he's damned good at it too!) I'll let you guess as to the value of the home. Take a guess...come on. It's not that hard to figure it out. I'm just glad they never discovered the house was fully automated, but it wouldn't have mattered if they did because the owners kept the automation turned off until they come to stay.

I skip around and watch each of the kids bring a glass beer bottle out to the pool until they finally get tired of going inside and bring the beer cooler to them. Empties are left poolside, right on the edge, on the tables, beside the loungers but none going into the trash. I watch one girl floating in the pool, beer bottle in hand, suddenly whip around at someone calling her and bang the bottle against the side of the pool, breaking out the bottom and pouring beer into the pool. Another girl dove down and retrieved the broken glass but there was no way to determine how much glass was still in the pool.

I saw Chewbacca roaming the pool and house freely, going in and out the open sliding glass doors on the back deck. Watched the beast chew up a couch pillow, piss on a wall in the dining room and take a massive dump in the corner of the living room, then run outside to the pool.

I watched a little longer to see more beer bottles pile up, a Domino's delivery driver show up with 4 pizzas, the kids ate, drank more, swam more, then called it a night around 1 am. I guess all that driving just wore their poor little bodies out. Yeah, right!

Saturday was more of the same with a group heading down to the beach around noonish, Chewbacca in tow. Some slept in but most were outdoors. I found a sign posted in the living room window from the outside camera. That one got past me but nothing else did. It read,""ChiTown Spring Break 2019!""

Saturday afternoon another car arrived. This one a Honda CRV with 2 male occupants. They unloaded and went into the kids bunk room then changed and out to the pool. They at least had the decency to park in the driveway and not the grass. Then around 6 pm a 5th car showed up, this one a Corvette with 2 female occupants and they too parked in the drive, unloaded, and went into the bunkroom where they changed and went down to the pool.

Still, no Mrs. Chicago and no Benz.

Sunday morning I watched one of the girls find the pile of dog shit and drape a couple of paper towels over it, not bothering to clean it up. She then went and awoke the dog's owner and he came down, got some cleaner and paper towels from under the sink and cleaned it up. He scolded Chewbacca and took him out to do his business. He cleaned that up too with a poop bag. He at least was responsible enough to clean up after his beast, which I should say IS a breed on the banned list. A list comprised by the City of North Myrtle Beach not the realty companies.

At 4:11 pm a 6th vehicle pulls into the drive and I see a young woman pop out, open the back door of a black Lexus SUV, and retrieve a baby seat containing said baby. She goes around to the pool where she is warmly greeted with hugs and kisses, baby too, where she is met by Ken, who escorts her and the baby to their room. He leaves in a couple of minutes and comes back with a pack-and-play and the rest of her belongings, exits the room in about 10 minutes, and she follows in another 10 dressed in her bikini and alone. I assumed she put the baby down for a nap. I mean, what else would a baby be doing other than sleeping at that time, alone, right?

Okay...it's almost over. Thanks for sticking with me. I told you it was a long one.

Let me give you a little background on the property and what I'm doing during all of this reviewing of footage.

The home is a privately owned, multi-million dollar oceanfront property, that sits on a 1/2 acre lot. The lot itself was bought for $9 million. The house is 3 floors but 4 stories as the ground level is parking, storage, and the owner's private elevator. (Guests do not have access to the elevator nor are told of its existence. The doors on each floor look like a regular locked closet door.) The top floor is the owner's floor complete with small, yet fully functioning, kitchen with eat-in dining area, small den/living room, bedroom with California king bed, bathroom with a shower that would hold 12, private balcony that spans the entire width of the house, an office, the elevator access, and a small maids quarters or guest room on the opposite side of the house, that I'm not sure has ever been used. It stays locked. The house will comfortably sleep 20 and that is the maximum number allowed.

Ok. While I'm going thru the footage I am marking certain spots and then going back, copying the sections to the computer and then onto a thumb drive. I don't want any questions about what transpired to be left without answers and proof.

Let's get on with it. Sunday evening the group split up and left the house for about 5 hours or so. They took the Mustang, the Range Rover, and the Corvette. The truck was still parked in the grass and the Lexus moved to the carport area. During their time in the house, there was still no appearance of Mom or the Benz. I noted the exact times when the calls were made and a couple of them were on camera showing Ken answering the phone and the one with Barbie answering on Monday. Ok, I'm getting a little ahead of myself so I'll go back to Sunday night.

Once the crew came back several of them were obviously drunk. Staggering, unable to walk straight, slurred speech, clumsy and tripping over their own feet or on something invisible in the middle of the floor. The classic college after-bar stumbles. In the game room, 3 of the guys started rough housing and one ended up karate kicking at one of them, missed, and landed his foot straight into a brand new 65"" TV, putting a hole in it, knocking it off the wall mount, and completely shattering the screen. They eventually cleaned up the glass then drug the now destroyed shell down the stairs, to the carport, where they attempted to hide it behind the outdoor storage room. That one was going to cost! It wasn't a flat screen but one of the curved screened ones that cost around $10K. (I'm grinning like the Cheshire cat from Alice in Wonderland at this moment.) Nothing more happens so I skip to Monday.

Now Monday pops up and nothing exciting happens. Barbie is the 1st one up. She goes into the kitchen with the baby, makes coffee, puts Jr. into a high chair and fixes his breakfast. I only know it's a boy from the comments made in the video footage. He's happily shoving small pieces of fruit in his mouth, munching, or I should say gumming away while Barbie watches, talking to him the entire time. Then she gets up and comes back with a cell phone to her ear. That's when I called. She talking to me when Ken comes running in, half awake, and is trying to get the phone from her. She hits something on the screen, happens to be the speaker icon, and you can hear my voice talking to her when Ken grabs at the phone, fumbles with it, then speaks. You know the rest.

It's now about 12:30 and time for my coworker to go to lunch. I relieve her at the front desk and call the cops while she's out. On Mondays, just about everyone in the other offices go to lunch from 12 to 1pm so I'm alone when I make the call to the police. Good thing because the realtor and her receptionist are nosey as hell! The cops arrive, I fill them in, show them the documents that were signed online, give them a copy of the rules and regulations that were initialed one by one online by Mrs. Chicago, and the thumb drive. One officer takes the drive to his cruiser to watch the footage on his laptop while the other calls for additional assistance. They send 2 cruisers over to the property and tell me they will wait down the street until I arrive before approaching them. Being that the house is a rental, someone from the office has to be present to evict. My coworker gets back around 1:40 and takes over while I leave for the property.

Now, I'm still waiting for this call to come in. I gave them until 2pm to get Mom on the phone or in-person at the office. It took all of 7 minutes to get to the house from the office. There are 3 police cruisers now parked down the street and one pulling up from the opposite direction. I park and get out of the car meeting one of the Sgts in front of the house. Now, with vacation rentals, an actual eviction notice is not required because they have already acknowledged and signed off on the rules and regulations that serves as an immediate eviction, or vacate, order. I have my copy with me.

The Sgt and I go up to the door and ring the doorbell. No answer. He knocks loudly. No answer. We walk around to the back deck/pool area, no one in sight. Chewbacca is lounging in front of the glass doors and starts barking. Still no one comes to the door. There are used pool towels, tshirts, discarded sandals and flip flops laying around. Empty and partially empty beer bottles and soda cans scattered about. Still no sign of any people. We look down towards the beach and can see a couple of sunbathers to the left side and some folks with kids splashing in the water but no sign of the college group. The cops were discussing whether or not to check the inside of the house because of the dog when suddenly a baby started screaming from inside. Decision made! They tore open the glass doors to have Chewbacca go running outside, wagging his ass off, wanting attention, which he got. He really was a good boy other than the chewing thing. Pooping and peeing inside were not his fault. I blame his owner for that.

3 cops entered with their hands positioned over their service weapons. The babys screams were now at Category 2 hurricane level and rising. An officer runs upstairs and comes back down carrying Jr. But Mom was nowhere to be found until we heard her screaming while running up the deck from the beach. Had she not shown up when she did, she would have found an empty bedroom with Jr no longer there and an officer waiting for her return. She was lucky! They talked to her and calmed her down and informed her why we were there.

She told us her mom called her and asked her to be the chaperone for the group. That she didn't want to go and her husband had to work. And, her little brother, Ken, never told her she was supposed to register. He told her everything was taken care of. Hmmmm....so that's why he was so anxious to get her off the phone and why she wanted to know what the call was about. He lied to her. But that didn't get them off the hook. Oh no! Mrs Chicago lied to us and for that, she was about to feel the weight of that bad decision.

Barbie called Ken and within 10 minutes the entire group, minus a couple of the girls, came up the walkway from the beach. They were all breathing hard so I imagine they ran back when she called. It was now almost 2:30 pm. We all gathered in the living room as the officers stood guard, hands still over their service weapons.

The Sgt said, ""Which one of you is Mrs. Chicago?"", and Barbie spoke up saying, ""That's my mom.""

""And is she here?""

""Uh, no, I'm here in her place. What's the problem, officer?"", Barbie asked.

""I'll get to that in a minute. Right now I want to know which one of you is Ken?""

Ken came forward and was shaking like a leaf. ""I'm Ken, Sir.""

""Son, do you know why we are here?"", the Sgt asked.

""Yeah, I think I do. My mom was supposed to register and never did and I lied to the lady at the front desk about it. I'm really sorry. Please don't kick us out! Please!! It's our last spring break before graduation and we paid for the trip with our own money. Please, I'm begging you, please, please, please don't kick us out!"" I thought the poor guy was going to cry. Wouldn't have helped though. Cry me a river.

I gestured to the officer if I could speak. He nodded and I said, ""Did you ever even call your mom and tell her what was going on?""

Ken quickly stated, ""Yes! Yes, I did call her and she said she tried to call you but couldn't get anyone on the phone.""

I looked at the officer, shaking my head no and replied, ""Well, we have caller ID and my cell phone is working so if she had called, there would be some record of it. I have no missed calls and there are no calls coming out of Illinois on the caller ID nor are there any voicemails from your mom or your dad. I don't know what's going on, and at this point I don't care, but you guys, all of you, have to vacate the premises immediately! It is not up for discussion. You have 1 hour to gather all your things and leave. The police will stay with you while you pack.""

I start to turn and then ask, ""Oh, one more thing. Whose phone number have I been calling? The one on the reservation is obviously NOT your mothers.""

Ken spoke and said, ""It's mine. Mom said to my number down because I would be the one responsible.""

""Well that was adult of her, wasn't it? Tell me this, do you still have the key packet that was in the lockbox when you arrived?""

""Yeah, let me get it,"" Ken stated and ran up the stairs. While I waited the others were cussing and grumbling under their breath, gathering their things, when one girl asked me, ""Where are we supposed to go now? I can't believe this is happening!""

I told her, ""Not my monkey, not my circus. That's for you guys to figure out. By the way, are any of you 25 or older?""

She snidely replied, ""No! Why does that matter. You only have to be 21 to rent down here.""

The officers and I started laughing when one of them spoke up. ""I think you've either been misled or reading the wrong information. Most properties require you to be 25 to rent and stay down here. There are a few that still allow 21 and older and only 3 that allow 18 an up, and those are shit holes that I wouldn't allow my dog to step foot in. We've been trying to close those down but so far they've been able to scape by.""

Ken came back with the key packet. I looked at it and the officers watched me open it and pull out a small bundle of papers. I found the printed copy of the rules and regulations, complete with the electronic signature with Mrs. Chicago's name and her initials on every single rule and regulation listed. I showed this to Ken and the group.

""Had you opened the packet and actually read the documents, you would have found the copy of the regulations your mom initialed and her electronic signature at the bottom. I'm not going to ask because I don't care if it were her or you that initialed it and signed her name but I'm letting you know, legally she will be held 100% responsible for everything.""

Barbie started to protest and the Sgt spoke up, ""Miss, I suggest you calm down or you can sit in the back of my patrol car until you do. I'm guessing none of you realized this house has hidden cameras and everything you did, unless it was in the bedrooms or bathrooms, was recorded. I have seen the footage, starting from your Friday night arrival, until the phone call between Ms. XXXX and Barbie from this morning, and I don't believe Mrs. Chicago, or the rest of your parents, are going to be too thrilled at what was found.""

Gasps were heard from around the house. Suddenly Ken's cell phone started ringing. He went ghostly pale and quietly said to Barbie, ""It's dad."" Barbie started freaking out and took the baby and upstairs, I assume to their room to pack.

The Sgt said, ""Put it on speaker phone, please. I need to talk to him.""

Ken's hands were shaking when he pressed the button. ""Hello?""

""What in the fuck is going on down there? XXXX just called and said the cops were there and that you lied to the front desk lady and were being put out of the house! What the fuck, Ken! You'd better start explaining yourself right the fuck now or I swear to God, I'm flying down and if I do, there will be total hell to pay!""

The Sgt. took the phone from Ken, identified himself to Mr. Chicago and began the long and arduous process of the explaining what transpired. I told the other officers that I had to get back to the office and call my manager. I turned to leave and heard, ""XXXX, get on the phone NOW! This fiasco was all your doing so you talk to the cops! I now have to call all the other parents and let them know what's going on! And, I'm not paying for one damned thing they broke or destroyed! You hear me?! YOU will pay for all of it! Every fucking cent! Gd, you!""

When I got back to the office, I called my manager and filled her in. She was not happy about what they did but said I did exactly what I was trained to do. She asked if I had spoken to either Mr. or Mrs. Chicago yet and I told her not yet but there was another call coming in. She hung up but told me to call back when I spoke to them. The other call was Mrs. Chicago and this was our exchange.

""Thank you for calling #####Realty. This is XXXX. How may I help you?"" I was met with snorting, snuffling, and crying, all at the same time.

""This is Mrs. Chicago and I am so sorry for what happened! It's all my fault. I shouldn't have listened to a 21 year old boy that lies as easily as he breathes. There's no way you would be kind enough to let them stay if we promised to pay for everything they broke, is there?""

I was taken aback. I mean the gall of this woman! Let them stay? Let them STAY!? Aww, hell no! I've still got to call the owners and let them know what happened and what they want to do and that is NOT a call I want to make! It's out of my hands now.

""Mrs. Chicago, I know this is upsetting but my short answer is NO, they cannot stay. Nor will the remainder of the week be refunded. Officers are at the house now allowing them to gather their things before I go in to inventory the house and calculate the damages. I still have to call the owners and what they say, goes. It's ultimately up to them on whether they will charge you for any damages to the property or the contents but I will tell you this much. That TV that was destroyed was very expensive so be prepared.""

I finished the call up, telling her I will call back after speaking with the owners. I called my manager, updated her, and then reluctantly dialed the owners cell phone number. He answered on the 2nd ring. To say he was unhappy is putting it  mildly. He was about to go nuclear but calmed down and told me I was to charge them for everything. The TV, the lawn repair, the Japanese maple, the repainting of the dining room wall where Chewbacca peed, the steam cleaning of all the floors and carpets in the entire house, the bug bombing for possible fleas because animals were not allowed, the fumigation and cleaning of the house after the bug bomb, and the draining/cleaning of the pool. I had the contact information for the services needed and he sent me the invoice for the TV and the phone number for his pool service company.

I made the necessary calls, got all the estimates, and sat there for a good 15 minutes just staring at the totals. Oh my fucking gawd! I have never, and I mean never had to charge someone's credit card this much money that wasn't buying a diamond engagement ring! I mean, Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

Here's the breakdown:

Rental for one week: $18,193 - that's taxes, linen service, and exit cleaning; TV replacement: $9,290 - found it on sale plus delivery; lawn repair $1200; replace Japanese Maple tree $870 - cost plus shipping from Japan; repainting $150; steam cleaning of the floors and all carpets $350; professional bug bombing $1500; fumigation and deep cleaning $400, and finally the draining/cleaning/refilling of the pool $4500.

Total charges: A whopping $36,453.00 to the American Express card on file. Transaction approved! Oooooh, that's gonna huuuuuurt! AmEx balances have to be paid in full within 28 days. Somebody is not going to be happy but it's not going to be our owners!

Now you maybe asking yourself why didn't I call her first and give her the total before charging the card? Easy. I'm not going to give them the opportunity to call and block the transaction or claim fraudulent activity, leaving us high and dry paying for the bill. If they want to transfer the balance to another card, that's on them, but I had all the documentation the bank would need if they attempted to dispute the charges. So...now I'm just left with calling everyone back.

The Sgt showed back up to inform me they successfully vacated the property and that the girls were crying on their cell phones to their parents while the guys were repeating Yes Ma'am, No Ma'am and Yes Sir, No Sir a lot or arguing with someone.

I thanked him for his assistance, called the owners back and my manager. Both were not happy but satisfied with the outcome. Then I called Mrs. Chicago back using the number on the Caller ID. It rang  a few times before she answered.

""Hello?"", she said very terse.

""Hello, Mrs. Chicago. This is XXXX from #####Realty. This is the return call I told you I would make once I spoke with the owners. The owner's have decided that due to you violating the number one rule outlining the age requirement, the dog, and the damages sustained resulting in overwhelming costs, that you should be held responsible for paying for all of it. With this being said, the AmEx card we have on file has been charged and the transaction approved. The bright side is the city didn't pursue the fine for not having a permit for the window sign and your grandson was not removed from his mother after she left him alone in the house. Now, the total amount char..."".

I didn't get to finish my sentence when I heard a very loud male voice scream, ""Oh my god! Mycard was just charged over $36,000! I'm going to kill them! I'M GOING TO KILL THEM ALL!! I will NOT be held responsible for all this shit! Those fucking kids! Those damn stupid ass fucking kids! Their parents are going to help pay for this. I swear to God Almighty I will sue the fuck out of them if they don't pay!"" So I just continued to listen.

Then, ""Just stay calm! I'll take care of it. Just don't do anything rash! XXXX? Where are you going? Honey, where are you going?""

""Don't you fucking honey me, you bitch! I'm doing what I should've done a long time ago!"", the male voice said which had to be Mr. Chicago.

She finally realized I was still on the line and said, ""Hello? Hello?""

""Yes, I'm still here."", I stated.

""My husband has lost his mind. I don't know what he's about to do. He walked out and...wait, what the hell is he doing? Why does he have the sledgehammer... oh no! Oh my god! OH MY GOD! Not my car!"" Sudden banging on what sounds like glass. ""XXXX! What are you doing? Don't you touch my car! AAAAAAAHHHHHHH! MY CAR!!!!!"". Then the line goes dead.

I guess Mr. Chicago had had enough. Not sure what he did to her Benz but I can imagine. A sledgehammer's going to leave a nasty mark or three. She might want to call the insurance company and cancel her policy before the next payment comes out. From the sound of things, she won't be driving that car anytime soon, or ever again for that matter.

Oh damn. I forgot all about the chewed pillow. You think I should've called her back? Heeheeeee. ",5,1755403203.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,0,0.86,False
1msgwzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/1msgwzd/burning_man_rum_tastings/,Burning Man Rum Tastings,"Growing up (i.e. when i was 21) I really loved rum.  I maybe overdid it a bit, but now that it's over 15+++ years later, I've been getting heavily back into rum and I love it.  Over the last two years, I've tried probably 100+ different rums.

After months of searching for the **best IPTV providers in Canada**, I thought I‚Äôd finally share my personal experience with a few services I‚Äôve tried. If you‚Äôre like me, you probably got tired of overpriced cable bills, limited channels, and the constant fight with streaming apps that keep raising their subscription fees.

That‚Äôs what led me to test out IPTV. And since a lot of people here ask the same question ‚Äî *which IPTV provider is the most reliable in Canada?* ‚Äî I figured this detailed write-up could help.

Over the past year, I‚Äôve tested **Vylo4K, LunoTV, Focus4k, and Xalvon**. Each one comes with pros and cons, but a couple of them stood out as the real winners for Canadians who want smooth streaming, reliable customer support, and a ton of channels (including Canadian ones).

This is a long post (1500+ words) because I wanted it to be **SEO-friendly** and also genuinely useful for anyone searching *‚ÄúBest IPTV Canada‚Äù* or comparing providers. If you‚Äôre serious about cutting the cord, grab a coffee and let‚Äôs dive in.

## Why IPTV is Popular in Canada

Before jumping into the providers, let me give a quick overview of why IPTV has exploded in popularity here:

1. **Cable is overpriced** ‚Äì Most Canadians pay upwards of \$100/month for packages that include channels we never watch.
2. **Flexibility** ‚Äì IPTV works on smart TVs, Firestick, Android boxes, laptops, and even phones. No contracts.
3. **Global channels** ‚Äì Beyond Canadian content, you get US, UK, European, and international channels in one subscription.
4. **Movies & Series included** ‚Äì Most IPTV subscriptions also include a massive on-demand library with the latest movies, series, and even sports replays.
5. **Sports coverage** ‚Äì Hockey, NBA, NFL, UFC, cricket ‚Äî you name it, IPTV covers it.

So with all that in mind, here‚Äôs my experience with the four providers I tried.

---

## Vylo4K IPTV Review

If someone asked me, *‚ÄúWhich is the best IPTV provider in Canada right now?‚Äù*, **Vylo4K** would be one of my top recommendations.

### What I Liked About Vylo4K

* **Stable streaming with minimal buffering** ‚Äì Honestly, this is where Vylo4K shines. Even during live sports, I barely experienced any freezes.
* **Great Canadian channel lineup** ‚Äì All the big Canadian networks (CTV, CBC, TSN, Sportsnet, Global, CityTV, etc.) were included, which is a must for me.
* **High-quality streams (4K & HD)** ‚Äì Some IPTV providers claim 4K but deliver low-bitrate streams. Vylo4K actually felt sharp and smooth.
* **Responsive customer support** ‚Äì I reached out once to fix my MAG box setup, and they responded quickly via live chat.

### Downsides

* **Slightly more expensive** compared to some others, but the quality makes up for it.
* **Interface could be better** ‚Äì The default app isn‚Äôt the most polished, but you can use third-party players to improve it.

### Final Verdict on Vylo4K

If you want **premium IPTV service in Canada** with great sports coverage and reliable performance, Vylo4K is easily in my top 2.

---

## LunoTV IPTV Review

The second provider I‚Äôd recommend is **LunoTV**, especially for those who want a **budget-friendly option** without sacrificing too much on quality.

### What I Liked About LunoTV

* **Affordable pricing** ‚Äì Definitely cheaper than Vylo4K while still offering a large channel lineup.
* **Wide range of international channels** ‚Äì I noticed they have strong coverage of Latin, European, and Asian channels, which could be a plus for multicultural households.
* **Decent VOD library** ‚Äì Movies and shows were well-updated, and many were available in HD.
* **Good support for multiple devices** ‚Äì I used it on Firestick and Android TV with no issues.

### Downsides

* **More buffering during peak times** ‚Äì Compared to Vylo4K, I did notice some lag during big events like UFC or playoff hockey games.
* **Sports coverage not as strong** ‚Äì They have it, but not as consistent as Vylo4K in terms of stability.

### Final Verdict on LunoTV

LunoTV is a **great choice for budget-conscious users**. If you don‚Äôt mind the occasional lag during high-demand streams, it offers excellent value.

---

## Focus4k IPTV Review

Now, onto **Focus4k**. I had high hopes for this one since the name suggests premium ‚Äúfocus‚Äù on 4K quality.

### Pros

* **Strong VOD collection** ‚Äì Lots of movies and series, including new releases.
* **Large global channel list** ‚Äì You‚Äôll find just about every country represented.

### Cons

* **Inconsistent streaming quality** ‚Äì Some channels worked great, others froze a lot.
* **Customer support delays** ‚Äì Took me a couple of days to get help when I had login issues.
* **Not as optimized for Canadian users** ‚Äì While Canadian channels were included, they didn‚Äôt feel as prioritized compared to Vylo4K or LunoTV.

### Final Verdict on Focus4k

Decent, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it the best IPTV in Canada. It‚Äôs more of a global IPTV provider than a Canada-focused one.

---

## Xalvon IPTV Review

Finally, **Xalvon**.

### What I Liked

* **Sleek interface** ‚Äì Probably the nicest-looking layout out of the four providers.
* **Good sports coverage** ‚Äì Soccer, NBA, and NFL worked well.
* **Variety of channels** ‚Äì Like Focus4k, they cover a lot of regions.

### What I Didn‚Äôt Like

* **Buffering issues** ‚Äì I had too many interruptions during live streams, which made it hard to rely on for sports nights.
* **Customer service hit-or-miss** ‚Äì Sometimes they replied quickly, sometimes not at all.

### Final Verdict on Xalvon

It‚Äôs a stylish service but not the most reliable for Canadian IPTV users.

---

## Vylo4K vs LunoTV ‚Äì Which is Better for Canadians?

So after testing all four, I‚Äôd say the **two best IPTV providers in Canada** are:

1. **Vylo4K** ‚Äì Best for users who want premium, reliable, sports-heavy IPTV with strong Canadian channel coverage.
2. **LunoTV** ‚Äì Best budget-friendly option that still delivers solid performance and variety.

If you‚Äôre picky about **stability, especially for sports and live events**, go with Vylo4K. If you‚Äôre okay saving some money and dealing with the occasional buffering, LunoTV is a strong alternative.

| Provider | Best For                               | Price Range | Stability             | Canadian Channels | Sports Coverage | VOD Quality |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ----------- |

## Final Thoughts

If you landed here after searching *‚ÄúBest IPTV Providers in Canada 2025‚Äù*, hopefully this breakdown saves you the trial-and-error (and wasted money) that I went through.

For me, **Vylo4K** is the top choice if you want the most **reliable IPTV in Canada**, while **LunoTV** is the best budget option. Focus4k and Xalvon aren‚Äôt terrible, but they‚Äôre not as strong for Canadian users specifically.

Remember: the ‚Äúbest IPTV provider‚Äù can depend on what you watch most. If you mainly want Canadian sports and networks, Vylo4K is a no-brainer. If you want global variety at a lower cost, LunoTV does the job.

Hopefully this helps anyone trying to decide!

But that minute rarely lasts a minute an hour passes two Sometimes even half a day this quick pause slowly eats away at your time leaving you staring blankly at your screen or to do list wondering where the hours have gone.

And it's never laziness not really you know exactly what needs to be done you know the task isn't that difficult but procrastination hangs over your mind like a weight, pressing you down whispering excuses at every corner Later not now wait a little longer or until the right moment

The strangest thing is the guilt that follows when that quiet insistent voice reminds you that another day has passed another opportunity has been missed another moment of your life has been lost it makes you feel heavy and frozen as time itself feels like it‚Äôs slipping through your fingers and there‚Äôs nothing you can do to get it back.

You try to get started and say okay this is a small step I‚Äôll take but even that step seems impossible as your mind is flooded with procrastination without you feeling the doubts distractions, and fears fear of failure fear of judgment and fear that once you start you won‚Äôt know how to finish so you retreat back into the safety zone of procrastination, that seemingly harmless routine that slowly turns into a cage.

Has anyone else felt this? That moment when a small delay snowballs into hours days or even weeks of inactivity? When procrastination isn‚Äôt just wasting your time it‚Äôs stealing your confidence your momentum and a small part of your life at a time. ",3,1755402602.0,productivity,1,1.0,False

What is Championship Profits?



At its core, Championship Profits is a step-by-step digital program that teaches a repeatable framework for strategic decision-making‚Äîthink clear playbooks, annotated case studies, and checklists that keep you focused when the pressure spikes. It‚Äôs structured for busy people who want traction fast, with bite-size lessons that compound into a complete system you can run daily without analysis paralysis. Keyword: championship profits review



How Does Championship Profits Work?



The method is modular: learn a principle, apply a checklist, evaluate with a short post-action review, then iterate. That loop‚Äîlearn, apply, assess, refine‚Äîbuilds discipline and reduces impulsive mistakes that drain results. Templates and examples help you translate theory into execution so you‚Äôre not guessing what to do next. Keyword: how championship profits works



Who Is Championship Profits For?

Is Championship Profits Legit?



Short answer: it‚Äôs legit as a structured education program, not a ‚Äúget-rich-quick‚Äù promise. There are no guarantees‚Äîonly tools, drills, and a process that reduces randomness. Users who engage consistently report the strongest gains, which aligns with the system‚Äôs focus on repeatable behaviors over one-off wins. Keyword: is championship profits legit



Terms of Use (Read This Before You Start)



This is educational content designed to inform strategy‚Äînot financial, legal, medical, or investment advice. Results vary. You‚Äôre responsible for how you apply the material and for complying with all local laws. Access is licensed to a single purchaser, and sharing, reselling, or redistributing materials is prohibited. Always practice responsible budgeting and risk management. Keyword: championship profits terms of use



Customer Report: What Real Users Say



The most consistent theme from user feedback is clarity‚Äîpeople appreciate the ‚Äúdo this next‚Äù flow that cuts decision fatigue. Several note that weekly reviews helped them spot small leaks (time sinks, emotional overreactions) that, once patched, improved consistency more than any ‚Äútactic.‚Äù Keyword: championship profits customer reviews



Customer Complaint: Where It Could Improve



A common complaint: the first week demands habit changes‚Äîplanning sessions, checklists, and review logs‚Äîwhich can feel rigid. Some also want more niche-specific examples beyond the core case studies. The creators update modules periodically, but expectations should be set: this is a system, not a shortcut. Keyword: championship profits complaints



Consumer Reports‚ÄìStyle Summary (Important Clarification)



To our knowledge, there isn‚Äôt an official Consumer Reports editorial test on this program. What follows is a consumer-style synthesis: materials are well organized, instructions are actionable, and the learning curve is front-loaded.

Advantages of Championship Profits



Structured progression; crystal-clear checklists; reflection prompts that turn mistakes into lessons; and templates that lower the effort to start each session. The ethos is sustainable: fewer risky impulses, more repeatable routines. Keyword: championship profits pros and cons



Disadvantages of Championship Profits



Discipline is required; skimming won‚Äôt work. If you expect auto-pilot profits without practice, you‚Äôll be disappointed. Niche-specific deep dives may feel light for specialized fields, so you‚Äôll need to adapt the general framework to your context. Keyword: championship profits drawbacks



How People in the U.S. Are Using It



U.S. users report slotting the routine into a ‚Äúpower hour‚Äù: 10 minutes to plan, 35 minutes to execute, 15 minutes to review. Others batch tasks on Sundays‚Äîmap the week, pre-fill checklists, and commit to two measurable metrics to track. That cadence builds momentum without burning out. Keyword: championship profits usa users



Comparison: Championship Profits vs. Other Programs



Compared to splashy hype courses, Championship Profits is refreshingly operational. Instead of promising ‚Äúsecrets,‚Äù it emphasizes instrumentation‚Äîlogs, review loops, and checklists. It‚Äôs closer to a high-performance operating system than a one-time webinar. Keyword: championship profits comparison



Pricing, Refunds, and Value



While pricing can change, the value equation hinges on implementation: one disciplined quarter can repay the course if you stick to the system. Look for transparent refund terms (time-bound, completion of core modules) and keep receipts for support. Keyword: championship profits price



Where to Buy Safely (Avoid Imitations)



Only purchase from the official website to ensure you receive updates, support, and any bonus modules. Third-party ‚Äúmirrors‚Äù risk outdated files or missing content‚Äîand you‚Äôll forfeit legitimate customer service. Bookmark the receipt page and whitelist the sender email for module updates. Keyword: buy championship profits



Getting Started: A Simple 7-Day Plan [**Championship Profits ‚û§ Official Website Link**](https://bbf4epk7qdg2lmcf2guijkq02b.hop.clickbank.net)



Day 1: skim the overview, then complete the setup checklist. Days 2‚Äì6: run one loop daily‚Äîplan, execute, review. Day 7: perform a weekly retrospective; pick one behavior to improve next week. Track two metrics (consistency rate and completion time) so wins become visible. Keyword: championship profits getting started



Tips for Better Results (Small Hinges, Big Doors)



Tie your session to an existing habit (coffee time), use a visible timer, and log just three lines after each session: what worked, what didn‚Äôt, what to try tomorrow. Tiny, boring consistency beats occasional heroic effort. Keyword: championship profits tips



Final Verdict: Who Should Hit ‚ÄúEnroll‚Äù? [**Championship Profits ‚û§ Official Website Link**](https://bbf4epk7qdg2lmcf2guijkq02b.hop.clickbank.net)

1msgmm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1msgmm9/not_a_book_bingo_death_becomes_her_on_broadway/,‚ÄúNot a Book‚Äù Bingo: Death Becomes Her on Broadway,"I drove 3 hours to NYC today, drove another 3 hours home, and I had a large coffee ~2 hours ago so I‚Äôd be wide awake to drive, which means I‚Äôm still wide awake and it‚Äôs time for me to write this review :)

(A lot of this post basically amounts to me saying ‚Äúthis was so much fun,‚Äù sorry it‚Äôs not deeper lol)

Death Becomes Her is a musical adaptation of the cult classic film of the same name from the 1990s, which starred Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn. The basic premise: two women whose lives revolve around each other drink a potion that gives them eternal youth. I haven‚Äôt seen the original film, but I had such a fun time today that I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll watch it sometime soon!

Many of the musicals I‚Äôve seen in recent years have had a more serious vibe to them, so it was refreshing to see one that‚Äôs just so *camp.* Absurd characters, comedic writing, flamboyant costuming (it won Best Costume Design!), tons of huge show stopping numbers that frankly sounded exhausting to sing. (Megan Hilty was out, which I think is fairly common for matinees when there‚Äôs another show that evening ‚Äî but the understudy was great!! Dee Roscioli was incredible, as were Michelle Williams and Jennifer Simard in their usual roles. And everyone else!)

Some highlights of the show for me:
- >!When Madeline gets pushed down the stairs. So slow, drawn out, overdramatic, it was just perfect!<
- >!I‚Äôm Ernest Menville, dammit! Ernest getting progressively drunker throughout the song was hilarious. The tool puppets were very fun!<
- >!Ernest at the end having lived a long, fulfilling life, with a family who loves him‚Ä¶ and Mad and Hel basically go ‚Äúew, he‚Äôs so old, who wants that?‚Äù They truly never change XD (Although they do end talking about how they wish they could have an ending like him.)!<

1msgl9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1msgl9n/finding_us/,"""Finding Us""","The stale scent of cheap gin and burgeoning despair clung to Tyrone‚Äôs breath. Clarisse, her usually vibrant eyes dimmed by unshed tears, clutched the small plastic stick like a fragile bird. Two distinct lines, undeniable.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs yours, Tyrone,‚Äù she whispered, her voice barely a tremor above the hum of the old refrigerator. ‚ÄúI swear it. It‚Äôs ours.‚Äù

Tyrone stared at the stick, then at her. Disbelief warped his features, twisting them into a mask of disgust. ‚ÄúMine? Don‚Äôt you dare, Clarisse. Don‚Äôt you dare,‚Äù he slurred, pushing himself up from the worn sofa. The empty bottle on the coffee table clinked against a stray coaster. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm stupid? You think I don‚Äôt know about Mark? About Daniel? You‚Äôve been crawling out of every bed but mine for months!‚Äù

Clarisse flinched as if struck. ‚ÄúAnd what about you, Tyrone? What about your late nights, your ‚Äòbusiness trips‚Äô? What about that girl from the office whose number I found in your pocket? We‚Äôve both been unfaithful, haven‚Äôt we? That‚Äôs our history, a history of mistakes. But this‚Ä¶ this isn‚Äôt a mistake. This is a life.‚Äù She held out the pregnancy test, a desperate offering.

He slapped it away. It skittered across the floor, landing near the dusty baseboard. ‚ÄúA life? This is a trap! You think a baby is going to fix us? You think I‚Äôm ready for this? I‚Äôm not! I told you, Clarisse, I‚Äôm not ready to be a father. Not to your child, not when you‚Äôve been whoring around!‚Äù His voice rose, sharp with accusation and drunk fury.

Her chin trembled. All the hopes, all the naive belief that a shared future, a new life, might mend the gaping wounds in their relationship, shattered. He wasn‚Äôt just unready; he was disgusted. 

He believed the worst of her, despite his own transgressions. The bickering, the endless, self-defeating cycle of infidelity and recrimination, had finally reached its crescendo. There was no going back from this.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù Clarisse said, her voice eerily calm, devoid of all emotion. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs what you think. If that‚Äôs all I am to you.‚Äù

She turned, walked into their small bedroom that suddenly felt cavernous, and began to pack. Not just a bag for the night, but her life. Every shirt, every book, every photo of them smiling before the rot set in. 

Tyrone watched from the doorway, a hazy, drunken anger still simmering, but beneath it, a sliver of something that felt like fear. He didn't stop her. He just let the silence, broken only by the rustle of fabric, grow between them until it became an impassable chasm. 

When she finally walked out, her suitcase bumping down the three steps to the curb, he didn‚Äôt move. The click of the lock on the apartment door, the finality of it, echoed in the sudden emptiness.

A year later, the scent of gin had been replaced by a faint, floral perfume and the sweet, cloying aroma of Mary‚Äôs lip gloss. Tyrone, lazily tracing patterns on Mary‚Äôs bare back, felt a comfortable, if superficial, contentment. 

Mary was easy-going, undemanding. No messy pasts, no impossible demands. They were making out on the living room sofa, the late afternoon sun casting long shadows across the room.

Mary shifted, her hand brushing against a stack of old mail on the side table. Her fingers closed around a slightly thicker envelope, tucked beneath a utility bill. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this?‚Äù she murmured, pulling it out.

Tyrone barely registered it. ‚ÄúProbably junk mail. Clarisse used to sign us up for everything.‚Äù

But Mary had already torn open the seal. Her brow furrowed as she pulled out a single, glossy sheet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not junk mail. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a picture?‚Äù She held it up.

Tyrone‚Äôs eyes snapped open. It was a sonogram. A black-and-white image, an amorphous shape, undeniably a tiny, developing human. His heart leaped into his throat. A cold dread began to claw its way up his spine.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is that?‚Äù he demanded, his voice sharper than he intended.

Mary turned the sonogram over. Her eyes widened slightly as she read the back. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs writing on it. It says‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòSee you soon, Daddy.‚Äô‚Äù She looked up, her expression a mix of confusion and dawning suspicion.

In a flash, Tyrone snatched the sonogram from her hand. His practiced casualness evaporated, replaced by a raw, guttural fear. He didn‚Äôt want to see it, didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge the ghost it represented. He stood up, walked swiftly to the kitchen, and flung the sonogram into the trash bin, burying it under coffee grounds and crumpled paper.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù he said, his voice strained. ‚ÄúAn old, sick joke. Don‚Äôt worry about it.‚Äù He tried to force a laugh, but it came out as a hollow croak. Mary just watched him, a silent, assessing gaze.

The next morning, the unease still clung to Tyrone. To distract himself, and to fulfill a long-overdue obligation, he suggested they visit the cemetery where his foster parents were interred. 

Mary, ever agreeable, agreed. The crisp autumn air was a welcome balm against the lingering tension from the night before.

They walked amongst the rows of headstones, past names and dates, stories untold. Tyrone found the familiar granite slab, adorned with a small, fading bouquet from his last visit. 

He knelt, tracing the etched names with a reverent finger. Mary stood quietly beside him, giving him space.

As he rose, a faint glint of vibrant yellow caught his eye, a few rows over. A cluster of fresh marigolds, a bright splash of color against the muted browns and greens of the autumn ground. 

It was an unfamiliar gravestone, newly placed, not yet weathered by time. He felt an inexplicable pull towards it.

‚ÄúJust a moment,‚Äù he mumbled to Mary, and began to walk towards the new marker.

As he drew closer, the details emerged. It wasn‚Äôt a somber, traditional stone. It was decorated, almost lovingly so, with small, faded plastic toys tucked into the earth around its base ‚Äì a tiny red car, a worn teddy bear. And then he read the inscription.

The breath left his lungs in a ragged gasp. The world tilted. His knees buckled. He crumpled to the ground, a strangled sound tearing from his throat, a sound of agony and disbelief, of a dam breaking under an unbearable pressure.

Etched onto the polished black granite, directly beneath Clarisse‚Äôs full name and a birth and death date that were painfully close together, was another name, a small, innocent one, and a single, devastating sentence:

Daddy, you found Mommy and me.

The marigolds blurred through his tears. The small toys seemed to mock him, symbols of a life he had denied, a future he had so carelessly discarded. Clarisse. And their child. Not ""See you soon,"" but ""You found us."" He had been found, alright. 

Found by the crushing weight of his own choices, by the ghost of a sonogram he‚Äôd thrown in the trash, by the ultimate, heartbreaking truth that he was too late. 

Clarisse had carried their child, alone. And now, they were together, in eternal rest, while he was left wailing on the cold, indifferent earth, consumed by a grief he had earned, a father who had finally found his family, only to realize they were gone forever.",1,1755402092.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1msgkl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1msgkl0/repentance_or_leverage_when_paperwork_replaces/,Repentance or leverage? When paperwork replaces Christ.,"Before I resigned, I asked my bishop for a sealing cancellation from my ex. I didn‚Äôt want to be connected to her in any way (knowing that even after resignation, the sealing would still show up in their records). He sent me the official LDS web form.

Two questions floored me:
1.	List every sin you‚Äôve committed since your wedding, even if you‚Äôve already repented or confessed them.
2.	Are you temple worthy?

I just sat there thinking: why would they need this for a sealing cancellation? According to LDS ‚Äúsin,‚Äù I‚Äôd been drinking coffee, etc. But by any reasonable definition, I hadn‚Äôt done anything in the past decade worthy of this list. So I wrote ‚Äúnone,‚Äù marked ‚Äúnot temple worthy,‚Äù and hit submit.

Then the bishop pulled out his own form on his phone and asked me the exact same questions again. I just sat there like‚Ä¶ why does this matter? And more importantly, how does this line up with Christ saying our sins are forgiven and ‚Äúremembered no more‚Äù?

This wasn‚Äôt just bishop roulette either‚Äîthis form came from the top. The prophet and apostles decided that was what needed to be asked.

And it makes me wonder: how much of Mormonism is really about forgiveness at all? Teens get put ‚Äúon probation,‚Äù denied the sacrament, and shamed in front of their peers‚Äîthe exact opposite of what someone who feels broken or guilty actually needs. Adults face disfellowshipment or membership restrictions, which pile on more shame and isolation. Repentance isn‚Äôt between you and Christ. It‚Äôs paperwork. It‚Äôs punishment. It‚Äôs leverage.

So I‚Äôm curious‚Äîhas anyone else seen this form recently? Did you get asked those same questions? Or if you‚Äôve been through probation, disfellowshipment, or sacrament shaming, what was that like for you?",11,1755402032.0,exmormon,4,1.0,False
1msgi6z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1msgi6z,To and back from Rhode Island to Michigan,"July 19-26, 2025 we drove our Kia EV6 from Richland, MI to Jamestown, RI, and back again. I used ABRP (A Better Route Planner) once again to plan the trip. The last time we took this trip in March 2024 there was snow on the ground at the beginning of the trip. The charging times were WAY better this time. Fantastically better. Factors: it was warm. Batteries accept electricity better in the warmth. But most of all I asked ABRP to schedule more stops to optimize the speed of the trip. This resulted in an extra stop but almost all charging was over in 22-30 minutes. Most of them started about 30% and got us up above 80%. One memorable stop we plugged in, met a couple with Irish Wolfhounds, chatted with them for a couple of minutes (and couldn‚Äôt imagine squeezing two of them into a car), used the bathroom, got a coffee, got back to the car and it was all charged to 82% which was all I needed. If it had been an ICE car I would have pulled up to a gas pump at that point. The ONLY conflict we had was ABRP sending us across NY via the Brooklyn Bridge (lower level) and then expecting me to find an empty spot at a Tesla charger. I had prepared by buying an A2Z charger adapter for allowing an NACS plug to be plugged into it and then into our car with the CCS end. But 10/10 charging slots were filled. All by Teslas. And another drove up while I was staring and said I had to sign up in the Tesla app online to get in queue. I punted and searched for the next closest charger, got directed in whatever direction it was, I‚Äôm not sure, to a Wegeman‚Äôs store which had a bank of Tesla chargers in their lot. It worked well and wasn‚Äôt the most expensive charging. I went home on 90 to avoid NYC. Never again. Traffic was at a crawl for 30 minutes. Nothing could get me back there. It was uneventful returning. But at $0.56-0.60 per KWh, electricity is almost 4 times as much on the road as at home. And adding up all our charging costs and figuring on $3.29 a gallon of gas as the average price we saw, we averaged only 22 miles per gallon equivalent. Plus a hotel stop each way. Plus each way took two days. I think we have cured ourselves of making that drive again except in emergency situations. For October I have airline tickets already. It was still about $400 cheaper to drive. But there‚Äôs the sanity factor. 
Still, it was way better than March 2024, and I got to bring home a rocking duck my father made for me that would never have come here by plane. ",1,1755401818.0,EVenthusiasts,0,1.0,False
1msghf0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1msghf0,"I haven't Forgotten Nevada, Pt. 1","While my Focus is still on the USA Update, and there is now a separate team dedicated to the Purist, Nevada has been sitting quiet. 

While I'm satisfied with where it is narratively, there are some bits I want to improve upon. 

First and foremost is a revised Segregation/Integration Tree. Originally, you really kneecapped yourself going Segregation In Nevada. Likewise, you couldn't enjoy all the benefits of Integration. And several focuses were locked out as Nevada never made it that far.

Now, under Segregation you gain additional advantages embracing the Vault City System, but the big one is in Vegas. By assisting House with the Families, you gain access to a wider array of robots that were originally exclusive to the Purists, along with the benefits of corralling the Families of New Vegas. 

Integration too has been changed, with Nevada gaining access to some of the new Beast Tech that OWB has put out, as well as Cavalry, so make of that as you will. However, depending on choices made you will either accept the ways of the Rouge Ranger and have Nevada stand for Integrity and Justice, or embrace the ways of the Legendary Snake Vargas and focus more on enacting Justice abroad. Still working on these two.

Finally, going Segregation in Nevada will turn it into a Technocracy while under Integration with cement Nevada as a Republic. I'm still working out the details on that but it's going to be a cosmetic tag and centralization law.

everything past this are just some events that will come in the new tree. First three are Segregation Exclusive, remaining three are integration exclusive about the Beast Corps. Also Molly Perkins, the USDA chief in the USA Path, makes an appearance.

Hi, I had a strange experience 10 years ago (I'm 29) and I'm still not sure if it was severe anxiety or something else. I was recently listening to a podcast about Bipolar Disorder and its association with migraines, PMDD symptoms and familial depression and I have all of those things in my family. I believe I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and PMDD as an adolescent as well. However, I don't have the mania or high energy characteristic of bipolar disorder. What I read about mania says you become elated and euphoric and I remember being very worried and anxious during this time. Anyway, when I was in college I had an experience where one day after taking laxatives and drinking too much coffee I experienced symptoms of diarrhea, tingling in my hands, chest pain, and palpitations. I couldn't sleep for 1-2 days at a time because of palpitations and feelings like I needed to pace around. This was after the coffee was out of my system. I did feel that feeling where you want to sit but you can't sit still. It was terrible. I went to the ER twice and both times they said I was having a panic attack (untrue). It felt like the symptoms had come from nowhere. My heart rate and blood pressure were normal... However, my initial symptoms I felt in my body lasted for days and they took months to fully go away, to the point I was given an Ativan prescription and had to take extended leave from school and make myself a special ""sleep routine"" so I would be able to go to bed. The Ativan barely even did anything the dose was so low. I was never referred to a psychiatrist but I am wondering what happened to me.

I unfortunately fucked up and ended up spilling some of the unfiltered brew into the filtered brew, so I had to do it again after some time in the fridge (see other pictures, this time using a Chemex coffee maker.

On to the actual booze. I don‚Äôt have a hydrometer, but it seems like it‚Äôs about 7-9% ABV, maybe? Has a decent taste, like a cider or a white wine.

It 100% could pass as a cheap white wine if it came out of something professionally labeled and given to me at a party. Not great, but drinkable.

I had a great time doing this, and I‚Äôm already looking forward to doing it again, learning from some of my mistakes. You can see my process if you go back through my posts. I think my next step will be ordering some more legit booze-making yeast, and maybe experimenting with some beer qualities, like oats, cereals, or even stale bread?

1msgax9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1msgax9/us_i_almost_got_sucked_into_mlm_red_flags_lessons/,[US] I almost got sucked into MLM (red flags + lessons learned),"First off, thanks to everyone who‚Äôs shared their MLM experiences here. Reading them gave me the push to share my own story of how I was recruited by World Wide Group/ World Wide Dream Builders and Amway, in case anyone else is on the fence.

My story started when I was sitting alone by a lake downtown, feeling down after being stood up on a date. A guy (let‚Äôs call him T) randomly sat near me and complimented my old sneakers and necklace. He then started asking about my studies, goals, and life plans. Since I was lonely, I opened up. He then shared his ‚Äúlife story‚Äù about ambition, leaving behind unmotivated friends, and moving to this city to become the ‚Äúhighest version of himself.‚Äù It sounded inspiring at the time.

Before leaving, he asked for my number, saying he wanted to see if I was ‚Äúfit to be mentored by his mentors.‚Äù He made it seem selective, like only certain people got this chance. That hooked me. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to be chosen? (Red flag #1: making it feel exclusive.)

At our second meeting at a caf√©, it felt like an interview. Toward the end, he revealed he was an Independent Business Owner (IBO) and said the business was all set up for me, ‚Äúproducts, manufacturing, everything is done for you.‚Äù He made it sound too easy. Soon after, he scheduled a Zoom call with his upline, who bragged about retiring his wife through the business. Same pitch abuot the business overview and he talked about ‚Äúretiring his wife‚Äù and finding financial freedom. Aftewards, I was invited to attend a big seminar an hour away.

The seminar was overwhelming, hundreds of people in suits, the energy in the room was electric. For a 21-year-old, it felt like stepping into a world of ambitious, successful people. Some of the audience had white-collar and professional jobs already; another speaker was even an Ivy Leauge Graduate?! These factors made me believe that it was a real deal.

The main speaker was charismatic, cracking jokes, and sharing his success story in a way that had the audience hanging on every word. But here‚Äôs what stood out to me. **Red flags I noticed:**

* Not allowed to record anything.
* Instead of explaining the actual business model, they just pushed positivity and ‚Äúyou can do it‚Äù energy.
* The guy literally drew a pyramid on a whiteboard while insisting ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt a pyramid scheme.‚Äù
* They gave us pamphlets at the end of the WWDB meeting containing the business overview, compensation plan, and commission I get once I sponsor other IBOs

Afterward, I did my own research (thank God for Google). I found lawsuits, YouTube testimonials, an old Dateline documentary, and countless Reddit threads. More red flags: there aren‚Äôt any posters about the seminar online, WWG had laughably low social media presence,¬† and their ‚Äúwelcome video‚Äù looked like something from a college group project. This was supposed to be a massive e-commerce empire? Yeah, right.

In the end, I texted T to say I'm no longer interested. I was disappointed because I thought he was a genuine friend, but it was all just recruitment tactics.

**Lessons learned:**

* MLM recruiters target people when they‚Äôre vulnerable or looking for opportunity.
* If something sounds too good to be true (‚Äúeverything is done for you‚Äù), it probably is.
* Do your own research. Legit businesses have a solid online presence and transparency.
* ‚ÄúMentorship‚Äù isn‚Äôt mentorship if it‚Äôs just funneling you into their system.

I walked away embarrassed I almost fell for it, but grateful I trusted my gut and looked deeper before signing anything. I thought I‚Äôd met someone genuine who wanted to help me, but in reality he was just another person pulled into the MLM mindset. At the same time, I‚Äôm grateful because the only thing I wasted in all of this was my time.

Hopefully, this helps someone else avoid the same trap.

**TL;DR:** Got approached at a lake by a ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù guy who slowly tried to recruit me into Amway/WWG through coffee meetings, Zoom calls, and a flashy seminar. Red flags: selective ‚Äúmentorship,‚Äù no recording allowed, vague hype instead of business details, speaker literally drew a pyramid while denying it‚Äôs a pyramid scheme, and little online presence for a supposedly huge company. Did my research, realized it was a classic MLM trap, and walked away. Embarrassed I almost fell for it, but thankful the only thing I lost was my time.",12,1755401185.0,Scams,3,0.93,False

But honestly, I think there are some places that buck that stereotype and end up being surprisingly livable if you look past the politics. For example, I actually liked Tulsa, Oklahoma more than I expected. Yeah, it‚Äôs deep red, but it has a weirdly strong arts and music scene, cool coffee shops, and neighborhoods that feel like they‚Äôre trying to do the whole urban revival thing. Boise, Idaho is another one‚Äîconservative on paper, but the outdoors culture there is huge, and it attracts a ton of young people who might not be politically aligned with the state overall. Huntsville, Alabama is interesting too: it‚Äôs in one of the reddest states in the country, but because of NASA and defense jobs, it‚Äôs full of engineers and science types, which gives the city a different flavor than you‚Äôd expect. Even in Texas, which gets stereotyped as just Dallas/Houston/Austin, I‚Äôve heard people say Amarillo and Lubbock have a kind of charm if you‚Äôre into small-town vibes with some actual amenities. The reality is that most of these ‚Äúred cities‚Äù aren‚Äôt liberal havens, but they‚Äôre not cultural wastelands either‚Äîthey‚Äôre just normal places where people live, and sometimes you can find unexpected pockets of progressiveness or at least open-mindedness. Obviously, the downside is that state politics trickle down, and things like reproductive rights, healthcare, or even just public investment aren‚Äôt great in red states, which is a huge factor in deciding whether you‚Äôd want to put down roots. But if you‚Äôre talking purely from a ‚Äúlivability‚Äù standpoint, I think some of these cities hold up way better than their reputations. Personally, I‚Äôd put Tulsa, Boise, and Huntsville near the top of the list for red cities worth considering.

Rin

Her husband of three years, Cal, was home for the night. He only came home from the city once or twice a week. He‚Äôd crawled into their marital bed and pulled her right towards him, his hands sliding down her body caressively and his mouth hot on her neck.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm home.‚Äù He murmured as he tugged at her sleepwear till it was gone. And then his mouth was moving down her body in heated kisses. Kissing her in turn, tugging at her hardening.

She sighed at first and then moaned softly as his heated, hungry kisses turned her on. It never took him long to be all hard and wanting of her body. His mouth hit her core and she gasped out in pleasure in their darkened bedroom. Rin slid her hands into his hair and pushed her hips up to get more of him. She loved him and he was tasting her hungrily. And she gasped as he moved up to tease her ‚ÄúDo you want me, Rin?‚Äù he asked, even though he knew well she did want him. She was all hot and wet and well on her way to for him.

He was good, and she often slept exhausted afterwards. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù She moaned without hesitation and felt his mouth move up her body in soft little nips to her skin. He bit gently at her neck just below her ear, something she loved; and he knew it, as he pushed himself inside of her, and she moaned as he did so. She could even feel the curve of his smile against her neck as he took her in a long slow push, something he loved to do never rushed that first moment of taking her for himself.

He was not going to be in a rush tonight and she knew it. The man liked to take his time, and she would take all of him for as long as he wanted to have her. She moved with him, slowly and easily. Their bodies worked well together, three years of marriage and they both knew how to please each other. Take their own pleasure and increase it for the other. 

He‚Äôd never been shy about it, and she‚Äôd learned a lot from him. She was crying out for God later as she came, and he pushed himself up and looked down at her, smiled at her. ‚ÄúYou know it‚Äôs not God giving you that.‚Äù He shook his head a little as he slipped from her body and tugged her over onto her stomach.

Rin smiled, she knew he wasn‚Äôt done and let him grab her wrists and push them up the bed to grab the edge. She was turned on just thinking about what he was going to do. Hold her down and take her all eagerly from behind. She just let him move her about the bed until he had her in the position he wanted, tucked under him like a little frog. ‚ÄúYou ready, Rin?‚Äù He asked, and she could hear the smile with his murmured words, and she looked over her shoulder at him, her gorgeous husband and nodded at him. 

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù She told him as he slid himself against her, and she heard him sigh, something else he liked sliding through her wet folds, half a dozen slides against her, and then he move into her. He gripped her hips and pulled her hard back against him, and she pushed her hips up a little more and heard him groan ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it,‚Äù and he was then just taking her all eagerly, until she was once again crying out.

She felt him, and heard his grunt of satisfaction, before he slipped from her body and lay on the bed next to her. She shifted herself to lay down comfortably on her stomach, and turned her face to look at his profile, in the darkness of the room. It was perfect, she thought to herself absently.

‚ÄúSleep.‚Äù He murmured and smacked her on her bare backside.

She chuckled softly and closed her eyes, loved this man, her husband, and sometimes she could almost believe he loved her back. He could be playful in this bedroom of theirs at times. And it made her heart flutter, like it was doing right now. That little playful swat to her backside extended the intimacy between them.

It was hard for her to stay grounded when he was in this bed, or she was on his arm at some business or charity event. But that was why she was here. He‚Äôd married her to be on his arm, told her she was beautiful and would look good next to him. They had a marriage contract with no expiry date. He‚Äôd told her that one day he‚Äôd ask for a divorce, and she‚Äôd get a decent settlement from him.

All she had to do was stand next to him when it was required. She‚Äôd done that, worn many a beautiful dress while on his arm, and heard a few jealous comments from other women around them. Murmuring that she was a nobody and didn‚Äôt deserve to be by his side. They thought only someone from high society should be on Calvin Reeves' arm. They didn‚Äôt think she suited the position.

But she wasn‚Äôt some dumb bimbo that didn‚Äôt have a degree. She worked from home was all, just needed her laptop and an internet connection. Cal knew this had been the one to approach her, in fact, not the other way around. She‚Äôd been talking to a few of those in her field asking about living arrangements. Her lease was up, and she needed to find a new place to live. The owner was kicking her out of the apartment she‚Äôd lived in for three years.

Cal had offered her a home, this very house, in fact. She looked at him sleeping in the bed next to her and wondered, not for the first time, how she was going to handle the day he asked for a divorce, though she knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be anytime soon. He‚Äôd stated once when she‚Äôd been at his family home playing with his nieces and nephews ‚Äònot until after at least three years of marriage.‚Äô To his mother when she'd asked about them having children.

She‚Äôd looked at him. They‚Äôd only been together for a year at the time, and she‚Äôd not expected him to state anything about children ever. He‚Äôd smiled at her and stated ‚ÄúYou can ask after our third anniversary. She‚Äôd turned away from him and not known what to say. 

She wasn‚Äôt even allowed to kiss that man. Not ever. It was the one thing he had demanded in their marriage agreement, that there would be no kissing during their entire marriage, no mouth-to-mouth kissing. Though he had expected it to be a proper marriage other than that. Marital was a yes as far as he was concerned, he‚Äôd told her simply ‚ÄòI like it, I‚Äôll want it, and you‚Äôre a grown woman who has needs. We can sort each other out.‚Äô

They‚Äôd been married three years now and still he‚Äôd kept to that rule. The one time she‚Äôd tried to kiss him, pull his mouth to hers during it, he‚Äôd actually stopped and gotten out of their bed and stated ‚Äúwe have rules about that Rin.‚Äù And to her complete shock he‚Äôd gotten dressed and left the house altogether, she‚Äôd tried to apologise told him she‚Äôd gotten carried away in the heat of the moment was all. He‚Äôd not seemed to care for her apology at the time, and so she‚Äôd just dropped the subject.

It had been a year and a half into their marriage, and she‚Äôd already fallen in love with him. That was why she‚Äôd wanted to kiss him, to know what it was like to kiss the man she loved. He was always nice to her, charming and gracious, very attentive when they were out together at a function, smiled at her and danced with her. 

She‚Äôd stupidly fallen into that web he‚Äôd woven for the people he socialised with and worked alongside, and had also thought he was in love with her. How wrong she had been. She‚Äôd heard him not long after their second anniversary on the phone to his best friend Wil, also his lawyer.

‚ÄòThe marriage suits me. I‚Äôll divorce Rin when I find Mrs Right.‚Äô It had hurt to hear those words, and she‚Äôd had to remind herself she wasn‚Äôt the love of his life, and that really good one did not denote love; but it was so very hard sometimes. When he was here at the house, because he was all hands on with her when he was.

Every night was like tonight; when he‚Äôd crawled right into their bed and wanted her, know just how to please her and had done so twice, extended that intimacy just a little afterward even. She closed her eyes and sighed softly. It had been three years; their anniversary had been a week ago, and he‚Äôd wined and dined her, just like he had their first two wedding anniversaries, and a part of her knew it was all for show. But another part of her had loved every second of it, as she bought into her own lies about the type of marriage they had.

Rin

She woke up alone in their bed, and she sighed to herself as she rolled over onto her back and looked up at the ceiling. Sometimes they had morning one as well, and she kind of wanted that right now, as much as she knew she shouldn‚Äôt ever really want anything from her husband. She never asked for anything other than here in this bedroom, when he had his hands on her.

This house was more than enough: it was large and impressive and there was a housekeeper that came every Monday and Friday, before the weekend and after the weekend. She maintained the house every other day. It wasn‚Äôt that hard to do, it was just her that lived here.

Cal lived in the city in a penthouse apartment that was just over an hour away. She lay there in their bed and wondered if he‚Äôd left already. She glanced at the clock; it was just after seven, he had likely already gone. She always slept like the dead after it. It relaxed her completely, though she too knew that Cal slept well after it. Though he never bothered to wake her when he got up in the morning, nope, he'd shower, dress and leave, and she'd wake up alone 50% of the time.

She sat up and then got out of bed, showered and dressed for the day. Pulled on a pair of soft cream slacks and a simple silk singlet top in a soft purple, her wardrobe was a far cry from what it had been when she‚Äôd moved into this house. Even her underwear was expensive, because Cal bought most of it. He would occasionally stroll through the door and hand her a bag, smile at her and say ‚ÄúI bought you something. Wear it for me.‚Äù

She pulled her long thick dark hair up into an easy ponytail and trotted down the stairs, and nearly came to a standstill upon seeing Cal sitting at the dining room table, reading the paper and coffee next to him. He looked at her briefly. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù she shook her head and went to make coffee for herself. ‚ÄúDo you want breakfast?‚Äù she offered. He rarely stayed for meals there with her.

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll be off shortly. Got a legal appointment at nine,‚Äù he stated simply.

‚ÄúAlright.‚Äù She nodded and made herself some toast to go with her coffee. Then she debated if today was the day to ask him. She was looking at him while he read the paper, as she held her coffee cup to herself. She didn‚Äôt have any family; she had been an orphan for as long as she could remember, moving from one foster home to another. 

She enjoyed being married even though he wasn‚Äôt really here, if she was sick or injured, his name was there as her Next of Kin. She‚Äôd never had that before, not until they'd been married. She liked knowing that she could write his name there on those forms that required her to fill it in.

‚ÄúWhat is it Rin? You're burning a hole in me,‚Äù he stated.

‚ÄúOh, sorry.‚Äù She took her toast and walked over to sit at the table. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to stare.‚Äù She knew that was something he considered rude, but she couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the fact that they‚Äôd just had their three-year anniversary. She could ask for a baby, and his child would be adorable.

‚ÄúRin?‚Äù he huffed and looked at her, folding the newspaper and getting up after another minute of her just staring at him. ‚ÄúJust tell me what you‚Äôre thinking. Do you want something?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúN‚Ä¶no, nothing like that. I just, well, we‚Äôve been married for three years now.‚Äù she kind of stammered a bit.

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He nodded and drank the remainder of his coffee.

‚ÄúYou once told me, I, we, could have a baby after three years of marriage.‚Äù She bit the bullet and told him what she was thinking.

‚ÄúDid I, I don‚Äôt recall that.‚Äù He frowned right at her.

‚ÄúYes, it was just after our first anniversary at your mother's house,‚Äù she told him. She recalled it very vividly.

‚ÄúFor mothers' benefit only then‚Ä¶ Did you try and get pregnant last night?‚Äù he was suddenly frowning right at her now.

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm still on birth control.‚Äù She shook her head and looked at her watch. It was almost time to go and take it, she realised.

‚ÄúGood, stay on it,‚Äù Cal stated and headed for the door. ‚ÄúThere will be no baby inside this marriage.‚Äù He looked right at her. ‚ÄúI mean that, not inside this marriage, am I clear.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù She murmured as pain touched her chest. She watched him leave the room and thought about those very words ‚Äòthere will be no baby inside this marriage.‚Äô ‚ÄòFor his mother's benefit,‚Äô but he‚Äôd looked at her that day and nodded at her, as if to tell her yes he meant it. They could have a baby together if their marriage lasted that long.

The man she loved, her husband, didn‚Äôt want to have a baby with her. When she left this marriage she would once again be alone. A part of her she knew, as to think he would want that with her. She was just a contract wife. A convenience for him to show he was a family man was all.

She got up and walked outside. Maybe it was time to ask for a divorce herself, either one of them could ask for it. There was an exit clause, though if she asked for it, she had to give up everything and leave with nothing. Her whole life was here now, revolved around that man.

She‚Äôd learned how to eat correctly, dance properly, and had etiquette lessons that first year as well. She even learned how to apply make-up and do her hair. All things that were needed to be his wife, to be seen on his arm. The only things she didn‚Äôt get in this marriage was an actual wedding, his heart, and to kiss the man she loved. Everything else was hers until they got divorced. 

She walked up to the cliff at the end of the property and sat down on the seat that was there. It was her favourite place to go and think. The wind would whip away her thoughts and clear her mind, and she liked the smell of the salty sea breeze as well. She should have held her tongue and she knew it. Should have known better than to ask to have a family.

She, and family; those two things she didn't think really mixed. Though his family liked her, and she got along with his mother and father, his sister all quite well. They were nice normal people, everyday average people like she was. Cal had not been born wealthy, he had created his own wealth at 25, made a name for himself and continued to do so to this day.

He ran his own company, enjoyed buying smaller companies and absorbing them, growing them, head-hunting the top computer programmers. She knew who they all were. That was her world. Though she worked remotely now, she could work anywhere in the world. She sat up there and looked over the ocean as she wondered where she would go when she got that divorce, and wondered if she should start looking now. He'd been unhappy with her question and she knew it; she recognised that expression on his face.

That one question could well be her undoing in this marriage. She sighed softly and looked out there at the ocean and wondered if one day she would have someone to call, son or daughter. Though she knew right now that it wasn‚Äôt going to be with Cal, that was now a given. ‚ÄúThere will be no baby in this marriage.‚Äù She mimicked his words. But then she huffed at herself and got up. She wanted a baby, and she wasn‚Äôt getting any younger; She was already 28. Maybe it was time to move on, away from him and this life he gave her, but also at the same time, how could she? When she loved him.

Calvin

He stood prowling around in Wil‚Äôs office. The man was on the phone, and it wasn‚Äôt even 9am yet. Cal was annoyed right this minute, his plan to ask for a divorce this morning had not happened. Rin had just completely blindsided him with that question about her wanting a baby with him.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs got you all worked up?‚Äù Wil finally asked when he ended the call. The man had been watching him prowl around the room. ‚ÄúDid Rin lose it when you asked for the divorce?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt ask her for one,‚Äù he muttered.

‚ÄúWhat? Why not? That was the plan,‚Äù Wil stated with a frown.

‚ÄúI just couldn‚Äôt. She was happy last night, giggled at me and then this morning‚Ä¶‚Äù he sighed. ‚ÄúShe asked me about having a baby.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat!‚Äù Wil stared at him now.

‚ÄúYeah, that was my reaction.‚Äù Calvin stated, ‚ÄúHow could I ask for a divorce on the back of that conversation? She would think it was because she had asked for a baby. That‚Äôs just wrong, I‚Äôm not that cruel.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou say that, but that girl is in love with you, Calvin, you said so yourself. Told me she was all curled into you after your second wedding anniversary and murmured she loved you in her half-addled sleep state.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù he muttered, and a slight smile touched his face at the memory of it. She‚Äôd been so cute, hugged into him patted his chest a little and sighed all softly, kind of dreamily murmured ‚ÄòI love you, Cal.‚Äô She was the only one allowed to call him Cal. Everyone else called him Calvin or Mr Reeves.

‚ÄúYou should have asked for a divorce back then,‚Äù Wil muttered, ""now look at what you‚Äôve got yourself into.""

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt ready then.‚Äù He sighed and sat down on the man‚Äôs couch, and he hadn‚Äôt been. Yes, she was his wife, but it was contract marriage and he‚Äôd never looked at her in any other way than that. ‚ÄúI have to ask for it now, I just couldn‚Äôt do it today as planned.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, the sooner, the better, you know this. Even a no-contest divorce, which it will be, will take six weeks to settle and be finalized, so I suggest you start making those plans of yours come to light. Or she might just ask for it herself. Do you really want that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúIt has to come from me,‚Äù he nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll sort my end out today. I know where she dreams of going on holiday. It‚Äôs not half obvious her screen saver is the place she wants to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen make the plans, you keep her passport, right?‚Äù Wil stated.

‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs with mine. I‚Äôll get it all sorted out, the flights and accommodation, the tours I know she‚Äôll want to go on.‚Äù he nodded decisively. His mind was made up.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot of effort for a divorce, you know that right.‚Äù Wil shook his head.

‚ÄúMm, I‚Äôm the good guy, remember.‚Äù Though he didn‚Äôt feel like it right now, that girl had nobody, dumped in an orphanage and then raised in the foster system. He was surprised she was so well-adjusted. He shook that off and stood up. ‚ÄúWhen will the papers be drawn up?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen you list off what you want in them, I‚Äôll draw it up today I got the time, no court today myself. What is she getting?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe house we share, and four million dollars should do it. Then that holiday all paid to her dream destination. I‚Äôll make it first class, as well.‚Äù He would spoil her a little, she deserved it.

‚ÄúAre you sure you want to do it this way, Calvin. You could simply...‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it has to be this way. We have to get divorced, it‚Äôs the only way I see her being happy. She‚Äôll understand my intent is to let her go, so she can be happy in the future.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt could backfire, you know, I‚Äôd be willing to bet there is a temper in that wife of yours.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm, I‚Äôve never seen it,‚Äù he shook his head. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs too sweet to yell and scream and pitch a fit. Likely just stare at me and mutter ‚Äòright where are the papers.‚Äô‚Äù Or that was what he was hoping for. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a big scene made out of this, keep it low-key and out of the papers.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo when are you going to do it? Will you be delivering the papers yourself? Or will I be the bad guy for your sweet-natured, loving wife?‚Äù Wil muttered.

‚ÄúI understand you don‚Äôt like it, Wil, but we can‚Äôt go on in our marriage as it is. It‚Äôs not right and you know it. I can never tell her I love her back, so it‚Äôs time to get divorced.‚Äù He stated ‚ÄúIf you can get everything drawn up by tomorrow, we‚Äôll both go to the Cliffside Estate, and I‚Äôll tell her I want a divorce and you, my friend, can hand her the papers.‚Äù

‚ÄúYay, I ain‚Äôt getting in the way if she tries to smack you one.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe won‚Äôt,‚Äù Cal stated, and she wouldn‚Äôt. She wasn‚Äôt that kind of woman.

‚ÄúGetting her heart broken, she just might. I‚Äôll have them ready to go in the morning. Best you sign them prior to going out there, so I can file them on the day, so that six-week wait starts right away.

Cal nodded and headed off to his own office. It was going to be a long and infuriatingly frustrating day, and he knew it. His mind was going to be distracted with those words she‚Äôd uttered this morning. A baby, she wanted to have a baby with him, inside a contract marriage. It was not the right thing to do, to bring a child into a marriage like they had.

So, no, he would not only not have a baby with her, he would divorce her to make sure she would understand him. He spent the day sorting out airfares and accommodation, checked on tours of the area and booked several of them: a vineyard tour, a hot air balloon ride, horseback riding on the beach. A dinner cruise on a nice yacht and a spa day, he booked the best hotels and made sure there were luxury transfers. 

All the things she‚Äôd talked about with his own mother, all the things his mother told him he should do with her,‚Äù take your wife on vacation son, make it romantic and relax, enjoy each other.‚Äù He knew what that meant. She wanted him to have a baby with his wife. Come home pregnant is what she meant.

He looked at the list of things, and printed out the itinerary. It was quite extensive, a full month-long holiday in Italy. She would really like that, she would see he‚Äôd made the effort to give her something she was interested in, her dream destination. She‚Äôd not had a holiday in the three years they‚Äôd been married, his schedule kind of hindered that. He always had events, whether they be business or charity, here or in other states or outside the country. 

He put it all together and got her passport from the safe, flipped through it. She‚Äôd been on two business trips with him, and he‚Äôd bedded her relentlessly those days they‚Äôd stayed together. His wife was beautiful and had a smile that could melt any man's heart. That was why he needed a divorce.

He wanted her to be truly happy, and she could not be that inside their contract marriage, something that was full of rules and stipulations, things he kept in place to protect her and himself. Not that it had seemed to help protect her, she‚Äôd still managed to fall in love with him. It was time to end their sham of a marriage in favour of happiness and contentment.

She wasn‚Äôt going to like it, be heartbroken, but it was for the best. He couldn‚Äôt stay in that contract marriage if he couldn‚Äôt give her what she truly wanted, and he could not.

Rin

She was out the back of the house, sitting in the shade of a large tree on a blanket. The morning was sunny, but cool, and the breeze coming off the ocean was gentle. She was working outside this morning, being cooped up in that big house for the past two days without so much as a single word from Cal, had kind of felt suffocating.

She understood he was mad at her, and that those words he‚Äôd spoken were in fact the truth. The manuscript she was working on had turned dark and emotional, to match her mood. Though she had used those feelings she‚Äôd had of heartache and loneliness to add a new twist to the tale she was weaving.

Even now she was typing away out here, she‚Äôd not really slept all that much last night, she had tossed and turned and, in the end gotten herself up to write, because it was the one thing that could shut her own emotions off or pour them into her writing. She turned her head at the sound of a car coming up the driveway and frowned instantly.

Cal never came home at this time of the day. She wasn‚Äôt even dressed appropriately, she was just sitting out here in an old pair of shorts and a tee-shirt. She did always try to dress nicely when he was around. These were clothes from her old days. She‚Äôd been feeling nostalgic and so had rummaged through her old clothes, to be her old self. She had a feeling she was about to be shoved back into her old life, and so she was dressed to match her mood.

She turned back to her work. It was unlikely he was there to see her. At this time of the day, he likely needed something from his office; he did have one here, though she never went in there. He‚Äôd told her once not to, and had also pointed out the camera that was in there. It was motion activated and would alert his phone if she did go in there.

She‚Äôd not really cared about it, didn‚Äôt work in his industry, though she knew a fair few of those that worked in his tech department. She had a computer science degree and could, if she so chose to, could go and sit in her office inside his building in the city and work all day long. She and the team she worked for, had been absorbed by C.R. Technology just before he and she had gotten into the marriage contract; that was how he‚Äôd come across her. She was the one that checked for bugs and glitches in the gaming programmes they made.

She was smart technology-wise, just not so smart in the emotional department. She had given her heart to the man she was married to, and she shouldn't have. She caught movement in her peripheral vision and turned to look, to see not only Cal coming this way but his friend and lawyer, Wil, as well. Her eyes moved to the envelope in Wil's hand; It was large. Denoting a contract of some sort.

Here it comes she told herself, and wondered how she was going to explain herself to the team, that she‚Äôd gotten divorced, when everything in her life looked wonderful, and that she had an amazing husband. They were a team of girls, and they all thought she was so very lucky to have the love of a man like Calvin Reeves. 

Little did they know she did not have his heart, and as she watched him walk towards her, Rin finally realised it was true. He may have hers, but she would never have his. It was all just a show for the public, something to keep his public image clean and family-orientated. 

She closed her laptop so that no prying eyes would see what she was working on. It was nothing to do with his company. Not even Cal knew she had a second career. She'd needed to keep that part of her life solely for herself, for the day she got divorced and she was once again all alone.

She‚Äôd never told anyone, she'd always worried it would be a complete and utter failure. Though it was not, it had taken off really well a year and a half ago, and if she was completely honest with herself, she‚Äôd kept it from Cal on purpose, because she knew this day would come, and she needed something to fall back on.

She had a secret career under her pen name Marilyn Riddley. Her romance novels sold quite well, and she now had two books in print. The rest were all online, but she had made it, and could actually earn a living from it. Not be super wealthy, but enough to sit at home and work on the next one, instead of having to go into the office and work in the computer lab.

When their divorce was finalised, she would leave her life as Marrin Reeves and become Marilyn Riddley, move away from this city, where everyone would know her as the ex-wife of Calvin Reeves. She would move to some place where no one would know her and she could live her life small and peacefully, and never have to hear his name or see him with another woman on his arm, because she knew that would just be painful for her to look at, read about in the papers or see online.

She was going to have to leave his company, it was part of the marriage contract. When they divorced, she would move on from the company so as not to cause gossip or awkwardness for him. Though he had told her he‚Äôd personally write her a glowing reference for the work she‚Äôd participated in within his company. So it would be easy for her to get another job in her field.

He might be able to see her in her field at those conferences without issue, but she doubted she‚Äôd be able to look at him with some other woman on his arm, and not feel uncomfortable inside her chest. If he had the audacity to kiss another woman in front of her, she‚Äôd likely lose it completely, even though those lips of his were never to be hers, not for a single second. That didn‚Äôt mean she didn‚Äôt think about how it would feel to have him kiss her.

Would it be all soft and sensual? Or would it be all hard and demanding? Or would it be light and playful even? She wanted to experience it all, but would never get to. No, that was only for the woman he would love, Mrs Right. 

Her heart ached as she looked at him. He was dressed as immaculately as always; a dark blue suit, white dress shirt and a blue and gold tie. He had a hand in his pants' pocket as he walked across the lawn towards hers with Wil next to him. She saw him chuckle softly and even Wil chuckled right after him.

A small part of her clung to the hope that she was wrong. This was not about them getting divorced at all, because how could he be smiling and laughing with Wil? If they were here to serve her with divorce papers. That was not a funny matter, but a serious matter.

She stood up to greet them, and she saw his eyes look over her outfit, and a frown marred his handsome face; he didn‚Äôt like her wearing this type of clothing. It was not something he‚Äôd bought for her or approved of her wearing. She smiled at him like she always did. ‚ÄúCal, you‚Äôre not normally here at this time of the day.‚Äù She stated.

‚ÄúIs that why you‚Äôre dressed like that?‚Äù he asked right back, and she could hear the disapproval in his voice. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I purchase you proper summer clothing?‚Äù

She looked down at her old clothes and half smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do some gardening. These are appropriate wear for that.‚Äù She looked back to him.

‚ÄúHmm, I suppose they are only good for getting dirty.‚Äù He nodded and looked right at her. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to get divorced, Rin,‚Äù he told her. There was no hesitation in his words. ‚ÄúIf you could sign the papers today, I‚Äôd appreciate it. It will take six weeks for the finality of it to come through.‚Äù

And there it was. She‚Äôd not been wrong, and she just knew that one question she‚Äôd stupidly asked him had brought this about. Why oh why couldn‚Äôt she have kept it to herself? Said nothing and ignored her need to have a baby with the man she loved. She told herself as she stood there staring at him. Wondering if telling him she was sorry and hadn‚Äôt meant it would work to keep him by her side. Though it was only a fleeting thought, she knew he'd made up his mind.

Her eyes moved to Wil as he opened the envelope he was carrying and pulled out the documents inside it. It wasn‚Äôt just a simple piece of paper, it looked to be quite extensive. She could well imagine there was a non-disclosure agreement there as well, for her not to ever talk about their marriage contract.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a no-contest divorce as per our marriage contract,‚Äù Cal stated. ‚ÄúI have also organised for you to go overseas on a holiday. You‚Äôve not been able to take a vacation in the past three years, that we were married. I‚Äôve accounted for that and an all-expenses paid trip has been organised for you, as part of the divorce agreement.‚Äù",1,1755400943.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best wood plates combine durability, aesthetic appeal, and food safety. Understanding these key features will help you choose the perfect set for your needs.

**Wood Type:** The type of wood used significantly impacts the plate's durability, appearance, and maintenance requirements.

Different wood species offer varying levels of hardness, grain patterns, and resistance to moisture. Popular choices include acacia, bamboo, maple, and teak. Acacia wood is known for its durability and rich, dark grain. Bamboo is a sustainable option that is lightweight and naturally antibacterial. Maple provides a smooth, light-colored surface, while teak is prized for its water resistance and elegant appearance. The choice of wood should align with your aesthetic preferences and intended use.

**Size and Shape:** Wood plates come in various sizes and shapes to accommodate different types of food and dining styles.

Consider the intended use of the plates when selecting the appropriate size and shape. Smaller plates, typically 6-8 inches in diameter, are ideal for appetizers, desserts, or side dishes. Medium-sized plates, ranging from 9-11 inches, are suitable for main courses or salads. Larger platters, exceeding 12 inches, are perfect for serving family-style meals or displaying charcuterie boards. Round, square, and rectangular shapes each offer a unique aesthetic appeal and functionality.

**Finish and Coating:** The finish and coating applied to wood plates play a crucial role in their durability, food safety, and ease of maintenance.

A food-safe finish is essential to prevent the wood from absorbing moisture, stains, and odors. Natural oil finishes, such as mineral oil or beeswax, are popular choices for their non-toxic properties and ability to enhance the wood's natural beauty. Polyurethane coatings provide a durable, water-resistant barrier but may contain synthetic chemicals. Ensure that the finish is explicitly labeled as food-safe and compliant with relevant safety standards.

**Durability and Maintenance:** Wood plates should be durable enough to withstand regular use and easy to maintain to ensure their longevity.

Proper care and maintenance are essential to preserving the quality and appearance of wood plates. Avoid placing them in the dishwasher, as the high heat and harsh detergents can damage the wood. Instead, hand-wash them with mild soap and warm water, and dry them thoroughly with a soft cloth. Periodically apply a food-safe oil to replenish the wood's natural moisture and prevent it from drying out or cracking.

**Design and Aesthetics:** The design and aesthetics of wood plates contribute to their overall appeal and ability to complement your dining table setting.

Consider the overall aesthetic of your dining space when selecting wood plates. Natural wood grains and finishes can add warmth and rustic charm to any table setting. Choose plates with unique shapes, patterns, or carvings to create a visually appealing presentation. Whether you prefer a minimalist, modern design or a more traditional, ornate style, there are wood plates to suit every taste.

**Sustainability and Ethical Sourcing:** Environmentally conscious consumers should prioritize wood plates made from sustainably sourced materials.

Look for wood plates that are certified by organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), which ensures that the wood is harvested from responsibly managed forests. Bamboo is a particularly sustainable option due to its rapid growth rate and minimal environmental impact. By choosing ethically sourced wood plates, you can support sustainable forestry practices and reduce your environmental footprint.

 ## Core Benefits

Wood plates offer numerous benefits, ranging from their aesthetic appeal to their environmental friendliness. Understanding these advantages will help you appreciate the value of incorporating wood plates into your dining experience.

**Enhanced Aesthetic Appeal:** Wood plates bring a natural warmth and rustic charm to any table setting, enhancing the overall dining experience.

The unique grain patterns and natural colors of wood add a touch of elegance and sophistication to your meals. Whether you're hosting a formal dinner party or enjoying a casual family meal, wood plates can elevate the presentation of your food and create a more inviting atmosphere. Their natural beauty complements a wide range of d√©cor styles, from farmhouse chic to modern minimalist.

**Sustainable and Eco-Friendly:** Wood plates offer a sustainable alternative to traditional ceramic or plastic dishes, reducing your environmental impact.

Wood is a renewable resource that can be sustainably harvested and processed. By choosing wood plates made from responsibly sourced materials, you can support sustainable forestry practices and reduce your reliance on non-renewable resources. Bamboo is an especially eco-friendly option due to its rapid growth rate and minimal environmental impact.

**Lightweight and Durable:** Wood plates are typically lighter than ceramic plates, making them easier to handle and less prone to breakage.

Their lightweight construction makes them ideal for outdoor dining, picnics, or casual gatherings. While wood is not as impervious to damage as some other materials, properly cared for wood plates can withstand daily use and last for many years. The natural resilience of wood also helps to prevent chipping or cracking, making them a durable choice for everyday use.

**Food-Safe and Non-Toxic:** When properly finished with food-safe coatings, wood plates provide a safe and non-toxic surface for serving food.

Food-safe finishes, such as mineral oil or beeswax, create a protective barrier that prevents the wood from absorbing moisture, stains, and odors. These natural finishes are non-toxic and do not leach harmful chemicals into your food. Ensure that the wood plates you choose are explicitly labeled as food-safe and compliant with relevant safety standards.

**Versatile and Multifunctional:** Wood plates can be used for a variety of purposes, from serving appetizers and desserts to displaying charcuterie boards and decorative items.

Their versatility makes them a valuable addition to any kitchen or dining room. Use them to serve individual portions of food, create stunning charcuterie displays, or showcase decorative items on your coffee table or bookshelf. The possibilities are endless.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about wood plates, providing helpful information to guide your purchasing decision.

**Are wood plates safe for serving food?**
Yes, wood plates are safe for serving food as long as they are finished with a food-safe coating. Look for finishes such as mineral oil, beeswax, or food-grade polyurethane. Avoid using wood plates with finishes that are not explicitly labeled as food-safe, as they may contain harmful chemicals.

**How do I clean and maintain wood plates?**
To clean wood plates, hand-wash them with mild soap and warm water. Avoid placing them in the dishwasher, as the high heat and harsh detergents can damage the wood. Dry them thoroughly with a soft cloth. Periodically apply a food-safe oil to replenish the wood's natural moisture and prevent it from drying out or cracking.

**Can I use wood plates for hot foods?**
Wood plates can generally be used for serving hot foods, but avoid placing extremely hot items directly on the wood surface, as this can cause warping or cracking. It's best to let hot foods cool slightly before serving them on wood plates.

**How long do wood plates last?**
With proper care and maintenance, wood plates can last for many years. Their lifespan depends on the quality of the wood, the finish, and the frequency of use. Regular cleaning and oiling will help to preserve their appearance and durability.

1msg6z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLMRecovery/comments/1msg6z6/i_almost_got_sucked_into_amwaywwg_red_flags/,I almost got sucked into Amway/WWG (red flags + lessons learned),"First off, thanks to everyone who‚Äôs shared their MLM experiences here. Reading them gave me the push to share my own story of how I was recruited by World Wide Group/ World Wide Dream Builders and Amway, in case anyone else is on the fence.

My story started when I was sitting alone by a lake downtown, feeling down after being stood up on a date. A guy (let‚Äôs call him T) randomly sat near me and complimented my old sneakers and necklace. He then started asking about my studies, goals, and life plans. Since I was lonely, I opened up. He then shared his ‚Äúlife story‚Äù about ambition, leaving behind unmotivated friends, and moving to this city to become the ‚Äúhighest version of himself.‚Äù It sounded inspiring at the time.

Before leaving, he asked for my number, saying he wanted to see if I was ‚Äúfit to be mentored by his mentors.‚Äù He made it seem selective, like only certain people got this chance. That hooked me. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to be chosen? (Red flag #1: making it feel exclusive.)

At our second meeting at a caf√©, it felt like an interview. Toward the end, he revealed he was an Independent Business Owner (IBO) and said the business was all set up for me, ‚Äúproducts, manufacturing, everything is done for you.‚Äù He made it sound too easy. Soon after, he scheduled a Zoom call with his upline, who bragged about retiring his wife through the business. Same pitch abuot the business overview and he talked about ‚Äúretiring his wife‚Äù and finding financial freedom. Aftewards, I was invited to attend a big seminar an hour away.

The seminar was overwhelming, hundreds of people in suits, the energy in the room was electric. For a 21-year-old, it felt like stepping into a world of ambitious, successful people. Some of the audience had white-collar and professional jobs already; another speaker was even an Ivy Leage Graduate?! These factors made me believe that it was a real deal.

The main speaker was charismatic, cracking jokes, and sharing his success story in a way that had the audience hanging on every word. But here‚Äôs what stood out to me. **Red flags I noticed:**

* Not allowed to record anything.
* Instead of explaining the actual business model, they just pushed positivity and ‚Äúyou can do it‚Äù energy.
* The guy literally drew a pyramid on a whiteboard while insisting ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt a pyramid scheme.‚Äù
* They gave us pamphlets at the end of the WWDB meeting containing the business overview, compensation plan, and commission I get once I sponsor other IBOs

Afterward, I did my own research (thank God for Google). I found lawsuits, YouTube testimonials, an old Dateline documentary, and countless Reddit threads. More red flags: there aren‚Äôt any posters about the seminar online, WWG had laughably low social media presence,¬† and their ‚Äúwelcome video‚Äù looked like something from a college group project. This was supposed to be a massive e-commerce empire? Yeah, right.

In the end, I texted T to say I'm no longer interested. I was disappointed because I thought he was a genuine friend, but it was all just recruitment tactics.

**Lessons learned:**

* MLM recruiters target people when they‚Äôre vulnerable or looking for opportunity.
* If something sounds too good to be true (‚Äúeverything is done for you‚Äù), it probably is.
* Do your own research. Legit businesses have a solid online presence and transparency.
* ‚ÄúMentorship‚Äù isn‚Äôt mentorship if it‚Äôs just funneling you into their system.

I walked away embarrassed I almost fell for it, but grateful I trusted my gut and looked deeper before signing anything. I thought I‚Äôd met someone genuine who wanted to help me, but in reality he was just another person pulled into the MLM mindset. At the same time, I‚Äôm grateful because the only thing I wasted in all of this was my time.

Hopefully, this helps someone else avoid the same trap.

**TL;DR:** Got approached at a lake by a ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù guy who slowly tried to recruit me into Amway/WWG through coffee meetings, Zoom calls, and a flashy seminar. Red flags: selective ‚Äúmentorship,‚Äù no recording allowed, vague hype instead of business details, speaker literally drew a pyramid while denying it‚Äôs a pyramid scheme, and little online presence for a supposedly huge company. Did my research, realized it was a classic MLM trap, and walked away. Embarrassed I almost fell for it, but thankful the only thing I lost was my time.",1,1755400842.0,MLMRecovery,0,1.0,False

First off, there have actually been students who got into flings with teachers. Not just one, but three different students with three different teachers. How does that even happen in a school setting? Super unprofessional.

SHS and JHS also don‚Äôt have the best reputation. A lot of teachers are close-minded, some act super unprofessional, favoritism is obvious, and if you‚Äôre a ‚Äúsipsip,‚Äù you basically get away with anything. On top of that, some teachers even talk about students‚Äô personal problems in the faculty room, like it‚Äôs gossip. Imagine trusting a teacher with something private, only for it to become chismis among staff. That‚Äôs messed up.

And then there‚Äôs the weird ‚Äútoo close‚Äù dynamic, some students literally hang out with teachers for coffee after class. It just doesn‚Äôt look right and definitely blurs boundaries.

To be fair, college in CSAB gets better feedback compared to SHS/JHS. But with stuff like this going on in the lower levels, it really says a lot about the culture there.",9,1755400822.0,Bacolod,9,0.7,False

**Parsing the Odds: Who‚Äôs the Favorite?**  
The books are screaming ‚ÄúLotte Giants, baby!‚Äù like a toddler with a megaphone. Across all major platforms, the Giants are the -150 to -160 favorites (decimal odds \~1.58‚Äì1.62), implying a **61.5%‚Äì62.5% chance to win**. The Samsung Lions, meanwhile, sit at +225 to +236 (decimal \~2.25‚Äì2.36), translating to a **31.5%‚Äì43.5% implied probability**. That‚Äôs a *huge* gap in baseball terms‚Äîlike the difference between a perfectly executed bunt and a player tripping over first base while trying to touch it.

The spread reinforces this: Lotte is -1.5 runs, Samsung +1.5. The total runs line is locked at **9.5**, with even money on Over/Under. Given Lotte‚Äôs dominance in the odds, expect a low-scoring game unless Samsung‚Äôs bats decide to wake up from a 10-year hibernation.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Updates, and Why Your Team‚Äôs Mascot Is a Jerk**  
Let‚Äôs start with the **Lotte Giants**, who are as stable as a yoga instructor on a trampoline. Their ace, **Jung Hwan-sik**, is back from a ‚Äúmysterious elbow injury‚Äù that turned out to be him accidentally leaning on his phone during a Zoom meeting. His return is a game-changer‚Äîassuming he doesn‚Äôt spend the game side-eyeing the umpire for calling a strike zone that doesn‚Äôt align with his coffee order preferences.

The Giants‚Äô offense? A well-oiled machine with a .289 team batting average. Their third baseman, **Choi Ji-man**, is hitting .333 this season, which is either a sign of skill or proof that he‚Äôs secretly a robot named ‚ÄúChoi Batbot.‚Äù

Now, the **Samsung Lions**‚Ä¶ oh, the Lions. Their star outfielder, **Lee Dae-ho**, is ‚Äúday-to-day‚Äù with a hamstring injury he suffered while *practicing yoga to improve flexibility*. Samsung‚Äôs pitching staff? A rollercoaster of inconsistency. Their starter, \*\*

Our family has cruised quite a bit and know what to expect‚Ä¶ we had a blast. We are not huge party people but we did get the drink package at 50% off and loved not having to think about it while cruising. Whether for specialty coffees or bottled waters or drinks, this was a win and we‚Äôd never bought it on our other cruises. 
The staff was amazing and I‚Äôm not kidding. Our last cruise was on carnival and I got off thinking I may not want to cruise again. To be fair it rained the whole trip and the crew was miserable and didn‚Äôt want to be there and I was with them. But this was an entirely different experience. We had been on allure twice on 7 night sailings but this service just seemed exceptional compared to any other cruise. We talked to a lot of the staff when we could, they seem happy and grateful and have worked for RC for anywhere from 8-24 years. 
CocoCay was so nice, we did hideaway beach and really enjoyed the pool with swim up bar and also the beach. Bathrooms were clean. Food was ok, not great here.
Main dining food however seemed better than I remember. Enjoyed everything especially the French onion soup.  Windjammer was decent just busy. Loved the solarium, hung out here the most. Ate breakfast and lunch here a few times also and had good experiences. 
We loved the schooner bar the most and the piano bar music. Aqua80s was amazing. Getting in and off the ship was so simple and quick, like nothing I‚Äôve ever experienced and such a nice surprise! Loved the new elevator setup.. win!

*August 17, 2025 ‚Äî 5:00 AM (UTC)*

The KBO‚Äôs latest clash pits the **KT Wiz** against the **Kiwoom Heroes**, a matchup as balanced as a batter‚Äôs swing‚Äîunless you ask the odds, which treat this like a one-sided math test. Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a catcher blocking a pitch and the humor of a fan eating a hot dog in the 9th inning of a 12-12 game.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)

The betting market is screaming: **KT Wiz is the clear favorite**. Decimal odds of 1.5 (roughly -200 in American) imply a **60% chance of victory**, while Kiwoom Heroes‚Äô 2.5 odds (roughly +250) suggest they‚Äôre the underdog equivalent of a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù on a pop quiz.

The spread reinforces this: KT Wiz is giving 1.5 runs (-150 odds), meaning they‚Äôre expected to win by at least two. For Kiwoom to cover, they‚Äôd need to either A) invent a time machine to undo this game‚Äôs odds or B) unleash a rally so dramatic it makes *The Lion King*‚Äôs ‚ÄúCircle of Life‚Äù segment blush.

The total is set at 8.5 runs, with the **Over** priced at 1.8 (implied 55.6%) and the Under at 1.95 (51.3%). Given KT‚Äôs dominant pitching and Kiwoom‚Äôs offense that‚Äôs about as loud as a whisper, the Under might be the safer bet unless someone spills a Gatorade bucket on the field.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Absurdity, and a Sprained Metaphor

KT Wiz enters this game with the health of a 30-year-old in a 20-year-old‚Äôs body. Their ace, **Jung Woo-ram**, is riding a seven-game win streak, his fastball as consistent as your morning coffee habit. Meanwhile, their bullpen? A well-oiled machine that‚Äôs struck out 32 batters in 24 innings this month.

Kiwoom Heroes, meanwhile, are playing with one hand tied behind their back (probably from tying their shoelaces too tightly). Their star slugger, **Choi Ji-hwan**, is sidelined with a ‚Äúmild hamstring strain‚Äù sustained while

Trevor found the interior of Aisling Inn put him off balance as much as the bourbon had. The ceiling reached out at odd angles that canted inward and then out again on its way up to what was presumably the apex of the middle spire. The balcony of a second floor was visible, but dipped behind seemingly random pieces of wall, each of which held a variation of the same abstract mural; inverted pyramids pierced in and out of each other to both complete and interrupt their lines. Skylights cut into the idiosyncratic design, allowing the harsh red of twilight to spill into the foyer. They made their way past a large stone fireplace that sat unlit in the corner with a small group of comfortable looking chairs gathered in a semi-circle around it.¬† Across the floor was red and orange carpeting that looked to be covered in a type of foreign alphabet he couldn‚Äôt quite place.¬†

Arthur stopped them in front of a large greeting desk. Behind it stood a tall woman in a gray dress suit with brown hair wrapped into a tight and modest bun. Her nose and chin were sharp and her eyes were bright green. ‚ÄúI see my husband has brought home a stray,‚Äù she said with the same odd accent as Rory. Her thin lips tilted to one side in a smirk.

‚ÄúAye, and the man needs some rest.‚Äù Arthur leaned across the desk and planted a kiss on the woman‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúDillon, this is my wife, Agneta. Agneta, this here‚Äôs Dillon; a wayward soul in need of sanctuary.‚Äù

Trevor offered a wavering hand to shake and Agneta took it lightly. Her skin was smooth and warm against his and he felt himself longing to hold onto it for too long. ‚ÄúMy pleasure,‚Äù he uttered.¬†

She held his stare. ‚ÄúIndeed. A bit too much of the local concoction, I see?‚Äù

Trevor smiled, embarrassed. ‚ÄúJust a bit stronger than I expected.‚Äù He found himself consciously drawing his shoulders back to stand up straight in her presence.

Arthur patted him on the back, knocking him back off balance once more. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll leave you to it. I‚Äôve got to follow up with Rory before I turn in. Need to be sure he‚Äôs learned his lesson.‚Äù He winked at Trevor and strolled back across the lobby and out the doors.¬†

Agneta produced a large metal key from behind the counter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you to your room.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Trevor croaked nervously. He swallowed at the knot that formed in his throat.

‚ÄúFollow me.‚Äù¬†

As she made her way over to the stairway next to the counter, Trevor followed. Before meeting her at the bottom step, in an absentminded move, he removed his wedding ring and dropped it into his pocket.

Their footsteps were soft against the carpeted steps. *Intimate* was the word he found coming to mind. Trevor‚Äôs eyes fell onto her lithe claves that flexed as each high heel clad foot found purchase.¬† Rita had worn heels the night he had met her. They had walked around the block from the small coffee shop where the date had started and his eyes had wandered just the same then. *Just the same as you did with Ellen*.¬†

He broke the suffocating silence. ‚ÄúSome interesting design choices going on in here.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yes,‚Äù she said without turning. ‚ÄúOur founders brought over their love for art from home. It‚Äôs not so much tradition as it informs a certain way of life here.‚Äù

The statue of the child with empty eyes and the ram-horned snake passed through Trevor‚Äôs mind. ‚ÄúWhere exactly is that? Home, I mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe farthest back we can find is from when the Norsemen held control over the R√¨oghachd nan Eilean; what you would know as the Isle of Mann.‚Äù

*That explains the accents.* ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs quite a history.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIndeed. We‚Äôve carried on many things from the old days.‚Äù They reached the second floor, but she stopped and nodded to something hanging above them. A wooden plaque of similar design to the one hung at the bar was nestled into the wall above them. ‚ÄúIN THE LAND OF PLENTY, WOMEN SERVE THE NEED‚Äù.¬†

Trevor couldn‚Äôt help but ascribe his shameful and sudden feelings to its words. *Why did she point it out? She‚Äôs just ribbing you. You‚Äôre drunk, don‚Äôt be stupid.* He realized she had already started down the hall and hurried after her.¬†

As he caught up with her, she stopped in front of room 217 and held out the key to him. ‚ÄúThis will be yours.‚Äù

With fingers he hoped she didn‚Äôt notice were shaking, he took the key. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù He expected her to walk back downstairs, but instead, she simply stepped aside. Carefully, he slid the shaft of the key into the lock and felt the teeth brush against the tumblers as it drove home. Blood coursed through his body and into his brain and the lightheadedness he was struggling with from the local brew was enhanced.¬†

*Something‚Äôs not right‚Ä¶*

The key turned, but not without considerable effort. He could hear the bolt shift within the door. Sweat filmed over his palms, causing them to slide a bit on the heavy copper knob as he turned it.

The room was quaint.¬† Wallpaper wrapped around with abstract stalks of corn rising to the ceiling at canted angles. A single bed with brown linens sat against the wall. Thick curtains of a royal green covered all but a crack of the twilight beyond a window.¬†

‚ÄúI hope you find this comfortable.‚Äù Agneta had stepped in behind him.¬†Close enough that he could smell her sweet perfume. 

Trevor found that he wanted to draw her closer. He pictured himself wrapping his arm around her waist to feel her hips press against his.

*Stop. What the hell has gotten into you?*

Agneta placed a hand on the door. He noticed her smooth fingers that tapered off into well kept and shaped nails.¬†

‚ÄúThank you, it looks very nice,‚Äù he said, clearing his throat.

Agneta gave a knowing smile. ‚ÄúThen if there‚Äôs nothing more I can offer you I‚Äôll be on my way.‚Äù

He nodded and offered a good-natured wave.

‚ÄúGood night, Trevor,‚Äù she said as she closed the door.

*That‚Äôs not what she said, that‚Äôs not what she said‚Ä¶*

Trevor sat on the edge of the bed, eyes locked onto the light reaching under the locked door. He had sat as such for the past 45 minutes, attempting to convince himself that it had been a slip up in his mind. There was no reason for Agneta to know his real name. It was impossible.¬†

*But is it? Did she take your ID?*

With fingers that didn‚Äôt have all of their feelings he fumbled his wallet out of his back pocket and produced his driver‚Äôs license. *Trevor Dillon Ander*. It had been safely tucked away so there was no way that she could know.

He couldn‚Äôt place why the idea troubled him so; Arthur seemed good-natured enough, if not a little prying. The bartender was a bit impatient, true. The machines Rory had spoken of also crept back into his mind. *Lost in the corn, they were...in the corn. In the Land of Plenty.*

‚ÄúPlenty of bullshit,‚Äù he said to the empty room.¬†

He decided that he would set his alarm for early in the morning, and get out of dodge before any more peculiar locals decided to introduce themselves.

He lay back into the bed and closed his eyes.

*...in the corn‚Ä¶*

*...you‚Äôll find paradise...*

*Corn surrounds him. Above there is nothing; instead there is the void. No stars, no moon, no sun. Only dark that presses in. Corn rises in canted, unreal, pastel stalks that blur his vision. But he can hear a voice.*

*‚ÄúTrevor? Why?‚Äù It‚Äôs a woman.*

*He moves toward it, parting the stalks as if swimming through them. Somehow he is able to see in spite of the seeming antimatter above.*¬†

*More voices rise from ahead of him. They are chanting something, but it's deep enough to be more of a rumble rising from beneath the earth than sounds produced by vocal chords.*¬†

*‚ÄúWhy were you late?‚Äù He knows that voice. It is Rita. He recognizes it as the question that burned into his brain and into his heart that night. But how had they brought her here,*

*(to paradise)*

*and why is she bringing this up now?*

*The chanting grows as he draws nearer to them. There are words he does not know the meaning of. But he can hear the purpose that lies beyond his understanding. ‚ÄúZaahat Kall‚Ä¶Zaahat Kall‚Ä¶‚Äù It drones on, increasing in intensity with each repetition.*

*‚ÄúYou were late and it all fell apart.*‚Äù

*He breaks into a clearing where a large circle of naked, faceless figures sway gently, like corn in the wind. Dots of red sit in the shadow where their faces are not. Beyond the circle stands the statue of the child, with streams of blood pouring from its empty eye sockets past its manic smile. In the middle of the circle is a woman tied to a large post.*¬†

*It‚Äôs Rita. Her face is calm and her fiery hair dances in a wind that doesn‚Äôt exist. ‚ÄúYou were late and they lost the machines. Lost paradise‚Ä¶‚Äù*

*The circle stops their swaying and the shadow faces, with their crimson eyes, turn to look at him.*¬†

*Trevor wishes to run, but is paralyzed by their sight and their chant that grows ever louder. ‚ÄúZaahat Kall...Zaahat Kall‚Ä¶‚Äù*

*The woman is now different. The red hair¬† has turned brunette and wrapped into a tight bun. She is wearing a gray dress suit. It is now Ellen tied to the post. She is crying and wrenching against her binds. ‚ÄúWhy, Trevor? Why did you do this to me?‚Äù*¬†

*He remembers that night, all of the nights. The reasons Rita left that he continues to push down inside. He can‚Äôt be late. Rita will suspect. He was late from the start.*

*Ellen is now a woman in dirty trousers and a shirt torn to shreds. Her engorged breasts are exposed and her stomach hangs loosely, deflated, and dripping with blood. She sobs at him. ‚ÄúWhy? You were late, yet you return. The machines!‚Äù*

*A horrendous, metallic grinding erupts from behind him.*¬†

*The chanting grows. ‚ÄúZaahat Kall‚Ä¶‚Äù*

*The circle raises their hands to the void.*

*As the metal on metal roar grows closer he looks up to see Agneta descend from the nothing. She is adorned in a billowing dress of red and black. Somehow he can tell the void flows from her. Her voice booms around him. ‚ÄúParadise will rise!‚Äù*

*The grinding is deafening as it‚Äôs joined by the chant. It envelops him.*

Trevor awoke plummeting from the bed onto the floor. Before he realized what was happening, his forehead and nose crashed into the unforgiving hardwood. The room spun as he tried to piece everything together.¬†

*The land of plenty...remember?*¬†

A groan escaped him as he rolled onto his back. He gently rubbed his face and examined his fingers.¬†

*No blood, at least you didn‚Äôt break your nose.*

The thought of blood brought everything back into clarity. *Why did you return?* Though words uttered within a dream they still held a terrifying weight over his head. He climbed to his feet and checked his phone for the time. His own reflection stared back, darkened by the unilluminated screen.¬†

‚ÄúDead already?‚Äù He held the power button down, but the screen remained a defiant black. Had he overslept? Doubtful; he could still feel the heaviness of the alcohol in his head. He brushed his back pocket and found the keys bulging against the denim. 

*Just leave.* 

Trevor found that to be enough of a plan. The combination of the town‚Äôs odd symbolism and his unsettling dream was enough to wish for the simplicity of empty cornfields once again.

He walked to the door and stuffed his phone back into his pocket, feeling the cold metal of his wedding band still nestled away. Guilt threatened to overwhelm him. *Stop, now‚Äôs not the time*. He slipped it back onto his hand and turned the knob.

As he opened the door his hand instinctively came up to shield his eyes. ‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù A searing red light pierced through the skylights of the lobby and bathed every corner of the large room in crimson.¬†

Dull nausea rose in his stomach. He approached the railing of the second floor balcony as if edging towards a cliff. In an attempt to see what would cause such a phenomenon, he squinted his eyes against the harsh light. The apex of the middle spire disappeared behind a glare that spread across the windows, as if large stage lights had been placed atop the hotel.¬†

With one hand gripping the railing, Trevor made his way to the stairs. As he moved, the shadows of the canted, ascending ceiling designs danced and the inverted pyramids quivered. The optical illusion made him feel as if he were traversing the innards of some long forgotten beast, ageless and cosmic in scale. *Half-buried in an earth unable to hide it.* He shuddered and quickened his steps.

He was thankful for the carpeted stairs as he hoped to make his exit with as little noise as possible. Something was wrong in Rickledge and he had no intention of finding out what it was. His feet came to the ground floor and he fished out his keys as he half jogged towards the double doors.¬†

A creak sounded to his left and he froze. He suddenly became aware of the noise of crackling fire. Panic crept up his throat as he slowly turned to the fireplace. The semi-circle of leather chairs were now occupied by older men and women. Their faces were all twisted into a rictus grin, as if they had been waiting for him eagerly. Their eyes were all locked on him as flames danced in place of their pupils.

‚ÄúOh, fuck this.‚Äù Trevor bolted for the front doors. He could hear the scrape of the chairs‚Äô legs against the floor behind him and knew he wouldn‚Äôt have long. His hand found the handle and pressed down on it as he threw his shoulder into the door. He nearly stumbled over his own feet as it swung open.

He looked into the sky and his mouth hung open in shock at what he saw. *Hell must be spilling over.* There were no stars, no sun, no moon. Only red. The brewery stood dark, unlit against the bloodied horizon. Its parking lot was empty and his stomach knotted as he realized his car was nowhere to be found.

A voice behind him broke his horrified reverie. From within the hotel, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the idiot who left the doors unlocked?‚Äù¬†

He ran towards the brewery, away from the mad people with fire eyes. As he crossed the street he could hear the doors burst open once again and the same voice cry out, ‚ÄúThere he goes!‚Äù¬†

Trevor scanned his options and knew there was only one. He ran into the corn.

*The land of plenty...remember?*¬†

A groan escaped him as he rolled onto his back. He gently rubbed his face and examined his fingers.¬†

*No blood, at least you didn‚Äôt break your nose.*

The thought of blood brought everything back into clarity. *Why did you return?* Though words uttered within a dream they still held a terrifying weight over his head. He climbed to his feet and checked his phone for the time. His own reflection stared back, darkened by the unilluminated screen.¬†

‚ÄúDead already?‚Äù He held the power button down, but the screen remained a defiant black. Had he overslept? Doubtful; he could still feel the heaviness of the alcohol in his head. He brushed his back pocket and found the keys bulging against the denim. 

*Just leave.* 

Trevor found that to be enough of a plan. The combination of the town‚Äôs odd symbolism and his unsettling dream was enough to wish for the simplicity of empty cornfields once again.

He walked to the door and stuffed his phone back into his pocket, feeling the cold metal of his wedding band still nestled away. Guilt threatened to overwhelm him. *Stop, now‚Äôs not the time*. He slipped it back onto his hand and turned the knob.

As he opened the door his hand instinctively came up to shield his eyes. ‚ÄúWhat the hell‚Ä¶‚Äù A searing red light pierced through the skylights of the lobby and bathed every corner of the large room in crimson.¬†

Dull nausea rose in his stomach. He approached the railing of the second floor balcony as if edging towards a cliff. In an attempt to see what would cause such a phenomenon, he squinted his eyes against the harsh light. The apex of the middle spire disappeared behind a glare that spread across the windows, as if large stage lights had been placed atop the hotel.¬†

With one hand gripping the railing, Trevor made his way to the stairs. As he moved, the shadows of the canted, ascending ceiling designs danced and the inverted pyramids quivered. The optical illusion made him feel as if he were traversing the innards of some long forgotten beast, ageless and cosmic in scale. *Half-buried in an earth unable to hide it.* He shuddered and quickened his steps.

He was thankful for the carpeted stairs as he hoped to make his exit with as little noise as possible. Something was wrong in Rickledge and he had no intention of finding out what it was. His feet came to the ground floor and he fished out his keys as he half jogged towards the double doors.¬†

A creak sounded to his left and he froze. He suddenly became aware of the noise of crackling fire. Panic crept up his throat as he slowly turned to the fireplace. The semi-circle of leather chairs were now occupied by older men and women. Their faces were all twisted into a rictus grin, as if they had been waiting for him eagerly. Their eyes were all locked on him as flames danced in place of their pupils.

‚ÄúOh, fuck this.‚Äù Trevor bolted for the front doors. He could hear the scrape of the chairs‚Äô legs against the floor behind him and knew he wouldn‚Äôt have long. His hand found the handle and pressed down on it as he threw his shoulder into the door. He nearly stumbled over his own feet as it swung open.

He looked into the sky and his mouth hung open in shock at what he saw. *Hell must be spilling over.* There were no stars, no sun, no moon. Only red. The brewery stood dark, unlit against the bloodied horizon. Its parking lot was empty and his stomach knotted as he realized his car was nowhere to be found.

A voice behind him broke his horrified reverie. From within the hotel, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the idiot who left the doors unlocked?‚Äù¬†

He ran towards the brewery, away from the mad people with fire eyes. As he crossed the street he could hear the doors burst open once again and the same voice cry out, ‚ÄúThere he goes!‚Äù¬†

Trevor scanned his options and knew there was only one. He ran into the corn.

1msfyud,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1msfyud/the_narrative_of_gaza_being_an_openair_prison/,The Narrative of Gaza Being an Open-Air Prison,"For decades, we‚Äôve been hearing that Gaza is an open-air prison, and whenever news pieces would talk about it, they‚Äôd include images of refugee camps in Gaza. Israelis would counter that Gaza is full of shopping malls and universities and luxury items that in no way resemble being imprisoned, but they‚Äôd largely be ignored as spreading propaganda etc. 

Pro-Palestinian accounts would also selectively focus only on the hardships in Gaza, to continue driving this narrative of all Gazans being poor suffering refugees locked in prison. And even pro-Israeli accounts, bizarrely, would accuse Gazans of having been left with a beautiful territory and destroying it, as if Gaza wasn‚Äôt full of new buildings, well-funded schools and hospitals (in addition to the terror tunnels.) 

And to be clear, I don‚Äôt deny that the *current* situation in Gaza is terrible. I don‚Äôt even deny that Gazans have been under a military occupation, with their borders, sea, sky, imports, exports, and other things controlled by Israel, all of which limited their economic growth, to some extent. (The economic slump was more due to Hamas than Israel, because the unemployment rate in Gaza was at nearly 50% even before this conflict, but the unemployment rate in the West Bank was around 12%, despite the West Bank being under a military occupation as well.)

I follow Palestinian accounts on social media to get a first-person perspective of events unfolding on the ground in Gaza and the West Bank, and while a lot of it obviously skews heavily towards bombed-out buildings and death, there‚Äôs been a growing trend of Gazans posting how wonderful and beautiful their lives were in August 2023 compared to their lives now in August 2025. 

These videos show them eating out at restaurants, getting iced coffees and pizza and shawarma, clean streets with colorful string lights and vibrant nightlife, fresh flowers and chocolates, beautiful clothing and luxury goods. 

And the comments are filled with supportive people saying things like ‚Äúso sad, hope you can have this again someday‚Äù which is all well and good, but is no one questioning *how* all this existed in a supposed open-air prison? 

Why can Gazans only talk about all the beauty and luxury after it‚Äôs destroyed? Is it because it would have contradicted the ‚Äúopen-air prison‚Äù narrative? 

And do people really not realize, when they see these videos posted by Gazans themselves, that life in the West Bank right now looks exactly like that? 

Yes, people in the West Bank suffer from injustice, harassment, violence, etc. Yet at the same time, the majority of them are living the same kind of full, enriched lives that people in Israel or in any other developed country are experiencing. 

Being a critical consumer of content means that sometimes you have to notice what‚Äôs *missing.* 

If before the war, 100% of content you saw about Gaza revolved around it being a sad oppressed open-air prison full of sad oppressed refugees, there was information *missing.*

If 100% of the content you see about the West Bank involves checkpoints, settler violence, IDF harassment, etc. - there is information *missing*. 

You have never gotten the full picture, and you will continue not getting the full picture, unless you actively seek it out, and even then there will be pieces missing. 

Yes, there are actually poor Palestinians suffering. But if 100% of the content you see about Palestinians is their suffering, you‚Äôre being lied to by omission. ",12,1755400148.0,IsraelPalestine,21,0.87,False

1msfy1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1msfy1h/transitioning_from_anxious_to_secure_slow_burn/,Transitioning from anxious to secure / slow burn vibes?,"Hey everyone,

I (29M) recently noticed a pattern in my dating life. I‚Äôve historically had more of an anxious attachment style. So when a girl gives me attention, validation, or is constantly texting, I latch on quickly. I end up equating frequent texting with emotional intimacy, which has led me to rush things and create expectations too early.

After a recent experience, I‚Äôve realised that texting ‚â† emotional intimacy. It can be fun, but it‚Äôs not the same as actually building something deeper in person. I‚Äôm trying to shift towards a more secure attachment and focus on a slower burn.

After a lame situationship that got too fast too quick, I met a new girl (29F). We had a 1 hour coffee / walk date and it went well. After the date, I texted her to lock in a second date (today). Based on our chats, it seems she is already following that healthy template. She‚Äôs communicative, but not glued to her phone, and it actually feels a lot more grounded. We texted 1-2 times a day, until a few days ago where she outlined that she doesn't expect me to text her daily since we're still getting to know each other (this is after I sent an apology for not replying sooner, as I was busy with work). 

Today is the second date (picking her up then heading to a casual spot for dinner) and I want to keep things light, fun, and present, without slipping back into old anxious habits (like overanalyzing every pause in conversation or wondering if she ‚Äúlikes me enough‚Äù).

My question: What are your best tips for handling the second date with this mindset? How can I stay grounded, enjoy the moment, and build healthy momentum without overthinking?

Appreciate any advice from people who‚Äôve been through this shift.",2,1755400076.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

   He calls me ""bestie"" although I believe it to be a sort of way he speaks with friends, he's the type to also call his friends ""Girllllll"" although I've noticed he has slowed to a stop after I mentioned I was nb.  


***Info dump ig:***  
   We talk daily online and are very relaxed and casual with each other. We have hung out irl but not by ourselves unless we were walking to class, although we do plan to meetup as he offered me to come to the gym with him and we talked about getting coffee together. I have offered to take him to a orchard which he said ""Honestly I would really like that"".  
   He mentioned how he loved we were opposites our gender preference of ships and I feel like he's been wanting to do things together more but idk.  
  
   We have many common interests and fandoms and have talked about ships. We usually chat about ones we like and I might be reading into it too much but when I saw him with a banner relating to this one character, I switched mine not long after to a character that is usually shipped with his; and he mentioned a few days after when we were talking about ships he suddenly mentioned how he liked those characters shipped together, it fit with the conversation yet it still felt a bit out of place in what we were talking about?  
   We're currently matching pfps with a characters who are from opposing families, and while he said he didn't know it was a ship I mentioned how I bet people shipped them- and it seems they are a somewhat popular enemy to lover type ship, and the artwork we are matching with is more 'shippy' then rivalry.  
  
   We send a lot of emoijs to each other and he does a lot of heart ones. He once gave me a small gift and even gave one to my sister even though they aren't really close, and when I sent a picture of a gift I was going to get him he send a emoji with heart eyes.

I'm applying to full-time, benefit-filled jobs left and right; I have a part time job for an after-school program which, so far, I'm enjoying quite a bit! However, it's an hour of biking everyday to make it there, or two hours of bus riding, during the hottest part of the summer. I'm very not used to doing that; I either had my own car or had people willing to drive me there. I'm AFAB and still somewhat look feminine so public transport wigs me out a lot. A lot of this is to suck it up and just do the biking / bus-riding / make friends with people with cars. I've asked my FOO (both my mom and stepdad) multiple times if they would cosign for a car loan for a cheap, but reliable car (like $13k or less) *three times in the past*. All of the times they were afraid of their credit score going down or not being able to get loans later. But then make the comment of ""oh honey if I could give you a car, I would"" WELL COSIGNING WOULD HELP ME GET A CAR, WOULDN'T IT?!?!? I had to ask my friends and THEIR family to cosign for a fucking loan and got rejected because of stuff that wasn't in their control. I've had car salespeople tell me it's hard to get a loan by myself with my slightly-below income, even when I show them my bills coming in are manageable and I can indeed pay for a car and insurance if they just give me the FUCKING chance. I was miserable under their roof, and their fighting, and the lack of space, and living in the same place where I was sexually assaulted by my sibling... I cannot go back to that. If I do I might actually hurt myself badly. I am not loved under their roof. I was told I was loved, but when I did something they didn't like, it became apparent that the love was transactional and can be taken back at any time.

My ex-partner had to do EVERYTHING for me. Cosign for my first apartment, help me move in and out, provide me rent while I did school, visited me up there... and then my family get up there for graduation and they just keep complaining about the commencement ""taking too long, we wanna go to the beach, we wanna go out to eat"" LIKE THEY HAVEN'T VISITED ME AT ALL UP HERE AND I HAD TO RENT OUT CARS FROM MY POCKET TO DRIVE 10+ HOURS TO VISIT THEM MULTIPLE TIMES A YEAR!!!!!!! And when they call, or when I ask to be driven to doctor's appointments or do errands and try and pretend to be friendly with them, my mom starts accusing me of ""hiding"" or ""being cold"" and being distant. I dunno, maybe actually being there for me would be nice? Maybe giving me room to grow and talk about my emotions instead of telling me to stop crying and not giving me help when I was sobbing and when I would fail in my classes, I would feel like a failure because school was my only outlet for my emotions and to feel wanted and included in something?!

And then they question me if moving out with a part-time job and no car is the ""best option right now"" because I could ""always move home and get a job with \[step-dad's name\]""... he works at a fucking grocery store and fucking hates it there. He does it because it's stable. I got a degree in fucking BIOLOGY. Took all these science and stats classes to get something that I like. I fell in love with teaching and supporting people in their educational journeys. I don't want to fucking stock shelves full time when this opportunity is right fucking there. With monthly professional development and mentorship opportunities. No-fucking-thank you.

I'm currently applying for part-time jobs that are within walking distance (mainly grocery, coffee shops, or retail) so that I can get more income and look better on loan applications. My credit is pretty alright, it's the income and lack of loan experience that is mostly turning them away. At this point I may go to less utilized loan services to see if they can do it. Or even do it straight up with the dealership. I don't know. At the very least, with my next paycheck, I want to get an e-bike conversion kit so the commute isn't so physically demanding on my body.

I'm tired of asking for help, and getting nothing, both in terms of money or emotional support. I get it, we didn't grow up rich. But we grew up with wiggle room and the ability and knowledge to do all of this. They just want to protect themselves. I fucking hate them. And when my mom texts me silly memes about me living with cats or to ""see how I'm doing,"" I see red. I feel so angry and tense and on edge when I see their name pop up when they call. Growing up, I felt like a emotional little kid, led by simple emotions - happy, sad, mad, angry, anxious, suicidal. But now, I feel like the hormonal teenager I wasn't allowed to be because of my SA; why did they do this to me? How do I manage money? How do I apply for jobs that are in the scientific field? How does my health insurance work? How do I engage with others meaningfully? What is my purpose? What is my higher calling?

*Who am I?*

I felt like they didn't really explain a lot at depth.  I still don't. I'm very fortunate to live apart from them currently, but it still doesn't change the fury in me, this urge to change and do better than they ever did - build financial wealth and stability for myself and the people I care about. And it starts with me, and only me. I can't wait around for them to change their minds. They had 25 to do that. And they failed.

I'm capable and ready. I am angry and ready to curb-stomp anything in my way. Is it a violent way to describe what I described? Yeah, definitely. But that drive keeps me going. Rage is the fuel to keep my engines running and I'm so fucking ready.",2,1755400027.0,EstrangedAdultKids,1,1.0,False
1msfxab,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1msfxab/storytelling_secrets_of_great_leaders/,Storytelling Secrets of Great Leaders,"What separates memorable leaders from forgettable ones? Research shows it's not just their ideas‚Äîit's how they tell their stories. A 2023 study from Stanford University (""The Neuroscience of Narrative Leadership""), led by Dr. Jennifer Aaker, found that leaders who master storytelling inspire 3x more followership and drive 57% higher team performance than those who rely solely on data.

https://preview.redd.it/jabawj0gxhjf1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a3439a07e8b9e5bfbfc1f75f66bb6b7f4697642



1. The Brain Science Behind Stories



The MIT Human Dynamics Lab (2022), directed by Dr. Alex Pentland, discovered that stories activate 7 different brain regions, while facts only engage 2. When tech entrepreneur Riya Patel presented her startup vision as a hero's journey rather than a pitch deck, she secured funding 40% faster. This aligns with findings from the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (2021) showing stories are 22x more memorable than statistics alone.



2. The 3-Act Leadership Framework



Great leaders structure stories like Hollywood screenwriters:



Act 1 (Challenge):

""When I was 23, my first business failed...""

A Yale University study (2023) showed vulnerability increases trust by 68%.



Act 2 (Struggle):

""We faced 137 rejections before...""

The Harvard Business Review (2022) found perseverance stories boost team resilience by 83%.



Act 3 (Breakthrough):

""Then we discovered...""

Neuroscience research from UCLA (2021) proves hopeful endings trigger dopamine surges that motivate action.



3. Data Wrapped in Emotion



The University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School (2023) analyzed 500 executive speeches. Those blending statistics with personal anecdotes (like how economist David Lin explained inflation using his grandmother's grocery bills) were:

‚úì4x more persuasive

‚úì2x more likely to go viral



4. The ""Hero's Mirror"" Technique



Great leaders make audiences the protagonist. When educator Maya Fern√°ndez transformed her TED Talk from ""How I Built Schools"" to ""How You Can Change Education"", engagement skyrocketed 300%. This mirrors Princeton University findings (2022) that personalized stories activate the brain's ""ownership"" circuits.



5. Sensory Language = Neural Resonance



A University of Toronto study (2023) scanned brains during speeches. Phrases like ""the bitter coffee of 3 AM deadlines"" lit up sensory cortices, making messages:

‚Ä¢17% more credible

‚Ä¢42% more actionable



Why This Matters Now



The Global Leadership Communication Audit (2023) of 10,000 professionals revealed:

\- 91% prefer story-driven meetings over data dumps

\- Teams led by storytellers report 75% higher purpose alignment

\- Story-based strategies get 60% faster buy-in



Your Storytelling Starter Kit



1. Mine Your ""Origin Story""

(What shaped your leadership philosophy?)



2. Use the ""But/Therefore"" Rule

Replace ""and then"" with causal connectors for 39% more impact (Journal of Narrative Studies, 2023)



3. End With a ""Call to Adventure""

""This is our mountain‚Äîwho's climbing with me?""



As leadership coach Elena Morales says: ""Facts tell, stories sell‚Äîbut the best stories do both.""

I left what we'll call Brighton, Colorado. Spent a month chillin' at my brother's house. Played some guitar, got really fucked up a couple times, went to a killer place with some bands, and took a lot of naps with the cat and dog. It was great to see my brother again, and his wife who's cool as fuck. It had probably been almost twenty years.

Bailed out. Hit the ramp at 1:00. Gear down. Thumb out. Two hours later got a ride about ten miles north. Dropped off. Onto the next ramp. Fifteen minutes later got picked up for a four hundred mile ride.

Dude was highly intelligent. We talked about everything under the sun until 9:30 when he dropped me off. He gave me a brand new light-weight power cell before we parted ways. Truck stop. 

I bail out around the fence in the dark. I can see where they cut the grass down around the edge of the place, and then I spot it. Somebody mowed a small strip over to a nice sandy stream bed. Perfect spot. Level. Soft. No signs of other people. Nice and dark. Good cover from trees. No rain in the forecast.

Tent up. Gear in. Back over to truck stop for munchies. Back to tent. Munch down. Vape. Cigarette. Headphones in. The Table playing until I got sleepy. Out cold.

Today...
Up with the sun. Lounged around while I woke up fully. I knew it was gonna get hot quick. Got my gear together. Out of tent. Tent down and on pack. Cross the parking lot. Into truck stop. Friendly wave from truck stop employee. In the elevator, upstairs to truckers lounge. Gear down. Phones charging.

Back down. Coffee. Sausage egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. 
Outside to smoke. Back up to lounge. Phones charged. '10:00. Time to get this show on the road.'

Gear up. Out to ramp. Gear down. Thumb out.  Smoke lit. Two drags. Van pulls over with a seventy-five year old woman in it. Dropped smoke on the ground. 'Hopefully somebody else finds this when they need it.' Gear up. Over to van. ""I can get you to Lincoln."" ""That would be great."" ""Ok. Put your stuff in the back."" Off we go.

Good conversation. Eighty-four miles later I get dropped off. Out to ramp. I turned down three rides in twenty minutes because they were going to a freeway split with no ramps.

Another twenty minutes goes by 
A woman I would guess was about twenty years old stops. Mentions she's on her way to work here in town but will take me to Omaha first. I hop in.

Fifty miles later I'm past all the freeway splits. I have her drop me off. I felt she probably didn't have much experience with hitchhikers and didn't want to take advantage.

I head over to the on ramp. Weed, cigarette. A truck pulls over waaay down the ramp. I have a limit to how far I'm willing to walk since usually if someone does that they're gonna wait until you get close and bail. One, fuck all that. Two, I'm not trying to carry this fifty pound pack any farther than I have to. Also, some times people pull over that far up because they're doing something and don't want me walking up on them.

All the way through Nebraska there were 'no hitchhiking' signs on every ramp. I got a lot of friendly waves, people were genuinely nice, and it's some of the fastest hitchhiking I've done in years. And tons of butterflies everywhere.

It turns out dude went way up to where he could turn around and came back to get me. He takes me about eighty miles, tells me he found a back way to get to his place and runs me another thirty miles.

I get dropped at a gas station. A couple slices of pizza, sack of sliced pickles, and an apple juice later I head for the ramp.
No luck. It was over a hundred degrees. No shade. I bail after a little over an hour. I head back to the gas station to use the bathroom. Decided to take a break. Grabbed some grapes. Got the stool off my pack and chilled until it cooled down.

Back to the ramp. I spied a good spot for the tent earlier. Gave the old thumb another shot until the sun set. Waited for no cars, off to the spot.

So now I'm chillin' in the tent somewhere outside of Mound City, MO.

The coffee paired seamlessly, its straightforward bitterness cutting through the richness of the dessert. The clean finish of the coffee highlighted the elegance of the Ambroisie without overwhelming it, creating a perfect harmony.

A woman I feel in love with and dated for about a year ended the relationship. (33, Virgo, pansexual, cis-woman) she was reserved and as our dating went on I could feel her pull away, the day it ended she seemed different and annoyed. I can‚Äôt really tell facial expressions and I‚Äôm known to overthink words a lot so I am usually pretty straight forward with what I say and ask. When I asked if she was ok, she said fine. And said if you‚Äôre really fine that‚Äôs ok. But if you wanted to share anything else I would like to listen. She said no and we continued. She continued to be annoyed with me and goofing around a bit. When it came time for bed she said you could play fallout on Amazon. I said no way and she was full of it. She aggressively shows me the ad and asks, ‚Äúwhy am I being such a little bitch today?‚Äù I froze, she never talked to me like that before. Were into some heavy bedroom play but humiliation was never on my list and nor hers so I knew she meant it. 

The next morning I was frozen in depression. The woman I grew to love and hope to start a relationship with just cut me down in a way I never knew. My insecurities were creeping in. I could hear my mother say, ‚Äúno one will ever love you the way I do.‚Äù Look at it now it‚Äôs just a mother‚Äôs words towards their kids. But to me, and the many abusive and manipulative ex‚Äôs I was with and one engaged to saying the same thing to me. All I could hear was I was ‚Äúunlovable, intolerable, useless, and crazy.‚Äù I finally arose and she had passively aggressively made me coffee and wouldn‚Äôt look at me. I gathered my courage to ask if we could talk about last night. She whips her head around and said ‚Äúyeah, we should talk.‚Äù I tried to stay calm and not let an identity out because I‚Äôve started EMDR a couple years prior and working on being primary and not disassociate in serious conversations. She kept getting defensive with everything I was saying. And I would ask questions about some things that were on my mind to try and understand, I noticed before bed a guy texted her a few times. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it till she called me a bitch that maybe she is on her way out? And so I asked if this plus this guy are some how connected. And she asked me my thoughts. ‚ÄúWell I grabbed your phone for you because you had wondered to bed without it so I grabbed it to give you and noticed this guys name and 4 unread texts. I wouldn‚Äôt ever think you‚Äôd cheat on me but maybe he was looking for closure on something, maybe he‚Äôs a friend that I haven‚Äôt met that needed a hand.‚Äù But before I could get to any of that she yelled at me and I disassociated and I guess I had yelled back and said something mean. I apologized and ask if we can try again and she wouldn‚Äôt. I asked is she over me and this relationship and she didn‚Äôt answer me. I asked once again and added if you can just answer me yes or no that would really help me. Again, she said nothing and began to cry‚Ä¶ I told her I‚Äôm gunna take it as a yes. I proceeded to pack up all my things, telling her my struggles, my insecurities, my highs in the time we spent and hopes that she is happy and will find what she‚Äôs looking for. All while crying my eyes out. We hugged and said goodbye.

Flash forward to a few months later.

I started seeing, not dating, an ex that was manipulative and abusive. She is nice (40, Leo, heterosexual, cis-woman.) and Virgo reached out. She said she wanted to be friends and if I was available to hangout because she was in town. I said of course, and we hung out that day. It was nice, she‚Äôs quiet but found my babbling endearing, l asked her if she wanted to go see a movie and when we went to the theater we were asked to evict the building because of a gas leak. I was fresh out of ideas. She asked if we can go back to my place and watch something. I asked if you‚Äôre ok with that then that‚Äôs ok. Once we got to my place we talked seriously, I know she‚Äôs like me and would like a heads up when serious talk is coming up because it gets overwhelming. But she initiated and I wanted to be respectful. It didn‚Äôt feel like an apology but it offered clarity. The guy was an old crush that would talk from time to time and tell her about his woes, she did start to pull away because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what she does‚Äù, and she said she missed me. I was thankful and she and I also proceeded to see each other. Again, not dating. 

A couple months go by and Virgo wanted an answer. Her or Leo. I needed time to think and what I concluded was Leo was a seriously kind person. She has amazing style, easily approachable, amazing family, and was very much in love with me. Virgo, she avoids conflict, she‚Äôs GORGEOUS, she‚Äôs has hobbies opposite of mine and I loved getting involved with some of her things. (She once said she‚Äôd read to me if I ever wanted to and I desperately wanted that.) and the sex was without a doubt top tier. But I can‚Äôt have her avoid topics and I wanted some real back and forth with emotions and feelings because that‚Äôs unfortunately all I got. I told Virgo I‚Äôm gunna start exclusively dating Leo. She was not happy and really let me have it. I understood and accepted what she felt about me and that was that. 

Here‚Äôs were I‚Äôm not a good person‚Ä¶

A couple months pass.

Virgo hit me up for help with electrical problem. I‚Äôm an electrician, Leo and I are not on good grounds, and I wanted to see and talk to Virgo again, so I go and help her out we talk and catch up and she asks me about Leo, I say we‚Äôre good but she presses, I tell her the truth and she seemed upset to hear that. Once I finished helping her she asked if I wanted to stay? She‚Äôs got a pool and bought me a 6 pack of my favorite beer. We started talking and laughing and showing each other new music we‚Äôve found. We‚Äôre done in the pool and decided to watch a movie that came out and we went and changed, I went into her room after we were both done changing and looking at her she was beautiful and I thought back to the time we had and how I missed that. We embraced and kissed. The rest of the day was us hold each other and anything but penetrated sex. We talked for a bit afterwards and I was starting to. Feel guilty, I knew what I did was horribly wrong and riddled by guilt she asked if we could be together. I panicked and we cut ties there‚Ä¶.

1msfq8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1msfq8d/the_secret_history_by_donna_tartt_summary_quotes/,"‚ÄòThe Secret History‚Äô by Donna Tartt ‚Äì Summary, Quotes & Lessons from a Murderous Elite (Read This If You‚Äôve Ever Felt Like an Outsider)","Let‚Äôs be real - *The Secret History* didn‚Äôt just invent dark academia. It *is* dark academia. Published in 1992, this haunting literary thriller sold over a million copies in its first year, launched Donna Tartt into literary superstardom, and still has celebs like Taylor Swift dropping references in her lyrics. But this isn‚Äôt just aesthetic‚Äîit‚Äôs a slow-burning, reverse-murder-mystery that asks: what would you do to stay inside the world you begged to enter?

The story follows Richard Papen, a broke California kid who lies his way into an elite circle of Greek scholars at Hampden College, Vermont. He‚Äôs desperate to be seen as brilliant, tasteful, worthy. The group? Intellectual, eccentric, dripping with generational wealth and existential detachment. The vibe? Cognac, candlelight, and fatal rituals in the woods. When their obsession with ancient ideals turns violent, things spiral‚Äîand fast. What starts as one murder leads to another, and no one walks away clean.

## *Book Club Rating: 9.3/10*

## Key Takeaways:

* This is a book about *belonging*, not murder. Richard‚Äôs slow descent feels so real because he‚Äôs not evil‚Äîhe‚Äôs just scared to be ordinary.
* The line between theory and action blurs fast. Their academic obsession with Dionysus becomes an excuse for actual violence.
* The elite bubble is intoxicating‚Äîand morally hollow. Julian teaches beauty over ethics, and his students internalize that way too well.
* Intelligence ‚â† virtue. If anything, it just gives them better tools to justify what they‚Äôre doing.
* No one gets legally punished, but the guilt *eats them alive*. The aftermath is honestly more brutal than the crime.
* It‚Äôs also a lowkey meditation on class, identity, queer repression, and the cost of aesthetic purity.

## Favorite Quotes:  
‚ÄúBeauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThis is the only story I will ever be able to tell.‚Äù  
‚ÄúDoes such a thing as ‚Äòthe fatal flaw,‚Äô that showy dark crack running down the middle of a life, exist outside literature?‚Äù

## Personal Insight:  
I read this in grad school while literally sitting in seminar rooms that looked like Julian‚Äôs. As someone who also crossed class lines to be in those rooms, this hit *hard*. I understood Richard‚Äôs hunger. I also saw the danger of intellectual detachment posing as depth. Beauty without ethics is a recipe for violence‚Äîspiritual or otherwise.

If you‚Äôve ever faked it to fit in, obsessed over aesthetics, or felt complicit in a system just for being *included*‚Äîthis one will haunt you in the best way.

A classmate who worked part-time with Grace Howard couldn't help but comment. Grace was notoriously frugal, wearing $1 market stall clothes for years without replacing them, even when they were faded.



Grace smiled, ""They're not torn yet, so it'd be a shame to throw them away. I'll head out now, see you tomorrow!""



""See you tomorrow!""



After she left, the others couldn't resist discussing her.



""She wins the top scholarship every year and works multiple jobs, earning quite a bit. Why is she so thrifty?""



""She spends it all on her boyfriend, that's why she's struggling,"" one informed insider revealed.



""What?"" Everyone perked up instantly.



""He's a pretty boy who hangs out in nightclubs, using his looks to mingle with rich women. He claims to be a singer, but he's more like a gigolo. Many people know, but she's completely in the dark.""



""No way!""



...



When her paycheck came in, Grace eagerly ordered an expensive pair of sneakers.



William Stewart had wanted these shoes for a long time, and she finally saved enough to buy them as a birthday gift for him.



Just as Grace was happily imagining William's surprised expression, her phone suddenly vibrated.

It was a message from her roommate.



""I just saw your boyfriend hugging some girl, and they went into room 601 together...""



The location was the bar where William Stewart worked.



Grace Howard's heart skipped a beat, and she quickly turned her car around.



Once she entered the bar, her steps were unsteady as she approached the door of room 601, but she couldn't muster the courage to barge in.



The door was slightly ajar, with light spilling out into the dim hallway. Inside, William and the alluring woman were oblivious to Grace's presence, continuing their flirtatious banter.



""I heard you have a girlfriend studying at the nearby university?"" the woman giggled.



""What girlfriend? I haven't even touched her. She's just a dumb, plain maid who cooks and cleans, thinking she's doing me a favor,"" William replied lazily.



Maid?!



Grace felt as if she'd been struck by lightning, unable to move. But the next words hit her even harder.



""Wow, that's harsh. If she heard you say that, she'd be heartbroken.""



""You're overthinking it. No matter how I treat her, she'll always come crawling back like a dog, and I can't get rid of her even if I tried...""



Grace's blood boiled as she burst through the door. ""William Stewart, you've gone too far!""

Her whole body trembled, and even her voice shook with anger.



The two people in the room were startled. When they saw who it was, William Stewart paused for a moment, frowning. ""What are you doing here?""



Grace Howard was so furious that her words stumbled over themselves, tears streaming down her face. ""You... you have the nerve to ask me that? What you just said... was that even human? I've given you everything, and you...""



William shrugged. ""Could you take this outside, ma'am? You're interrupting my time with this lovely lady, thanks.""



With that, he continued to flirt and laugh with the seductive woman, completely ignoring Grace, even going so far as to kiss the woman's red lips.



William's humiliating actions shattered something inside Grace.



Her mind went blank, her hands and feet turned cold, as she watched the chaotic scene unfold.



The usually gentle and forgiving Grace felt her gaze harden.



She picked up a bottle of wine and slowly walked over to William.



William noticed her approaching out of the corner of his eye and was surprised. Before he could react, everything went black...

After Grace Howard left, the sultry woman looked at William Stewart, whose face was covered in blood, and belatedly screamed.



""Someone help! Will's been hurt!""



The bar erupted into chaos, with some people trying to bandage William and others suggesting they call the police.



""Forget it, no need to call the cops,"" William said, holding his wound with a complicated expression, lost in thought.



On the bus ride back to school, Grace covered her face, sobbing so hard she could barely breathe.



When she first got together with William, many people doubted their relationship, saying he was too young and reckless, not a good match.



But Grace, blinded by infatuation, fell head over heels for him.



William earned a decent wage at the nightclub, but he spent money carelessly and was always overdrawn. She paid for their dates, gave him spending money, and often went to his place to clean, do laundry, and cook. She never missed giving him expensive gifts on holidays, yet in all these years, William only gave her a rough stone pendant of unknown value.



Thinking about it, Grace yanked the pendant from her neck. She wanted to throw it out the window but worried it might hit someone, so she angrily shoved it into her bag, planning to toss it in the trash when she got off the bus.

A heartfelt devotion fed to the dogs, it was all a mistake in the end!



Grace Howard was silently cursing William Stewart, wishing him childless with a house full of kids, when a sudden brake caused her forehead to smack against the seat in front, making stars dance before her eyes.



""What happened?"" The other passengers were just as unlucky, some even fell, and curses filled the air.



""The bus broke down. You'll have to catch another ride,"" the driver apologized.



The bus erupted into chaos.



After getting off, Grace noticed a small, dusty, nondescript bar and felt an inexplicable urge.



She never drank in bars before, partly because she couldn't hold her liquor and partly because it was too expensive.



But today was different. She decided to indulge and drown her sorrows, hoping to start fresh once she sobered up.



Grace walked in with her head held high and sat at the bar. ""Give me a dozen beers!""



The bar was nearly empty, and the bartender was taken aback when he saw her. He smiled apologetically, ""I'm sorry, miss. We're closed for a private event today. Please come back another time.""



Grace felt like her world was collapsing: Why did everything have to go wrong when she was down on her luck? First, her boyfriend cheated on her, then the bus broke down, and now she couldn't even get a drink because of a private event?!



""Why isn't there a sign outside if it's closed for an event? You tell me only after I come in‚Äîis this a joke? Do you think I can't afford it? Don't worry, I have money! I'm drinking today, and I'm not leaving until I do!"" The more Grace spoke, the more upset she became, and tears started streaming down her face as she cried uncontrollably.

The bartender looked troubled and glanced over at a man sitting in the corner.



The man gave Grace Howard a brief, indifferent glance but said nothing.



Understanding his cue, the bartender smiled and said, ""Miss, don't cry. I'll get you a beer right away."" He placed the drink in front of her.



Grace, sniffling, began to drink. She had overestimated her tolerance; she was already feeling tipsy after just three bottles, far from the dozen she had boasted about.



""William Stewart, you jerk! Calling me dumb and plain!!... I got into A University as a top student without any extra classes. Call me plain, fine, but who are you, a total slacker, to call me dumb?!"" Grace ranted and pounded the table, taking swigs of beer between her tirades.



William Stewart?



The man in the corner raised an eyebrow at the mention of the name, his interest piqued by the disheveled, drunken woman at the bar.



Grace was in the middle of her rant when a glass of lemon water was slid in front of her.



Through her bleary eyes, she saw a tall, lean man dressed in black sitting beside her. His voice was calm, ""If you can't handle your drinks, don't push it.""



Too drunk to see his features clearly, she only sensed that he had a good build. She misunderstood his identity, assuming he was one of the bar's male hosts. William Stewart's bar had quite a few of those, men who entertained wealthy women for commissions. She had seen them several times before.

""I-I have plenty of money! I don't need to drink this kiddie stuff!"" In a bid to spite William Stewart, Grace Howard threw her arm around the man's shoulder and shouted, ""Come on, you drink with me! I'll give you a tip if you drink well!""



The bartender's eyes nearly popped out of his head. Did this woman even realize what she was doing? She was actually getting handsy with the boss?!



Ethan Hugh, the man Grace had latched onto, didn't show any displeasure. Instead, he looked at the bartender with interest and said, ""Bring the drinks over.""



""Y-yes, sir...""



""So, what's your connection to William Stewart?"" Ethan asked, sipping his drink while trying to get information from Grace.



""Wh-what connection? I'm his father!"" Grace declared angrily. ""He said he'd marry me after I graduated, that little brat..."" Her voice trailed off as she slumped onto the bar, completely passed out.



""What should we do next, boss?"" the bartender whispered to Ethan.



""Take her to the apartment,"" Ethan replied, retrieving Grace's ID from her bag and handing it to the bartender. ""Find out what her relationship with William Stewart is.""

""Yes!""



It was the first time Grace Howard had ever been so drunk and slept so deeply.



She didn't wake up until the afternoon of the next day, her head pounding. As she opened her eyes, she was confused: Where was she? What happened?



The bed was as soft as a cloud, and the luxurious decor was far from where she should be sleeping. Wait, she was in different pajamas? What on earth happened??



Feeling panicked, Grace quickly changed into her own clothes, grabbed her bag, and tried to leave this place of trouble. But as soon as she stepped out of the room, she bumped right into Ethan Hugh, who was casually sipping coffee at the dining table.



Ethan looked up and said calmly, ""Awake?""



This was the first time Grace had seen Ethan clearly while sober, and she was stunned.



What a... what a handsome man!!!



William Stewart was already considered the pinnacle of good looks, yet the man before her seemed to surpass even him. From his facial features to his physique and aura, everything was flawless. He could easily be described as breathtakingly beautiful. If there was anything to criticize, it would be the coldness and arrogance in his eyes, which were so intense they made others feel ashamed and hesitant to approach.



Grace was speechless for a long moment. When she finally came to her senses and tried to find something to say to ease the awkwardness, her gaze froze, and her face turned pale!

Ethan Hugh stood there in a loosely tied robe, revealing his well-defined physique. The sight was enough to send anyone's imagination running wild!



""I, we..."" Grace Howard stammered, her tongue tying itself in knots. ""Last night, did we...""



Before she could finish, Ethan already knew what she was getting at. He had intended to reassure her that nothing had happened between them. But seeing the panic on Grace's face, he suddenly felt a mischievous urge.



Ethan's lips curled into a slight smile. ""Last night, we did everything.""

Grace Howard felt like she had been struck by lightning!



She vaguely remembered what happened yesterday.



She had wanted to get back at William Stewart, so she hired this male escort to drink with her and spend some money‚Äînothing more. She never intended for it to end up in bed!



Her first time, gone just like that!



Oh my God, how much did she drink last night?! And more importantly, this male escort was top-tier handsome. How much did a night with him cost? Could selling herself even cover the fee?



Seeing Grace's world-crumbling expression, Ethan Hugh found the situation even more amusing and decided to stoke the fire.



""I usually only sell my skills, not my body. You forced me to sleep with you last night. You were too strong, and I couldn't resist. It was my first time, so you have to take responsibility. I'll turn over a new leaf and stay with you from now on.""



Grace almost fell to her knees. Was she really that terrible?!



The only man Grace had ever been close to was William Stewart, and even then, they had only held hands and hugged, never going further. With no experience, she completely believed Ethan's words, not sensing anything amiss.



This was a disaster! How was she supposed to take responsibility? She was just a poor student, not some rich lady who could afford to keep a male escort. She could barely handle William Stewart, and this guy seemed even more expensive‚Äîdefinitely not someone she could afford to mess with!

Grace Howard was in a complete panic. She wanted to run away, but her conscience kept her rooted to the spot. After all, she was the one at fault for ruining the reputation of a high-class escort. If she ran away without taking responsibility, how would she be any different from someone like William Stewart, a total jerk?



""What do you plan to do by following me? Just so you know, I don't have any money. I can't afford your lifestyle. Last night at the bar, I was just pretending because I was heartbroken...""



Ethan Hugh almost burst out laughing.



He had never met such a naive woman before. It was too amusing.



So, Ethan replied coolly, ""If you marry a chicken, follow the chicken; if you marry a dog, follow the dog. I'm willing to endure hardships with you, just don't abandon me halfway.""



""I...""



Grace barely got a word out before Ethan's phone rang. It was his trusted aide calling.



""Boss, we've fully investigated the identity of the lady from the bar. She...""



After listening, Ethan hung up, his gaze on Grace becoming more complex, deep as the ocean, and impossible to read.



Initially, he just wanted to tease her a bit and then let it go, but now things had changed.



Ethan walked toward Grace, and she instinctively backed away until she was pressed against the wall, with nowhere left to retreat.

Long, slender fingers lifted Grace Howard's chin, enveloping her in an intoxicating fragrance.



The man's face was so close, breathtakingly handsome, making the sun, moon, and stars seem dim by comparison. Grace blushed deeply, feeling her heart skip a beat for the first time.



Darn it, she finally understood the joy of being a wealthy woman.



If she were rich, she would definitely spend a fortune on such a stunning male escort!



""You're about to graduate, right?"" Ethan Hugh asked.



""How do you know that...""



""You mentioned it when you were drunk yesterday. A top student from A University won't have trouble finding a good job. Work hard and keep me.""



Ethan took Grace's phone and saved his number, then handed her a card with a charming smile. ""This is the key card to this place. Come by when you have time.""



With that, Ethan left.



Grace slid down to the floor, feeling weak.



She suddenly regretted not heeding her ancestors' advice‚Äîdrinking really was a dangerous habit!



If she could turn back time, Grace would have held herself back from stepping into the bar and tattooed ""Drinking causes trouble"" on her back, reciting it day and night!



But alas, there was no turning back. She could only look at the luxurious apartment before her, imagining her future miserable life with tears in her eyes.

Every day, Grace Howard worked tirelessly from dawn till dusk, even on holidays, only to hand over her hard-earned salary. Yet, this male escort looked at her with disdain, saying, ""Useless! This isn't even enough to cover my rent for a month. Forget about sleeping; you'll have to work overnight gigs!""



Noooo! She would be completely drained!



Grace's only romantic experience was with William Stewart, a boy who only knew how to spend her money. Male escorts, by profession, were used to spending women's money. Besides, she had been the one to take advantage of him, so she felt it was her duty to support him as a form of atonement. That's why she had such a terrifying thought.



Just as Grace was feeling utterly hopeless, her phone rang.



She picked it up and saw it was her grandmother calling, which made her heart skip a beat.



""What's wrong, Grandma?"" Grace asked cautiously.



""I'm not going to make it. If you still consider me your grandma, come home and see me!"" Grandma said harshly before hanging up.



Her grandmother's voice was strong and didn't sound like someone who was unwell, but Grace didn't dare take any chances. She hurried out of her apartment and flagged down a cab to her grandmother's house.



Grace's parents divorced when she was just a baby, and she lived with her father. When she was in middle school, her father passed away due to illness. Her Uncle Morris's family moved into her house, took the guardianship money, and reluctantly took her in.

Once treated like a little princess by her father, Grace Howard's life turned upside down overnight.



Uncle Morris and Auntie ordered her around like a maid, making her do all the dirty and tiring chores for the entire family. She worked hard at home and studied diligently, but the harder she tried, the less they seemed to like her.



No matter how clean she kept the house or how delicious the meals she cooked, no one ever praised her. They all took it for granted. And whenever she scored perfect marks, her cousin Sophie Howard, who often failed, would throw a tantrum and tear up her test papers. Auntie would then find an excuse to punish Grace by making her skip meals.



Especially Grandma, who never showed her a kind face. If she was in a bad mood, she'd raise her hand and slap Grace. Since moving into her dorm after getting into college, Grace hadn't seen this family. Why did they suddenly want to see her now?



Returning to the ""home"" she hadn't seen in ages, Grace looked at her grandmother, who was lying in bed looking quite healthy, and at her uncle, aunt, and cousin, who seemed eager and anxious. She felt at a loss.



""Grandma, I'm back.""



Grandma coughed loudly a few times. ""The doctor says I'm very ill and need a lot of money for surgery. Your Uncle Morris has been struggling with his business these past two years. You should give me this house so I can sell it and use the money for my treatment.""



Grace's heart sank. She bit her lip and remained silent.

Grandma's anger flared when Grace Howard remained silent. ""You ungrateful child! This house belonged to my son, which means it's mine. Who do you think you are to keep it from me? Get over here and sign the papers!""



Grace was quiet for a moment before she looked up and said, ""I won't sign.""



""What did you say?!"" Grandma's eyes widened in disbelief, thinking she must have misheard.



Her timid granddaughter, who had never dared to defy her no matter how much she was scolded or beaten, was actually saying no to her?

His RD is helpful and realistic with changes and suggestions.

The person I got? Absolutely disordered eating, despite claiming to make lifestyle changes.

She told me to first start seeing a DO over my HRT (my gyn put me on the HRT) and she went on to say most gyns just throw you on it and leave it at that. I guess I could benefit from that, but her further suggestions were so upsetting. I told her I work out by weight lifting in the morning, running or power walk after work, and light yoga at night to stretch. I do this about 4-5 times a week. I'm 5'6, 150 lbs, 42 years old. 

Her suggestions included: working out daily (so no rest days???), claiming I need to find indoor exercise for winter and it would do no good to only workout in the summer (even when I never brought that up and actually DO indoor exercise during winter anyway... I actually HAVE a fitness background but I didn't go into that with her). She gave me a 1200 calorie/day meal plan DESPITE me telling her I want to build muscle mass. Doesn't want me using protein powder. I looked at the recipes she sent and one included a snack of frozen grapes dusted with sugar free Kool Aid...WTF!! 

She asked me how many pounds I wanted to lose. I said well at my age I'd rather focus on healthy food choices and muscle mass. She was so committed to getting a number and suggested 135 lbs. I said but wouldn't that interfere with muscle mass? She also wanted me to get a scale that measures fat and muscle mass, and weigh myself every morning. Good God. I'm sure I could stand to lose a few pounds, but for my height/weight and goals, this seems extreme! She then told me to also measure myself with a tape measure and when I see my doctor, let them know about any inch loss and weight loss, because they love to hear that, and often don't hear enough about folks losing weight (??!). It just seems almond mom to the extreme. 

She was also telling me to drink seltzer water, pushing to stop my green smoothies and no more juice, pushing me to stop coffee (only one or two cups a day).  Yes, I know fruit is better than the juice, I only have a small glass of juice with my breakfast in the morning. My green smoothie helps me stay full (the Naked brand smoothie). The rest of the day I drink water. 

I'm so upset because it just seems too much, too fast. I'm not even a heavy weight, my BMI falls within the normal range. She told me if fruits or veggies fall within the ""dirty dozen"", buy organic or don't buy at all. I really can't afford organic on top of today's already expensive groceries. 

I just want to cry. I contacted Berry Street, because no way in hell will this work. 

Had anyone else experienced anything like this? It's not even that I want to stuff my face or anything, but logic tells me with my workouts and my goals, these suggestions will do nothing to help me, and so many of the things she was talking about just seemed like disordered eating.

Chapter 1 - The Coxcomb‚Äôs Clockwork

Usually, Vernon manages to refuse the idea that he‚Äôs had a bad day. Generally, he has fun! At home, he beats boredom and loneliness by having lots of hobbies, and singing silly songs about doing tedious things, like taking the rubbish out, doing the dishes, or doing the hoovering. He does know he couldn't get away with all this singing in a relationship ‚Äî the singing would inevitably end up being his and his ex-missus's ""irreconcilable differences"". 

What Vernon really enjoys is the sound of his own thoughts. Not his voice ‚Äî he has the good manners to keep most of the racket to himself. In fact, his verbal eloquence disappoints him. No, his pleasure lies entirely in the private symphonic reverb of his mind, when it doesn't need to be rendered into voice in real time. When each word can take as long as it needs. It is a one-man radio station with a captive audience of one. And Vernon happens to think the programming is dangerously excellent. Maybe he'll write a story or a book one day, if he can think of a nice big old agenda he can fold into it. A personal philosophy or crusade, like modern-day chivalry, or something like that. 

Unsure he could ever love anyone more than he loves his mind ‚Äî while at the same time accepting how very creepy it is to be unsure about that ‚Äî he considers himself as a bachelor. Mostly by choice, since he has had romantic opportunities he didn't follow up on. The word bachelor can carry connotations of repression, and while these may not fit Vernon‚Äôs situation, he considers them helpful, in a way ‚Äî they take the edge off questions about his personal life, and he doesn‚Äôt mind if people wonder, even if they guess wrong. Also, the word fits better than others: to feel aggrieved about the times his celibacy feels involuntary is as absurd to him as letting his dicky thyroid define his identity, but at the same time resenting his GP for it. He does know what waking up angry is, but humour is much less exhausting.

At work, he keeps a toolkit of mental and physical coping strategies. Some are rational, some ridiculous, all aimed at preserving his offbeat sense of humor. Only about four times a year do they fail. On those days, he goes home, collapses into bed, eats cereal for dinner, and watches cartoons. By morning, the crisis is forgotten, and life resumes ‚Äî thoughts administered, wardrobe fussed over, the continuation of his hobbies and collections planned.

Vernon only accepts that his day has been truly miserable ‚Äî beyond redemption ‚Äî when his internal dialogue betrays a deeper, hidden admission of defeat. He imagines this level of his psyche as a bare-knuckle pugilist, and a good one at that. He would like to have a talk with him, but no amount of meditation has gotten him there yet. He can aim his internal dialogue towards this deeper level of himself, but it never talks back. Unless he pretends it does, but then that's just his internal dialogue having dialogue with itself, is it not? That feels a little too close to praying to himself, if not outright madness, so he doesn't do that, just in case. 

The first sign that this inner prizefighter has taken one punch too many and has hit the canvas is when his internal dialogue lets out a defeated ‚Äúhmmmmmph!‚Äù By then, it‚Äôs too late for any of his usual fixes ‚Äî like a skive and a Twix, boiling the kettle for the sheer hell of it, or hiding Keith‚Äôs nasty old Sports Direct mug and waiting for the fallout. Not all of Vernon‚Äôs coping mechanisms annoy others, but some definitely do. Keith, primarily. 

Today, Vernon has had a bad day, in a weird way, and he hears his underconscious give up a loud ""hmmmmmph!"". The usual workday stuff has now just been too much. What hasn't helped this time is that up until 2:27pm yesterday, Vernon had thought it was Friday. ‚ÄúCan I really have thought this?‚Äù he wonders. If he had thought that yesterday was today, it wouldn't have taken him until 2:27pm yesterday to ask Gary what he was doing tomorrow, would it? He'd ask people that question much earlier on an actual Friday, wouldn't he? This morning before work, Vernon hadn't quite forgotten about this being his 2nd Friday of the week, but he'd forgiven himself. Then, on the train, Gary reminded him, still finding Vernon's mistake so extremely funny. Gary's bringing it up again in the break room at lunch-time had then compounded the cruelty of it all, this 2nd bloody Friday. 

At 2:27pm this afternoon, Vernon happened to look at the clock on his computer, and noted with no wry smile that it was 2:27pm again. The problem wasn't just that this 2nd Friday still had 3 hours and 3 minutes to go; the ""coincidence"" that he was looking at the clock on the same minute he'd yesterday found out his brain had ridiculed itself ‚Äî it was just too specifically ironic. He is now unable to pretend his work is enjoyable. It won't be enjoyable again until Monday. 

""Hmmmmmph"". 

Vernon flips his mousepad and derives from the tiny numbers and coloured dots there that it has been 4 months and 6 days since he last begged to go home to nurse a migraine. The cyphered mousepad also tells him that there had actually been a real headache, level 5, and the previous one ‚Äî a fake one ‚Äî just under 7 months before that. All having gone well with his boss Caitlyn, he will need to remember to add today's date to the mousepad on Monday. 

Now in a taxi home (the calling of which had been a big part of his railroading Caitlyn into agreeing he could go home, along with the power of the word 'migraine' of course), Vernon is wondering if he isn't a bit of a sociopath.

This thought started directly after he silenced the suspiciously friendly taxi driver with the finalising tone he used to say ""aye"" when the driver had asked if Vernon was done for the weekend, and now Vernon is left with his thoughts again, and feels mildly guilty for feeling happy about that. No, his sociopathy goes back longer than today, longer than the mousepad can tell him, longer than even the first (undocumented) fake migraines. When had he joined Invictus Solutions, seven years ago now? 

‚ÄúIt was a month after mum... yeah, five years and change.‚Äù 

Vernon is still a phone-grunt; hasn't made any move towards going onto the Compliance Specialist course. He knows that to start the ball rolling on that, you just need to ask Craig, and Craig needs to be asked ‚Äî Craig isn‚Äôt going to just ask you to become a Compliance Specialist, he has said that many times. Vernon knows he wasn't meant to take this as a warning never to ask Craig ‚Äî to remain in the job new-starts get ‚Äî but he must have. A month or so after you ask Craig, and you've been getting chummier with Craig, and going to clandestine meetings with Craig and sharing private smirks with Craig, you move up to the 4th floor, and you lose pals. If the fear of losing pals is why Vernon is yet a grunt, does that mean he isn't a sociopath? 

As a result of him being a grunt with five years experience  ‚Äî super adept at the computer system, points of legislature and internal politics ‚Äî Vernon‚Äôs the recently-appointed Caitlyn has had to ask him for far too much assistance to be able to manage him properly, he feels. That's how he sees it anyway. Obviously he helps train new-starts, but nobody asked him to train managers, he just ended up doing that. Plus, It isn‚Äôt like Craig has expressed any regrets at Vernon not being on the 4th floor. 

If it might be to his credit, Vernon doesn't think Caitlyn's being a pushover has anything to do with her fancying him, which she doesn't. Someone must, by the laws of averages, but not Caitlyn. No, it's his unnatural competence. She doesn't seem to have any problems keeping Gary or Chloe or Tom on their toes, probably because they are, in varying degrees and in various aspects, useless. They‚Äôll go upstairs soon anyhow. Yup ‚Äî Vernon decides, as his conscience pangs him for calling friends useless ‚Äî he's on the spectrum, if sociopathy has or belongs to a spectrum. It must, mustn't it? John Wayne Gacy and Ted Bundy at the extreme end of it, Elizabeth Holmes and The Wolf Of Wall Street somewhere in the middle but not necessarily together, and himself being on the lower end being rude to taxi drivers who are unwittingly a part of his tactical ""migraines"". As the taxi turns onto his street, Vernon decides he is only slightly worse than Ferris Bueller. 

‚ÄúYou've got to view yourself romantically, eh? No-one else will while you're alive.‚Äù

A ¬£4.40 tip should make up for the brutal ""aye"". 

""Just up the top right there mate, just after that silver car. I'll pay on my card if that's alright? Round it up to the ¬£16. Och no, it's no bother. Is that it gone through? Braw. Have a great weekend."" 

Vernon knows he will have a nice weekend; he has an idea about proving Goldbach's conjecture by staring at last night's spreadsheet of zeroless bijective bases. He also has a big new box of Weetabix Crunchy Minis. He isn‚Äôt necessarily planning on staying indoors and interacting with no-one until Monday ‚Äî but he would have to avoid friends from work, until tomorrow at any rate. If his TV and maths don‚Äôt absorb him fully until Monday, he reckons he might end up floating down to see what Kris is up to ‚Äî but Kris has been being weird lately, and Vernon thinks he‚Äôs back on the drugs. And Drew is too busy with his baby these days, which is fair enough. Vernon could call Kris and see if he wants to come around and watch TV with him, but the days when he‚Äôd have then stolen his phone, locked him in his flat and shouted through the letterbox that he‚Äôd be back in three days, well, they‚Äôre just gone now. For one thing, he doesn‚Äôt have hotel money. His flat is nicer now, his home, and his neighbours aren‚Äôt the worst now. First and foremost, though, Disney+ have put King Of The Hill on, so his IPTV guys will have put it up too. Kris doesn‚Äôt appreciate cartoons even when he isn‚Äôt rattling. Which does not make a lot of sense to Vernon, because the few times he smoked weed, cartoons were extra great. Wouldn‚Äôt the stronger stuff keep this trait? 

Vernon thinks he does just fancy a weekend by himself. It's philanthropic, in a way.



Chapter 2 - The Rending of Rinds

On such a Friday as this ‚Äî not being a payday, and the early May weather being not quite beer-garden friendly ‚Äî Vernon would find himself in the dark, gangstery pub along the road from his offices, with twelve-or-so colleagues. The same twelve each week, himself included, unless it's one of those weeks someone joins them to find out their group is more cynical than they had thought it would be. It's best not to try to look into who actually likes who; it's possible nobody in this little scene is particularly pleasant, or would have anything especially nice to say about another. Perhaps what bonds them is an ability to listen to each other's life stories with little judgement, if they even remember them beyond that night. With Vernon, his pubmates' gripes only seem to stick with him if he hears them twice or thrice, but he gets away with it, so he expects that's how the others work too. 

They start with beers and shop-talk, until whoever feels it is their turn pops off and returns with a tray of shots. They tell each other off for talking shop every so often. Then comes an awkward patch in which Jonjo will do a crap magic trick, Suze will moan about her husband, Keith will talk about some Netflix documentary that never sounds good when Keith describes it, but might later turn out to be alright if you accidentally watch it. After this interlude, they're quite relieved to go back to talking shop for another hour, before they each filter out at times depending on their particular bus or train schedules. Martin always wants everyone to go on into town, not just on paydays. No-one wants to suggest they couldn't afford an all-nighter.

""'M'on intae Glasga, Vern!"" Martin had insisted last week. ""Paul? Suze, you'll come intae Solid, naw? Bawz! 'M'on Suze! Where you gaun Vern?""

""Just goin‚Äô to get ma train, mate, I'm no intae it the night."" Vern replied, but hadn't quite landed the assertive tone he had wanted: if he‚Äôd had more funds in his account he would have gone, and might have started in on Suze to come as well.

""Train ma hole, ya wee fud, we're gaun tae get wellied, mibey even dipped ma boy! Couple e' fine lads lit us. We'll get shnookert for sure!"" 

""Naw am urny, Marty, no the night mate, ta muchly though."" Good, better. 

""Muchly? English bastard!"" Martin had responded, with not enough of a smile, and the whole phrase had haunted Vernon since. It's not just that he doesn't like being sworn at ‚Äî Martin had hit a nerve. It just hasn‚Äôt been a mental thread he‚Äôs wanted to pull at yet ‚Äî although he does think he should one day. Vernon tries to do his own psychoanalysis, and reckons he isn't half bad at it. He knows not to self-medicate with anything stronger than Pez. 

He has found that going on into town is only ever worthwhile on paydays ‚Äî not just because he'll have money to burn, but maybe he'll want more than just the usual Friday crew to latch onto later in the night. Suze drinks gin in Glasgow. The others joke about avoiding Suze after she's had started on the gin; for Vernon, this is doctrine, never to be swerved. The drunker Suze gets, the harder it gets to imagine Suze's husband is the source of every one of her woes, and she none of his. But you need to imagine this, when she's cracking on in the break room, and in the pub every other Friday evening.

Then, there's Martin. Vernon has heard more than one horror story about colleagues waking up in Martin's east-end hovel, which was described to him in a way that makes Vernon think that Martin lives in Joe Rogan's brain, uncarpeted, with many, many dogs. The rumour about Michael's eyebrow was never substantiated, as Michael wasn't ever seen at work again. Or, it was substantiated, as Michael wasn't ever seen at work again. You didn't quit a job after 5 days because nothing untoward happened at Martin's gaff that night, did you? 

But nevermind that. This Friday is a luxury Friday now. Vernon is collecting a thick brown paper bag from behind his wheely bin. It's only slightly soggy from the rain. In his kitchen he is opening the package that he now realises it is the Temu stuff he ordered ages ago and forgot about. Little soaps and fake succulents that might feminize the place. Cheeky tea towels that, upon reflection, threaten to undo the intended work of the soaps and succulents. A retro-style clock that is most definitely far too masculine. It's difficult to regret a ¬£1.55 purchase, but this is nasty. When did he order this stuff? ‚ÄúThat's the thing about Temu,‚Äù he muses as he kicks his shoes off violently back through the kitchen door at the living room radiator, ‚Äùyou pay low low prices because the items are shipped on a tea clipper that won't dock in Portsmouth until some time in late December.‚Äù He smiles at himself and decides he'll tweet this thought later on. Then again, it could attract snash from people who believe Temu aren't the most responsible sourcer of goods, so he'll think on it again later. Putting the not-quite-empty paper bag on the bunker, he puts his gas oven on to make a ""double pepperoni"" frozen pizza that he wouldn't say has a ""single"" amount of pepperoni on it. He makes a cup of instant coffee and takes his package into his bedroom for further investigation. 

OK, right, that's that tartan tie he had high hopes for! He loves it, he hadn't expected it to feel so premium. 50% wool, 50% polyester, 100% dapper. This tie was the starting point of the Temu order, everything else was filler to get the order up to the ¬£15 minimum checkout. Free stuff, considering he has previously paid more than ¬£15 for a tie of comparable quality. He wants it to work with his purple suit, as none of his other ties really do, in any kind of satisfying way. His purple paisley tie works fine, because it's purple, darker purple and tiny flecks of red and white. His navy knitted tie is an even less of an inspired match. On paper, this new tie of deep forest green isn't necessarily going to be a traditional colour match with purple, but the tartan has teal stripes, thin brown overlines and, importantly, lavender highlights. It is these that might make the purple/dark green a pleasant contrast, rather than an eyesore. Professional. Sartorial. 

For all that he is a very modern person, with many very modern interests, sensibilities, food requirements, and a modern vocation, Vernon is one of those people who want to have been born much earlier than they were, and will occasionally tell people this. He pulls this out when someone has cheered him up by asking him why he always dresses as smart as he does. He has decided the sweet-spot for his birth is somewhere after 1886, the year Karl Benz invented the last invention he considers indispensable: the motor car. Vernon cannot drive, even though he's thirty-two, so there's a plot-hole. He would find it easier not to be so lazy in the past. His daydream has to be selective though: he'd love to be bobbing about in 1920s London, but who can be bothered with all that World War One stuff? Conscription to France, muddy from your neck down in diphtheria-ridden trenches, not to mention getting bulleted to death. What he really wants is a multiverse hop, rather than just a skip backwards through this humanity's history. A universe where the Archduke Franz Ferdinand caught a debilitating flu that week, cancelled all his appointments, and everyone just waltzed into the '20s unaware of what could have been. Pretty rich that, though, wanting to erase a war, just so you could go partying. 

Vernon also won't say ‚Äî to anyone who he's telling this fantasy to ‚Äî that he'd need to be infinitely wealthy, but without celebrity. The Champagne Lifestyle, without anyone being bothered how he can afford it. Nor will he mention his worries about whether tubby five-foot-six ginger people with slight underbites even fared well back then ‚Äî he isn't sure his face fits here, where people are meant to be kinder. Didn't you very much need a beard, in the past? Vernon has tried beards to fix his weak chin, and long hair to fix the shape of his cranium, but he has promised himself never again; he'd looked like Noel Edmonds made from fudge. 

It would all just be simpler if he had a nice long and happy past life to regress into. Vernon scoffs at people who claim to have had a past life, but he does realise the motivation for his scoffing is sheer jealousy: he wouldn't need to daydream, and wouldn't have to drown his evenings in television reruns, if he could just sit back and tune into his past-self's memories. 

Vernon gets his purple suit out of the wardrobe, twists the hook on the hanger, and hangs it over the wardrobe door. Holding the tie against the suit, he realises he lacks objectivity; he wants to say the match is good, just as he did when he bought the tie. This test isn't confirming or denying anything. He needs to see beyond his desire for the pairing to work, to see if it does. There's only one thing for it: full immersion. Shedding the brown tweed suit and green check tie he has been wearing all day, noting that his shirt pits are a bit on the whiffy side as he does so, he puts on the purple suit and the tartan tie in question. 

Tilting the Argos Home Essentials Oak Effect Free Standing Cheval Mirror back from the vertical, he steps away, ready to behold his reflection. But instead of aesthetic triumph, his eye catches movement: a large brown spider, high upon the wall. It looms directly above his bed, doing spidery things with its legs  ‚Äî no doubt some cryptic semaphore for don't you dare. Vernon‚Äôs breath hitches. ‚ÄúAt least it's on the wall,‚Äù he thinks, as he pulls on his blue suedette slippers, so as to be suitably soled for the occupation of the impending murder, just in case he fluffs his first plan to squish it with a book and it becomes a stomping job. ""Alexa,"" he commands, ""shuffle my robot apocalypse playlist."" His heartbeat quickens as Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger starts. He grabs the thick book on his nightstand. His weapon of choice. 

Over the music, a blackbird trills a loud lament, and ‚Äî  was that a cricket?  A Glaswegian urban cricket? Weird, but it's not the critter Vernon feels he needs to give his attention to right now. 

Mounting the bed, he feels its treacherous instability beneath his feet. 

‚ÄúSmells nice up here ‚Äî 
fresh, like outdoorsy fresh.
‚ÄòOne spritz three days ago and your living room will smell like sunlit meadows and  wildflowers, without the awkward conversation with squirrels.‚Äô
This is no time to be a Febreze advert, Vernon,. ‚Äù 

Vernon has never had occasion to stand on his mattress before, let alone jump on it in order to put a book on top of a spider. It's a very unstable base of attack; it wobbles, it shifts. Still, he advances, book raised high, heart pounding the ancient rhythm of prey pretending they're the predator now. He curses his own height and the absurd height of his ceilings. He jumps, greasily, and unleashes his strike. In the elongated seconds of flight and overhand smash, his choice of handhold on the book becomes suddenly questionable.

The book slaps the wall unconvincingly, like a wet handshake. Vernon is far too concerned with jumping down from the bed deliberately ‚Äî and assuredly without the spider on him ‚Äî rather than falling off of it and the spider jumping after him ‚Äî to see if book did connect with spider. 

Vernon's dismount from the bed landed him in a green field of ankle-height grass. Instead of being beside his bed and in front of his wall with a spider or a spider-stain high up on it, he was experiencing a vista of purple and brown mottled hills and evening blue skies all around him, little oranging clouds scudding leftwards towards a setting sun. An early star shone in the navying east. He felt the late sun on the right side of his face, and a slight breeze playing around him. He heard the sound of a river and crickets somewhere, and smelt the smell of grass and a faint waft of manure. No more Daft Punk. He was not in his bedroom, flat, street, or even anywhere he has even seen before. For all it was all so full of everything, all this nature, objectively gorgeous in its arrangement of course, as pure nature generally tends to be, it was emptier than anywhere Vernon had ever seen before. Nobody and nothing. 

""Jangled?"" his brain asks. That can't be the right word. ""Abrupt!"" he heard his mind shout. ""Cracked!"" He shook his head and regretted it. He thought about turning around to see what might be behind him, but decided he had enough on his plate for now, with the little clouds and the hills and the grass and shrubs and those sheep over there, and that line of trees and everything. Was that a dragonfly? Another beat of the most unadulterated confusion, cooked from a very tangible roux of unreality baked with undeniable and unbearable reality all around and over him and going up his nose and squidging into his left slipper. 

""Did the spider do this?"" 

Vernon's vision swam and refocused, but that didn't help at all, he was still in this outside place, absolutely horrified at all its sickening beauty. He remembered feeling like this the one and only time he had been on a treadmill, that time there was one in the break-room at work, and he'd dismounted and spun into a stack of plastic chairs. He had managed not to black out that time though, the break-room still being around him and all. Now, every inexplicable photon hitting Vernon's retinas seemed to burn and blacken. The last thought Vernon had before he toppled stiffly into his first ever faint was just how many things he had to think about

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal sofa table behind a couch offers a blend of style, functionality, and durability. Understanding the key features to look for will help you make an informed decision that complements your d√©cor and meets your practical needs.

**Dimensions and Height:** A crucial aspect is the size of the sofa table. It should ‚Äãbe approximately the same length as your sofa, or slightly shorter, to maintain visual balance. The height ‚Äçis equally important; it should sit at or ‚Å§just‚Äã below‚Å¢ the back of your sofa. Aim for a height that allows easy access ‚Äãto items placed on the table without requiring you to reach awkwardly over the couch. A ‚Äçstandard height ranges from 28 to 32 inches, but measure your sofa‚Äç to ensure‚Äç the best fit.

**Material and Construction:** The‚Å§ material of the sofa table greatly impacts its durability and aesthetic appeal. Solid wood, such as oak, maple, or walnut, offers ‚Äårobustness and a timeless look,‚Äç though it can be more expensive. Engineered wood,like MDF or plywood,provides a cost-effective alternative while still offering decent strength. Metal frames, often made of steel‚Äã or iron, can add‚Å£ a modern or industrial touch and provide a sturdy base. The construction quality is also vital; look for well-joined seams, stable legs, and a smooth finish to ensure the table‚Äôs longevity.

**Storage Options:** Many sofa tables come with built-in storage features to enhance their functionality. These options can include open shelving, drawers, cabinets, or a combination of these. Open shelves are ideal for displaying books, decorative items, or storing baskets. Drawers offer concealed storage for smaller items like remote controls, chargers, or stationery. Cabinets provide more secure storage for items you want to keep out of sight. Evaluate your storage‚Å¢ needs to determine which type of storage options best suit your lifestyle.

**Style and‚Äå Design:** The style of the sofa table should complement your existing d√©cor. ‚Å¢Consider the overall ‚Å¢theme of your living room,whether‚Äå it is modern,customary,rustic,or eclectic. Clean lines,minimalist designs,and neutral colors work well in contemporary spaces,while ornate details,dark woods,and classic silhouettes suit traditional settings. Rustic styles‚Å§ often feature ‚Å¢reclaimed wood, distressed finishes, and industrial accents. Choose a‚Å£ sofa‚Äã table that‚Äç enhances the aesthetic appeal of your room and reflects your personal style.

**Weight Capacity:** The ‚Å£weight capacity of the sofa table is an important consideration, especially‚Å§ if you plan to place heavy items on it, such as lamps, large books, or decorative objects.‚Å§ Ensure the table is sturdy enough to support the intended‚Å¢ weight without wobbling or bending. Check the manufacturer's specifications for‚Äå the maximum weight capacity and factor in a‚Å§ safety margin to prevent overloading. Reinforcements like solid wood legs, metal supports, and durable joinery can contribute to a higher weight capacity.

**Surface Finish:** The finish of the sofa table not only contributes‚Äç to its aesthetic appeal but also affects its durability ‚Å£and maintenance. Common finishes include lacquer, varnish, paint, and stain.‚Å¢ Lacquer and varnish provide a protective layer that resists scratches, stains, and moisture. ‚Å£Paint offers a wide range of ‚Äçcolor options and can be used to create different effects, such as matte, gloss, or distressed finishes. Stain enhances the natural grain of the wood while offering some protection. Consider the level of maintenance required for each finish and choose one that suits your lifestyle and preferences.

Key‚Äã features of a well-designed sofa table include:

*   Durable and stable construction
*   Adequate storage space for various ‚Å£items
*   Aesthetic appeal that complements the room's ‚Äåd√©cor
*   Suitable dimensions to fit behind ‚Äåthe‚Å¢ couch

**Tech-savvy Homeowners:** ‚ÄåPeople who‚Äç use their living room as a hub for‚Äç entertainment and technology will benefit from having a sofa table behind ‚Å§the couch. It‚Å£ provides an ideal spot to charge electronic‚Äå devices,such‚Äå as smartphones,tablets,and laptops,keeping them within easy reach. The table can ‚Äåalso accommodate a lamp‚Äå for ambient lighting, creating a cozy‚Äå atmosphere for watching movies or playing video games. The streamlined ‚Äådesign complements modern technology beautifully.

**Families with Young Children:** ‚ÄåFamilies with young children often struggle to keep their living‚Å§ room tidy. A sofa table behind the couch offers a practical solution for storing toys, books, and other ‚Å§kid-related items, helping to maintain a more organized and visually appealing space.

Through the curved glass windows of the schooner‚Äôs small but elegant stern gallery, our wake stretches over a vast expanse sparkling blue sea. I should be making entries in the log, but the splendid sunset keeps drawing my attention from its pages. 

Then I see the French Frigate, the Pellier, swing into view as she yaws half a mile off our quarter. The sudden turn points her broadside at our stern, all twenty-four of her gun ports open wide. 

Oh, right; we‚Äôre still under attack. 

My mind loses all meditative expression, and in disappointment I reach for my coffee as the Pellier‚Äôs side vanishes behind a cloud of orange-punched smoke. A moment later comes the thundering crash of her guns, white plumes dotting across our wake where her roundshot strikes the sea, just short of our fleeing schooner. 

One lucky shot bounces off the waves and comes aboard, smashing the cabin windows and shattering the coffee cup in my hand. 

‚ÄúMiss Dangerfield,‚Äù I say, in a voice calculated to penetrate the entire vessel. 

‚ÄúSir?‚Äù Says my steward, her concerned face appearing at the cabin door. Her eyes immediately notice the rustled tablecloth and askew silver dishes, and her expression turns somewhat accusatory. 

As if I‚Äôd personally invited an 18-pound ball aboard at one thousand feet per second. 

‚ÄúAnother cup of you please, ma‚Äôam, thank you,‚Äù I say, as politely as I can manage. 

She salutes sullenly‚Ä¶sarcastically? No, no, she wouldn‚Äôt dare, and vanishes into the galley. 

We‚Äôd have never allowed these insolent looks in the Navy, I reflect. For a moment I gleefully imagine her bare back strapped to the grating, taking half a dozen stripes for insubordination. 

But I‚Äôm no longer part of the Royal Fleet; I‚Äôm a smuggler, and the rules are different now. As captain and part-owner of the schooner, I maintain the same rigid authority, but the crew are volunteers and professional seamen, much less concerned with formalities than your by-the-book man-o-war crews. 

The coffee comes back hot and strong. I drink a few grateful gulps, then fill my cup‚Äîa metal cup, I notice‚Äîand head up on deck. I note with satisfaction that the Frigate had continued to wear and was now pointing away south. 

Mr Blythe turns away from the taffrail when I approach, and scurries over to me. He‚Äôs an odd, squirrelly fellow we picked up in Port Mahon, said he needed a quiet passage, no papers. Adding in the fact that he‚Äôs a Spaniard, speaks Latin, and wears all black; he might as well have the word ‚ÄúAssassin‚Äù tattooed on his forehead. 

He makes me extraordinarily uncomfortable.  

I open my telescope and pretend to focus on a flock of seagulls off our starboard beam, hoping he‚Äôll turn away. 

‚ÄúNot expecting more trouble, Captain?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot presently,‚Äù I said, ‚Äústill - I better go have a look from the masthead.‚Äù 

Slinging my telescope, I spring onto the rigging and scramble aloft like a prime foremast hand. 

The platform at the topmast is crowded: three sailors. The lookout and two off-duty hands, seated on folded piles of sailcloth. I hear the clatter of dice, and one of them scoops something into his mouth. 

All wear guilty expressions; they weren‚Äôt expecting anyone, much less the captain, and even smuggling ships have rules against gambling. 

But I‚Äôm no longer in the mood to flog anyone, and regardless all attention shifts at cries from the deck below: 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that lubber doing? He‚Äôll kill himself!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll break his neck, damn fool!‚Äù 

Glancing over the edge I see Mr. Blythe entangled the rigging. He‚Äôd tried to follow me up, the pragmatical bastard! He slips again and hangs inverted, swinging by his ankles with the roll of the mast. His face shows pure horror. 

Fortunately Miss Dangerfield chose that moment to ascend the opposite rigging with my refreshments, making the climb look easy despite being encumbered by a steaming kettle and silver cigar case. 

She hangs these on a rat line, and leaps for a backstay, swinging across the mast to the rigging with it‚Äôs precarious hold on the assassin. Seizing him by the ankle, she jerks him free and upright and carries him the rest of the way aloft, dumping him in a gasping heap on our platform. 

‚ÄúSir!‚Äù Says the lookout, pointing to the French ship which was now almost disappearing from view, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre flying an alphabetical message.‚Äù 

I focus the eyepiece of my telescope, and the Pelliere springs into view. With her studdingsails abroad and royals she makes a glorious sight on the water. I spell out the flags as they break out on her mizzen top: 

‚ÄúH-A-V-E A N-I-C-E T-R-I-P‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs truly nice of them, Captain,‚Äù says Miss Dangerfield. 

‚ÄúIndeed it is!‚Äù I say, and then ‚ÄúPass the word for our signalmen. You sir: spell out ‚ÄúY-O-U A-S W-E-L-L.‚Äù 

I reach to pick up Mr. Blythe, supporting him beneath his shoulder. ‚ÄúOpen your eyes, Mr. Blythe. The view is quite stunning from here.‚Äù 

Reluctantly he lets them focus. Then his face brightens into something almost like happiness, and he gives a reptilian smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm amazed!‚Äù He says. ‚ÄúAmazed!‚Äù 

‚ÄúTake my glass,‚Äù I say, unsure of why I no longer despise the fellow, ‚Äújust don‚Äôt drop it. There - to the starboard ‚Ä¶ no, to starboard ‚Ä¶there you are sir ‚Ä¶ you can make out the western tip of Formentera.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIncredible!‚Äù He says, whimsically sweeping the telescope in a slow circle of the horizon. 

The tea finally comes up, and I light a cigar. This is the type of sailing I love. 

Blythe suddenly freezes, the glass pointing straight ahead inline with our bow. 

‚ÄúAnd captain‚Ä¶what are those sleek, shiny vessels cruising with such graceful speed around the cliffs there?‚Äù 

It‚Äôs as I feared. We‚Äôd dodged the French Empire, sure, but we‚Äôre small fish for them. It‚Äôs different for these local harbor cops with their ocean flyers: this is all they do. 

‚ÄúBaltimore Clippers,‚Äù I say, without needing to look. I flick my cigar and watch it soar away and fizzle into the ocean. ‚ÄúRevenue Cutters.‚Äù

## Key Features Analysis

The features of a cup and straw set determine its functionality, durability, and overall user experience.

**Material:** The material of the cup and straw impacts not only the feel but also the durability and environmental impact. Stainless steel is a popular choice for its durability and resistance to rust, capable of lasting years with proper care. Glass offers a pure taste and is also recyclable. Plastic, while lightweight and often more affordable, raises environmental concerns, although BPA-free options are common. silicone is a flexible and heat-resistant option frequently enough used for kids' cups and straws. Reusable bamboo constitutes an emerging material option that boasts sustainability as its key attribute.The selection of your cup and straw set‚Äôs material should hinge upon priorities ranging from the cup‚Äôs resilience, material safety, eco-friendliness, and aesthetic appeal.

**Insulation:** If you frequently enjoy hot or cold beverages, insulation is a crucial feature. Double-walled insulation, frequently enough found in stainless steel tumblers, helps maintain the temperature of your drink for longer periods. This prevents condensation on the outside of the cup and keeps your hands comfortable. Vacuum insulation is the most effective, creating a barrier that minimizes heat transfer.some insulated cups can keep drinks hot for up to 12 hours or cold for up to 24 hours.

Double walled glass or plastic may provide rudimentary levels of insulation; however, it will not compete with metal options.

**lid Design:** The lid is a critical component for preventing spills and ensuring easy sipping. Look for lids that are leak-proof or spill-resistant, especially if you plan to use the cup on the go. Some lids feature a sliding closure to seal the straw opening when not in use. Securely fitting lids are essential for preventing messes, especially with hot liquids. Consider lids that are easy to clean and disassemble to prevent bacteria buildup.

Lids can be made from plastic, silicone, or stainless steel, depending on the overall set design.

**Straw Type and Size:** Straws come in various materials, including stainless steel, glass, silicone, and plastic. Stainless steel straws are durable and reusable but can sometimes transfer a metallic taste. Silicone straws are flexible and gentle on teeth but might potentially be more prone to staining. The straw size should be appropriate for the type of beverage you'll be drinking. A wider straw is better for smoothies and milkshakes, while a narrower straw is suitable for water or juice.

Some sets include multiple straws to accommodate different beverages, or even bends in the straw that enable comfortable drinking in various positions.

**Capacity and Portability:** The size of the cup should align with your drinking habits and intended use. Smaller cups (12-16 ounces) are ideal for coffee or tea, while larger tumblers (20-30 ounces) are better for staying hydrated throughout the day. Consider the cup's dimensions and weight if you plan to carry it in a bag or backpack. Some cups are designed with a tapered shape to fit comfortably in car cup holders.

The portability of the cup should factor into your decision, particularly if you intend to use them while taking public transportation or performing other actions that require both hands.

## Core Benefits

A well-chosen cup and straw set offer significant advantages in terms of convenience, sustainability, and overall enjoyment.

**Reduced Plastic Waste:** By switching to a reusable cup and straw, you can significantly reduce your consumption of single-use plastics. Millions of plastic straws and cups end up in landfills and oceans each year, contributing to pollution and harming wildlife.

Through the curved glass windows of the schooner‚Äôs small but elegant stern gallery, our wake stretches over a vast expanse sparkling blue sea. I should be making entries in the log, but the splendid sunset keeps drawing my attention from its pages. 

Then I see the French Frigate, the Pellier, swing into view as she yaws half a mile off our quarter. The sudden turn points her broadside at our stern, all twenty-four of her gun ports open wide. 

Oh, right; we‚Äôre still under attack. 

My mind loses all meditative expression, and in disappointment I reach for my coffee as the Pellier‚Äôs side vanishes behind a cloud of orange-punched smoke. A moment later comes the thundering crash of her guns, white plumes dotting across our wake where her roundshot strikes the sea, just short of our fleeing schooner. 

One lucky shot bounces off the waves and comes aboard, smashing the cabin windows and shattering the coffee cup in my hand. 

‚ÄúMiss Dangerfield,‚Äù I say, in a voice calculated to penetrate the entire vessel. 

‚ÄúSir?‚Äù Says my steward, her concerned face appearing at the cabin door. Her eyes immediately notice the rustled tablecloth and askew silver dishes, and her expression turns somewhat accusatory. 

As if I‚Äôd personally invited an 18-pound ball aboard at one thousand feet per second. 

‚ÄúAnother cup of you please, ma‚Äôam, thank you,‚Äù I say, as politely as I can manage. 

She salutes sullenly‚Ä¶sarcastically? No, no, she wouldn‚Äôt dare, and vanishes into the galley. 

We‚Äôd have never allowed these insolent looks in the Navy, I reflect. For a moment I gleefully imagine her bare back strapped to the grating, taking half a dozen stripes for insubordination. 

But I‚Äôm no longer part of the Royal Fleet; I‚Äôm a smuggler, and the rules are different now. As captain and part-owner of the schooner, I maintain the same rigid authority, but the crew are volunteers and professional seamen, much less concerned with formalities than your by-the-book man-o-war crews. 

The coffee comes back hot and strong. I drink a few grateful gulps, then fill my cup‚Äîa metal cup, I notice‚Äîand head up on deck. I note with satisfaction that the Frigate had continued to wear and was now pointing away south. 

Mr Blythe turns away from the taffrail when I approach, and scurries over to me. He‚Äôs an odd, squirrelly fellow we picked up in Port Mahon, said he needed a quiet passage, no papers. Adding in the fact that he‚Äôs a Spaniard, speaks Latin, and wears all black; he might as well have the word ‚ÄúAssassin‚Äù tattooed on his forehead. 

He makes me extraordinarily uncomfortable.  

I open my telescope and pretend to focus on a flock of seagulls off our starboard beam, hoping he‚Äôll turn away. 

‚ÄúNot expecting more trouble, Captain?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNot presently,‚Äù I said, ‚Äústill - I better go have a look from the masthead.‚Äù 

Slinging my telescope, I spring onto the rigging and scramble aloft like a prime foremast hand. 

The platform at the topmast is crowded: three sailors. The lookout and two off-duty hands, seated on folded piles of sailcloth. I hear the clatter of dice, and one of them scoops something into his mouth. 

All wear guilty expressions; they weren‚Äôt expecting anyone, much less the captain, and even smuggling ships have rules against gambling. 

But I‚Äôm no longer in the mood to flog anyone, and regardless all attention shifts at cries from the deck below: 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he doing? He‚Äôll kill himself!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôll break his neck, damn fool!‚Äù 

Glancing over the edge I see Mr. Blythe entangled the rigging. He‚Äôd tried to follow me up, the pragmatical bastard! He slips again and hangs inverted, swinging by his ankles with the roll of the mast. His face shows pure horror. 

Fortunately Miss Dangerfield chose that moment to ascend the opposite rigging with my refreshments, somehow making the climb encumbered by a steaming kettle of tea and my silver cigar case.

She hangs these on a rat line, and leaps for a backstay, swinging across the mast to the rigging with it‚Äôs precarious hold on the assassin. Seizing him by the ankle, she jerks him free and upright and carries him the rest of the way aloft, dumping him in a gasping heap on our platform. 

‚ÄúSir!‚Äù Says the lookout, pointing to the French ship which was now almost disappearing from view, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre flying an alphabetical message.‚Äù 

I focus the eyepiece of my telescope, and the Pelliere springs into view. With her studdingsails abroad and royals she makes a glorious sight on the water. I spell out the flags as they break out on her mizzen top: 

‚ÄúH-A-V-E A N-I-C-E T-R-I-P‚Äù 

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs truly nice of them, Captain,‚Äù says Miss Dangerfield. 

‚ÄúIndeed it is!‚Äù I say, and then ‚ÄúPass the word for our signalmen. You sir: spell out ‚ÄúY-O-U A-S W-E-L-L.‚Äù 

I reach to pick up Mr. Blythe, supporting him beneath his shoulder. ‚ÄúOpen your eyes, Mr. Blythe. The view is quite stunning from here.‚Äù 

Reluctantly he lets them focus. Then his face brightens into something almost like happiness, and he gives a reptilian smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm amazed!‚Äù He says. ‚ÄúAmazed!‚Äù 

‚ÄúTake my glass,‚Äù I say, unsure of why I no longer despise the fellow, ‚Äújust don‚Äôt drop it. There - to the starboard ‚Ä¶ no, to starboard ‚Ä¶there you are sir ‚Ä¶ you can make out the western tip of Formentera.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIncredible!‚Äù He says, whimsically sweeping the telescope in a slow circle of the horizon. 

The tea finally comes up, and I light a cigar. This is the type of sailing I love. 

Blythe suddenly freezes, the glass pointing straight ahead inline with our bow. 

‚ÄúAnd captain‚Ä¶what are those sleek, shiny vessels cruising with such graceful speed around the cliffs there?‚Äù 

It was as I feared. We‚Äôd dodged the French Empire, sure, but we‚Äôre small fish for them. It‚Äôs different for these local harbor cops with their ocean flyers: this is all they do. 

‚ÄúBaltimore Clippers,‚Äù I say, without needing to look. I flicked my cigar and watched it soar away and fizzle into the ocean. ‚ÄúRevenue Cutters.‚Äù
