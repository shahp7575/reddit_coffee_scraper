That‚Äôs where this little daydream begins.

I was wandering through the shelves, not looking for anything in particular, just enjoying the quiet. That‚Äôs when I saw you. You were seated at one of the study tables, or maybe standing by the fiction section, flipping through a novel.

I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how engrossed you were, how natural you looked in this space. For a while, I stayed in my corner, pretending to look at books but stealing glances at you. Finally, I worked up the courage to approach.

I said something like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great book. If you‚Äôre into this genre, I know another one you might love.‚Äù

And that‚Äôs where our story begins. What happens next? That‚Äôs up to us to write together.

If this kind of slow, quiet connection appeals to you, I‚Äôm looking for a Female Roleplay Partner to bring this scene to life. We can build on this idea, add our own twists, and see where it goes.

About me: I‚Äôm 28, a nature lover with a passion for books, fitness, and exploring cozy little spaces like libraries and coffee shops. I value creativity and respect boundaries, and I want this to be fun for both of us.

If this post speaks to you, send me a chat request! Let‚Äôs craft a story that feels like it could really happen.

I have been visiting you beautiful country for 10 days and it's really a very nice country.

I am a Palestinian who lives in Germany and who married a Tunisian woman who also grew up in Germany.

So since on Tuesday there was a Holiday about the start of the revolution I have felt a lot of remorse when people where talking about it.


We have been staying with her family who aren't that well of financialy and they were all talking how they missed Ben Ali. And how everything went to bad since the Revolution. How everything became more expensive and the jobs are less. Which I get revolutions always have a downside. But at first I would only talk to older people her aunt's and oncels, so I thought maybe it is just a reaction of older people. So I went out with her cousin and his friends to a Coffee. I also asked them and they were also filled with remorse and missed Ben Ali, those were the people who went to the streets during the revolution. So this kind of shocked me, so I asked further if any of them, do see any improvement since the Revolution. They can't recall any way there life got better since the Revolution.

So it could be that poorer people are the one who pay the biggest price for the revolution. Or is this something that is shared in every economic class?

Are there any winners of the revolution? what I mean with this ist, a group of people who got more rights because this, a minority group, women or maybe a class that got a better economical situation because of the revolution.

Have you noticed postive things about the revolution?",1,1734638944.0,Tunisia,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs dead. 

Without the office workers back in the city, many of these will go out of business. It‚Äôs also nice in general to have the city hustling and bustling. 

It‚Äôs clear also how many people abuse their WFH privileges. We all know they‚Äôre not really working as hard. ",0,1734638787.0,sanfrancisco,3,0.2,False

I felt awkward and didn't know what to say. So I just quietly said ""thanks"". He clearly felt awkward too because he avoided eye contact and ran away after saying it lol 

I usually only get hit on by old geriatric men or receive vulgar comments. So it was nice to get a compliment from someone who seemed genuine. 

Idk if I have body dysmorphia because I had another creepy old man hit on me later in the day. But I feel so ugly all the time. I had a bunch of bad plastic surgery and fillers. And I just feel so bad about myself all the time ",1,1734638758.0,BenignExistence,0,1.0,False

Hello   
I bought the Phillips 5500 machine 3 days ago   
I adjusted the grinder to the level in the picture and I brewed some double shots  
The pucks are still so inconsistent and watery as displayed in  the second image  
The first day I used a blonde roast beans but then I switched to medium roasted ones which you can see in the screen

I don't want to come off as a whiny doomer but what do I do. Sure I will keep applying but my savings don't care that I sent out 5 apps today. I started by doing my work at coffee shops but I stopped being able to justify the expense. I have been eating rice and frozen vegetables and it feels like I am trying to weather a storm.

My biggest problem might be that I am still trying to figure out what industry I want to go into. When I graduated i thought this would be fine because I would just figure it out as I gained job experience. But there is no job and all I am experiencing is despair.

The special request meals are served first, and there can be a 10-30min delay before regular service. So you are given your tray with the hot food, but then have to wait a while for drinks/coffee/tea.

Most of the time you'll also see them go around first putting stickers on the seats with special requests, so they know who to serve and don't need to ask. It'd be very easy to combine the 2 meal services.",0,1734638169.0,travel,6,0.13,False

1hi1hlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1hi1hlp/how_do_i_get_over_this_situationship/,How do I get over this situationship? ,"Hey I‚Äôm here asking for advice because I‚Äôm really not sure what to do.

I‚Äôm a 26M, and about two months ago, I started talking to a 25F shortly after I had a surgery. Around the same time, I started my first job, and honestly, everything felt like it was going perfectly‚Äîlike I was living in a dream.

She told me early on that she‚Äôd broken up with someone over the summer but was interested in getting to know me. She said she wanted to take things slow, which I completely respected.

We met three times in total, but nothing romantic happened‚Äînot even a kiss‚Äîbecause I was respecting her boundaries. I figured she would let me know when the time was right.

After our third date, she told me she didn‚Äôt like how I wasn‚Äôt taking action or showing enough confidence. I didn‚Äôt really expect this because I thought I was doing the right thing by being patient. We argued about it but eventually worked things out, or so I thought.

A few days later, I asked her to grab coffee, but she said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the sweetest guy I‚Äôve met, but to have something more, I need to feel something else.‚Äù I was upset because I didn‚Äôt even get a chance to show the ‚Äúconfident‚Äù side she wanted, and I asked if we could talk in person. Instead, we ended things that night over text.

The next day, I messaged her again, and we argued. I said some mean things in the heat of the moment (not my proudest moment, I know). A few days later, I felt terrible about what I said and messaged her to apologize because I‚Äôm not that kind of person and wanted to end things on a good note.

We had a calm, honest conversation, which was the best part of the whole situation. We both said how we felt without any anger. I asked if we could at least stay friends, but she said that wouldn‚Äôt be good for me right now.

Now it‚Äôs been over a week, and I feel just  ‚Äúwhat could have been‚Äù scenarios keep playing in my head, I keep having the urge to message her and I don't know what to do. 

Thanks for reading this far, and sorry for any grammar mistakes.

TL;DR:
Started talking to a girl after my surgery, everything seemed great. She wanted to take it slow, but after three dates, she told me I wasn‚Äôt confident enough and broke things off. I got upset and said some things I regret but later apologized, and we ended on good terms. She said we couldn‚Äôt even be friends for now, and a week later, I‚Äôm stuck on ‚Äúwhat could have been.‚Äù Struggling to move on and need advice.

#1: ‚ÄúWerewolves of Cedar Bluff‚Äù 
In this story, I will have two main characters: Julia Darling (who is a descendent and non-participating member of the Ironhide Pack) and Demetri Remes (who is a sentinel in the Ironhide Pack). I'd prefer a partner who's willing to play potential love interests for both characters.¬†
Both main characters must be over the age of 20. This story takes place in an alternate universe based loosely on Cedar Bluff, Virginia; you‚Äôre welcome to make up and stores/street names/scenery/etc.¬†
In order to keep the story progressing/subplots unfolding, I'd like for both of us to have several side characters¬†in both packs.¬†

Synopsis: A member of the Ironhide pack has been murdered and all evidence points to (Your Pack Name). Julia Darling returns to the family pack to pay her respects to an elderly uncle, only to be unwittingly roped into a lengthy investigation involving an enemy pack. Tensions between the two packs have been high for over a millenia, with both fighting for ownership of Moon Peak mountain territory. To settle the matter, a meeting between the two packs has been called - but, talk of war threatens to undermine any efforts toward a peaceful solution.¬†
Meanwhile, Demetri Remes is tasked to infiltrate (Your Pack Name) with a false identity to gather more information regarding both the recent death and plans of war.¬†

‚ÄúJules, honey, it‚Äôs your mother. I‚Äôm calling from Aunt Margaret‚Äôs phone because mine‚Äôs bit the dust;¬†a nasty accident with the garbage disposal. I can‚Äôt get the goshdarn phone company to send me a new one, they¬†want¬†me to drive all the way out to Brandon to¬†speak with one of their ‚Äògeniuses.‚Äô How are ya, honey? Geez-louise, it‚Äôs been, what, a month, two months since we talked face to face?‚Äù

Julia stared down at the screen of her phone and inwardly cringed at the closeup of her mother‚Äôs nostrils displayed where her entire face should have been. ‚ÄúMom, you‚Äôre holding the phone too close - I can‚Äôt see you well.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell, I can see you. Listen, I‚Äôm calling because something‚Äôs happened. I really hate to be telling you this over the phone.‚Äù There was a pause, followed by a quiet cough, and a¬† slight shift of the phone angle to include her mother‚Äôs light brown eyes behind thick-rimmed glasses. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no easy way to say it. Uncle Henry was found... dead this morning. They found him just outside of his house; Lord above, it was awful. He was sprawled out along the front porch with deep gashes in his chest and back... like he‚Äôd been clawed to death. We‚Äôre having a service for him this Friday. You gotta come home, honey.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight. Yeah, of course.‚Äù Julia agreed quickly, the shock evident in her voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take off work-‚Äú

‚ÄúGood, your father will be so happy to hear that. We‚Äôre all a mess right now, it‚Äôll be nice to have you back home. I want you to be careful, Jules. There‚Äôs talk that (Insert Pack Name) might have been involved in this... Don‚Äôt go out anywhere by yourself, and stay away from the downtown area. I love ya, honey. Let me get off the phone now, I‚Äôve gotta call your Aunt Lena next.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, mom, I love you too. I‚Äôll talk to you later‚Äù¬†

‚Ä¶

The chill of the morning air stung against Julia‚Äôs skin and tinted her cheeks a light pink, as she exited her boyfriend‚Äôs silver Subaru Solterra. She was a striking beauty - tall and slender with a cool olive complexion and thick, jet black curls that spilled over her shoulders in loose ringlets. Her large eyes sparkled like two endless emerald pools between long, dark lashes; beneath which positioned in perfect symmetry: a thin, slightly upturned nose and a pair of bow-shaped lips tinted the same color as her cheeks. 

A few inches of snow had fallen overnight, blanketing the woodland surroundings under a bright sheet of white; it was a beautiful, scenic view that reminded her of one night in particular; or, more specifically, of him.¬†He, the phantom of her mind, no more than a distant memory, had impressed upon her body an indelible mark under the light of the¬†full moon. It had been a year since they last met in secret, but she still remembered his scent-¬†
He reminded her of Christmas, a woody mixture of pine and maple, with subtle, peppery tones and a splash of bourbon. They‚Äôd met during her run through the forests of Moon Peak mountain, back when she was convinced that the cold night air would dispel the effects of her curse; or otherwise quell the cry of her instincts. He had chased her for miles down winding paths, over springs, past caves, and under the overgrown tree roots. The thrill of the chase, the cold night air, the sweet smell of pine, and the heightened sense of freedom under the moonlight swirled into a potent cocktail - one that Julia surrendered to dizzily, as she was pushed to the ground. There were no words, no introductions, no explanation for their actions outside of what felt right. He had kissed her with the burning passion of a thousand suns, and left before she had the chance to catch her breath. She‚Äôd watched as his back disappeared into the night, leaving her alone to question the reality of the situation. Had she imagined him? All she could recall were his eyes and his scent - they haunted her dreams and tormented her endlessly.¬†

‚ÄúSo, this is your parents‚Äô house?‚Äù Lloyd asked, breaking Julia‚Äôs thoughts, as he rounded the vehicle to join where she stood. He was a goofy-looking guy, no taller than 5‚Äô10, with a pair of hazel eyes, an aquiline nose, and a balding head of dark brown hair. They‚Äôd met at Pinebrook Elementary School, where they both worked as second grade teachers; and, well, she‚Äôd found his personality nice enough. He was kind, a little talkative, funny, and not entirely off-putting. But, most importantly, he was human. Julia had grown up hating the bureaucracy of the pack, resenting her life as a creature, and wanting nothing to do with any of it; all she wanted was a sense of normality. Her life in the city provided that, and so did Lloyd. Sort of.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, kind of. It‚Äôs the family house,‚Äù she explained vaguely and buried her cold hands into the front pockets of her oversized sweater.¬†

‚ÄúJules! Oh, look at you, honey!‚Äù Her mom practically screeched, as the front door swung open to reveal several family members gathered near the porch.¬†

Julia beamed and rushed to greet her mother with a warm hug, only to be suffocated, pushed away, and assaulted by a pair of hands that squished her cheeks affectionately.¬†
‚ÄúYou get prettier every time¬†I see you. I wish you would let me set you up with-‚Äú Before she could finish her sentence, her gaze shifted to the awkward- looking man stationed near the car.¬†

‚ÄúOh, uh, mom, this is my boyfriend Lloyd.‚Äù Julia spoke with a breath of a laugh. ‚ÄúLloyd, this is my mom Patricia.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúA pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Patricia!‚Äù Lloyd spoke eagerly with a hand extended toward the short, slightly obese woman.¬†

‚ÄúWell, goody.‚Äù Patricia accepted the handshake politely and gave the young man a curious look down, before glancing over her shoulder toward her mountain of a husband who now stood only twenty feet away from the small group. ‚ÄúCharles, come and meet our daughter‚Äôs boyfriend.‚Äù¬†

Charles took another few steps forward and seized Lloyd‚Äôs smaller, somewhat clammy hand and gave it a forceful shake. ‚ÄúPleasure to meet ya, Floyd.‚Äù

‚ÄúDad, it‚Äôs Lloyd.‚Äù Julia corrected him in a whisper.

‚ÄúHow long have you been dating my daughter, Loin?‚Äù

‚ÄúLloyd‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I think it‚Äôs been about six months now,‚Äù Lloyd answered with a flash of his pearly whites. He seemed entirely unbothered by the elder‚Äôs failure to grasp his name, but a little uncomfortable with the grip upon his hand. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs told me so much about you.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúReally? She hasn‚Äôt mentioned you once to me,‚Äù Charles admitted with a playful wink in his daughter‚Äôs direction. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only messing with you, Floyd.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLloyd.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCome on inside. Would ya like something warm to drink, Floyd?‚Äù Patricia asked, as she corralled the couple through the front door.

‚ÄúLloyd.‚Äù

Lloyd stepped through the doorway and was surprised to find a gathering of thirty or more people all situated within a large living area directly to his left. They must have been there for the funeral; or so he figured, as Mr and Mrs. Darling proceeded to introduce him as ‚ÄòJulia‚Äôs new beau Floyd.‚Äô¬†

Demetri looked up from where he sat comfortably within a plush leather recliner with one leg crossed broadly over the other. He was a ruggedly handsome man with a mop of sandy blonde locks presently slicked back for the formal occasion, a pair of grey-blue eyes set beneath strong brows, a straight nose, and a jawline sharp enough to cut paper. Like most of the people present, he wore a black suit and tie, with the knot noticeably loosened, and his collar folded improperly. He picked at the burron near the wrist of his jacket and watched the couple with a look that read, in unmistakable detail, his disapproval of the match.¬†

While Julia went down the line of people, Demetri glanced toward a cousin that stood closest to the opposite window. He made a motion of two fingers against his lips, which was met with a discreet nod.¬†

‚ÄúDemetri!‚Äù Julia called out to the man before he could sneak away.¬†

‚ÄúHey, Jules. Floyd. How‚Äôve you been?‚Äù He asked with a thin line of a smile.¬†

‚ÄúGreat. I‚Äôve been great,‚Äù the dark haired woman spoke distractedly and turned to face the sound of her mother‚Äôs voice that echoed from the attaching room. 

‚ÄúJules, come and help me with these drinks, will ya?‚Äù

‚ÄúComing! Demetri, can you show Lloyd around for me? Maybe introduce him to the guys?‚Äù Julia suggested hopefully.¬†

#2: ‚ÄúAs you wish‚Äù 

Synopsis: YC is the struggling owner of a small restaurant in the city of (your choice.) After spending a majority of her life with her family in the countryside, YC decided the quiet life wasn‚Äôt for her. She had ambitions to make it big in the city with a restaurant of her own. 
Unfortunately for her, those ambitions weren‚Äôt working out like expected. Bills started piling up to the point where YC was looking at bankruptcy within the next two months.
MC is a Fae of Raderring Forest. After being saved from an enchanted snare by YC in their youth, he vowed to repay her kindness with whatever she wished. 
Now that YC is of age, MC appears, ready and willing to fulfill his end of the deal. But, will YC remember what she asked for all those years ago? - and, more importantly, is she ready to accept the wish she made as a child? 

Starter:

We were very young then, when the world grew cold and the ground was covered in new frost. A howling wind led me to you there beneath the stars. I heard your voice among trembling leaves, the pipe-d song of a happy child; I wished then, more than anything, to taste that happiness for myself; and, selfishly, to keep it for all eternity. 
I saw you first, before you saw me. I was like the fading greens of the forest, a shadow against the backdrop of night. You watched the stars and I watched you: you, so full of careless wonder at the world all around you; and, I, oblivious to the trap laid before me. I fell within the tangled arms of magic, a spell that I was then too weak to break. It held me against the ground and would leave me there to die, or else to meet its author; but, you saw me, didn‚Äôt you? You, stupid child, reached in without a second thought to pull me from its netting. 

‚ÄúYou are so small!‚Äù 

That is what you said to me. 

‚ÄúThe world is large; compared to it, who is not?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou talk funny. What are you?‚Äù 

Do you remember? I told you that I was like the night - the distant sky - and the creeping shadows. You did not understand this saying, of course. 

‚ÄúYou have saved my life. I am young still, but I am not without some strength. Tell me what it is - whatever it is - which you most desire in this world, and I will grant it you, according to my abilities.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI wish to marry a prince and become a princess!‚Äù 

How was I to fulfill this wish? Nevertheless, I am a man of my word. I promised you as much; I would have promised you much more, but this was what you chose. 

‚ÄúVery well. I will find you after fifteen years have passed, when you are of age to marry. At that time, I will fulfill your wish.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWill I have a palace? A princess dress? A tiara?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat is a princess without a palace, a princess dress, and tiara?‚Äù 

You were a very silly child. I might have taken your name for myself - and your happiness, as was my intention. But, I could not fulfill my promise if I did.
And, as I said, I am a man of my word. 

.~. 

‚ÄúWelcome! One moment, I‚Äôll be right with you! You can have a seat anywhere!‚Äù Kristen chirped reflexively at the sound of the door chime. An answer of some sort usually came at her greeting - an ‚Äòokay‚Äô or ‚Äòsure, thanks.‚Äô She waited for either of those answers while she finished rolling silverware; and, when no answer came, nor any indication of movement, she looked over her shoulder to glimpse the quiet patron.
His appearance was startling. He was tall - very tall, with a glowing countenance; something about him glittered impossibly, and marked his existence with an air of false transparency. His eyes were wild, blue, and framed beneath thick lashes; and his hair fell down to his waist in long, ink-black waves. What skin was exposed appeared tanned in complexion, with few traces of white markings along his neck; these strange symbols disappeared beneath the high collar of his - coat? Was it a coat? Kristen had never seen fashion like his before. 
She gasped despite herself, but recovered quickly with a firm brush of her hands against the front of her black apron. 
‚ÄúYou must not have heard me over the rain-‚Äú she excused his manners with a charming smile. ‚Äú-right this way, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere is the owner?‚Äù He answered shortly in an accent she could not quite place. 

‚ÄúOh - uhm, she‚Äôs in the kitchen. Is there something I can help you with? I am the -‚Äú

‚ÄúI will talk with the owner.‚Äù His gaze lowered from her face - presumably to her name tag, which she fiddled with anxiously.  
‚ÄúKristen.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAh. Okay. I‚Äôll just -‚Äú She bumped against the side of the host stand in her haste to do as he asked, and nearly tripped over her clumsy footing.
‚Äú-I‚Äôll get her. One second!‚Äù 

Kristen held her breath until she could no longer feel his gaze upon the back of her head. Once safely behind the wall dividing the front of the house from the back, she leaned against the freshly washed countertop and looked for (YC‚Äôs name) among the busy bodies. 
‚ÄúHey, (YC‚Äôs name)! There‚Äôs someone who wants to talk to you out front. Some tall guy with long hair? Didn‚Äôt catch his name. Said he‚Äôd only talk to you.‚Äù

#3: ‚ÄúThey serve coffee in hell‚Äù 

Synopsis: MC wakes up one day in a ‚Äúhell world‚Äù where he is forced to carve out a life for himself among the strange and unusual. 
YC can be anyone from a new coworker to a customer, etc - human or not. 

Alexander Barker never considered himself extraordinarily evil; he was, in most ways, a normal, upstanding citizen who paid his taxes on time, donated to charitable causes, helped when his friends moved, called his parents frequently, gave the old lady his seat on the subway, and always returned the shopping cart to its stall. 
Of course, he would never call himself a saint - he certainly had his moments, but who didn‚Äôt?  His job at the call center served as ample opportunity for evil fantasies - which often followed him home where he was ‚Ä¶ less than friendly with the neighbors in his small, crowded, and rundown apartment building. But, then again, his unpleasantness was limited to curt intersections, passive-aggressive notes on doors, and the refusal to attend even one ‚Äòcommunity BBQ.' It wasn‚Äôt like he slashed tires or screamed at the old bat across the hall or even reached through the phone to strangle that one guy who just wouldn‚Äôt understand that he didn‚Äôt set the subscription prices - 

-So, what the hell had he done to warrant THIS? 
This was a question he had asked himself every day for the past three years. 
Every morning started the same now: 

Alexander Barker, aged 28, would tie a black apron around his waist, and carry several large canisters out of a large walk-in freezer; he would then spend the next thirty minutes fighting with piece of crap coffee machines, arranging pastries in glass cabinets, and wiping fruitlessly at the perpetually sticky surface of linoleum countertops. 

After which, he would unlock the front door, flip the sign to ‚ÄòOPEN,‚Äô turn on the overhead lights, and take a second - just a second - to watch the mind-bending reality of the new world from the doorway of ‚ÄòJENNA‚Äôs COFFEE AND CAKES.‚Äô 

‚ÄòMind-bending‚Äô was to put it lightly; it was an absolute horror show; the likes of which Alexander couldn‚Äôt have imagined in his wildest dreams. More often than not, the sky was purple, raining something ‚Ä¶ weirdly acidic and probably dangerous? - freaks of all kinds walked the streets; their appearances ranged from tall, wobbling piles of flesh to small, nearly microscopic people with beaks and top hats - and everything in between. Just when he thought he‚Äôd seen the worst of it, something else showed up to prove him wrong. 
And, the city - the city was more maze-like than ever, nearly impossible to navigate and prone to ‚Ä¶ shifting? 
For all he knew, Jenna‚Äôs Coffee and Cakes was the only establishment, the only building even, to remain consistent throughout his entire time in this place. 

Everything else - well, it was hell. 
He was in hell. 
Either that or he had finally stroked out and was lying somewhere in a coma; maybe his parents were keeping him on life support while his mind concocted this strange, impossible world. 
Which- it was sad to think that this, THIS was the greatest life his wildest imagination could think to give him. 
Was this his peak? 
Was this the best he could ever hope for? 

Alexander walked out into the not-so-fresh morning air, sidestepped beneath the front awning, leaned back against the wall, and shoved his fist into his pants pocket. It took him a minute to locate it, but when he did, he produced a fresh pack of menthol cigarettes, shoved one ritualistically between his lips, and proceeded to light it with his lucky zippo. 

He was a tall, lanky man with a mop of dark brown curls, tired grey eyes, and an aquiline nose; his most prominent feature was the large tattoo of a skull on the front of his neck, which seemed to glare over the collar of his top; or, maybe it was the fishhook stuck in the cartilage of his right ear - 
Either way, everything about him, from the socks full of holes to the frown lines, the glowering expression, unbrushed hair, unkempt stubble, and stained apron, screamed ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs butt‚Äô about this establishment or anyone in it. 

And he didn‚Äôt; he really didn‚Äôt. 
If Jenna intended to actually fire him, she would‚Äôve done that a long time ago; but she didn‚Äôt, and he was still stuck here in hell-world serving coffee to freaks and pretending that everything was A-OK-BUD! 

‚ÄúNO SMOKING OUT FRONT, BUD!‚Äù A chipper, high-pitched voice called from inside, which he chose to ignore until it was repeated with a persistent tap against the window. 

Alexander cursed under his breath, exhaled a cloud of smoke through his nostrils, snubbed the cigarette beneath his slip-proof workbook, and turned to greet Jenna with an artificial smile and wave of his hand. 
‚ÄúGood morning.‚Äù 

‚ÄúGOOD MORNING, BUD! HOW YA DOIN TODAY?‚Äù Jenna, the living, unbreathing, life-sized Barbie doll asked with an unmoving mouth. She moved as though she were puppeted by invisible hands, with staggering steps and sudden, jerky movements.   

‚ÄúPeachy,‚Äù he answered sarcastically and stepped through the doorway into the otherwise empty shop. 

‚ÄúTHAT‚ÄôS WONDERFUL, BUD! WE‚ÄôRE EXPECTING A NEW MEMBER OF THE FAMILY TODAY! I EXPECT YOU TO BE ON YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR AND TRAIN THEM WELL!‚Äù

He wouldn‚Äôt, but he answered, ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù and took his place behind the front counter. 

Jenna stopped and turned on the pointed tips of her plastic toes as though to look directly at him. She had a painted face - blue eyes, a slightly upturned nose, a great, big smile, and long blonde hair. Today, she wore the gaudiest pink dress he had ever seen - along with the standard apron, of course. 

‚ÄúLET‚ÄôS NOT HAVE A REPEAT OF LAST TIME,  OKAY, BUD?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got it, Jenna.‚Äù Not that he knew which ‚Äòlast time‚Äô she was referring to exactly. It was just as well - the front door chime sounded to announce the presence of a new person. 

‚ÄúWelcome to Jenna‚Äôs coffee and cakes,‚Äù Alex greeted reflexively from where he leaned tiredly against the register. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs specials are burnt coffee and stale muffins.‚Äù 

#4: ‚ÄúWhere the heart lies‚Äù 

Synopsis: YC is the second daughter of four to Mr. And Mrs. Elliot Barclay of Morrison Manor in Devonshire. As an eligible woman of a respectable, but not particularly wealthy, family, it is Mrs. Elliot‚Äôs singular goal to secure a good match to ensure YC‚Äôs future happiness and the increase of the family fortune.
This, of course, necessitates a great deal of appearances within certain social circles; some, of which, are shared by MC‚Äôs family, the Crawfords, who are the present object of Mrs. Elliot‚Äôs scorn on account of a ‚Äústolen inheritance.‚Äù
YC and MC meet during a party hosted by a mutual friend. 
Drama ensues. 

Setting: 5 April 1810 
Devonshire, England


What should have been a peaceful spring morning in the Barclay household was anything but, and Mrs. Elliot served to rouse the impatience, if not mutual disdain, as was intended and ignored, of her husband over a matter most pressing, and which could be expediently summarized by the paragraph of a short letter. 
‚ÄúMy love! Oh, my love, how unfeeling you must be to hear the contents of this notice and not think of our poor condition!‚Äù 
Declared Mrs. Elliot who regarded her husband‚Äôs resolve to enjoy the morning paper without immediate comment. 
‚ÄúTo think that you, the only living relation of the honorable Baron George Barclay, would be entirely disregarded in favor of a complete stranger! And, not just any stranger, oh no!‚Äù The last statement was punctuated by a raise of the letter which bore the insult to their name, but Mr. Elliot gave it no look. No, a mere ‚Äòhmph‚Äô was the only acknowledgment he paid his wife‚Äôs indignation. 
‚ÄúThe sum of all of his estate, totaling over fifty thousand pounds, was left to a Mr. Henry Crawford of Harfield; the same Henry Crawford who is already so well established. I dare say, at seven and twenty, he surpasses all hopes we could envisage for ourselves; and now it is secured, by what ùò¥ùò©ùò∞ùò∂ùò≠ùò• have been rightfully yours, that he will never know a day of suffering! Did not your cousin know of our economy? We have been forced to reduce our servants to three, we own no carriage of our own, and our daughters, my love, our daughters, are of an age where they ùò¥ùò©ùò∞ùò∂ùò≠ùò• enjoy all the refinery of society. How should poor Luisa and -YC‚Äôs name- hope to procure a good match with little less than five hundred pounds each? They are forced to make do with last year‚Äôs fashion!‚Äù 

In all of Devonshire, there was not a man more patient than Elliot Barclay; indeed, it was a virtue well-established in youth by the overbearing, but well-meaning attention of his mother and refined by the fiery temper of his beloved Eleanor; which, presently, he wore as a muzzle in the face of her fury. 
But, at last, his attention was caught at the mention of their daughters‚Äô plights and he lowered the paper to regard Mrs. Elliot pensively from across the breakfast table. 
‚ÄúIt is true that our Luisa and -YC‚Äôs name- will have much to overcome if their hope is to marry into wealth; but, isn‚Äôt it enough to wish their happiness? As I live, pretty creatures of their conduct must win the affections of decent, hardworking gentlemen.‚Äù 

‚ÄúLa!‚Äù Mrs. Elliot scoffed. ‚ÄúI see you do not understand happiness, so I shall enlighten you. So long as they want for money they shall never know a day‚Äôs rest; and, where is the happiness in that? They shall be discontented all the days of their pitiable lives! And, we shall be all the worse for it, my love, for we shall spend the sunset of our existence in the knowledge of their misery.‚Äù 

Mr. Elliot nodded in somber understanding of the situation and was quiet for several minutes while their tea was refreshed. 
‚ÄúPerhaps,‚Äù he began again and made hopeful by a thought that suddenly occurred to him. 
‚Äú‚Ä¶it is not so hopeless a situation. There may yet be a bachelor of good standing who will want nothing more than all the creature comforts provided by a woman of good upbringing. For if a man is already so wealthy, what want he with more? Nay. I say he would consider the character of a woman, her natural beauty, her virtues and charm before he would inquire as to the amount of her worth. Perhaps Mr. Crawford himself-‚Äú 

‚ÄúYou must not speak his name in my presence!‚Äù Mrs. Elliot interjected with grave severity.
‚ÄúI would never approve a match with the man who stole our family fortune. No, you must harden your heart against the thought immediately. I would rather our daughters discard the bloom of their youth entirely than give ùò©ùò™ùòÆ the satisfaction of their conquest.‚Äù 

However, any further debate on the matter was set aside at the arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Marlin of Downsend, who were dear, lifelong friends of the Barclays, and an advantageous connection to a society that might otherwise prove inaccessible to individuals of their lower status.

‚ÄúOh, my dear Eleanor!‚Äù Mrs. Marlin gushed at the sight of her friend with a kiss to the cheek and polite regard for her appearance. 
‚ÄúBut, I am so happy to have found you at breakfast and not yet departed; for I feared that you would be halfway to town upon the hour.‚Äù 

‚ÄúLa,‚Äù Mrs. Elliot dismissed the concern with a smile that bore all the tender love and affection of a sister. ‚ÄúCome, come and take your place at the table. We are always so happy to receive your company, but pray tell what news brings you to us without foreword of your arrival? Otherwise, we might have prepared something more suitable for company.‚Äù 

But, their company was happy to join the Barclays at breakfast and made no protest at the spread of pastries, cold meats, cheeses, jams, clotted cream, and tea. 
‚ÄúYou will not find me so imposing once you learn my motivation for coming without notice.  For, I come bearing both news and an invitation,‚Äù Mrs. Marlin declared excitedly, as she reached to plop a single cube of sugar into her teacup. 
The Marlins were portly figures, well-rounded from years of excess and no inclination toward penance. Mrs. Marlin, herself, was nearly twice the size of Mrs. Elliot, with a voice soft as Mullen leaves and jovial disposition that lent good cheer. The effect of one character upon the other in marriage is as inevitable as the passage of seasons; in the case of Dr. and Mrs. Marlin, it was entirely to the benefit of both; wherein seeds of love thrived in the bloom of spring, and the couple, although far from youth, radiated a youthful joy that reflected all the feelings of complacency in life. Together, they bore and raised two sons and three daughters; four of which had married, and one, their eldest son Richard, who had not yet settled, as he was determined to win the affections of -YC‚Äôs name-. 
Mrs. Marlin‚Äôs gown was a soft pink muslin of fashionable appearance, although her age and figure did it very little justice. Strands of pearls decorated the folds of her neck; or, rather, entirely concealed what should have been a neck beneath a bulky display of opulence. 
Dr. Marlin was a retired apothecary whose practice was now well-managed by both sons in Plymouth where they resided. 

Mr. and Mrs. Elliot, in contrast, were thin and grave in appearance, with wrinkled eyes, sunken cheeks, and an air of rancor. They retained very little handsomeness afforded by youth and suffered the coldest of winters in a marriage of rigid placidity. What had once been bearable in the conflict of character and wit on account of Mr. Elliot‚Äôs work as county clerk had soon reached peak torment in his retirement. Presently, there was no escape from his wife‚Äôs incessancy, save for the days spent hunting game. His consolations were few and consisted, primarily, of the company kept in the presence of his four daughters; he loved each of them exceedingly and was sore-pressed to ever see them leave Morrison Manor, which was precisely what his wife intended to make happen. 

‚ÄúThere, my darling girls,‚Äù Mrs. Elliot addressed her daughters with a smile as they entered the breakfast parlor and greeted the Marlins with familial warmth. 
‚ÄúDoes not YC resemble my Elliot‚Äôs sister? Dorothy was her name. I remember her well; I believe all of England should remember her divinity.‚Äù 

‚ÄúShe does, indeed,‚Äù Mrs. Marlin agreed with a kiss to the cheeks of both -YC‚Äôs name- and Luisa. Dr. Marlin was not quite so familiar in his greeting but offered a polite nod and press of his palm. 
‚ÄúI say, they have both grown into ladies of exceptional beauty. It would be a shame to let the blessing of their bloom go to waste here in the countryside. There is hardly a man to match their merit; and, if there were, he would already be attached.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI believe Dick to be quite fond of -YC‚Äôs name-,‚Äù Mr. Marlin teased in reference to their eldest son‚Äôs past pursuits. 
‚ÄúHe asks after you often; I‚Äôm sure he would have joined us had his schedule permitted it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDo not tease her so directly, my dear,‚Äù Mrs. Marlin scolded. ‚ÄúAt her age, it is best to let her absorb a variety of characters so that she might settle upon what is most agreeable with her nature. Ah, but I have such wonderful news for the both of you. As you already know, our family has long been acquainted with Lord and Lady Langford who, at this time of year, prefer Bath to the countryside on account of his lordship‚Äôs gouty disposition. It is nearing their annual spring ball; the likes of which I‚Äôm certain girls of your age have never witnessed.‚Äù

‚ÄúAn extraordinarily gay time,‚Äù Mr. Marlin remarked between puffs at the pipe he struggled to light. 

‚ÄúOh, yes, quite. I have been in contact with Lady Langford who has requested that I exercise the reach of my influence in society to ally seven or ten more guests of great beauty to join our party. For, as her Ladyship explained, she has taken great liberties to invite the entire naval ship under Captain Ingham.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMy word,‚Äù Mrs. Elliot muttered between careful sips of tea. 
‚ÄúAn entire naval ship?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHer son serves under Captain Ingham, as I recall, so it should come as no strange surprise. But, here is the principle of our visit; I extend the invitation to both -YC‚Äôs name- and Luisa, with the hope that they will join Mr. Marlin and myself on our trip to Bath. We mean to leave in two days.‚Äù

Mrs. Elliot smiled at the invitation and looked to her girls with an expression that conveyed a resoluteness in an unspoken decision on the matter; of course, they would go. 
‚ÄúI imagine there will be many gentlemen of great esteem in attendance?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, yes, many; and not just gentlemen, but eligible gentlemen,‚Äù Mrs. Marlin reassured. ‚ÄúThe Hatfields, the McCarthys, the Bartons, the Musgraws, and the Crawfords-‚Äú 

‚ÄúThe Crawfords? Oh dear,‚Äù Mrs. Elliot interjected with a frown. 

‚ÄúOf course. Their eldest is expected to be in attendance; as I recall, he is a cold, but strikingly handsome man-‚Äú

‚ÄúLa!‚Äù Mrs. Elliot dismissed the claim with a raise of her right hand. ‚ÄúSpare me the details of his person. No daughter of mine will be acquainted with the likes of him - or any of the Crawfords, for that matter. I am settled in my position and I beg that you not inquire as to the reason; trust that I say this entirely for the benefit of our family.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMy word. Of course. But, it will be such a large party and the Crawfords are so exceedingly popular, there is very little chance your girls should meet with them; of that, I can assure you.‚Äù 

Mrs. Elliot calmed at the reassurance of her friend and, just as her resolution dissolved, it reshaped in the hope of her daughters‚Äô prosperity. ‚ÄúI believe this to be an extraordinary opportunity. What say the both of you?‚Äù She asked the girls with a glance in their direction. ",1,1734638045.0,Roleplay,2,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Whitening your teeth can give you a brighter smile, but you may have concerns about its effects on your enamel. Let‚Äôs explore the relationship between teeth whitening and enamel health, and what you should keep in mind before undergoing a whitening procedure.

### Understanding Enamel and Its Role

To appreciate the impact of teeth whitening, it's essential to understand enamel. Enamel is the hard, outer surface of your teeth that protects against decay and damage. This protective layer is made primarily of minerals, and while it is the hardest tissue in your body, it can still be vulnerable to wear and tear.

### The Types of Teeth Whitening Products

There are several methods for whitening teeth, each with varying effects on enamel health:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Treatments:** Professional whitening procedures performed by a dentist. These typically use stronger bleaching agents, which can be more effective but may pose a risk to enamel if not used correctly.
- **At-Home Kits:** These include whitening strips or trays with lower concentrations of bleaching agents. They are more accessible but may require longer use, which can also affect your enamel.
- **Natural Remedies:** Methods like baking soda or charcoal are popular, but their abrasiveness can erode enamel over time.

### How Whitening Affects Enamel

Teeth whitening products, particularly those containing hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, can lead to short-term enamel changes:

1. **Temporary Sensitivity:** After using whitening products, you might notice increased sensitivity to hot or cold. This is because the bleach can penetrate the enamel and irritate the underlying dentin.
2. **Potential Erosion:** Overuse of whitening products can lead to enamel erosion. This happens when harsh chemicals or abrasives wear down enamel, leaving your teeth vulnerable to decay.
3. **Whitening Effectiveness:** While whitening agents are designed to lighten tooth color, their effectiveness varies based on enamel condition. Damaged or thinned enamel may not yield the desired results.

### Best Practices for Safe Teeth Whitening

If you want to maintain your enamel while achieving a brighter smile, consider the following tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Consult a Dentist:** Before starting any whitening treatment, talk to your dentist. They can assess your enamel's health and recommend the best options.
- **Follow Instructions:** Always adhere to the recommended usage guidelines for any whitening product. Overuse can lead to diminished enamel strength and increased sensitivity.
- **Limit Frequency:** Avoid excessively frequent whitening sessions. Opt for a chairside treatment every few years and use at-home kits less frequently.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to help wash away acids and sugars that can erode enamel. This can aid in maintaining a healthy mouth, even after whitening.

### Signs of Enamel Erosion

It‚Äôs vital to be aware of signs that may indicate enamel erosion:

- Increased tooth sensitivity to temperature or sweetness
- Visible yellowing of the teeth as underlying dentin becomes exposed
- Rough or uneven tooth edges
- Transparent edges on the front teeth

### Maintaining Enamel Health

To keep your enamel healthy during and after whitening:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste can strengthen enamel and prevent decay.
- **Use a Soft-Bristled Toothbrush:** This reduces the risk of enamel wear while brushing.
- **Avoid Acidic Foods:** Limit your intake of soda, citrus fruits, and any foods that can wear down enamel.

Ultimately, the impact of teeth whitening on enamel can vary greatly depending on the product and frequency of use. By being informed and following best practices, you can achieve that dazzling smile while keeping your enamel intact. Remember, a beautiful smile starts with healthy teeth!

Safe Teeth Whitening Methods: Protecting Your Enamel While Achieving a Brighter Smile
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your smile is often considered one of your most valuable assets, and many people strive for a whiter, brighter appearance. Teeth whitening can bring about this change, but there is a lingering question: can teeth whitening damage enamel? Understanding this concern is essential for a healthy smile. Fortunately, with safe teeth whitening methods, it is possible to achieve dental brightness while protecting your enamel.

Teeth whitening works by removing stains and discoloration on the tooth surface. It‚Äôs important to remember that the enamel is the protective layer on your teeth, and keeping it intact is vital for your oral health. Overuse of harsh whitening treatments can indeed lead to enamel erosion, which results in increased sensitivity and a higher risk of cavities. So, how do you maintain smile brightness without compromising your enamel?

### Choosing Professional Whitening Treatments

One of the safest methods for whitening your teeth is to seek treatment from a dental professional. Dentists use clinically-tested products that are more effective and gentler on your enamel than over-the-counter options. They can help determine the best approach tailored to your needs. Here are some professional options:

- **In-office whitening:** This procedure involves applying a bleaching agent directly to your teeth under controlled conditions, ensuring safety and effectiveness.
- **Custom at-home bleaching trays:** Your dentist can provide you with custom-made trays filled with a lower concentration of whitening gel, allowing for gradual and safe whitening.

### Understanding Over-the-Counter Products

If you prefer a DIY approach, there are various over-the-counter teeth whitening products available. However, not all products are created equal. To protect your enamel:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Look for enamel-safe labels:** Choose products specifically designed with enamel-safe formulas.
- **Follow instructions carefully:** Overusing or misapplying these products can lead to adverse effects on your enamel.
- **Consult your dentist:** Before starting any over-the-counter treatment, discuss it with your dentist to ensure it won‚Äôt harm your enamel.

### Consider Natural Teeth Whitening Options

Some people prefer natural remedies for teeth whitening, believing they are gentler on the enamel. Here are a few popular natural methods:

- **Baking soda:** A mild abrasive that can help remove surface stains when used sparingly. Mix it with water to form a paste and brush gently.
- **Activated charcoal:** Known for its detoxifying properties, activated charcoal may absorb stains on teeth. Ensure to rinse thoroughly after use.
- **Whitening toothpaste:** Certain toothpaste options can help remove stains and brighten teeth without containing harsh chemicals.

### Maintain Good Oral Hygiene

Preventing stains will reduce the need for aggressive whitening methods. Here are some simple habits that help:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Brush twice a day:** Using fluoride toothpaste helps strengthen enamel.
- **Floss daily:** This prevents plaque buildup that can lead to discoloration.
- **Limit stain-causing foods and drinks:** Beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine can contribute to staining. Rinse with water after consuming such items.

### Be Mindful of Sensitivity

Teeth sensitivity can be a common side effect of whitening treatments. If you experience this after using whitening products, stop using them immediately and consult your dentist. They might recommend desensitizing toothpaste or other solutions to protect your enamel while still allowing you to achieve your desired brightness.

It‚Äôs essential to recognize that while teeth whitening is an appealing option for a more dazzling smile, it comes with responsibilities. By choosing safe methods and being mindful of your enamel‚Äôs health, you can enjoy a bright smile without worrying about damage. Always prioritize your oral health and consult with your dentist on the best approaches for your teeth. Remember, a beautiful smile is not just about brightness; it‚Äôs also about maintaining healthy teeth for years to come.

### Conclusion

Maintaining the health of your enamel while pursuing a brighter smile is essential for long-term dental well-being. Understanding the impact of teeth whitening procedures is crucial, as some methods can affect enamel strength and integrity. It's important to stay informed about the various whitening options available, as not all are created equal.

Opting for professional whitening treatments, guided by a dental professional, generally offers the safest approach.

There it was in full display. Epifanio de los Santos Avenue in the year of our Lord, two thousand and thirty-one. Where once it bustled with the mighty blaring of jeepneys, automobiles, and busses, there is now only the constant grinding, the cacophony of a thousand horse-drawn charabancs and modified cargo beds, dragging along with a disheartening slowness.

After nearly a hundred years of modernity, equestrian transport had reemerged. Of diesel-powered vehicles, only the Metrobus remained under a program of the regional government. Its seats were no place for the common man.

Of course, it's not in yet and probably wont be in till Monday because the worker getting paid is never a priority. Not the biggest deal tho, but I was a buck off from my coffee this morning.

Just had a guy offer to buy me a coffee at Starbucks while he saw me rooting around getting my change together. I was like, ""hey all I actually need is a buck if you've got it"" and he was like, ""nah I don't really carry cash but I can get you one if you want"" and I told him I appreciate that and I was just trying to get a regular coffee. 

So he orders it and me and him start talking and I'm like ""damn so I guess it's just pretty obvious at this point that I'm unhoused huh"" pointing at the new giant tear I got in my outer layer last night and my bag. I told him I'd started a job around here recently and I'm just waiting on my check to drop.

He was like, ""yeah but at least you're trying to help yourself. Trying to get up out of your situation. Do you mind if I ask you a question?"", ""No"" ""Do you have faith?""

üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®

I told him no I don't. He asked why, I told him science. I told him there's never been any evidence to suggest that any god exists. I was very tactful about how I said these responses. I didn't want to offend him, but I also didn't want to lie to him. He said, ""have you ever tried (to have faith)"" I told him yeah, which was the only lie I told him.

Ever since I was around ten years old and I learned that there's supposedly a god (our flavor was Christian, but we didn't practice at all. Never went to church or anything. Never prayed), I had some base level questions that nobody around me could answer. It gave me a bit of a crisis in my ten year old brain, but I got over it fast enough. 

As I got a little bit older, I noticed it wasn't just my family that couldn't answer simple questions about their god, it was pretty much everyone. Nobody has a coherent answer or proof.. it's always just something they can ""feel"", or, they came to believe because their god visited them in a dream or something. 

This solidified my view that it was made up, but I didn't know why yet, and I didn't really care to look into it. Most people around me weren't religious either and didn't talk about it. As I got older still and became an adult, I discovered some YouTube channels that would talk about religion in depth. Not to prove it, but to help people escape from their indoctrination.

My favorite to this day is a talk show where they take callers who give their case for why they believe in god, as well as many many other topics that revolve around religion, and they would attempt to explain to them why that thought process isn't scientifically sound. Not for the benefit of the caller necessarily, but for the benefit of those listening who may be questioning their faith.

I really like this approach, particularly since many of these people can be very VERY nasty humans, and if they get too wild, they can just hang up the phone on them, or like, if they won't stop talking long enough for the hosts to respond, they can just mute them and explain what they need to explain. 

So anyway, big digression. The guy then says, ""you know, most people don't find faith in science, they find faith by looking for love. Looking for that companionship. And thats when they find god."" I was like yeah. We wrapped up with me telling him I don't knock anyone for believing in god, and he said the same about atheism. While I don't knock anyone for their beliefs, I do find religion to be an extremely destructive force in the world, for various reasons, and I always hope people can come out from under the indoctrination.

He then immediately says, ""Well Alex, do you mind if I pray for you?"" I told him I didn't mind. So, right there, in front of the whole coffee shop, he puts his hand on my shoulder and loudly prays for me to find Jesus. I played along out of respect, even bowing my head.. but I want all you believers to know, this shit is very disrespectful to us. Please don't do this. This is highly embarrassing and it makes my skin crawl, to the point that if I'd had foresight to know this is how our interaction would've ended, I would've turned down the coffee, though that probably wouldn't have stopped him. 

After we wrapped up with that and he left, I could hear a couple sitting across the room start talking about church, with one of them proclaming how much they love church, and it was a sobering reminder of the world I live in, and how dominated it is by religion. Much like the other minority groups of the world, religious people will never understand what it's like to feel like that.

Hello all! I'm a busy SAHM on a ranch. I cannot justify spending more than 150$(on sale or refurbished included) on a machine I use once a day to have an enjoyable cup of coffee. A moka pot has been sufficient but its finicky on my stove.

I know it‚Äôs a smaller brand and made in China but wow‚Ä¶ I am amazed by this machine. First things first coffee is amazing. I‚Äôm coming from a Breville infuser which I thought I had progressed to making very good espresso on. The Inizio was an instant difference, no more lingering sour notes, flavors are bright and up front. Finally I can taste the flavors on the coffees tasting profile. 
Second, the value on this thing is truly wild. Got it on an open box sale for $1200 CAD, for that you get an e61 group, PID, rotary pump, stainless boiler‚Ä¶ the list really goes on and on. Heat up time is excellent as well. The rotary pump is often overlooked but it makes it whisper quiet and you get a nice smooth flow of water. 
Build quality, this thing is right up there with the Rancillio, ECM, Rocket machines I‚Äôve handled. Metal has no sharp edges and all the panels fit well with very good attention to detail on the smaller bits. If you are looking for this type of machine, give Bellezza a shot, in my opinion the value is unbeatable. If you have any questions, let them fly in the comments or DM me.

1hi1aw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HEALTHY/comments/1hi1aw2/hypothyroidism_overweight_also_bad_skin_hair_and/,"Hypothyroidism? Overweight? Also bad skin, hair and nails? I fixed this. Part 1: Hypothyroidism ","Disclaimer: I am writing this from the perspective of a mentally and physically healthy person whose weight was affected by hypothyroidism and whose bad skin was due to my gut-health and not hormonal reasons. My self care tips help to improve things that are already there and don't replace professional help. Please check with your doctors. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way... Girlies, I would NEVER gate keep my recipe for an improved life and I'm not trying to sell shit. Just lemme be the big sister you didn't ask for but you needed. (Extra self-care tips for skin, hair, style and nails in my next threads to get the glow up you need for 2025.)

In April of 2024, I (26f) got diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Got a prescription of 25mg L-Theroxin. It gave me a high for maybe two weeks and then I felt... nothing. I was stagnant. The symptoms are still there. Couldn't lose weight, still tired af all the time. You name it. Also I got perioral dermatitis but that's a story for a different thread but I was... not in a good place for a moment.

Now I can say I have a healthy weight, great skin, better hair and I sleep like a baby and here is what I did to fix it, thanks to a friend of mine with the same problems but 10 years more experience and research:

- started taking the following supplements: (not the drug store kind, they're whack) 

In the morning: 1. yeast-based probiotic (30 min before breakfast. I had strep throat once, took this shit and was like oh wow, my skin is glowwwing but it's optional here) 2. iodine from kelp (don't take this if you have ""hyper""thyroidism) 3. magnesium (with a glass of water)

With breakfast: 3. Vitamin D3+K2 with a fat-based food source. (Take 30 drops for the first 3 days and take 4 drops every day after) 4. Vitamin B12

Inbetween meals:  5. selenium (good for skin, nails, hair, against cell-damage, avoid taking this with Vitamin C because they cancel each other out), 6. zinc (don't pair this with any other supplement or foods)

After workout/day:
7. Amino acids: L-Tyrosine, L-Methionine, L-Lysine and L-Phenylalanine (your body that's riddled with hypothyroidism needs these to break down protein properly because right now, IT DOESN'T), + another dose of magnesium (for good sleep)

My friend doesn't need her L-Theroxin medication anymore. I can say I feel a lot better since taking them. Since then, I have the energy to:

- go to the gym 3-4 times a week, steadily increasing my weights. I put on muscle and lost fat tissue. (It helps to have a gym-crush) Goal: 6k steps and a burn of 500 calories. Quickest short cut is dancing. Just have a lil dance party 15min a day.

Pro-tip if you feel ugly at the gym like I do:
- to feel more motivated and in order to not look like a swamp monster during sweaty workouts, I purchased a lip-stain (Elf) and a lash perm kit. No need for foundation or concealer anymore thanks to the selenium and my new moisturizer. I work out better when I look better. (More low maintenance tips in other threads.)

Unfortunately, working out a lot doesn't do shit if you're not in a calorie deficit. Uuurgh, I know... I hate that ""they"" are right.

- I cancelled all sugars and sugar alternatives. The less you eat sweet things, the less you crave it. I promise. A nice side effect: the no sugar diet cleared my skin but most importantly, it was the key to help me lose weight. It's like magic. Why no sugar alternatives? Maltodextrin. This little devil is worse than sugar! It spikes your glucose and increases blood sugar. This hidden little crack-pot causes your insuline to spike even worse than it does with regular sugar and you even gain weight. It's not even listed in the table of contents but it's there! Bad news for zero sugar energy drink lovers. Only mate and coffee for us, sorry.

- I don't eat butter at all and rarely drink whole milk anymore. One is too fatty, the other unnecessary if you ask me. Instead I use extra virgin olive oil and milk with 1% fat content. 

- Well, what do I eat? Everything in moderation (intuitive eating) for volume and what keeps me satiated for long. For example:

- many different sources of protein. The more variation on one plate, the better. Get creative. Have a bean/meat/veggie quesadilla in a lentil tortilla 

- steamed vegetables and homemade chicken nuggets/other source of protein with potatoes.

- lentil and vegetable stews

My current obsession:
- a vegan Turkish dish called √áiƒü K√∂fte (in a salad wrap with a yoghurt drizzle) keeps me satiated for hours. 169 calories per 100gr. I don't have to force myself to eat it every day because I literally crave it. Ask me for the recipe, I double dare you.

- the most important for a great metabolism boost: immune smoothie in the morning. 1 orange, 1 apple, ginger, cinnamon, cayenne pepper and tumeric. Do eat whole fruits otherwise. Pomelo is great.

- my sweet treat: 70% dark chocolate and dates, there are also healthy cookie recipes online.

Give yourself time and patience to get used to the new routine but I swear the results are so worth it! Et voil√†, suddenly I'm hot. Try it and thank me never!

You all have definitely made this journey easier and more fun!

I began this obsession in the Spring, so I'm a relative newb. Here is my current situation:

* Current setup: BBP with the updated Baratza burrs, single dose adapter for grinder with bellows, IMS H28 basket, SS puck screen.
* Current technique: RDT, WDT, distributor, leveling tamper, typically 1:2 or 1:2.2 ratios
* Current drink preferences: I do two double espressos per day. My wife does 1-2 Americanos or Lattes per day.
* Current taste preferences: I am fond of lighter roasts. Love the bright, floral types. My wife prefers medium roasts.
* Current bean rotation:
   * Day-to-day is Ruta Maya medium roast sourced from Costco. Since I live in Texas, I'm able to get 2lb bags with roast dates within 30 days of purchase (can't beat a $15 price point). Wife finds these shots perfect for her Americanos and Lattes. I'm not a big fan, but it's not terrible.
   * I supplement by buying smaller bags of specialty coffee. I travel a bunch for work, so I love to bring home bags from roasters all over the country to try. As mentioned, I trend towards lighter roasts, single origin, fun and exciting stuff (compared to the Ruta Maya, at least).

My thought is I'd like to get a new grinder to use exclusively for the better beans I source, and continue to use the integrated grinder for the medium roast/Ruta Maya my wife prefers.

Considering I've heard that flat burrs are better with highlighting the strengths of lighter roasts, I'm considering DF54, DF64, and DF83.

Budget: I'd prefer not to spend more than $800 on a grinder. I'm not opposed to buying used if I can get a good deal. In fact, someone in my area is selling a Turin DF83V for $500 on FBM.

Basically, it's stiff enough that I'm a little concerned about turning with one hand while holding a coffee in the other, and I'm continuously surprised at how far I have to turn the wheel.

I have read that there are occasionally power steering pump issues, but I don't *think* that's what's happening here. I've owned cars that don't have power steering and it doesn't feel like that, and the behavior is the same when the car isn't moving as when it is.

Is this just how Mini steering is supposed to be? Are there ways to control things like the assist pressure and/or travel?

I read that it can go up to 10s and if it starts leaking like that it means my coffee is saturated and I need to grind finer. I don‚Äôt mind doing so if needed or even just having less pre infusion ? 

But my coffee comes out pretty slowly taking >35s for me to get even 30g of output. 

The coffee itself tastes ok but it‚Äôs jsut a tad bit bitter I feel like it could be a littttle nuttier/smoother. But overall it‚Äôs like not necessarily bad anymore loll. 

Any advice? Should I grind coarser and just pre infuse less?

So what happens at this meetup?

Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 7 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time. Currently we are averaging 15-25 people turning up.

Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?

No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.

Can I come along?

Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.

What if I don't want alcohol?

No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.

Since after the above people still asked...

I'm ********* is it OK if I come along?

We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Location/Time: Latymers, W6 8BS / People often start turning up from 18:00ish. The pub is closing at 21:00 this week, so we may head somewhere else afterwards if they're people up for it.

So he won‚Äôt be home early at all. His boss takes the crew out to lunch anywhere from twice a week to once every other week. It‚Äôs pretty common. 

I am exhausted, sick, and getting no breaks from any of it. Husband gets up two hours before he has to go to work, but never does the dishes, cleaning, etc. He just sits on his phone and drinks coffee. I am up with the baby at night and then with him all day while also working part time from home. Although I did email my boss this week telling him it‚Äôs too much for me because I am trying to keep the baby‚Äôs temperature down. 

Am I wrong for wishing my husband would just say ‚Äúsorry I told the wife I‚Äôd be home early, she‚Äôs home sick with the baby‚Äù Things like this don‚Äôt even cross his mind and it bums me out. I was just venting to him today about how stressed out I am with household chores and the sick baby. I‚Äôm just at my wits end and feel overlooked. 

Edit to add because of ‚Äúdeadbeat‚Äù comments: when he is home after work he is helpful, he plays with the baby, changes the diapers, cleans with me etc. He is just the type to ‚Äúgo with the flow‚Äù and not say anything when his boss says he‚Äôs taking everyone out to lunch. He also is great at doing laundry and bringing it up for me to fold. That‚Äôs kind of his ‚Äúchore‚Äù. He‚Äôs not a deadbeat but I feel like he isn‚Äôt the most considerate when it comes to my time and my life at home I guess. ",11,1734636365.0,amiwrong,30,0.76,False
1hi0uhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hi0uhr/psa_not_all_bottom_paper_filters_setups_created/,PSA - Not all bottom paper filters + setups created equal. Prewetting some filters may SLOW the flow rate instead.,"Although most people that start to use bottom paper filters (both dry and wet) tend to notice that they increase flow and create faster/shorter shot times (with evidences of higher extraction as a result), contrary to popular belief, apparently that doesn't appear to be the case for what seems to be, either all filter paper types/brands or all setups in combination with them.

Ever since I started experimenting with my paper filters (IKAPE brand, claims to be made from natural virgin Japanese pulp, no reviews/reports of any notable issues with them), initially I have only used them as completely dry (as I had noticed that is how most of the highly reputable folks appear to be using them) and I did notice a slight increase in flow rate and decreased shot times compared to no filter (as expected). However, as I was still learning and dialing in my WDT process, in hopes to minimize any chance of them moving during WDT, (and not seeing anyone previously report any notable changes with wet vs dry filters), I decided to try prewetting them as well to get them to stick the bottom of the basket a little better.

Ever since I started prewetting them however, I had noticed a drastic INCREASE in shot times and significantly slower flow rate whenever using same grind sizes and puck prep attempts as my previous tests with only dry paper filters. In fact the first time I decided to soak it fully (keeping the same grind size (14) but actually dosing a gram less (19g)) I had completely choked the machine for the first time ever! Considering I had never seen anyone previously report of any notable changes prewetting the paper filters, initially I didn't even think to consider that the difference between a slightly damp and fully soaked filter was the reason. As I was still trying to get better at WDT with each attempt, I was certain that was the reason I had choked the machine (I figured maybe I finally the got the technique down properly to where I'm not creating channels anymore and finally making an even bed of coffee, hence the far slower flow rate due to the even extraction - that was the initial hypothesis at least).

And so in an attempt to fix the issue, I figured, let me try to then increase the grind size now (to 15), but leave everything else the same. And sure enough, although this time the machine wasn't choked, it was still FAR slower than any of my other attempts at the same grind size before.

Since my numbers still weren't hitting my target flow rate (too slow), I decided to grind another size up from there (to 16) just to see where that lands me. And that time I finally went over my target flow rate and ended up slightly too fast. So I figured ok great, then the appropriate grind size to hit my target numbers should be somewhere in between (15-16). As I had 3 clicks in between each number I figured I would do everything the same but try the first click after 15 (15.25) when I do it next time (at this point I was starting to feel pretty confident in my WDT technique as well as the numbers were starting to make sense and be more consistent with the changes).

And so the next day comes and I attempt the same (still fully soaking the paper filter) but going to 15.25 grind size instead. And as soon as I tried to brew that. I again choked the machine (something that had only previously happened at grind size 14 and did NOT happen for grind size 15). At this point I was totally confused and at a loss of what was happening. Was something wrong with the machine perhaps?

So then I had the theory...I started having issues with decreased flow rate ever since I started soaking the paper filters with my RDT spray in the basket. Maybe oversaturating the filter with room temp water and cooling my basket (maybe plugging up the holes from surface tension as well?) were my issue. I had seen some folks use RDT to wet their filters before (and so earlier I just picked the same simply out of convenience), but I did remember that a lot of other folks used their steam wands to wet the filters instead and then placed them in the basket (I had no expectation that there would be much difference other than a slight cooling of the basket).

But I figured, you know what? Let me leave everything exactly as I had now (to what caused the choking) but just try wetting the filter with the steam wand and then placing it in the basket instead. And sure enough...this time the machine did NOT choke (and I was certain I WDTed almost identically to the last attempt), although the flow rate was still far less than my previous attempts at the same (or even finer) grind levels with a dry filter. Thinking I might be onto something now, I said, let me try to do exactly the same, but this time RDT spray to soak the filter as before and then pat it dry with a paper towel just to leave it just damp (instead of soaked) and see what happens then. After doing that...my resulting flow rate basically doubled with that brew (even if my WDT technique was still not up to par there is just no way it could be that drastic of a difference in between two shots with zero changes in between other than the level of water saturation in the paper filter).

While more attempts would ideally be required to be 100% sure, considering how big of a difference in flow rate I noticed between between a fully soaked filter and just a damp one (especially when I felt quite confident at my WDT technique by this point compared to before), we have to come to the natural conclusion that (despite most other folks not noting much of a difference), there has to been something wrong with either these filters, or maybe the combination of the filters with the basket and machine I am using. And so going forward if I continue to use these filters, I will definitely NOT be leaving them fully soaked before putting them in the basket (they will be damp at most, or if I start seeing inconsistent results, then I will just go back to fully dry).

However in an attempt to further prove my theory, since these papers I am using appear to be relatively generic and don't specifically have much reputation behind them, for my next attempts at testing fully soaked papers I decided to order the very reputable Chemex papers that are precut to exact basket size by Good Brothers Coffee. While I am still waiting for those to come in, I still figured I would share my current results with you guys as (despite most other folks' results with wet filters) it seems to be pretty clear that at least my current filters with my current setup appear to be having significant issues whenever they are fully soaked (fibers becomes too tight?).

After I got these results, I had started to research further to see in case if anyone else might have somewhere reported similar issues with wet vs dry (or just decreased flow rate/increased shot times with filters in general), and sure enough I found several other examples (although these are definitely NOT the majority, there is still enough of them to add some traction to my theory.

A few examples below:

https://old.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1952rwl/paper_filters_resulting_in_machine_choking/  
  
And if anyone is interested, here are my personal results that I recorded among my testing - https://i.imgur.com/mJRXfqG.png  

For reference, I am using the following equipment:

**Espresso Machine** - Breville Bambino Plus  
**Grinder** - 1ZPresso JX-Pro (testing between grind size 14-16)  
**Basket** - IMS Precision 18-22g Basket (B62.52TH28E)  
**Puck Screen** - Normcore 53.3mm Puck Screen (1.7mm)  
**Portafilter** - Normcore 54mm Bottomless Portafilter (Titanium PVD Coating)  
**Tamper** - Normcore 53.3mm V4 Tamper (Titanium PVD Coating)  
**Paper Filters** - IKAPE 51mm Espresso Paper Filters  
**WDT Tool** - WISSXOER WDT Needle Tool (10 x 0.35mm needles)  

Other than perhaps the filters themselves, all fairly common equipment otherwise as I understand. Also if anyone had watched Lance Hedrick's video about puck screens/filter papers, the basket I am using (IMS) is NOT the expensive high extraction billet baskets where he refers that filter papers in just those particular baskets may not make any noticeable improvement.

Feel free if anyone would like to share your thoughts and discuss regarding these findings and your experience with filter paper testing (wet or dry or both).

Just to clarify, this is not a discussion regarding the efficacy of filter paper usage as a whole and whether or not they are required (there are plenty of studies, science, and discussions behind that already), but more rather if you are using them already, the differences between using them dry vs varying degrees of wet and whether any differences between paper types/brands and equipment combos (perhaps most notably the baskets and the machines being used).

**TLDR** I have several findings from personal testing that perhaps not all bottom paper filters and combinations of them with setups are created equal. In some cases, prewetting the paper filter may significantly decrease your flow rate and increase your shot times. More testing required but evidence in my particular case (as well as examples from others) shows that this is a possibility and is contrary to expectation.

I hate living with Isaac. My panic attacks flare up more than ever, I can't deal with it. I wanna kill myself. I'm so so so tired of feeling horrible. I try to do exactly what he wants. I do. I really really do. But it seems not enough. He plays with his friends all night, and I do my own thing and leave him alone. It used to be the ""You want to go out too often,"" so I stopped. I barely ask him to go out anymore. I asked him if we can go out for maybe the 3rd time this week. (Huge improvement btw) It started out fine. We went to a coffee shop, and he said he wanted to stay for longer while he reads a book. But the whole reason I wanted to go out was to walk around, so I told him that. He said that I knew that the whole point of us going out right now was to read a book. I said yeah, but I mean, I also want to walk around. It took him a little bit of begging to go, and we went. We walked around a large mall for maybe let's say, 2 hours? And then as we were walking back to go home, there was a temporary tattoo ""stand"". I asked him what it was about, and he said temporary tattoos. I said yeah, let's do that. And he declined. I commented that he was no fun, and he got mad over that, and we had an argument for maybe 15 minutes as we walked back. It was normal after that, until we hit a party? store. His birthday is coming up, and he knew I had been thinking of something for him. I told him I was just going inside to grab something for his birthday, he agreed and he went to a cigarette store to grab refill for his lighter. (He smokes herbs). I went in, and had something in mind, I thought he would adore. The cashier said the total of 20 dollars, and Isaac said absolutely not. (We have 350 dollars every month, and we had quite a bit of that, having it be almost the end of this month). I said I felt disappointed that all of my thought and effort I spent trying to get him a gift were wasted. He said he's a humble man and that he doesn't like the tone I spoke with. (My entire damn life I've had an issue with tone, being too monotone, being rude, Yada Yada). So I said that I just am disappointed and that I really looked forward to getting him a gift. He's been saying that I'm not appreciating him enough, and he talked about types of appreciation. (I've also had a hard time all my life showing appreciation). Gift giving is one of them.

1hi0nfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/2under2/comments/1hi0nfj/whats_your_schedule/,What‚Äôs your schedule?,"23 months  and 10 months.

23 month son sleeps through the night. 10 month daughter still wakes several times through the night, needless to say I‚Äôm exhausted. In the morning, I sleep as absolute late as she will let me. 9 at the latest, usually 7-8am.

For most of the morning I am dead. I drink coffee and let her play, snack, etc. My son is great with independent play at that time and is not an issue.

How are you guys waking up and cleaning? Doing laundry? Walking the dog? My house is consistently cluttered (not dirty, just things that need to be put away).

I know this time passes fast, but I want to live in a clean house. Even if you hire cleaning people, you still need to put away the laundry and toys, etc, which are the issue to begin with. 

Am I missing out on some magic you all have? Maybe you‚Äôre more self disciplined? 

By the time my older daughter gets home from school and my husband comes home from work I‚Äôm a zombie who can barely carry on a conversation. On the weekend my husband will let me sleep in and take the baby around 7am. On weekdays I stay up with the kids because my husband does extensive dental surgeries, we both agree that it‚Äôs not safe for him to get less than 7hrs sleep.

1hi0mgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hi0mgx/i_m18_broke_up_with_my_f18_now_ex_and_i_think_i/,I (M18) broke up with my (F18) now ex and I think I regret it? ,"This is a repost from¬†[r/breakups](/r/breakups/). I apologize for the length of this post, and thank you to everyone who is willing to take the time to read and respond. That means the world.

My now ex and I have known each other since middle school, nearly seven years. I‚Äôve always had feelings for her and she felt the same way about me. We never worked out in high school since we both went to different schools and long distance never worked out with us at a young age. We were always on and off until we just broke contact for like a year a half. 3 months before we both graduated high school I contacted her and told her I still had feelings and she felt the same way. From the beginning of April to the beginning of October we had an incredible relationship. Both each other‚Äôs first kisses, we both became intimate with each other for the first time ever with anyone. We truly loved each other and it was such a cute young relationship. We were both in dumb young love and I truly believed we were gonna get married

Only issue was, she‚Äôs a huge avoidant. Doesn‚Äôt like to show emotions over text, the phone, etc. Her parents never knew about me so we didn‚Äôt see each other that often but when we did she was super physical and I can tell she loved me by the way she treated me in person. When we weren‚Äôt in person, she was always super dry, I always had to initiate being lovey and mushy, and I always felt like I had to beg her to show some emotion. I always felt neglected and felt more in love than she did. I was fine with this because I understand she might not be used to showing emotion but to what extent? I expressed this to her a few times and she would always tell me she would change..and never did.

Fast forward to late September and she started to have a lot of issues in the house. Her parents were constantly arguing and were on the verge of divorce, she tacked on an ample amount of work for college, and she was just stressed all the time. I know this was effecting her a lot and she started to not text me often, wouldn‚Äôt update me on anything, and she just lacked effort. The last two months of our relationship we didn‚Äôt see each other once. We used to FaceTime at least twice a week but now I hadn‚Äôt heard her voice for maybe a month. She never put in any effort all she would do is give me a cute goodmorning message when she woke up or got to college and never text me again until like midnight when she‚Äôll tell me she finished all her college work. Every time we would make plans she would always cancel. It was always something new. She would rarely even apologize. It was just the norm. I just gave up and stopped making plans and waited on her to initiate something..and she never did.

I understand she was super stressed and had a lot on her mind, but I didn‚Äôt feel prioritized anymore. I always told her I was available to talk if she ever needed it and she never did. She always kept to herself. I knew everything was effecting her and I wanted to help as much as I could but I didn‚Äôt know how. She never gave me the green light for anything. This was so egregious where I didn‚Äôt even know what my role in her life was anymore. I would always question if I were even valuable to her, if I even made a difference. If me just merely staying there helped her in anyway? She just became super unavailable, unreliable, inconsistent, frustrating and difficult to love.

I felt incredibly disrespected because she never apologized, never explained the lack of availability, and was never there for me. Not to mention I felt like I was practically begging her to hang out anytime I would ask. If she was bothered by everything at home..tell me. She left me in the dark completely, always expecting something to change and it never did. She never told me just wait on her, be patient with her, About a month before I broke up with her I told her we had to speak in person. She gave me a time, place, and date..and she canceled last minute. A week later? Canceled last minute. We eventually called for the first time in a month and a half I explained myself to her. She apologized and told me she would change but to be honest, I already mentally broke up with her, but I gave her another chance. A week later I told her let‚Äôs grab coffee (with the intention of finally breaking up) and she canceled AGAIN. Enough was enough and I broke up with her over text. I let everything out in a very respectful manner. She reciprocated the same energy and said she understood.

Breaking up with her was one of the easiest things I‚Äôve ever done. She made it incredibly easy and not heart breaking in the slightest. It‚Äôs crazy to think how in love with her I was but now I just feel repulsed. This was my first ever relationship and I feel like I've grown so much and matured tremendouosly. I feel like I now know my worth and what I want and don't want out of a relationship. I also feel my self respect has increased tremdendously as well. She was an amazing girl just sooooo inconsistent. Did she become uninterested? I just don't understand. Despite how busy my life was and or would be (working full time, school full time, hobbies, etc) I would always make time for her regardless of circumstance. I can say with confidence she would've never done that for me at the end of our relationship. Was it really her avoidant personality or something more? If more, why did she stay and leave me in the dark? Was it her problems at home? Why didn't she tell me that if so? Could I had done something differently? 

Despite how easy it was to break up with her, a part of me misses something. I don't think it's her. I'm no longer attracted to her as a person, and I wouldn't want to get back with her, but I miss being in a relationship, and sometimes I think I won't connect with someone better. We had such a strong bond and so many expereinces I will always appreciate. We built such a strong connection and I'm not sure if I'm ready to let go of the idea of her. She was my best friend and I loved her so many years. Will I truly find someone better or is she just going to be the one that got away in my life? Was this relationship a lesson more than anything? I know I will find someone better but it is tough to accept.

TLDR: Broke up with my ex of seven to eight months due to her lack of avalibity. I felt great and she made it super easy to break up with her when I did. I'm no longer in love but I sometimes feel I did the wrong thing.",0,1734635756.0,relationship_advice,5,0.5,False

He also lives a bit of a drive away and goes to a different school which was really hard for him even though I was okay with it. It was hard for us to have alone time because of our parents and it affected our physical and emotional intimacy. After the break up, I made it messy by wanting to stay together and after a few weeks of talking, he still didn‚Äôt want to. We completely stopped talking for about a month and then he texted me about how terrible he has been doing. He still wants to stay broken up for the remainder of school (roughly 6 months) because he is very overwhelmed right now but wants to be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. His definition of friends is checking in and texting a bit every few weeks and getting coffee occasionally. While it has been really hard for me, I am okay with all of this. BUT, I thought that he was completely done and now he‚Äôs making it sound like there‚Äôs a chance if we go to college in the same area. If we end up in the same city, he said that there is a really good chance that he would like to try again. But neither of us ever wanted long distance so it‚Äôs all a maybe depending on where we end up in college. We‚Äôre on good terms but I told him I wanted 1-2 months to just let myself process and work on myself before any type of ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù. I want to move on and be less sad about it ending but it‚Äôs hard to get over when there‚Äôs a possibility of us reconciling, even if it‚Äôs 6 months from now. I want to clarify that he is a very sweet guy and was mainly really good to me. We are both still a bit immature so I get that we weren‚Äôt perfect partners but I still would go for any chance I have with him. I made it clear that I didn‚Äôt want to be his friend to just be kept as an option for him and he said that‚Äôs not at all his intention, he just needs this time for himself. I really don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs doing this to see other people and think he just wants time to deal with everything he has going on. I am fine with all of this but how do I become okay right now when there‚Äôs is a chance that we could date again in half a year? There‚Äôs probably a 50/50 chance we‚Äôll end up in the same city for college so it‚Äôs really hard to know how to feel. I want to be okay with being single now but also allow myself to be ready if we are able to work it out in the future. How can I stop thinking about this so much and over analyzing? I want to take this time to become a better person but it‚Äôs hard when I‚Äôm always fantasizing about us working it out in the future. What do I do with all of my lovely gifts from him and pictures of us? I have a bouquet of origami flowers and huge cards and posters he‚Äôs given me and walking in my room is like seeing a display of every gift he‚Äôs given me. Please help.

I(F27) have been dating Adam (M28) for over 4 years now. We were friends in college, and grew close during the lockdown, and started dating right after. After going through a traumatic experience, I wasn't looking to date at the time, but it happened naturally and he pretty much lifted me out of depression. We're not very alike, but he was the greenest flag and I soon fell in love with him.
Our relationship has always been very easy-going. But some things were strange - he'd never introduce me to this friends or family, never called me over, never posted pictures of/with me - and he's never given me a proper reason, just that he's a private person. Fair enough. It bothered me but I didn't want to seem difficult and I thought every person is different, why ruin the peace over social media validation? But after 3 years, last year, I opened up to him and told him about how I would like to meet his friends and would want him to have at least one photo of me on his social media feed, as he has photos up with his friends as well. He finally invited me to hang out with one friend of his, and said he would soon post photos - but he hasn't so far. It's been a little over a year since I asked (and yes, I have reminded him a couple of times since, but he's always dodged it or said he would do it soon). Now this year has been really hectic for us as he started a new job, and I was promoted - long story short, we haven't had sex since Jan this year. We live in the same city, but we don't live together - so it's not like I have been withholding sex. I was unable to invite him over this year due to unavoidable circumstances. We met each other outside, though, whenever we could and spoke throughout the day, every single day. Two days ago, he asked to meet for coffee and said it wasn't working out. The next day, he said he doesn't want to break up but we need to have sex soon. His needs are valid, and I appreciate that he was honest instead of cheating on me, but something he said really disappointed me - he said he'd introduce me to his family only after the next time we have sex. And he would post a picture of us on his social media after 3 months (no reason why he needs 3 months).

I wanted to share something that happened to me recently. Someone gifted me $25, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how much more meaningful that is when you‚Äôre homeless compared to when you‚Äôre not.

When you‚Äôre housed and stable, $25 might mean a lunch out, a new book, or a tank of gas. But when you‚Äôre homeless, it‚Äôs SO much more. It‚Äôs a hot meal on a cold day, a small reprieve from the constant stress of survival, and the chance to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for a moment, like grabbing a coffee and sitting inside where it‚Äôs warm.

More than that, it‚Äôs a reminder that someone sees you, that you‚Äôre not invisible or forgotten. It‚Äôs not just about the money‚Äîit‚Äôs about the kindness, the humanity, and the hope it represents.

To everyone out there who extends kindness to someone in need: thank you. You might not realize just how far your small gesture can go, but I promise, it means everything.

We had the kind of friendship that was natural and you questioned if we were sisters. We were very different, but we helped the other in everything. I helped her in PE, she in English, I protected her from bullies, she helped me with mental issues - the point is, that the effort was mutual. I know I wasn't the perfect friend growing up, but I was always there when needed. Then we went to University, to the same school, I knew things would change, and that it would be extra hard for her, so I tried my best to help her and put much effort in. I checked up on her often, I grabbed her small gifts like a cookie and I offered so much help.

That was going on for two years when I realized that I felt neglected. I started to notice, that I texted her all the time but she never really texted me, she never asked about me, only talked about herself, and she never had time for me, even tho I asked for a two-minute convo, offered to grab her coffee and walk her to the classroom, and she was busy for that, but she hang out in the city with her roommate several times a week.

I knew uni would be hard academically, and she indeed had it harder since she had a harder major, but I started to feel like she just doen't want me around.

So I started letting her neglect me. I already was the only one putting in the effort, so I just gradually stopped, and I realized that if I wasn't putting the effort in, she wouldn't even text me. I understand it was hard for her but it was also hard for me. I've been through some serious stuff along the way and I needed someone to check up on me. But she didn't. And that hurt.

The summer I started matching her energy, she switched majors to an easier one, and for a moment it felt like she was back, she came to a couple parties but I got the same weird, hurtful energy from her as before. For her credit she tried to initiate a meet-up in the summer but when I went I felt so heartbroken, I had to make an excuse to leave. 

I think she doesn't know how I feel. Our mutual friends think I'm overreacting and holding a grudge, waiting for her to kneel down with a rose and apologize. I don't want that. I don't need an apology, and I certainly don't want to talk it out. I feel like there's nothing to talk out I just want to feel appreciated and loved by my friend. All I want is for her, to show me he still wants this friendship, maybe invite me to a hangout or just ask me how I'm doing, cuz I'm not doing fine and I feel like she doesn't even give a sht. She also did several hurtful things along the way, those were individually on the smaller side but piling up, they just hurt af.

Others think I'm the a-hole, and should just stop the drama and start putting in effort again. I feel like I SHOULD do something, but I also feel like she doesn't want me around anymore and it hurts.

US- Midwest

I see Harbor Freight has JUPITER 750 Watt Continuous/1500 Watt Peak Modified Sine Wave Power Inverters for about $70 USD

I have a 300 watt inverter in each of my vehicles for charging my laptop, running a coffee pot/hotplate in the field, and occasionally strings of LEDs when the kids soccer games run late.

But 300 watts isn‚Äôt much. For the price, the Jupiter sounds great considering it has 4 outlets.

Who here uses inverters often, what do you use it for, and what size/brand do you recommend?

I am playing around with the idea of opening a coffee cart in an area known for freezing temperatures all winter round. I'm still in the early stages of planning & budgeting, but one of my foremost concerns is what is even possible in sub-freezing conditions.



Ideally, I would be able to operate an above-counter machine with some extra care (draining boiler and tubes after service, keeping water source insulated, etc.) but does anyone have any first-hand experience or any theoretical expertise with something like this?

  
I'm aware of under the counter solutions like the modbar and mavam systems which could be kept in an insulated space, but those are far more expensive and I'd like to reserve those as last resort options.",2,1734634557.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Did titration from 10mg - 20mg - 30mg - 40mg. I felt like 40mg was pretty good, we tried 50mg, it made me feel horrible and we went back down to 40mg. 

That entire time I was working an office job Monday-Friday and 40mg was noticeable enough for me. I could focus on my work, especially one task at a time. I could stop mindlessly scrolling on my phone when I was supposed to be working. I even found that on the weekends I was still very focused and doing productive things, instead of just couch rotting and regretting it. I did notice that around 4pm I would start to crash, which was about 7-8 hours after taking my Vyvanse. My doctor tried 50mg again after I told her that, it was still too much, we went back down to 40mg which is where I‚Äôm at now. 

I was off work for two weeks at the end of September for vacation. Then came back for two weeks, then went on paid leave for the last two weeks of October. Then left my job the 1st of November, and I‚Äôve been off ever since. All together I‚Äôve been off 70 days straight. 

I‚Äôve been taking my meds pretty regularly all throughout this, I do skip random days when I don‚Äôt have anything at all to do. I can feel the difference when I skip the days, I‚Äôm overall pretty tired and usually end up taking a nap. I would assume it‚Äôs what most people feel like if they don‚Äôt drink coffee for a day (coffees never done anything for me hah) 

I definitely do still have many productive days where I‚Äôm getting things done around the house, but I also have a lot of just lounging doing nothing days because‚Ä¶ I worked hard in the past and I feel like I deserve a bit of rest while I‚Äôm off‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just at the point where I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs doing anything anymore? Or if maybe since I‚Äôm not sitting down and working like I used to, I just don‚Äôt notice it the same? 

Wonder if you guys have any thoughts? I have my next appointment on January 3rd - and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth bringing up. Or if I should just stick with the 40mg until I start working again and see what I‚Äôm feeling when I‚Äôm back in a structured work environment. ",2,1734634539.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

1hi01h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoolNewGadgets/comments/1hi01h7/my_experience_using_the_voltex_heated_vest_what/,My Experience Using the Voltex Heated Vest: What You Need to Know,"Winter can be brutal, especially if you're someone who dreads layering up just to stay warm. I stumbled upon the **Voltex Heated Vest** after endlessly searching for a way to avoid feeling like a walking marshmallow during the colder months. Now, after weeks of using it, I‚Äôm here to share what it‚Äôs like to own one‚Äînot a sales pitch, just the good, the bad, and the reality of wearing a heated vest.

# Why I Decided to Try It

I live in a place where winters mean freezing mornings and biting winds. Layering was my go-to, but the bulk was annoying. Jackets restrict movement, and once you're inside, it's too warm, making it an endless cycle of putting clothes on and taking them off.

When I first heard about heated vests, I thought they sounded gimmicky. But the **Voltex Heated Vest** stood out because of its lightweight design, machine washability, and heating zones targeted to your core areas. The NASA-inspired heating technology was also a curiosity factor for me.

# How It Works

The vest is powered by a USB-compatible battery (not included, more on that later). You plug your power bank into a USB port located in the pocket, hold the power button for three seconds, and it begins heating. There are three temperature settings:

* **Red Light (High):** 45¬∞C (113¬∞F)
* **White Light (Medium):** 35¬∞C (95¬∞F)
* **Blue Light (Low):** 25¬∞C (77¬∞F)

What impressed me most is how quickly it heats up‚Äîwithin seconds, you feel a noticeable warmth. The heating pads are located at strategic points: flanks, waist, mid-back, and neck, so the warmth feels evenly distributed.

# What I Liked About the Voltex Heated Vest

1. **Lightweight and Non-Bulky** The vest feels like any regular winter vest but provides constant warmth without the weight. I‚Äôve worn it under a light jacket and still felt cozy in near-freezing weather. It‚Äôs also easy to pack for trips.
2. **Customizable Heat Settings** Depending on the temperature, you can switch between the three heating levels. I usually keep it on the medium setting, which lasts a solid 6-7 hours with my 10,000mAh power bank.
3. **Durability and Weather Resistance** The vest is weatherproof, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about getting caught in light rain or snow. The materials feel durable, and the seams seem to hold up well even after several washes.
4. **Machine Washable** I was skeptical about how it would hold up in the washing machine, but it‚Äôs designed with water-safe carbon fiber wires. Just unplug the battery, toss it in, and let it air dry. So far, no issues after multiple washes.
5. **Great for All Activities** I‚Äôve worn it for hiking, shoveling snow, and even casual outdoor coffee runs. It works perfectly for all of them. The vest is breathable, so I never felt too hot or sweaty, even when I was active.
6. **Inclusive Sizing** I got the medium size, but it‚Äôs nice to know they offer sizes from XXS to 4XL. It‚Äôs unisex, so it fits well for both men and women.

# What Could Be Improved

1. **Battery Not Included** The biggest downside is that the vest doesn‚Äôt come with a power bank. You‚Äôll need one with at least 5V 2AMP output, which might not be the same as your regular phone charger. I ended up buying a compatible power bank separately, which was an added expense.
2. **Short Battery Life on High Heat** On the highest heat setting, the battery life drops significantly (around 3-4 hours). If you plan to use it for extended outdoor activities, you‚Äôll need a second battery.
3. **Preheating is Mandatory** When you turn it on, the vest starts with a 5-minute preheat phase at maximum heat before switching to medium. This is great for a quick warm-up, but it‚Äôs not adjustable, which some people might find inconvenient.

# Who Should Consider This Vest?

The **Voltex Heated Vest** is perfect for:

* Outdoor enthusiasts (hiking, skiing, snowboarding)
* People who work outside in the cold (construction, delivery drivers)
* Commuters tired of wearing bulky layers
* Anyone who struggles to stay warm indoors during winter

It‚Äôs not a complete replacement for a heavy winter coat in extreme conditions, but it‚Äôs an excellent layering option for staying warm without feeling weighed down.

# Key Features at a Glance

* **8 Heating Zones** for comprehensive warmth
* **Adjustable Heat Settings** for different temperature needs
* **Waterproof and Machine Washable** design
* **Lightweight and Breathable** fabric
* **Battery Life:** Up to 8 hours on the lowest setting
* **TSA-Friendly** for air travel

# What Surprised Me the Most

I didn‚Äôt expect how much I‚Äôd enjoy the even distribution of heat. Traditional jackets don‚Äôt really ""spread"" warmth; they just trap body heat. The **Voltex Heated Vest** actively generates warmth exactly where you need it. On cold mornings, this made all the difference‚Äîit was like carrying a personal heater around.

Another unexpected bonus was the style. I‚Äôve gotten compliments on how it looks, and people are usually surprised when I tell them it‚Äôs a heated vest. It doesn‚Äôt scream ""tech gadget"" and blends in with any winter outfit.

# Final Thoughts

The **Voltex Heated Vest** has been a game-changer for my winter experience. It‚Äôs practical, easy to use, and surprisingly versatile. While it‚Äôs not perfect, its benefits far outweigh the minor inconveniences. If you‚Äôre tired of freezing through the winter months, this vest might be worth a look.

1hi003z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrometheanWarCollege/comments/1hi003z/from_the_diary_of_chaos_007/,From the Diary of Chaos #007,"January the 22nd,

Yesterday was eventful. Still not certain what I make of it.

The day started with three cigarettes, a hot bath, and a cold shower.

Soon after, I broke my fast. Black coffee, sausage with onion gravy over a poorly seasoned mash, more cigarettes.

The final of the three jobs due for the Exchange was a simple courier job. The parcel in question arrived early that day and was left with the daytime bartender.

About the bartender, I do not care for him. He seems like a man who listens too closely so that he might speak too freely about things that do not concern him. Hopefully he will not prove to be a problem. I will not suffer a man with gluttonous ears and a loose tongue.

After breakfast I returned to my room. I would wait until evening to deliver the parcel. A routine I had repeated many times before.

The rain had become cumbersome by the time I exited the in. It had forced me to retrieve my rolltop bag from my luggage so as to store the parcel for the purpose of keeping it dry. I had also moved my pistol from my lower back to an inside coat pocket for easier access. The job had been described as low risk, but plenty of men had rolled those dice and come up short before. I wasn‚Äôt one for dice and I didn‚Äôt plan on joining them.

The walk was short, only about ten blocks, and soon I came to an old double wide brownstone. The stones were wet with rain, each step a soft echo against the damp street. I climbed the stoop and with one hand pressed the bell beside the large wooden door, the other hand tightly gripped the pistol in my jacket pocket.

The door soon opened and the warmth from the home was soon followed by the coldness of a man with a bushy mustache wearing a grey suit. The scent of tobacco and old leather came with him. He was a smaller man, smaller than myself anyway. He wore small round rimmed glasses in front of hard eyes. He held a lit wooden pipe in his hand, wisps of smoke curling from it like forgotten memories.

‚ÄúHow can I help you?‚Äù he asked, looking me up and down, clearly unimpressed.

‚ÄúDelivery for Gustav,‚Äù I said.

He nodded curtly, ‚ÄúI see. Come inside.‚Äù I obliged but my hand did not loosen around the pistol as I stepped through the threshold. ‚ÄúGustav is this way,‚Äù he said and gestured with his pipe to a room just off the foyer before leading the way.

He led me into a large older looking library, books lining the wall from floor to ceiling, a fireplace softly popping in the corner.

Two men were sitting around a large round table at the center of the room, one facing me and one facing away. They were smoking, drinking, and playing cards. These men did not look like threats. They certainly were not the standard clientele of the Exchange. The man facing me looked up from his cigar and grinned.

‚ÄúGustav, your friend is here.‚Äù

As I approached, the man facing away me turned from the table, his gaze effortlessly found my own. I stopped and as I stood there ‚Äì thanking any gods that may be that in my hand I was not holding two small silver coins as those had been left on a dresser, in the corner of a rented room, located on the outskirts of the small village of Jericho, only ten rainy blocks away ‚Äì he spoke:

‚ÄúHello, fellow traveler,‚Äù his voice calm, and warm, and smoldering like a low-burning campfire, ‚ÄúIts good to see you again.‚Äù

Gustav, if that was truly his name, was the same man I had seen by the lamppost, in the Dark Forest, in my dream.

What happened next is harder to explain.

My better judgement told me to pull the pistol from my jacket pocket and turn this night into a strange memory. My better judgement had served me well up to this point. But on this night, I did not listen.

I could not bring myself to listen.

The Dark Forest had been calling me.

I did not know how to return.

The man in front of me, Gustav, had been there. He must know how to return.

Gustav offered me a seat and I took it. I set the rolltop bag beside me, but I did not remove my coat or hat, and my hand did not stray from my pistol. He told me to be comfortable and with one hand I pulled a cigarette from my breast pocket and the man with the bushy mustache quickly lit it before returning to his seat.

Gustav introduced me to the others.

The man with the busy mustache and cold searching eyes was named Wilhelm. He proved to be the most unpredictable and dramatic of the bunch.

The third man at the table looked like he had been born as an older stoic Jewish man and hadn‚Äôt changed much since. His name was Mortimer. He seemed to be a bit of a personality buffer between the friendly Gustav and the moody Wilhelm. Without him, the other two might escape, each into their own little worlds.

We were soon joined at the table by another man who had been in adjoining room. This new man was sandy haired, spoke with a thick New England accent, and had a bandage on his head. His name was Fitz. He didn‚Äôt speak much. He didn‚Äôt seem to pay me much attention either. He looked like he was recovering. He simply sat and smoked.

Gustav said we might be joined by two more men, Cuthbert and Miller, who were out drinking, womanizing, arguing about words, and other far less important things. They did not show.

‚ÄúI believe you have a package for me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äù I said as I pulled my bag into my lap and retrieved the parcel. I handed it to Gustav.

‚ÄúYou know, this package is actually for you.‚Äù He said, considering the package in his hands. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll hold on to it for now,‚Äù he continued as he placed the package on the table in front of him.

‚ÄúLet us get to the point.‚Äù Wilhelm said, slamming his empty glass to the table.

And get to the point they did.

Gustav explained - if that is what you chose to call it - that they were part of a group called the Archive, and that they themselves were called Bookkeepers. They were also men who traveled to, from, and through the Dark Forest.

He would not answer any questions about the Archive.

He would not answer any questions about the Bookkeepers.

He would not answer any questions about the Dark Forest.

Soon, I stopped asking questions, save one:

‚ÄúHow do I return to the Dark Forest?‚Äù

Gustav explained that it was a process similar to a kind of deep self-hypnosis. It was also a process that, once proficiency was reached, was possible to do at will. The problem of course was becoming proficient.

He further explained that becoming proficient required an individual to expand their capacity. He contended that man was a tripartite being composed of three composite parts: Body, Mind, and Anima; that the Anima was the most important but that in order do that one must stretch the capacity of the Body and Mind first.

He explained that the Body was the foundation, the vessel for human consciousness and the instrument for manifestations of that consciousness.

The Mind was the intermediary between the Body and the Anima, and itself was bipartite in nature, composed of a Light side, and a Dark side.

The Anima was harder to explain, or at least harder for me to understand. He explained that there was a bridge between the Light and Dark side of the mind, and that a well-developed connection was required. He spoke about it for the longest amount of time but seemed to explain it the least.

He explained that in order to expand the capacity of the Mind, one must first expand the capacity of the Body. That in order to strengthen the connection between the Light and Dark side of the Mind, one must first expand both the Light and Dark side of the Mind. That in order to expand the Anima, one must first strengthen the connection between the Light and Dark side of the Mind.

Normally, I would have dismissed Gustav's words as the delusions of a madman.

It all sounded like shit to me.

But‚Ä¶

I had been to the Dark Forest.

I had felt the soil between my fingers.

I had seen the Lamppost.

Gustav had been there.

I still had two small silver coins sitting on the dresser, in the corner of a rented room, on the second floor of an Inn, on the outskirts of the Village of Jericho, ten rainy blocks away from the Brownstone which I now sat.

And I couldn't stop thinking about returning.

So, I sat, and I listened.

He told me they, the Bookkeepers, would help me expand my capacity if I desired it, but that the process wouldn‚Äôt be easy. He also told me he understood that I likely didn‚Äôt have the ability to turn them down. He said he knew exactly what the Dark Forest did to a man. How strong the call to return was. They all did. He explained that returning to the Dark Forest was the only way to calm the desire that had been growing deep in my heart.

He was right.

I couldn‚Äôt refuse.

I needed to return.

I accepted their help:

Wilhelm would help me expand the capacity of my Body.

Mortimer would help me expand the capacity of my Mind.

Gustav would help me expand the capacity of my Anima.

Fitz did not offer help. He simply sat and smoked.

Gustav handed me a piece of paper and a pen began to dictate to me a list of works I would need to collect. I‚Äôm not sure what I expected, if I had any expectations at all, but if they existed, his list subverted it. I recognized some of the names as fiction novels, one name I recognized as a television program, the others I did not recognize.

Mortimer had stood and looked over my shoulder as I wrote, ‚ÄúNo, that simply wont do,‚Äù he said as he turned to a bookcase retrieved a few volumes and then turned to a desk.

‚ÄúGrab him a few sketchbooks as well, wont you Mortimer.‚Äù Gustav said as he smoked deeply from his pipe.

Mortimer handed me several old volumes, a few pens, the sketchbooks, and a tin of pencils. ‚ÄúYou can tell a good deal about the quality of mans mind by the quality of his handwriting. You‚Äôre going to want to address that.‚Äù

It is true, as this diary plainly shows, that my handwriting is nothing to admire. How improving this will help me return to the Dark Forest, I do not know.

Gustav went on to explain that the list he had dictated to me was art that I would need to consume and engage with. That in order to learn what I would need to learn; I would need to fill my mind with a certain set of specific ideas. After I had done that, I would need to deeply consider those ideas. And that after I had done that, I would need to find a meaningful way to express those ideas.

It all sounded like shit to me.

I asked how long it would take to work through his list. He told me he did not know. He said the sooner I started the sooner I would finish.

He went on to explain that Mortimer and Wilhelm would provide me with more tasks as I worked through the list. That once I had completed the list and tasks provided by the other men, I would be billeted at the Brownstone. For now, I would need to stay at the Inn.

They said they had little else to share with me but that if I liked, I could stay to smoke and play cards. I declined their offer. I told them I needed to sit and think. They nodded in understanding.

I took the list and the items Mortimer had given me and placed them into the rolltop bag.

Wilhelm walked me to the door.

The rain had stopped.

I'm 20 and recently moved to Bremen from Turkey. I'd love to meet new people who are open-minded and enjoy good conversations or just hanging out.

Here's a bit about me: :>

- I'm learning German right now, but I can communicate in English (though it's not perfect). 
- I'm gay. This doesn't define who I am as a friend, but I prefer not to be around homophobic people-just putting it out there to avoid any awkwardness.
- I love exploring new places, walking around the city, and trying new activities.
- I love going to the cinema, watching films. Subjects like filmmaking and art interest me :>
- I'm generally chill guy and more on the introverted side. I might seem quiet at first, but once we get along, people say I'm easy to vibe with.

If you're up for meeting, feel free to send me a message!üôåüèª

OK, just to give you an idea of the kind of things I enjoy, I would totally do with a close friend if they were here right now:

- just chatting at a cafe and drinking coffee 
- Walking around the city while talking
- Exploring other cities
- Making a vision board for 2025, with music and wine, and chatting about goals

1hhzwcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/1hhzwcf/why_cant_i_find_a_partner_27f/,Why can't I find a partner? (27F),"I moved to a new city about two years ago, and despite the change, building a social life and making new friends hasn‚Äôt been difficult at all. I often attend events, take English classes, have changed jobs a few times, and have plenty of hobbies and interests that allow me to meet new people. I don‚Äôt consider myself boring or monotonous, and I‚Äôve never had trouble communicating or forming connections.

However, finding a meaningful relationship seems like an unattainable goal. I‚Äôve also tried dating apps, but the experience has been disappointing. Getting matches has never been an issue, as women are in the minority, but the conversations often fizzle out quickly: many people don‚Äôt reply, respond with monosyllables, or leave the entire conversation up to me. When it comes to meeting for a coffee, there‚Äôs often no chemistry, or we simply have nothing interesting to talk about. I can‚Äôt help but wonder: is this normal?

On top of that, it‚Äôs common for people to ask to move the conversation to Instagram. However, even there, it feels like starting over, and I find myself waiting in vain for any sign of initiative or interest from the other person. I don‚Äôt mind making the first move, but the complete lack of proactivity on their part is discouraging.

For instance, this summer, I dated a guy I met on a dating app for a couple of months. He was very attractive but extremely boring, with no particular interests and a very different outlook on life from mine. Despite my efforts, I felt we had nothing in common, and the relationship ended without leaving anything meaningful behind.

I‚Äôd like to understand if I‚Äôm doing something wrong, if there‚Äôs something I could approach differently, or simply hear feedback from others to know if I‚Äôm the only one experiencing this.",4,1734633905.0,TooAfraidToAsk,2,0.84,False
1hhzvz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/rootsofprogress/comments/1hhzvz0/a_progress_policy_agenda/,A progress policy agenda,"Elon Musk says that soon, builders ‚Äú[will be free to build](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854023551575322959)‚Äù in America. If that promise is to be fulfilled, we have work to do.

Here‚Äôs my wishlist of policy goals to advance scientific, technological, and economic progress. I‚Äôm far from a policy wonk, so I‚Äôm mostly going to be referencing folks I trust, such as the [RPI fellows](https://rootsofprogress.org/fellows), the Institute for Progress (IFP), or Eli Dourado at the Abundance Institute. (I‚Äôm sympathetic to most of what is linked below, and consider all of it interesting and worthwhile, but don‚Äôt assume I agree with anything 100%.)

# AI

AI has enormous potential to create prosperity and security for America and the world. It also introduces new risks and enhances old ones. However, I think it would be a mistake to create a new [review-and-approval process](https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/against-review-and-approval) for AI.

* [Dean Ball outlines his preferred approach and priorities here](https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/heres-what-i-think-we-should-do). See also his [warnings about ‚Äúuse-based‚Äù AI regulation](https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/what-comes-after-sb-1047) and about [the ‚Äúonslaught of state bills‚Äù coming](https://www.piratewires.com/p/america-is-sleepwalking-into-a-permanent-dei-bureaucracy-regulating-ai).
* Jack Clark and Gillian Hadfield [propose ‚Äúregulatory markets‚Äù for AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04914), worth considering.
* I think a crucial piece is getting liability right‚Äîgood liability laws, plus an insurance requirement, would go a long way toward market-based safety. See [this interview with Gabriel Weil](https://axrp.net/episode/2024/04/17/episode-28-tort-law-for-ai-risk-gabriel-weil.html).

# Permitting reform

Reform NEPA and other permitting rules so we can build infrastructure again:

* Eli Dourado has written extensively on this, see [his NYT editorial](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/opinion/politics/we-need-to-build-our-way-out-of-this-mess.html) for an overview. He also wrote an excellent [primer on NEPA](https://www.thecgo.org/benchmark/much-more-than-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-nepa/) and has suggested [some reforms to scale it back](https://www.thecgo.org/research/bringing-nepa-back-to-basics/).
* [Michael Catanzaro says](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/we-dont-need-this-much-permitting) we need to distinguish between *permitting* and *compliance:* what matters is whether projects follow the law, not whether they promise to in advance. He outlines an alternative, ‚Äúpermit-by-rule,‚Äù in which permitting is simple, reviews are limited to 90 days, projects are approved by default if not reviewed in time, and the emphasis is on complying with substantive requirements rather than procedural ones. (Related, see [IFP on substantive vs. procedural environmental regulation](https://ifp.org/moving-past-environmental-proceduralism/).)
* IFP has a [major focus on infrastructure](https://ifp.org/category/infrastructure/) with many helpful reports. They advocate, for instance, [putting a time limit on injunctive relief to end the ‚Äúlitigation doom loop.‚Äù](https://ifp.org/we-must-end-the-litigation-doom-loop/) They have a [review of other NEPA reform proposals here](https://ifp.org/a-cheat-sheet-for-nepa-judicial-reform/).
* At the state level, the Foundation for American Innovation has recently published a [State Permitting Playbook](https://www.thefai.org/posts/the-state-permitting-playbook).
* At the intersection of infrastructure and AI, see also IFP‚Äôs series on [how to build the next generation of compute infrastructure in America](https://ifp.org/compute-in-america/).
* For energy permitting in particular, RPI fellow Grant Dever has [a recent white paper with recommendations](https://freopp.org/whitepapers/federal-energy-reforms-to-ensure-grid-reliability-encourage-competition-and-combat-inflation/).

# YIMBY

Reform local zoning and permitting and generally fight NIMBYism so we can build housing again. The YIMBY movement is extensive, so I‚Äôll only give a small and not necessarily representative sample:

* Organizations: [CA YIMBY](https://cayimby.org/), [YIMBY Action](https://yimbyaction.org/) (where RPI fellow [Jeff Fong](https://www.urbanproxima.com/) is a board member), [Metropolitan Abundance Project](https://www.metroabundance.org/) (MAP), [Up for Growth](https://upforgrowth.org/)
* MAP‚Äôs collection of [model legislation](https://www.metroabundance.org/legislation/)
* Nolan Gray‚Äôs book [*Arbitrary Lines*](https://www.amazon.com/Arbitrary-Lines-Zoning-Broke-American-ebook/dp/B09ZRXX22M)
* [Single-stair reform](https://www.niskanencenter.org/understanding-single-stair-reform-efforts-across-the-united-states/), a cause promoted by the [Center for Building North America](https://www.centerforbuilding.org/)
* RPI fellow Ryan Puzycki‚Äôs campaign to [relax zoning requirements](https://www.ryanpuzycki.com/p/the-next-step-toward-a-walkable-city) to allow some businesses (such as coffee shops) in residential areas‚Äîwhich he just got passed in Austin!

Jerusalem Demsas also does good reporting on these issues at *The Atlantic*‚Äîfor a spicy take, see her piece ‚Äú[Community Input Is Bad, Actually](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/local-government-community-input-housing-public-transportation/629625/).‚Äù

# Nuclear

Energy is central to industrial progress, and nuclear power is an abundant, reliable, clean form of energy. For several decades, nuclear has been paralyzed by a regulatory regime that does not balance costs and benefits, and an NRC that doesn‚Äôt see the development of energy as its job.

* The book *Why Nuclear Power Has Been a Flop* has several concrete suggestions, which I summarized in [my review](https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/devanney-on-the-nuclear-flop).
* The Breakthrough Institute has a long series of [articles and reports on nuclear](https://thebreakthrough.org/energy/advanced-nuclear); see for instance ‚Äú[How to Make Nuclear Cheap](https://thebreakthrough.org/articles/how-to-make-nuclear-cheap)‚Äù and ‚Äú[How to Make Nuclear Innovative](https://thebreakthrough.org/articles/how-to-make-nuclear-innovative).‚Äù
* IFP‚Äôs Brian Potter also has [a report on nuclear costs and potential solutions](https://ifp.org/nuclear-power-plant-construction-costs/).

# Supersonic

Supersonic passenger flight is banned outright over land in the US and many other countries:

* Eli Dourado and Sam Hammond wrote [a report and proposal on this](https://www.mercatus.org/research/research-papers/make-america-boom-again) in 2016 recommending that the FAA rescind the ban.
* More recently, Eli has suggested that [Congress needs to step in to legalize supersonic](https://www.thecgo.org/benchmark/congress-should-legalize-supersonic-flight/). See also his followup essay, ‚Äú[50 Years of Silence](https://www.elidourado.com/p/50-years-supersonic-ban).‚Äù

# FDA

To approve a new drug takes (order-of-magnitude) a decade and a billion dollars. This is too high a burden. Alex Tabarrok has written of the ‚Äú[invisible graveyard](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/08/is-the-fda-too-conservative-or-too-aggressive.html)‚Äù this creates, and [criticized the FDA‚Äôs performance during covid](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/03/fda-postpones-inspections-delaying-new-drugs-and-creating-shortages-of-old-drugs.html) specifically. I also like [Scott Alexander‚Äôs take](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/adumbrations-of-aducanumab), including his followups [part 2](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/details-of-the-infant-fish-oil-story) and [part 3](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/contra-drum-on-the-fish-oil-story).

* A Mercatus paper suggests [four models for FDA reform](https://www.mercatus.org/research/policy-briefs/need-fda-reform-four-models), including competing approval bodies, international reciprocity, and right-to-try.
* Tabarrok and Dan Klein wrote an earlier [report for the Independent Institute](https://www.fdareview.org/issues/reform-options/) with five recommendations that overlap with the above. This is their compromise solution; they also describe what they call ‚Äú[the sensible alternative](https://www.fdareview.org/issues/the-sensible-alternative-the-voluntary-provision-of-assurance/),‚Äù which is a combination of voluntary practices and tort remedy.

# Prediction markets

A new kind of financial market allows investors to trade futures on the outcome of events. The positive externality of these markets is that the price of a future reflects the market-weighted assessment of its probability, with strong incentives to get the answer right, and with a feedback loop that rewards the best predictors.

This kind of market is regulated by the CFTC, but the rules are onerous enough that so far only one prediction market, [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/), [has been approved in the US](https://kalshi.com/blog/article/kalshi-designation). Others are [not technically legal in the US](https://polymarket.com/), or they [use a point system with no monetary value](https://manifold.markets/), which doesn‚Äôt bring the full power of a financial market to bear on making predictions. Even Kalshi has faced a legal battle to create [election markets](https://kalshi.com/blog/article/on-regulated-election-markets). Regulators should create a clear and sensible pathway to legal money-based prediction markets in the US.

# Cryptocurrency

The SEC has brought dozens of enforcement actions against crypto projects. Crypto has, let us say, more than its share of scams and fraud, but many perceive that the SEC under Gensler is going beyond protecting investors to simply attacking all crypto.

Matt Levine, for instance, who is certainly no crypto booster, [points out](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-11-06/the-trump-trades-worked?srnd=undefined) that the SEC is pursuing Coinbase for operating an illegal exchange, even though Coinbase is ‚Äúpretty much the exact sort of crypto exchange that US regulators should want‚Äîa US-based, publicly listed, audited, compliance-focused, not-particularly-leveraged one.‚Äù He concludes that it looks as if ‚Äúthe SEC‚Äôs goal is not to protect crypto investors but to prevent crypto investment.‚Äù

There should be a regulatory pathway to operate legal crypto projects in the US.

* I don‚Äôt know of any proactive policy proposals for this, but [Stand with Crypto](https://www.standwithcrypto.org/) rates candidates and bills for crypto-friendliness.

# Immigration

Expand high-skilled immigration, such as the O-1 and H-1B. We need more entrepreneurs, more future Nobel laureates, more skilled workers to run chip fabs. Just a few example ideas here:

* IFP has a set of articles and reports on [high-skilled immigration](https://ifp.org/category/high-skilled-immigration/)
* Noah Smith and Minn Kim say that [skilled immigration is a national security priority](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/skilled-immigration-is-a-national)
* The Economic Innovation Group has a proposal called [Heartland Visas](https://eig.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Heartland-Visas-Report.pdf)
* RPI fellow Connor O‚ÄôBrien advocates an idea called [Global EIR](https://www.cojobrien.com/p/one-weird-trick-to-attract-startups)

(IMO there are other worthy immigration causes as well, but high-skilled immigration is the most clearly relevant to progress, the most agreed-on within the progress movement, and the most politically feasible in the near term, so I‚Äôm focusing on it here.)

# Government efficiency

Prioritize competence, efficiency, and results in government. DOGE should check out:

* Jen Pahlka‚Äôs [Recoding America](https://www.recodingamerica.us/). Also her [recent essay on DOGE](https://www.eatingpolicy.com/p/bringing-elon-to-a-knife-fight), in which she describes how even small reforms run into ‚Äúa perplexing combination of legitimate and imagined reasons for caution, and review by a staggering array of stakeholders‚Äù
* Misha Chellam‚Äôs [Abundance Network](https://www.abundancenetwork.com/)
* Dan Lips, Sam Hammond, and Thomas Hochman‚Äôs [Efficiency Agenda](https://www.thefai.org/posts/an-efficiency-agenda-for-the-executive-branch) whitepaper
* Philip Howard‚Äôs [Common Good](https://www.commongood.org/)

# Science funding

Our institutions of science funding are also in need of reform. I summarized the criticisms in the middle of [this essay](https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/accelerating-science-through-evolvable-institutions): The grant process is slow and high-overhead. It is also conservative, encouraging incremental results that can be published frequently, and making it hard to make bold bets on research that might not show legible progress right away. It increasingly gives funding to older researchers. Scientists are overly constrained by their funding, lacking the scientific freedom to guide their research as they best see fit. I have also written about [the problems with the principal investigator model](https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/the-block-funding-model-for-science).

* IFP has a [Metascience](https://ifp.org/category/metascience/) cause area with many recommendations
* Ben Reinhardt suggests [a portfolio of independent research organizations](https://ifp.org/fund-organizations-not-projects-diversifying-americas-innovation-ecosystem-with-a-portfolio-of-independent-research-organizations/)
* Adam Marblestone and Sam Rodriquez recommend a new model called [Focused Research Organization (FRO)](https://fas.org/publication/focused-research-organizations-to-accelerate-science-technology-and-medicine/) (Adam now funds FROs through his organization Convergent Research)

See more from the [Good Science Project](https://goodscienceproject.org/).

# And there‚Äôs more

Causes suggested to me by others, but that I don‚Äôt have time/scope for here, include:

* Problems with [energy transmission](https://climateer.substack.com/p/transmission) not covered by permitting reform or nuclear reform
* Improvements to public transit; see the work of [RPI fellow Andrew Miller](http://www.changinglanesnewsletter.com/)
* Federal restraints on [reproductive/fertility treatment and research](https://press.asimov.com/articles/ivf-history)

There are probably many more, please leave comments with more ideas!

My husband and I have an amazing 14 month old girl. We didn‚Äôt plan the pregnancy but had been together for 10+ years and had been married for 5 when we found out I was pregnant. At the same time, we moved across the country because I was offered a one-year position that paid much better (in a lower col area). We moved into a house my MIL owns to help her fix it up, which we learned was basically abandoned for 8 years when we arrived there and in much worse shape than she realized. It took months for it to be livable, and it still has a lot of issues with plumbing and leaks (and bugs/vermin that the moisture invited). 

Our plan was always to live here temporarily and move out once I got a full time job. My husband is a therapist, and we are barely making ends meet with his income and my gig work. I have been unemployed since April; I‚Äôm in a specialized field and have gotten interviews but no offers. If it was just the two of us, I‚Äôd get a service industry job, but I can‚Äôt find one that pays enough to cover childcare let alone increase our income. 

The stress of the situation is affecting both of us. I feel depressed and frustrated by my job search and being a SAHP. He works very hard (generally 9-6 with some breaks throughout the day) and helps with chores and the baby on his work from home days. The stress is taking a toll on him, and I feel he really takes that out on me. When he works in the office or goes on business trips, our daughter has separation anxiety and acts out. It‚Äôs very hard for me to get chores done when she‚Äôs clingy and bored and fighting sleep. I manage our budget, cook our meals, and grocery shop, but I usually can‚Äôt clean up the house and dishes as well without help. On top of that, our daughter‚Äôs nap and after she goes to bed (and odd hours over the weekend) are the only times I can apply to jobs, do freelance work, exercise, etc‚Ä¶let alone relax. He doesn‚Äôt get much exercise or relaxation either; it‚Äôs hard on both of us.

Even though I‚Äôm having a hard time, I try to hold it together for our daughter. I prioritize her needs and sleep schedule even if it means that I can‚Äôt get to housework. But my husband has a meltdown whenever the house is messy. Yesterday was a hard day for me, and when I my husband asked how my day was and I started to describe it, he yelled at me and said that he listens to people complain all day and couldn‚Äôt deal with it from me too. And he was upset that our mold gnats got worse again. 

When my husband got up this morning, he freaked out about the flies and three our coffee grinder and broke it with beans flying everywhere (in front of our daughter, who started crying). All day he has been distressed and saying he ruined his life living in this house, that he‚Äôs a bad provider, a failure, etc. I love him but have no idea what I can do to help him. And practically I need him to be more chill and hold it together for our family/household harmony. He is good at his job and his business is going well‚Äîthings are just really hard in this economy, and we need two incomes to get by. I am hopeful that things will improve even though I feel hopeless sometimes, but I don‚Äôt have the bandwidth to just accept my husband‚Äôs anger and doom and gloom attitude while also trying to take care of a toddler and house and job search. 

He told me this morning that if it was just the two of us he would leave. He threatens to leave a lot but I really don‚Äôt think he wants to, as he can‚Äôt run away from himself you know? I have the intense urge to tell him to buck up and act right but I know that will just make things worse and maybe he would leave and make all three of us miserable. 

Am I being unreasonable that his attitude is upsetting me? Do your wives/partners manage to keep the house together perfectly while being SAHPs? Am I just bad at this? What can I do to support my husband without destroying myself with lack of sleep and bottling up my emotions?",41,1734633749.0,daddit,47,0.97,False

In general, I love WFH. It's a great fit for me and my life and health. I don't normally have problems with time management or concentration. I typically get my work done quickly, but I have really been struggling the last few weeks with focus. I know it's mainly because I haven't taken a vacation in a while, our end of year projects have been stressful, and both my body and brain need that break. (Thankfully, I have the next two weeks off and am looking forward to the much needed R&R!)

I've let a bunch of small tasks go and now I'm up on some deadlines to get these things done by end of day tomorrow (Friday) or Monday at the latest. Rationally, I know I have to do them, and I know I'll feel so much better once they're done. The ridiculous part is that none of them are actually difficult or time consuming, but it's as though I just have this mental block and can't break through it. I've never felt this level of burnout, even though, in general, I really love my job. 

Unfortunately, while I'm not restricted to working from home and would normally go to a coffee shop or something, these current tasks on my plate require phone calls, mini video chat meetings, and private information, so I really need to stay home to do them.

Help! What do you do to get your mojo back and get motivated or energized to buckle down and get shit done? (I know, I know. I need to just put on my big girl panties and do it. But it's not working today!)

I‚Äôm working on a project for a coffee brand that‚Äôs deeply rooted in heritage, and I‚Äôd love your creative input to design a series of teaser posts (2‚Äì3) and a revealer campaign to build excitement before the shop officially launches.

The brand is filled with cultural stories, and we wish to showcase those in a way that elicits curiosity, feels genuine, and creates a memorable experience.

Here's what makes this brand special:

 The Branding & Aesthetic

*   **Cultural Inspiration:** The brand has a deep draw from Yemeni heritage. Yemen is thought to be the origin of coffee, and the brand celebrates that legacy through storytelling elements tied directly to that history.
*   **Royal Motif:** In addition, the branding is supported by the idea of a Yemeni queen from ancient history, which reflects notions of beauty, power, and culture.
*   **Design Style:** It will maintain earthy tones like brown and beige, along with minimum illustrations and patterns based on Yemeni landmarks, cultural motifs, and old South Arabian letters or ancient scripts.
*   **In-Store Design:** The shop incorporates these old scripts and architectural elements in a stone-like, textured style, reminiscent of the iconic stone and mudbrick buildings found in Yemen‚Äôs ancient cities.

### What We‚Äôre Trying to Do

We‚Äôre planning a teaser campaign (2‚Äì3 posts) to spark curiosity and get people talking about the brand before revealing the full identity and concept. After the teasers, we‚Äôll move into a revealer campaign that showcases the shop in all its glory.

The challenge is to design campaigns that:

1.  Stay true to the brand‚Äôs rich cultural and historical roots.
2. Create an interesting, modernized highlighting of Yemen as the birthplace of coffee.
3. Be mysterious and captivating without losing the modern audience's touch.
4. Represent the uniqueness of the shop's heritage and storytelling with graphics.
  

### What I Need Help With

1hhzlf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/anxiety_support/comments/1hhzlf6/everyday_habits_that_might_be_secretly_triggering/,Everyday Habits That Might Be Secretly Triggering Your Anxiety,"Anxiety is sneaky. It doesn‚Äôt always come from the big, obvious things like stressful jobs or life-changing events. Often, it‚Äôs the *little habits* we don‚Äôt even think about‚Äîsmall, everyday actions that build up and keep us in a cycle of stress and overthinking.  

I didn‚Äôt realize this for years. I kept wondering why I felt so tense all the time, even when nothing major was wrong. It was only after I started paying attention to the details of my daily routine that things started to make sense.  

### Here‚Äôs the thing:  
Most people are unknowingly feeding their anxiety through habits that seem harmless. Once you recognize them, you‚Äôll realize how much control you actually have over your mental state.  

Let‚Äôs break it down.  

---

### **1. Constantly Checking Your Phone**  
We all do it. Scrolling through social media, refreshing emails, or diving into TikTok for ""just five minutes."" But every notification, every post, and every comparison we make adds to a feeling of unease. Your brain never gets a break.  

**How to Spot This Trigger:**  
Notice how you feel after a 10-minute scroll. More often than not, you'll feel restless, distracted, or even inadequate‚Äîfuel for anxiety.  

---

### **2. Drinking Caffeine (Even if You Think It‚Äôs Helping You Stay Focused)**  
That morning cup of coffee? It feels like a lifeline, but for many of us, caffeine is a sneaky culprit. It ramps up your heart rate and creates physical symptoms that mimic anxiety.  

**The Harsh Reality:**  
You might think, *""I can't function without it,""* but in truth, it's adding to your stress load.  

---

### **3. Overthinking Your To-Do List**  
Here‚Äôs the trap: You write down 10 things, only manage to finish two, and then spiral into thoughts like, *""I‚Äôm so unproductive,""* or *""Why can‚Äôt I just get it together?""* This creates a never-ending loop of guilt and worry.  

**What You Don‚Äôt Realize:**  
You‚Äôre setting yourself up to fail with unrealistic expectations.  

---

### **4. Avoiding Rest Because ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs Too Much to Do‚Äô**  
Ever tell yourself, *""I‚Äôll relax once everything‚Äôs done""?* That‚Äôs the problem. Everything is *never* done. Skipping rest is like running a marathon without water‚Äîit‚Äôs unsustainable and makes anxiety worse.  

---

### **5. Saying ‚ÄúYes‚Äù When You Mean ‚ÄúNo‚Äù**  
This one hits hard. You‚Äôre not a bad person for setting boundaries, but when you say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to everyone else, you‚Äôre saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to yourself. That kind of self-neglect feeds resentment and anxiety.  

---

### **How Do You Break the Cycle?**  
Here‚Äôs the truth: Awareness is step one, but breaking free from anxiety requires more than just knowing what triggers it. You need tools, strategies, and support to rewire your habits and reclaim your peace.  

I get it‚Äîthis can feel overwhelming. But imagine waking up and feeling calm, confident, and in control. That‚Äôs not a fantasy‚Äîit‚Äôs possible, and you don‚Äôt have to do it alone.  

If you‚Äôre ready to take back control, I‚Äôve found something that helped me, and it might help you too.

Just wanted to first say thanks to u/Short-Engineering-89 for the Chrome Extension, will be sending a coffee over in a second for the help in booking both my exams. It was stupid competitive to get slots and I was originally stupidly annoyed at myself for failing the first time but luckily managed to book another slot exactly after the 10 working day restriction DVSA sets when you fail a test.

I really thought I failed the second time, my nerves were a lot higher for some reason. Had to do the pull up on the right and reverse 2 car lengths maneuver and cars kept coming up and down the road. Examiner said I was overly cautious in my observation and I didn't get the minor for forgetting to put the car back in drive to pull off. (Did all my checks again from right to left when the car went backwards after I did my first check LOL)

Not really sure what else to say other than thanks to my instructor, super happy about the outcome and it really is a massive relief finally getting my licence! I started out learning manual during COVID but then COVID sort of boomed me out of bothering to learn how to drive so I didn't even take my theory test until recently either.

1hhzhle,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/1hhzhle/muscle_fatigue_stealth_gameplay/,Muscle Fatigue & Stealth Gameplay,"First things first: I'm glad to see b41 unstable and can't wait to see the rest of the features that are still coming down the pipe. I think this is a great step in the right direction for the game!

Muscle strain is shaping up to be a controversial mechanic. Most arguments have unfortunately focused on realism, instead of the effects on gameplay. People discussing it in gameplay terms have mixed feelings. Some praise the system for bringing a survival-horror feel back to the early game, slowing down the first progression steps, and reducing the viability of combat with hordes. Others criticize it for adding more tedium to the game by slowing down the process of clearing zombies and requiring long rest periods with little to do.

To put my biases out on the table, I would prefer Project Zomboid be survival-horror by default. I would be happy with a Zomboid in which hordes above a certain size are a permanent threat that can only be addressed with heavy firepower, a playstyle oriented around stealth, combat-avoidance, and escaping from zombies rather than killing them. I want to play as Glenn from The Walking Dead, not Frank West from Dead Rising. I want sandbox options to make the horde-slaying playstyle possible, but it's not what I want from the default settings. I suspect that this perspective is shared by TiS, and the combat changes in B42 unstable reflect that.

With that out of the way: **I like the muscle strain mechanic, but I think it's attempting to force a stealth-based playstyle that the game does not facilitate.**

If we are to avoid combat to solve all our problems, then the alternative must be stealth and evasion. Sneak around the zombies and kill them in a more stamina efficient manner (short blade takedowns) or attract zombies, lead them away, and escape from them. I think this would be a great change if the game had mechanics to support either stealth or evasion.

Let's start by discussing stealth. First of all, light, fog, and cover matter now. That's a fantastic step in the right direction! In addition, noise-based stealth is fairly interactive and can be optimized well even with no levels in sneak or light footed. [Crouching without shoes](https://youtu.be/Pm8AjN6OzFk?si=SZc-xaXIlBvFi6pS) provides a small enough noise radius to be stealthy, even in some cramped situations.[ Visual stealth](https://youtu.be/GqNbaCQ2JLM?si=5a2x_Wgml80o0edP) is a different story. Even while sneaking, even with the inconspicuous trait, you are very likely to be spotted within 19-ish tiles while moving between even 2-tile gaps in cover. This is a long enough distance that visual stealth inside of buildings may be basically impossible. This is particularly important now that zombie spawns are concentrated in buildings, not outdoors. Combine this with idle zombies who never move their heads, and you have a stealth system that mostly consists of crouch-walking without shoes while hoping the zombies aren't looking in your direction.

Next, let's talk zombie AI and pathing. Currently I see three major problems: zombies follow every stimulus straight through all obstacles, their pathfinding is both unintuitive and exploitable, and groups don't act as groups. Because zombies follow all sounds, breaking down windows and doors in the process, player detection often results in an exercise in leading zombies into destructible objects to keep them occupied even when a clear path to the player exists. Zombie pathing, [as detailed here](https://youtu.be/9SPu-Ki3vPI?si=y7XOPHklwy6Jpv3W), is difficult to escape if you don't understand it but easily exploitable if you do. It's easy to tuck 50 zombies behind a house and just leave if you understand it. The fact that groups don't act as groups encourages further video-gamey ""aggro pulling"" to peel off individuals from groups to avoid confronting the entire group: optimal, but hardly cinematic or challenging.

Finally, let's talk about evasion. First, I think the fence-vaulting and climbing are great examples of movement mechanics I'd like to see expanded on. However, they face two problems: they are passive and situational to the outdoors. By passive, I mean they have no player skill. Sprint into a fence and you'll jump it, your chance of success dependent entirely on your character's nimbleness and chance. The other problem is that these are only useful outdoors. Most indoor furniture tiles totally block movement, making indoor spaces extremely cramped. Your nimble sprinter character indoors is likely to be trapped behind a dining table or waist-high countertop, blocked from escape by a couch and a coffee table. Adding the ability to jump on top of these items (which I understand would be a major challenge to implement) would add some welcome utility to mobility-built characters.

In sum, the game wants us to treat it as a stealth-focused combat avoidance simulator, especially in the early game and in urban environments. However, it lacks the mechanics to support stealth gameplay more complicated than keeping your distance, especially inside buildings where the majority of zombies now are. The viable alternative is instead to exploit zombie pathing to herd groups outside and ditch them behind buildings. Here are some approaches that I'd like to see, which I think would be an efficient use of dev time to improve the core gameplay:

**Stealth**

1. Let us throw objects to create distracting sounds. The single most effective addition.
2. Make furniture and other low cover objects even more effective and ensure in future map updates that interior areas have enough cover to enable sneaking around inside.
3. Let us hide inside cupboards and wardrobes, and under tables and beds.
4. Integrate a visual camouflage system that reduces visual detection based on clothing and makeup. Ideally different biomes benefit from different camo: hunter's camo might work better in woods, while dark/grey clothing works better in urban areas. This is also a good application of makeup and facepaint.
5. Change zombie detection and aggro; detailed later.
6. Improve the consistency of knife takedowns from behind, and back-attacks in general.
7. Add noisy ground debris, like broken glass, dry leaves, trash, etc, to create a risk of making noise while sneaking around that can be avoided by aware players.

**Zombie AI**

1. Change from a binary idle/chasing state to a include levels between. Zombies alerted by noises or brief glimpses, or who reached the last-seen location of a player they're chasing, should be agitated and wander randomly for a time. Their agitation could be measured on a scale which is influenced by the amount of noise or length of time a player is spotted, thus providing a gentler punishment for spotted players. The agitation decreases over time until the zombie returns to idling. There's a reason every stealth game uses a patrolling / searching / chasing AI framework: it facilitates good stealth gameplay. It also makes more sense for dumb zombies than intelligent guards.
2. Just fix the pathing AI. It needs work. Stop tracking the player for several seconds after they leave sight. Drop the infinite range visual spotting when they check for you.
3. When zombies alert, they should make a noise which attracts nearby zombies (within about 3 tiles). This would draw in groups, preventing peeling single zombies away to whittle down groups.

**Evasion**

1. Add a ""jump"" or ""movement"" button. This button is required to vault low obstacles while sprinting. This could also be used for climbing on furniture, hiding, or crawling under objects. Zombies can climb under cars, why not us?
2. Understanding that this would be a big demand on the animation and probably fuck with the way furniture is actually stored and rendered - let us climb over furniture. Please. I should be able to hop a couch, and frankly so should the zombies.",1,1734632841.0,projectzomboid,4,0.67,False

# Abilities:



|Name|Type|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Air Constructs (Solidification)|Domain|The ability to control air such that it acts like a solid. This power allows the creation of constructs and platforms for combat and practical use such as walking. |
|Anemoi Temperature Resistance|Domain|A trait where some children of the Anemoi are well-adapted to the domains of their parents. Children of Eurus are comfortable with both temperature extremes‚Äîbut have developed immunities to common allergens such as pollen. |
|Leaf Storm|Major|he ability to manipulate the elements to such a degree that the user has created a storm of leaves. Any creature within this zone will be pelted by rapidly moving foliage and subjected to a seemingly endless array of paper cuts.  This area has a radius of 15 feet (4.6 meters) and lasts for 5 turns (30 minutes), unless the claim has been revoked. Users need 1 turn (or 6 minutes) to channel their energy. Intermediate users are known to double their range. |
|Shockwave Generation|Minor|The ability to generate a small shockwave around the user. This shockwave often manifests as a cry so loud, those within the area of effect are knocked back, up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) away. This power has commonly been observed to trigger when a demigod endures their first injury in a battle.|
|Wave Manipulation (Wafiakinesis)|Minor|The ability to create waves of various elements up to 10 feet tall. Beginner users are capable of affecting two of the following elements: water, earth, or air. Intermediate users then train to affect all three. A demigod anthropologist once noted that crowds tend to do ""the wave"" more often when a demigod with this power is among them.|
|Mushroom Manipulation (Mycokinesis)|Minor|The ability to control mushrooms and similar fungi. Users are known to have fungi move according to their will. Some demigod mycologists commission demigods with this power to help cultivate their yeast and mold colonies. Observers have reported that mushrooms that have been grown exponentially with this power are pretty effective cushioning.|

1hhze6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1hhze6u/coffee_shop_campaign_help/,Coffee shop campaign help,"Hey everyone ‚úåÔ∏è

I‚Äôm working on a project for a coffee brand that‚Äôs deeply rooted in heritage, and I‚Äôd love your creative input to design a series of teaser posts (2‚Äì3) and a revealer campaign to build excitement before the shop officially launches.

The brand is filled with cultural stories, and we wish to showcase those in a way that elicits curiosity, feels genuine, and creates a memorable experience.

Here's what makes this brand special:

 The Branding & Aesthetic

*   **Cultural Inspiration:** The brand has a deep draw from Yemeni heritage. Yemen is thought to be the origin of coffee, and the brand celebrates that legacy through storytelling elements tied directly to that history.
*   **Royal Motif:** In addition, the branding is supported by the idea of a Yemeni queen from ancient history, which reflects notions of beauty, power, and culture.
*   **Design Style:** It will maintain earthy tones like brown and beige, along with minimum illustrations and patterns based on Yemeni landmarks, cultural motifs, and old South Arabian letters or ancient scripts.
*   **In-Store Design:** The shop incorporates these old scripts and architectural elements in a stone-like, textured style, reminiscent of the iconic stone and mudbrick buildings found in Yemen‚Äôs ancient cities.

### What We‚Äôre Trying to Do

We‚Äôre planning a teaser campaign (2‚Äì3 posts) to spark curiosity and get people talking about the brand before revealing the full identity and concept. After the teasers, we‚Äôll move into a revealer campaign that showcases the shop in all its glory.

The challenge is to design campaigns that:

1.  Stay true to the brand‚Äôs rich cultural and historical roots.
2. Create an interesting, modernized highlighting of Yemen as the birthplace of coffee.
3. Be mysterious and captivating without losing the modern audience's touch.
4. Represent the uniqueness of the shop's heritage and storytelling with graphics.
  

### What I Need Help With

I need some fresh creative ideas from this community regarding

	1.	Teaser Campaign: What are some clever ways to use old South Arabian letters, architectural motifs, or other heritage-driven design elements in a series of teaser posts? How can we make these teasers feel intriguing and visually striking while tying them to the coffee and cultural narrative?
	2.	Transition to the Revealer: How can we structure the final teaser(s) to build anticipation for the reveal, tying it all together for maximum impact?
	3.	Revealer Campaign: What would be a strong way to launch the shop‚Äôs identity while celebrating its heritage in a way that feels modern, exciting, and shareable?

Why I‚Äôm Asking

I want to ensure the campaign feels unique and thoughtful, and not too predictable or overddone. Whether it‚Äôs a fresh way to use typography, creative visuals, storytelling techniques, or ideas for audience engagement, I‚Äôd love to hear ur suggestions.

If you need more details about the brand or more specific context, plz DM me! I‚Äôm so down to elaborate privately.

I shared the message with my girl best friend, and since we live in the university dorms, I made sure to lock the door. Ten minutes later, he knocks, so I get dressed and let him in. I was really confused and laughing at the situation. I asked him what was going on, and he said he was visiting friends in the dorm and couldn‚Äôt stand that the girl he loved was so close. We talked, and I made sure to set clear boundaries‚Äîno touching. It was nice catching up, and I did miss him deep down.

After about an hour, he asked if he could stay over. I told him, ""If you stay, we‚Äôre going to have sex. We don‚Äôt trust each other."" He said it was time to go and asked me if I wanted him to stay or leave. I told him it was up to him. He decided to leave, but then I teased him and asked, ‚ÄúDo you want to have sex?‚Äù He looked confused but answered ""Yeah"" and jumped back into bed. I pulled away, saying I couldn‚Äôt do it because I knew I‚Äôd regret it and it would ruin the progress I had made. He stayed in bed and started playing with my hair, and I started touching his arms, telling him he'd been working out a lot. Slowly, he started kissing my neck, and I enjoyed it.

Eventually, I came to my senses and pulled back, saying we couldn‚Äôt do this. He ignored me and went down on me. I couldn‚Äôt resist; it had been a while, and I gave in. Afterward, he asked me, ""Do you want it?"" and I said, ""Yeah,"" before he penetrated me. Suddenly, I realized how wrong everything felt and pulled away, sobbing. I told him, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want it.‚Äù He was confused, begging me to stop crying, but I told him to leave, so he did.

The next morning, someone knocked on my door, and there was breakfast and coffee left outside with no note. I asked my best friend to come over to talk about what happened, and we decided to leave the dorm to get some fresh air. On our way out, he saw us and came running after us, apologizing, saying, ""I‚Äôm so sorry for what happened yesterday. It wasn‚Äôt my intention, and I‚Äôm killing myself for it."" I told him to leave.

I‚Äôm so confused and need some advice on what to do or how to process all this. Can someone help?",1,1734632547.0,rapecounseling,1,1.0,False

Then publicly posting to Facebook about my childhood, because I‚Äôm ready to get it all out and move forward. When it comes to my childhood I have always been told it‚Äôs not that bad.","Post from FB: 

From a very early age I don‚Äôt remember being around my parents much, I remember being with my grandmother and great grandmother. Being on their farm doing water colors. The memories with my parents are different though. One of my first memories is waking up one morning and wandering outside while my mom slept in. I remember trying to get back in but I couldn‚Äôt turn the handle so I adventured around the apartment complex until a neighbor helped me out. Another time I remember is my mom crying her eyes out after fighting with my dad. I offered her some of my sippy cup to make her feel better she declined. 

As I got a bit older we moved to another house, here things became worse and instead of a home it felt more like hell. I watched my parents become addicted to drugs. The fighting got worse. I remember bruises shaped like soda cans on my mother‚Äôs back from being pushed down onto a coffee table. There were other times I saw physicality, and I can still hear them screaming at each other like it‚Äôs seared into my brain. 

There were points where our pets would be put out and neglected, I remember seeing my puppy scrappy go from healthy to nothing but ribs. As a child I wish I could have done more to take care of them but as I said, I was a child. 

I watched my mother cheat on my father multiple times. She even took me with her to see one of her friends. A child should not be asked to keep such dirty secrets. One time my father went to catch my mother in the act and brought me along. This turned into a high speed chase on the highway, me in the passenger seat, scared looking at a speedometer that was reaching 100 mph.

My brother was born in 2001, I removed times where he was left alone with me. I remember times when I couldn‚Äôt get him to stop crying, I‚Äôm not sure where my parents were or what they were doing. But I do know I was child left with baby at times.

While we are on the topic of my brother, I‚Äôve watched and listened to my father claim he wasn‚Äôt his. He would say it loudly and in front of my brother. How can you choose to stay and be somebody‚Äôs father while simultaneously saying he‚Äôs not yours. I don‚Äôt know how hurtful that must feel to hear that but Caleb I‚Äôm sorry you ever had to hear that. You shouldn‚Äôt have.

After my sister was born they got away from the hard stuff‚Ä¶

I remember wanting to do extra curricular things in high school but was always afraid it would inconvenience my parents so I never tried. Besides I knew they wanted to hit the bar every weekend and I had to be home to take care of my siblings. 

Over the years I have tried to rebuild my relationship with my parents. I try to tell them I love them every chance I get and I even went to work with my father. As I worked with him I began to notice that even when I did quality work he would constantly find things to criticize about me. So eventually I left. 

After about a year and half my father offered to be partners with him in business. This seemed like a good opportunity to make more money and provide for my family. But was then talked to and treated the same way. Sometimes it‚Äôs just the tone in with something is said.

I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I have drawn boundaries for people so I can live my life the way I want. And have a future for my child that I didn‚Äôt have. If you are unable to change and respect those boundaries then it shows me how much you cared in the first place. 

You can piss on someone‚Äôs cheerios then try to add sugar to make it better. But you still cant remove the piss.

If there are people in your lives that refuse to hear your story, try to tell you it was better than you remember. They are gaslighting you. There is a reason you feel the way you do, and that should be validated not invalidated.",1,1734632540.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I will say that most of the interviews I got came this month. And most are hiring for January. However, all the interviews I did were from referrals. I don‚Äôt know what that says about the state of the economy, but I must have sent out over 100 resumes for tech related jobs, and I only got 9 interviews that whole time. Each one was a referral.

I don‚Äôt know if I was beating any ATS software, but I had my resume looked at by multiple recruiters and they say mine is fine. I can assume not a single human looked at my resume based on the numerous rejections I got. 

Anyways, I was desperate. It‚Äôs not the best job but I‚Äôm thankful to have a job all things considered. So here‚Äôs some tips for anyone struggling right now:

1) Network. Reach out to your network if you haven‚Äôt yet. Don‚Äôt be afraid to be vulnerable because you never know who might be willing to help you out. Even if it‚Äôs someone who you haven‚Äôt talked to in years. And if you don‚Äôt have that network, cold message people on LinkedIn and start building your network with coffee chats. 

2) Reach out to contracting companies. Some are sketchy, so do your due diligence and research them. If a recruiter asks you for money, block and delete. None of these contracting companies will ask you for money because the employers already pay them to find talent for them. Reach out to recruiters who work at these companies and stay connected with them. They are trying to fill roles fast, so it‚Äôs easy for them to forget about you, but keep messaging them now and then. Don‚Äôt be afraid of contracting jobs, it‚Äôs a lot easier than it sounds to get set up. You can also try out being a T4 resource, you‚Äôll just get less money. Check out TEKSystems, as an example, but there are many out there.

3) If you‚Äôre a fresh grad, apply to New Grad opportunities. Some will hire even if you‚Äôve been out of school for up to 2 years, but some are strict about still being enrolled. Regardless, shoot your shot and network. All it takes is ONE person to believe in you and give you a shot.

All in all, don‚Äôt give up. Keep trying. Don‚Äôt stop applying until you sign that offer letter. And apply to jobs outside of your industry too.

Goodluck.",5,1734632264.0,torontoJobs,7,1.0,False

I can still recall how shocked I was when the first one happened. Shocked and disgusted, just like everyone else. Never in my life had I seen a photo like that before. I remember seeing it on my phone first thing in the morning. Still curled up under the covers like a little girl. Barely even awake. And then there it was‚Ä¶that dividing line severing the past so definitively from the future. It was everywhere. That photograph.


The head of Jimmy Bozo impaled on a pike.


It didn‚Äôt feel real‚Äîlike there‚Äôs no way this was actually happening. Jimmy Bozo, the second wealthiest person on the whole planet. And he didn‚Äôt have a body anymore! That‚Äôs a heck of a thing to wake up to.


It‚Äôs also a heck of a thing to have to try to explain to a bunch of 13-year-olds. Not even two weeks into the school year yet. I didn‚Äôt know the State Board of Education‚Äôs official line at that point, or what I was even allowed to say about it. But I could tell there was no way we were getting back into the impeccable heroics of Christopher Columbus until I said something.


‚ÄúMs. Jacob!‚Äù ‚ÄúMs. Jacob!‚Äù ‚ÄúMs. Jacob!‚Äù


‚ÄúMs. Jacob, why do you think they did that to Jimmy Bozo?‚Äù


‚ÄúDid ya see the picture, Ms. Jacob?‚Äù


‚ÄúMs. Jacob, why would someone cut off Jimmy Bozo‚Äôs head?‚Äù


‚ÄúDid ya see it, Ms. Jacob, did ya see it?‚Äù


‚ÄúMs. Jacob, why was Jimmy Bozo at Burning Man?‚Äù


Now, I didn‚Äôt know what to say to these kids. I certainly didn‚Äôt know why anyone would do that to Jimmy Bozo, the founder and CEO of Amazin!‚Äîthe largest e-commerce platform in the world and arguably one of the most valuable corporations in the long and harrowing history of valuable corporations. 


With a room full of wide-eyed students staring at me, though, I knew I had to say something.


‚ÄúSometimes scary things happen in the world,‚Äù I told them, ‚Äúand there‚Äôs not always a good reason why.‚Äù


Of course, as we all know, by the end of the week we had more answers than we knew what to do with. And quite a few more questions, too. 


Why had Jimmy Bozo gone to Burning Man? It was assumed for the same reason most billionaires went to Burning Man‚Äîthe drugs‚Ä¶the orgies‚Ä¶the bragging rights‚Ä¶the chance to slum it up with a bunch of radical freaks and free-spirited deviants.


What Mr. Bozo evidently failed to account for, though, was just how radical and deviant some of those free-spirited freaks turned out to be. 


The Pirate Pamphlet, as it came to be known, provided a precise explanation for the gruesome act.


It turned out it was no coincidence this had all happened on Labor Day weekend.


It was right there on the cover. That crude sketch of a head on a pike beneath the bold declaration: WORKERS OF THE WORLD, REVENGE! What really drove it home, though, was the list of transgressions it claimed had been perpetrated on the workers of Amazin! by the one and only Mr. Jimmy Bozo. 


None of the claims were too controversial, or really even disputed. We‚Äôd all been hearing about these standard practices for years. The low wages and long hours. The union busting. The horrible working conditions and egregious jobsite safety concerns. 


It was the type of corporate exploitation that should have had us folks up in arms long ago.


But life is hard, and it‚Äôs busy and messy and so often so tiring. And there are only so many times you can read about delivery drivers having to pee in bottles or warehouse workers passing out from heat exhaustion before the words start losing all meaning in that stressed-out, beaten-down head of yours, especially when the prices Amazin! was offering were so low and the delivery times so quick.


The Pirate Pamphlet got its nickname from the skull and crossbones printed on the back, above the Latin phrase: MEMENTO MORI. 


Some saw it as a reminder. Others a warning. And still others a threat.


Remember that you will die.


For the people at Burning Man, though, during the first few days that those pamphlets were getting passed around they apparently saw it as a joke. It was right in line with the anticapitalistic spirit of the event. And when they eventually found Jimmy Bozo‚Äôs head on that pike out there in the middle of the desert that‚Äôs what they thought it was too‚Äîa joke. It took a while for those drugged-up folks to realize what they were laughing at wasn‚Äôt some gory art-installation‚Ä¶it was a crime scene.


But who had done it?


How had they done it?


And what in God‚Äôs name did this mean for the world going forward?


These were the types of questions we were left with‚Äîand are still, in a sense, struggling with to this day.


***


The next one was just as big of a shock. To be sure, in no way was I expecting the untimely decapitation of Jimmy Bozo. But even after it happened, I certainly never expected to see that type of thing happen again. 


Unfortunately, I was one of the 16 million Americans who happened to be watching the game that fateful October night. The Kansas City Chiefs vs. the Colorado Broncos at Mile High Stadium. Week 6‚Äîtheir first meeting of the year‚Ä¶set to play out under the bright lights on Monday Night Football!


My father, you see, is a diehard Chiefs fan. The old man hasn‚Äôt missed a game since he swore off church back when I was in high school. And recently watching Chiefs‚Äô games together had become a way for my family to try to reclaim a sense of normalcy in what for us had already been a pretty screwed up world for quite some time.


This particular Monday night was no different. I was sitting on the couch, sandwiched between my young niece and nephew, my father hunched forward in what had become his usual chair, my mother sitting on the arm of the chair, my brother-in-law off preparing something in the kitchen‚Äîall of us doing our best to ignore my big sister‚Äôs conspicuous absence. 


I watched as the Chiefs intercepted the ball on their own 15 yard line with 5:17 left in the game, down by 3. I was on the edge of my seat as they made that drive down the field, 78 yards in under three minutes. I was holding my breath on third and goal as that pass went up, and you better believe I didn‚Äôt breathe again until the ball was pulled in for a completion at the back of the end zone. 


‚ÄúTouchdown!‚Äù


I was looking right at the TV, focused intently on one replay angle after another, everyone else in the room going wild all around me, only 1:23 left in the game, up by 3, when they cut to the owner‚Äôs box for a customary shot of the bigwigs celebrating.


I heard one of the announcers laughing: ‚ÄúOh, looks like someone‚Äôs ready for Halloween early this year.‚Äù Then the other announcer distinctly not laughing: ‚ÄúWait, what‚Ä¶.‚Äù Then straight to commercial.


It was only a few seconds. But in that brief time I was able to see what the announcer was referring to‚Äîa couple of ghoulish figures sitting side by side in the seats at the front of that luxury box, their severed heads propped up on the ledge in front of them. It looked like any number of the decorated porches that would be going up throughout the country in the coming weeks. 


Of course, as we all learned the next day, those two decapitated figures had very recently been a pair of living, breathing human beings.


The white-haired one on the left was Robert Wanton, the eldest scion of the wealthiest family in the world, himself the seventh wealthiest person in the country and one of the new co-owners of the Colorado Broncos. The gray-haired one on the right was Wanton‚Äôs son-in-law, Craig Peener, fellow Bronco‚Äôs co-owner and the chairman of Want-Mart‚Äîthe biggest retailer in the world and the largest private-sector employer in the country. It was a position Peener had recently taken over from his father-in-law, who himself had taken over from his own father, Sam Wanton, some two decades before. Now, ol‚Äô Sammy had founded Want-Mart back in the ‚Äô60s and was known for his cutthroat business practices and the personal motto: You can‚Äôt have low prices without low wages. That ingenious idea had continued on as a company ethos into the present day, to the point where Want-Mart consistently ranked as one of the top employers of full-time workers qualifying for food stamps and Medicaid. 


All of this, of course, was detailed in the pamphlet the spectators at Mile High Stadium that night found tucked under their windshield wipers as they funneled into the parking lot after the game‚Äîwhat the media took to calling The Queen‚Äôs Screed from the drawing of the Queen of Hearts from Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland printed on its cover. The drawing had been augmented to include a Knave wearing the standard Want-Mart employee vest, his pockets overflowing with tarts, with the Queen pointing at him and delivering her famous line in a dialogue bubble above: ‚ÄúOFF WITH HIS HEAD!‚Äù


Inside the pamphlet was a list of familiar criticisms leveled at Want-Mart, which in addition to poverty wages and ‚Äúwelfare theft‚Äù also included such classics as tax avoidance, wage theft, anti-union activities, predatory pricing, and foreign sweatshops. 


Again, none of it was new information. We‚Äôd been reading about this stuff for decades. But‚Äîjust like with Amazin!‚Äîit sure is hard to get folks to care about this sort of malfeasance when the corporations in question are offering rock-bottom prices, especially when you‚Äôre already pinching pennies just to make ends meet.


I knew a thing or two about this myself. It turns out you‚Äôre not going to make a killing teaching U.S. history to a bunch of eighth graders.


‚ÄúMs. Jacob!‚Äù ‚ÄúMs. Jacob!‚Äù ‚ÄúMs. Jacob!‚Äù


‚ÄúDo you think it was the same people as did it to Jimmy Bozo, Ms. Jacob?‚Äù


‚ÄúDid ya see it on TV, Ms. Jacob, did ya see it?‚Äù


‚ÄúMs. Jacob, do you think they‚Äôre gonna do it again?‚Äù


‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said, knowing officially I wasn‚Äôt allowed to comment on the situation. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know any more about this than you kids do.‚Äù

When the third one happened, I can‚Äôt say I was too surprised. I was still horrified but by that point a lot of us kind of saw it coming. It was the day after Halloween. We Lutherans call it All Saints‚Äô Day, but it seems our neighbors to the south were a little more dead-on with their Dia de los Muertos.


At first nothing seemed too out of the ordinary. Old people die all the time. And no amount of money hoarded up can prevent the inevitable. I found out about it during lunch, sitting in the teachers‚Äô lounge, picking at a cold meatball sub. One article after another popping up as I scrolled on my phone‚Ä¶WARNER BUCKET DIES AT 94‚Ä¶WARNER BUCKET FOUND DEAD IN HIS WICHITA HOME ‚Ä¶WARNER KICKS THE BUCKET.


None of the articles provided much information about the old guy‚Äôs death. They were basically eulogies recounting his major accomplishments.


How he was known as the Wizard of Wichita for his market acumen that had led him to become one of the most successful investors to ever walk the face of the earth. How for over half a century he‚Äôd been Chairman, CEO, and largest shareholder of Jerkshire Fuckaway‚Äîa multinational conglomerate holding company consistently ranking as one of the most valuable companies in the world. How through the years they‚Äôd not only acquired countless businesses, in almost every field imaginable, but also bought up billions of dollars‚Äô worth of shares of some of the most well-known corporations in the world.


It wasn‚Äôt until the next day that we even learned that Warner Bucket, the fifth wealthiest person in the world, had been found with his head lopped off.


And it was still another week before we found out about the pamphlet‚Äîwhat most of us simply referred to as The French One seeing as it was chock-full of references to the French Revolution and was signed by a group calling themselves the Sans-culottes. Their criticism of Bucket and his famous ‚Äúhands off‚Äù approach to ownership wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd ever given much thought to before. But with it spelled out in front of me, I have to admit it was a hard position to argue with. It said it right there on the front of the pamphlet surrounding an image of a bloodied guillotine: It‚Äôs immoral to make money off a business that‚Äôs engaged in immoral business practices. Unlike a head from its body‚Ä¶you CANNOT separate the two.


What really struck me, though, was the pamphlet‚Äôs extensive list of businesses Bucket had apparently been making money off of and all the shady moves those businesses had been making: Moody‚Äôs Investment Services (giving toxic securities top ratings in the lead up to the 2008 financial crisis), Hells Fargo (selling those toxic securities, issuing falsified mortgages, and opening millions of fraudulent accounts for unsuspecting clients), Teva Drugs (price-fixing life-saving medications and lying about the addictiveness of their opioids), Clayton Mobile Homes (using every dirty trick in the book to scam working-class folks out of their meager share of the American Dream), and on and on.


But it was what was written on the back of the pamphlet that made you realize why the authorities were so tight-lipped this time around and why you got the feeling they were trying to sweep this one under the rug. It was a famous phrase pulled straight from the French Revolution: Pla√ßons la Terreur √† l'ordre du jour.


But even more than that, it was the English translation of that phrase found on the walls of Bucket‚Äôs home office in two-foot-tall letters written in the Wizard of Wichita‚Äôs own blood: LET‚ÄôS MAKE TERROR THE ORDER OF THE DAY!


‚ÄúMs. Jacob!‚Äù ‚ÄúMs. Jacob!‚Äù ‚ÄúMs. Jacob!‚Äù


‚ÄúAll I can say,‚Äù I said, trying to recall the mandatory script the State Board had sent out, ‚Äúis that it‚Äôs‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a heinous crime, and I‚Äôm sure the perpetrators will be brought to justice.‚Äù


***


It was The French One that really set it off. It was that invitation to violence that got the ball rolling. Within a week we were off to the races!


Off went the head of the 42nd wealthiest person in the country (founder/president of Menutts Hardware), two days later it was the 133rd (chairman of Chick-Bidet), and the day after that it was the 332nd (longtime CEO of Starbunk Coffee). It turns out unions and living wages weren‚Äôt the worst things that could happen to an employer.


By the end of November we‚Äôd also lost the CEO of McDongle‚Äôs, one of the founders of Home Despot, two board members from Krueger Foods, and the fellow who‚Äôd been running Hells Fargo in its heyday of subprime mortgages and fake accounts. 


It was around that time we also saw the first attempt at the CEO of Midgley Motors, Lonnie Muck, the wealthiest person on God‚Äôs green earth, who had reportedly escaped a kidnapping by the skin of his teeth. ‚ÄúLucky number thirteen!‚Äù as he so tactfully put it. (Although there were some who thought his story didn‚Äôt quite add up.)


With the end of the year approaching, these attacks bulldozed their way through Wall Street, upsetting markets that were already reeling amid the growing fear and widespread panic, as they began targeting some of the top bankers and traders in the country‚Äîthe very geniuses who had tanked the economy in 2008. It spilled over into healthcare and pharmaceuticals, oil companies and the environment. Folks were fed up watching their futures get polluted and plundered. Now, I‚Äôm not saying what these maniacs were doing was right. But at the same time neither was what these captains of industry had been getting away with either.


I was surprised then when some of them were able to see the writing on the wall. Costco, In-N-Out, Trader Joe‚Äôs‚Äîthey all bumped their starting pay up to $25/hour. The former CEO of Whole Foods came out and publicly condemned his decision a few years back to sell his company to Amazin! Heck, the CEO of Cigna just up and quit, apparently hoping it would spare him from any comeuppance he might have coming for him.


Not everyone, though, was quite so willing to acknowledging the error of their ways.


After a second failed attempt at Lonnie Muck (which many, again, were taking with a grain of salt), he started doing the rounds on cable news, spouting off about how important he was to the economy and the hundreds of thousands of jobs he was personally responsible for creating. And after another foiled attempt at him a few weeks later (the details of which were so outrageous they spawned a whole class of memes mocking his uncanny knack for ‚Äúcreative‚Äù escapes), Muck finally showed his hand and announced a ‚Äúretaliatory‚Äù wage-freeze across the board. He wanted it made known he wasn‚Äôt going to let no punks tell him how to run his business, and he was only too eager to institute the punitive measures to prove it.


By then the pamphlets were getting longer and more creative, and were starting to come off more as manifestos or parables. They had titles like Eat the Rich and Reign of Terror and Heads Will Roll! 


Like many others, I initially thought the attacks might all be the work of a coordinated group. But as more evidence trickled in, this seemed increasingly unlikely. Still, there were a few recurring themes I noticed kept popping up. The most popular had to be the danse macabre, with depictions of skulls, skeletons, reapers, etc. The idea, I guess, was that death was coming for these people, and there was no escaping it.


The French Revolution was also a common source to pull from. You had pamphlets signed by the Jacobins‚Ä¶The Jacobin Club‚Ä¶The Mountain‚Ä¶the Montagnards. It was the Cordeliers that got Dick Suckler of Puredoom Pharma‚Äîthe family-owned multibillion-dollar company that had spearheaded the opioid crisis (for which they received a fine, but no jail time). It was The Cordelier Club that got his cousin Cate. And the Club des Cordeliers that got the former-FDA-official/recent-Puredoom-executive many believed had made the whole crisis possible.


The Alice books were another favorite inspiration. It was a pamphlet with the Cheshire Cat on the cover that accompanied the decapitation of Chevrong Oil CEO Mitchell Wirthless, citing the company‚Äôs egregious history of pollution during his 40-year tenure. You had the White Rabbit, the Hatter, the Jabberwocky, even Bill the Lizard. I remember waking up Christmas morning to see that a mock confession signed by the Mock Turtle had accompanied the ‚Äúlong-awaited retirement‚Äù of the now former Senate Majority Leader, with ‚Äúadmissions‚Äù of cronyism, rent-seeking, and personal enrichment on the public dime. And it was only a few days later that The Duchess claimed responsibility for retiring the Speaker of the House on charges of insider trading.


It was an unprecedented display of bipartisanship‚Äîthey were picking them off left and right. U.S. Senators and Representatives, state senators, governors, mayors, even a Justice of the United States Supreme Court. 


Even after months of this chaos and confusion, though, it still didn‚Äôt feel real to me. Not really. It wasn‚Äôt until a couple local fellows went missing. Jack Cordrey, the CEO of Homes4America‚Äîwhich had been buying up single-family houses and turning them into rental properties across the Midwest. And Louis Rottman, our state Governor‚Äîwhose list of accomplishments in office included vetoing a voter-approved bill limiting the number of residential rental properties an owner could operate in the state, hamstringing the ballot-initiative process moving forward, empowering the State Board of Education to standardize public school curriculums to bring them more in line with the ‚ÄúGod-fearing, America-loving ideals this nation was founded on,‚Äù and enacting some of the most innovative and draconian abortion restrictions in the country.


‚ÄúMs. Jacob!‚Äù ‚ÄúMs. Jacob!‚Äù ‚ÄúMs. Jacob!‚Äù


‚ÄúDo you think they‚Äôre gonna cut their heads off, Ms. Jacob?‚Äù


Now, with this one I kind of forgot myself. I said the first six words that came to mind, the six words that would get me put on administrative leave before the end of the week. They just slipped out.


‚ÄúOh, I sure fucking hope so.‚Äù

Una pa hundred, hundred lang ang itinataya nila. Pinag sabihan ko naman siya na itigil niyan na kase baka maadik na siya, pero sabi niya sakin okay lang daw kaya niya icontrol sarili niya. So, naniwala naman ako. Kase di naman talaga siya ganyan dati, tanging kinakaadikan niya lang is to buy local streetwear clothes, shoes etc, wala siyang credit card or loaning app pero meron siyang sloan ang ganda ng credit score niya kay shopee 30k ang meron siya sa sloan dahil na memaintain at nag babayad ng on time. Pero nag bago lahat ng yon nung naintroduce ng kaibigan niya yung sugal. As a girlfriend palagi ko siyang pinagsasabihan na tumigil na siya pero hindi niya man ako pinapakinggan. Hanggang sa dumating na nga yung mga araw na nananalo na siya sa sugal and akala ko minsan lang siya mag online sugal pero litlle did I know kapag nananalo yung friend niya sa sugal at wala siyang pera bibigyan siya ng pang taya ng friend niya para siya din magsugal. May mga times na nililibre niya pako akala ko madami lang siyang kinita sa Maxim (parang grab) bago pa kami kumain umaamin siya syempre wala nakong magawa pagsasabihab ko nanaman siya na tama na kase baka dumating yung time na maski siya di na niya mapigilan sarilj niya. Dumating na yung time na wala siyang kita sa pag mamaxim and nalaman kong yung 30k niya sa sloan inutang niya and don na nag start na magkabaon baon sa utang, I even apply for app loans since I have fulltime work and kaya naman magbayad para lang din mabayaran niya utang niya, pero hirap talaga siya kumita sa maxim and nag suggest ako na what if mag hanap nalang siya ng fulltime work and palagi niya lang sinasabi sakin na nagaaral siya at hindi kaya, isa pa kaya daw niya kumita ng 1k isang araw. Pero sa totoo lang hindi na talaga sapat na 1k lang. Lagi niya rin reason may school and di makapag maxim ng maayos hanggang sa nanalo siya ng 40k sa sugal, yung utang niya sa sloan binayaran niya lahat after non nagyaya siya kumain sa labas, bago payon diko naman alam san yung resto na sinasabi niya so nabadtrip siya sakin at di na kami nag usapa kasama namin pinsan niya pati kapatid niya, nawalan ako ng gana that time kase di na niya ko kinausap the whole time na na nandon kami sa resto after namin kumain umalis na kami para mag coffee pa sana kaso di nako sumama and di nako nag paalam para umuwi dahil nabadtrip na din ako, kinagabihan yung tira niyang 16k pinang sugal niya tapos natalo hindi pa siya nakuntento inutang niya ulit yung sloan niya, ayon doble doble yung utang namin ngayon. kung dati billease at tala lang meron ako, ngayon may apat pakong loaning apps and dahil minsan ako lang gumagastos saming dalawa dahil minsan hindi siya kumakain sakanila, gusto ko maayos at nakakain pa din siya kahit ganto na nangyayare samin. Pero di niya padin maalis sa yung pag susugal. Kinuha ko na yung account niya sa gcash pero need da niya dahil nag papaload sa mxim pero still, nagsusugal pa din siya. Sobrang nakakapagod na palagi nalang ponagsasabihan at sinusulosyunan pero wala naman nangyayare dahil maski siya di niya kayang controlin sarili niya. Nakakapgod nalang kase di niya naiisip na nahihirapan na din ako na palagi ko nalang siyang tinutulungan pero siya hindi niya matuluangan sarili niya. Hanggang ngayon namomroblema ako sa nangyayare, kapag tinitignan ko phone niya palaging may convo with other people na di naman talaga niya nakakausap dati pero kakilala niya tapos mangungutang lang siya. Nakakainis lang din sa part na nagsisinungaling pa siya para makapag sugal. Pano pa pag sumahod siya, ipupunta nalang ba niya lahat sa online sugal?
