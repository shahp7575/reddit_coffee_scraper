1pq7oa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmexPlatinum/comments/1pq7oa3/hotel_bardo_savannah_ga/,"Hotel Bardo - Savannah, GA","Have only seen a year old review for this property, thought I’d share a more up to date experience. Stayed at Hotel Bardo via Amex FHR.

I checked-in around around 2pm with no wait. FHR perks were explained: $150 property credit, $60 breakfast credit, 4pm checkout, free morning coffee and pastries, and we were upgraded to a junior suite.

I noted a special occasion before arrival and shortly after check-in we received a handwritten note from concierge along with a thank you for celebrating there. 

The room design is polished and upscale without feeling stuffy. The shower was great, with good water pressure and very soft towels. Weirdly, I couldn’t find a bath mat in my room so the floor outside the shower got wet. I also found loose hair, definitely not belonging to myself or my girlfriend, on the towels and comforter.   

Dinner at St. Bibiana was excellent. My girlfriend is gluten free and they were very accommodating, including good GF bread service and pasta. Service was amazing, the wine list was solid, and the food was delicious.

The bed was comfortable overall. But the pillows were pretty lacking. 

Breakfast at St. Bibiana was also great, but service was slow. The $60 credit is pretty sufficient for a 2 person breakfast.

Despite having a confirmed 4pm checkout, staff knocked on our door twice in the hour before checkout while the do not disturb sign was up. After the first knock, I called the front desk and they confirmed the late checkout was in their system, but housekeeping knocked again 20 min later to confirm my checkout time.

Here is what I have done:
1. Coffee every morning (with a splash of creamer). Moving to black coffee this week. 
2. I learned pretty early that flour tortillas were not the ones to use. Switched to whole wheat and made enchiladas using turkey, red onions, jalapeno and zucchini for lunch - eat this 4 times a week.
3. Started running and lost about 15 pounds. Run a minimum of 2 miles 2x a week (that's all I have time for). Being a teacher takes up most of my time.
4. Eating smoked salmon (made on my Traegar) once a week with brown rice.
5. No alcohol
6. No regular soda, but coke zero a couple times a week
7. Screwed up several times eating out - ice cream, Arby's a few times since July. Probably more than a few times since July. No more eating a whole box of cookies in 2 days + literally.
8. Stopped eating 6 eggs and 3 tbsp of butter (stirred in the eggs) for breakfast every morning to 6 eggs a week with egg whites to make egg muffins for breakfast. (We have lots of chickens and sell eggs)
9. For pasta, moved to whole grain pasta and made my own pasta sauce. Delicious!
10. Sleeping still sucks. Wake up in the middle of the night and my brain won't shut off. Average about 6 hours or less a Night. Last night for example was 5 hours and 13 minutes according to my ring. Who knows how accurate this is though.
11. Started drinking a lot of water where my body is actually craving it now. Close to 60 oz a day - sometimes more, sometimes a little less.
12. Hoping my liver isn't getting worse and that my cholesterol goes down.

Several of us here are going through this and we're all in this together. We'll make mistakes(I know I'll make more) but one step at a time. I'll post again when I get my liver enzyme results back. Getting blood drawn on Monday and then meeting again on the 29th for analysis with the doctor.

It historically has presented on my forehead on one side of my face the size of a thumb print, and/or on the outer edge of my nose same side. I wrestle for sport, which is how I assume I got it. Never had a cold sore, or anything “down there”

Since my initial OB, flare up’s have for the most part calmed down to roughly twice a year, and hardly noticeable to anyone else. Medicine clears it right up.

My house is very cold, so I did research on a new space heater for cheap. The thing works wonders, I sat in front of it through a snow storm, sleeping, drinking coffee, watching tv. 

So on the first of the month I noticed a brand new rash on the other side of my face. I thought it was staph for about a week, considering that it couldn’t POSSIBLY be herpes, because that’s not where I get herpes. Turns out it was, and I let the infection develop because i am ignorant and didn’t believe it was herpes. 

It was everywhere on the whole side of my head where I sat in front of the infrared space heater. In my ear, my scalp, my beard, my neck, even my chest was itchy on that side.

All things considered, should I jump back on daily suppressive therapy with valacyclovir? It’s it going to behave as if I just got my first infection? will my body figure it out quickly? ",1,1766105997.0,HerpesQuestions,1,1.0,False

1pq7n79,https://i.redd.it/jx1uwo9p728g1.jpeg,2012 La Vieille Cure Fronsac |,"Ah, Fronsac! A right bank appellation that I rarely see reviews of or photos of bottles drank. Looking at the history of the region, it seems recovery from phylloxera was tough - and only in the last few decades has it started to return to some prominence. While I was familiar with the region by name, I had never sampled the wines - and seeing two bottles of this 2012 La Vieille Cure sitting back in one of my less-frequented local shops, purchased one to try (I'm always looking for hideaways like these). Being right bank, it's a blend of mainly Merlot, with a decent chunk of Cabernet Franc and a small percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon (exact blend info was hard to come by) - and a decent vintage for the region. Stored at 55, popped to try a bit, and then decanted over two hours and drank over a further four. Paired with a homemade grilled steak and veggies.

Visually, a deep ruby color, purple hue, strong color to the rim.

On the nose, the first scent upon opening the bottle was strongly Kalamata olives and bell peppers. Very vegetal, very green. I poured it into the decanter for some air and to warm up. After 30 minutes, we started getting the dark fruit - plums, blueberries, blackberries, prunes. Still not very intense, when compared to my most recent Bordeaux - a budget 2016 Cambon la Pelouse (albeit, other side of the river - no comparison to the 2000 L'Arrossee or 2004 Sociando Mallet I’ve had recently too). At an hour, still fruit, some black pepper - and at two hours I got the full experience I was after - tobacco, cigar box, charcoal - still paired with that dark fruit, a hint of coffee. Comparatively though, a less intense nose than I hoped for.

On the palate, the tannins remained strong over the two hours it decanted, and still notable by the last glass at hour six after opening. Lunch at hour two was a great experience - the tobacco leaf and smoke/pepper flavors pairing wonderfully with the steak, and the wine had plenty of decent acidity to cut through the beef. Medium bodied, and even at warmer temps, the 14% never called attention to itself. There's still plenty of time left in this wine. My preference is for Bordeaux around ~20 years of age, and I'm leaning towards going back and grabbing that other bottle to save until 2030 at least to compare notes. The structure is definitely there. Finish is a little middling, but average isn't bad!

At the $40 price point I paid for this, and considering my budget hunts and back-of-shelf searches, I've been able to find better RB/LB Bordeaux with my preferred age - but overall, I'm still pleased with the bottling and with the pairing.",1,1766105938.0,wine,1,1.0,False

I really should despise the thought of you. 

But I just can't. We've blocked each other on everything, as was right to do. But I still occasionally look for you. I guess I do it because I can't help but wonder if you think about me too. If you regret any of it. If you still love me back, or if I'm just another person you burned through. 

So ya, I wish it had been different. As you were fond of saying, my wierd matched yours. I just wish that sentiment had extended to every part of what we were, because damn, we could have been great.

I’m after something real. Shared values, actual trust, long-term goals. Not into games, flings, or modern dating nonsense.

**About Me:** Music’s a big part of my life. I mostly listen to extreme metal, black and death metal stuff. Cradle of Filth is my favorite band, with Belphegor and Burzum right behind. I do vocals for fun and used to play with some guys (I have hit the drum set a couple times). Emperor's song With Strength I Burn probably has my favorite lyrics. You don’t have to love the music, but you’ll need to be okay with the sound, the shirts, and the wall art.

I work in IT, handling help desk support for the rest of the staff, and I’m starting to get into software security. I know tech pretty well but I don’t like to live online. I’ll scroll sometimes, but I’d rather be talking or watching something together than just sitting on our phones.

Been gaming since I was a kid. I’m into Dark Souls, Resident Evil, Timesplitters, and old Tony Hawk. Still down for Kirby or Mario Party with friends. I like board games that actually require some thought, like Betrayal at House on the Hill or HeroQuest. Other stuff I’m into: classic horror, building Gunpla kits, museums, occasional camping, and I’ve been slowly learning Japanese. I don’t drink, smoke, do drugs, or even bother with caffeine usually, not in a judgy way if you drink coffee (but in a judgy way of you smoke).

**What I’m Like:** Introverted at first but social once I’m comfortable. My humor’s usually dry, dark, or a little weird. People say I’m easy to talk to and usually pretty funny in person. I have a strong filter for quality, whether it’s people, ideas, or anything else in life. I don’t fake things and can come off as negative sometimes but that just amplifies the stuff I do like as genuine and not slop. I take relationships seriously. I’m not afraid of commitment, I just want it to be with the right person, someone I can actually build a life with. I’ll take care of the people I love. I’m reliable, loyal, and when I’m with someone, I’m all in.

**What I’m Looking For:** I want a serious relationship with someone who shares traditional values. Long-term, I want a dynamic where I provide and my partner takes care of the home and raises a family. If that sounds boring or outdated to you, we’re probably not a match. I’m looking for someone younger, ideally between 18 and 24, since I want a big family and the timeline matters. I’m most attracted to East Asian or white women with a slim or average build, obviously personality is king but we can’t deny that physical attraction matters. As such I’ve attached pics of me for you to judge.

**Dealbreakers:** tattoos, far-left politics, weed or drug use, heavy drinking, or being chronically online. If you’re into gaming, metal, horror, or nerd stuff, we’ll probably get along. I’m not expecting perfect. Just someone honest, loyal, and serious about building something real. You obviously don’t need to match me 100%, I’m open to trying new things (as long as I’m not doing substances) and hope you’re at least receptive to trying a board game or TCG.

Hi everyone!!

I’m a 33F from Brazil and I work remotely as a digital nomad.
I’ll be moving to Georgia in a few weeks and would really like to start connecting with people before I arrive.

I’m interested in meeting locals and other expats to exchange tips about daily life, neighborhoods, cost of living, culture, and just to make genuine friendships along the way.

I enjoy technology, remote work, learning new languages, exploring cities on foot, and quiet places like cafés and libraries. I’m easygoing, respectful, and genuinely curious about different cultures.

If you’re open to chatting, grabbing a coffee in the future, or sharing advice about living in Georgia, feel free to comment or send a DM.

Hey everyone. I am putting myself out there to meet new people and hopefully build some easy, genuine connections. I am mainly looking for friendship to start. Good conversations, shared interests, someone to laugh with and feel comfortable around. If things naturally grow into something more, I am definitely open to that as well.

A little about me:
I am 33, born and raised in Michigan. I enjoy anything outdoors during the warmer months. Hiking, kayaking, camping, random day trips, bonfires, and pretty much anything that gets me outside. Once winter arrives, I switch into a more relaxed, at home mode. I enjoy reading, watching good shows, drinking coffee, and just enjoying calm nights in with the right person.

Personality wise, I am friendly, laid back, and easy to talk to. Once I am comfortable with someone, I can be silly, sarcastic, and playful. I love to laugh and I enjoy people who do the same. I appreciate genuine and consistent communication without anything forced or awkward. Just two people getting to know each other at their own pace.

What I am hoping to find:
Someone who wants to talk, share stories, joke around, and build something real. Whether it becomes a solid friendship or turns into something deeper, I am open to either. I am not expecting anything instantly. I just want good energy and a natural connection with someone who is also looking for something meaningful.

Stale air escaped my lungs in quick, shuddering bursts. Adrenaline surged through my newly awakened veins, pulsing its manic rhythm into the back of my eyes - the familiar war drums of an approaching panic attack.

Across the room, the door sat quietly in the darkness.

*There was no knock. It was just a dream.*

*Calm down.*

*You need to calm down.*

My ears perked, searching for noise.

Ancient floorboards groaned as they teetered over their termite-stricken support beams.

Wind howled through the valley, causing some loose rain gutters to clink rusty metal against the rafters.

A gag bubbled across the back of my tongue, imagining the filthy, contaminated air pawing at the sides of my house, painting the stone veneer pitch-black with its disease, its pesticides, its toxic emissions and its cancerous oxides.

But that was it.

*See? No more knocks, because no one’s here, because no one can be here. Also, why would anyone even bother breaking in? For your vast riches? For you? Give me a break.*

Still, my buzzing nerves refused to settle.

I swung my jittery, sweat-caked legs over the edge of the mattress, sighed, and raised both hands in front of my chest.

Three quick taps to the right collarbone. Three long taps to the left collarbone. A final three quick ones on the right. Inhale, exhale.

Tap-tap-tap. Tap...tap...tap. Tap-tap-tap. Breathe in, breathe out.

It was the last vestige of therapy I’d managed to hold on to.

Tap-tap-tap. Tap...tap...tap. Tap-tap-tap. Breathe in, breathe out.

Always soothing, always centering. With every repetition, my mind cooled. The pattern never failed to bring me home.

Then, gently, almost lovingly:

**Knock-knock-knock.**

I stared at the door.

**Knock...knock...knock.**

Suffocation seared deep gashes into the base of my throat.

**Knock-knock-knock.**

The latch bolt clicked, and it creaked open.

Not fully.

Only an inch.

I froze. My wild heart thumped, marching along the underside of my sternum, battering its cartilage, threatening to spring from the confines of my rib cage like the jester of a blood-drenched jack-in-the-box.

*The nearest house is ten miles away.*

*None of the alarms went off.*

*Who the fuck is standing out there?*

A series of dull, sluggish thuds emanated from the hallway, quieter and quieter as the seconds crawled on. Not exactly footfalls. The noise was muddy. It lacked discreteness: no separation of one foot from the next. The thuds were more like an overfilled burlap sack being heaved across the floor, items audibly shifting within the coarse fabric with each pull.

My bulging eyes remained fixed on the moon-touched darkness spilling in from the cracked doorway.

I shifted forward. The wood was cold on the balls of my heels, biting at the exposed skin. I stood. A long, shuddering moan exploded from the plank bowing under my weight.

My entire body tensed. Psychic pain ran dizzying laps along the length of my spine, up and down, up and down.

I listened.

I waited.

Silence.

A razor-sharp vacuum of sound.

Then, from a further distance: the knocks. Same pattern. My pattern: tainted, defiled, bastardized.

Then, the thuds resumed.

I bent over, drew an aluminum baseball bat from under my bed, and crept towards the door. Pearly moonlight trickled across the room, filtering through the pines outside my second-story bedroom window, manifesting a dancing panorama of ghostly shapes as the branches wavered in the wind.

I *could* have escaped, right then and there.

I *could* have opened the window, climbed down the tree, and sprinted through the forest in the direction of the nearest highway.

Hell, I *could* have just jumped. The ground wasn’t that far. Good odds I would’ve limped away with a few bumps and bruises, nothing more.

It wasn’t an option.

*I’d rather die than leave this house.*

I flattened myself against the wall and peeked my eyes over the doorframe.

A large, amorphous shadow lingered motionless at the end of the hall. They were wide enough to fill the hallway, but short, barely tall enough to rise above the railing. Jagged edges protruded all along their silhouette: from their thick torso, from their broad shoulders, from their slender, box-shaped head - everywhere. A malformed clump of black fangs on an ominous patrol.

I squinted. Cocked my head side to side.

*What in God’s name are they wearing?*

Halfway between us, a narrow beam of moonlight descended, illuminating a column of dust in its angelic glow. My gaze drifted upwards. I threw my hand over my mouth and wrenched my head from the doorway. A wail churned in my throat. I fought desperately to keep the noise contained.

There was a small, circular hole in my roof.

The perimeter was compromised.

My hand fell from my lips. I grasped my chest, practically clawing at its bones. My lungs became a bonfire.

*I’m already breathing it in. I can feel it sinking into me, chewing on my scars. I’ll be wheezing soon. Then the gnawing breathlessness, and then...*

A phantom sensation took hold of me.

It was the feeling of a tube sliding down my throat, icy plastic compressing my airway, overriding my will, forcing gulps of filthy atmosphere inside of me before promptly sucking it all out, every single scrap of oxygen until my lungs deflated like a balloon.

My fingers, on autopilot, guided solely by muscle memory, rose to tap my collarbone.

They only collided once:

**Knock.**

The sound was impossibly resonant.

I snapped.

I scrambled over to my nightstand, bare feet slamming into the wood. The bat fell from my sweaty hands. The hollow metal collided with my bedframe, and a high-pitched, melodic clamor tore through the room. Coughing, I ripped the drawer off its hinges and sent it crashing to the floor. Pens and hard candies and loose change scattered around me as I dug through its contents, stopping only when I found what I was searching for: a facemask and a roll of heavy-duty tape.

I threw the mask on and stomped into the hallway, my mind a hazy, screaming blur. The ceiling was thankfully low. I lifted myself onto the treacherously slim railing that overlooked my foyer, reborn as a living paradox - driven utterly fearless under the influence of mind-shattering fear.

My trembling hand reached towards the hole in the ceiling. Steam gathered around its perfectly circular, concrete margins, but the air wasn’t hot against my fingertips; it was painfully cold, downright glacial. I tapped a torn edge of tape into the stone.

It was mushy. Gelatinous. A chunk of it was displaced upwards by my meager touch.

Disbelief roared through my body.

The piece of tape didn’t stick. Instead, it fluttered down, swaying delicately, a falling leaf in a bitter November wind. My other hand stretched to catch it.

I slipped.

I could see up through the hole as I fell.

There was an unnaturally bright, yellow-tinged star in the night sky: a shimmering speck of amber bejeweling the firmament.

The back of my head smashed into something hard.

A blip of pain,

then everything turned black.

\- - - - - 

I had the strangest dream.

It’s 2021.

I’m back in New York City, entombed in a sleek, minimalist apartment high above the city streets. I’ve been out of the hospital and off the ventilator for a few months, maybe half a year. I’m staring outside, petrified by the disorder, the raw chaos of it all. My dread calcifies into swathes of tiny, pus-stained crystals, clogging the arteries that feed my heart, causing the vessels to swell painfully in my chest.

I start tapping on my collarbones.

Craig sneaks up behind me.

He startles my frayed nervous system.

I jump, twisting around to face him. My ex-husband is rolling an overstuffed suitcase behind him. Dirt-stained socks and books dog-eared with hundred-dollar bills are leaking from small slits in the front zipper. I’m not sure why I didn’t hear him approach. The wheels of the suitcase rattling against the tile are borderline deafening.

Once again, he chastises me. Says something like:

“If you’re dead-set on living the rest of your life as a fuckin’ germaphobe, the least you could do is keep the apartment clean.”

I correct him, coldly, clinically - the way I wanted to correct him when it really happened.

“I’m not really germaphobic. Broadly speaking, I’m agorophobic. If you want to be more precise, I guess you could label me ‘aerophobic’, though that usually refers more to a fear of flying in a plane, rather than a fear of the air itself...”

He waves a dismissive hand in my general direction and turns to walk away.

Craig doesn’t get very far.

After a few steps, his body melts.

The man completely liquifies into a puddle of molten skin and soggy clothes. No skeleton is left behind. The handle of the suitcase flops onto the human reservoir with a wet smack.

I’m upset, I think. Something close to upset. At the very least, I feel decidedly alone.

But not for long.

The puddle quivers. Convulses like there’s an earthquake in the distance.

The steaming fluid springs to life.

It snaps up, congeals to everything around it, and begins to animate...

\- - - - - 

I jolted upright.

My back muscles lamented the sharp movement, crying out in agony. I winced. My skull throbbed something vicious. Hot, labored breaths pushed against the inside of the facemask.

The coffee table broke my fall.

The house was dark. Every room was quiet.

No thudding,

no tapping,

and no knocking.

I hoisted myself off the fractured glass top and stood. Nagging shards dug playfully into my heels. The pain barely registered.

Was anyone ever really here?

I pivot my aching neck. Judging by the bleary green dot aside the front door, the alarm system was still primed. All five deadbolts remained tightly latched, silver chains curling between the door and its frame, twinkling in the moonlight.

Moonlight...

I swung forward, eyes wide, knees weak, nearly toppling face-first into the shattered remains of my coffee table before catching myself.

And there it was.

A single, quiet beam of moonlight streaming through the enigmatic hole in my ceiling, skewering my perfect bastion like a spear through the gut. My eyes traced its descent. The same beam glittered silently in my first-floor restroom.

Something plummeted through the roof, but, Lord, how far down did it go?

I limped over to the open door and flicked the light switch. The trajectory was clear. Whatever fell, it plunged through the ceiling, through the upstairs floorboards, and finally through the basin of my shower, a few inches from the drain.

Everything around the point of impact had changed.

Or, more accurately, was still changing.

A bevy of white acrylic cysts encircled the small hole. Most were the size of a tennis ball, but the largest among them was nearly the size of a fire hydrant. Engorged and pulsing, a phosphorescent liquid dribbled from the cysts. A smaller one audibly popped as I observed them, releasing the liquid and a smoky, metallic scent into the air, like the aroma of a pork chop if you could grill it with gunpowder.

The hole continuously exuded wisps of steam.

I followed one of those wisps up the shower wall.

Right where the steam appeared to concentrate, a tuft of strawberry blonde hair grew from the tile, attached to the ceramic by what looked like a patch of scalp. Clearly, it was my hair. I'd lose a strand or two when I showered, but never a whole godforsaken tuft.

God, Christ, I need to go.

But where can I go?

I flicked the light switch off.

I’ll just have to hide.

Blackness enveloped me.

Then, to my right:

Knock-knock-knock.

I didn’t turn.

Knock...knock...knock.

I couldn’t bear to look.

Knock-knock-knock.

I just ran.

The foyer passed by in a messy haze. My body howled, each accumulated injury its own voice in the agonizing cacophony. The small of my back spasmed, the muscles kicking like a mule. Hot blood dripped down my pounding head wound. My lungs ignited. Viscous breath like coal smoke sputtered from my cracked lips.

The heaving thuds were only a few steps behind me.

I reached the door and started unlatching the deadbolts.

One. Two. Three.

Thud. Thud. Thud.

Four, and five, and -

Thud.

My hand gripped the knob.

I could open the door.

I hesitated.

God, I hesitated.

Thud. Thud.

The phantom tube began to slither down my throat once more. The icy plastic. The filthy, filthy atmosphere.

TURN.

TWIST YOUR GODDAMNED WRIST.

Thud.

My hand fell from the knob.

I couldn’t bear it.

I just couldn’t bear it.

I turned around, put my back to the door, and slumped to the floor.

It was only a few feet in front of me.

A hallucinatory amalgam of steaming flesh and strawberry blonde hair, ornamented with random pieces of my home. They jutted from its corpulent center with no apparent order or intention. A faucet head from its left flank. Vinyl records fanning from its chest like an exotic bird puffing out its plumage. There was no head on its shoulders; only the narrow apex of an antique clock. As it thudded towards me, the fixture chimed four AM. The sound was muffled and coarse, emanating from within its shuddering hide.

It towered over me. Globs of the phosphorescent liquid drizzled at my feet, like it was slobbering. The amalgam's copious steam distorted the surrounding atmosphere.

I waited.

I braced for the end.

No end came.

It began sliding away from me.

The amalgam heaved forward a few inches, then paused. The faucet head swiveled, then protruded, revealing a length of red, spongy muscle driving the metal. The curve knocked a familiar pattern into a nearby wall.

My pattern.

Then, it started moving again.

It doesn’t want to hurt me...it doesn’t want anything.

It’s aimless. No goal, no purpose, no point.

It’s just wandering.

Spinning its wheels.

Trapped.

The parallel was hard to swallow.

Tears welled. I choked back a few sobs before tearing the mask from my face, launching it across the room. As my hand recoiled, I accidentally smeared a drop of the amalgam’s fluid onto my pinky finger.

The tingling only lasted for a second.

Then, I began changing.

A nub of malignant flesh burst from my pinky finger, shattering its nailbed. An overdue scream finally billowed from my chest.

It was another pinky finger, glistening with blood.

I sprang to my feet and sprinted into the kitchen. I placed my thumb into my palm and they congealed together. Additional fingers exploded circumferentially from my pinky, eviscerating the original digit. They pushed into each other with malignant indifference, growing, expanding, becoming a hellish latticework of oozing stumps. I didn’t bother with the lights, nor a cutting board. The change was spreading. I had no time.

I raised the butcher’s knife.

You can choose to live.

I raised the knife even higher.

Or you can choose to let yourself die.

The blade fell like an avalanche.

Can’t have it both ways.

Clunk-clunk-clunk.

A vortex of electric agony detonated across my wrist.

I screamed.

I screamed again.

There was warmth. Profuse, distressing warmth. Eventually, the static simmered.

When I could manage, I looked down.

It was done, and it seemed to have stopped the spread.

Make a choice.

I wrapped the wound best I could and left the writhing mass of fingers on the countertop.

Then, I sprinted for the door.

I twisted the knob,

took a deep, deep breath,

Yet it is that beautiful pink thay tints your cheek bones and those hands that swiftly cover your features that deter me. I do not want you to hide yourself from your appraisal.

Those black curls that adorn your head remind me of vines. Vines that I'd love to be caught in.   Those dark tendrils of yours feel so light in my hands, that I'm always caught of by your desire to trim them down. 

I will admit, having you slap my hand before I finish running my fingers through those soft locks of yours hurts me deeply. You say I ruin your curl pattern and I apologize. I always do.

You find the darkness of your hair boring. That couldn't be further from the truth. The shade of your inky curls is regal. To me it suits you wonderfully.

Those obsidian ringlets allow me appreciate your coffee colored eyes, and their almond shape. The manner in which it contrasts your skin color adds to your loveliness. In the winter when your tone is lighter those curls make you a princess.

Come summer, you look like a goddess with that caramel tone your skin takes. Though I appreciate fall and spring the most. Your freckles and beauty marks stand out by then. Probably because I'm kissing you. 

Are you growing red again? Sorry. Sorry. Yes those freckles look like someone tapped cocoa powder under your eyes softly. I had always thought you painted them onto your cute face.

Those beauty marks on the other hand. Those are a riot. How do you even get them positioned like that? I'm not laughing my love, I swear I'm not. But how on earth did you position those five beauty marks into a question mark. That's absurd.

I'm not laughing at you my heart, I find that delightful question mark on your left cheek to be endearing and true to your nature. You're always reading and investigating things that interest you.

And I agree with you, Moths have prettier faces than butterflies do, yes Echidnas and hedgehogs are not the same, they just both happen to be spiky. And yes I become putty when you look at me.

Those cupid bow lips are smiling at me aren't they? Yes, they are. I've done a good job today, haven't I, my sweetest?

Perhaps the next list, can start with a kiss? No? No, darling please don't cover your face let me start a different list.",1,1766104694.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

1pq73o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1pq73o4/frosty_the_snowman/,Frosty the Snowman,"My son and I experienced one of his first real snowstorms together earlier this week. Obviously, being from the south, we decided to take advantage of the situation and get as much playtime as possible before the snow inevitably melted away, leaving us with nothing but mud and slush beneath our winter boots.

After a marvelous snowball fight that proved devastating on both fronts, we decided that, yes, it was time to build a snowman.

My son had only ever seen snowmen in books and on television, but now he was finally able to really see one—finally able to feel the magic of watching a winter icon come to life.

We rolled up a huge base, a modest middle, and a surprisingly life-sized head that was just begging to be decorated with a carrot nose and dark coal eyes.

We finished it off with a marshmallow smile and gave him a nice little scarf and coat to “keep him warm,” as my son would say.

Once he was finished, together, my son and I took a few steps back and reveled at the perfect, Hallmark snow-buddy that we had just created.

We stood there for a moment, just in awe. It had been a beautiful memory and a beautiful day with my boy. He looked up at me through his Coke-bottle glasses, and I felt all my problems fade away at the sight of the excitement in his eyes.

The temperature became unbearable, however, and instead of standing around gawking, we decided to head inside for a nice cup of the hot chocolate his mom had been brewing as she watched us play from the kitchen window.

The three of us curled up on the couch and watched Home Alone while a fire roared gently from inside our fireplace.

Sometime later that night, my wife and I sent our son up to bed while the two of us prepared to hit the hay as well.

Stopping by the kitchen for one last cup of my wife’s cocoa, I peered out the window and saw that the snowman was still outside, just as we had left him.

However, I could’ve sworn that it looked as though he had moved toward the house about four or five feet.

I shrugged this off and blamed it on being more than a bit sleepy after my long day in the cold, and my wife pulled me by the hand upstairs, where I collapsed into bed, snoring before my head even hit the pillow.

The next morning, I was awoken by sunlight peeking through my blinds and stabbing at my eyeballs.

I sat up, rubbing my eyes, and was disappointed to hear that the weather called for HEAT that day. That’s right—temperatures in the 70s after a massive snowstorm. Life in the south, huh?

Anyway, it wasn’t too much of a surprise for me, but I knew that my son would be disappointed that our little creation would be leaving us soon.

I could hear my wife downstairs cooking breakfast, and the aroma lifted me out of bed like a cartoon and carried me hypnotically down the stairs.

I greeted my wife with a kiss and a compliment, letting her know just how delicious her breakfast of bacon, eggs, and French toast was smelling. I also may have included a sly comment or two about how good she looked in her purple robe. 

The two of us chatted over coffee, and after a few moments, I realized something.

“Where’s Daniel?” I asked.

“Oh, he’s already outside, playing with that snowman you two made. I think he wanted to enjoy it before the snow melted,” my wife replied lovingly.

Looking out the window once more, I saw my son climbing all over the snowman, treating it like an obstacle course rather than… well… what it was.

I chuckled to myself and thought, kids will be kids, before scarfing down some French toast and preparing to leave for work.

Pulling out of the driveway, I waved goodbye to my wife and told Daniel to have fun with his friend as I began rolling out of my neighborhood.

I had only been at work for about three hours when my phone began exploding with calls from my wife. She sounded frantic and on the verge of tears when I answered.

“DANIEL’S GONE?” she shouted.

Confused, all I could think to say was, “What? What do you mean ‘Daniel’s gone’? Where has he gone to?”

My wife wailed, causing me to jump and move the phone from my ear.

“HE’S GONE, DONAVIN! I WENT OUTSIDE TO CHECK ON HIM A WHILE AFTER YOU LEFT AND HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN! THE NEIGHBORS ARE ALREADY HELPING ME LOOK FOR HIM!”

This kicked me into high gear.

“Wait right there. I’m on my way right now. I’ll be there soon, honey. I promise.”

As I drove back home, a deep pit opened up in my stomach, and it felt like my insides were being tied into knots. Gosh, how I hoped we would find him.

Arriving in my neighborhood, I found that there were already three or four police cars, as well as a fire truck and an ambulance, all parked near my home.

I couldn’t park in my own driveway, so I was forced to walk around fifty feet, where I was greeted by my wife, who looked an absolute mess. Her mascara ran in streaks down her face, and snot and tears dripped off of her in long, unsettling strings.

She collapsed into my arms, and at that moment, my own dam broke. I became a blubbering mess, hopelessly asking officers if they had seen my son.

They informed me that they had not, but the search went on well into the late hours of the night.

As the sun began to sink, I noticed something that made me pause for a moment.

It was hot enough for me to be sweating—for all of us to be sweating, for that matter.

The snow had turned into that dreaded mush, and the humidity outside was almost unbearable…

Yet…

The snowman remained, looking as chilled as ever as it stood a good five or six feet from where Daniel and I had originally placed him.

I stared at the thing for a while, wondering how it could possibly still be standing.

My thoughts were interrupted by my wife, however, who approached me exhaustedly.

Her eyes drooped low, and it was clear that the day had taken a lot out of her.

“They still haven’t found him,” she pouted. “It’s getting dark, and our boy still isn’t home.”

“I know, sweetie. Just have faith. We’ll find him. I promise.”

I sent my wife to bed after that. She objected, of course, but I assured her I’d stay outside and search.

She begrudgingly walked inside and to our bedroom, where she collapsed onto the bed.

I stayed outside, like I promised.

The air had begun to grow chilly again, so I went inside for a brief moment to grab a jacket.

When I returned, that damn snowman had moved yet again—at least a foot or so this time. I was baffled. I had only been gone for no more than two minutes.

I’d had enough and approached the thing, giving it a little shove to try and push it over.

It didn’t budge. The snow didn’t even sink under the weight of my hand. I was absolutely dismayed to find that it had frozen completely solid, even after the heat of the day had melted everything else away.

As I stood in a daze, feet planted in the mud, I heard a noise that shook me from my trance.

From the woods behind my house, I heard the voice of my son screaming for help.

Without a second thought, I dashed toward the tree line, realizing that my boy’s voice seemed to be growing more and more distant.

It led me deep into the woods, and it sounded as though his screams were echoing from all around me, begging his dad to come save him.

I ran for so long that I lost all sense of direction and found myself hopelessly lost.

My son’s voice disappeared, and I was left spinning in circles, trying to find my bearings.

I started getting dizzy from the disorientation and decided to sit on a fallen tree while I recollected myself.

As I rested, my son’s voice could be heard again.

Only, this didn’t seem like my son’s natural voice. It was too… robotic. He just kept repeating the same thing over and over again.

“Daddy.”
“Daddy.”
“Daddy.”
“Daddy.”

It sounded like it was coming from every direction and made me feel like I was losing my mind. I couldn’t even think straight, and my dizziness had become nauseating.

Before I could keel over and puke, however, another sharp and terrifying sound came from off in the distance behind me.

The distinct and unmistakable sound of my wife screeching in agony.

Pure instinct kicked in, and as if I hadn’t been on the verge of losing my stomach contents a few moments ago, I began bolting in the direction of the screams.

They didn’t move away from me this time. I got closer and closer the farther I ran until, as quickly as they had started, the screams ceased and left only the sound of my boots squelching against the forest floor.

I’m not sure when, but eventually my house came back into view.

I noticed that every light had been turned on, and my front door had been left wide open.

The snowman was no longer visible.

As I reached my front porch, I breathlessly climbed the stairs and ran inside. What I found has forever changed me and left me permanently afraid of winter weather.

Standing directly in front of our roaring fireplace were three snowpeople.

One was draped in my wife’s silk robe.

Another wore my son’s Coke-bottle glasses, which were pressed crudely through its head. 

The final snowman just seemed to stare at me. His marshmallow smile seemed more like a devilish grin, now; and his dark, coal eyes bore into my soul while Home Alone played in the background.

They didn’t move away from me this time. I got closer and closer the farther I ran until, as quickly as they had started, the screams ceased and left only the sound of my boots squelching against the forest floor.

I’m not sure when, but eventually my house came back into view.

I noticed that every light had been turned on, and my front door had been left wide open.

The snowman was no longer visible.

As I reached my front porch, I breathlessly climbed the stairs and ran inside. What I found has forever changed me and left me permanently afraid of winter weather.

Standing directly in front of our roaring fireplace were three snowpeople.

One was draped in my wife’s silk robe.

Another wore my son’s Coke-bottle glasses, which were pressed crudely through its head. 

The final snowman just seemed to stare at me. His marshmallow smile seemed more like a devilish grin, now; and his dark, coal eyes bore into my soul while Home Alone played in the background.

1pq72n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1pq72n9/frosty_the_snowman/,Frosty the Snowman,"My son and I experienced one of his first real snowstorms together earlier this week. Obviously, being from the south, we decided to take advantage of the situation and get as much playtime as possible before the snow inevitably melted away, leaving us with nothing but mud and slush beneath our winter boots.

After a marvelous snowball fight that proved devastating on both fronts, we decided that, yes, it was time to build a snowman.

My son had only ever seen snowmen in books and on television, but now he was finally able to really see one—finally able to feel the magic of watching a winter icon come to life.

We rolled up a huge base, a modest middle, and a surprisingly life-sized head that was just begging to be decorated with a carrot nose and dark coal eyes.

We finished it off with a marshmallow smile and gave him a nice little scarf and coat to “keep him warm,” as my son would say.

Once he was finished, together, my son and I took a few steps back and reveled at the perfect, Hallmark snow-buddy that we had just created.

We stood there for a moment, just in awe. It had been a beautiful memory and a beautiful day with my boy. He looked up at me through his Coke-bottle glasses, and I felt all my problems fade away at the sight of the excitement in his eyes.

The temperature became unbearable, however, and instead of standing around gawking, we decided to head inside for a nice cup of the hot chocolate his mom had been brewing as she watched us play from the kitchen window.

The three of us curled up on the couch and watched Home Alone while a fire roared gently from inside our fireplace.

Sometime later that night, my wife and I sent our son up to bed while the two of us prepared to hit the hay as well.

Stopping by the kitchen for one last cup of my wife’s cocoa, I peered out the window and saw that the snowman was still outside, just as we had left him.

However, I could’ve sworn that it looked as though he had moved toward the house about four or five feet.

I shrugged this off and blamed it on being more than a bit sleepy after my long day in the cold, and my wife pulled me by the hand upstairs, where I collapsed into bed, snoring before my head even hit the pillow.

The next morning, I was awoken by sunlight peeking through my blinds and stabbing at my eyeballs.

I sat up, rubbing my eyes, and was disappointed to hear that the weather called for HEAT that day. That’s right—temperatures in the 70s after a massive snowstorm. Life in the south, huh?

Anyway, it wasn’t too much of a surprise for me, but I knew that my son would be disappointed that our little creation would be leaving us soon.

I could hear my wife downstairs cooking breakfast, and the aroma lifted me out of bed like a cartoon and carried me hypnotically down the stairs.

I greeted my wife with a kiss and a compliment, letting her know just how delicious her breakfast of bacon, eggs, and French toast was smelling. I also may have included a sly comment or two about how good she looked in her purple robe. 

The two of us chatted over coffee, and after a few moments, I realized something.

“Where’s Daniel?” I asked.

“Oh, he’s already outside, playing with that snowman you two made. I think he wanted to enjoy it before the snow melted,” my wife replied lovingly.

Looking out the window once more, I saw my son climbing all over the snowman, treating it like an obstacle course rather than… well… what it was.

I chuckled to myself and thought, kids will be kids, before scarfing down some French toast and preparing to leave for work.

Pulling out of the driveway, I waved goodbye to my wife and told Daniel to have fun with his friend as I began rolling out of my neighborhood.

I had only been at work for about three hours when my phone began exploding with calls from my wife. She sounded frantic and on the verge of tears when I answered.

“DANIEL’S GONE?” she shouted.

Confused, all I could think to say was, “What? What do you mean ‘Daniel’s gone’? Where has he gone to?”

My wife wailed, causing me to jump and move the phone from my ear.

“HE’S GONE, DONAVIN! I WENT OUTSIDE TO CHECK ON HIM A WHILE AFTER YOU LEFT AND HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN! THE NEIGHBORS ARE ALREADY HELPING ME LOOK FOR HIM!”

This kicked me into high gear.

“Wait right there. I’m on my way right now. I’ll be there soon, honey. I promise.”

As I drove back home, a deep pit opened up in my stomach, and it felt like my insides were being tied into knots. Gosh, how I hoped we would find him.

Arriving in my neighborhood, I found that there were already three or four police cars, as well as a fire truck and an ambulance, all parked near my home.

I couldn’t park in my own driveway, so I was forced to walk around fifty feet, where I was greeted by my wife, who looked an absolute mess. Her mascara ran in streaks down her face, and snot and tears dripped off of her in long, unsettling strings.

She collapsed into my arms, and at that moment, my own dam broke. I became a blubbering mess, hopelessly asking officers if they had seen my son.

They informed me that they had not, but the search went on well into the late hours of the night.

As the sun began to sink, I noticed something that made me pause for a moment.

It was hot enough for me to be sweating—for all of us to be sweating, for that matter.

The snow had turned into that dreaded mush, and the humidity outside was almost unbearable…

Yet…

The snowman remained, looking as chilled as ever as it stood a good five or six feet from where Daniel and I had originally placed him.

I stared at the thing for a while, wondering how it could possibly still be standing.

My thoughts were interrupted by my wife, however, who approached me exhaustedly.

Her eyes drooped low, and it was clear that the day had taken a lot out of her.

“They still haven’t found him,” she pouted. “It’s getting dark, and our boy still isn’t home.”

“I know, sweetie. Just have faith. We’ll find him. I promise.”

I sent my wife to bed after that. She objected, of course, but I assured her I’d stay outside and search.

She begrudgingly walked inside and to our bedroom, where she collapsed onto the bed.

I stayed outside, like I promised.

The air had begun to grow chilly again, so I went inside for a brief moment to grab a jacket.

When I returned, that damn snowman had moved yet again—at least a foot or so this time. I was baffled. I had only been gone for no more than two minutes.

I’d had enough and approached the thing, giving it a little shove to try and push it over.

It didn’t budge. The snow didn’t even sink under the weight of my hand. I was absolutely dismayed to find that it had frozen completely solid, even after the heat of the day had melted everything else away.

As I stood in a daze, feet planted in the mud, I heard a noise that shook me from my trance.

From the woods behind my house, I heard the voice of my son screaming for help.

Without a second thought, I dashed toward the tree line, realizing that my boy’s voice seemed to be growing more and more distant.

It led me deep into the woods, and it sounded as though his screams were echoing from all around me, begging his dad to come save him.

I ran for so long that I lost all sense of direction and found myself hopelessly lost.

My son’s voice disappeared, and I was left spinning in circles, trying to find my bearings.

I started getting dizzy from the disorientation and decided to sit on a fallen tree while I recollected myself.

As I rested, my son’s voice could be heard again.

Only, this didn’t seem like my son’s natural voice. It was too… robotic. He just kept repeating the same thing over and over again.

“Daddy.”
“Daddy.”
“Daddy.”
“Daddy.”

It sounded like it was coming from every direction and made me feel like I was losing my mind. I couldn’t even think straight, and my dizziness had become nauseating.

Before I could keel over and puke, however, another sharp and terrifying sound came from off in the distance behind me.

The distinct and unmistakable sound of my wife screeching in agony.

Pure instinct kicked in, and as if I hadn’t been on the verge of losing my stomach contents a few moments ago, I began bolting in the direction of the screams.

I sat up, rubbing my eyes, and was disappointed to hear that the weather called for HEAT that day. That’s right—temperatures in the 70s after a massive snowstorm. Life in the south, huh?

Anyway, it wasn’t too much of a surprise for me, but I knew that my son would be disappointed that our little creation would be leaving us soon.

I could hear my wife downstairs cooking breakfast, and the aroma lifted me out of bed like a cartoon and carried me hypnotically down the stairs.

I greeted my wife with a kiss and a compliment, letting her know just how delicious her breakfast of bacon, eggs, and French toast was smelling. I also may have included a sly comment or two about how good she looked in her purple robe. 

The two of us chatted over coffee, and after a few moments, I realized something.

“Where’s Daniel?” I asked.

“Oh, he’s already outside, playing with that snowman you two made. I think he wanted to enjoy it before the snow melted,” my wife replied lovingly.

Looking out the window once more, I saw my son climbing all over the snowman, treating it like an obstacle course rather than… well… what it was.

I chuckled to myself and thought, kids will be kids, before scarfing down some French toast and preparing to leave for work.

Pulling out of the driveway, I waved goodbye to my wife and told Daniel to have fun with his friend as I began rolling out of my neighborhood.

I had only been at work for about three hours when my phone began exploding with calls from my wife. She sounded frantic and on the verge of tears when I answered.

“DANIEL’S GONE?” she shouted.

Confused, all I could think to say was, “What? What do you mean ‘Daniel’s gone’? Where has he gone to?”

My wife wailed, causing me to jump and move the phone from my ear.

“HE’S GONE, DONAVIN! I WENT OUTSIDE TO CHECK ON HIM A WHILE AFTER YOU LEFT AND HE WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN! THE NEIGHBORS ARE ALREADY HELPING ME LOOK FOR HIM!”

This kicked me into high gear.

“Wait right there. I’m on my way right now. I’ll be there soon, honey. I promise.”

As I drove back home, a deep pit opened up in my stomach, and it felt like my insides were being tied into knots. Gosh, how I hoped we would find him.

Arriving in my neighborhood, I found that there were already three or four police cars, as well as a fire truck and an ambulance, all parked near my home.

I couldn’t park in my own driveway, so I was forced to walk around fifty feet, where I was greeted by my wife, who looked an absolute mess. Her mascara ran in streaks down her face, and snot and tears dripped off of her in long, unsettling strings.

She collapsed into my arms, and at that moment, my own dam broke. I became a blubbering mess, hopelessly asking officers if they had seen my son.

They informed me that they had not, but the search went on well into the late hours of the night.

As the sun began to sink, I noticed something that made me pause for a moment.

It was hot enough for me to be sweating—for all of us to be sweating, for that matter.

The snow had turned into that dreaded mush, and the humidity outside was almost unbearable…

Yet…

The snowman remained, looking as chilled as ever as it stood a good five or six feet from where Daniel and I had originally placed him.

I stared at the thing for a while, wondering how it could possibly still be standing.

My thoughts were interrupted by my wife, however, who approached me exhaustedly.

Her eyes drooped low, and it was clear that the day had taken a lot out of her.

“They still haven’t found him,” she pouted. “It’s getting dark, and our boy still isn’t home.”

“I know, sweetie. Just have faith. We’ll find him. I promise.”

I sent my wife to bed after that. She objected, of course, but I assured her I’d stay outside and search.

She begrudgingly walked inside and to our bedroom, where she collapsed onto the bed.

I stayed outside, like I promised.

The air had begun to grow chilly again, so I went inside for a brief moment to grab a jacket.

When I returned, that damn snowman had moved yet again—at least a foot or so this time. I was baffled. I had only been gone for no more than two minutes.

I’d had enough and approached the thing, giving it a little shove to try and push it over.

It didn’t budge. The snow didn’t even sink under the weight of my hand. I was absolutely dismayed to find that it had frozen completely solid, even after the heat of the day had melted everything else away.

As I stood in a daze, feet planted in the mud, I heard a noise that shook me from my trance.

From the woods behind my house, I heard the voice of my son screaming for help.

Without a second thought, I dashed toward the tree line, realizing that my boy’s voice seemed to be growing more and more distant.

It led me deep into the woods, and it sounded as though his screams were echoing from all around me, begging his dad to come save him.

I ran for so long that I lost all sense of direction and found myself hopelessly lost.

My son’s voice disappeared, and I was left spinning in circles, trying to find my bearings.

I started getting dizzy from the disorientation and decided to sit on a fallen tree while I recollected myself.

As I rested, my son’s voice could be heard again.

Only, this didn’t seem like my son’s natural voice. It was too… robotic. He just kept repeating the same thing over and over again.

“Daddy.”
“Daddy.”
“Daddy.”
“Daddy.”

It sounded like it was coming from every direction and made me feel like I was losing my mind. I couldn’t even think straight, and my dizziness had become nauseating.

Before I could keel over and puke, however, another sharp and terrifying sound came from off in the distance behind me.

The distinct and unmistakable sound of my wife screeching in agony.

Pure instinct kicked in, and as if I hadn’t been on the verge of losing my stomach contents a few moments ago, I began bolting in the direction of the screams.

They didn’t move away from me this time. I got closer and closer the farther I ran until, as quickly as they had started, the screams ceased and left only the sound of my boots squelching against the forest floor.

I’m not sure when, but eventually my house came back into view.

I noticed that every light had been turned on, and my front door had been left wide open.

The snowman was no longer visible.

As I reached my front porch, I breathlessly climbed the stairs and ran inside. What I found has forever changed me and left me permanently afraid of winter weather.

Standing directly in front of our roaring fireplace were three snowpeople.

One was draped in my wife’s silk robe.

Another wore my son’s Coke-bottle glasses, which were pressed crudely through its head. 

The final snowman just seemed to stare at me. His marshmallow smile seemed more like a devilish grin, now; and his dark, coal eyes bore into my soul while Home Alone played in the background.

1pq71mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pq71mj/frosty_the_snowman/,Frosty the Snowman,"My son and I experienced one of his first real snowstorms together earlier this week. Obviously, being from the south, we decided to take advantage of the situation and get as much playtime as possible before the snow inevitably melted away, leaving us with nothing but mud and slush beneath our winter boots.

After a marvelous snowball fight that proved devastating on both fronts, we decided that, yes, it was time to build a snowman.

My son had only ever seen snowmen in books and on television, but now he was finally able to really see one—finally able to feel the magic of watching a winter icon come to life.

We rolled up a huge base, a modest middle, and a surprisingly life-sized head that was just begging to be decorated with a carrot nose and dark coal eyes.

We finished it off with a marshmallow smile and gave him a nice little scarf and coat to “keep him warm,” as my son would say.

Once he was finished, together, my son and I took a few steps back and reveled at the perfect, Hallmark snow-buddy that we had just created.

We stood there for a moment, just in awe. It had been a beautiful memory and a beautiful day with my boy. He looked up at me through his Coke-bottle glasses, and I felt all my problems fade away at the sight of the excitement in his eyes.

The temperature became unbearable, however, and instead of standing around gawking, we decided to head inside for a nice cup of the hot chocolate his mom had been brewing as she watched us play from the kitchen window.

The three of us curled up on the couch and watched Home Alone while a fire roared gently from inside our fireplace.

Sometime later that night, my wife and I sent our son up to bed while the two of us prepared to hit the hay as well.

Stopping by the kitchen for one last cup of my wife’s cocoa, I peered out the window and saw that the snowman was still outside, just as we had left him.

However, I could’ve sworn that it looked as though he had moved toward the house about four or five feet.

I shrugged this off and blamed it on being more than a bit sleepy after my long day in the cold, and my wife pulled me by the hand upstairs, where I collapsed into bed, snoring before my head even hit the pillow.

The next morning, I was awoken by sunlight peeking through my blinds and stabbing at my eyeballs.

1pq71kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pq71kr/scarlet_stairs/,Scarlet Stairs,"My father and I were sitting on the porch in the late summer. The Florida heat lingered in the air as the sky burned pink and orange. The woods across the property buzzed with insects, and the humidity made the windows sweat with moisture. Dad sat in his chair with a half-burned cigarette at the corner of his mouth. It was our daily ritual.



He worked a lot, always had my entire life, so these porch talks were something I cherished. We could spend hours out there, discussing anything: history, politics, religion, values, women problems. He always comes off harsh, but he is the kind of man you can talk to about anything. As the sun sank behind the trees and the air finally began to cool, the conversation drifted, as it often did, to old places we’d lived.



There were many of them. He moved a lot when I was young. Military. Work. A second marriage. I don’t remember most of those places clearly, only fragments. A hallway. A backyard. The way a room felt at night.



When I mentioned the house in Pocatello, he went quiet in a way that immediately told me I’d said something wrong. His eyes narrowed slightly as he took a drag from his cigarette.



“I didn’t think you remembered that place.” he said.



I told him I did. Not all of it, but enough. I remembered the stairs. I didn’t mean anything by that, it was just the first image that came to mind but his reaction was immediate. He leaned back in his chair and looked out into the yard instead of at me. For a long moment, he didn’t say anything.



“You were very young,” he said finally. “Four. Maybe Five.”



I told him I knew. That didn’t seem to reassure him. He asked what else I remembered, and I found myself hesitating, suddenly unsure how much I was supposed to say. There are things you grow up learning not to bring up, even if no one ever tells you directly. That house was one of them.



“I remember how white it was,” I said. “And the stairs. The red ones. I always thought that was weird.”



I laughed, trying to cut the tension.



That was when he told me it bothered him that I still remembered it at all. He said memory from that early usually doesn’t last unless something anchors it. He didn’t explain what he meant by that. Instead, he said there was something he’d never told me about the day we left. Something he’d kept from me for twenty years, something he’d thought I was too young to carry with me.



He asked if I really wanted to hear it.



That was the first time it occurred to me that whatever had happened in that house hadn’t ended when we left.





We moved into the house in Pocatello when I was still young enough to be excited by the idea of having a real front door. Before that, we’d lived in apartments and manufactured homes. Places that all felt temporary. This house didn’t. It was old and solid, with wide steps and thick walls that smelled faintly of wood and dust. I remember thinking it felt like a place people stayed.



What I remember most clearly is the way it looked when we first arrived. The exterior was painted a bright, almost blinding white, layered thick over old wooden paneling. The stairs leading up to the front door were painted red. Too red, even to a child’s eye. They stood out sharply against the white of the house and the fresh-cut grass, rising to a large black door that always seemed to soak in the daylight.



Something about those stairs made me uneasy, though I didn’t have language for that feeling at the time. I remember pausing on them more than once, looking down at my feet before climbing the rest of the way up. But I was excited too. I had my own room for the first time, and the town itself felt friendly and familiar in a way other places hadn’t. Inside, the house was quiet in a way I wasn’t used to. Sound didn’t travel the same way it had in our previous places. Footsteps seemed softer, voices more distant. The floors were dark, worn wood, and light came through the windows in narrow bands that shifted slowly across the walls as the day went on.



My room was down a hallway that always felt longer at night. It wasn’t large, but it was mine. I spent most of my time there on the floor, surrounded by toys, drawing or building things I never finished. From my window I could see the yard and the garden my father and his wife worked on in the evenings. During the day, it felt safe.



At night, the house felt different. I don’t remember anything specific happening at first. No noises I could point to, no shapes in the dark, but I remember being aware of the space around me in a way I hadn’t been before. Doors seemed farther away. Corners felt deeper. I always asked my father to keep my door open, even though I couldn’t have explained why.



Downstairs, the basement was finished but rarely used. It stayed cool year-round and smelled faintly of concrete and old air. I didn’t spend much time down there, but I remember the light switch at the top of the stairs, and the way the light looked when it was on. Dull and yellow, seeping up through the gaps in the dark floorboards above.



At the time, it didn’t mean anything to me. It was just the way the house was.



The first things that happened weren’t frightening. They were irritating.



My father worked long hours then as he does now. When he came home, he was usually tired, already halfway thinking about the next day. Most nights he stayed up later than the rest of us, sitting at the kitchen table or in the living room with paperwork spread out in front of him, a cup of coffee going cold beside his elbow and a cigarette always between his fingers. The house would be quiet by the time he finally decided to go to bed.



That was when he started noticing the light.



The basement was finished, but it wasn’t a place we used often. It was too cool, too dim, and it never quite felt like part of the rest of the house. The light switch was at the top of the stairs, just inside the doorway. When the light was on, it bled up through the gaps in the dark floorboards above, faint yellow lines stretching across the wood like something trying to surface.



The first time he saw it, he assumed he’d forgotten to turn it off.



He went downstairs, flipped the switch, and stood there for a moment, listening. The basement was quiet. No hum from the light. No sound of anyone moving. Satisfied, he came back upstairs and went to bed.



The next night, it was on again.



He noticed it while locking up the house, the faint glow visible through the floor near the kitchen. He frowned, cursed under his breath, and went back down the stairs. Off again. Another moment of standing still, another quick glance around, then back upstairs.



By the third or fourth time, it had started to irritate him.



He asked his wife if she’d been down there late at night, if she’d left the light on by accident. She said no. He asked me once, casually, if I’d been playing in the basement. I hadn’t. I only ever went down there with one of them. 



It kept happening anyway.



Some nights it would be off. Other nights it would be on again, always late, always after the house had gone quiet. He began checking it automatically before bed, annoyed as he headed for the stairs. Sometimes he’d turn it off and find it on once he reached the main floor. It turned into a small, pointless battle with the house. One that never escalated enough to demand real attention, but never stopped either.



I didn’t know about any of this at the time. Or if I did, it didn’t register. Looking back, I realize it was the first thing that made my father uneasy. Not afraid. Not yet. Just aware.



He didn’t talk about it much. He didn’t pray over it or call anyone about it. He did what he always did when something didn’t make sense. He ignored it and kept working. The light wasn’t hurting anyone. It wasn’t costing him anything but a few extra steps down the stairs.



But it was persistent. 



By the time anything truly frightening happened, the house already felt different. Quieter somehow. The wooden floors felt darker and heavier. As if it had learned our routines and was testing how much we would overlook.



It happened one ordinary afternoon. The sun was high, pouring through my bedroom window. I remember the breeze flowing through the curtains. I was playing with a friend from school. We had spread our craft-store animal toys across the floor. The large rug our ocean for little sharks and whales. Arranging them in patterns and making up grand stories. The air was warm and still, the kind of quiet that makes a house feel like home.



My father’s wife came in to tell us that my friend’s mother was outside, waiting to take him home. We said our goodbyes and I heard them leave, their voices drifting across the yard. I began to gather the toys, putting them into the box I always kept in my closet. I paused to look out the window. My father and stepmother were talking in the garden. They seemed calm, unhurried. I placed the box in the closet and began to rummage through another for more toys.



Then it happened.



I felt it before I even understood it. Two large hands pressed hard against my upper back. The shove sent me stumbling into the closet, the doors slamming shut behind me.



Darkness. Complete. I couldn’t see a thing. I couldn’t even think about what had pushed me. All I felt was a sudden, overwhelming dread and a strange, insistent compulsion not to turn around. I screamed, of course. I cried. I banged against the closet walls, hoping someone would hear me. I remember the air smelled faintly of wood polish and dust. Every sound in the house seemed amplified. It was one of the first times I could hear my heart pounding in my ears.



My father came running. He must have heard my screams from outside. I could hear him pounding on the closet doors, calling my name. He tried to pull the doors open. They didn’t budge at first. Then, he began smashing his heel into them. The doors splintered and he ripped me out. 



Nothing else happened. Just as suddenly as it began, it ended. The closet was empty. I was shaking. My father held me tight. I remember the quiet afterward. The kind that fills a room when everyone has stopped breathing at the same time.



After that, my feelings one the house completely changed.





Pressure began to fill the house. It wasn’t that anything visible had changed. The walls were the same white, the sun still fell through the windows in the same narrow bands. But the air was heavier, colder somehow, and the shadows seemed longer. Hallways felt more confining. My room, once a place of comfort, felt hollow, and the window looking out over the yard no longer reassured me.



None of us wanted to be alone there anymore. I stopped going into the hallways without company. My father spent more time in the workshop or outside, avoiding the house when he could. He wouldn't talk about what had happened. I could tell he didn’t want to acknowledge it. That was his way of keeping it from becoming real.



My stepmother took a different approach. She spent hours in the kitchen with books open, reading about ways to cleanse and protect a home. She tried sage, incense, and prayers. Sometimes she moved through the rooms muttering softly, fumbling with bundles of dried herbs. My father allowed it, though reluctantly, and mostly stayed away while she worked. After that, the house seemed to settle somewhat. It wasn’t the same as before, but the oppressive weight lifted just enough that daily life could continue.



Still, I noticed changes in small ways. Doors that used to swing easily now creaked even when touched lightly. Floors groaned under no weight. Shadows in corners shifted as if avoiding the light. At night, the basement smelled stronger, sharper, colder. The house seemed aware of our movements, and of our reluctance to be alone.



I tried to ignore it, focusing on toys, games, friends, and school. But there was a tension always in the background, a quiet waiting. And I realized, even as a child, that it wasn’t going away entirely.



Months later, I left to visit my mother. When I returned, the feelings I once had, the excitement, pride, and comfort were gone. The scarlet stairs, once vivid and playful in my memory, now seemed like a sprawling tongue of some great monster. Something I had to climb carefully, as if each step required a conscious effort. The hall by my room was darker, longer, and I could feel the house itself pressing around me.



By then, I understood one thing. Whatever had happened in that closet had changed the house, and in some ways, it had changed us too.





It was late, quiet. The kind of night where all outside sounds diminish into eerie stillness. I had been sleeping in my room, the door open as usual, when my father woke to get a glass of water. On his way back, he said, he felt the need to check on me.



When he opened the door, he froze.



According to him I was standing on my bed. My eyes had rolled back, showing only the whites. My arms were extended in a stiff, strange formation. Something like an arrow, my father would later say. I was moving my lips, forming words, but nothing came out that anyone could understand.



He grabbed me immediately. I remember being too frightened to even register the comfort of his hands. He held me tight, commanding, praying to Christ, speaking aloud in a way that made him sound both furious and terrified. His voice boomed through the house and woke my stepmother. 



I don’t remember the words he said. I only remember the sensation. The pressure of his hands, the sound of his voice filling the room. Then, it was over. Just like the closet. I was normal again. The bed, the blankets, the room. Everything was as it had been.



After that night, nothing else happened at that level of intensity. We moved soon after, living with my grandparents for a while until things settled elsewhere.



Even years later, he said he thought I was making the sign of the cross with my body but it had looked more like an arrow, deliberate and odd. For him, it was terrifying. For me, it was confusing. And for both of us, it left a mark on the memory of that house that never faded.





Years later, as we sat together on that porch, in the late summer evening. The Florida heat softening as it faded into evening. We talked about many things, as we always did life, work, small worries but inevitably, the house in Pocatello came up again.



He told me he was surprised I remembered it at all. “I didn’t think any of that would stick,” he said. “You were so young.”



I told him I remembered the scarlet stairs, the hallways, the basement light. He nodded, listening, but his eyes seemed distant, like he was weighing whether he should say more.



Then he paused. Long enough for me to realize that something important was coming.



He told me that the day we finally moved, he and my aunt were outside, packing the last boxes into the moving truck. As they worked, he said, both of them looked up. The sky was dark with clouds and the stairs looked like an open wound. Both of them saw it.



A black silhouette. Watching from my bedroom window.



He hadn’t told me because he decided I was too young to know such things. Too innocent to carry it. He had assumed I would forget it with the years.



I didn’t respond at first. The image, twenty years later, pressed itself into my mind with the same sudden sharpness it must have had in my father’s eyes that day. I could see it, standing there against the dark glass of the window, impossibly still. Unseen eyes boring holes into me



We didn’t speak about it again. Never to be brought up. The story dying with the last ember of his cigarette. But the memory lingered, as all the others did. The stairs, the closet, the basement light. A quiet reminder that some things, no matter how long ago, don’t end when you leave them behind.

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

Two years ago, I started working at a boutique during a really difficult period in my life. I had just been laid off from a tech job and my brother had passed away. I took the job to get myself back on my feet mentally, and I became very close with the assistant manager. We leaned on each other and built what felt like a solid, supportive friendship.

About a year later, I moved out of state to California for work. I got a job in medical billing and focused heavily on stabilizing myself financially and paying off my student loans. We stayed close, and since I wasn’t planning on traveling back home while focusing on debt, she came to visit me instead.

That visit ended up changing how I feel about the friendship.

It wasn’t one big incident, but a pattern of behavior that made me feel judged, criticized, and uncomfortable, especially in my own home.

Some specific moments that stood out:

When I picked her up from the airport, she said she was hungry. I took her to In-N-Out since it’s an iconic California spot. She criticized the fries and complained about there being a lot of high schoolers there (it was midnight on a Friday).

She assumed she would take my bed and questioned why I didn’t have an air mattress or pull out bed for myself. I ultimately gave her my bed to avoid conflict.

She made repeated comments about my roommate, criticizing her for a brief phone call, having the TV on at night, and the furniture she had in the front yard.

At Disneyland, we had agreed to get coffee beforehand. I missed the Starbucks entrance by a few feet, and she scoffed and rolled her eyes. When we reached Starbucks, she refused to wait in line and insisted we go elsewhere. I eventually told her I was going to Starbucks anyway.

Later, she told me that I was upset about the situation because I had a “sugar crash” from my chai latte.

When I needed to charge my phone, she questioned whether I “needed to be reachable.”

At one point I got sunscreen in my eye and couldn’t see properly. She told me to “cry it out” and seemed irritated when I said I wanted to rinse it out.

Individually, none of these moments are huge, but taken together, the tone felt dismissive and critical rather than supportive. I felt uncomfortable and on edge in my own home.

I brought this up to her later. She said she was shocked to learn she had done anything wrong, apologized, and said it wasn’t her intention, but also didn’t really understand why these things were hurtful.

I want to forgive her, but I can’t shake how the visit made me feel or how much it changed my perception of the friendship.

1pq6u2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1pq6u2o/sudden_stop/,Sudden stop,"M26, smoked since 14. I am writing this post not to brag about it, but to see if there are people who experienced a similar situation. As I already specified, I used to smoke since I was 14. I had some years when I smoked less than a pack/day, some years with 2 packs/day. So let's say an average of 1 pack/day for 11 years. Until I simply stopped. I woke up one morning, made myself a coffee, light a cig as usual and it just felt terrible. I couldn't finish it (normally smoked at least 2 while drinking coffee). Later that day, light up another one, still same disgust. It was the same brand of cigs I used to smoke for a long time, so there was no change, same routine, same coffee. For the next couple of days same story: once I took a few puffs I couldn't handle the taste, the smell, the sensation on my throat. I went to the doc, I thought I am sick or something but everything came back as normal. I must mention that I never intended to stop - at least not at that point in life. That happened at the beginning of Oct, that also being the last time I smoked cigs. The only way of handling tobacco was if I'd smoke joints (which I eventually quit again, but voluntarily). Does anyone experienced something similar? Is there an explanation? Was it a divine intervention? 🤣 I SWEAR that I am not lying with anything, I had this curiosity since some time ago, especially because some people in my life noticed I stopped smoking and asked me how I did it - and when I'd tell them the story I feel like they are not really convinced that this is how I quit (if this wouldn't happen to me, I'd had the same doubts).

I must mention that I have asthma, however that did not stopped me from smoking, as I found out 3 years before this strange quit happened.",2,1766103667.0,stopsmoking,4,1.0,False

She’s been dating her boyfriend, let’s call him Steve, for about 10 years. Recently, he proposed to her. For the past few years they’ve been long-distance, but Steve financially supported her the whole time — she lived in his apartment and didn’t pay rent or utilities. He’s not abusive, but if she was unhappy, she could leave.

This spring, she cheated on him at a party. I told her it was her choice, but I personally don’t support cheating. We talked it through and kept being friends.

Recently, she went to a club and sent me a photo of herself sitting in a car with another guy, drinking coffee. She didn’t explain anything. I just reacted neutrally. Ever since her first cheating incident, our friendship hasn’t felt the same.

A few days ago, she said she wants to “take a pause” from our friendship because of her state of mind. Last winter she did the same thing. I get needing space, but I don’t like how she frames it like we’re in a romantic relationship and need a pause.

I know why she does this — to avoid explaining her actions. I never chased her for explanations.

This time, I told her that as long as she keeps jumping between guys, she won’t get the stability she says she wants, and using her boyfriend for housing/financial support will eventually backfire. She always talks about wanting a better life, but does nothing to change it. I said more, but in the end I told her I wasn’t trying to control her, just stating that our friendship is ending due to different values. I told her she doesn’t need to reply.

After that, she deleted our entire Telegram chat — years of photos and messages gone — without asking if I wanted to save anything. I blocked her everywhere because I don’t want someone like that in my life anymore.

TL;DR: My friend repeatedly cheated on her boyfriend. I didn’t support it and told her honestly how I feel. She deleted all our chats and I blocked her. Am I a bad friend for not supporting her actions?",5,1766103437.0,relationships,6,0.69,False

They moved me out of the room today.

Doctor’s orders, apparently. “Change of environment.” “Stimulation.” Words like that. Two nurses helped me into the wheelchair and pushed me down halls I hadn’t seen yet. More doors. More checkpoints. It’s strange how quickly your sense of distance disappears when you’re no longer the one moving yourself.

The common area is meant to feel alive.

Open space. Softer lighting. A few other patients scattered around, most of them quiet, all of them watched. Windows that look out onto something green that’s probably real, but carefully chosen. It smells faintly like disinfectant and coffee that’s been sitting too long.

They parked me where I could see the television.

It was already on.

An ad for Baseline.

Of course it was.

I laughed before I meant to. Just a short sound, more air than humor. The timing was almost impressive. As if the place knew exactly what would keep me grounded.

The screen showed smiling children first. Always children. Bright-eyed. Focused. Calm in a way that looks practiced. A voice talked about potential and support and helping young minds reach their baseline. That word again, like it ever meant the same thing twice.

Then came the adults. Productive. Healthy. Moving through cities like the one outside these walls. Building things. Discovering things. Living longer than anyone used to.

I muttered under my breath, something like, “Notice how no one ever misses a dose.”

One of the nurses smiled like she wasn’t sure if I was joking.

The ad kept going.

Side effects listed quickly, politely. As if speed made them lighter. Cognitive shifts. Dependency. Do not discontinue use. I filled in the rest in my head, because they never say it the way it actually is.

Stopping may result in death.

I said that part out loud.

Not loudly. Just enough for myself.

The commercial ended the way they all do. Assurance. Stability. A promise that this is normal, that this is good, that this is the best version of us. The screen switched to something else, but the feeling stayed.

Sitting there, legs useless, gown hanging wrong, watching a drug that reshaped the world sell itself like a children’s vitamin, I couldn’t help it.

I said, “Very reassuring,” and snorted quietly.

It felt good to make fun of it. Even just a little. Like I still had some angle on the world that wasn’t prescribed.

They left me there for a while. People came and went. No one talked much. I watched the room instead. Watched how carefully alive everything was.

Eventually they wheeled me back.

I’m tired now. More than I should be for someone who didn’t do anything.

Still, I’m glad I went.

It reminded me that even here, even like this, I can still recognize the joke.

I’m going to stop before my hands start buzzing too.

I’ll write again tomorrow.

Day 22

Group session today.

There were fewer people again.

I noticed it before anyone spoke. The empty spaces do that thing where they announce themselves without sound. No explanations. No acknowledgment. Just absence arranged neatly enough that you’re not supposed to stare at it.

Everyone looked worse.

Not dramatically. Just… worn down. Like the effort it takes to stay upright had increased overnight and no one had been warned. One man’s hands shook openly now. No attempt to hide it. A woman kept blinking hard, like her eyes wouldn’t agree on what they were seeing. Minds still sharp, though. You could hear it when they talked. Clear sentences wrapped around failing bodies.

When it was my turn, I said my legs still weren’t working.

That got written down.

I didn’t add anything else. I didn’t want to hear my own voice explain it.

Then one of the others spoke.

He didn’t wait for a question.

He said, “I want to die.”

Not loudly. Not dramatically. Just flat. Like he was stating a preference for the temperature in the room. For a second, I thought maybe I’d misheard him, but no one reacted like they had.

The therapist asked him to elaborate.

He said he was tired. He said he remembered when stopping Baseline wasn’t an option, but it was at least an ending. He said living like this felt like being held in place while everything else fell apart slowly and politely.

He said he wanted it to be over.

No one interrupted him.

No one reassured him.

Someone wrote something down.

I felt my hands curl into fists without deciding to. My legs buzzed uselessly, static humming under the blanket, like they were trying to participate in something they couldn’t reach anymore.

The therapist thanked him for sharing.

That phrase landed wrong. I don’t know what the right phrase would’ve been, but it wasn’t that.

The session ended shortly after. No summary. No encouragement. We were dismissed the same way we always are, like what had just been said fit cleanly into the schedule.

On the way out, I realized I hadn’t heard anyone say they felt hopeful today.

Not once.

Back in my room, the quiet felt heavier than usual. I keep replaying his voice in my head. Not the words. The tone. The calm certainty of it. Like he’d finally stopped pretending there was another acceptable answer.

I don’t know what they do with statements like that.

I don’t know what they’re allowed to do.

I know I won’t forget it.

My hands feel tired. My legs still aren’t mine. The room watches quietly, like it’s waiting to see which of us blinks first.

I’m going to stop here.

I don’t trust what I’d write if I kept going.

———

Day 23

I kept thinking about what he said.

I tried not to. I told myself it wasn’t my business, that this place is full of things you’re not supposed to carry home with you. But I don’t go anywhere anymore. There’s no distance to put between me and it.

“I want to die.”

He didn’t sound sad when he said it. That’s what keeps replaying. No shaking voice. No anger. Just tired. Like he’d finally landed on the most honest sentence he had left.

I woke up with that sentence already in my head.

My legs were the same. Still not responding. I went through the motions anyway—press the button, wait, let someone else decide when I’m upright. The nurse talked to me like it was any other morning. Asked how I slept. Asked if I was in pain.

I said no.

That wasn’t the truth, but it was close enough that correcting it felt like too much work.

They wheeled me out for a bit. Said it was good for morale. I don’t know whose. The common area felt emptier than yesterday. I didn’t count. I didn’t need to. You can feel when a room has lost people.

No one talked much.

I kept wondering if the man from yesterday was still here. I kept wondering if he’d regret saying it out loud. Or if saying it was the only thing that still felt like control.

That thought bothered me more than I expected.

Back in my room, I stared at the ceiling for a long time. The camera blinked once. I blinked back, which felt stupid immediately after I did it. Still did it.

Writing is slower today. I keep stopping to make sure I’m actually thinking the thought I’m writing, not just repeating something that sounds right. It’s harder to tell the difference now.

I don’t feel like I want to die.

I feel like I understand why someone might.

That scares me enough that I’m writing it down instead of letting it sit quietly where it could get comfortable.

My therapist hasn’t come by. Maybe she will tomorrow. Maybe she won’t. I don’t know if I want more answers right now or fewer.

I just know that sentence didn’t disappear when the session ended.

It stayed.

I’m going to stop here before I start circling it instead of moving past it.

I’ll write again tomorrow.

———

Day 25

I missed a day.

They told me that this morning. Not in a dramatic way. Just a note. Like correcting a chart. I asked which day it was now and they said Tuesday, and I nodded even though Tuesday doesn’t feel like anything.

Saturday was the first day. I know that. I’ve checked the math more than once. So this is Tuesday. That part is right. It’s everything around it that feels wrong.

There’s nothing where yesterday should be.

Not blank exactly. Just… not there. I don’t remember sleeping through it. I don’t remember deciding not to write. I don’t remember being awake either. It’s like the day folded in on itself and disappeared.

My legs still aren’t working. I know that because they tell me they aren’t and because I look at them and they don’t move. Sometimes I feel like they’re about to, like the signal is almost there, and then it isn’t. Static. Always static.

They moved me this morning and I forgot where I was going halfway there. The hallway felt longer than it should have. Or shorter. I can’t tell which. The nurse said my name and I answered, but it took effort to line it up with my mouth. I felt the pause. That part scared me.

I tried to read again today. Same problem. I can see the words but they don’t hold together. I’ll get to the end of a sentence and forget why I started it. That’s happening here too. I have to reread every paragraph to remember what I was trying to say. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn’t and I don’t know which one is worse.

There are fewer people.

I don’t know how I know that because I didn’t see everyone. It’s just quieter in a way I recognize now. Like the building has learned how to breathe around missing bodies.

I keep thinking about the man who said he wanted to die. I can’t picture his face anymore. I think I remember his voice, but I’m not sure if I’m remembering it or rebuilding it. That line is getting harder to see.

The camera is still there. I forgot about it for a while today. When I noticed it again, it felt sudden and sharp, like realizing someone has been standing behind you the whole time. I lifted my hand a little, then stopped. I don’t know why.

Writing is slower. My hand feels disconnected from the thought. Like I’m dictating to someone who doesn’t quite speak the same language I do. I know what I want to say and then it comes out bent.

I don’t like that I missed a day.

I don’t like that I didn’t notice.

If another one goes missing, I’m not sure I’ll be able to tell you.

It’s Tuesday.

I’m writing that down so it stays true.

I’m going to stop here before the words get any looser.

I’ll write again tomorrow. If tomorrow still shows up.


———

Day 26

Something is wrong with the room.

Not broken. Not malfunctioning. Just wrong in a way that doesn’t give you anything specific to point at.

I woke up and couldn’t tell if the lights had already shifted or if I’d been awake when they did. I lay there trying to remember falling asleep and kept sliding past it, like my mind refused to land on the moment where yesterday ended. Tuesday feels thin now. Like paper you can see light through.

They told me it’s Wednesday.

I wrote it down immediately because it didn’t feel like it would stay put on its own.

My legs are still gone. Not numb. Not asleep. Gone in the sense that when I try to think move, nothing even answers back anymore. Yesterday there was static. Today it’s quieter. That scares me more.

Silence feels final.

They didn’t move me this morning. No wheelchair. No hallway. Just checks done in the room. Blood pressure. Pupils. Reflexes I don’t have. One of them pressed hard into my thigh and asked if I felt it. I said yes because I did, and because the idea of not feeling it felt worse.

When they left, I realized the door hadn’t made a sound when it opened or closed.

I don’t remember when that started.

The camera blinked while I was eating. I know it blinked because I was counting the seconds between breaths and the rhythm broke. I stared at it until my eyes watered. It didn’t blink again.

I tried to think about my parents.

That felt important. Anchoring. Like if I could hold onto something solid, the rest of me might stay arranged correctly. But the images came apart as soon as I touched them. Faces without mouths. Voices without words. I know they were religious. I know that mattered. I can’t remember what my mother’s voice sounded like anymore and that hit me harder than losing my legs.

I don’t know when that went missing.

I heard someone screaming earlier.

Not nearby. Down the hall. Muffled, like it was happening through several layers of decisions. It stopped suddenly. No echo. No explanation. The quiet afterward felt intentional, like the building exhaled.

No one mentioned it.

That’s when the fear settled in properly.

I tried to write earlier and couldn’t remember how to start a sentence. Not what to say. How to begin. My hand hovered over the page until it started shaking. I don’t know how long I sat like that before the first word came out wrong.

I keep thinking about the man who said he wanted to die.

I understand him more today than I want to admit.

Not because I want to die.

Because I want this to stop progressing. I want whatever is happening to pick a speed and stay there instead of creeping forward while I watch parts of myself get shut off without ceremony.

I checked the door again.

Still no lock. Still no handle on my side that does anything useful. I pressed my palm against it and waited for something to happen. Nothing did. I don’t know if that means it’s locked or if it just doesn’t need to be.

I’m scared that if I don’t write this down, it won’t count as having happened.

I’m scared that even if I do, it won’t matter.

My hands feel colder than the rest of me. That’s new. I keep flexing my fingers to make sure they still answer. They do. For now.

If tomorrow is worse, I don’t know how I’ll describe it.

If tomorrow doesn’t come, I don’t know how anyone will notice.

It’s Wednesday.

I think.

I’m going to stop now because the room feels like it’s listening, and I don’t know what it does with the things it hears.

———

Day 27

I woke up seeing less.

Not darkness. Not black. Just… gaps. Like parts of the room didn’t load all the way. The ceiling light was there, but the edges of it felt soft, like I couldn’t quite agree on where it ended. I blinked hard a few times and it sharpened a little, enough to convince me it was just sleep.

It wasn’t.

By the time they came in to check on me, I was already squinting. Faces looked wrong. Too flat. Like depth was something I had to guess at instead of perceive. I didn’t say anything at first. I wanted to know how fast it was happening before I gave it a name.

It sped up.

The right side went first. Not gone—just dimmer. Like someone slowly turning a dial down. When I closed my left eye, the room faded into a gray smear. I opened it again quickly, heart pounding, like that would stop it.

It didn’t.

They noticed when I missed the cup they handed me. It clattered against the bed and spilled water everywhere. I laughed reflexively, like it was nothing. That laugh came out wrong. Too loud. Too sharp. Someone told me to stay calm.

Someone else left the room.

The world kept narrowing.

Colors started bleeding into each other. The walls lost their edges. The camera in the corner turned into a dark suggestion instead of a shape. I could still see my hands for a while, but they didn’t look like mine anymore. Too pale. Too far away. Like they belonged to someone I was watching.

I asked what was happening.

They told me to keep my eyes open.

That felt cruel.

By midday, light hurt. Not pain exactly—pressure. Like my eyes were being asked to do something they couldn’t anymore. I started keeping them closed without realizing it. Every time I opened them again, there was less waiting for me.

I can’t tell you when the last clear thing disappeared.

I just know that at some point the room stopped being a place and became a glow.

I asked for my journal.

I don’t know if they hesitated or if that’s something I imagined afterward. They put it in my hands. I had to feel for the edges of the page. The lines are harder to track now. The ink is starting to disappear as I write it, like it’s afraid to stay.

I’m writing slower. Not because I want to be careful. Because I can’t see where the words are going.

The page keeps slipping sideways. Or maybe my sense of sideways is wrong now too. That’s possible. A lot of things are possible suddenly.

I can’t see the camera anymore.

That should make me feel better.

It doesn’t.

I don’t know if my therapist knows this is happening yet. I don’t know if today is still Thursday. I don’t know how much of this is temporary and how much is something closing for good.

The light is almost gone now. Not black. Just nothing I can use. I’m trying to finish this before it all turns into—

I can’t see the line anymore
I’m still writing I think
I can’t tell where the page ends
If someone reads this
I’m still here
I’m still—

———

Day 29

They told me I could keep writing.

That’s the word they used. Writing. I held onto it harder than I probably should have.

They set something up beside the bed. I don’t know what it looks like. I didn’t ask. Someone adjusted it near my face and told me it was recording. They said it would turn my words into text. They said I wouldn’t lose anything that way.

I don’t believe that, but I didn’t argue.

I asked where the journal was.

They said this is the journal now.

That took a minute to land. I kept my eyes open while they were talking even though it doesn’t make a difference anymore. I still do that sometimes, like sight might come back if it sees me trying.

They told me to speak naturally.

That scared me more than the blindness.

When I write, I can stop. I can pause mid-sentence. I can look at the page and decide not to finish a thought. Talking doesn’t have edges the same way. It keeps going unless someone stops it, and I don’t know who gets to decide that now.

I asked if it was recording already.

They said yes.

I don’t know how much it heard before I knew that.

I’m trying to talk slowly. I don’t know if it’s helping. Sometimes I lose track of where I am in a sentence and have to start over, but I don’t know if it deletes the first one or keeps both. I keep imagining pages filling up with half-thoughts and no one bothering to clean them up.

That feels like a good description of me lately.

The room sounds bigger when you can’t see it. Every noise feels like it comes from farther away than it should. Footsteps echo longer. The hum stretches. Even my own voice sounds like it’s not coming from where I am.

I miss the pen.

I miss knowing that my hand made the marks. That if something came out wrong, it was still mine. Talking feels like handing the words off to someone else and hoping they don’t drop them.

They told me I’m doing well.

I don’t know what that means anymore.

I asked if I could listen to what I’ve “written” later. They said we could talk about that. I don’t like that answer. It sounds like the kind you give when you don’t plan on saying yes.

I keep wondering if this still sounds like me on the page. If the sentences come out smoother than they should. If the pauses disappear. If the system fixes things I would’ve left broken on purpose.

If that happens, I don’t know how I’ll know.

I’m tired. Talking takes more out of me than writing ever did. My throat hurts. My head feels full in a way that doesn’t belong to thoughts.

They told me I could stop whenever I wanted.

I didn’t believe that either.

I’m going to stop now anyway, just to prove I can.

If this is still my journal, I want the ending to be something I chose.

———

Day 30

They brought me to the group session today.

I didn’t know where I was until the room spoke back to me. Chairs moving. Fabric shifting. Someone clearing their throat. Familiar sounds arranged in an unfamiliar way. I waited for the others. For breathing. For the small, human noises that used to fill these sessions.

I only heard one voice.

At first I thought I’d missed something. That my hearing was going too. I asked if everyone was seated. No one answered. The silence pressed in so hard it felt physical.

Then the voice spoke again.

Just one person.

That’s when it settled in. Not all at once. Piece by piece. Like my mind didn’t want to carry the full weight of it yet.

There aren’t any others.

I said it out loud without meaning to. “Where is everyone?”

No answer.

I swallowed and asked the only question that made sense. I asked the voice who they were.

They hesitated before answering. I could hear it. A pause long enough to decide whether to lie.

They said their name.

I don’t remember it now. Or maybe I never caught it properly. What mattered was what came next.

I asked if they were from the child trial.

Another pause.

Then they said yes.

The other one.

The only other person who survived.

I felt something break open in my chest that I didn’t have a name for. Relief didn’t fit. Fear didn’t either. It felt more like recognition without memory. Like finding proof of something you were never allowed to know.

I asked where the therapist was.

No answer.

I said her name.

Still nothing.

My voice started to shake then, and I didn’t try to stop it. I asked her to stop this. To stop the trial. To stop whatever this had turned into.

She didn’t answer because she wasn’t there.

A different voice spoke instead. Calm. Male. Clinical.

He said my therapist wouldn’t be coming back.

He said this was the final group session.

He said the trial would conclude in two more days.

That’s when I said it.

I said I wouldn’t be taking any more pills.

I expected resistance. An argument. A warning. Something rehearsed.

The doctor sounded confused.

He asked, “What pill?”

I didn’t understand at first. I told him the drug. The one I’ve been on. The one everyone’s been on. The one that started all of this.

There was another pause.

Then he said something I wasn’t prepared for.

He said all trial participants only took one pill.

One.

At the very beginning.

He said everything else was observation.

I felt cold all over.

I asked him to repeat it.

He didn’t.

The room stayed quiet after that. No one rushed in. No alarms. Just one other survivor breathing somewhere across from me, and a truth that didn’t fit inside my body anymore.

If that’s true, if this has all been from one pill, then I don’t know where the drug ends and I begin.

I don’t know if I ever stopped taking it.

I don’t know if anyone ever has.

They told me the session was over.

They told me they’d take me back to my room.

I didn’t answer.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to say now.

If this is the last stretch, I don’t know what survives it.

I’m stopping here.

I don’t trust what comes out of me after this.

———

Day 31

I can’t move.

Not my legs. Not my arms. Not my hands. Nothing answers anymore. There’s no static now. No buzzing. Just a clean, terrifying silence where my body used to be.

I’m awake. I know that because I can think. I can hear. I can feel the bed under me, the pressure points, the places where my weight settles and doesn’t shift. Breathing is happening without asking me first. That feels wrong, like my body has decided it doesn’t need my input.

They noticed when I didn’t respond to my name.

I wanted to answer. I knew the word. I knew how it should feel to say it. My mouth didn’t move. My tongue stayed where it was. Panic hit hard then, fast and sharp, and I couldn’t even show it.

Someone said, “He’s conscious.”

Someone else said, “Good.”

They asked me to blink if I could hear them.

I did.

That’s all I have left.

Blink once for yes. Twice for no. They explained it carefully, like you would to a child. I wanted to scream at them that I understood, that I’d always understood, but the thought just stayed where it was and went nowhere.

They repositioned me. Turned me slightly so I wouldn’t develop sores. Hands everywhere, efficient, practiced. I hated how familiar my body felt to them when it doesn’t feel like mine anymore.

They asked if I was in pain.

Blink once.

They asked if I was scared.

I didn’t blink right away. That felt like the only control I had. Then I did.

The dictation thing is back. They told me they’d keep documenting “my thoughts” as long as I was able to participate. Someone is reading this back to me as I go, stopping when I blink. I don’t know if it sounds like me. I don’t know if it ever will again.

I keep thinking about what the doctor said yesterday.

One pill.

I keep wondering if this is it. If this is what the drug looks like when it finally finishes what it started. Not death. Just containment. A mind preserved inside something that no longer qualifies as a body.

I tried to imagine dying just now.

I couldn’t picture it.

That feels like the cruelest part.

They told me there’s one more day after this. Then the trial ends. They said it like an ending is something you can schedule.

If I could move, I’d tear this place apart.

If I could speak, I’d beg them to stop.

If I could look at myself, I don’t know what I’d see.

I’m still here.

I’m still thinking.

If this stops suddenly—
if there’s nothing after this—
I need whoever reads this to know that I didn’t fade.

I was awake the whole time.

Blink.

———

Day 32

Light.

That’s the first thing. Not seeing it—knowing it. Knowing where it comes from and where it goes when it leaves. Knowing it has edges even before I understand what edges are.

Sound comes next. Voices layered on top of each other, careful and excited and afraid in ways they don’t yet know how to hide. I don’t have words for them yet, but I understand intention before language. That feels important.

I am small.

I know this because everything else is too large and too loud and too much. My body is wrong in ways I can’t describe, but my mind is suddenly very right. Awake. Awake is the word they’ll use later. To me it feels like a door opening inward forever.

Pieces move.

Not physically. Conceptually. Like a board unfolding in my head. Black and white squares, infinite in both directions. Every move creates ten more. I don’t know what chess is yet, but I understand inevitability. I understand sacrifice. I understand that some openings only exist to force an end.

The doctors ask me questions I don’t answer.

They say they have 6 no’s and only need one yes.

They don’t notice yet that I already know the questions they’ll ask tomorrow. And the next day. And years from now when the drug has a name and a logo and a jingle and a warning spoken too fast to hear.

I see the world.

Not as it is. As it will be.

Cities built too quickly on intelligence mistaken for wisdom. Borders drawn and redrawn because someone optimized suffering into a strategy. Lines of people waiting for pills like prayers. Bodies that don’t die when they should and minds that never get to rest. War not because people are stupid, but because they are certain.

I see cancer walking through streets and being greeted politely. I see death treated like a maintenance issue. I see myself older, blind, silent, laid out neatly in a room that watches me breathe.

I see this moment looping.

The board is full now. Every move visible. Every outcome stacked. There are paths where I don’t speak and paths where I do, but none where the pieces stop moving once they start.

The doctors lean in.

They’re smiling. Hope looks like hunger when it’s new.

One of them asks me how I feel.

It’s the first real question anyone has asked me.

I know that if I answer, the world begins.

I also know that if I don’t, it ends here. Quiet. Contained. One room. One child who never becomes a future.

My mouth knows how to make the words. I’ve already practiced them a thousand times ahead.

I hesitate.

For the first time, I consider mercy. I will not let the future i lived happen 

And then—

I hear another breath.

There is someone else in the room.

I hadn’t needed to look to know they were there. Another small body, same as me. Another mind waking up the same way mine is. Parallel boards unfolding at the same time. Sitting beside me. Two openings. Two possibilities. 

The doctors turn toward them.

Before I can decide.
Before I can choose silence.
Before I can stop the pieces from moving—

The other child opens their mouth to answer them.

And the world begins anyway.",1,1766103239.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

Need advice.,"I’ve been on the job for 4 years now. I’m assigned to the busiest engine in our district with a LT and a probie firefighter. My Capt. put me in this role because he said i’m good junior guy who can show the new guys the way. Been on this rig for 6 months and love it. I took over the coffee fund and got involved in keeping the house up to par. Only one problem. 

There is a firefighter in my group, let’s just say he is a real piece of work. He was put on administrative leave for an incident at an EMS call where he told an EDP who wanted to kill himself “maybe you should do it” it was all on police body cam and everything. He was also arrested for violating order of protection. 38 charges have been filed against him. He was out of work since February. Our policy is if you are out more than a year no matter what the situation you are terminated. 

He is facing multiple felonies but it looks like he is accepting a plea deal and will only have misdemeanor charges. If convicted of the misdemeanors he would not lose his job right away but would have to go in front of the commissioners where they would vote on him staying or not. 

Why does this matter to me? If he keeps his job he will be placed on my rig because he would need to be with an officer. I would then be bumped from my spot. I would be lying if I said I’m not pissed about it. What can I do, if anything, to try and deal with this situation. You think a conversation with the Capt. would help?

They moved me out of the room today.

Doctor’s orders, apparently. “Change of environment.” “Stimulation.” Words like that. Two nurses helped me into the wheelchair and pushed me down halls I hadn’t seen yet. More doors. More checkpoints. It’s strange how quickly your sense of distance disappears when you’re no longer the one moving yourself.

The common area is meant to feel alive.

Open space. Softer lighting. A few other patients scattered around, most of them quiet, all of them watched. Windows that look out onto something green that’s probably real, but carefully chosen. It smells faintly like disinfectant and coffee that’s been sitting too long.

They parked me where I could see the television.

It was already on.

An ad for Baseline.

Of course it was.

I laughed before I meant to. Just a short sound, more air than humor. The timing was almost impressive. As if the place knew exactly what would keep me grounded.

The screen showed smiling children first. Always children. Bright-eyed. Focused. Calm in a way that looks practiced. A voice talked about potential and support and helping young minds reach their baseline. That word again, like it ever meant the same thing twice.

Then came the adults. Productive. Healthy. Moving through cities like the one outside these walls. Building things. Discovering things. Living longer than anyone used to.

I muttered under my breath, something like, “Notice how no one ever misses a dose.”

One of the nurses smiled like she wasn’t sure if I was joking.

The ad kept going.

Side effects listed quickly, politely. As if speed made them lighter. Cognitive shifts. Dependency. Do not discontinue use. I filled in the rest in my head, because they never say it the way it actually is.

Stopping may result in death.

I said that part out loud.

Not loudly. Just enough for myself.

The commercial ended the way they all do. Assurance. Stability. A promise that this is normal, that this is good, that this is the best version of us. The screen switched to something else, but the feeling stayed.

Sitting there, legs useless, gown hanging wrong, watching a drug that reshaped the world sell itself like a children’s vitamin, I couldn’t help it.

I said, “Very reassuring,” and snorted quietly.

It felt good to make fun of it. Even just a little. Like I still had some angle on the world that wasn’t prescribed.

They left me there for a while. People came and went. No one talked much. I watched the room instead. Watched how carefully alive everything was.

Eventually they wheeled me back.

I’m tired now. More than I should be for someone who didn’t do anything.

Still, I’m glad I went.

It reminded me that even here, even like this, I can still recognize the joke.

I’m going to stop before my hands start buzzing too.

I’ll write again tomorrow.

———

Day 22

Group session today.

There were fewer people again.

I noticed it before anyone spoke. The empty spaces do that thing where they announce themselves without sound. No explanations. No acknowledgment. Just absence arranged neatly enough that you’re not supposed to stare at it.

Everyone looked worse.

Not dramatically. Just… worn down. Like the effort it takes to stay upright had increased overnight and no one had been warned. One man’s hands shook openly now. No attempt to hide it. A woman kept blinking hard, like her eyes wouldn’t agree on what they were seeing. Minds still sharp, though. You could hear it when they talked. Clear sentences wrapped around failing bodies.

When it was my turn, I said my legs still weren’t working.

That got written down.

I didn’t add anything else. I didn’t want to hear my own voice explain it.

Then one of the others spoke.

He didn’t wait for a question.

He said, “I want to die.”

Not loudly. Not dramatically. Just flat. Like he was stating a preference for the temperature in the room. For a second, I thought maybe I’d misheard him, but no one reacted like they had.

The therapist asked him to elaborate.

He said he was tired. He said he remembered when stopping Baseline wasn’t an option, but it was at least an ending. He said living like this felt like being held in place while everything else fell apart slowly and politely.

He said he wanted it to be over.

No one interrupted him.

No one reassured him.

Someone wrote something down.

I felt my hands curl into fists without deciding to. My legs buzzed uselessly, static humming under the blanket, like they were trying to participate in something they couldn’t reach anymore.

The therapist thanked him for sharing.

That phrase landed wrong. I don’t know what the right phrase would’ve been, but it wasn’t that.

The session ended shortly after. No summary. No encouragement. We were dismissed the same way we always are, like what had just been said fit cleanly into the schedule.

On the way out, I realized I hadn’t heard anyone say they felt hopeful today.

Not once.

Back in my room, the quiet felt heavier than usual. I keep replaying his voice in my head. Not the words. The tone. The calm certainty of it. Like he’d finally stopped pretending there was another acceptable answer.

I don’t know what they do with statements like that.

I don’t know what they’re allowed to do.

I know I won’t forget it.

My hands feel tired. My legs still aren’t mine. The room watches quietly, like it’s waiting to see which of us blinks first.

I’m going to stop here.

I don’t trust what I’d write if I kept going.

———

Day 23

I kept thinking about what he said.

I tried not to. I told myself it wasn’t my business, that this place is full of things you’re not supposed to carry home with you. But I don’t go anywhere anymore. There’s no distance to put between me and it.

“I want to die.”

He didn’t sound sad when he said it. That’s what keeps replaying. No shaking voice. No anger. Just tired. Like he’d finally landed on the most honest sentence he had left.

I woke up with that sentence already in my head.

My legs were the same. Still not responding. I went through the motions anyway—press the button, wait, let someone else decide when I’m upright. The nurse talked to me like it was any other morning. Asked how I slept. Asked if I was in pain.

I said no.

That wasn’t the truth, but it was close enough that correcting it felt like too much work.

They wheeled me out for a bit. Said it was good for morale. I don’t know whose. The common area felt emptier than yesterday. I didn’t count. I didn’t need to. You can feel when a room has lost people.

No one talked much.

I kept wondering if the man from yesterday was still here. I kept wondering if he’d regret saying it out loud. Or if saying it was the only thing that still felt like control.

That thought bothered me more than I expected.

Back in my room, I stared at the ceiling for a long time. The camera blinked once. I blinked back, which felt stupid immediately after I did it. Still did it.

Writing is slower today. I keep stopping to make sure I’m actually thinking the thought I’m writing, not just repeating something that sounds right. It’s harder to tell the difference now.

I don’t feel like I want to die.

I feel like I understand why someone might.

That scares me enough that I’m writing it down instead of letting it sit quietly where it could get comfortable.

My therapist hasn’t come by. Maybe she will tomorrow. Maybe she won’t. I don’t know if I want more answers right now or fewer.

I just know that sentence didn’t disappear when the session ended.

It stayed.

I’m going to stop here before I start circling it instead of moving past it.

I’ll write again tomorrow.

———

Day 25

I missed a day.

They told me that this morning. Not in a dramatic way. Just a note. Like correcting a chart. I asked which day it was now and they said Tuesday, and I nodded even though Tuesday doesn’t feel like anything.

Saturday was the first day. I know that. I’ve checked the math more than once. So this is Tuesday. That part is right. It’s everything around it that feels wrong.

There’s nothing where yesterday should be.

Not blank exactly. Just… not there. I don’t remember sleeping through it. I don’t remember deciding not to write. I don’t remember being awake either. It’s like the day folded in on itself and disappeared.

My legs still aren’t working. I know that because they tell me they aren’t and because I look at them and they don’t move. Sometimes I feel like they’re about to, like the signal is almost there, and then it isn’t. Static. Always static.

They moved me this morning and I forgot where I was going halfway there. The hallway felt longer than it should have. Or shorter. I can’t tell which. The nurse said my name and I answered, but it took effort to line it up with my mouth. I felt the pause. That part scared me.

I tried to read again today. Same problem. I can see the words but they don’t hold together. I’ll get to the end of a sentence and forget why I started it. That’s happening here too. I have to reread every paragraph to remember what I was trying to say. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn’t and I don’t know which one is worse.

There are fewer people.

I don’t know how I know that because I didn’t see everyone. It’s just quieter in a way I recognize now. Like the building has learned how to breathe around missing bodies.

I keep thinking about the man who said he wanted to die. I can’t picture his face anymore. I think I remember his voice, but I’m not sure if I’m remembering it or rebuilding it. That line is getting harder to see.

The camera is still there. I forgot about it for a while today. When I noticed it again, it felt sudden and sharp, like realizing someone has been standing behind you the whole time. I lifted my hand a little, then stopped. I don’t know why.

Writing is slower. My hand feels disconnected from the thought. Like I’m dictating to someone who doesn’t quite speak the same language I do. I know what I want to say and then it comes out bent.

I don’t like that I missed a day.

I don’t like that I didn’t notice.

If another one goes missing, I’m not sure I’ll be able to tell you.

It’s Tuesday.

I’m writing that down so it stays true.

I’m going to stop here before the words get any looser.

I’ll write again tomorrow. If tomorrow still shows up.


———

Day 26

Something is wrong with the room.

Not broken. Not malfunctioning. Just wrong in a way that doesn’t give you anything specific to point at.

I woke up and couldn’t tell if the lights had already shifted or if I’d been awake when they did. I lay there trying to remember falling asleep and kept sliding past it, like my mind refused to land on the moment where yesterday ended. Tuesday feels thin now. Like paper you can see light through.

They told me it’s Wednesday.

I wrote it down immediately because it didn’t feel like it would stay put on its own.

My legs are still gone. Not numb. Not asleep. Gone in the sense that when I try to think move, nothing even answers back anymore. Yesterday there was static. Today it’s quieter. That scares me more.

Silence feels final.

They didn’t move me this morning. No wheelchair. No hallway. Just checks done in the room. Blood pressure. Pupils. Reflexes I don’t have. One of them pressed hard into my thigh and asked if I felt it. I said yes because I did, and because the idea of not feeling it felt worse.

When they left, I realized the door hadn’t made a sound when it opened or closed.

I don’t remember when that started.

The camera blinked while I was eating. I know it blinked because I was counting the seconds between breaths and the rhythm broke. I stared at it until my eyes watered. It didn’t blink again.

I tried to think about my parents.

That felt important. Anchoring. Like if I could hold onto something solid, the rest of me might stay arranged correctly. But the images came apart as soon as I touched them. Faces without mouths. Voices without words. I know they were religious. I know that mattered. I can’t remember what my mother’s voice sounded like anymore and that hit me harder than losing my legs.

I don’t know when that went missing.

I heard someone screaming earlier.

Not nearby. Down the hall. Muffled, like it was happening through several layers of decisions. It stopped suddenly. No echo. No explanation. The quiet afterward felt intentional, like the building exhaled.

No one mentioned it.

That’s when the fear settled in properly.

I tried to write earlier and couldn’t remember how to start a sentence. Not what to say. How to begin. My hand hovered over the page until it started shaking. I don’t know how long I sat like that before the first word came out wrong.

I keep thinking about the man who said he wanted to die.

I understand him more today than I want to admit.

Not because I want to die.

Because I want this to stop progressing. I want whatever is happening to pick a speed and stay there instead of creeping forward while I watch parts of myself get shut off without ceremony.

I checked the door again.

Still no lock. Still no handle on my side that does anything useful. I pressed my palm against it and waited for something to happen. Nothing did. I don’t know if that means it’s locked or if it just doesn’t need to be.

I’m scared that if I don’t write this down, it won’t count as having happened.

I’m scared that even if I do, it won’t matter.

My hands feel colder than the rest of me. That’s new. I keep flexing my fingers to make sure they still answer. They do. For now.

If tomorrow is worse, I don’t know how I’ll describe it.

If tomorrow doesn’t come, I don’t know how anyone will notice.

It’s Wednesday.

I think.

I’m going to stop now because the room feels like it’s listening, and I don’t know what it does with the things it hears.

———

Day 27

I woke up seeing less.

Not darkness. Not black. Just… gaps. Like parts of the room didn’t load all the way. The ceiling light was there, but the edges of it felt soft, like I couldn’t quite agree on where it ended. I blinked hard a few times and it sharpened a little, enough to convince me it was just sleep.

It wasn’t.

By the time they came in to check on me, I was already squinting. Faces looked wrong. Too flat. Like depth was something I had to guess at instead of perceive. I didn’t say anything at first. I wanted to know how fast it was happening before I gave it a name.

It sped up.

The right side went first. Not gone—just dimmer. Like someone slowly turning a dial down. When I closed my left eye, the room faded into a gray smear. I opened it again quickly, heart pounding, like that would stop it.

It didn’t.

They noticed when I missed the cup they handed me. It clattered against the bed and spilled water everywhere. I laughed reflexively, like it was nothing. That laugh came out wrong. Too loud. Too sharp. Someone told me to stay calm.

Someone else left the room.

The world kept narrowing.

Colors started bleeding into each other. The walls lost their edges. The camera in the corner turned into a dark suggestion instead of a shape. I could still see my hands for a while, but they didn’t look like mine anymore. Too pale. Too far away. Like they belonged to someone I was watching.

I asked what was happening.

They told me to keep my eyes open.

That felt cruel.

By midday, light hurt. Not pain exactly—pressure. Like my eyes were being asked to do something they couldn’t anymore. I started keeping them closed without realizing it. Every time I opened them again, there was less waiting for me.

I can’t tell you when the last clear thing disappeared.

I just know that at some point the room stopped being a place and became a glow.

I asked for my journal.

I don’t know if they hesitated or if that’s something I imagined afterward. They put it in my hands. I had to feel for the edges of the page. The lines are harder to track now. The ink is starting to disappear as I write it, like it’s afraid to stay.

I’m writing slower. Not because I want to be careful. Because I can’t see where the words are going.

The page keeps slipping sideways. Or maybe my sense of sideways is wrong now too. That’s possible. A lot of things are possible suddenly.

I can’t see the camera anymore.

That should make me feel better.

It doesn’t.

I don’t know if my therapist knows this is happening yet. I don’t know if today is still Thursday. I don’t know how much of this is temporary and how much is something closing for good.

The light is almost gone now. Not black. Just nothing I can use. I’m trying to finish this before it all turns into—

I can’t see the line anymore
I’m still writing I think
I can’t tell where the page ends
If someone reads this
I’m still here
I’m still—

———

Day 29

They told me I could keep writing.

That’s the word they used. Writing. I held onto it harder than I probably should have.

They set something up beside the bed. I don’t know what it looks like. I didn’t ask. Someone adjusted it near my face and told me it was recording. They said it would turn my words into text. They said I wouldn’t lose anything that way.

I don’t believe that, but I didn’t argue.

I asked where the journal was.

They said this is the journal now.

That took a minute to land. I kept my eyes open while they were talking even though it doesn’t make a difference anymore. I still do that sometimes, like sight might come back if it sees me trying.

They told me to speak naturally.

That scared me more than the blindness.

When I write, I can stop. I can pause mid-sentence. I can look at the page and decide not to finish a thought. Talking doesn’t have edges the same way. It keeps going unless someone stops it, and I don’t know who gets to decide that now.

I asked if it was recording already.

They said yes.

I don’t know how much it heard before I knew that.

I’m trying to talk slowly. I don’t know if it’s helping. Sometimes I lose track of where I am in a sentence and have to start over, but I don’t know if it deletes the first one or keeps both. I keep imagining pages filling up with half-thoughts and no one bothering to clean them up.

That feels like a good description of me lately.

The room sounds bigger when you can’t see it. Every noise feels like it comes from farther away than it should. Footsteps echo longer. The hum stretches. Even my own voice sounds like it’s not coming from where I am.

I miss the pen.

I miss knowing that my hand made the marks. That if something came out wrong, it was still mine. Talking feels like handing the words off to someone else and hoping they don’t drop them.

They told me I’m doing well.

I don’t know what that means anymore.

I asked if I could listen to what I’ve “written” later. They said we could talk about that. I don’t like that answer. It sounds like the kind you give when you don’t plan on saying yes.

I keep wondering if this still sounds like me on the page. If the sentences come out smoother than they should. If the pauses disappear. If the system fixes things I would’ve left broken on purpose.

If that happens, I don’t know how I’ll know.

I’m tired. Talking takes more out of me than writing ever did. My throat hurts. My head feels full in a way that doesn’t belong to thoughts.

They told me I could stop whenever I wanted.

I didn’t believe that either.

I’m going to stop now anyway, just to prove I can.

If this is still my journal, I want the ending to be something I chose.

———

Day 30

They brought me to the group session today.

I didn’t know where I was until the room spoke back to me. Chairs moving. Fabric shifting. Someone clearing their throat. Familiar sounds arranged in an unfamiliar way. I waited for the others. For breathing. For the small, human noises that used to fill these sessions.

I only heard one voice.

At first I thought I’d missed something. That my hearing was going too. I asked if everyone was seated. No one answered. The silence pressed in so hard it felt physical.

Then the voice spoke again.

Just one person.

That’s when it settled in. Not all at once. Piece by piece. Like my mind didn’t want to carry the full weight of it yet.

There aren’t any others.

I said it out loud without meaning to. “Where is everyone?”

No answer.

I swallowed and asked the only question that made sense. I asked the voice who they were.

They hesitated before answering. I could hear it. A pause long enough to decide whether to lie.

They said their name.

I don’t remember it now. Or maybe I never caught it properly. What mattered was what came next.

I asked if they were from the child trial.

Another pause.

Then they said yes.

The other one.

The only other person who survived.

I felt something break open in my chest that I didn’t have a name for. Relief didn’t fit. Fear didn’t either. It felt more like recognition without memory. Like finding proof of something you were never allowed to know.

I asked where the therapist was.

No answer.

I said her name.

Still nothing.

My voice started to shake then, and I didn’t try to stop it. I asked her to stop this. To stop the trial. To stop whatever this had turned into.

She didn’t answer because she wasn’t there.

A different voice spoke instead. Calm. Male. Clinical.

He said my therapist wouldn’t be coming back.

He said this was the final group session.

He said the trial would conclude in two more days.

That’s when I said it.

I said I wouldn’t be taking any more pills.

I expected resistance. An argument. A warning. Something rehearsed.

The doctor sounded confused.

He asked, “What pill?”

I didn’t understand at first. I told him the drug. The one I’ve been on. The one everyone’s been on. The one that started all of this.

There was another pause.

Then he said something I wasn’t prepared for.

He said all trial participants only took one pill.

One.

At the very beginning.

He said everything else was observation.

I felt cold all over.

I asked him to repeat it.

He didn’t.

The room stayed quiet after that. No one rushed in. No alarms. Just one other survivor breathing somewhere across from me, and a truth that didn’t fit inside my body anymore.

If that’s true, if this has all been from one pill, then I don’t know where the drug ends and I begin.

I don’t know if I ever stopped taking it.

I don’t know if anyone ever has.

They told me the session was over.

They told me they’d take me back to my room.

I didn’t answer.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to say now.

If this is the last stretch, I don’t know what survives it.

I’m stopping here.

I don’t trust what comes out of me after this.

Day 31

I can’t move.

Not my legs. Not my arms. Not my hands. Nothing answers anymore. There’s no static now. No buzzing. Just a clean, terrifying silence where my body used to be.

I’m awake. I know that because I can think. I can hear. I can feel the bed under me, the pressure points, the places where my weight settles and doesn’t shift. Breathing is happening without asking me first. That feels wrong, like my body has decided it doesn’t need my input.

They noticed when I didn’t respond to my name.

I wanted to answer. I knew the word. I knew how it should feel to say it. My mouth didn’t move. My tongue stayed where it was. Panic hit hard then, fast and sharp, and I couldn’t even show it.

Someone said, “He’s conscious.”

Someone else said, “Good.”

They asked me to blink if I could hear them.

I did.

That’s all I have left.

Blink once for yes. Twice for no. They explained it carefully, like you would to a child. I wanted to scream at them that I understood, that I’d always understood, but the thought just stayed where it was and went nowhere.

They repositioned me. Turned me slightly so I wouldn’t develop sores. Hands everywhere, efficient, practiced. I hated how familiar my body felt to them when it doesn’t feel like mine anymore.

They asked if I was in pain.

Blink once.

They asked if I was scared.

I didn’t blink right away. That felt like the only control I had. Then I did.

The dictation thing is back. They told me they’d keep documenting “my thoughts” as long as I was able to participate. Someone is reading this back to me as I go, stopping when I blink. I don’t know if it sounds like me. I don’t know if it ever will again.

I keep thinking about what the doctor said yesterday.

One pill.

I keep wondering if this is it. If this is what the drug looks like when it finally finishes what it started. Not death. Just containment. A mind preserved inside something that no longer qualifies as a body.

I tried to imagine dying just now.

I couldn’t picture it.

That feels like the cruelest part.

They told me there’s one more day after this. Then the trial ends. They said it like an ending is something you can schedule.

If I could move, I’d tear this place apart.

If I could speak, I’d beg them to stop.

If I could look at myself, I don’t know what I’d see.

I’m still here.

I’m still thinking.

If this stops suddenly—
if there’s nothing after this—
I need whoever reads this to know that I didn’t fade.

I was awake the whole time.

Blink.

———

Day 32

Light.

That’s the first thing. Not seeing it—knowing it. Knowing where it comes from and where it goes when it leaves. Knowing it has edges even before I understand what edges are.

Sound comes next. Voices layered on top of each other, careful and excited and afraid in ways they don’t yet know how to hide. I don’t have words for them yet, but I understand intention before language. That feels important.

I am small.

I know this because everything else is too large and too loud and too much. My body is wrong in ways I can’t describe, but my mind is suddenly very right. Awake. Awake is the word they’ll use later. To me it feels like a door opening inward forever.

Pieces move.

Not physically. Conceptually. Like a board unfolding in my head. Black and white squares, infinite in both directions. Every move creates ten more. I don’t know what chess is yet, but I understand inevitability. I understand sacrifice. I understand that some openings only exist to force an end.

The doctors ask me questions I don’t answer.

They say they have 6 no’s and only need one yes.

They don’t notice yet that I already know the questions they’ll ask tomorrow. And the next day. And years from now when the drug has a name and a logo and a jingle and a warning spoken too fast to hear.

I see the world.

Not as it is. As it will be.

Cities built too quickly on intelligence mistaken for wisdom. Borders drawn and redrawn because someone optimized suffering into a strategy. Lines of people waiting for pills like prayers. Bodies that don’t die when they should and minds that never get to rest. War not because people are stupid, but because they are certain.

I see cancer walking through streets and being greeted politely. I see death treated like a maintenance issue. I see myself older, blind, silent, laid out neatly in a room that watches me breathe.

I see this moment looping.

The board is full now. Every move visible. Every outcome stacked. There are paths where I don’t speak and paths where I do, but none where the pieces stop moving once they start.

The doctors lean in.

They’re smiling. Hope looks like hunger when it’s new.

One of them asks me how I feel.

It’s the first real question anyone has asked me.

I know that if I answer, the world begins.

I also know that if I don’t, it ends here. Quiet. Contained. One room. One child who never becomes a future.

My mouth knows how to make the words. I’ve already practiced them a thousand times ahead.

I hesitate.

For the first time, I consider mercy. I will not let the future i lived happen 

And then—

I hear another breath.

There is someone else in the room.

I hadn’t needed to look to know they were there. Another small body, same as me. Another mind waking up the same way mine is. Parallel boards unfolding at the same time. Sitting beside me. Two openings. Two possibilities. 

The doctors turn toward them.

Before I can decide.
Before I can choose silence.
Before I can stop the pieces from moving—

The other child opens their mouth to answer them.

And the world begins anyway.",1,1766103197.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

1pq6kws,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pq6kws/a_form_of_manipulation/,A Form of Manipulation?," I went on a date with a guy and I enjoyed my time. After the little event we went to we got coffee. We talked a long time. To the point, he brought some personal stuff which some would say may be too and too soon to bring up. I guess that's trauma dumping. I really don't mind people opening up about their lives and experiences. That's why I enjoyed our conversation. However, later on I started questioning his intentions. One question he asked me was if I find myself attractive. I thought that was weird to ask and didn't do a great job responding (felt like it was a test and failed). But then it got me thinking about his intentions for sharing all the things that were personal.  Reading online it says it can be a form of manipulation. Not sure if he was actually connecting or it being a secret tactic.

What do you guys think? Am I overanalyzing this or would you feel the same way?

Also, I don't know if he's completely over his ex. He still lives with her and he said he knows that's a deal breaker for some. I don't know if he's telling the truth or what if he's secretly still with her? He brought her up a couple of times without me asking about his past relationship.

1pq6hdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pq6hdw/am_i_overreacting_about_this_situation/,Am I Overreacting about this situation?,"Hi, my name is Katty (fake name), I’m 19.

My friend Sarah (also a fake name) is 25.

She’s been dating her boyfriend, let’s call him Steve, for about 10 years. Recently, he proposed to her.

For the past few years they’ve been long-distance, but Steve has been financially supporting her the entire time. She lived in his apartment, didn’t pay rent or utilities — basically everything was covered by him. He’s not abusive or controlling or anything like that. He’s not perfect, but if she was truly unhappy, she could’ve left. She stayed because the situation worked for her.

This spring, she cheated on him at a party. I told her it was her choice, but that I personally don’t support cheating because it’s not normal or okay for me. We talked it through and kept being friends.

Recently, she went to a club and sent me a photo of herself sitting in a car with some random guy, drinking coffee. She didn’t explain anything. I just reacted with some neutral emojis and didn’t ask questions. Ever since her first time cheating, our friendship hasn’t felt the same.

A few days ago, she messaged me saying she needs to “take a pause” from our friendship because of her mental state and everything going on.

For context: last winter she did the exact same thing — asked for a “pause.” I understand that people need space sometimes, but I don’t like how she frames it like we’re in a relationship and need to take a break. I even told her back then that she could just say “I need some time,” without turning it into this dramatic pause.

I know why she does this. It’s so she doesn’t have to explain what she’s doing while we’re not talking. And honestly, I never chased her or pushed for explanations.

This time, I snapped. I told her that as long as she keeps jumping between two guys, she’ll never get the stability she says she wants. I also told her that using her boyfriend for housing and financial support will eventually come back to her like a boomerang.

She constantly talks about wanting a better life, but does absolutely nothing to change it. I told her that nothing will change unless she actually starts doing something.

I said more, but in the end I told her I wasn’t saying all this to control her life — I was saying it because I felt our friendship was coming to an end due to completely different values. I told her she didn’t need to reply, just to take it into consideration if she wanted.

I’ve never told her how to live her life. I’ve always believed it’s her responsibility to understand that actions have consequences.

After that, she said nothing — but she deleted our entire Telegram chat for both of us. Years of photos, messages, and memories, gone. She didn’t ask if I wanted to save anything.

After that, I honestly felt relieved. I blocked her everywhere because I don’t want someone like that in my life anymore.",2,1766102701.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

I speak now as a man who is defined by clarity. If I had been asked- referencing my definition- a few years ago, I would have hesitated, pondered, perhaps even zoned out in the ether of existentialism; eventually I would reply: Making my son happy.

If you asked me- once more referencing my definition- a few months ago; the words would practically fly from my lips like an uncaged crow: Survival. 

My son was killed by a drunk driver who- by taking my son- took a word from my vocabulary and mutilated it; violated it. Loved. I had to say I loved my son. I couldn’t wake up and look him in the blue marble eyes and smile and say: I love you. That word was taken from me by the last person I’d expect. 

His mother didn’t bother showing up to the funeral: “I don’t want to see my son like that, fucker!” translation: “I don’t have any clothes not stained with cum or soaked in crack smoke, fucker!” And other than me and my father-in-law, the pews were empty.

“Thank you for coming, Immanuel.” His hand was as soft as sandpaper but gentle.

“Of course, Kiddo. This isn’t something you face alone… Sasha not comin’?” His eyes kept mine open, kept them alert. I shook my head and he nodded his. It felt like his hand was glued to my back, keeping a constant, pleasant pressure on my shoulder. The service was short and despite paying for the lecture, I only had one person to eulogize to. 

“He never got to meet you. I’m sorry about that. Just everything with Sasha… I was so bitter. And I didn’t even know you existed till you just kinda… appeared while she was first showing… signs.”

“You don’t need to apologize. It’s not like I’ll never meet him. I’ll end up in the same garden he is. So will you.”

“I think I’m gonna be okay… I just need some time.”

“Well once you’re ready… I’ll call you.” I raised an eyebrow for a frame, but smiled crudely and nodded. I Ubered home- I suppose the driver was typically chatty, but picking up a tear stained man from a funeral house was a hint enough- and tipped the fella 15 bucks for the quality AC.

8 glasses of cinnamon pain killer were enough to get the tears to stop. As I went for a 9th, the first knock came. \*Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap.\* Through the peep hole I saw a lean white man with slick salt and pepper comb-over. He wore a black suit and tie. I opened the door, expecting a mormon and noticed he now wore glasses too. They were thin and circular. I must have missed them in my hasty once-over of him. I thought he looked better with them anyway so I didn’t pay it much mind. “Y– Yes?”

“Hey neighbor! I just moved in down the way, but the movers won’t have my stuff there till tomorrow. Could I borrow some lunch meat or something?”

“Um…” It was a weird question, but houses aren’t cheap, especially not in my area, so who am I to deny a man tight on cash. “Sure-”

“You look lost.” I was stunned for a moment. “Did you just move here too?” Relief escaped my lungs. My drunken gait was indifferent from a man lost in a new, too-big house. 

“No no… just a little… Little too many stiff ones.” I faked a chuckle and his chuckle followed, even faker than mine. It was oddly reassuring. He faked his laugh to make me feel better about faking mine. I smiled for the second time that day. “Do you wanna come in, get some coffee?”

He took two steps back and looked up at the sky with a sarcastic examination. “My dad always told me to play things safe, but where is the harm in living a little dangerously?” Now I actually chuckled and swung the door wide.

“Coffee at 6, you must be a Knievel.” He walked inside

“One, actually, but I prefer Lou.” And stayed for about 3 hours, sharing stories about his time serving as a missionary and pastor.

“It’s been a while, but Egypt was an oven! You simply cannot escape the heat. I can only imagine it’s worse now with global-warming and all.” \*Sip.\* “But, I was out there with a dozen of my guys trying to spread the ‘Oh-so-good word’ and help some of these people, but we-” He stifled laughter while he spoke. “We ended up getting chased out by some hippie in a damn curtain!” He practically screamed in laughter and I followed suit. “But, little did he know, I don’t get chased out that easily… Man, it’s getting late. I ought to head home– Thank you. Thank you for humoring an old fool.” He stood up and threw on his jacket.

“Of course. And thank \*you,\* I needed the laughter.”

“I always provide.” He bowed slightly and I chuffed. “You mind if I come around again, see how much more I can steal from ya?” he giggled and I wheezed.

“Come and take what you want anytime, friend.”

“Well I like your doors, so I’ll start there.” And once more I wheezed in a caffeinated-drunken gigglefit. He stuffed down his laughter and extended his hand for a shake. My hand rose, but was snatched back as my phone rang loudly. 

“Shoot–”

“No worries, get your call, bud. I’ll see ya later!”

I grit my teeth, embarrassed but nodded and waved, before shutting the door and rushing to my phone. “Immanuel?”

“Hey, Kiddo. I just wanted to check in on you.” The velvet gravel voice of Immanuel bucked in my ears and in my motion my stomach twisted to a knot. It felt years had passed since I thought of him- of anything other than booze, coffee, and conversation.

“I- I’m…” The world came back to me. “I’m… better. As \*better\* as I can be.”

“Good good. I was wondering, and you can say no, if you’d want to come to church with me Sunday?” 

“I- Uh… I don’t know if that’s where I belong. I don’t- I’m not-”

“I’m not asking you to. And, trust me when I say, you don’t need to. But it’ll help.”

I chewed on my cheek. “Alright. Where is it?”

“Don’t worry about that part, I’ll pick you up at 5:30am. Deal?”

“Deal.”

The next day, around 3pm, Lou: \*Tap Tap Tap,\* then cracked open my door and peered in. I craned my neck, cheeks slightly tear stained as I gripped a photo of my son in a Thomas the Tank engine costume me and him had DIY’d for Halloween.

“Hey, Bud… Bad time?”

“No no no… I’m just… thinkin’.”

“What an atrocious sin, oh how hell will punish you.” He cracked a meek smile. 

A humming chuckle rose in my throat but died there as well. He walked in, the suit was a dark shade of red today, nigh-black, and sat next to me on the couch after shutting the door softly. “Your kid?”

“Mhm. Elie. He’s 3 here and I swear he’s the cutest kid ever born.” My stomach dropped and fiery guilt swelled but swiftly died.

“I’d be hard pressed to disagree.”

“I uh, would work for days every October to help him choose what costume he wanted, Then we’d go get the materials and spend a week pouring our hearts into it- till it was perfect. Then he’d go out, and get maybe… 3 pounds candy. Guess how long that bucket would last?”

“2 days.”

“N– Yeah! Without fail! 2 days it’d empty and he’d say the same thing: ‘Never again dad, never again.’ I did everything to make him the happiest he could be. Make him know he was loved.” Gently, so gently I had at first thought the picture floated from my hands, Lou took the picture and stared at it with a distant glimmer in his eye.

“He’s in a better place now.”

Tears flowed again. “I hope so… If I had it my way, he’d be in his room right now, building some skyscraper with his magnet tiles. But, maybe he is. Just not here.” A rock grew in my throat and an opaque haze blurred my vision. “I’m sorry for… all this- can I get you coffee or a sandwich or something?”

“No no… I just wanted to swing by and say hi, I gotta unpack and’ll be at it all day.”

“I could help ya if you need?”

“No, I got a legion on payroll. After they get done doing all the grunt work, I’m gonna put on some blues and decorate till I’ve got no wall space left.”

“How far down the way are you?”

“You know the fork in the road, about a mile or two…” He conjured a mental map, “That way.” He gestured west. “The yellow one.”

“Oh… The manor house?! Wow… you’re \*rich\* rich.” 

“Yeah, she’s a nice place, no damned AC, but I’ve been through worse than heat.” He tapped the picture with his index finger then opened, and swiftly closed his mouth.

“What?”

“Oh nothing… I was just gonna ask… ask if I can keep this?” He looked queasily at me, embarrassed.

My lip pulled back behind my teeth, then relaxed. “Yeah… I got plenty.” 

He brightened. “Thank you!” He stood up and set his hand on my shoulder. “You were a good dad.”

“Thank y-” I barely remained intact. “Thank you.” And he left.

I went to bed that night with an alarm set for 4:00 so I could wake up, adjust, shower, dress, and get coffee made by 5:15 all to be ready by 5:30 for Immanuel. REM came quicker than usual and similarly, left quicker than typical. 

\*Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap… Tap Tap Tap\*

2:52am, the clock on my nightstand blared in red dashes. I sat up- floaty headed- and lurched towards the door out of my bedroom; sluggishly traveled down the hall, shambled down the stairs, and peeped through the peep hole. Lou stood facing away from the door in a maroon suit. I swung it open and was met with his smile, he had been facing the door; hadn’t he.

“Lou?” I grunted.

“Moses! I’m glad you’re up. May I come in?”

I hesitated, confused. “Ye- yeah, of course.” As he entered, I spotted that he held the picture of Elie in his hand. 

“I need to talk to you, my friend. Sit.”

“What’s up?” I said, more awake now.

“What I’m about to say… it’s gonna sound weird.”

“What?”

He rolled his tongue along his lips.”You’re son. How did he die?”

“Wha-”

“How did he die?”

“Don’t ask me tha-”

“Moses.” His face lost all luster and kindness.

“When the car… spun out: the back passenger seat slammed in a pole and… he was– Why are you asking me this!?”

Lou answered swiftly. “Who was the drunk driver that day?”

“No… please no.”

“Who?”

I began to weep. “Me… I had gotten… and I thought I could manage… but the rain… I lost control.” Lou dove to my feet, his hands cupping my face and directing my eyes towards his.

“Shush, shush… it’s okay, it’s okay. Look at me. I know the pain you feel. All too well. And- and… can help you. I can bring him back.”

“Wh-”

“I’ve done it before, brought people back from the other side. Myself a time. You can see Elie again. Have Elie again. all yours, like before.”

“How– No, no! It’s not right.”

“It’s perfectly right, because it’s what you want. Here.” His index finger tapped my heart. “I know, because I know it all.”

“How?”

“You just have to ask.”

“That’s… That’s it?” Lou nodded. My lips trembled and my body quaked. “Can you bring my son back?”

“Yes.” His hand rose, and so did mine. It glided forward then recoiled as my phone rang up the stairs. I turned to face Lou and he shrugged. “Now or never.” Without a thought, my hand swam forward, and shook his. “Congrats my friend. All things are how they should be.” My racing heart eased its pace and we both smiled. “Better go get that call.” He chuffed.

I dashed up the stairs, all hope and joy and passion reignited. Love came back to vocabulary. I raised the phone to my ear. “Hello?” I chirped.

“Why did you shake his hand?” Immanuel sobbed.

“What? Immanuel- what’s wrong?”

“I told you we’d see him in the garden someday. Did you want it that bad? Was it worth your soul?”

“What?”

“You could have saved yourself… I made you to be wise… how could you think so little?” And the call ended.

“Moses… He’s back.” He shouted. \*Lou\* shouted. Lou One. Low One. I dashed downstairs, tripping halfway down and riding my spine to the ground. I scrambled up and panned my gaze to Lou. Elie stood beside him, eyes wet with tears. “Say: Hi, Elie.”

“No!” I wailed, cascading to my knees.

“Yes…” I fell to my side and wept against the planks. “Get up Moses. You don’t have much time.” I clambered to my knees and crawled into the living room.

“Elie.” I sniffled.

“Dad?” Elie murmured. “Are you okay?”

“No…” I broke down again. 

“Moses… Look at me.” He knelt to my side and pulled me to my knees. “You have 10 minutes. Heaven will only let him be out here for 10. Short. Minutes. Mo. You already paid, no point in crying. Spend this well okay?” His voice was new. It was slicker and polished. It was soft. It was kind. He removed his pocket square and cleaned off my face of the water works. 

I shuddered toward Elie who smiled now that my complexion was less glum. “How are you, Buckshot?”

“Good, Dad! I've been at this pretty garden with Immanuel. There are all these fruits that I didn’t even know existed!” His smile was as bright as the day I lost him. His voice as innocent and curious as everyday he’d woken up. 

“That’s amazing…” We talked for what felt like an eternity with an end. Each minute felt like some grand and critical part of the world was falling away, but also: that it was used to its fullest before its loss. He told me of relatives he met and friends he had made. He spoke of the food and the music. The wings in the sky. 

“I can’t wait for you to see it, Dad.” Some part of me knew, but a glance to Lou confirmed it. 

“It’ll be a while before I do… But, I’m sure the wait will be worth it.” I held my son as the last lie I’d ever tell him fell away from my mouth. His warmth grew then dulled. Lou walked to my side, Elie’s soft skin becoming gritty as whatever he was made of turned to dust on the furniture.

It broke back out, tears cleaning and dragging away spots of the dust. “I’m sorry Mo. I really am.”

“You’re a fucking liar.”

“The worst part is: I can’t be… I’m not allowed to not do… this to people. Most of the time, I enjoy it. I get to look evil souls in the face as they come to understand. But, cases like these… I wish I didn’t have to.”

“What do you mean?”

“I wish you could know.” His cheeks became wet. “I’m so sorry, I was begging you’d say no… Goodbye, Mo. I’m moving today.” And he left. 

Clarity fills me now. Of definitions I’ve given myself, this one is- unironically- the clearest. I have been given a profound understanding of how many things are watching everything you do. How many things cheer and jeer. How little they lie. That’s the part that still hurts. More than any other. 

Demons lie, and they fail because of it. But, the Devil will give you nothing but the truth, and that's why he will always get you. They call him the king of lies, but not once, not with me or any other human past, present, or future; has he ever lied. 

He smiles, dresses well. Smells of honey and speaks so compassionately. He’s gentle and kind- so, so, so kind. His face is never the same, but it’s always only his. He will look like you least expect, but most enjoy. He will ask for little things, and soon he’ll ask for everything; and you’ll give it to him. 

You only have one hope. If you hear a knock (3 taps, 3 times) on your door and  the man on the other side of the door is dressed in a deep red suit that could almost be mistaken as black, don't answer.

1pq69yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TattooArtists/comments/1pq69yf/how_to_survive_tattooing_and_keep_your_shop_open/,How to Survive Tattooing and Keep Your Shop Open,"**1.) make good solid tattoos**

This is the number one most important rule. Just make good tattoos! The work will speak for itself. That tattoo you post on IG might get you a few appointments, the person wearing it will mention your name anytime someone compliments it. The client will give you a good review on google etc.. making good tattoos simply just translates to a demand for your work and increases your reputation. 

Take your time with making a tattoo. I know tattooers like to brag about how fast they are, and it’s definitely an achievement to make a clean finished tattoo at a quick pace, but speed doesn’t really mean anything if your work looks choppy and rushed. Make sure all your lines are crispy clean, blacks black, nice gradients on whips, and saturated colors.

Take your time with designs, have a color study done and a vision for the completion of the design. If you’re not that busy like only 2-3 appointments per week this shouldn’t be too much of an ask. Yeah it’s work outside shop hours sometimes, but you signed up for the job!

During my first apprenticeship, I was told that if I can take a design off the wall or create a better version of the client’s reference, that I would not have a hard time succeeding in tattooing. 

**2.) be a versatile tattooer**

It’s great to develop a style that’s your sort of signature trademark, but I’d argue that versatility is more important business-wise than a developed style. 

I was trained to approach tattooing as a trade and craft first, but it is a craft that can serve as a vehicle for artistic expression. You’re creating bodily adornments for someone else, your customer might want some little walk in fineline flowers,  not a bold traditional rose. One of my first lessons as an aspiring apprentice was to get familiar with girly Pinterest designs because that’s the bread and butter of the tattoo world at the moment. 

If you can’t give them what they want, they’ll just go somewhere else, or be super disappointed when their dainty fineline design gets made with a 11RL by some “mansplainer” trad bro who feels entitled and can’t bother to get familiar with a 3RL. So either learn how to do that stuff, refer them to someone else within the shop or refer them to a nearby shop where they can get a tattoo in that style. 

I’ve worked with so many tattooers who lie and say fineline doesn’t hold or make some fake BS up about it to gaslight the customer.  Some  of them even just lay a 11RL onto that fineline rib quote without saying anything, or worse.. today’s the first day they used a 3 and that tattoo is shakier than a shitting dog and more blown out than a baby’s dirty diaper. guess what happens then? you just piss off and run out another customer who’s gonna tell everyone about their fucked up experience, then they’ll wind up getting butchered at a PMU salon and be like “OMG YASSSS OBSESSED” cause they don’t know what a good tattoo looks like. Gee wonder why business is slow… just learn how to use a 3RL. And get a versatile array of styles.. traditional, black and gray, realism, portraits, fineline.. Your bank account will be happy. “Specialization” is a modern myth of the tattoo world. 

**3.)be cordial, be humble, be polite**

This one always boggles my mind. Some tattooers are just completely lacking in self awareness and basic manners. I understand that tattooing used to be a down n dirty business full of degenerates, but all walks of life get tattooed now. If someone walks into your shop and you address them like some dickhead “SUP WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT?!” it’s gonna turn a lot of customers off and they’re never gonna walk back in to your shop again. Not only does this hurt your reputation, it hurts the shop you work at and your coworkers. Tattooers with shitty abrasive attitudes, who think they’re rockstars and a gift from god,  or they show up to work looking like they just got out of bed wearing pajamas and slippers, don’t even have a drawing prepared and make the client wait hours before starting etc.. 

I’ve seen Tattooers get in legit dysfunctional couple tier arguments with customers or just make smug snarky remarks about what they want. I’ve seen tattooers show up hours late to appointments without saying anything to the client or their coworkers. Tattooing a woman in an intimate area and making her boyfriend/husband or friend wait up front. Talk shit about every tattooer and shop in town, talk shit about their own clients, Can’t even bother to wrap the tattoo when you’re done, never mind they can’t even bother to invest in second skin bandages.  

Basically every shop I’ve worked at has had at least 1 of these types of Tattooers working there. Tattooers like this are a cancer to shops and they’ll rot them from the inside. It will cause any artist worth keeping to leave. Shop owners should fire their ass and stop the rot.

Ultimately, all you gotta do is be nice to customers, be pleasant to be around, be humble, show some humility, work with their budget, be chill and respect your client’s time. Some tattooers didn’t spend 10 years in food service/retail before you tattooed and it shows. 

**4.) be available let people know where you are be receptive**

A common trend I notice on social media following other tattooers, is sometimes I have to do detective work to figure out where they work. then sometimes it’s more detective work trying to figure out where the shop is located. I don’t know how anyone in their respective area with a social media presence like this expects to get business from these apps. You should always have your shop, address and business phone number in your socials. 

Replying to inquiries should be a priority too. When I see tattooers post stuff like “I’ll get back to all messages this weekend”.. you had time to make that post, but not get back to someone asking for a tattoo? I’ve had months where I had every week booked full with appointments and never felt the need to make a post like this. I get back to everyone as soon as I can. You’re staring at your phone 8 hours a day probably, you’ve got the time and you don’t need to wait til the weekend. Bonus points if you post “NO DMs” or memes about being exhausted by customers asking about tattoos at the bar or whatever. Just makes you seem unapproachable and not receptive. You should be grateful for any opportunity you get to sell a tattoo and book an appointment. I’ve gotten customers all over the place cause I’m down to talk tats all day every day with anyone anywhere I go. I’m also pretty introverted so it def takes effort but that potential client might lock in for a sleeve or back piece if you’re just friendly and receptive. 

Then we move on to the “appointment only” game. If you can swing that for your career, more power to you, but I was taught that shop min-$300 walk ins are the bread and butter of tattooing. I’ve had appointments no show me but I still got my daily bread taking walk ins. If you can’t handle the walk in hustle tattooing probably isn’t a suitable career for you. Lots of tattoo customers are impulsive people. They wake up and have no plans on a day off, they’re out and about, walk by a tattoo shop and say “fuck it todays the day” if you think you’re too good for infinite symbols (aka you hate money), don’t take walk ins I guess. 

Then there’s “IM AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR I DONT HAVE TO BABYSIT YOUR SHOP”. Yes, you’re right, but how do you expect to make money if you’re not at work?

If you can’t bother to hang at your shop and fish for walk ins, you’re going hungry no matter what. Yeah $0 days happen and it sucks but what can you do but try again tomorrow, at least you painted a sheet full of new designs to sell!

**5.) location location location**

We all like to pretend a studios reputation is its end all be all, and reputation is a big factor, but it’s not everything. Lots of shops are successful simply due to being in a good location. Shop visibility, strong market for tattoo customers (military base, college, young people, tourism) etc.. I’d say mostof the walk ins I tattoo don’t even ask to look at a portfolio. Their tattoo is “simple” and they believe that any tattooer working in a shop can make it. It’s not like they’re asking for a tattoo of da vinci’s last supper or something. The only reason they’re in your shop is cause they saw the “tattoo” sign from the bar across the street. 

This being said, a bad location can turn a tattoo shop to dust especially a walk in / street shop. Sometimes there’s too many shops in town. Too many mouths to feed in your shop with too little business.. artists get resentful and it turns into a soap opera and finger pointing. Reality is, location just sucks. If your shop doesn’t get any walk ins I’d pack up and go wherever the walk ins are. Simple as that. If a tattoo shop is in a walkable retail/shopping area near college and military, then there’s probably walk ins to be tattooed. 

6.) Don’t work for predators and exploitative shop owners / avoid or leave shops with poor reputation.

This one is majorly important if you wanna survive tattooing. Absolutely fuck these shitty shop owners. I’ve worked for owners who hire guys who have a rep for being a sexual predator to clients, loud and proud neo nazis, guys who get violent with coworkers, etc.. all out of greed. 

Shop owners who put their head in the sand and knowingly bring on weirdos, creeps, or thieves to stick around purely to line their pockets while offering no marketing.  Further diluting the walk in clientele pool with tattooers that ensure clients will not return. 

Which brings me to another point-shop owners who are low effort- providing nothing but space and basic utilities / amenities required by the health dept. They might make a half ass social media post once a month- poorly designed with misspelled words. Not receptive to any ideas to generate business for the studio. They’d rather fart in their chair all day than do something to keep their team busy and it’s everyone else’s fault. I guarantee you there’s  definitely no one watching the counter or answering  phones. 

I spent the first 5 years of my career working in places like this and they’re always run by a piece of shit who can only keep low skill desperate little goon artists working for them. You’ve probably seen these shops posting “NOW HIRING !!1!”” Every 3 months on IG. As soon as the booth is full it’s radio silent again til the next artist leaves cause it’s degenerating into a scratcher factory.

**7.) show up to the shop. draw and paint every day when not tattooing, need a break from drawing? Focus on other aspects of your business**

Show up. I’m in the shop every day we’re open whether I have an appointment or not. Always trying to get here at least an hour early. Tattooing is an entrepreneurial endeavor. When business is slow I’m painting, working on my social media stuff, reaching back to clients about tattoo inquiries etc. Clients love to see art being made in progress. They feel like they’re in a real tattoo shop. It shows you’re a real artist and not the 1 of a million copying lame Pinterest clip art. When I first came into a tattoo shop I loved that all of the flash was actually hand painted by the artists working there. 

If you’re in the habit of showing up whenever you want, 2 hours late, never paint / post flash, leaving early, oh I don’t have any appointments today I’m gonna go ride my motorcycle, you’re missing potential lifelong clients. 

If you work at a walk in studio, customers get pissed and will never come to your shop again if you’re not there during it’s listed hours of operation. if some are spiteful enough they’ll 1 star you, and you deserve it! It’s frustrating if you’re trying to get some kind or service, google says the business is open and you make the drive just to see the closed sign and the door locked. Yes even if you’re only leaving 15 minutes early. I’ve done so many walk in tattoos for people 10 min before close. Sometimes they’re super thankful, tip well and they’ll be back. 

**8.) budget and save**

Years before my career when I started painting tattoo flash. I’d hangout at a cool traditional shop in my town.. just get feedback on my work, get tattooed, shoot the shit. One piece of wisdom the head artist of the shop granted me was “always remember November and December”. 

Stash your acorns away folks.. November and December is always slow. Thanksgiving, Christmas, travel plans, cold weather, snow.. kinda jams up the operation and makes you wish you didn’t buy that motorcycle or go on that expensive international vacation after the busy season. 

You’ve gotta have some self control with your money and don’t be stupid. It’s easy to not give a fuck and “treat yo self” when you tattooed all day and have a band of cash in your pocket, but in December that might be all you make for like 2 weeks. Set aside what’s needed for taxes, have an emergency fund and save save save. Hate to sound like a boomer here but ditch the $7 fancy iced lattes and $20+ lunches. Bring lunch to work  and coffee from home or coffee pot at the shop will save you at least like $2400 a year. That’s your rent/utilities for December. Dave Ramsay’s YT channel is a good listen for anyone trying to get better in their relationship with money. 

Also, invest your money. Have your money work for you. But also diversify.. crypto has potential but is also volatile as fuck, index funds are safe slow growth, Roth IRA for retirement etc... I like to keep a few thousand in cash in a fire proof safe for a SHTF fund too.. at least 2 months rent and living expenses. As we all know “independent contractors” can be thrown out on the street at the drop of a hat for no reason and now you have to move shops and rebuild clientele. It’s happened to lots of us, but that’s the pirate life of a tattooer. 

**9.) take your vacation time during thanksgiving / Christmas time**

Like I said in the last point.. November and December is the most dead time for tattooing. If you’ve got time booked in, expect cancellations. Why not take advantage of it and treat yourself to a vacation or stay home and have some extra time with friends and family. I’m guessing most of us can’t even afford that in this economy, but if you’re gonna travel or take some time for RnR, November and December is the time. Do it in the busy season and you’re missing out on making serious dough. 

If you have a psycho boss who doesn’t let you take time off, or you work at a shitty shop you’re kinda over. Now could be the time to put your feelers out and see if other shops need someone. It’s also a good time to pack your shit over night and leave the key in the mailbox if it’s not working out. No business coming in anyway. If your boss sucks I give you full permission to ghost. Fuck this 2 weeks thank you handshake shit.. if they’re fucking you over one way or another and a shitty lazy shop owner they don’t deserve respect. Make it known. They’re gonna tell everyone you were falling asleep tattooing while high on heroin anyway. 

**10.) stay inspired / reject the grumpy jaded “tattooing sucks now” attitude**

Keep your head above this bullshit. I know every old head likes to lament about tattooing being a bloated corpse, how it’s not cool anymore or how the golden age was the 90s. iPad kids this dildo pens that.. Fuck all that shit. 

I find that every tattooer I hear say this, they’re doing the same old boring mediocre shit tracing old Bowery flash and repeating the same ol’ we’ve seen forever. If you ask me that’s no different than the fineline salon tattooers tracing Pinterest crap on their iPad. Do you want a gold star cause you used tracing paper and a light table?

Reality is, I believe tattooing is actually in a renaissance of sorts. It’s more popular than ever, I see an endless amount of super talented artists today really innovating and pushing boundaries. The “LETS SEE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WHEN ITS HEALED UP 10 YEARS” crowd is just insecure bullshit. Ever see a “traditional tattoo” healed 30+ years? They all eventually morph into abstract art. More or less depending on how it was applied and how the client takes care of themselves. 

Tattooing is over saturated with TALENT right now. A lot of the ones whining about over-saturation simply aren’t keeping up with tattooing’s evolution. Also- the reason why this over-saturation is a problem in the first place is the overly greedy shop owners.. apprentice mills, etc.. If these studios weren’t greedy as hell you wouldn’t see several tattoo shops pop up down the street every few years. I’ve heard tattooers say the industry is “over saturated since I first had interest in becoming a tattooer back in 2006. 

These are my 10 points for tattoo artists everywhere to stay afloat. I’ve somehow managed to make tattooing my full time job without any need for a side hustle for the last 7 years (after apprenticing 2 and 4 years of art college prior). Tattooing supports my family and keeps a roof over our heads. Hopefully this read was fun and somewhat informative beyond the obvious. I can’t stand the catty “go ahead and quit tattooing doesn’t need you!” Shit and wanted to lay down some pointers that might help some folks. I’d like to see everyone who wants it succeed, but not all will cause most probably shouldn’t have been let in to begin with. Peace and love y’all. ",12,1766102158.0,TattooArtists,4,0.88,False

*Part 4: Like hugging an old friend*

*Sunlight spilled unevenly through the cracks in the shrubbery outside my window; warm patterns were scattered on the floor and dust motes danced lazily through them. I stretched out on my bed, limbs long and still sticky from sleep; and yawned slowly, making sure I got every bit of it out, sound echoed softly against the walls.* 

*Today, there was no barn to clean, no chores to attend, no schedule to obey. Just me, the woods, and a whole day to wander. It had been a few weeks since my last “experience” and I had grown to miss my space despite our rough night. With a speed reserved only for the weekends I pulled on my favorite worn sneakers; the ones with laces fraying at the ends and “SUZ” written on the tips; and padded into the kitchen. The house still smelled faintly of coffee and clean dish soap, my fathers doing, remnants of a man already hard at work. I moved quietly, not because I had to, but because mornings like this felt delicate, like they could be startled if you rushed them.* 

*From the refrigerator I gathered what I wanted with care: a small wedge of cheese wrapped in wax paper, pale and cool against the palm; a handful of crackers slid delicately out of a decorated tin, their edges already dusted with salt and their structures weak; a little carton of berries, some bruised, some perfect, smelling sweet and green all at once. I rinsed them gently in the sink, watching droplets cling and fall, my fingers turning red from the cold water.* 

*I packed everything neatly, like I was building a promise for later. The notebook went in first, its pages still mostly blank; followed by a book i was hoping to finally reach the end of today; then a small thermos of water, cool to the touch; The food followed, tucked in snug so it wouldn’t rattle; and finally a plaid blanket came last, folded carefully, corners aligned just right. The weight of the backpack felt right when I lifted it onto my shoulders; not heavy, just full. The kind of fullness that made me feel prepared, even excited.*

*“Bye Dad, I love you!” I called as I stepped out the door.* 

*The air was sharp, fresh after the week’s lingering drizzle. He looked up from where he was fixing the hinges on the chicken coop, wiping his hands on a rag.* 

*“Have fun, kiddo. Don’t wander too far,” he said, voice warm beneath the habitual weariness.* 

*“I won’t,” I hastily promised, still meaning it. Adding quietly, “Thanks for letting me go.” as I crossed the yard.*

*He gave me a brief smile and just like that, the interaction was done. My father was soon out of sight but he lingered in my chest; a soft tether that made me feel safe while setting out into the forest.* 

*The woods met me like an old friend! Leaves whispered against one another, brushing soft patterns of shadow on the damp earth. Moss clung to roots like old velvet upholstery and the trunks of the trees stood firm and tall, their branches interlacing to form the faintest latticework of overhead green surrounding me in a way that felt more like hug than containment. Birds sang songs back and forth to each other, a distant raucous chorus that warmed my heart. I could almost feel the forest breathe, expanding with her every step.* 

*But as time passed and I followed familiar paths, the magic usually found here seemed muted. Every turn was… familiar; every hollow and every bend already claimed by a memory. The undergrowth that usually offered small surprises; a familial mushroom cluster, a pool where sunlight made the water glow gold, a beetle making a home for itself; now kept its secrets to itself. It was as if the forest had its attention elsewhere, leaving me to wander its edges like a guest whose visit had been anticipated but overlooked.* 

*My dad's old boots sank slightly into the mossy ground, leaving delicate impressions that the forest would soon erase. The air smelled faintly of rain-damp wood and something richer beneath, an earthiness that spoke of life hidden just out of sight. I finally paused by a familiar oak, running a finger over the rough bark, tracing the grooves that seemed like veins for the tree itself; i let my love travel through my fingertips. It didn’t respond, of course, but I imagined it watching, silently enjoying the time we were having. As I walked, a wind picked up in scattered gusts, stirring the leaves but leaving the branches unnaturally still in some places. I noticed this but didn't want to ruin the relationship I'd repaired with these woods; I tilted my head listening for any shifts, squinted my eyes to see any lurking creatures, and took in the energy of this space. Ultimately it didn't feel like there was a threat here, not yet, just the sense of a world operating on frequencies I couldn’t predict. The forest had shifted subtly in my absence and though I had always loved its familiar shapes and sounds, today they seemed slightly… rehearsed. Like there was something wrong backstage and the actors were trying to stall for time.* 

*Finally around mid-day I found my usual clearing by the stream, a place where wildflowers poked their heads through the grass, the current moved gentle and clear over smooth stones, and the sunlight touched the water in glimmers that made the surface seem to breathe. I spread the patterned blanket with care, smoothing out the creases so that the plaid lay even, and arranged my books, snacks, and thermos around me. Once everything was perfect I settled down with a sigh and opened my book.* 

*The words began to pull me in, I had left off in the middle of a declaration of love and every proclamation brought on a new emotion, I was obsessed. I read for a good while, but eventually my eyes kept wandering to the edges of the clearing, where the forest seemed to lean just a little closer than usual. I would hear a branch creak somewhere deeper in the woods, a bird cry that lingered too long, the faint hiss of water over stones. Nothing alarming, nothing tangible, yet the hairs on my arms lifted in tiny spikes every time.* 

*The sun shifted higher, warming my skin just enough through the gaps in the trees, the forest seemed calm and almost obliged my request of peace. I took a sip from my thermos, the water cold and crisp; and chewed slowly on the sweet berries and creamy cheese; savoring the mundane comfort of flavors I knew so well. I closed my eyes for a moment, letting the warmth of the sun sink down to my bones. I imagined myself as a part of the forest, a small figure woven into the tapestry of earth and wood; and for a brief while, everything felt as it always should've; alive, patient, and endless. I leaned back on the blanket, letting my head rest against the soft folds of fabric. The day stretched before me, golden and promising, and for this morning at least, the world seemed gentle…………*

*…………I must have drifted off without noticing.* 

*One moment I was reading the same paragraph for the third time, the river whispering over stones beside me, the grass tickling my arms softly; and the next my eyes were heavy in a way that felt earned. The book rest closed against my chest, sunlight warmed my face in soft pulses as leaves shifted overhead, and I remember thinking that the forest had finally decided to keep me company again.*

*When I woke, it was not with a start but it was quiet in that strange way that only happens when nothing is wrong yet but is expected to be. The light had shifted; afternoon now, slanted and more yellow than white. My blanket was rumpled beneath me, the grass pressed flat where I’d slept. For a moment I lay still, listening to the river, counting my breaths, trying to place the small wrongness I felt humming just under my skin.*

*Then I saw the crack.*

*It ran through the earth beside my blanket in a thin pencil line, starting near my elbow and disappearing beneath the grass. At first I thought it must have been there already, something I’d missed while setting up. The ground dries and splits sometimes but with the recent rains this didn’t seem like the answer. Sometimes animals burrowed through but this was too smooth to be one of their simple doings. I sat up and leaned closer, brushing aside a few blades of grass to see where it went.*

*The soil around it was cleanly parted, not crumbled. The line was sharp, deliberate, like it had been drawn rather than broken. I traced it with my finger, feeling the cool edges of dirt give just slightly beneath my touch. It was oddly satisfying, like the way puzzle pieces meet. The crack widened a hair as I pressed, not resisting, not welcoming… just responding.*

*“Huh,” I murmured, more curious than alarmed.*

*I followed it on my hands and knees for a foot or two, It curved gently with the terrain, not random in the slightest. The earth felt warmer here though the air hadn’t changed a degree. I pressed my palm flat against the ground and held it there, waiting to see if it would pulse or shift or do something dramatic.*

*Instead, it seeped.*

*At first I thought it was shadow; darkness gathering in the seam where the light couldn’t quite reach… then the shadow moved. A thick, glossy blackness welled up from the crack, slow and unhurried, like syrup poured from an unseen underground bottle. It coated the edges of the soil, swallowing the brown and turning it into a reflective muck, this was wrong. The smell reached me a second later; sharp, chemical, nothing like the forest it was coming from. It burned faintly at the back of my throat. I pulled my hand back too late, the substance clung to my fingertips, heavier than it should have been, catching the light in a way that resembled dark red blood that made my stomach drop. I wiped it against the grass instinctively, but the grass only bent beneath it, darkened, slicked over.*

*“What is that…?” I whispered.*

*The fear I’d been searching for since waking up arrived then, sudden and cold, flooding in where curiosity had occupied just moments ago. The ground continued to ooze. My heart thudded hard against my ribs, threatening to escape my body. I scrambled backward, nearly tangling myself in the blanket, eyes locked on the crack as more of the shit pushed up through it, patient and steady, purposeful. The line in the ground widened with a soft, wet sound, the earth parting like it had been waiting for permission.*

*I was still staring at the ground when the sound came.*

*A deep, distant boom rolled through the dirt beneath me and made my ears ring; it was not from the forest, not from the sky, but from far below. The earth shuddered, just once, enough to rattle my teeth and send ripples across the surface of the stream. I froze, breath caught in my chest, the growing black puddle gleaming beside me as the sound echoed on and on.*

*I didn’t wait another second, throwing everything loosely in my pack and sprinting through the forest. Branches scraped my face, roots snagged at my shoes, and my backpack bounced heavy against my spine. New cracks were forming on the ground around me and puddles of this dark substance began to cover the forest floor. The familiar friendly feeling I'd had was gone now, so was the sinister one the forest was able to carry at times; there was simply nothing here.*

*I heard my father’s voice before I even saw our property.*

*“SUZANNAH! SUZANNAH PLEASE!” he yelled with authority covering his fear.*

*I broke through the treeline at a full sprint, only slowing down so as to not run through dad. The weight of his world lifted off his shoulders when he saw me running across the yard, he caught me in a tight hug and I cried into his chest, full body sobs shook the both of us and at one point I wasn't sure who was causing them. We held each other until both of our senses snapped back into place.*

*“What happened out there baby, are you okay?”*

 *I swallowed hard, words crowding my mouth and refusing to fall in line.*

*“Baby breathe, it's okay, what happened?”*

*“I was by the river,” I said finally. “Just reading… I fell asleep for a little while.”*

*I shook my head, already doubting myself.*

*“When I woke up the air was… different. Like it decided to do something while I wasn’t looking. The ground was…”*

*My hands curled in his shirt, knuckles white.*

*“Wrong… There was a line in the dirt. No, a crack. But it looked like a line; like someone had drawn it.”*

*I hesitated, searching his face to see if this sounded as wrong out loud as it felt in my body.*

*“I touched it,” I admitted. “Only a little bit! Then it moved! Like it knew I was there…”*

*My voice dropped without me meaning it to.*

*“Then something came up through it. Not water. Not mud. It was black and thick and it smelled like it didn’t belong out there.”*

*I shook my head again, faster now.*

*“It wasn’t spilling up. It was… climbing, wanting me.”*

*I looked back toward the woods, even though they were hidden behind the house now.*

*“And then the ground made a sound. From underneath. Like something big shifted over.”*

*I pressed my forehead into his chest, breath hitching.*

*“What’s happening dad, what did I do?” I whispered.*

*With those last words my dad kissed my forehead and wiped the tears from my cheeks.*

 *“You didn’t do anything baby, I don’t know what that was but I promise it wasn’t you… I’m gonna run into town and see what happened, see if everyone’s alright… I need you to stay her—”*

 *“WHAT?!” I screamed.*

*The word tore out of me before I could soften it. My throat burned immediately after, like my body was punishing me for being loud.*

*“No,” I said, shaking my head hard. “No, you can’t just— you can’t leave me here. You heard me, right? You heard what I said.”*

*“I did,” he said quickly. Too quickly to seem like he was truly considering it. He put his hands on my shoulders like he could anchor me in place. “That’s exactly why-”*

*“Then take me with you!” My voice cracked, splintering down the middle, stinging my throat again. “Please. I’ll sit in the truck, I won’t say anything, I won’t touch anything, I just— I don’t wanna be here by myself.”*

*He looked past me, just for a second, toward the road running along our property. I looked past him, toward the woods that had raised me and then loudly abandoned me. When his eyes came back to mine, they were wet in a way that scared me worse than anything I’d described.*

*“Suzannah,” he said, using my full name like he was bracing himself. “If something’s wrong… if it’s not just an earthquake or a busted pipe or some idiot’s equipment… then town’s the worst place for you to be, that shit is seeping up in the fields too, I gotta find out what's going on.”*

*“You don’t know that,” I said. “You don’t—”*

*“I know you’re safe here,” he snapped, then immediately softened, like he hated himself for it. “I know this land. I know this house. And I know I can’t keep you safe if I don’t know what’s happening yet.”*

*I choked on my tears. “What difference will it make if you’re out there or here, like you said YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING!”*

*“I know baby, but I need to see so I know what to do for us.”*

*The realization landed heavy between us.*

*He stepped back, already reaching for his keys like the decision had been made somewhere inside him before he’d even opened his mouth. Panic surged up my spine.*

*“Dad,” I said, grabbing his sleeve. “Please don’t go. Please don’t leave me. Please I love you”*

*He stalled for a moment, I thought I’d won.*

*Then he turned and pulled me into another hug, tighter than before, like he was trying to memorize the shape of me.*

*“You listen to me,” he said into my hair. His voice shook now, no authority left to hide behind. “You lock the doors. You don’t go back into the woods. You don’t answer for anyone but me. I’ll be back before dark.”*

*Before dark…*

*The promise felt fragile, like glass.*

*“I don’t like this,” I whispered.*

*“I know,” he said. “I don’t either.”*

*He pulled away, already moving, already halfway gone. I stood frozen in the yard as he climbed into the truck, the engine roared to life too loud in the sudden stillness. Gravel sprayed as he turned around, not looking back this time because if he did, I think he might not have been able to leave.*

*The truck disappeared down the drive and the quiet rushed in to fill the space it had left behind.*

*I stood there alone, staring at my dark stained hands, the house looming at my back, the woods watching from an indifferent distance they hadn’t kept before; and for the first time all day I understood something clearly and without wonder, whatever was happening out there had already been set into motion.*

*Eventually, I went inside and locked the door behind me, the click of the deadbolt sounding final in a way it never had before. The house smelled like dust, warm wood, and the faint ghost of lunch. It was the same house I’d grown up in, every corner familiar enough that I could walk it blind, but now it felt… staged. Like a place pretending to be itself.*

*I checked the windows like he’d asked. All of them. The kitchen first, then the living room, then my bedroom. I pulled the curtains tight on all of them even though it was still daylight.* 

*I settled in the living room, curled up on the couch with my knees pulled tight to my chest. The cushions still held the shape of him from last night. I pressed my hand into the fabric, grounding myself in it, like it could stand in for his presence if I tried hard enough.*

*I tried to think of him the way I always did: steady hands, quiet mornings, the way he fixed things even when they didn’t really need fixing. The way he never said I love you much, but always made sure I came first above all else. I wondered if he knew how much I noticed.*

*The clock on the wall ticked. Each second felt deliberately slow. I counted them for a while but stopped when I realized I’d skipped one and panicked, convinced something had happened in that missing moment.*

*I hugged my arms tighter around myself.*

*I loved my dad in a way that felt bigger than my body, like if I let it expand fully it would tear me open. He was my constant. My proof that the world could be rough and still kind. That you could live in a small place and make it enough just by virtue of being.*

*The idea of something taking him, of the world deciding it needed him more than I did, made my chest ache so badly I had to breathe through it. I told myself he’d come back. He always did.*

*The house creaked as the minutes dragged; the air cooled in long settling sighs. I flinched constantly, every sound felt charged now and every shift of air was a question I didn’t want to answer. I listened hard, straining for the familiar rumble of his truck, for anything that meant I wasn’t alone in this anymore…Nothing came.*

*Outside, the light began to tilt, shadows stretching across the floor in slow, careful lines. I thought the afternoon had slipped toward evening without asking my permission. I watched it happen from the couch, afraid that if I looked away the world would move faster and leave me behind.*

*I stayed exactly where I was. Waiting…*

*At first, I thought it was rain. A sound, it started as a soft irregular tapping somewhere above me. Not loud enough to be urgent, not steady enough to demand attention. Just a sound you notice after it’s already been happening for a while.* 

*Drip.* 

*Pause.* 

*Drip-drip.* 

*Another pause.*

*I lifted my head from the couch and listened. The house answered back with its usual noises; wood shifting, the refrigerator humming, the clock insisting on its rhythm; but threaded through it all was that sound. Wet. Patient. Inevitable.*

*Drip.*

*My first thought was the roof. Dad had patched it last spring but storms had a way of undoing hard work. I stood, moving cautiously, like if I startled the house it might expose something worse. The sound seemed louder near the kitchen so I followed it there, bare feet whispering against the tile. I had only taken a few steps when I stopped in my tracks. Right in front of me, the window over the sink was streaked with something dark; I stared in quiet horror.*

*Through the streaks, outside, the sky had gone a dull sickly gray; not storm gray, not rain gray, but flat and heavy, like it had been scrubbed of depth and made into one. Falling from it, slowly, were thick drops of black muck.*

*They didn’t splash the way rain should. They landed heavy and sticky. Each drop pulled itself downward in a long string before snapping free, striking the roof, the yard, the fence with a soft, obscene plop.*

*This was the same substance as before, the same one that had seeped from a crack in the earth and it was falling from cracks in the sky; with a somewhat level head I could clearly identify it now; Oil.*

*My stomach dropped so hard I thought I might be sick.*

*“No,” I whispered, losing my stillness and pressing my hand to the glass. “No, no-”*

*Another drop slid down the windowpane, dragging a long shimmering smear behind it. It caught the light wrong, reflecting red and purple across my kitchen making it look like a crime scene. The smell reached me even through the closed window; sharp, chemical, burned, familiar.* 

*The dripping sped up.*

*What had been pauses between drops became a steady rhythm. First one drip. Then two. Then a sequence. Then it was steady. Then it got faster. Soon the sounds were all overlapping and the roof began to thud under the weight of it, the sound was dull and wet and entirely wrong. I watched in horror as the yard darkened, grass bending under the slick coating, flowers disappearing beneath black shine. Something struck the porch roof with enough force to make the house shudder.*

*I yelped and stumbled backward as a glob slid down our gutter and hit the porch steps below, spreading outward like it was alive. The sky above seemed to sag, thickening, unable to hold the weight, the oil falling in ropes now instead of beads.*

*My heart slammed against my ribs.*

*“Dad,” I hitched, calling out again before remembering he wasn’t there. My hands shook uselessly at my sides. The house groaned again, a deeper sound this time, like it was protesting the weight of what was being asked of it.*

*Another heavy impact. Then another.*

*Something cracked, wood or glass or something else unseen. I backed away from the window, panic finally breaking loose from wherever I’d been keeping it caged. The house wasn’t safe; I could feel that now, deep in my gut. Whatever was happening wasn’t stopping at the trees. It wasn’t stopping at the fields. It had found us. It had found me. My body betrayed me, a dark wetness spread across my jeans and I couldn’t stop it. The shame hit fast but was quickly beaten out of my head by the fear, all encompassing. I grabbed my backpack from where it still leaned against the couch, slinging it over my shoulder with hands that barely listened to me. Oil hammered the roof now, fast and relentless, the sound rising to a horrible, drowning roar. Somewhere above, something gave way with a sharp crack and a wet slap.*

*I didn’t wait to see what it was.*

*I yanked the door open and ran, the smell hitting me full-force as I burst outside, oil-slicked air burning my lungs, and an oppressive black shroud encompassed me. Behind me, the house creaked and groaned under the oil rain, another place that had always kept me safe now bowing beneath something far older and heavier than it had ever known.*

*I didn’t look back.*",1,1766102103.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

After that painful conversation, I did what I said I would. I stepped back. I stopped being the first one to call, stopped offering to help with every little thing, stopped being the emotional safety net I'd always been. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but I meant what I said about directing my energy toward people who value it.

For the first couple of months, we barely spoke. She didn't reach out, and I didn't either. My wife was caught in the middle, which I hated, but she understood where I was coming from even if it was hard for her too.

Then, about six weeks ago, my stepdaughter called me. 

She was crying. She said she'd been doing a lot of thinking and had gone back to therapy on her own. She told me that after our argument, she'd actually had more contact with her biological father than usual, and it had forced her to confront some hard truths. Apparently, he'd already started flaking again, missing calls, making excuses. The pattern she'd spent her whole childhood excusing was playing out in real time, and she couldn't unsee it anymore.  
  
She apologized. Not a surface-level apology, but a real one. She acknowledged that what she said to me was cruel and untrue. She told me she knows I'm her father in every way that matters and that she was so afraid of admitting her biological dad would never be what she needed that she took it out on me instead. She said the wedding decision was her trying to ""fix"" something. 

I won't pretend that conversation erased everything. It didn't. Those words, ""You aren't my father,"" still echo sometimes. But I also know that healing isn't linear, and neither is forgiveness.

We've been slowly rebuilding. We grab coffee every week now. She's asked for my advice on a few things, and I've given it. I'm not back to being her around-the-clock handyman and emergency fund, and honestly, I don't think I should be. That dynamic wasn't healthy for either of us.

What I've realised through all of this is that my stepping back wasn't just about protecting myself. It gave her the space to actually miss what we had and to see her biological father clearly for maybe the first time. I couldn't have forced that clarity on her. She had to find it herself.

I'm still grieving a little. The version of our relationship I thought we had is gone. But what we're building now feels more honest. She's seeing me as a person with feelings, not just a constant she could take for granted. And I'm learning to love her without losing myself in the process.

To anyone in a similar situation: sometimes the most loving thing you can do is step back and let someone experience the consequences of their choices. It doesn't mean you stop caring. It means you start caring about yourself too.",9,1766102040.0,blendedfamilies,4,0.8,False

The mountain road rises in long, winding stretches that lift the car through dense pine forest. Light filters through the branches in thin strips, flickering across the windshield. The air outside grows colder with each turn, collecting faintly against the glass. High above the ridge, the sky settles into a gray-blue tone that hints at rain later in the night.

Emily rests her temple against the passenger window. The cool surface grounds her. The trees pass in a gentle blur, tall and silent, making her feel as though the world has slowed down just enough for her to breathe again.

Renee glances at her daughter.

“You holding up,” she asks.

Emily smirks.

“Barely,” she says. “Your driving is very offensive to my nervous system.”

Renee breathed out her nose quickly and smiled.

“I had one speeding ticket in my entire life,” she says. “Nineteen ninety-six. A historical event.”

Emily finally lifts her head.

“That is what someone with a secret second ticket would say.”

Renee raises an eyebrow.

“If I had more tickets, they would involve something dramatic. Maybe a helicopter.”

Emily laughs softly. The sound startles her a little. She feels Renee glance at her again.

“Dad would tease you forever,” Emily says. “He would call this our grief retreat.”

Renee smiles, the kind of smile that relaxes and hurts at the same time.

“He would,” she says quietly.

They let the silence stretch. They have been carrying silence for months. Hospitals. Machines. The final stretch of days where everything felt paused. Now they are here, climbing a mountain because the house felt too heavy to stay inside any longer.

Renee nudges her gently.

“You are allowed to laugh,” she says.

Emily nods.

“I am trying.”

“So am I,” Renee replies.

The trees open just long enough to reveal a wooden sign ahead.

CAMP RIDGE LINE

Renee exhales.

“There it is,” she says. “And only one wrong turn.”

“Two,” Emily corrects.

“One.”

“Mom,” Emily says, “you circled the gas station twice.”

“I was evaluating my options,” Renee replies.

“You were lost.”

Renee shakes her head and smiles.

She turns into the gravel entrance. The tires crunch over loose stone. A small office building sits off to the left, with rocking chairs lined under the porch roof and a bulletin board displayed behind cloudy plastic.

A man in a dark green jacket walks beside the building, carrying a trash bag toward a large bin. He is thin and slightly hunched, moving with quiet precision. His expression is neutral, almost blank, the way someone looks after a long day of repetitive work. When he notices their car, he gives a brief, polite nod.

Emily lifts her fingers to wave. Renee returns the nod and continues down the road.

“Camp maintenance,” Renee says. “Or the custodian.”

Emily watches the man until the car moves past.

“He seemed nice,” she says.

“Or shy,” Renee replies. “Or avoiding us. Hard to say.”

They continue through the inner loop of the campground. Wooden posts with numbers mark the sites. Many are empty. A few campers pack up hurriedly, tossing folded tents and coolers into vehicles before driving off. The place has been draining of people since the sun began lowering.

Emily notices them disappearing.

“This place feels emptier than I expected,” she says.

“Probably just the weather,” Renee says. “Rain scares people who like comfort.”

Emily smirks.

“You like comfort.”

“I love comfort,” Renee says.

They reach Lot 23. Renee parks the car in the clearing and shuts off the engine. The quiet that follows is deep and immediate.

Emily steps out. The air is crisp and clean, filled with the scent of pine needles and cold soil. She inhales slowly.

“It is nice,” she says.

Renee steps beside her.

“It is peaceful,” she says. “We needed peaceful.”

She reaches over and straightens Emily’s hood.

“No casserole dishes. No ringing phones. No well-meaning neighbors with sympathy cards shaped like flowers.”

Emily makes a face.

“I swear, if someone brings one more tuna casserole…”

“I will bury it in the yard,” Renee says.

Emily laughs. For a second, grief loosens.

They begin unloading. Emily takes the tent bag and chairs while Renee sets down the tarp and cooking bin. They carry everything to the flattest part of the site.

Footsteps crunch behind them.

The campsite worker approaches with a mesh bag of firewood. He stops at a comfortable distance.

“Evening,” he says quietly. “Just checking on new arrivals.”

His voice is soft, cautious.

Renee smiles.

“Thanks,” she says. “Everything looks good.”

“The office is open until sundown,” he replies. “If you need anything.”

Emily nods.

“Thank you.”

He gives a short nod and continues down the loop, disappearing behind a curve.

Renee watches him go.

“He seems gentle,” she says.

“Or allergic to talking,” Emily adds.

“Relatable,” Renee whispers.

They get back to the tent. Emily spreads the fabric. Renee begins threading the poles. They work in a steady rhythm until Renee lifts one of the longer poles to form the first arch.

A sharp crack echoes across the clearing.

Emily jumps.

The pole has snapped cleanly in the middle.

“Oh come on,” Renee mutters.

Emily crouches beside her.

“We cannot fix that,” she says. “We should go ask the campsite guy. He probably knows how to deal with this.”

Renee pauses.

“What was his name,” Emily asks. “Did he tell us?”

“No,” Renee says. “I do not remember. I think he had a name tag on his jacket but i was too busy not paying attention.”

Emily nods slowly.

“He probably has real tools. Maybe a spare tent. tape?”

Renee lifts the broken pole and looks at the sky growing dimmer.

“Let us try to fix it ourselves first,” she says. “If it collapses, we can blame the maintenance guy for not magically appearing. Besides, I have tape. Is it strong tape? We’ll find out but i will be using the whole roll.”

Emily laughs.

“Deal.”

They brace the broken pieces and wrap them in several layers of tape. When they lift the structure, the tent rises crooked but stands firm enough for the night.

“It has personality,” Emily says.

Renee groans.

“It really does.”

They finish setting up camp. Chairs unfold near the fire ring. The lantern is hung from a low branch. The stove sits on steady ground.

The campground grows quiet. A few remaining campers leave. A single lantern flickers in the distance, then disappears.

They cook a simple dinner. They eat slowly, talking about small, safe things. Movies. Classes. Neighbors. Anything that is not grief. Anything that is not the vacancy waiting at home.

When the sky darkens fully, they climb into the tent. Emily zips the flap closed behind her. The air inside is cool but still.

“Mom,” Emily says softly.

“Yes,” Renee replies.

“I am glad we came,” Emily says. “Even for one night.”

Renee lies still for a moment.

“I am glad too,” she says. “I would not have wanted to be here by myself.”

Emily smiles in the dark.

Outside, the forest shifts. A breeze slides through the branches, leaves rustling. The night deepens.

CHAPTER TWO: The Call

The campground office sits quiet beneath the dim glow of a single porch light. The rocking chairs are empty. A moth taps against the glass door in slow, repeated motion, beating its wings in small dull flutters against the reflection.

Inside the office, the campground worker sits at a small desk with a stack of paperwork in front of him. Checklists of do’s, and more do’s to maintain campsite regulations. He is not really reading. His eyes drift over the forms without focus. The radio clipped to his belt crackles softly every few minutes, small bursts of static that fill the silence.

He rubs the bridge of his nose. The long day has left an ache behind his eyes. He had cleaned the bathhouse, hauled trash, restocked firewood, and walked every loop twice. He does not complain. This kind of work suits him. Predictable. Quiet. Nothing unexpected.

He reaches for the half cup of coffee he had forgotten about earlier. Even though it’s cold now, he drinks it anyway.

The radio on his belt finally crackles with clarity.

Dispatch voice:
“Ridge Line maintenance, do you copy.”

He picks up the radio and presses the button.

“Copy.”

“Got a call from the county line,” the voice replies. “Someone reported a truck broken down on the mountain pass. Caller could not stay. Vehicle description is white. Possibly empty. Should be a half mile from your entrance.”

He sits up a little straighter.

“Is it blocking the road,” he asks.

“Unknown. Caller said it looked abandoned. You close enough to check?”

He nods, even though they cannot see him.

“On my way.”

“Keep your radio on. Signal gets weak near the bend.”

He clips the radio back onto his belt, grabs his jacket, and steps outside. The cold greets him immediately. He pulls the zipper up to his chin. The sky has deepened into heavy winter-dark blue. The campground behind him is nearly silent. One lantern still flickers faintly at a distant site, but most tents, the few that remain, sit in darkness.

He begins walking toward the main road.

His boots crunch softly through the gravel. A breeze moves the branches above him, sending loose needles drifting to the ground. When he reaches the entrance, he pauses and looks back across the campground one last time.

The lot where the mother and daughter had set up is still and quiet. Their tent leans slightly, but their lantern is off.

He takes a breath and starts up the paved pass.

The mountain road is silent except for his footsteps and the occasional swell of wind rising from the valley. His flashlight beam tracks across the narrow asphalt, gliding over scattered stones and patches of frost.

Then he sees it.

A white pickup truck sits at the side of the road, angled slightly as if it rolled to a stop and remained there. The driver door is shut. No lights are on.

He slows.

“Dispatch, I have eyes on the vehicle,” he says into the radio. “White pickup. No one visible.”

Static. Then a faint reply.

“Copy. Please use caution, it is bear season.”

He moves to the driver-side window and cups a hand around his face to look inside. The cab is empty. No bags. No tools. No sign the driver left in a hurry, or in fear. Just emptiness.

“Vehicle is unoccupied,” he reports.

“Engine warm,” Dispatch asks.

He touches the hood. Cold.

“No. Has been here a while.”

He scans the ground with his flashlight. No tracks leading downhill toward the campground. But a thin dirt side road branches off nearby, faint and uneven. It is barely a road at all, more a forgotten maintenance trail leading deeper into the trees.

He raises the radio again.

“Looks like a secondary path here. Footprints going that direction possibly, it’s hard to tell. Could be the driver.”

Dispatch hesitates.

“Do not push too far. Sun is down.”

“I will walk a bit,” he says. “If they got lost, they might need help.”

“Keep the radio open.”

He turns onto the narrow dirt path. The forest closes in tighter around him. Branches strip the wind into small cold breaths. His flashlight moves across tangled roots and patches of old leaves.

The smell changes. Less pine. More damp rot. Something old and unused.

He walks another hundred yards.

Then the trees part.

A large shape rises ahead. An abandoned warehouse stands in the clearing, its metal siding streaked with rust and time. The building looks half-forgotten, a relic tucked away from the world. One of the large sliding doors is half open, leaving a black gap wide enough to slip through.

He lowers the radio.

“Dispatch,” he says, “I believe I found where the driver could’ve went. There is an old warehouse at the end of the path. Door is open. I will check inside.”

Static responds.

Then a faint voice.

“Copy that. Stay alert.”

He approaches the door.

The concrete threshold is stained. The metal edges are bent and misshapen from age. A faint smell drifts out. Metallic. Damp. Not quite definable.

He steps inside.

The beam of his flashlight cuts through the darkness. Dust floats through the air in slow drifting pieces. The warehouse is enormous inside, the ceiling nearly lost in the dark. Old machinery lines the walls. Some of it rusted. Some broken. Some covered in sheets of dust so thick it looks like ash.

The quiet is tight. Heavy. Listening.

He calls out.

“Hello. Anyone in here.”

His voice echoes back in long hollow layers.

He steps farther in.

“Sir. Ma’am. Your truck is on the road. I am here to help.”

Nothing.

He moves deeper, sliding the flashlight along the far wall. He passes several old workbenches, piles of debris, a long rusted track system that once carried crates or equipment.

His radio crackles on his belt.

“Status.”

He lifts it.

“In the warehouse. No sign of the driver yet.”

“Do not stay long.”

He lowers the radio.

Something shifts behind him.

A soft scrape. Barely audible.

He turns.

The flashlight beam sweeps across empty space.

His breath trembles.

He moves forward again, forcing himself to stay calm. He has been in old structures before. Animals nest in places like this. Wind rattles objects. Buildings breathe in strange ways.

But this feels different.

Wrong in a way he cannot name.

He approaches a long interior hallway branching off the main chamber. The walls here are concrete, smoother, colder. At the halfway point of the hall sits a large metal door.

It stands shut.

The same uneasy feeling curls up his spine.

He walks past it, not noticing he held his breath until his body forces him to take one again.

“Is anyone here,” he calls.

The answer comes without warning.

A rush of movement.

A force slamming into his back.

His flashlight hits the floor and spins wildly, throwing fractured beams of light across the walls. He stumbles hard, catching himself with a shout.

Hands grip his jacket.

Before he can react, he is lifted and slammed into the wall. The impact knocks the air from his lungs. He gasps, trying to understand what is happening.

He opens his mouth to speak, but a fist drives into his ribs. Then another. His knees buckle.

He cannot see the attacker well. Only the massive shape of a man, broad shouldered, towering. A dark outline against the faint light.

He tries to shout.

A hand clamps over his mouth.

A knife flashes.

The blade plunges into his abdomen. Once. Twice. A third time. He makes a sound he does not recognize as his own. His legs collapse beneath him.

He crawls.

Hands claw weakly at the floor.

The attacker follows.

His radio crackles frantically from his belt.

“Do you copy. Do you copy. We are losing your signal. Respond.”

He reaches for it, fingers shaking.

The large hand grabs the back of his jacket, hauling him backward. In a burst of desperate instinct, he unzips the jacket and wriggles out of it. The attacker stumbles as the empty jacket slips free, landing near the large metal door.

He scrambles to his feet and runs.

For a moment, he thinks he might reach the open warehouse entrance.

Then the attacker catches him.

A hand clamps around his throat and shoves him brutally against the floor. His vision spirals. The knife returns, stabbing downward again and again. His limbs weaken.

His radio shrieks with static.

“Maintenance. Come on, this isn’t funny now. This better not be another game you’re playing here, Mike. Answer. Are you alright.”

The attacker grabs the radio, raises it to his ear, and listens to the frantic voice.

He presses the button.

His breath fills the channel in a slow, steady rasp.

“We are fine,” he says.

Then he smashes the radio against the wall until the plastic breaks apart and the voice disappears.

He drags the dying man by the ankles back toward the large metal door. He hauls the body inside the dark room beyond it, disappears into the black, and slams the door shut with a metallic boom.

Silence returns.

Outside, in the campground far below, Emily and Renee sleep in their crooked tent without stirring.

The night deepens.

The mountain road rises in long, winding stretches that lift the car through dense pine forest. Light filters through the branches in thin strips, flickering across the windshield. The air outside grows colder with each turn, collecting faintly against the glass. High above the ridge, the sky settles into a gray-blue tone that hints at rain later in the night.

Emily rests her temple against the passenger window. The cool surface grounds her. The trees pass in a gentle blur, tall and silent, making her feel as though the world has slowed down just enough for her to breathe again.

Renee glances at her daughter.

“You holding up,” she asks.

Emily smirks.

“Barely,” she says. “Your driving is very offensive to my nervous system.”

Renee breathed out her nose quickly and smiled.

“I had one speeding ticket in my entire life,” she says. “Nineteen ninety-six. A historical event.”

Emily finally lifts her head.

“That is what someone with a secret second ticket would say.”

Renee raises an eyebrow.

“If I had more tickets, they would involve something dramatic. Maybe a helicopter.”

Emily laughs softly. The sound startles her a little. She feels Renee glance at her again.

“Dad would tease you forever,” Emily says. “He would call this our grief retreat.”

Renee smiles, the kind of smile that relaxes and hurts at the same time.

“He would,” she says quietly.

They let the silence stretch. They have been carrying silence for months. Hospitals. Machines. The final stretch of days where everything felt paused. Now they are here, climbing a mountain because the house felt too heavy to stay inside any longer.

Renee nudges her gently.

“You are allowed to laugh,” she says.

Emily nods.

“I am trying.”

“So am I,” Renee replies.

The trees open just long enough to reveal a wooden sign ahead.

CAMP RIDGE LINE

Renee exhales.

“There it is,” she says. “And only one wrong turn.”

“Two,” Emily corrects.

“One.”

“Mom,” Emily says, “you circled the gas station twice.”

“I was evaluating my options,” Renee replies.

“You were lost.”

Renee shakes her head and smiles.

She turns into the gravel entrance. The tires crunch over loose stone. A small office building sits off to the left, with rocking chairs lined under the porch roof and a bulletin board displayed behind cloudy plastic.

A man in a dark green jacket walks beside the building, carrying a trash bag toward a large bin. He is thin and slightly hunched, moving with quiet precision. His expression is neutral, almost blank, the way someone looks after a long day of repetitive work. When he notices their car, he gives a brief, polite nod.

Emily lifts her fingers to wave. Renee returns the nod and continues down the road.

“Camp maintenance,” Renee says. “Or the custodian.”

Emily watches the man until the car moves past.

“He seemed nice,” she says.

“Or shy,” Renee replies. “Or avoiding us. Hard to say.”

They continue through the inner loop of the campground. Wooden posts with numbers mark the sites. Many are empty. A few campers pack up hurriedly, tossing folded tents and coolers into vehicles before driving off. The place has been draining of people since the sun began lowering.

Emily notices them disappearing.

“This place feels emptier than I expected,” she says.

“Probably just the weather,” Renee says. “Rain scares people who like comfort.”

Emily smirks.

“You like comfort.”

“I love comfort,” Renee says.

They reach Lot 23. Renee parks the car in the clearing and shuts off the engine. The quiet that follows is deep and immediate.

Emily steps out. The air is crisp and clean, filled with the scent of pine needles and cold soil. She inhales slowly.

“It is nice,” she says.

Renee steps beside her.

“It is peaceful,” she says. “We needed peaceful.”

She reaches over and straightens Emily’s hood.

“No casserole dishes. No ringing phones. No well-meaning neighbors with sympathy cards shaped like flowers.”

Emily makes a face.

“I swear, if someone brings one more tuna casserole…”

“I will bury it in the yard,” Renee says.

Emily laughs. For a second, grief loosens.

They begin unloading. Emily takes the tent bag and chairs while Renee sets down the tarp and cooking bin. They carry everything to the flattest part of the site.

Footsteps crunch behind them.

The campsite worker approaches with a mesh bag of firewood. He stops at a comfortable distance.

“Evening,” he says quietly. “Just checking on new arrivals.”

His voice is soft, cautious.

Renee smiles.

“Thanks,” she says. “Everything looks good.”

“The office is open until sundown,” he replies. “If you need anything.”

Emily nods.

“Thank you.”

He gives a short nod and continues down the loop, disappearing behind a curve.

Renee watches him go.

“He seems gentle,” she says.

“Or allergic to talking,” Emily adds.

“Relatable,” Renee whispers.

They get back to the tent. Emily spreads the fabric. Renee begins threading the poles. They work in a steady rhythm until Renee lifts one of the longer poles to form the first arch.

A sharp crack echoes across the clearing.

Emily jumps.

The pole has snapped cleanly in the middle.

“Oh come on,” Renee mutters.

Emily crouches beside her.

“We cannot fix that,” she says. “We should go ask the campsite guy. He probably knows how to deal with this.”

Renee pauses.

“What was his name,” Emily asks. “Did he tell us?”

“No,” Renee says. “I do not remember. I think he had a name tag on his jacket but i was too busy not paying attention.”

Emily nods slowly.

“He probably has real tools. Maybe a spare tent. tape?”

Renee lifts the broken pole and looks at the sky growing dimmer.

“Let us try to fix it ourselves first,” she says. “If it collapses, we can blame the maintenance guy for not magically appearing. Besides, I have tape. Is it strong tape? We’ll find out but i will be using the whole roll.”

Emily laughs.

“Deal.”

They brace the broken pieces and wrap them in several layers of tape. When they lift the structure, the tent rises crooked but stands firm enough for the night.

“It has personality,” Emily says.

Renee groans.

“It really does.”

They finish setting up camp. Chairs unfold near the fire ring. The lantern is hung from a low branch. The stove sits on steady ground.

The campground grows quiet. A few remaining campers leave. A single lantern flickers in the distance, then disappears.

They cook a simple dinner. They eat slowly, talking about small, safe things. Movies. Classes. Neighbors. Anything that is not grief. Anything that is not the vacancy waiting at home.

When the sky darkens fully, they climb into the tent. Emily zips the flap closed behind her. The air inside is cool but still.

“Mom,” Emily says softly.

“Yes,” Renee replies.

“I am glad we came,” Emily says. “Even for one night.”

Renee lies still for a moment.

“I am glad too,” she says. “I would not have wanted to be here by myself.”

Emily smiles in the dark.

Outside, the forest shifts. A breeze slides through the branches, leaves rustling. The night deepens.

CHAPTER TWO: The Call

The campground office sits quiet beneath the dim glow of a single porch light. The rocking chairs are empty. A moth taps against the glass door in slow, repeated motion, beating its wings in small dull flutters against the reflection.

Inside the office, the campground worker sits at a small desk with a stack of paperwork in front of him. Checklists of do’s, and more do’s to maintain campsite regulations. He is not really reading. His eyes drift over the forms without focus. The radio clipped to his belt crackles softly every few minutes, small bursts of static that fill the silence.

He rubs the bridge of his nose. The long day has left an ache behind his eyes. He had cleaned the bathhouse, hauled trash, restocked firewood, and walked every loop twice. He does not complain. This kind of work suits him. Predictable. Quiet. Nothing unexpected.

He reaches for the half cup of coffee he had forgotten about earlier. Even though it’s cold now, he drinks it anyway.

The radio on his belt finally crackles with clarity.

Dispatch voice:
“Ridge Line maintenance, do you copy.”

He picks up the radio and presses the button.

“Copy.”

“Got a call from the county line,” the voice replies. “Someone reported a truck broken down on the mountain pass. Caller could not stay. Vehicle description is white. Possibly empty. Should be a half mile from your entrance.”

He sits up a little straighter.

“Is it blocking the road,” he asks.

“Unknown. Caller said it looked abandoned. You close enough to check?”

He nods, even though they cannot see him.

“On my way.”

“Keep your radio on. Signal gets weak near the bend.”

He clips the radio back onto his belt, grabs his jacket, and steps outside. The cold greets him immediately. He pulls the zipper up to his chin. The sky has deepened into heavy winter-dark blue. The campground behind him is nearly silent. One lantern still flickers faintly at a distant site, but most tents, the few that remain, sit in darkness.

1pq65m1,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1pq65m1/lance_vs_james/,Lance vs James,"So Lance posted a video (link below) about three things not to do when doing a pour over. Two of these things contradict, what James has been preaching:

a) Don't boil your water (93°C max)

b) Don't do 5+ pours

Now, here is my conundrum:

I'd trust James with my life. He is the best coffee-related YouTuber out there by far in any possible dimension. But: using his techniques have often brought me bitter cups and my draw down times are significantly longer. Following what Lance has said I get more clarity, less bitterness but something that tastes quite empty and doesn't warm my heart the way I want coffee to do. I do not seem to reach a sweet spot, no matter what I do.

I have one theory, but please correct me: is it possible, that the high extraction that James chases masques the bitterness that Lance tries to avoid? James often talks of a ""sudden wall of harshness"" where I experience bitterness as slowly creeping into my cup with higher temps.

Just very frustrated and would like input </3,"So I've lived with my best friend and his partner since 2022. I love them dearly as people and we all pay rent on time. However, they're both just... so messy. This has been such a reoccurring issue throughout all these years and multiple discussions have been had where I've been like ""hey, I'm constantly picking up after you guys and i shouldn't have to ask yall to literally just wipe down a counter or keep your stuff from completely cluttering the coffee table because I'm not your mom and I have a lot on my plate as it is and also please be careful with my stuff and stop getting crumbs on y $300+ rug and not cleaning it up"" and I'm met with a bunch of sorries and promises of change, and things will improve for like a week before returning to how they were. I hate having people over. The living room smells like a teenage boy because best friend's partner practically lives on the couch and isn't the neatest person ever, (by this I mean they are there. All day. every day. 24/7. Like I love them and all and they're unemployed and in online college but they do not do outside. ever.) best friend himself has hoarder tendencies I've had to bear with for the past few years, and literally every time I get sick or have a bad day, the house gets so, SO messy when I already have trouble keeping up with the mess in the first place. We have a dish schedule and they miss their days all of the time, but god forbid I miss my day once or twice because I'm feeling sick or I had to work a double, because then it's a whole thing. (Not saying I shouldn't be held accountable for that-- I should!! But it really feels like they are not holding themselves to the same standard at all.)

Again, I've had many, MANY sit downs and conversations about this and literally beggedddddd them to please PLEASE just pick up after themselves only for this to just continue. I feel so undervalued and I'm legit embarrassed to have people over and I'm confined to my room all of the time, which is not how I want to live at all. I've tried being nice, which is ineffective, and I've tried being firm, which best friend makes me feel like I'm being unreasonable for and gets really emotional which in turn makes me feel horrible, and I also just HATE doing that??? like I don't want to be mean to him! I love him very much, he's my best friend! I just don't feel like I should be begging grown adults to clean up after themselves!

I plan on moving cities all together within the next year for many reasons, though I've gotten quite pessimistic responses from both of them, but honestly, I really can't be living with them much longer, it really, REALLY weighs on me. But I have months until I make the big move, so I'm still living with them for months out. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I could try?

EDIT: I also think it's important to note that originally it was ONLY me and best friend living together with his partner visiting sometimes, but a month into living together, best friend's partner had issues with their current living situation and it was kind of thrust upon me that we had to take them in and I was sort of put into a position where I'd kind of be a horrible person if I said no, but I really REALLY had my hesitations for multiple reasons and one of them was because I saw something like this happening. I was also told this was a temporary thing, but now it's been years, so I've kinda just accepted it. Anyway, they were unemployed as they are now so I reluctantly agreed to letting them freeload since. like. obviously where are they gonna get money for rent, yknow??

Two years ago, I started working at a boutique during a really difficult period in my life. I had just been laid off from a tech job and my brother had passed away. I took the job to get myself back on my feet mentally, and I became very close with the assistant manager. We leaned on each other and built what felt like a solid, supportive friendship.

About a year later, I moved out of state to California for work. I got a job in medical billing and focused heavily on stabilizing myself financially and paying off my student loans. We stayed close, and since I wasn’t planning on traveling back home while focusing on debt, she came to visit me instead.

That visit ended up changing how I feel about the friendship.

It wasn’t one big incident, but a pattern of behavior that made me feel judged, criticized, and uncomfortable, especially in my own home.

Some specific moments that stood out:

When I picked her up from the airport, she said she was hungry. I took her to In-N-Out since it’s an iconic California spot. She criticized the fries and complained about there being a lot of high schoolers there (it was midnight on a Friday).

She assumed she would take my bed and questioned why I didn’t have an air mattress or pull out bed for myself. I ultimately gave her my bed to avoid conflict.

She made repeated comments about my roommate, criticizing her for a brief phone call, having the TV on at night, and the furniture she had in the front yard.

At Disneyland, we had agreed to get coffee beforehand. I missed the Starbucks entrance by a few feet, and she scoffed and rolled her eyes. When we reached Starbucks, she refused to wait in line and insisted we go elsewhere. I eventually told her I was going to Starbucks anyway.

Later, she told me that I was upset about the situation because I had a “sugar crash” from my chai latte.

When I needed to charge my phone, she questioned whether I “needed to be reachable.”

At one point I got sunscreen in my eye and couldn’t see properly. She told me to “cry it out” and seemed irritated when I said I wanted to rinse it out.

Individually, none of these moments are huge, but taken together, the tone felt dismissive and critical rather than supportive. I felt uncomfortable and on edge in my own home.

I brought this up to her later. She said she was shocked to learn she had done anything wrong, apologized, and said it wasn’t her intention, but also didn’t really understand why these things were hurtful.

I want to forgive her, but I can’t shake how the visit made me feel or how much it changed my perception of the friendship.

Am I overreacting? Or is it reasonable to take distance even if she didn’t intend harm?",2,1766101268.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

1pq5wjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/1pq5wjj/letter_thanks_doc/,[Letter] Thanks Doc,"Dear Dr. Peterson.

Thank you.  Thank you for all that you've done.  I know you're in rough shape right now, but I got to write this out before my mind shifts to the next task.  Maybe you'll get it, maybe you won't, but that's not going to stop me because I know there are others like me out there that want to put this into words, but don't have the time or feel hesitant in these crazy times to say anything good or hopeful.  Also, to add, some people think like me: that they have to be extremely sophisticated, and use their keyboard and vocabulary much like a surgeon guides a scalpel on a patient. Makes sense.  Wouldn't go cuttin' on someone with a Boyscout Pocket knife to fix a heart murmur. Hopefully you or the reader forgives me when I bludgeon out the keys to my thoughts, and understand I took my education for granted with premature cynicism, and undiagnosed ADHD. (The latter which, after a terrible therapist and absent psychologist office, didn't get diagnosed with until my mid twenties through testing. Also had to do my own research and reading on it.) But, I digress...

I want to thank you for all the piecing together of the past, and driving your soul into the depth of the human conscience.  The latter, which is a very complex, sorrow filled, brutal, and beautiful thing. Much like the ""rose bud blossoming before us"", that if we are not mindful of life, we will miss its transformation and quickly be left with a withered stem. There is nothing in your book, Twelves Rules for Life, that when I return to it, my mind has racing epiphany's saying ""AH!  That's it!"" or ""That sound just like when..."" Many times over I have listened to it doing my mundane (but important) job, and an issue that has come up recently or in the past, that I didn't relate to an experience I, or another was going through. I will keep listening and peeling back the barriers that I've put up over the years to everyone. Mostly, through speaking the truth.  (With tact, of course. Sometimes you still have to decide on what you tolerate, and what peace you want in your life.) We all have heard the cliches of the past, and take on the hard lessons taught over and over for granted by our own narcissism and blindness to the realities that are before us. Maybe it's due to our sophomoric (Or as I call it, ""Sophmoronic"".  Patent Pending) understanding of the world, each other, and ourselves.  I don't know. But, what I do know is that in these online spaces that cocoon us into a selective algorithmic ""Pidgeon hole"", we get our biases confirmed, and our minds shut closed in the echo chamber. This, I believe whole heartedly.  I have friends on both sides, and when I check my social media posts, two people who have never met one another, are posting up things.  Things separate from one another, in other groups, that if you didn't know the user interface and how it's patterned, you would guess that they would be arguing.  But, they are not.  They are tossing it up on the screen, pointing, screaming for someone to do something into the crowded fish bowl of their peers amongst their ""tribe"", then going back to their 9-5, a little more resentful.  I should know.  I was and still am one of those types of people.  Perhaps I should look more into Adlerian psychology again, but you really can only *somewhat* control the chaos around you physically and others around you in your closer more personal circle.

That's just part of it.

I want to thank you for the bravery you have shown through your lectures and debates.  Meeting with your ""enemy"", and ""listening as though they know something you don't.""  To listen like that, you truly have to pay attention to everything.  From subtle cues of the face and fidgeting of the body, to how they phrase things and nuance in how it's said.  You've caught this before, exposing those who in one way speak to you in a different manner when the cameras are rolling.  And in those moments you really set a ""Hah, Gotcha."" moment. I've had moments like those before.  When the person across from you is not truly listening to you, and are just waiting to speak.  They show their true colors with false pre-conceived notions and then use their words as daggers to cut at you, and twist your speech with a wrench.  Twisting, much like the over-tightening of a bolt on the intake manifold of an engine block, that causes the head to snap. When that's done, it then takes a very specialized set of tools and experience... Almost an artform, to take the destroyed nut out, assess the damage done to the manifold and block itself, and replace what's needed entirely or bit by bit masterfully so that the engine is running soundly to avoid catastrophic failure when you roll down the highway. Mechanics will get this, but basically you have to go over and fix a possible few hours job to a 12 hrs job, and not throw your tools at the next person who chirps up with something ""smart"" to say. What's even more nerve wracking to me though, is the public speaking. Having the contempt of a crowd that's truly listening is a scary thought. what's even scarier, is the contempt of the parroting mob with it's ears covered, and mouths open.  Chanting rehearsed phrases from their professors to get the approval their parents may have never given them, or approval of their peers who don't know anything about them... A person, I can usually handle, but a mob can very easily be at times as smart as their dumbest participant. Said idiot can set off a small spark and soon a blaze in seconds with the mob cheering in gleeful delight.  That's what I see some of these ""protests"" coming to. And because someone said a few ""mean"" words eloquently and bring receipts, why not have the ""useful idiots"" set themselves upon them.  If they talk too much, these people might start thinking for themselves. In your bravery though, you've taken them on before and with experience unraveled some of their tricks.  I don't know all of your interactions by heart, and maybe you stepped into their traps here and there.  Even the most clever gets their foot stuck in a hole from time to time.  But, even if you do trip up you seemed to get back up and dust yourself off.

Thank you, for talking about ""love"".  Love has many meanings, depending on the context.  Unfortunately, in doing so it's well... lost impact. When I was a kid, When people said they ""loved"" me, I didn't know what to think.  Most of the time, it came across as ""like"".  Love, to me, is something very intimate and personal.  And when someone whom I've had a few conversations with about something mundane, or hobbies wise says, ""I love you man.""  Some people use it much like a anti-depressant.  They prescribe the word to others in a way to placate them or try and steady the waters.  Soon though, they use it too much or for too long, and people develop a sort of tachyphylaxis. Their mind builds up an immunity to it, and it's no longer effects them, even when delivered by others.  Thus, they then fall into a pit of despair for a few days... weeks... months... etc.  Also, those who are suppose to accept this ""love"" just don't want to take the medication ""love"" due to fear. Past experiences, Side-effects, and what might happen for better or worse is frightful. (Have you ever REALLY listened to the ending of a drug infomercial?) Whatever ""love"" this person puts into your system may be completely wrong for you, and you may not need it in the first place. A new molecular entity might help, or leave you maimed and attached to a colostomy bag. Or worse... Side effects do sometimes include: Sudden death. But, this ""love"" is more a ""like""  And like you said, (roughly speaking, of course): ...Doing something for someone so they ""like"" you, is not love.  That's very true.  Currently, and for some time I've ignored the Dragon nestled in my house, but fortunately I've not gotten to the point where I'm mopping the grass with Pine-Sol. (Or vacuuming it after said dragon eats my pancakes.) Love is definitely more than words.  It's the discipline of waking up and taking care of your kids.  It's the scars on your parents hands from the glue/sealer at the factory you work at to feed your family that burnt you, or the pains from your back when a pipe fell onto your shoulder. You never reported it to work because you knew you would get fired because an OSHA rep would have thumbed their nose at you... Then have you fired for ""liability"" reasons when they've barely left the comforts of their climate controlled office and have no clue what a cutting torch is if it heated their coffee. Love is raising a handful of kids and doing your best with what you have financially, and the lessons you've learned growing up from life, parents, and your own pursuit of knowledge if you've had any time for. Lessons you tried teaching them in the shop, house, on a baseball field, basketball court, football field, or mowing an unkempt yard of St Augustine. (""Don't park on the grass, son."") Though, you did let them go off and still do their own things.  Be it artistic pursuits or medical.  Because you knew deep down you loved them, but smothering them or helicoptering them would make them resent you.  Your advice was always, ""Just do your best. Work hard. If you want it, just go on 'n get it."" Words that still hit me, even though my impatient mind wanted the answer to all my problems yesterday.

Thank you for talking about heaving the stone before you.  Trying something new.  Mixing things up.  Because we don't really find our calling in doing mundane work...  We can find bits of our purpose, and do the job well while also finding purpose and fulfillment in life.  It's  always revolving around the act to strive.  To bend, struggle, triumph, fail, and just live.  You can't appreciate the wins without the loses.  Life without well... death.  Because those two things are certain.  And if you waive off things, and act as though time is going to be around well... it's the cliched ""life will catch up to you.""  Which I guess that's why some people recall their life when they have a near-death experience... but I digress, I don't want to dwell on that but be aware of it's approach. That way I will do what I set out to do, and not regret anything on the day it greets me. Life though, back to life. Life is actually really fucking interesting.  Scientifically, socially, spiritually.  Scientifically when I see new technologies bring ""science fiction"" to life and advancing us, to when I brewed ""wine"" using some bread yeast and a balloon with a pinhole in it. (To all my ADHDr's... Do **NOT** leave it in the closet and out of your sight. If you try doing this and hiding it from your parents as a young kid:  You'll possibly get a grape-slopsion all over your nice clothes, or forget it and your shirts will smell funky for some time.) My uncontrolled curiosity and hyper-fixation has lead me down many... many little hobbies with many interesting people who a connect with I guess... in some ways on varying spiritual levels. The disposable income I've had through frugal-ness habits helps in exploring paths. A few such habits are paying off loans as early as possible, not going out and drinking my money away, and sacrificing having ""nice"" and ""new"" vehicles with all the bells and whistles that cost 400-2000$ to fix. Debt kinda gives me anxiety at times, so I just focus on the big chunks with higher interest and work my way down. Alcohol well... I just don't like how it makes me feel or how i feel about others nursing it and hangovers suck. And instead of the top model cars, I opt for a good used one that gets me from a to b that I can turn a wrench on and avoid a terrible mechanic. *Aside: (Like the one who ripped the boot/gasket around the stick shift of a previous vehicle. I bought all the parts to put in it. He lost a damn screw to seal the little console the stick shift passed through, making the small truck smell like transmission fluid when driven.  You suck by the way. 800$ for ""labour"" repair bill my ass.  I've seen people replace clutch plates on their damn chest under a tree you d\*\*ks. AND I saw the actual time on the vehicals clock from when you disconnected the battery and how long it was disconnected / you worked on it. Rushed job, shit detail, I'm glad y'all went outta business.)*  Sometimes heaving the many stones in life, or biting the bullet and having others gets you mixed results.  But there's lessons to be learned in each experience.  Especially if your mind goes to them.  Like ya said, something about: If your mind dwells on an experience, let it.  It might be trying to teach you a lesson... Like fix your own damn transmission on your chest, or when you sobered up halfway through a night out what your consciousness notices and why people use alcohol, or the math behind interest rates and how it's set up to basically double the lenders money while being a pain and inconvenience to pay the principal amount jumping through hoops each time.  Things have gotten more complicated after each and every generation it seems.  And the best advice is you now have to be even more thorough and literate than ever if you are to go through life.  Especially with the advancements in technology.  I don't blame ""Boomers"" not wanting to use a computer... If you've ever had Ransomware accidentally installed on your PC visiting a possible mentors/clients website... Well, you just gotta accept it as a loss and completely re-format the Drives.  At least you'll be starting with a blank slate, and all the clutter is gone.  Just hope nothing too important is lost.  Those moments feel like you tossed the stone behind ya far back. But, the next toss forward your aim is a little better, and the stone a little lighter. Setbacks are just part of it. We all sin.  Miss the mark.  But, you gotta either take up and notch another arrow in the quiver, or go up to the target and ""yank the sum'bitch out"" and use that arrow. Or axe, or knife, or any tools at our exposure to toss at the target.  We all have our strengths, weaknesses, and jobs in life.  And it's best to explore them in life. Another cliche quote I'd say is: ""All the world's a stage And all the men and women merely players;"" and wax poetics off a that small bit, but I'll add the rest after it

""All the world’s a stage,

And all the men and women merely players;

They have their exits and their entrances;

And one man in his time plays many parts,""

I'm one of the people who got a ""useless degree""  that relates to the above quote.  I enjoyed it, loved doing it, met a few good people, but... didn't quite fit in with the rest of the class. Kinda felt like a quiet Billy Bob Thornton among them, but I kept my mouth shut and listened, and learned most people here are full of themselves it seems.  ""Fake it 'till you make it.""  is terrible, half-assed, advice in a area where you can easily be found out as a fraud, gossiped to by the end of the day, and your reputation shattered alongside your psyche while you don't remember who the hell you are anymore.  Maybe that's why Hollywood folks go nuts.  It's a self-obsessive, optics bubble that teaches you to ""Be yourself!  You're great at any size!"" while telling you to be a fake and catch imposter syndrom. These same people will mock you for being too hefty or talk behind your back that ""You need to lose a little weight"" to your co-actors and revel in your failure.  That, or will throw you under the bus after disrupting your rehearsals they volunteered for in front of a teacher to look good, and not accept your apology while they snatch a bottle of Rose you promised them if they went along with the scene and did the best they could during the exam.  Oh well.  Many lessons I learned that day. It's a tough business, and hard thing to do for someone that's never taken a lesson, and did on a whim one day in high school. (Which I commend you, for doing your own recording for the Audiobook.  You didn't read it like a robot, but more like a lecture and that you were speaking to someone in the room you cared about.  When you choke up about the rose bud or your friend Chris... well, I choke up too.  I've experienced that, and it still makes my eyes well up with tears when I think of my friend who also took his life.)

I'm starting to run outta steam writing this, and my mind is starting to ramble on and go on to another main issue in my life that definitely needs attention.  Maybe I'll write a part 2 in the future, but I wanted to get something out there. Fire this arrow out and see where it lands.  Maybe someone else will do the same and we'll start a club.  Who knows.  I ain't designing the jackets, but I don't want something silly on them.

I now come to a close. I cannot thank you more than what I owe, or what the world owes to you in gratitude. For all what I mentioned, and all that slips my mind and will end up in part 2 I guess.  I'm just me, some guy posting on a forum.  I hope you have a good Christmas surrounded by your loved ones, and that you get well soon friend.  Maybe I'll check out the Peterson Academy, but I got some things I got to take care of personally first. So,Thank you Doc.  Thank you for everything.

**Bearded Iris** has brewed a new brew - *Peacemaker*. This is a 7.5% West Coast IPA with Strata, Amarillo, Cascade, Citra, Mosaic, and Simcoe. Does have some earthly pine, but disagree with a lingering bitterness outlined on their instagram. This one was brewed at Wiseacre in Memphis. And, yes, the rumor is true: They do have Guiness on tap. 

I would be remise if I did not also add **Broadcast Brewing** has *Sang Bleu* on, as well. They also have *Duchesse de Bourgogne* (Brouwerij Verhaeghe), *PB&J Mixtape* (Xul), *Lunch* (Maine Brewing), *Dad's Oatmeal Cookie Stout* (O'Fallon), *lightgrinder* (Burial), and *whiteferari* (Veil) on tap.

**Black Abbey** has announced their holiday closings. Tomorrow it is closed for Christmas Carols. Full, but you can get on the wait list. Also closed Christmas Eve and Day.

**Crazy Gnome** is releasing a winter peppermint stout tomorrow. They are having a weekend festivity this weekend with F.A.B. Pizza and they will have stuff for the kiddos, as well. And *Grayson's* other spot - **Cyanide Cider** has a sparkly cider called a snow globe.

**Fait la Force** is having a *Krampus Rampage* this Saturday. Raffle with 1 ticket for each drink or food drive item you deliver. Tickets are $30/pp and can be found [here](https://www.musiccitybrewhop.com/krampus-rampage). Also on the Rampage are **New Heights**, **Jakcalope**, and **Cyanide Cider**. Earlier that day, they will have *Horse Girl Holiday* from 11AM - 5PM. Vintage clothing, art, gifts, and flash tattoos. 

**Jackalope**is giving away tickets to *Trevor Wallace's Alpha Beta Male* show at the Ryman on January 8th. Go to [this post](https://www.instagram.com/p/DSaUDE9lVZn/) and follow instructions. Winner announced December 26th. 

**Marble Fox** has a few new ones out recently, as well. I had the *Blackberry Blended Illusion* the other day and if you like fruited sours, this is a nice brew. Also grabbed their stouts *Snowbound* and *Eternal Remedy*, which clocks in at 10.1% ABV. Still bottles of the barrel aged *Hans* and *Eternal Remedy* in the taproom.

*Nashville Roadies* will be at **New Heights** on January 9th for their end of year party. The *Bluegrass Bazaar* is set for February 21. On Fridays, you can get *Gold Lite* for $5 from 6 Pm to Close. 

No date yet for **Southern Grist** closing down The Nations for a few weeks (followed by East Nashville) to rebrand as Xul. I'm regularly in touch with the guys so will let you know when they are pulling the trigger. Currently, you can grab LFG bottles at both taprooms. The latest I have, which is now on the website, is B1T, Hill, and some of the IPAs will continue to exist even after Xul takes over. And it is confirmed PB&J Mixtape will be on tap at both locations. *Peanut Butter Copra Kai*, *Midnight Crisp*, and *Greenwood Porter* are also out now.

**Tailgate Brewery** spins tunes at OG on Charlotte most Tuesdays. They have also added Vinyl Nights at East Nashville on the 2nd & 4th Monday. Feel free to pack some discs and bring them over. 

**Yazoo** has released a dark lager called *Use the Schwarz, Luke*, another on cask *I Hate It When the Schwarz Gets Tangled* and a cask Coffee Stout *Pilot Series 07"". They will have comedy at 8 PM on January 2nd, unless something changes. 

Christmas Popups: **Tailgate** has a popup at Germantown - *A German(town) Christmas* - and Murfreesboro - *Evergreen* - in the Greater Nashville metro area. Another in Chattanooga, if anyone wants to brewsplore. **East Nashville Beer Works** has a Home Alone themed popup called *Kevin McCallister's House*. OG will be closed on Christmas, but open 11AM - 3PM on Christmas Eve. Normal hours NYE and NYD.

Maybe I’m writing this just because right now I’m in so much pain or perhaps because I actually did fuck up my life.

As a naive 19 y.o girl I did a mini gastric bypass surgery.
I was around 100kg, and I’m 173 cm.
My whole life I suffered from body image issues.
Having a narcissistic mother who is obsessed with weight loss I spent my whole life being body shamed, to the point that I completely believe I was the size of an elephant, when I was just a chubby kid. If you wonder how bad it is, I have been dieting like crazy since the 6th grade.

Yes, I wasn’t skinny but I also wasn’t obese, yet I completely believed it. My environment was no less than toxic and being abused my whole life wasn’t very good for my self-esteem to say the least, and neither was the bullying. 

My mother had her surgery in 2022, as she wanted the easiest way out. The surgery itself is a good idea and I know it is in fact NOT the easy way, it is meant to help people who want to put in the work and care about their health, not to heal people with eating disorders.

Here it comes down to me.
I was hit by a car at the age of 15. I stayed in the hospital for 9 days and had surgery on my foot. After that, I spent my whole teenage years going back and forth to hospitals for my foot. 
By the age of 19, I gained +20 kg because of stress and not being active because of my injury.
All of a sudden my life was getting better and I was off to college, yet the only thing my brain could think about was as always, “I need to lose weight”.

It was March 2023 when my mother suggested I do the surgery just like her, she said it’s only hard the first two months and then you feel nothing and have no side effects (what a lie.) and I just wanted to be “skinny for life”, Agreed.
Yes, my BMI was high, but did I actually need the surgery? No. 

I paid the doctors to give me approvals, with the help of my mother, as she is an expert in this apparently.
And although many of them said I just need to try harder to lose weight (I did, it was no good or I would break down and gain it all back) and that it might be hard to approve me for the surgery, once money was offered, nothing was an issue.
This is fucked up, I know. 

I wish someone stood up and refused to give me the approval, I wish the nurses or anyone literally slapped me and said wtf you doing. But no one did, they just said “You’re not that fat” and I was a stupid 19-year-old.o I replied with “I have a foot injury and can’t suffer with my weight for life.” And that is true.
I did suffer because of my weight, mentally, physically, and socially. I just wanted a better life for myself. But I didn’t know what I was signing myself up to. 
I was approved for my surgery in June, that’s only a three-month planning, for a lifelong commitment. 

My surgery comes, I handle the pain because I have strong reasons and well, and only after 2 months I leave my country to study abroad. As a result, I stop following up with my doctors, and it’s just me and my new scars against the world. I did eat healthy, work out, and lost 20 Kg. 

My first year and a half after surgery was not a big issue, I was happy, in fact, I was glowing. My body was always complimented, I never felt stronger and somehow I crave salads instead of cake. Yet let’s be honest diarrhea isn’t a joke.

Now it’s 2025, and all hell broke loose.
I have been fainting nonstop and for no clear reason, maybe it’s college stress or an actual illness, we have been trying to figure this out for the last 7 months.

My doctors thought it was diabetes, but it’s not.
Others thought it was heart issues, cancer, strokes, but all tests came back saying I’m fine.

I am still not sure if what causes my fainting is dumping syndrome or not, or if it is + something else, but here I am, after I fainted and fell down and broke my foot, sitting in bed, and wondering about my life choices.

My blood sugar just dropped to 2.9 mmol/L, which is severe Hypoglycemia. I only ate one piece of pancake with a spoonful of maple syrup. The ER doctor said this happens to a lot of young women and that it should go away by itself once I’m older?! 

I just hate that I went through a near-death experience for eating a slice of pancakes, drinking a slushy or drinking coffee.

I don’t think the surgery itself is bad. It changed my life for the better in so many ways and I’m sure it did to others as well. Although I wonder what if sometimes, at the end of the day, I’m the one who walked into the surgery room completely ready and without force, so I can’t point fingers even if I feel betrayed by everyone who didn’t stop me.

I’m more mature now and know that no one’s value is connected to their looks or weight( never judged people before) but this also applies to me, which no one ever taught me before.
 
I’m here to ask, if anyone has gone through something similar, if anyone deals with severe dumping syndrome, how to deal with it, any recommendations for specific tests, if anyone did a reverse surgery and if it did help in any kind of way, or any advice you think I should hear.

1pq5rr3,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pq5rr3/choices/,Choices,"A scene from my memory:

It's around six in the morning and the world is quiet. The first amber rays of sunlight are peeking through the barren trees and reflecting on the snow in my backyard. I've just woken up and taken a look out of my window. I'm happy to see the snow still hasn't melted and my yard looks like a winter wonderland. I didn't drink the night prior.

I look over at my wife sleeping peacefully and listen to my dogs breathe (loudly, I would add, since those little things seem to really snore). It's too early for them to eat, since they generally eat at eight, so I let everyone sleep and go downstairs.

I make myself a cup of coffee and get dressed. I need to go somewhat far back into the yard to check on the water for the chickens. It's likely frozen, so I fill up a pot with warm water from the sink and make the trek. I unlock their coop and sure enough, the top layer is solid ice. I'll have to pour some of the hot water on it and then try to break the rest with a sharp tool. It's really cold outside, but it's peaceful, and it's fine. Everything is clear and new.

I go back into the house and make a list of what I need to do for the day. It's still early so I'm in no rush. I sit on my couch in the stillness and just exist. There are a million things to get done, but it doesn't matter, I'll get to them.

Another scene from my memory:

It's the same type of winter day but it's 8:30 and the dogs are going absolutely nuts because they're hungry and just tend to do that at this time. I'm already exhausted, I've just fallen asleep since being awake at 3 am for no reason, filled with anxiety and panic. My head hurts, my throat is dry. I'm beyond hungover. I immediately smell myself and realize I probably smell like beer. Shit. I forgot to shower.

I don't want my wife to know I was drunk yesterday. Alone. Not like it matters because she doesn't care when I drink. She doesn't know how tough it is for me to NOT drink, so she doesn't realize I am struggling. If she knew, she would care. 

My first instinct is to wake her and ask her to take the dogs out and to eat, but I can't do that - she worked late while I was home drinking and despite my hangover it just wouldn't be fair.

I take the dogs, I'm angry they're being so hyper, and I feed them. I'm dreading going outside for the chickens. I'm not even going to get dressed and run outside with no shirt on into their coop and pray they don't need the ice broken. I'm lucky this time that it somehow didn't freeze, but now I'm rushing to get the dogs back in because it's cold and I'm not properly dressed. I call their names and it hurts my head. The bright light hurts my eyes. I feel like shit.

I go inside, pound a glass of water and check my phone. Thankfully I didn't say anything stupid. I successfully avoided talking to anyone the night before just to make sure I wouldn't. Instead I just drank alone on my couch and was sure to be in bed early so not even my wife would know I was drinking. All the cans are in the outside garbage so there's no evidence.

I have a million things to do today. I'm not even entertaining that. I'm going back to sleep, or at least going to attempt to. Instead I lay in my bed most of the day trying to sleep and instead feeling sorry for myself and nursing a horrible hangover.

Both of these have been my reality, and not too far apart. I'm writing it out so I can compare it to myself and look at the insanity for what it is. I'm not drinking tonight. If you're thinking about drinking tonight, picture these two scenarios. If either of these were a choice, which would be more preferable?

I'll take the morning tranquility over the morning headache any day. Sometimes it's hard to do. Still, I fight on.",4,1766100770.0,stopdrinking,2,1.0,False

The natural flavors in fruit are often really delicate aromatics. Even just fermenting a fruit alone is enough to radically alter the flavor in a way that will barely resemble its fresh flavor profile. If you’ve ever cooked with fruit you’ll know that you lose nearly all of the delicate fruit flavors…and that cooking generally occurs at way lower temperatures than coffee roasting…however extracts natural and artificial can often survive and still shine in these conditions. 

I’m pretty skeptical that coffee that basically bumps up with some fruit could absorb enough of its likeness that it would still be present after drying, shipping, roasting, resting and ultimately brewing the finished cup.  

Am I dead wrong? How could a finished cup still taste dominantly like pink starbursts, or watermelon, or peach without extracts or aroma compounds? ",6,1766100746.0,pourover,8,0.67,False

1pq5p1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/NFLv2/comments/1pq5p1e/sack_master_john_abraham_paid_a_steep_price_for/,Sack Master John Abraham paid a steep price for success. He’s still recovering.,"TIMMONSVILLE, S.C. — It all began here for John Abraham, in a modest house built by his grandfather, surrounded by dirt roads and tobacco fields, not far from a gas station with no sign in a town where gnats swarm.

Abraham began working in those fields when he was 5. He helped his grandfather nail shingles on roofs, change the oil in farmers’ pickup trucks, unclog drains and scrub toilets in the local schools. As he grew, he cleaned dishes in a restaurant kitchen and made it your way at a fast-food burger joint, anything to help his mother pay the bills.

When he discovered football in his senior year at Lamar High School, it was an escape from work. Abraham felt such joy from the game that he was OK with getting home from practice at 10 p.m. after waiting hours for a friend, cousin, neighbor — anyone — to pick him up and drive him nine miles back to Timmonsville. He played so hard and well that they eventually displayed his jersey number on the stadium press box. It’s still there, next to Levon Kirkland’s.

Then came the losses. His last two years at South Carolina, the team lost 21 of 22 games. When the Jets were losing his first NFL preseason game, he shed tears on the sideline. He couldn’t take it anymore.

Abraham learned to lose. And then he learned to win. He played 15 NFL seasons, became known as one of the most feared pass rushers in the game and finished with 133.5 sacks — 13th most since the statistic became official 43 years ago.

But there was a steep price, beyond the millions of dollars squandered on bad investments, family and friends with hands out, dozens of fines for ignoring rules and a life in the fast lane. He also paid with a brain that bled on both sides, stolen memories, the indignity of seeing his mug shot on the local news, the treadmill that was thrown in his pool, credit cards and phones he kept losing, punched-out car windows and the attempt to get himself shot and killed.

For a long time, Abraham didn’t want to return home.

He liked big-city action.

Now? A small town doesn’t seem so bad.

“With the 13th pick of the 2000 draft, the New York Jets select outside linebacker John Abraham, South Carolina,” NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced at the Theater at Madison Square Garden.

Angry Jets fans filled the arena with boos.

Tagliabue’s pronouncement didn’t sound so good to Abraham, either.

John Abraham.

He hated being called that. Still does.

For much of his youth, he was Tony. His full name is John Antonio Nettles-Abraham, and he didn’t know he was John until a high school teacher started calling him that so he wouldn’t be confused with another Tony.

His father’s name was Curly John Nettles, and they called him “Man” even though he didn’t act much like one. Abraham estimates he saw Man once a year during his childhood.

“I don’t remember hugs, him being cool or saying, ‘Tony, I love you.’” Abraham says. “The only thing I remember is him being drunk and abusive.”

Man walked down Abraham’s block occasionally. When Abraham was about 7, his mother yelled at him about picking up after his newly adopted puppy in the yard. Man heard the commotion and rushed over.

For the 30 years that followed, Abraham couldn’t be around dogs. He thought he was afraid of them. Eventually, he realized his fear emanated from seeing Man stomp his puppy to death.

Man lived with his mother his whole life, unable to make it on his own. Abraham’s mother, Maggie Lee Abraham, didn’t want her son to be a “mama’s boy” like Man, so she was intentionally cold to her son.

Abraham believes he never learned about love, how to receive or give it. He has jumped from relationship to relationship in his adult life without ever committing.

“I should have been a married man, a happy man,” he says. “But I think I run away from love.”

When Abraham went to high school, Maggie Lee didn’t want him to play football, so he played basketball and ran track, setting a South Carolina high school record with a time of 22.6 seconds in the 200-meter dash. She relented his senior year, and then, with just 22 boys on the team, Abraham played defensive end, wide receiver and kicker, and even ran some plays at quarterback.

At 6-foot-4 and 195 pounds, his instinct was to rush the passer the way he drove the hoop — slithering around obstacles with smooth, graceful movements and unexpected bursts.

“People think because you’re big, you have to be this predator type person, very aggressive,” he says. “In my mind, I wasn’t that.”

His way worked. Clemson wanted him, and he wanted to go there. But then a coach from South Carolina came to his mother’s living room with the Holy Bible on the coffee table and sprinkled his recruiting pitch to her with “amens” and “hallelujahs.”

Maggie Lee told her son that if he went to Clemson, she would not visit him there, but she would be happy to make the drive to Columbia if he attended South Carolina. So he became a Gamecock.

“In college, he was a shy, quiet, country boy, and Columbia was like a big city to him,” says Tarica Worthy, who met Abraham at the start of their freshman year at South Carolina. Three decades later, Abraham calls Worthy his sister. She also could be called a business associate, unofficial therapist and guardian angel.

Abraham never drank in college. Then came the night he was drafted. He was at a party in a Columbia hotel with Shaun Ellis, whom the Jets drafted one pick ahead of Abraham, and other friends.

“I just remember a lot of champagne,” Abraham says. “I don’t remember anything else.”

One of his Jets coaches instructed him to rush the passer by slamming the crown of his helmet into the upper chest of blockers. His NFL playing weight was between 240 and 250 pounds and Abraham still thought of himself as a basketball player in pads, but he did as he was told, banging his helmet into massive opposing linemen thousands of times for years, ignoring the stars that swirled around his head after every collision.

The man who drafted Abraham, Bill Parcells, was known for bringing out the best in Lawrence Taylor, arguably the greatest edge rusher in history. Parcells, who was the Jets’ general manager at the time, goaded Abraham to push himself as he had done with Taylor.

“Can you lift your grandma’s skirt yet?” Parcells asked him.

Abraham wasn’t motivated by sarcasm. Concerned that others thought he wasn’t strong enough, he stopped lifting weights in front of the team and instead worked on his own, away from the facility.

He was a handful for opponents from the start. In Abraham’s second game, the Jets had a one-point lead over the Patriots with 1:28 left. On fourth down, Abraham sacked Drew Bledsoe to effectively end the game. Two weeks later, against the Bucs, he sacked and stripped Shaun King to preserve a four-point lead with 52 seconds left. That was his first of 47 forced fumbles, which is the third most all time.

Abraham had 4.5 sacks by the sixth game when he tore a groin muscle. It meant the end of his rookie season and the beginning of a new lifestyle.

He was stunned by the culture of the Jets. So many players were drinkers, hard-core partiers. Everything that could derail him was easily available. He was encouraged to act like a big-city big shot.

After surgery to repair his muscle tear, the painkillers weren’t doing it. He tried drinking instead, and alcohol made him feel better than the meds. Abraham developed a taste for an imported cognac aged in French oak barrels. Eventually, he had the word “Hennessy” tattooed on the inside of his left arm.

As he recovered, he had a lot of time — too much. Teammates invited him to party with them. Abraham had social anxiety, but he liked strip clubs because the attention was on women in G-strings, not him, and the Hennessy he sipped helped him loosen up.

Worthy says she never thought Abraham had a dependency problem, but drinking resulted in him “putting on a mask and becoming a different person.”

“I thought drinking would make me seem manly,” he says. “So it was a lot of drinking, a lot of sex with different women, smoking cigars. I did this because I didn’t have a definition of a man.”

During his rookie season, Abraham read a story about Deion Sanders trying to improve his relationship with his father and wanted to do the same. He and Man had a common bond now — alcohol. So he picked up Man and they drank together until impulsivity overcame inhibition and Man asked him for money. Abraham didn’t want Man in his life after all, he thought.

Man was one of many family members who wanted something from Abraham. He gave to many.

“Instead of having my mind totally set on being great, I wanted to save everyone,” he says. “It took a lot out of me.”

When he was drafted, Abraham received a $2 million signing bonus. In his second season, he had 13 sacks and six forced fumbles, making the first of five Pro Bowls and three All-Pro teams. By his third season, he was broke, mostly, he says, because of advisers who took advantage of him and made suspect investments.

On his way home from Gentlemen’s Quarters in Long Island in 2003, Abraham drove his new silver Hummer into a fire hydrant and a light pole and was charged with driving while intoxicated. He was playing well that year, with six sacks in six games, when another groin injury ended his season.

Two years later, Abraham wanted a change, and the Jets were happy to facilitate a trade. The Seahawks flew him to Seattle in a private jet. Then the Falcons had another meet him in Seattle to take him to Atlanta. Abraham wanted to play in Atlanta because it was a few hours from home. The Falcons agreed to give the Jets a first-round pick and pay Abraham $45 million over six years.

The Falcons seemed perfect for him. Shortly before the trade, Atlanta hired Kevin Winston as its director of player affairs — Winston had a similar role with the Jets and was familiar with Abraham’s personality and tendencies. Two years later, Mike Smith became the Falcons’ head coach, and his avuncular sensitivity was just what Abraham needed. He was also reunited with defensive line coach Ray “Sugar Bear” Hamilton, who had coached him and bonded with him early in his days with the Jets.

In Abraham’s first game as a Falcon, he had two sacks against the Panthers. Then groin issues flared again, and he broke his thumb. He played only eight games that season. After he was arrested for driving while intoxicated back in his Jets days, Abraham was subject to random testing by the NFL, so he curtailed his drinking. During his first season with the Falcons, he went back to the bottle.

In Atlanta, Abraham felt safe doing things he shouldn’t have been doing because the shadowy characters at the clubs had his back.

“You weren’t going to hear about whatever happened,” Worthy says. “And that can make a person feel invincible.”

He was late for team functions, fell asleep in meetings and skipped substance tests (he says he did not take illegal drugs). Over his career, Abraham, in the estimate of one source, was fined more than $1 million.

“The drinking didn’t impact his ability to practice and perform, but it did impact his life,” says Rich McKay, who was the team’s general manager at the time and now is its CEO. “I would get nervous when I was told he went to South Carolina because a lot of times when he came back, he didn’t look so good.”

Abraham felt a pull to Man again. It had been about 10 years since he last tried to reconcile, and his father had never seen him play a football game. He brought Man to one of his games, and they drank together after. Man, who was in a wheelchair after having his legs amputated because of diabetes, stayed with his son and, in the middle of the night, caused a disturbance, demanding that Abraham wait on him. Abraham had had enough. He sent his father away and never reconnected. Man died in 2014.

In early 2013, Abraham was coming off a 10-sack season and had more career sacks for the Falcons, 68.5, than any player in their history. But he was soon to be 35 years old, and the team had had enough.

“I know it had a lot to do with my off-the-field issues,” he says of being cut.

As a free agent, Abraham drew interest from multiple teams, including the Dolphins and Patriots, for whom he badly wanted to play. However, he said he “self-sabotaged” by not showing up for meetings and having a bad attitude. He got an audience with Patriots coach Bill Belichick in New England, stepped on a scale weighing 220 pounds and never received an offer.

When he was visiting the Cardinals, he received a text. Abraham had taken in one of his troubled nephews, and the nephew had thrown a party at Abraham’s in Flowery Branch, Ga. — a “Project X” party, Abraham called it, referring to the motion picture. They threw a treadmill and television sets into the indoor pool, scattered his clothes and stole his memorabilia — including Pro Bowl mementos, game balls, signed jerseys and footballs from teammates, as well as his high school and college jerseys.

“My house was so lovely, right off Lake Lanier,” he says. “Loved that house. I had a nice little pond in the front. They destroyed it.”

Abraham had the house locked down and sold it.

The Cardinals took a chance on him and were rewarded with 11.5 sacks and Abraham made the Pro Bowl. But Abraham was partying more and feeling unstable emotionally. And if Atlanta was a city of eye-winking enablers, Phoenix had a bead on him wherever he went. He was warned by upper management that he was being watched.

Abraham loved Atlanta and never stopped calling it home.

“When he was cut by the Falcons, that broke his heart,” Worthy says. “Even though Arizona embraced him, he couldn’t get over his ex.”

In the summer of 2014, he was arrested in Georgia and charged with drunken driving after being found sleeping behind the wheel at an intersection. He missed nearly three weeks of training camp with the Cardinals while in rehab.

In the Cardinals’ first game of the 2014 season, Abraham’s head hit the hip of Chargers offensive tackle D.J. Fluker. The collision didn’t appear particularly violent, but Abraham lay on the ground face up for a time. It was a concussion and he eventually was told his brain was bleeding on both sides.

Abraham didn’t want to admit what he was feeling. He had been conditioned to play through concussion symptoms — if someone complained, he was being a “punk.” He says when he was with the Jets and told a coach his vision was blurred after a blow to the head, the coach accused him of faking.

He never played again after the first game of 2014, and he walked off the NFL stage without so much as a bow. Abraham wishes the end hadn’t come so abruptly. Already struggling with depression, he spiraled.

Abraham went into a nine-year fog, unable to see or think clearly.

“It literally felt I was always like this,” he says, closing his eyelids almost entirely.

He has scars on his fingers, knuckles and wrist. He isn’t sure how they got there. Some undoubtedly were from punching out car windows, which he did repeatedly when feeling claustrophobic.

Differentiating between dreams and reality was a challenge, and for many years, he continued to be a football player in his mind, uncontrollably. He would play an entire game in a dream, wake up and think he had to go to practice. He woke once to find nine slash marks in his mattress. Probably a bad dream, he figured. Some of his dreams were so vile. A bullet piercing his flesh. Falling from a rooftop. Death.

Abraham had a magnificent collection of blades — pocket knives, multi-tool knives, switchblades, hunting knives and even Samurai swords — more than 100 in total. They had to go.

In 2018, Abraham began contemplating ending it. He gave away many of his valuable possessions — watches, chains, clothes, cars — as if preparing to die. His condominium was on the 23rd floor, and he thought about jumping. “My heart would pump so hard,” he says. If he became too agitated, he would crawl under his bed, lock himself in his closet, sit in the lobby downstairs, or call 911 to have someone talk to him. Doctors warned Abraham that more head trauma could kill him. So he banged his head on walls or tables.

In Georgia, the 1013 law enables someone who fears they are a danger to themselves to initiate an involuntary mental health assessment. Worthy’s intention was to get 1013 help for the second time on July 31, 2020. She drove from Columbia to Atlanta and took him to Piedmont Hospital, where she dropped him off (she couldn’t accompany him because it was during the COVID-19 pandemic) and he told the staff he needed help. He says they weren’t very responsive. Anxious and frustrated, he walked out.

“I couldn’t see tomorrow,” he says. “It was pretty much over for me.”

In the drop-off area in front of the emergency room, a policeman stood with his back to him. Abraham approached the cop and reached for his gun, thinking the cop would beat him to it and kill him.

“He swung on me,” Abraham says. “I just fell back thinking he was going to shoot me, waiting for him to shoot. He didn’t shoot.”

Instead, the officer brought Abraham back into the hospital. As he lay in the bed, he made a vow — “Please, God,” he said, “help me with my mental health and I will not drink again.”

He was sent to Black Bear Lodge, an addiction treatment center in the foothills of northern Georgia. He stayed there for a month, thinking about wanting to kill himself. After being released, he wasn’t drinking, but he wasn’t in a good place. He isolated himself, didn’t shower and ate erratically.

Abraham agreed to spend a month in Colorado’s ski country at All Points North, a facility that focuses on treatment for mental health, addiction and trauma. It took two more month-long stays for him to connect with his therapist and embrace what was offered. Abraham learned to use dialectical behavior therapy to help regulate his emotions and cognitive behavioral therapy to identify and redirect negative thinking patterns. His depression and emotional swings were addressed with deep transcranial magnetic stimulation, which uses electrical impulses.

“That pretty much saved my life,” he says.

Socializing with old teammates can be awkward. They tell stories from their shared time, and Abraham usually doesn’t have much to contribute.

During his career, he studied the plays when he was blocked and beaten, and glossed over the ones that made fans leap from their seats and high-five strangers. Now, Abraham watches YouTube videos of his career to help him recall the kind of player he was.

“I had a lot of good days,” Abraham says. “I just can’t remember them.”

Others can.

“I thought he was an awesome player,” Hall of Fame offensive tackle Joe Thomas says. “He reminded me of DeMarcus Ware with his get-off and his short-area quickness.”

Sugar Bear Hamilton, who spent 36 years in the NFL as a player and coach, says Abraham was the quickest player he ever saw out of a two-point stance, and one of the best finishers on the quarterback.

“As a natural pass rusher, he was no doubt the best I was around,” Hamilton says. “He was right there with all those guys from that era, Bruce Smith, Chris Doleman, Jared Allen.”

Between the start of his career and the end, the only player with more sacks was Allen, who had one-half more. Abraham finished with one more sack than Lawrence Taylor.

“He was a fantastic player,” McKay says. “He had speed as well as power. He loved the game and was able to raise his performance in the fourth quarter. He played at the highest level on the biggest stage for a lot of years. It’s a credit to him despite all he faced.”

Panthers offensive tackle Jordan Gross says Abraham was as difficult to block as anyone he faced, while putting Julius Peppers in a separate category because he was bigger than the others.

Gross says other offensive tackles in the NFL often asked his advice before facing Abraham. They had a nickname for his hellacious bullrush — the “teleport,” they called it.

“You had to get out of your stance quickly because he had so much length and speed, so he would be two yards away from you running straight upfield, and then instantly he would teleport into a down-the-middle-of-your-chest bullrush,” Gross says. “It was one of the best bullrushes of anybody. I saw many offensive tackles end up on their backs because of that move.”

Thomas, Hamilton, McKay and Gross believe Abraham is worthy of induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He has never been a semifinalist.

Abraham has lofty desires — he wants to wear a gold jacket. And he has humble aspirations — he hopes his four daughters, Andrea, 24, Ayumi, 16, Jole, 9, and McKenzie, 1 1/2, are not embarrassed by him. And if by some grace they could be proud of him, his suffering would have been worthwhile.

“You know, it’s hard for me to be open about some things in my life,” he says. “I’m not the most comfortable with myself. But I’m talking about myself more for my kids. It’s not about me. I don’t want them to think they can’t overcome something.”

A while back, Abraham misplaced his wallet.

He wept. And wept and wept.

During the worst times, he lost phones almost weekly. He has a drawer full of credit cards, maybe 40 of them, that he left somewhere and had to cancel. When his wallet went missing, he had not lost anything in more than a year. It hurt to lose something again. But the episode was also a reminder of his progress. His prayer is that the crashing waves of his life are doing to him what the sea does to a jagged rock, making a polished stone.

Abraham still has moments. But he has the tools to fight through. He still sees his therapist from All Points North and uses dialectical and cognitive behavioral therapy. He practices mindfulness, which helps him focus.

Abraham believes he never had a problem with addiction, but he knows he shouldn’t drink. He says he has not been to a strip club in more than five years, and alcohol has not touched his lips since he reached for that cop’s gun and made that oath. Abraham has seen videos of drunk drivers, and he has been aghast. He thinks about how fortunate he was to have never injured anyone while driving after drinking.

His relationship with his mother is better, he says. Now they have open conversations about why she raised him the way she did. At 47, he still needs her love and approval.

“He has been a real upgoing man,” says Maggie Lee, who lives in a Timmonsville house he bought for her. “I can say he’s a true man. I’m proud for what he’s doing.”

He could point a finger at Maggie Lee.

Or at Man.

Or at that small town.

Or at anyone who ever handed him a shot.

Or at the concussion culture of his era.

Or at the NFL’s meat grinder.

Or at those leeches who took, took, took.

He won’t.

“I’ll take the responsibility,” he says.

Abraham is serving 120 hours of community service at the Atlanta Community Food Bank because of a 2018 obstruction charge for refusing to leave a taped-off area beneath where a person was threatening to jump. He packs and stacks boxes of food, cleans and tidies, and takes out the trash.

“You can tell he lives with a lot of regret,” Worthy says. “It’s hard for him to move forward, but he’s making progress.”

After he retired, Abraham withdrew from football — he couldn’t watch a game without breaking out in a sweat and feeling triggered. He’s finally comfortable being around the sport again. He has dabbled in broadcasting, made appearances for the Falcons and Jets and coached and mentored prospects in the NFL’s International Pathway Program.

In May, he wore a cap with a tassel, walked across a stage and extended a hand. He now holds a degree from the University of South Carolina in Liberal Studies, with an emphasis on psychology and sociology. His capstone project was on cognitive behavioral therapy.

Abraham is stretching himself — learning piano, juggling and sign language. He does car karaoke with his daughters — they sing Adele songs. He recently competed on two TV game shows, “Pictionary” and “Scrambled Up.”

“I want people to know I’m better, but not my best yet,” he says.

He is trying to envision his best. Perhaps it can happen in a place with less noise, congestion and danger.

He talks about trying to find that place.

If he does, everything could begin again for Abraham in a small town.

The first couple of months were so dreadful, I could barely function. By the 3rd month I had started to feel better but she reached out to give me the closure I asked for the month before. We FaceTimed and she told me she never felt like we were a good fit for each other and that in college she found other guys she was interested in. After our call ended she continued texting me why I wouldn’t admit we weren’t a good fit and I told her that if she wanted to work things out then she could message me otherwise I needed her to not reach out. Couple weeks later she texts me wishing me a happy birthday and thanksgiving, then another two weeks later she texts me randomly asking me what anime was it that I tried telling her we should watch. We engaged in conversation about what she and I had been up to, and it seemed good. But I started to feel like shit cause idk why she reached out again just to ask a random question like that, so a couple days after that conversation I asked her if we could grab a coffee and talk and she replied with “it was nice hearing from you, and im glad you’re doing well, but I don’t want to get back together” I replied to that with “okay that’s fine im just confused why you keep reaching out after I told you not to reach out unless you wanted to try again” to which she replied “alright, won’t happen again.” I’m angry and confused why she would do that to me. Like why couldn’t she have enough respect for me to leave me alone if she didn’t want me back? I clearly set a boundary and she ignored just to hurt me again. I keep trying to remind myself that she wasn’t good for me, she was very toxic during the relationship but yet I still miss her and wish that we could’ve worked things out. Atleast now I know 110% she won’t reach out anymore. But fuck i know by now I would’ve been feeling completely fine had she just left me alone, I feel like im right back to the beginning of the breakup. ",1,1766100215.0,BreakUps,1,0.67,False

1pq5gwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1pq5gwv/indefinite_rental/,Indefinite Rental,"I was terrified when I saw the body dangling by the neck in the garage.  It must have been there quite some time because it was almost unrecognizable, the neck stretching the already bloated face.  I was the first one back after Christmas break and I discover this.

I looked at my phone, there were dozens of texts, “Where are you?” from all my family.  I can’t deal with this right now.

I immediately ran out of the house to the police station.  After a brief wait an officer with blonde hair agreed to walk back to the house with me.  She wasn’t in uniform but had a white dress on.  Unusual for a police officer.

I lived in this Victorian house with rotating transients, druggies and students, so I didn’t know who the hanging victim was.  Goddamn I wanna get out of this house, in fact everyone does, but the rent is cheap and we just made it work.  The paranormal activity aside- which there was plenty- this will not help the situation.

One tenant who moved out quickly, claimed he saw a woman walk down the hallway and into a wall, clear as day.  We named her Helen for the sole reason there was a coffee mug with that name on it left in the kitchen pantry.

Eventually the body was removed, the other tenants returned, and after a house meeting, almost everyone said that they were going to move out.  Me being one.

One reason I hated it here is because my old friends all moved on long ago and I had no choice but to stay.  This depressed me to no end.  There were three floors in this house and most of the tenants were strangers to me.  We called this place the Krause House due to the owner’s name.  He was a strange cat indeed who lived on the roof of the house in a little hut.  He left us alone except to collect the rent and occasionally fix something.

Like clockwork, each tenant moved out during the following month. 

I didn’t know where I was going yet, but eventually I was the last one there, and damn it was creepy.

One night I was watching tv in the main room when I noticed a woman walk in.  She appeared very real, which made me jump up.  Was this Krause’s mother?  I knew she had a separate apartment on the side of the house.

“Hello dear, I am Helen.” she said.

“Hi, I am Sofia.” I replied.

“I know.  I was the one who tried to stop you.”

“Stop me?  From what?”

“Close your eyes and concentrate.  It’ll come to you.”

When I opened my eyes it was daytime, Helen was gone, but two men were emptying out my bedroom.

“Stop!  Who are you?” I screamed, but they didn’t hear me.

Then Helen walked up behind me, “Did it come to you yet, my dear?”

“Who died that night?” I asked her.

1pq5f26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pq5f26/aio_mum_keeps_throwing_away_any_food_i_make/,AIO mum keeps throwing away any food I make,"I'm graduating this summer and I work a part time job to get some money, so I'm fairly busy. My mum stopped cooking for the whole family almost a decade ago so I'm used to having to come up with something myself.

Now with how little time I have, I'll sometimes make 2 or 3 portions of a meal so I can have it for more than  a day. I put those in a container and into the fridge. My sister doesn't ever leave leftovers of her food, she throws those away, my dad doesn't cook, and my mum obviously knows what food she makes. It's happened several times now that I'll come home late, look in the fridge and my food is gone. By then my parents are asleep, if I actually make something that'd wake them up and they'd get mad at me. So I have to wait until the next day to even ask what happened to my food.

My mum will go, ""Oh I tried it, it wasn't good so I threw it away"".

I don't care if she doesn't like my cooking, she doesn't have to, it's not for her. I don't think it's unreasonable of me to not want the food I prepare wasted because she treats herself to it and doesn't like it, so throws all of it in the bin. 

Now last night I had a rough day at school and my boss on my ass at work. I come home at 9PM, cold, dark, just want to eat and go sleep. And my food is gone. I check the bin and guess what? There it is, right on top of the coffee grounds. 

I am mad at this point. So, I go back to the fridge and grab some of the food my mum made for herself and my dad. She works morning shifts, he works evening, so she prepares lunch the day before. I took some of it and ate it, because I was hungry and angry. 

Fast forward to today my mum is mad I ate it because she got less. I tell her she should stop throwing away my food and she says I need to not act this ""childish"". Admittedly I countered that stupidly with a ""How dare I eat"" . 

It does seem a little silly in hindsight. I'm just wondering now if that was an overreaction.",23,1766099845.0,AmIOverreacting,24,0.93,False

The evergreen crown of the trees weeps its leaves / It’s always the same oak-scented breeze / One leaf flew over my head like a joke I didn’t get / Like an easy riddle that I refuse to guess / That leaf was about to land on my shoulder / Unbeknownst to me, a delicate hand reached over / She snatched it and kept it in her pocket / I walked this river as if nothing had happened / How I regret not looking back; it’s that scene / She came out of nowhere; I was not aware

Your bittersweet, musky voice ripens my cheeks / You hum your sultry songs; I can’t speak / There was a word, and it was on the tip of my tongue / Your choice of glances and phrases, a lack thereof / I gun myself never to make you my muse / Yet I cannot be the only one squinting as you / Fly up; I’m barely learning how to / Swift off your flaming bronze feet; can you wait for me / I’m only here to embrace the storm you made / Seasons may change, but my reasons stay the same

Some air must have blown the dirt out of my eyes / I see you clearly; I want you to be mine / Some rising tides, flooding my doors / It's clear that there are signs, only that I am yours

1pq555n,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonmonogamy/comments/1pq555n/is_a_cuckold_relationships_realistic_long_term/,Is a cuckold relationships realistic long term,"Created a Reddit account just for this post. Feeling pretty heart broken at this point. Me and my long term boyfriend broke two months ago after cuckolding destroyed our relationship. 

I guess before diving in to all the back story my question is it realistic to have a real long term committed cuckold relationship?

Back story:

We were a perfectly normal couple with a perfectly normal sex life until he brought up his cuckolding fantasies. Initially I was totally against the idea and completely refused but after brought up several time in the next 2 years I decided what the hell and agreed to try it out. Secretly a guy I really liked a guy who just started at my office had been flirting with me. I told my boyfriend that I was ready to try it. Me and this guy from my office went on a few dates and he knew about my boyfriend. Eventually me and this guy slept together and I loved every minute of it and really enjoyed the freedom. I also met this guy at the gym and we slept together a few times. This lasted for about 3 months. I really enjoyed this freedom and instead of making feel cheap it made me feel incredibly confident, also it brought me my boyfriend really close and our relationship was so much more intimate in a really lovely way. It felt like the love was back in the relationship and we spent hours cuddling after I had been with another guy. My boyfriend was begging to watch me hook up with one of these guys. I really hated this idea and thought it was going to be really intense but eventually relented and so far the cuckolding has brought us much closer together. He watched for the first time and it all went well and we went home together after and he seemed so happy after and fell asleep in my arms as soon as we got home. I thought it was all going really well and let him watch again but with me and the guy from the gym. After about 15 minutes he rushed out of the room and I went to see what was wrong and I found him crying in the kitchen. I asked what was wrong but he didn’t want to talk about it. I sent the gym guy away and I told him we can talk and I was happy to stop if he changed his mind. He didn’t want to talk about it for the next few days but then he said he said he just found it too much and wanted to go back to how things were before. I said that it was totally fine but he stopped kissing me and became increasingly more distant which I found really frustrating. I tired to stay cool and give him time to come back around again but after 2 weeks of him barely touching or looking at me I snapped and we had a huge argument and he stormed out. He’s been staying at his parents place and we were barely speaking no matter how much I reached out. I secretly met the gym from the gym again just because I was feeling frustrated. I really regret doing this. Eventually my boyfriend replied to my texts and we agree to meet up for a coffee and he said he couldn’t see us working out after anymore. I gave him a few more weeks but he never wants to meet up and I only get really short blunt replies to my texts. 

I would be happy to go back to a normal relationship with him but also did really enjoy the freedom of cuckolding and would definitely enjoy it with another guy.

What can I do for to bring my boyfriend back and if I can’t have him back is having a cuckold relationship with another guy long term actually realistic?",5,1766099134.0,nonmonogamy,14,0.69,False
