1hvizsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1hvizsj/dry_january_is_an_interesting_experience_so_far/,Dry January is an interesting experience so far.,"All things considered, for a 22 year old man, I'm actually really enjoying it.

The first 3 or 4 days were, despite what I expected from internet accounts, very easy. I was more or less decompressing from holiday revelry in that time; the idea of indulging in alcohol felt like indulging in another cheese plate or yule log or roast beast— eugh.

I'm trying this ritual out because I noticed that alcohol was becoming a habit in my life- not something that I reach for in the name of celebration or social lubrication or relaxation, just something that's always there. It had become a very quick and easy response to things. Not even as a response to grief or sadness (not usually anyways), but a response to anything— boredom, idleness, firing up a movie or video game, it was something that was always appropriate. And as a result, by late November I was having at least a drink or two most nights, and by Christmas it was easily every night.

After a few days cold turkey, it wasn't until last night that I felt my first ""craving"" if you can call it that; a 20 minute period where I was thinking ""man, a cold Modelo would be the best damn thing in the world right now"" Food and soft drinks alleviated that pretty easily though. Tonight, the same thing- wanted a beer, ate a nice carb heavy dinner, and now the ""want"" is completed sated. Thank God I'm not trying to quit both sugar/carbs and booze at the same time.

A lot of people who write about their dry January experience talk about having a clearer mind and sharper memory, but I am not currently experiencing that (though it helps that I basically never get hangovers). I was expecting to experience some weight loss, but to be honest that doesn't seem likely either given my constant cravings for carbs and sugar that have amplified. And hey! Now that I'm tipsy 0/7 nights of the week, my evenings are much more free for me to work on my many unfinished projects.

I'm also drinking a f*ck ton of coffee. Like, I was a big coffee guy before, but I'm putting my new french press to serious work. I must have had 5 cups today and 6 yesterday. (Do they seriously cut you off of coffee in rehab??)

I don't want to compare my experience to people with *actual* substance abuse disorders. I also don't want to act like this is some hardship- it's really not. But it is eye opening to think that this 6 day stretch is possibly the longest I've gone without a drink in like two months. I definitely don't intend to give up drinking forever (Steam Whistle Pilsner tastes too damn good) but I get the feeling that once February 1st hits I'm going to have a very different relationship with booze than I did in 2024.

Any other dry January participants around here? If you're comfortable sharing, I would love to hear your approximate age— I have a current belief that Gen Z, Millenials, Gen X, and Boomers all have very different relationships with alcohol in our current cultural moment and maybe this thread could open a discussion on that.",2,1736222896.0,CasualConversation,0,1.0,False

The bright afternoon sun shines into my open office. Its 2:05PM I notice as I stare blankly at my Laptop.

""It's gone,"" says Fred, one of the senior DevOps engineers.

""What's gone?"" I ask.

""ALL OF IT,"" Fred replies.

I fire up Chrome and type `https://player.bigcorp.tv`. Nothing. A white background in small Monaco font reads: ""Server Error"". I press F12 and check developer tools. The status code column reads a singular 502. Our front-end is served from one service and the backend API, for which I am responsible, is served from another service. Using a terminal I check the backend with a curl command to see if I can hit publicly accessible data. Another 502. I quickly navigate to `https://internal.bigcorp.tv/status`, and see ""Server Error"" again. I type `https://internal.bigcorp.tv/status` into the location bar. Our internal status is also throwing the now familiar ""Server Error."" ""Where is Logan?"" I ask. ""He left for lunch,"" replies Fred.

We login to the root AWS account and start checking our super resilient, uncrashable Mesos infrastructure that was costing up to $100,000 a month. Mesos has worker nodes that require connection to the control plane nodes to operate. Fred explains that the control plane nodes, running on virtual machines, in AWS had been corrupted and rebuilt that morning. The reason our infrastructure was uncrashable was our lead DevOps engineer, Ryan, had extra control plane nodes running in Mesos itself. This self-hosted model allowed us to always spin up Mesos masters in such an event. The DevOps Manager, Logan, was away at lunch.

The control plane running in Mesos had split brained and was unable to take over the leader role when the AWS nodes were rebuilt. Fred had thought restarting them would quickly synchronize all the control plane nodes, and if anything was wrong we had backups of the control plane data. When this happened, unbeknownst to Fred, they lost the only good copy of the master data. Docker containers, if not mounted to a machine on their host, have ephemeral disk space. ""The last backup was 4 months ago,"" Fred informs me. ""Does Will know?"" I ask. Will is my boss and the Director of our Digital TV Product.

""IF THIS IS NOT UP IMMEDIATELY THEY ARE GOING TO FIRE ME AND ALL OF YOU,"" yells Will. As usual the concern of Will not earning income while his high profile attorney wife cucks him is first of his concerns. ""WHERE THE FUCK ARE LOGAN AND BRADEN?"" Braden is the mastermind of this Mesos Architecture, likely he could fix it, however, Braden is spending his vacation by visiting Burning Man for the first time. His boss Logan is MIA at lunch. Will gives Logan a call and informs him the entire platform is down for customers and every internal media management employee at the company.

2:45 PM.

Logan enters the office and scowls at me. Surprisingly, he walks straight to where the action is. I half-expected him to retreat to the DevOps room and tinker with his modular synthesizer letting everyone else clean up the mess. I've had multiple public fights with him about the cost of running this Mesos Frankenstein. My budget partially pays for the $100,000 a month infrastructure. ""The point of a container orchestration platform is to scale down so we can spend LESS money,"" I would scream after noting the bill had gone up more than 10x a month after migrating to his Mesos infrastructure. Now, despite how awesome the Mesos platform is, and how all my teams would love it, it is down.

By 4:00 PM afternoon bar patrons, I mean alcoholics, have been without bar TV almost 3 hours. The only thing Logan has accomplished is pacing nervously around the office and occasionally breathing stale, hungover breath into Fred's ear. The head of North America is now hovering, with Will my boss. Unfortunately the mobile and TV apps were crashing every time you tap or click the TV icon. Our platform provides digital TV to a European TV product. Europe is asleep by now, but the customers, and our European execs, will definitely start calling by morning. If you have never been yelled at by a German exec, its just as terrifying as old WW2 clips have you believe. Everyone looks increasingly nervous. ""We can just run the services on bare AWS without Mesos,"" I suggest.

Logan had finally made contact with Braden via text. He stated the Mesostein was in jeopardy and if they didn't fix it, he would certainly lose his job. Even though Braden had not slept the night before and may or may not have had pharmaceutical assistance with not sleeping he decided to hurriedly leave Burning Man and drive the 8 hours back to the office, targeting arrival before 11PM.

The backend is a simple Golang app which is easy to run with a single command. I demo to Will and the NA lead how I can route the DNS directly to the box via auto scaling groups, which gets us scaling out of the box. The database for the backend was not impacted and running in RDS, so this works, and we see TV show titles and M3U8 playlist URLs in a JSON blob. At 4:15 PM we have a strategy.

It didn't take long to get the front-end application running again, which was a simple node.js app. Hitting the staging URL the site was back-up, but not the internal management tools of it. At 5:15PM we shout ""HOORAY!"" The site is back up. Unfortunately, the service which serves the M3U8 playlists responsible for playing the video is a Java web-service, whose lead has just left the company. In parallel the video playout team had been trying to get the service running, but they are not familiar with the dark arts of Linux CLI and the AWS console. Fred and the DevOps team is still trying to jolt Frankenmesos back to life so they are of little help.

A new engineer on the video team frustrated with the verbosity and complexity of the service had built a skunk works project which generated M3U8 playlists for video. It was missing the advertising stitching capability, but it would play video if you pointed our video player at it without ads. We demoed this to Will. ""We can just change the M3U8 url in the database for the non-working video service to this service,"" we say. ""But its completely untested,"" Will says. ""Yeah but no video works, what do we have to lose?"", I reply. ""Fuck it,"" he says.

The next 4 hours we spent spinning up new services by hand on AWS running the video service with nohup after SSHing into them on public IP addresses. Around 7PM I receive a phone call from Braden. He tells me to check my text messages. I look and see a message he's sent with a picture. The picture contains a small BMW hatchback connected to a small UHaul. Both are totally destroyed, the contents of the UHaul are strewn about the highway complete with a bunny onesie and California mountains in the background.

Midnight.

We were now watching video on our player, streaming from a completely untested service. The database was updated with the new service URL just as our European customers started waking up to watch. The video team was now free to go home, and the DevOps team was directed to help them get the old video service running in the morning.

At 7 AM I arrive back in the office with a $5 pour over coffee in hand. The video team beat me there. They were still trying to save face and get their application working after being bested by a junior engineer and weekend project. Despite the panic of the previous day, they were close to getting back up and running.

I take the team and Fred out to a food truck lunch for take out. We pass Logan as we approach the second office building. ""I'm out,"" he says. ""Leaving already after yesterday?"" I ask, but shit like this isn't surprising for him. ""They fired me,"" he replies. ""I guess we will always have Mesos,"" I say. ""Hey, come over into my office,"" Will catches me offguard holding my Butter chicken, which is burning my hand, but soon to burn my asshole. ""How would you like to run the DevOps team as well?"" he says. ""Only if we can delete that hell spawn of an infrastructure,"" I reply.

1hviz8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelTrotters/comments/1hviz8g/safety_tips_for_solo_travelers/,Safety Tips for Solo Travelers,"Hey fellow Travel Trotters! 🌍 As someone who's navigated solo in over 50 countries, I've gathered a treasure trove of safety tips that have kept me (and others) safe on the road. Whether you're gearing up for your first solo adventure or you're a seasoned lone explorer, these insights will help you tread confidently and wisely on your journeys.

**Stay Connected, But Cautiously** 📱

Being connected is vital for safety, but there's an art to it. Always let a friend or family member know your itinerary, but stick to secure networks when updating them—public Wi-Fi can be a risky move. Apps like WhatsApp or Signal are great for instant check-ins without hefty fees. Personally, I always download offline maps and have an emergency contact numbers list ready. Remember, digital security is just as crucial as physical security.

**Trust Your Gut and Research Thoroughly** 🔍

Researching your destination is critical. Dive into forums and groups (like our awesome community here!) for tips from fellow travelers. I once altered my plans drastically after reading about safety concerns from fellow Reditiers, which was a potential trip-saver. Your intuition is powerful—if something feels off, it probably is. Trust it.

**Blend in With Confidence** 🎒

One trick for staying safe is to blend in with the locals. Learn a few key phrases of the local language, dress respectfully, and avoid flashing valuables. In Lisbon, I found that wearing a simple crossbody bag made me less of a target than my previous bulky backpack—lesson learned!

**Keep Your Essentials Close** 🏨

When lodging anywhere—from luxurious hotels to quaint hostels—use the room safe if available. I also travel with a portable lock for additional security. During a stay in Bangkok, this little gadget proved invaluable when my hostel safe malfunctioned.

**Transport Savvy** 🚕

Getting around safely involves a little strategy. Use reputable ridesharing apps like Uber or Lyft, and if you’re taking a taxi, ensuring they're registered with a local company is key. In cities like Berlin, I always hop into cabs with a company license displayed—reliable and stress-free.

**Engage With Caution** 🗣️

Part of the thrill of solo travel is meeting new people, but it’s wise to be a tad reserved with personal info at first. It's about striking that balance between openness and caution. I've shared many a coffee with charming locals in Italy, but I'm mindful about divulging details.

Security is a layered approach, incorporating common sense and proactive measures that suit your style and destinations. Share your tips or stories in the comments below! Let's keep our solo journeys safe and spectacular.

1hviz2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/memoriesicantforget/comments/1hviz2p/road_trip/,road trip :),My senior year of college me and my two roommates drove 22 hours straight from Wisconsin to South Carolina for spring break. We went to the national park there. It was flooded and wet. We camped there 2 or 3 nights I can’t remember now. We played games and ate soup and drank instant coffee and ate edibles. Then we got back in the car and drove a few hours to the great smoky mountains. We went hiking and built a fire and slept with hand warmers in our sleeping bags. No service on our phones. 3 girls in a car with a 30 hour playlist on Spotify and a tent with 3 sleeping bags. We drank wine and moonshine and smoked too much weed. We saw a waterfall and ate Mexican food in gatlinburg Tennessee. Our camping trip road trip extravaganza was the best spring break I had ever had. I’m out of college now. I see those girls every few months and it’s never long enough.

1hviyqx,https://i.redd.it/d4jumjksxhbe1.jpeg,✨ Gentle reminder: ask yourself “What’s in my cup?”,"Imagine you’re holding a cup of coffee when someone bumps into you or shakes your arm, causing the coffee to spill everywhere.

Why did you spill the coffee?
Most people would say, “Because someone bumped into me!”
But that’s not the real reason.

You spilled the coffee because coffee was what was in your cup.
If there had been tea in the cup, you would have spilled tea.
Whatever is inside the cup is what will come out when it’s shaken or jostled.

This analogy is a powerful reminder for life: When challenges come—and they will—what’s inside of us is what spills over. It’s easy to act calm and collected when everything is smooth, but when life shakes us, our true contents are revealed.

So, ask yourself: What’s in my cup?
When life gets tough, what spills out? Is it joy, gratitude, peace, and humility? Or is it anger, bitterness, resentment, and negativity?

Life provides the cup, but we choose what we fill it with.

Today, let’s focus on filling our cups with gratitude, forgiveness, patience, resilience, and positivity. Let’s make room for kindness, gentleness, and love—both for ourselves and for others. Because when life inevitably shakes us, let’s ensure what spills out is something that reflects the best of who we are.

The choice is always ours.",3,1736222801.0,selflove,1,1.0,False

1hvixkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frasier/comments/1hvixkg/in_praise_of_the_shows_very_first_season/,In praise of the show's very first season,"https://preview.redd.it/qcg0nl3jxhbe1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76f4d97af7a12321a13367a01fa7004694bd0059

Today, I finished the very first season of Frasier as part of my re-watching of the entire original series.  The twist is that I had started with season 2 and ended up finishing the whole series by watching season 1.  The reason for this is that about 7 months ago I stepped on a scale and decided I did not like what it told me.  I thought watching Frasier might help make the whole experience of riding an exercise bike a little more endurable.  I randomly started with season 2, not really believing I would stick with it, but 264 episodes and 20 pounds later, I proved myself wrong, I suppose.

Watching the first season after watching the last 10 first was a really interesting experience.  There was something so poignant about my 264-episode marathon ending with Frasier saying ""You know, in the greater scheme... yes, I'd say I am"" when asked if he was happy.  Aside from that, it really made me appreciate how good the first season is, both on its own and in relation to the rest of the show and other shows at the time.

Frasier as a sitcom really hit the ground running.  There is no ""early-seasons weirdness"" like with some shows, where the characters or their personalities or even the entire setup might be different.  The cast is there already, their personalities are fairly well-defined, and the show's set up is the same it would remain for 11 years.

I'm really impressed by how the producers and the writers knew what they wanted the show to be like and where they wanted to take it, right away.  From the very first episode, the dialogue is witty, the jokes are good, and there is so much heart.  There are so many episodes early on dedicated to letting us see who the characters are, what their values are, what motivates them, what drives them forward, and what holds them back.  I love that we get multiple episodes where Frasier's professional and personal ethics are tested, and that he doesn't just breeze past that for cheap laughs like in some of the later episodes.  I love the episode where he can't tell which one of Martin's poker buddies is an ex-con.  Frasier seems more human **and** more likeable in this first season.

In comparison with later season, I really enjoyed some of the lack of zaniness and episodes taking less-obvious turns.  In ""Death Becomes Him,"" it was refreshing to see him go to the shiva under false pretenses, but then fess up to it.  It's hard not to imagine an episode like that in season 9 devolving into a massive farce, where Frasier not only keeps pretending he was friends with the late doctor but probably also pretends to be Jewish because he blurts out that they went to Hebrew day school together when questioned on how he knew the deceased.  I also like the end of Fortysomething episode where he does actually go down to ask Carrie out but initially pretends like he didn't after she pre-emptively turns him down.  What I really like about that part is that he confesses to this completely unprompted.  There was nothing to gain and he didn't need to confess because the lie blew up in his face, as would often happen later on in the show's run.

And it's not as if the first season is completely devoid of the farce and the physical comedy of later years.  For all the heart, the show perhaps is less uproarious and less quotable the first dozen episodes, but even that picks up half way through the season.  Even if you don't think much of the first season, the trifecta of episodes that wrap up the season(Author, Author/Frasier Crane's Day Off/My Coffee with Niles) hold up really well when stacked against anything from later years.

I don't necessarily wanna say that by starting the show off with season 2 and making my way around the circle meant that I ""saved the best for last,"" but it really gave me a new appreciation of how good that debut season was.  I would say it easily beats season 11, but this may not be a popular opinion.  It was just such a great start to a show.  Any show.",2,1736222692.0,Frasier,1,1.0,False

1hvim1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntsvilleAlabama/comments/1hvim1i/madison_county_lake/,Madison County Lake,"If you are not aware,  Madison County has a public lake.  It is located near Gurley (https://maps.app.goo.gl/bxYPq3Ap2DU66HAt7).   If you like to fish and get outdoors, it's a great option.

The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR) announced some changes today to the public lakes in Alabama, and I thought I would post the letter here.

**Press release**  
**January 6, 2025**  
**Contact:** Jonathan Brown, (334) 242-3471  
  
**State Public Fishing Lakes Update for 2025**  
***Most lakes return to regular hours on February 1***  
  
Most of Alabama’s 23 State-owned Public Fishing Lakes return to regular operational hours on Saturday, February 1, 2025. Located throughout the state, these lakes are noted for their quality fishing for bream, largemouth bass, channel catfish and crappie (in most lakes). Because these smaller lakes warm more quickly than larger bodies of water, early spring fishing can be excellent.  
  
“Many state lakes have been renovated in recent years and some lakes are closed for repairs and restocking,” said Jonathan Brown, State Lakes Supervisor for the Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries (WFF) Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR). “Improvements will continue throughout our public fishing lake system in 2025. We encourage all Alabamians to visit one of these lakes this year and share that experience with family and friends.”  
  
Changes coming to ADCNR’s State Public Fishing Lakes for 2025 include an operational change during the summer months and a price change for daily fishing permits and boat rentals.  
  
To allow the lake managers more time to perform grounds maintenance and restock concessions, ADCNR has approved an additional closed day for the lakes from July 1 through October 31. All State Public Fishing Lakes will remain open Thursday through Sunday each week. The extra closed day is at the discretion of the lake manager but will take place between Monday and Wednesday. Anglers should call their district fisheries office or the individual lakes for the operational schedule when planning their fishing trip.  
  
Also new for 2025, the price of fishing permits for the lakes will increase from $3 to $5, and the price of boat rentals will increase from $5 to $10. There is no longer a fee for launching angler-owned fishing boats. Fishing licenses and permits are available from license agents located throughout the state, online at [www.outdooralabama.com](https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.outdooralabama.com%2F/1/010001943c623796-a30b0821-4916-4a9f-983d-908df80550a7-000000/ZGdcjEFAuAl27Vs7cwp06jAg6k4LJfmDNjwAC9xI4t4=386), through the Outdoor AL mobile app, at local county probate offices or by phone at (888) 848-6887. Processing and convenience fees may apply.  
  
Barbour, Coffee, Crenshaw, Escambia, Marion and Washington county lakes are currently closed for renovations. Bibb County Lake is expected to reopen sometime during the spring of 2025 under the operation of a new lake manager. Chambers County Lake was recently renovated and will reopen on February 1, 2025.  
  
The WFF Fisheries Section carefully stocks and manages the lakes for optimum fishing. The lakes are also fertilized to maximize fish production and fishing piers allow anglers easy access to deeper water. In addition to traditional freshwater game species such as largemouth bass and crappie, WFF also stocks rainbow trout in select lakes.  
  
In addition to fishing, some state fishing lakes offer additional outdoor recreational opportunities. Pike County Lake in Troy, Dale County Lake in Ozark and Walker County Lake in Jasper feature community archery parks and walking trails that are open to the public year-round. Walker County Lake also features a birdwatching tower.  
  
For more information, contact your local WFF Fisheries Section District Office: District 1 in Tanner, (256) 353-2634; District 2 in Eastaboga, (256) 831-6860; District 3 in Northport, (205) 339-5716; District 4 in Enterprise, (334) 347-9467; District 5 in Spanish Fort, (251) 626-5153.

1hvil1q,https://v.redd.it/jzyikyd5uhbe1,How to get smoother espresso flow from bottomless filter basket,"Hello! This is a question from my boyfriend as for some reason he wasn't able to upload the video on his account.

Thank you for everyone who helped up last time with the extraction rate.

We bought Gaggia E24 a few months ago and I’ve been dialing in to get a smooth espresso shot. However the espresso seems to be too watery so I am wondering what can be done to improve the shot. I've attached a video of the extraction.

My espresso equipment:
Gaggia E24
Fellow opus grinder
Dark roast coffee beans
Barista pro nanotech precision 20g basket
WDT
Namcore spring loaded tamper
Namcore 1.7mm pack screen

My assumption on the issue:

Coffee grind not fine enough?- I’ve tried to extract with finer ground and it took too long to be extracted and it tasted awful. I’m assuming if I put less coffee ground with finer grind setting, it will balance out?

Pre-infusion might help?

* **Urban Pie / Vibe** \- when you sign up for their rewards program, you get $10 to spend any way you wish for up to a month.  Since they're owned or operated by the same person, the reward can be used either at Urban Pie or The Vibe Coffee & Ice Cream shop.
* **Jimmy John's** \- free original sub or wrap to use within a month (could be upwards of a $9 value depending on what you end up redeeming, but has to be done within their app and you need to click on the link that arrives in your email to load it up into your account).
* **Longhorn / Olive Garden** \- both give you a free dessert up to I think a $12.99 value.  Their e-club will send you an email with a code, however the servers will tell you it's not actually needed.  
* **Brass Tap** \- $5 off your order; use within a month.
* **Pizza Ranch** \- $5 of your order; use within 30 days
* **Marcus Theater** \- free large popcorn (not sure on price but at the theater that's probably like $10); need to use within 30 days of your birthday.
* **Brown Bottle (Cedar Falls)** \- Brownie Pie, although I don't like that so they'll offer an ice cream sundae for free with chocolate syrup, whipped cream and a cherry.  Not sure if the. Waterloo location does anything for free beyond the Brownie Pie.  
* **Papa Murphy's** \- free pizza of any size up to $16 (if you order a pizza that's more than $16, you pay the additional amount); need to use within 30 days of your birthday.
* **Pita Pit** \- free pita (probably close to a $10 value); use within your birthday month.
* **Chilito's** \- Fried Ice cream (normally I don't like, but theirs is actually real good; went to the Waterloo location which is my favorite Chilto's location).  Not sure of the cost, but guessing $8 or more value.  They don't have an e-club, but will give you this if it's your birthday

Hello, so I've been out of the dating game for over 5 years, no matches that led to dates or anything more than a few messages, and overall just kind of been focusing on my kid and myself (33m). 

About mid year-ish 24' I matched with this single mom (32f) on hinge from the town over and we messaged for like a day and a half. But then I didn't hear anything for a few days after that. I just ended up just unmatching and getting rid of the apps. Kept busy at work etc and about end of last year I started to focus on trying to find someone again. I ended up making one of those Facebook dating and got a match request from the same single mom from hinge.

I messaged her throwing a slight jab lol ""aren't you the one who ghosted me on hinge a while back?"" She just said, sorry that her ADHD makes her forget to message back and shes a known to be bad at texting back and she has people who'll vouch on how bad she is. We ended up chatting for a couple of days, messages were engaging on both ends, nothing short or off putting. We ended up grabbing a coffee since that fit into our schedules and everything went well imo. Lots of laughter, good talks, I paid for our drinks, nothing out of the norm. We exchanged numbers and texted a bunch the following days,and I even got called handsome... Mighty big word might I say lmao.

At one point it might've been like 2 days that she didn't text back, I know she said she had her mother staying at her place for xmas and her sister was coming into town also (mentioned during coffee). No biggie, I just sent a simple text saying happy holidays hope everything goes smoothly at her place etc. She responded but then after that nothing for over a week now. 

One of my female friends says that I should message her something simple just like hope your doing well or something along those lines. But then all I'm reading online is just like cut your losses. Idk... Like from being a parent I understand life gets busy and plus she had her family for the holidays. We're both in our early 30's if that makes any difference.

Long rant ahead. And please don’t share on other platforms kasi specific yung mga events na shinare ko.

I [22/F] have this one bestfriend [22/F] for 7 years na. We met during high school then separate schools for SHS and college. At first, di naman bother sa aming dalawa na iba yung schools namin and iba rin yung paths namin in life. Nung nag-uusap kami regarding future plans, same kami ng plans like same course and planning to go to the same schools. Pero di pumayag parents niya so nag-iba siya ng plans at sumunod sa decisions on what course she would take and kung saang school. Hindi ko gets yung part na yon pero pinrocess ko nalang siya as iba kami ng family situation and baka may plans na yung parents niya for her. 

New school, new environment, so nagkaroon kami ng other friends and siyempre, iba na rin yung mga hangouts na pinupuntahan namin. Nagworry ako kasi may time na super late na tapos kinausap ako nung isang classmate niya asking for help kasi lasing raw siya and di nila alam kung paano siya iuuwi. Di rin alam ng parents niya na umiinom at naglalasing siya with classmates kaya di nila mahahatid. As much as I want to sundo her non, nasa Manila ako at that time and near midnight na yon and di ko rin alam kung nasaan siya. Somehow, nahimasmasan at nakauwi siya mag-isa nung time na yon.

Pero we acknowledge each other as best friends pa rin. Sabi namin both na it’s fine naman and maybe lowkey friendship kami. Yung minsan lang mag-usap and/or magkita pero close pa rin. 

Soon enough, parang ang hirap ko na siyang makausap kahit through chats and mas lalo na magset ng hangouts na kahit once a year lang. It takes 5-15 minutes yung pinakamabilis na reply niya and sometimes half a day pa bago siya magreply (if magrereply siya). SHS palang kami, ganyan na and it even got worst nung college na umaabot kami ng ilang months of no communication. And, I still waited and tried to be understanding. Admittedly, busy ako and minsan lang ako umuuwi ng province. Then, I would see her with her other friends na she makes time to see and even some na mutual friends namin back in high school. So parang napapaisip ako na, bakit sa akin hindi siya ganon? Mahirap ba mangamusta or vidcall? Or try man lang magset ng coffee hangout? Honestly speaking, naging bitter ako to see yung mga IG stories niya so I ended up softblocking then unfollowing her. Multiple times rin na I restricted her on messenger pero medj tanga rin ako kasi chinecheck ko pa rin multiple times a day yung chat niya, baka sakaling may message siya. I told her this nung nagmeet kami once last year. Sabi ko kasi nagtatampo ako na hindi kami nag-uusap and nagkikita. Naacknowledge naman niya ‘yon pero later on, bumalik sa low-to-no contact kami. Edi nagrestrict-and-unrestrict nanaman ako. 

So, antagal naming hindi nag-uusap. 

Recently, pareho kaming nag-graduate from college and I thought na things would get better between the both of us. However, parang mas naging worst? I started reviewing for the board exams after graduation tapos sinabay ko na rin mag-effort in reaching out sa kanya. Yung wala na nga ako halos time for myself tapos para pa akong naghihintay sa wala sa mga message niya— I got so burned out in everything non. Kaya I decided na magfocus na muna ako sa review then I will put extra effort after the board exams. 

Nakapagboard exam na ako, nagreach out ako sa kanya—ganun pa rin. Actually, funnily enough— hindi niya alam na I already took the boards and nalaman niya lang na I passed kasi nagchange ako ng profile picture sa Facebook. Edi bumalik pagiging bitter ko ng full force kasi nung yung isang friend namin nagka-certification— ang oa nung post niya sa IG stories tapos may hangout pa after ah. Since napakilala ko na siya sa family ko, sinuggest ng mom ko na iinvite siya sa mini celebration— a choice between eating out or maghahanda nalang sa bahay, and I chose the latter para mas mahaba yung hangout namin non. Nag-agree siya and sakto pang uuwi siya sa province namin at that time and siya pa nagset na lunch siya pupunta sa bahay namin. Dumating yung day, morning palang nagmessage na ako sa kanya to remind her about the handa sa bahay namin— may history kasi siya na late dumadating sa lahat ng bagay, simpleng kita sa mall umaabot ako ng 2+ hours mag-antay sa kanya kahit kanto lang ng subdivision niya yung mall. Nagmessage siya sa akin ng bandang 11am ng ‘good morning kakagising ko palang hahah’ bago ako sabihan na may pupuntahan pa muna sila nung parents niya before siya ihatid sa amin. Medj malayo yung place pero I thought na ‘ay baka late lunch bet niya, may mga ganung person naman’ pero dumating na yung 5pm, wala pa rin. Mind you, di pa ako kumakain at this time kasi balak ko sabay kaming kumain. Pinilit na ako ng mom ko kumain kasi may history ako of fainting if di kumakain on time— a fact na alam ng friend ko rin. Hanggang sa nainis na ako, around 6pm and told her na  wag na siyang pumunta kasi wala ng handa. Sabi niya sa akin, ‘ay plan ko na sabihin sa parents ko na ihatid ako diyan pagkauwi namin’ and then nothing more. As in wala na follow up after niyan. 

A few days later, sabi niya sa akin na i-free up ko yung sched ko before Christmas kasi magkikita kami ng other HS friends namin. I agreed, andami kong niresched na hangouts and errands for that. Day before, nagfollow up ako regarding the details like anong oras kami magkikita and kung saan magkikita. Late night na siya nagreply, mga around midnight, and wala pa raw details. Send niya nalang sa akin ganon. So natulog na ako and I planned to wake up early nalang para kahit anong oras niya i-set I can go agad. 5am ako nagising, no plans. 12nn nagmessage siya na kakagising niya palang and di na avail yung isang friend namin. Then, nothing more. 

Next message niya sa akin, Merry Christmas. Di na ako nag-greet kasi super sama ng loob ko sa kanya. Parang sa ilang years ng friendship namin, lagi akong naghihintay sa kanya. Naghihintay na magreply siya. Naghihintay na dumating siya sa gala. Naghihintay ng greetings.

So, nagculminate ata lahat ng feelings ko nung Jan 1. After ng NYE party ng family ko, nag-inuman kami ng mga cousins ko until 6am ng Jan 1. Nagulat nalang ako nung pagkagising ko na I tried calling her on messenger and sent her a voice message. Pinakinggan ko yung vm ko and it started with “Happy New Year. Fuck you—“ tapos I blabbered about me giving up our friendship na. I unsent it in case na di niya pa napapakinggan. Later on that day, nagsend siya ng reply: do you mean it? kaya pala di ka nag-greet nung Christmas. happy new year. 

Wala na akong maggagawa kasi napakinggan niya na. So nagreply nalang ako na, if free siya and icall niya ako so I can explain— ito na yung magiging final effort ko on our friendship. If ayaw niya to hear me out, okay nalang rin yon sa akin. Hanggang ngayon wala siyang message sa akin or call. So I guess wala na talaga yung 7 years friendship namin no? 

Pero, napapaisip ako if gago ba ako na di ko personal sinabi sa kanya lahat ito and na parang sinuko ko na yung friendship namin nung New Years. Dapat ba ako nalang yung magreach out ulit sa kanya? ",1,1736220826.0,AkoBaYungGago,0,1.0,False

Snowboarding, travelling, road trips, parties, beach hangs, pool days, events, live music, concerts, birthdays, gym/training, teaching eachother languages and many more...

I'm down to try anything once except skydiving.
Other than that I'll be your +1.

A little bit about me:
I'm latino, I love to read, my sense of humor is dark, I like to listen (so you better like to talk), I've been hurt pretty badly so please don't ttm unless you have good intentions, I look like an average guy.

If you like the show superstore, we can bond over that. If you've read anything by Elkhart tolle, I'll be very impressed. If you read anything other than self help books, you need help. But I'll gladly hear your recommendations.

I need someone I can call at 4 am who will answer my call, who wants the same from me. A ride or die, Bonnieand Clyde, the real deal.

Respond with your most embarrassing moment thus far in your life. I'll respond with mine. I bet mines funnier, but if yours is I'll buy you a bottle of wine.",2,1736220561.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,2,1.0,False

Every chance I get, I tell people that El Paso is a hidden gem and they should visit. 

Back when I lived in El Paso my perfect Saturday consisted of a morning workout class, getting iced coffee from a local coffee shop or getting a smoothie from Tippie Teas, walking around Kern while listening to a good podcast (Giggly Squad!). I then would go home and relax. Later in the night, I’d go to a nice dinner, walk around downtown, watch a movie at the Alamo Drafthouse, and finish the night at Scenic Drive admiring the city. 

I’m curious to know, what is your perfect Saturday living in the city?

Sorry for the rambling, I'm just in a bit of a slump/funk, anyone wanna chat about nothing and everything ? How's 2025 going for you so far ?","Hi, nearly 31 year old male from Australia here. Just in a new years slump, actually, been a few months now. Life is in slow motion. I work, I sleep, I eat, I do life admin shit, and then the next day appears. 

I've been really lazy lately. Not sure what I'm looking for. Maybe just an ear to complain to, or someone to talk to. I need to get back into the gym and pursuing my hobbies. Easier said than done. 

Life is getting a bit stale post 30 years old. Maybe I'm just disillusioned.

What's the last book you read cover to cover? I used to read a lot in highschool. I think mine was 'The Old Man and The Sea' by Ernest Hemingway in 2021. It wasn't too long, maybe took me a week or two to finish. I want to start reading novels again. I have a stack of books that are gathering dust. I am generally aimless when it comes to life. Recently I've been feeling very listless, a bit bored, and despondent of things in general and I don't know why. 

A bit about me: 

* I prefer tea over coffee first thing in the morning.
* I hate running but at one point in time I could do a sub 25 min 5K. I am now severely unfit.
* I have two degrees in the hard sciences but now work in IT.
* I want to produce music one day, mainly house/electronic/EDM. But mainly house music. 
* I have a hard time keeping myself accountable to myself. Hit me up if you're looking for an accountability partner.
* I have a prominent scar on the back of my right hand.

A bit about you:

* Somewhat disillusioned with life (just like me !)
* Male or female, I really don't mind !
*  Similar timezone to me would be nice :) I am in GMT+10
* A love for music and the arts would be appreciated

I am happy to trade pictures of myself and eventually move to another platform like Signal or WhatsApp. Also just to point out - I am NOT looking for anything nsfw or any lewd chats.

• **MAC Creme in Your Coffee (Macximal)** - A pink brown nude with a *tiny* hint of red? I used to have the OG Creme in Your Coffee, that one was neutral but bordered on cool and didn’t look very flattering on me. The Macximal version is definitely warmer toned but still neutral.

• **Dior 300 Nude Style Velvet** - A neutral pink brown nude that turns a bit deeper after it sets. Has the most brown among these four.

• **Lisa Eldridge Ashes of Roses** - A neutral (bordering on warm) pink brown nude. It’s the lightest and warmest shade in the bunch but still definitely in neutral territory. On me, this is the most natural-looking MLBB among these four and looks flattering in every lighting.

• **MAC Over the Taupe** - The most muted shade in this list. This is like if Dior 300 Nude Style is lighter/had less brown in it.

I am 27 and began my TRT journey December 9th. I am a 4 year veteran athlete who’s always made fitness a priority. Im currently a full time student working on a full time side hustle. My schedule is loaded and I wake up at 5am everyday and go to bed around 10-11pmish. I’ve always been very busy but this past year I had notice my energy levels crashing HARD. I was having to rely some days on 2 cups of coffee, an energy drink, and pre workout all in one day to keep me going, without these id crash so hard around the afternoon. It was also almost impossible for me to make gains in the gym. I’m known to have a really high metabolism and could eat like shit for a week and somehow manage to lose 5lbs at the end of it. I was really plateauing hard, and it was incredibly difficult for me to enforce progressive overload, as I would struggle and have to use lower weights during my workouts. I ended up getting my blood work tested at the VA in May and my total testosterone came back as 108. I made sure I started prioritizing my sleep and fitness until December, and was still on the lower end, peaking at 475. My VA doctor recommended me to begin TRT therapy and I just got my 5th injection today. I am currently taking 120mg of Testosterone cypionate. Overall, my productivity and energy levels have gotten better and my overall mood and confidence has increased. I haven’t missed a day in the gym since starting and I am now able to lift heavier each week. I wouldn’t say I feel AMAZING yet, and I’m doing weekly injections and start feeling a crash around Fridays (Mondays are my injection days), but overall I feel way better than I did before starting. I know I’m pretty young to start, but it’s been such a battle to fight my low energy levels, especially with how much I have going on, and with how productive I’ve been this past month I’d rather work as hard as I can now with a solution to my testosterone deficiency. I go to get my blood levels checked at the end of the month and will update you guys then where I am at, and will let you know if I will be adjusting my dosage.

The pain, numbness, and tingling started in my arms/hands and has progressively worked its way up to my neck.  I noticed my symptoms got much worse when I upped my caffeine intake and started taking ADHD medicine (I’m newish Dad and New job). The burning pain got significantly worse out of nowhere, I figured it was connected to something specific. Eventually I narrowed it down to my ADHD medicine (caffeine as well but my meds made it much worse). I was able to test this by stopping my meds for awhile and then taking them again to see if the burning pain came back. Caffeine does this to me as well but it’s more of a threshold, like if I go consecutive days drinking a cold brew for example. I went ahead and cut out these substances completely for the most part (other than coffee here and there…I just can’t do it permanently) and my flare ups have settled down. My point of making this post was to see if this happens to anyone else and also as a PSA for something to maybe look out for. Appreciate any comments in advance!

- MHW-3Bomber Tamper,

- MHW 3Bomber Portafilter Puck


Now I saw alot of people talking about changing the portafilter to a bottomless one, but I have no idea if I should do that from the beginning or use the stock one first.

Optional:
-MHW 3Bomber bottomless Portafilter (35)

If I would go for the bottomless Portafilter, is a 15g basket enough? I see alot of posts where 18g seems to be the average amount.

As you can see my budget is kinda low for this rabbithole. I am never going to be extremely enthusiastic about brewing coffee. I just want to make a good Cappuccino.

If you wonder about the pricing, I live in switzerland. Also availability of Accessoires is a bit cumbersome here...

Please let me you what you think!

I used to drink several coffees and energy drinks to survive when I used to schedule 9 in a day (horrible idea) and have cut out energy drinks while I work less. 
I caved and had a 5 hour energy drink and felt like my brain was on fire. 
Nope, back to just coffee.

Anyone else have a similar experience where when they worked too much had to supplement but then stopped doing both? 

I’m just trying to lean into self care and working too much and drinking 1,000 mg of caffeine a day ain’t that ",2,1736218671.0,therapists,3,0.75,False

I am a lesbian girl and my best friend is a pan girl. We are both minors, and all consent to telling this story is clear. 
Me and her, who let's call Might, we're playing Roblox. We decided to try out a prett basic RP game. The name will be disclosed to not paint the game in a bad way. He gave her boba randomly. This is how the conversation between them started: 
Her: Hi thanks for the boba 
Him: Anytime, where r u? 
Her: Library 
Him: I'm going there 
Him: You look nice? 
Him: Brb
*mini time skip* 
Him: Hey 
Her: Hi 
Him: I'm back, sorry for the hold 
Her: Nice, it's okay 
Him: Where r u? *repeated two more times* 
Her: walking outside 
Her: I'm at the coffee shop 
Him: Okay, I'm going there 
Him: where r u 
Him: let's go to my place 
Her: okay 
Him: so how old are you IRL? 
Him: I'm 14 
Him: Hello? 
Her: 13 
Him: oh
Him: you sure? 
Her: yes 
Him: okay I trust you, change clothes
Her: what 
Him: wanna change clothes? 
Her: idk 
Him: D I D D Y 
Her: ??? 
Him: nvm 
Him: I live in Houston, btw
You? 
Her: Me too 
Him: I live in Spring though 
Her: okay
Him: you? 
Her: Sienna
Him: oh 
You go to middle school right? 
Her: yes 
Him: btw you have ggyat 
So you wanna do it? *he's standing on the bed* 
Her: Do what? *playing dumb* 
Him: Um, nvm 
*A lot of tags*
Him: Dang it 
Her: what 
Him: im trying to spell something but it keeps on blurring it 
Her: Okay 
Him: What's your race 
Her: white 
Him: sheesh, okay okay 
Her: ??? 
Him: do you have curly hair 
Her: no 
Him: oh 
That's not the full conversation, since the rest is kinda weird. But it continues with him asking her weird questions. All of her answers are LIES btw, she's not stupid. The rest is him trying to say the actual harassment and more, with him picking her up(Night accepted bc she misclicked and this was our first time playing the game, so she didn't know how to get down) and placing her on the bed. When he tried to make a move, we left. But that guy is a STALKER I SWEAR. And he tried to friend her. She says she won't make an alt account, bc it would be to much work with all her levels and stuff ect ect. So what should we do? ",2,1736218567.0,SexualHarassment,0,1.0,False

Here are some tips and tricks that worked for me. Since we had an Amazon Prime account and get free returns I had on hand: bedside commode that could also be placed over the toilet, circulating ice machine, female urinal bottle, 7 piece hip kit, adult size wet wipes, foam wedge for elevating leg and a body pillow. I didn't need the bedside commode because I  could walk to the toilet with the walker and then, use the walker for raising and lowering myself (just pull it in close to you) on and off the toilet. I didn't need the urinal bottle or hip kit so will be returning all those things. Since I had an anterior approach, I could bend enough to put my own socks on or pick things off the floor. I was very flexible to start with from Yoga. I used my cane to raise and lower my surgical leg in and out of the bed for the first couple of days. Then, I could use my good leg to do it. I used the foam wedge for elevating during the day and the body pillow for sleeping on my non-surgical side at night. However, I should have only bought the body pillow because I could fold it in half and it was the same height and size as the wedge. The ice machine was really nice but if it hadn't been a gift, I wouldn't have gotten it. I'd have just bought 3 of the 8 hr. gel packs (medium size) and rotate them through the freezer. I had a home health PT come twice a week and since he said to get up and walk every hour, I'd get my own ice, coffee, drinks, (we did the monthly freezer meals already), walk to the bathroom etc. I had a cloth shopping bag attached to my walker. I did start taking Miralax on day 5 since I hadn't had a bowel movement. I was worried it would make my stools too watery and make me have to rush to the toilet but it actually didn't do either. It made everything normal. Today, my PT okayed me switching from the walker to the cane. I didn't need the walker for actually walking after day 3 but used it to prevent falls and because my PT wanted me to walk as normally as possible. He said he didn't want me developing any bad walking habits. I'm really exhausted most of the time so spend most of my day sleeping. I've only needed the stronger pain meds (hydrocodone) once a day in the evenings, 600mg of ibuprofen works for me the other times. Feel free to ask me any questions for those of you having your replacement coming up. ",6,1736218511.0,TotalHipReplacement,1,1.0,False

That question, right there, is like a punch to the gut for many of us. You're juggling a million things, the daily grind of running a business, and now someone is saying you need to become an AI expert on top of everything else? It feels impossible, maybe even a little insulting, to be honest. Where do we even begin to carve out those extra hours?

I get it, completely. The world is buzzing about AI and how it can revolutionize your business, but it’s hard to see that potential when you’re barely keeping your head above water. You’re not alone; many of us feel like we're running in place.

It has never been easier to master Ai-powered solutions for small business success than it is today! The idea of mastering a new tool, especially one that feels as complex as AI, is daunting when your to-do list has suddenly become longer than a grocery list. It’s not just about the time commitment, it’s the mental energy, the frustration of learning a new language, and the feeling that you're falling behind if you don't grasp it all instantly. We've all been there, staring at the screen, wondering if we accidentally signed up for a PhD program instead of just trying to grow a business. It’s easy to throw your hands up and think, “I’ll just keep doing things the way I always have.”

But what if there was a way to leverage the power of AI without dedicating your life to it?

# Effortless Lead Generation: How AI Automates and Optimizes Your Sales Funnel

That’s where tools like Sparky AI come into play, and it's not about *becoming* an AI expert; it’s about having one in your corner. Think of Sparky as your tireless assistant, the one who doesn’t need coffee breaks and doesn't get phased by a rude customer. Sparky AI is designed to handle the time-consuming tasks that often bog us down, like lead generation and follow-up, so you can focus on the core of your business. AI **automates lead generation** by reaching out to leads via phone, text, email, and even social media to make those initial connections and does not stop until it receives a response.

For many of us, those initial calls and follow-ups can be the hardest part, and Sparky’s there to take that off your plate, utilizing something that’s already set up and ready to go.

* **Personalized communication**: Sparky uses personalized messages based on an individual's online activity and continues the conversation through follow-up messages that are not robotic but sound like a real person. This kind of personalization means you’re not just throwing out generic messages and hoping someone bites; instead, you’re engaging in meaningful ways with potential customers.

# Reclaiming Your Time: Leveraging AI to Focus on Business Strategy and Innovation

Now, you might be thinking this is too good to be true. I mean, how can an AI understand your business like you do? The beauty of it is that Sparky doesn’t *replace* you; it *supports* you. It's there to handle the repetitive tasks while you bring the personal touch, the creativity, and the strategy to your business.

You're still the captain of the ship, Sparky is just helping you navigate the waters more efficiently. And if you want to add your own spin, you can integrate your own programs into the system as well.

* **Pro Tip**: Use AI to handle mundane tasks, allowing you to focus on strategic planning and innovation. This is how you work **""smarter, not harder""**

One of the most incredible aspects of Sparky is that it’s constantly working and learning. If a lead gets nasty, Sparky just keeps going, doesn’t get offended, and moves on to the next one. No more agonizing over rejections or feeling burnt out. It keeps the conversation going, follows up, and nurtures your leads while you’re sleeping. That’s because Sparky uses retargeting and a natural language process to stay top of mind and move the lead along in the sales process. Plus, it's set up to help people sign up quickly, without a lot of technical know-how.

It really is a “set it and forget it” approach to lead generation, freeing up your time to work *on* your business instead of constantly *in* your business.

# Global Expansion Made Easy: Using AI to Connect with International Markets

And let’s not forget the potential for growth. Sparky can help you expand your reach by connecting with people all over the world in multiple languages. If you’re ready to supercharge your lead generation, Sparky offers different ad packages to connect with more leads. You can even earn a commission if a team member purchases one of these packages. It is even possible to add multiple income streams into the system and have Sparky promote all of your opportunities.

Using AI for global business expansion is not just a dream - it's a reality with tools like Sparky.

So, how do you find the time? The truth is, you don’t *make* the time; you *reclaim* it. You use tools like Sparky to do what technology does best - handle the tedious, time-consuming stuff while you do what you do best—market and grow a business. Maybe it's time to stop feeling like you need to be an expert in *everything* and start leveraging the power of AI to lighten your load and grow your business.

* **Pro Tip**: Focus on business strategy and innovation by letting AI handle the repetitive tasks.

It's about recognizing that your time is valuable, and there are ways to get things done without sacrificing your sanity. When you look at it that way, it becomes less about ""finding the time"" and more about making the *best* use of the time you *have*. It’s a shift in perspective, a leap into the potential that lies within the tech around us, and how that tech can elevate your efforts.

The future isn’t about us competing with AI, it’s about us working with AI to create a reality that would never have been possible on our own.

Harnessing AI for small business success is not just a buzzword, it's a pathway to reclaiming your time and focusing on what truly matters. Embrace the change, and let AI be your partner in growth.

In Summary🌟

1. **Effortless Lead Generation**: Sparky automates and presents a ready made sales funnel, handling repetitive tasks like reaching out to potential customers and converting leads, while maintaining personalized communication.
2. **Reclaiming Your Time**: Sparky takes over mundane tasks, allowing business owners to focus on strategic planning and innovation, emphasizing the importance of working on the business rather than in it.
3. **Global Expansion Made Easy**: Sparky facilitates international market connections by overcoming language barriers and tailoring marketing strategies, supporting business growth beyond borders and enabling multiple income streams, allowing you to more efficiently promote whatever businesses you are already involved in.

I haven’t fully left but more so just have taken a step back from them and have excused myself from the group chats. I love my friends but I feel that they were constantly wrapped up in drama, drama that was so chaotic with each other that you couldn’t really tell who was to blame. Unresolved arguments. Screaming matches. Misunderstandings. I’ll admit, I never started any fights but there are times where i unintentionally fueled some fires trying to put them out. 

I started to deal with my own personal issues and voiced that I needed to take a step back from everything as to not add more chaos to people’s lives, and I would be slowly coming back. I told them this and they were mostly supportive. 

Here’s where I might be the jerk. I haven’t really returned. In fact, I’m slowly losing contact with them as I keep seeing and hearing that they continue getting into bad situations socially and financially. When I was still very much involved, I felt that every five minutes, the group chat was blowing up with someone needing something. Like a ride. Advice. Money. Possessions. It was constant. This was another reason I left. I was one of a few who had a car in the group  and was constantly being sent to grab someone or run errands to the point where I didn’t have much time in my day to take care of myself. When I voiced that I couldn’t do this anymore, sometimes I was met love, sometimes I was met with, “Well I’m glad you can afford a car, but I can’t.”I tried to be empathetic to my friends financial situations, but Im struggling too. During my hiatus, I made new friends, and I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. One of the people from my old friend group reached out to me to meet up for coffee and I agreed. She voiced that she’s been hurt that I don’t hang out as much. I validated her feelings, told her that I missed her as well, but I told her that I had a lot of concerns about our friend group and before deciding on how involved I want to be, I took a break to handle some of my own personal issues. She told me that I should’ve asked our group for help. I didn’t really know what to say to this. In truth, I don’t want them helping me. With anything. With how much chaos that they have caused with each other, I didn’t really think that they would have time, or truly the mental or emotional capability to handle my problems. 
Our coffee date ended on a good note, but now they are posting things like, “If your friends reach out to you for support, and you’re too “busy”, you’re a bad friend.” I have this gut feeling like it’s a jab at me. And if I do talk to anyone in the friend group, it’s awkward. Sometimes it’s met with, “Oh because things get a little rocky every now and then, you just get up and leave? And now you have a new group of people?” I feel like I’ve betrayed them, but I also just can’t bring myself to come back fully. Am I a jerk?

Edit: Yes I have taken accountability for my actions when it came to my part in the chaos and have apologized to those I’ve hurt. ",1,1736218034.0,AITA_Relationships,4,1.0,False

This innovative gadget is designed for those of us who find joy in observing wildlife and want to deepen our understanding of the ecosystem around us. Imagine being able to sit in your backyard, sipping your morning coffee, while your camera does the heavy lifting—capturing and identifying various species flitting about.

What really catches my attention is the potential for education and awareness. In a world where we’re increasingly detached from nature, tools like this can help rekindle our curiosity and appreciation for the biodiversity that surrounds us. It’s like having a nature guide right at your fingertips! Plus, the ability to learn about these creatures in real-time could inspire a new generation of environmental enthusiasts.

However, I can’t help but wonder if this is more than just a cool gadget. Are we over-relying on technology to connect with the natural world? While I see the appeal of having such advanced identification capabilities, there’s something to be said for the joy of simply observing nature without the lens of technology. 

In the end, I’m excited about what Bird Buddy is offering, but I’m also cautious. It’ll be interesting to see if this camera truly enhances our outdoor experiences or if it ends up being just another tech novelty. What do you all think?

I started drinking coffee in my teens. Over the past decade as a working adult, it has been a daily habit for me to have one coffee in the morning, and one coffee after lunch which I would sip slowly over the afternoon in my office cubicle. In a way, my coffee drinks are my emotional/mental crutch which I rely on to feel that I would be okay and have enough energy for the day.

After coming across this subreddit, I happened to take a few days off work, and stopped my afternoon coffee because I had time for naps, and didn't need the boost to get me through the afternoon. I decided to ride on this by continuing to cut my afternoon coffee.

It's been a week so far, and I am not sure if it's my imagination but I feel less tense in my head/neck area, and a bit more relaxed. I fall asleep much more easily too. Usually I sleep all the way until my alarm clock wakes me up, but I now wake up naturally at about 5-6am (although I continue to laze in bed). 

At work, I have now switched my drink to a non-caffeinated tea which I slowly sip as my emotional crutch drink. 

I am going to slowly taper down the amount of coffee I have in the morning and eventually to zero.

Was my decision afterwards the right one? ","We knew each other since 2018, but got in contact during November 2023 after she had just ended a relationship with her ex boyfriend. (The guy left her out of nowhere after going to college, and had intimate relations with her which led to unfortunate events for her at the time) We then kind of did or had this online flirting with each other in the following months. She said she needed time to forget about him and so we waited (She wanted to graduate, leave the past behind and be “all mine”) until around June of 2024 during her high school graduation we became official. We had our own intimacy through pictures, our own movie/tv show nights on calls. I even made a Snapchat account since she asked me to make one. Around September 2024 after she went with her family on a trip (She and her mom would get tattoos) She began acting weird, she no longer wanted “Intimacy”, she didn’t seemed as interested in texting me as before. (Usually we would chat on discord/snapchat and she would always send me pictures of her trips, where she was at and what she was doing, she also spoke to her friends about me and heard their voices on a call while she was video gaming with them.) Regardless, she still wanted us to cosplay some characters from an animated movie she liked, wished me happy international boyfriend day and one week before finally ignoring me told me to watch Wicked on a pirated site with her. The last conversation before we watched wicked was that with her cosmetology classes she wouldn’t have time at all. She also said she “hated” how upset I was whenever she wasn’t around and didn’t wanted to hurt me anymore. I told her I would be totally fine waiting all the time I needed to wait, that I wanted her to chase the dreams she had and I would always be there to support it but also told her to at least text me one day per week, to let me know she was okay. (I also would like to remark after getting desperate as she would go on half a week without even telling me she was busy, once texting back there was this time in which she would say out of nowhere that “She felt I was hiding stuff from her sometimes” when I urged her and asked what exactly where those
things she thought I was supposedly hiding from her she didn’t gave me a precise answer. They were out of the blue too.) What true boyfriend/girlfriend wouldn’t want their partner to be alright, right? At first I thought it was due to her parents being strict but after I told my mom she said she was most likely either back with her ex and in contact with him, or had found a replacement for me since September 2024 which was when everything started. I didn’t try to get her back so far, as my mom told me her blocking me everywhere (Instagram, Snapchat, discord) was a way of saying she didn’t wanted me in her life anymore, but that it wasn’t my fault at all, that it was okay to cry but that she didn’t wanted me to cry for someone that couldn’t care less about me. She’s a great mother but I just can’t, I should listen to my mom but all the daily Snapchats messages where she called me baby, telling me her daily activities like going to her close by cafe, a place called “Farmer’s market” where she got her coffee and hanged out with her friend group from high school, I miss it all. Did she cheated on me? the only way I could get an answer would be asking her but I never did, I was afraid to come off as insecure and never had any negative feelings towards my relationship nor her to think such a thing. Could it be that maybe it was because she knew my previous partner also broke me emotionally (I told her about it and they both kind of knew each other in the past, same online group.) and she was too coward to admit she also disappointed me so preferred to block me? I don’t know and right now I’m doing my best to move on, I don’t hold any grudges nor I hate her at all. For now at least a part of me will always love her, but this month hasn’t been great at all, neither was Christmas nor new years as I wanted us to call during those days like we used to. I’m not telling my story here to whine about it, be an attention seeker or
feel pity. I was interested in hearing any of you guys’ experiences that were similar to mine and maybe have what they call an interesting midnight conversation. I’m working hard every day to move on from it, but we can’t deny a part of us will be in the meantime, devastated because of it. ",1,1736217446.0,Breakupadvice,0,0.99,False

1hvh4c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hvh4c0/the_worstcase_scenario_came_true/,The worst-case scenario came true,"Oh man. I'll preface this by saying the last few weeks has been a tornado. My ex (27M) and I (20F) broke up in mid-October after dating for over 1.5 years and sharing a (mostly) beautiful, caring relationship. It was somewhat of a mutual breakup as things just weren't really working out. Towards the end he had told me that he would to anything to keep a future with me, but things still ended up not really working. I tried to get back together about 2 weeks post-breakup. He denied my attempt, saying we both needed time to process. 

An important thing to note in this situation is the fact that we live together. We're both in college, so we live in a house together in the college town. Luckily, we do NOT share a room. Due to living together we had continued hooking up post break up on a few occassions. Each time after we hooked up he got completely cold-shouldered towards me. However, we were still interacting semi-friendly, he helped my fix my car, so on and so forth. 

Fast forward a bit to mid-December. We had a huge fight after we both returned from a night out downtown, but it ended with up sleeping together and hanging out all day the next day (going to study at a coffee shop, going out to dinner, spending the night together again). The next morning (after spending two nights together) I had to leave on a trip to Mexico with one of my friends. We agreed that it would be important to revisit and have a conversation upon my return. While in Mexico he checked up on me periodically, although kind of backed off towards the end of the trip. When I returned he had completely flipped his demeanor again, back to being somewhat cold. 

Over the holidays I tried to visit my mom, which didn't go very well. So, I ended up spending the holidays with his family and was with him for four days (which was clearly what he wanted at the time and that was verbalized). The entire time I was with him it was extremely relationship-y. I'm talking slow dancing in the kitchen, sleeping in the same bed, random waist grab to kiss on the street kind of stuff. During this time period he told me he loved me. He also randomly brought up one of our other housemates that he had recently gotten close to, saying ""I'm so happy to have a friend like \_\_\_\_. We talked and set boundaries that there is nothing going on there and it feels good to have a female friend like that. I'm not attracted to her at all"", so on and so forth. I half-joked back ""Good, because it would really really hurt me if anything happened between the two of you"".

I ended up going back home earlier than him. When I got back, said housemate was there and she began prying at me about my feelings on the situation and if I think we're going to get back together. I told her how I felt, that I wanted to get back together but wasn't sure honestly about the situation at hand. 

Later that night she mentioned that he was planning to go to Joshua Tree with her for NYE. The next morning they were meant to leave. That morning I felt overwhelmingly sad. As they were about to leave, I left to the backyard to cry because I just couldn't be around them. I presume he heard me crying, because he came running back there to console me. I told him ""I think you don't care about how I feel at all"" to which he replied ""That's not true"".  He then made it clear that he was on a time crunch and had to leave.

He texted me saying he felt bad about that interaction and wished he could say more but couldn't. The next day, he texted me checking up on me and my New Years plans. I didn't respond because I felt it was unnecessary and I was already hurt. I was out having fun with my friends, anyway, and trying not to focus on a guy who was giving me LITERALLY nothing.

When I got back home, both she and him gave me hugs and asked about my trip. They were enthusiastic to share and almost over welcoming. That's when I noticed a hickey on her neck. It was strange, because while I was gone I had envisioned coming home and seeing a hickey on her neck. Now, it was true. An awful feeling began looming over me. I asked her about it, and she responded extremely suspiciously ""Oh, yeah, uh... It was this random guy. Haha, New Years fun, am I right?"". I immediately knew what had happened....

Later in the day, I came up to her and asked her to be just be honest with me. She was very adamant about dodging my inquiry: ""I know you might be uncomfortable with us being close friends but..."" to which I told her that wasn't what I was talking about. She just shot me a look that said 'I'm not giving you anything', so I walked away. A few moments later she came to find me in the backyard and told me she had something to tell me.

Of course I was right, they had slept together. Obviously I know that he is now single and has to autonomy to do whatever he wants, but its really just the premise of everything. He was essentially leading me on FOR MONTHS, alluding to the idea that he wants to get back together but feels like he 'needs to change'. She was pretending to care about my feelings and be my friend the entire time as well. On top of it all of the lies just kill me. If you're going to do something like that, just be honest about it. It's been a whirlwind of emotion and I'm trying to figure out how to exist in this house at the moment. She will be moving out at the beginning of February, it will be harder to get him out unfortunately. I'm currently not speaking with him at all and honestly don't plan to.

I was extremely angry the first few days after finding out (and still am), but now the sadness is coming back in slowly. I feel like I'm mourning the person that I thought he was. I just need to find a way to move forward and forget this whole mess ever affected me in the first place.",1,1736217060.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False
1hvh2ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1hvh2ac/should_i_dm_the_ex/,Should i DM the ex ?,"Hi! This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. I need solid advice. My fiance and i have been together for about 4.5 years. We're in the midst of planning a wedding for this summer but in the process we've gotten into some pretty heated arguments. This is going to be long, so, sorry in advance.

  
When my fiance and i first started dating he was on social media, across the board. I noticed immediately he had photos up of what i could only come to the conclusion of being his ex. ( I deleted my FB in 2015 ) so i didn't have any access to FB to see his profile. I moved back into the city we live in now, i was coming from being out of an abusive relationship and moving back home but a lot of people that i use to know either moved out or moved out for covid. ( We live in a big city ) so i didn't have a lot of time or ways to connect with people, plus i WFH full time. After a few months of dating we decided to move in together. This was during covid, his roommate was moving out and i was alone in a city i consider home but often lonely in my own apartment. I was so excited. Until i wasn't. The more i learned about the ex the more i questioned. They dated for 6 years, he told me she use to scream at him for simply 'asking if she's almost ready to go'. When i moved in i noticed he still had those photos up on IG of her. None of me or of us. His facebook was public so my friend was able to see it and sent me a video of it where i could see he had albums on there of her and him. Let me add at this point ( it was 2020 ) and they broke up in 2017 so roughly 3 years?  In the basement there was a box of her things that he moved to the city with even though they had been broken up previously for about a year or so before he moved. There were instax photos of her in his draws that i found one day. Granted they were in a bottom of a drawer but flipped over side by side. He claimed he doesn't even remember those being there and probably forgot to throw them away. The box of stuff in the basement, she simply was suppose to pick up but never did and the movers ended up grabbing the box and thats how it ended up here. OH and the instagram photos he completely forgot to take those down and never looked at his own profile. Now he doesn't use instagram, so thats why theres no photos of me or us. 

  
He has a girl thats a friend who use to work with him in a different location and now works with him currently so they've been friends for years, during the time he was with the ex. I guess sometime over the weekend she was sending him photos of previous coworkers and funny post. She sent him a facebook post he commented on years ago. Initially when i saw the thread this wasn't in there. I decided to snoop and saw there was a deleted message so i recovered it thinking why would he delete this? I go back to the thread and i see this post, but im still questioning why would he delete this? I zoom in, and then i see it. It was a profile photo of him and his ex. Something he's never done for me in 4.5 years. I initially asked why he deleted this and he claimed he didn't delete any messages, but i told him i could see it after i recovered it. He then said because he didn't want to deal with me being upset. 

now i am upset. Im not upset because of this photo though its becoming more obvious to me im a stepping stone but earlier today we got into an argument because about a month or so ago he lied to me about going to get a cup of coffee when we share locations and for some reason i just happened to look at that time and day and saw him going to get coffee so i tried to call and text him to ask if he could get me one as well but when he called me back he told me he didn't go get coffee and that he was working and im insane. He acted irrational all day that day, he blocked me, he wouldn't talk to me he told me he wanted to break up with me. This went on for 2 days, finally on the second day when i wasn't letting up that i was being gaslit he finally said he lied and he did go get coffee but didn't want to deal with me... i guess asking for one too?

This got me thinking if he could act like this so casually over a cup of coffee then what else has he lied to me about this whole time. About a year ago his ex who i mentioned earlier ( the one that had been broken up with him at this point for 7 years ) somehow messaged him on IG. He told me she was blocked and showed me, she was. She messaged a group chat that they had with a friend from 10 years prior and sent over a video of something stupid on the explore page. No i dont think this was an accident. Especially after he told her he does not want to talk to her ( prior to me and him meeting ) and blocked her ( i watched him block her on IG ). Since then i can't shake the feeling that something with that is weird. 

Every time i try to ask about why they broke up he tells me they moved into an apartment together the last year they were together and lived in it for about 3 months and after work one day she just came home and decided to break up with him. I asked if there was a previous fight or something maybe a week, month or few days prior and he always says no. Obviously this makes no sense. Im also starting to believe he lies through his teeth. I want to know why they broke up because i am missing a BIG part of this puzzle and why am i being lied to about it.

today during our argument we had both decided to have lunch and right when i sat down with my food he decided to spit in it and then tell me to go fuck myself and headed back to work. This not only left me feeling disgusted but just overall in awe of the person i thought i knew. He's told me before im probably making up about being in an abusive relationship but then later on apologized and said he was angry when saying that. He's called me a cunt, same apologized. 

I just feel like in this relationship im always getting the short end of the stick. I feel like my partners in competition with me. After he left we exchanged messages a few hours later where he said he was sorry and felt bad but i egged him on...by voicing my concerns???? oh sorry my concern was that he lied to me about who he got coffee with today and instead of being rational and realizing why i feel that way his response was to spit in my food. 

  
I want to know if this is a pattern of behavior and if this is going to get worse. I know i listed 101 reasons why i need to leave but in every day life he doesn't act like this where as my ex did so im not sure if thats why im tolerating this or what. I think i just want answers i want to be sure either way before making either decision.

After countless applications, not one callback. 

I understand that company would hire a local over an international students since it cheaper and an easier process. Meanwhile I have to get a visa etc.

What do you think I should do?

But I have hard time targeting a specific internship role and finding someone to actually help me out. I been connecting with people on LinkedIn. That I want to talk to. But I’m still on requested.

I don’t know what church he joined but he always knows what day is Sunday. And he has, without fail, for the last three years. 

Backstory - we (and the second, less schedule shiba Lana) moved back home with family over three years ago.  Pretty quickly we got in a morning routine when we get home from our walk (every morning rain or shine) the Shibas getting a treat from my dad. I pour my coffee, get my breakfast, they get their treat. 

Except for Sundays. Archer does not take a treat on Sundays. They are offered, they are ready, he is nowhere to be found (okay he can be found - usually chilling in the basement near his food bowl). I do not understand why or how it is just Sundays. 

I work a pretty consistent work schedule - but I had more than 2 weeks off for Christmas (this is normal, same thing last two years), he still knows Sunday. Family is away and I give the treats? He still knows Sunday. We do hot family breakfast on Sundays - we do an extra on a different day due to holidays - he still knows Sunday. Skip it? He still skips his Sunday treat. 

Any schedule variation I can figure out that identifies a Sunday - is meaningless and does not change his treat schedule. 6 during the week, abstain on Sundays. 


How. How does he know. And why?! We joke he has become religious in his old age (turns 12 in a few weeks) but I really don’t know.

So before I start this, I'm well aware that I can get great quality shots out of the flair - and I have been! I love the thing. I use a bottomless basket on it and I have a good distribution tool and tamper.

I get a good central flow with minimal or no channeling pretty consistently.

I make coffee for my wife every morning. She loves it, I love it, it's a great part of our routine. There's minimal steaming involved since I usually make her iced drinks with oat milk and syrup or something. Then I make myself a pour over or aeropress since I like black coffee. However, I am starting to get annoyed that I can really only make a single shot of espresso before needing to tear down, clean, and re-set up. Sometimes I want more, or she does! Sometimes I do like a straight espresso or americano. 

I currently use a kindgrinder k6 for espresso and an encore for pour over or AP.

I have been looking at the gaggia classic e24 very enviously. That thing looks sweet. And I already have an espresso capable grinder so I won't need to blow $300 more. Maybe just a bottomless portafilter and a tamper.

Is it worth it to get that? If I do get it, could I be easily pulling 2-3 double shots a morning if I'm not using steam? Or would I be better off getting another bottomless basket for the flair and just getting over the extra steps? 

I haven't made an update to my coffee stuff in a few years so my budget is around $600 USD. Could be flexible if there is some amazing machine I haven't heard of yet, but I definitely don't need a dual boiler or anything crazy. I'm not too picky really, just looking for the ability to make a few shots back to back easier than the flair, and if it's worth it.
