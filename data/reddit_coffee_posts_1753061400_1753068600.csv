1m58b5b,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m58b5b,Burn Rate 101: How Much Runway Does Your Startup Really Have?,"# Burn Rate 101: How Much Runway Does Your Startup Really Have?

As a small business owner, you wear a dozen hats a day. You’re the CEO, the head of sales, the lead marketer, and sometimes, even the janitor. With so much to juggle, it’s easy to focus on the exciting metrics: new customers, website traffic, social media engagement. But there’s a quieter, more critical number lurking in your financial statements that can mean the difference between scaling your dream and shutting your doors for good.

It’s called your **burn rate**. And this is the simple calculation that tells you exactly how long your business can survive.

Imagine two startups. Startup A is getting tons of press, has a beautiful office, and a rapidly growing team. They’re the talk of the town. Startup B is much quieter. They’re heads-down, focused on a small but loyal customer base, and their team is lean. On the surface, Startup A looks like the clear winner. But six months later, Startup A has laid off half its staff and is desperately seeking a buyout, while Startup B has just become profitable.

What happened? Startup A had a dangerously high burn rate. They were spending money faster than they were making it, and their cash reserves evaporated.

This isn't just a cautionary tale for venture-backed tech companies. Understanding and managing your **startup burn rate** is a fundamental survival skill for every small business owner, whether you're running a coffee shop, a digital agency, or a subscription box service. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to become the master of your cash flow and ensure your business has the fuel it needs to succeed.

# What is Burn Rate? Gross vs. Net Burn

At its core, burn rate is the speed at which your company is spending its cash reserves. It’s typically measured on a monthly basis. However, to get a truly accurate picture, we need to distinguish between two types: Gross Burn and Net Burn.

# Gross Burn Rate

Your Gross Burn Rate is the total amount of cash your company spends in a month on operating expenses. Think of it as the total cash flowing out of your business. This includes everything you spend to keep the lights on, such as:

* **Salaries and payroll taxes**
* **Rent or mortgage for your office or storefront**
* **Software subscriptions (e.g., CRM, accounting software, project management tools)**
* **Marketing and advertising costs**
* **Utilities**
* **Inventory and cost of goods sold (COGS)**
* **Professional services (legal, accounting)**

**Example:** Let's say in a typical month, your business spends:

* $15,000 on salaries
* $5,000 on rent
* $2,000 on marketing
* $3,000 on software and other expenses

Your **Gross Burn Rate** would be $25,000 for that month.

# Net Burn Rate

Gross Burn is useful, but it only tells half the story. It ignores the cash coming *into* your business. Your **Net Burn Rate** is the real measure of your company’s financial health. It’s the difference between your total cash outflows (expenses) and your total cash inflows (revenue).

The formula is simple:

>

This number shows you how much cash your company is truly losing each month.

**Example:** Let's use our previous example. We know the company's Gross Burn (total expenses) is $25,000. Now, let's say in that same month, they generated $15,000 in revenue from sales.

* Net Burn Rate = $25,000 (Expenses) - $15,000 (Revenue) = **$10,000**

This means the company’s cash position decreased by $10,000 that month. This is the number that truly matters. If your revenue was $30,000, your Net Burn would be -$5,000, which means you’re cash-flow positive and *increasing* your cash reserves by $5,000 a month! For the rest of this article, when we say ""burn rate,"" we'll be referring to the Net Burn Rate.

# The All-Important Runway Calculation: How Long Can You Survive?

Now that you know your Net Burn Rate, you can calculate the single most important metric for any pre-profitable business: your runway.

Your **runway** is the amount of time, in months, your company can continue to operate before it runs out of money, assuming your revenue and expenses remain constant.

# The Runway Calculation Formula

The **runway calculation** is just as straightforward as the burn rate formula:

>

# A Step-by-Step Guide to Calculating Your Runway

1. **Find Your Total Cash on Hand:** This is the easiest step. Look at all your business bank accounts and add up the total cash you have available right now. Let's say you have **$100,000**.
2. **Calculate Your Average Monthly Net Burn:** Don't just use last month's numbers. Business can be lumpy. To get a more accurate picture, calculate your average Net Burn Rate over the last three months.
   * Month 1 Net Burn: $12,000
   * Month 2 Net Burn: $8,000
   * Month 3 Net Burn: $10,000
   * Total Net Burn over 3 months = $30,000
   * Average Monthly Net Burn = $30,000 / 3 = **$10,000**
3. **Divide Cash by Burn:** Now, just plug the numbers into the formula.
   * Runway = $100,000 / $10,000 = **10 months**

You have 10 months of runway. This is your financial deadline. It tells you that you have 10 months to either become profitable or secure additional funding before your cash runs out. This is a powerful, motivating number that should guide your strategic decisions.

**Best Practice:** This is not a one-and-done calculation. You should recalculate your burn rate and runway at the end of every single month. It’s your financial pulse, and you need to check it regularly.

# Beyond the Basics: The Power of a Cash Flow Forecast

Your burn rate and runway are like looking in the rearview mirror—they tell you what just happened. A **cash flow forecast**, on the other hand, is like your GPS. It helps you see the road ahead and navigate potential financial roadblocks before you hit them.

A cash flow forecast is a living document, usually a spreadsheet, that projects the cash moving in and out of your business over a future period, typically the next 6 to 12 months.

# Why a Cash Flow Forecast is Crucial

* **Anticipates Cash Crunches:** It can show you that while you have cash *now*, you might have a shortfall in six months when a big annual insurance premium is due and sales are seasonally slow.
* **Informs Strategic Decisions:** Can you afford to hire that new salesperson? Should you invest in that big piece of equipment? Your cash flow forecast provides the data to answer these questions with confidence.
* **Builds Credibility:** If you’re seeking a loan or **startup funding**, a well-reasoned cash flow forecast shows that you are a sophisticated founder who understands the financial dynamics of your business.

# How to Create a Simple Cash Flow Forecast

You don't need complex software. A simple spreadsheet will do.

1. **Rows:** List all your categories of cash inflows (sales, loans, etc.) and cash outflows (all your expense categories).
2. **Columns:** Use the next 12 months as your columns.
3. **Fill it Out:**
   * Start with your opening cash balance for the first month.
   * Go month by month and project your cash inflows and outflows. Be conservative with your revenue estimates and realistic (or even slightly pessimistic) with your expense estimates.
   * For each month, calculate: **Opening Balance + Total Inflows - Total Outflows = Closing Balance.**
   * The closing balance of one month becomes the opening balance for the next.

This exercise will give you an unparalleled understanding of the financial rhythm of your business and transform how you make decisions.

# How to Reduce Your Burn Rate and Extend Your Runway

If your runway calculation gave you a scare, don't panic. You have more control than you think. The goal is to reduce your burn rate, which will extend your runway. This isn't about thoughtless cost-slashing; it's about making strategic choices.

# The Best Defense is a Good Offense: Increase Revenue

The most sustainable way to lower your net burn is to increase the cash coming in.

* **Focus on Retention:** It's cheaper to keep a customer than to acquire a new one. What can you do to improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn?
* **Re-evaluate Pricing:** Are you undercharging for your product or service? A small price increase can have a huge impact on your cash flow.
* **Upsell and Cross-sell:** What complementary products or premium services can you offer your existing customers?

# Control the ""Big Three"" Expenses

For most businesses, the three largest expense categories are payroll, marketing, and office space.

* **Payroll:** Before making another full-time hire, ask yourself if the role can be filled by a freelancer, contractor, or part-time employee. Consider performance-based bonuses as a way to reward success without increasing fixed costs.
* **Marketing:** Scrutinize your marketing spend. Double down on the channels that provide a clear, measurable return on investment (ROI) and cut the ones that don't.
* **Office Space:** In the age of remote and hybrid work, a large, expensive office is often an unnecessary luxury. Could your team work from home or a more affordable co-working space?

# Optimize Every Other Cost

* **Conduct a ""Subscription Audit"":** Go through your bank statements and cancel any software or services you're not using. You’ll be surprised at what you find.
* **Negotiate with Vendors:** Don't be afraid to ask your suppliers for better terms or a discount. The worst they can say is no.
* **Foster a Lean Culture:** Encourage your team to be mindful of expenses. When everyone treats the company's money like their own, small savings add up quickly.

# Burn Rate and Startup Funding: Speaking the Investor's Language

If you plan to raise **startup funding**, your burn rate and runway will be under intense scrutiny. Investors are essentially buying you time. They want to know how you're using their capital and how long it will last.

# What Investors Look For

* **Capital Efficiency:** Are you using your cash wisely to achieve meaningful milestones (e.g., building a product, acquiring customers)? A high burn rate with little to show for it is a major red flag.
* **A Reasonable Runway:** Typically, investors want to see that their investment will provide you with at least **12-18 months of runway**. This gives you enough time to make significant progress before you need to start fundraising again, which is a major distraction.
* **Financial Acumen:** A founder who can speak intelligently about their burn rate, runway, and cash flow forecast is immediately more credible than one who can't.

# The Fundraising ""Danger Zone""

**Best Practice:** Start your fundraising process when you still have at least 6-9 months of runway. Fundraising always takes longer than you think. If you wait until you only have 2-3 months of cash left, investors will know you're desperate, and you'll lose all your negotiating leverage.

# Conclusion: Your Burn Rate is a Strategic Tool, Not a Doomsday Clock

Your burn rate isn't a grade on your performance. It's a tool. It's a diagnostic metric that gives you clarity, focus, and control.

By understanding what it is, calculating it regularly, and using it to inform your decisions, you move from being a passenger in your business to being the pilot. You can see turbulence ahead, adjust your course, and manage your fuel with precision.

Mastering your burn rate empowers you to build a more resilient, sustainable, and ultimately, more successful business. Now, go open that spreadsheet and find your number. Your future self will thank you.

Their hearts belonged to the same woman: Janet Jameson, the butler's daughter.  
 Even their dying words were the same: Don't marry me.  
 So in this life, I would not waste my time on anyone who does not truly want me.  
 ""If I must marry for the sake of the family, I choose Samuel Lockwood,"" I told my parents.  
 ""Samuel? Do you mean the illegitimate son from the northern branch of the Lockwood family? Why him all of a sudden?"" they asked, stunned.  
 Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and dominated the business world like no one else.  
 If this marriage was about alliances and power, then I would make it count.  
 Samuel was the kind of man who offered nothing but upside.  
 As for love? I had stopped hoping for that.  
 \*\*\*  
 Emma Dalton was reborn on the day her parents laid out profiles of the eldest sons from the three top families in Chicago, asking her to choose one to marry.  
 Without hesitation, she shook her head. ""I'm not picking any of them.""  
 Her parents, Brent and Cassandra, were shocked. ""Why not?""  
 ""Because...""  
 Her heart throbbed painfully. She had been married to all three of them in her last life.  
 In the upper circles, everyone knew the Thompson, Vegara, Vanderpool, and Dalton families were the four powerhouses of Chicago.  
 Emma, the only daughter among the four, had become the most sought-after bride—each of the other three families wanted to marry into the Dalton family.  
 In her previous life, when she was choosing her marriage partner for the first time, she chose Isaac Thompson, and she happily thought that she would be happy for the rest of her life.  
 However, after they got married, he was not at home for 364 out of 365 days a year, not only making her a laughing stock in the circle but also dying in a chain car accident while trying to protect Janet.  
 Emma had been widowed at a young age, losing her first husband and spending three years alone before being remarried to Anthony Vegara—another match arranged by her family.  
 However, Anthony never cared about the marriage. To him, Emma meant nothing. In their second year together, he died in a reckless racing accident—all for Janet.  
 Because of this, people started calling Emma a husband-killer. It was not until she turned 30 that she married Mateo Vanderpool.  
 This time, their marriage was quiet and respectful. They lived peacefully, growing old together—until Mateo fell ill. Before he died, he held her hand and whispered his final wish.  
 ""Emma, if there's another life, please don't marry me. I just want to be with Janet.""  
 It was then Emma realized that all of them had loved Janet.  
 That was why, before they each died, their last words were always the same, ""Don't choose me for marriage.""  
 Janet was just the daughter of the Dalton family's butler. She was neither beautiful nor talented. All she knew how to do was act fragile and sweet.  
 Emma never understood how she lost to someone like that. She never knew why the men loved Janet so much that they were even willing to marry Emma just to protect Janet from being used by the family.  
 Emma spent her whole life watching them love Janet, and her whole life learning one simple truth.  
 She, Emma Dalton, was never anyone's supporting role.  
 She did not want someone who did not want her.  
 So in this life, she did not pick any of the same men. Instead, she gave her parents a new answer.  
 ""If I'm getting married, I only want Samuel from the Lockwood family.""  
 Brent and Cassandra were stunned.  
 ""Samuel? The illegitimate son of the Lockwoods in New York? Why would you want to marry him all of a sudden?""  
 Because in his previous life, Samuel Lockwood rose to become the richest man in the world. He topped the Forbes list and held massive sway in the business world.  
 If this marriage was for the family's benefit, then Emma needed to get the most out of it.  
 Samuel was a man who came with nothing but advantages.  
 As for love? She had stopped hoping for that.  
 Even though Brent and Cassandra were strongly opposed at first, Emma racked her brain to come up with reason after reason.  
 ""New York's economy is booming, and the Lockwood Group is the most influential family there. Haven't you always wanted to break into the New York market but had to back off because we didn't have a foothold? Marrying Samuel is our chance. You've even said it yourselves—Samuel is ambitious, sharp, and ruthless. A man like that is bound to achieve great things.""  
 Emma's analysis was solid, and they could not find any flaw in her logic.  
 After weighing the pros and cons, they finally decided to support her choice. They took the initiative to contact the Lockwood family and finalize the engagement.  
 ""Emma, both families have come to an agreement. The wedding will be held in half a month.""  
 When she heard that, Emma finally felt a bit of relief settle in her chest.  
 Time was tight, so Brent and Cassandra hurried to prepare the dowry.  
 Emma sat alone on the couch, her mind a swirl of thoughts and emotions all tangled up.  
 Just then, footsteps sounded at the door.  
 Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo stepped inside, their eyes immediately landing on her.  
 ""Emma, who did you choose to marry?""  
 They asked in unison, their faces full of tension and seriousness. For a moment, Emma was dazed.  
 The four of them had grown up together. They were childhood friends who were practically inseparable.  
 Those three had always treated her like a princess and spoiled her endlessly.  
 Whatever she wanted, they gave it to her. Whenever she was upset, they comforted her, and whenever she was bullied, they stood up for her first.  
 Back then, she truly believed that it was because they cared deeply.  
 In her previous life, when they rushed in with those same questions, she had thought it was because they were excited to be chosen.  
 Now, she saw it clearly. They were not hoping to be picked, and that was what those expressions meant.  
 That realization made her heartache. Her chest felt tight as if she could not breathe.  
 After a long silence, she finally composed herself, then replied in a low, raspy voice.  
 ""In 15 days, you'll know who I chose.""  
 Emma did not budge, still keeping her answer to herself. The three of them were starting to get impatient, clearly eager to press her for more.  
 However, before she could say anything else, her phone rang.  
 ""Emma, Janet was badly hurt in an accident and she's in the hospital right now. But there aren't any available wards. Can you help us?"" The tearful voice of the butler, Horace Jameson, trembled through the speaker.  
 Before Emma could even react, Isaac grabbed the phone from her, his tone tight with concern.  
 ""Which hospital?""  
 There was a pause on the other end. Then, choking on emotion, Horace named the hospital.  
 Isaac hung up immediately, turned to Emma, and said, ""Don't worry about it, Emma. I'll handle the hospital situation. It's nothing.""  
 Without missing a beat, Anthony and Mateo also jumped in.  
 ""The hospital's owned by the Vegara family. I'll talk to the director myself. Just stay home and rest, Emma.""  
 ""I know some top-tier specialists. I'll reach out to them, so you don't need to worry.""  
 They all claimed they were doing it for her, but Emma knew the truth—they were all just looking for excuses to rush to Janet's side.  
 How had she missed it before? Their feelings had been right in front of her the whole time.  
 As she watched their backs disappear out the door, Emma gave a faint, bitter smile.  
 Then she turned away, walked back to her room, and quietly began packing everything related to them.  
 By the time she finished, night had fallen. She picked up her phone and saw Janet's newest post on her feed.  
 ""Another day of being doted on by the three powerful men.""  
 Attached was a selfie from the VIP ward.  
 She was sipping Mateo's signature soup while Isaac's watch sat neatly on the bedside table. Meanwhile, Anthony's jacket was draped over the chair beside her.  
 Emma tapped ""Like"" on the post, then looked at the three boxes she had just packed.  
 Each box held the gift she had received at 18—one from Isaac's father, one from Anthony's mother, and one from Mateo's grandfather. All three were heirlooms from the three families.  
 Whichever one she chose to keep would symbolize her family's decision on which family to form a marriage alliance with.  
 Now, her marriage had already been decided and it was time to give her an answer.  
 Emma called a courier to her home and handed the three boxes to him.  
 ""Please mail these out separately—15 days from today.""  
   
  
\# Chapter 2  
 After mailing out the packages, Emma tossed everything she had just organized straight into the trash.  
 The jewelry and designer bags gifted by Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo, the old videos and photos from their time together, even the custom suits she had designed for them with care...  
 All of it—every memory tied to them—was now part of the past, discarded without hesitation.  
 In this life, Emma was not going to repeat her old mistakes.  
 She poured all her focus into preparing for the wedding, tuning out the world outside her own little bubble.  
 After a few hectic days of picking out her dress and accessories, she finally came home—only to find Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo all fussing over Janet.  
 One was adjusting the AC temperature, another gently fanning a bowl of soup to cool it down, and the third was draping a blanket over her, asking how she was feeling with sincere concern.  
 Watching Janet being doted on like royalty, Emma could not help but smile bitterly to herself.  
 The affection was so obvious now, how had she missed it before?  
 The ache in her chest tightened, leaving her feeling drained and a little hollow.  
 Right then, Janet noticed her standing at the door. Startled like a timid bird, Janet quickly got to her feet, her expression filled with fear and deference.  
 ""Emma, you're back! I'll go heat up some water and get dinner started. Please give me a moment.""  
 She started to rise, but Isaac gently held her down.  
 ""Janet's still recovering. There are plenty of other staff around. Emma, just ask someone else to handle it.""  
 Anthony and Mateo chimed in as well. ""She's still pretty injured. Emma, just let her rest.""  
 ""If you're really short on help, we can always transfer more staff. There's no need for Janet to be doing chores in her condition.""  
 Since the moment she walked in, Emma had said nothing—yet she was being lectured like she'd done something wrong.  
 She let out a quiet breath and narrowed her eyes slightly. ""I know she's the daughter of our butler, not our maid. And I've never forced her to do anything. But since you all care about her so much, maybe you should just take her home and look after her yourselves. That way, you don't have to worry so much.""  
 Janet's eyes widened in shock and she immediately dropped to her knees.  
 ""Emma, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have slacked off just because I'm sick. Please don't drive me and my dad away. I'll get up right now and get to work.""  
 Her knee hit the ground hard and they bruised instantly. Her tears streamed down her face like rain, looking like she had been deeply wronged.  
 The moment her tears started falling, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo's expressions darkened.  
 The three of them rushed to help Janet up, shielding her behind them as they all turned to Emma, their voices tinged with frustration.  
 ""Janet didn't do anything wrong. Why are you trying to kick her out for no reason? Do you really have to bully her like this?""  
 ""She's still hurt and was trying to heat your water and make you dinner. Not only do you not care about her condition, but you're also forcing her to leave. Do you have no heart at all?""  
 ""She's hurt even worse now. If anything happens to her later because of this, are you just going to pretend it's nothing? Will you only be satisfied if she completely breaks down?""  
 Watching them so naturally jump to defend Janet, Emma's expression turned colder by the second.  
 ""I didn't do anything except suggest that you take her home if you're that worried. That's considered bullying now? In your eyes, am I really that unreasonable and difficult? So no matter what happens, she's the victim and I'm the one to blame?""  
 Her words brought silence crashing down on the room.  
 Seeing their frozen expressions, Emma felt a wave of helplessness wash over her.  
 She did not want to say anything more. Without another word, she turned and walked back to her bedroom.  
 Just as she had finally calmed down, there was a knock at the door.  
 Janet came in timidly, holding a cup of coffee. ""I'm sorry, Emma. Please don't be angry at them. They only spoke like that because they were too worried about me. It's my fault you ended up fighting. If you need someone to blame, blame me.""  
 Having lived through this once already, Emma knew exactly what Janet was trying to do. She would put on a pitiful act and stir the pot.  
 ""Leave the coffee and get out.""  
 Emma's voice was cold and detached. Hearing that, Janet looked even more wronged, but she did not dare push back.  
 Then, she pretended to fumble and spilled the entire cup of coffee.  
 The hot liquid splashed onto Emma, scalding her skin until it turned red and blistered.  
 Emma let out a hiss of pain and instinctively shoved Janet's helping hand away.  
 Janet took the chance to stumble backward dramatically, slamming her head against the edge of the table. A bloody gash instantly opened on her forehead.  
 Her sharp cries filled the entire villa.  
 Before Emma could even react, Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo burst through the door.  
 Seeing Janet unconscious on the floor with blood running down her head, the three of them instantly panicked.  
 Anthony shoved past Emma without hesitation. Isaac rushed forward and scooped Janet into his arms, while Mateo pressed down on the wound to stop the bleeding.  
 They hurried off, completely focused on protecting Janet. No one even noticed Emma had stumbled into the glass display case.  
 Shards flew everywhere as the glass shattered, slicing into her skin and leaving her covered in cuts.  
 Blood soaked through her clothes. Her face twisted in pain, and her whole body trembled uncontrollably.  
 Watching their figures disappear down the hall, Emma could not hold back her tears any longer.  
 Her heart ached so much it felt like she could not breathe. She bit down hard on her lip to keep from sobbing out loud.  
 Only one final thought echoed in her mind: She had to walk away from their world for good. Never again would she let herself be part of it.  
   
  
\# Chapter 3  
 After pushing through the pain and getting her wounds treated at the hospital, Emma took the prescription and headed to the pharmacy window—only to spot a few familiar figures outside the next ward.  
 Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo were standing outside Janet's room, their faces full of worry and heartache.  
 ""I've said it before, Janet's too soft. If she stays there, she's just going to keep suffering. Once the marriage is finalized, I'll find a way to get her out, no matter what. I don't want her to go through this anymore.""  
 ""Now that our parents know Janet's the one we really care about, we have to make sure she's protected. So no matter who Emma chooses, that guy has to accept the marriage and go along with it. That's the only way the family won't come after Janet.""  
 Emma stood there quietly, listening to every word, and suddenly felt her chest tighten.  
 So this was why they had gone along with the marriage in the previous life even when they clearly did not want to.  
 They thought they were protecting someone they loved even if it meant sacrificing their own happiness.  
 Yet, in doing so, they wrecked hers.  
 She looked down and laughed bitterly, tears blurring her vision.  
 They could relax this time as no one would have to sacrifice anything.  
 Once she collected herself, she wiped away her tears and turned to leave—only for her phone alarm to go off suddenly.  
 The sharp ringtone startled the three men. When they opened the door and saw her standing there, they all froze in surprise.  
 ""You're here? Are you planning to apologize to Janet?""  
 ""How much did you hear just now?""  
 ""What's with all those injuries? What happened to you?""  
 They all spoke at once, questions flying at her.  
 Emma answered calmly, one by one. ""I got hurt because you pushed me aside to get to Janet. I came here to get treatment, not to apologize. She spilled the hot coffee on me first, and I pushed her away. Running into you here was just a coincidence.""  
 Hearing her words, the three men fell silent, their expressions shifting into something more complicated.  
 After a moment, Anthony was the first to speak.  
 ""Janet didn't mean to spill the coffee. She's still recovering, so her hands are weak. Don't be mad at her. When we walked in and saw all that blood, we thought it was serious. That's why we lost it. I'm sorry.""  
 Isaac also took a breath and calmed down. ""We weren't trying to blame you earlier. We just felt bad for Janet, so we said a few things on her behalf.""  
 ""Yeah,"" Mateo added, ""we all grew up together. You've always been the one who mattered most to us. Have you thought about the marriage?""  
 As soon as he asked, the three of them stared at Emma, clearly nervous about her response.  
 Emma looked at them, her expression unreadable. After what she had just overheard, all she felt was a bitter irony.  
 ""Thought it through?"" She gave a cold smile. ""I... ""  
 Before she could finish, a sudden loud beeping came from the monitor in Janet's room.  
 Their faces changed instantly, and they all rushed back in to check. Medical staff poured into the ward right after them.  
 ""The patient's kidneys were already compromised after the second trauma,"" a doctor explained urgently. ""We didn't catch it in time and administered the wrong medication. It's led to acute kidney failure. Her condition is very serious now!""  
 Isaac's face went pale, his eyes red with panic.  
 ""How could you mess this up? She's still so young! If you ruin her life because of negligence, can you live with that?""  
 Anthony grabbed the doctor by the collar and barked furiously, ""You've got half an hour. I want a treatment plan that guarantees results. If anything happens to her, you'll answer for it.""  
 Mateo was already on the phone, frantically calling every contact he had.  
 ""Dr. Zimmerman, you're the best nephrologist in the country. Please, this is urgent. I need your help to save someone extremely important. Where are you now? I'll send my secretary to pick you up right away.""  
 The whole ward was in chaos. Everyone was on edge, trying everything they could for Janet.  
 Soon, the hospital pulled together a special team and quickly outlined the only viable solution.  
 ""She needs a kidney transplant as soon as possible,"" one specialist explained. ""But finding the right donor will take time. And the longer we wait, the higher the risk to her life.""  
   
  
\# Chapter 4  
 After hearing the diagnosis, the three men did not hesitate for a second and immediately went to get tested for a match.  
 The results came out quickly and Isaac was a compatible donor.  
 Without a word, he picked up the consent form the doctor handed over, signed it on the spot, and walked straight into the operating room.  
 Time ticked by slowly, and just as everyone was getting more and more anxious, a new problem cropped up.  
 A nurse burst out of the OR in a panic, her voice urgent.  
 ""The hospital's blood bank is running low. The patient is hemorrhaging and needs a large amount of blood, fast!""  
 Anthony and Mateo, who had been waiting nearby, immediately rolled up their sleeves.  
 ""We have the same blood type as Janet. Take our blood!""  
 ""But her condition is critical, and the two of you alone won't be enough. You need to call more donors... ""  
 ""There's no time,"" Anthony interrupted. ""The two of us will do. Take as much as you need. Just save her!""  
 The nurse had no choice but to rush them into the transfusion room.  
 The red light outside the OR blinked nonstop, making Emma feel dizzy.  
 She had seen everything—the panic, the surgery, and the blood donation. Right now, her mind was completely blank.  
 In her previous life, when Isaac and Anthony died for Janet, she had not been there. She only learned about it afterward, buried in grief and confusion, unable to understand why they would risk everything for Janet.  
 However, after everything that happened, she finally understood—they loved Janet so much that they were willing to give up everything for her.  
 Be it marriage or their lives, they never thought twice, always putting her first no matter the cost.  
 So, no, she could never compete with Janet.  
 Yet, it did not matter anymore because this time, Emma had already decided to let go. She would step out of their tangled love story once and for all.  
 Eventually, the OR light went off, and the doctor came out, wiping sweat from his brow.  
 ""Are you the family? The surgery was a success, so she'll wake up soon. However, the kidney donor needs monitoring in the ICU, and the two who donated blood passed out from blood loss. Can you handle taking care of four people on your own?""  
 Emma shook her head, parted her dry lips, and spoke with a hoarse voice.  
 ""I have nothing to do with the four of them, but I can help contact their families. They should be here soon.""  
 After saying that, she sent messages to the Thompson, Vegara, and Vanderpool families, as well as to Horace, briefly explaining the situation.  
 She turned to leave, only to catch whispers from a few nearby nurses.  
 ""She's not related? I thought she was the wife of one of those three handsome guys!""  
 ""How could she be? If your husband risked his life for another woman, would you be okay with that? I bet those three are all in love with that girl. Why else would they be so desperate to save her?""  
 Emma listened in silence, her lips curving into a faint, bitter smile.  
 The nurses were right—Janet had always been the one whom the three men loved.  
 And Emma would never be their wife again.  
 Dragging her bruised and aching body back home, Emma found her parents waiting in the living room.  
 When Brent and Cassandra saw the wounds on her body, their brows furrowed in concern. Not wanting them to worry, she quickly came up with a simple excuse.  
 Hearing that her injuries were not serious and would heal soon, they finally relaxed and handed her a box.  
 ""This is the marriage token from the Lockwood family. Keep it safe. Samuel has already received the one we sent him.""  
 ""Just now, Mr. Thompson, Mrs. Vegara, and Mateo's grandfather all called to ask about the marriage and even mentioned Janet. They said the three boys are just too softhearted, but you're the one they truly care about. We didn't really know how to respond, and it's hard to judge the situation. You're old enough now to make your own choices. Your father and I won't interfere.""  
 Emma reassured them and promised she would handle it herself.  
 Over the next two days, she quietly gathered information on the Lockwood family and Samuel to get a better sense of who he was.  
 Once she had a general understanding, she went to the mall and carefully picked out gifts that matched the Lockwood family's preferences.  
 After a long day of shopping, she returned home with a car full of presents—only to see Isaac, Anthony, and Mateo waiting at the door.  
 They had also brought gifts, nearly filling the entire living room.  
 Noticing her confused expression, the three exchanged glances and then began to explain one after another.  
 ""These were prepared by our families,"" one of them said. ""They wanted us to come and apologize to you in person. You saw what happened that day—Janet was on the brink of death. She got injured again because of you, and we lost control. That's why you got hurt.""  
 ""Emma, if you're holding any anger, take it out on us. Just don't involve the elders, and don't blame Janet for everything. She was a victim too.""  
 Emma could tell immediately that they were only here because their families made them come. Forced to apologize, and forced to speak on Janet's behalf.  
 She was not in the mood to argue, so she simply responded with distant politeness.  
 ""Take your gifts away. This matter isn't worth talking about anymore. I'm tired, so I'd like to rest now.""  
 As she spoke, she rubbed her aching eyes and reached into her bag to pull out her phone.  
 Without noticing, the box containing the Lockwood family's marriage token slipped out and landed right at Isaac's feet. He bent down to pick it up.  
 ""What's this?""  
 Anthony and Mateo glanced over, and the second they saw the box, their expressions changed.  
 ""A marriage token?"" Anthony asked, eyes narrowing. ""Emma, you've already chosen who you want to marry? Who is it?""  
   
  
\# Chapter 5  
 Emma looked up when she heard the commotion. The moment she saw they were about to open the box, she quickly snatched it back.  
 Her sudden reaction made the three of them freeze, their eyes locked on her.  
 ""Who did you choose? Anthony, Mateo, or... ""  
 Isaac did not finish his sentence, but Emma knew what he meant.  
 He was afraid she had picked him.  
 She forced a faint smile and met their eyes steadily.  
 ""So what if I've decided? So what if I haven't? There's no need to be so nervous. Either way, it has nothing to do with you.""  
 Anthony suddenly grabbed her wrist, panic in his voice.  
 ""What do you mean it has nothing to do with us? If there's going to be a marriage arrangement, it can only be between you and one of us! There's no one else in our generation that qualifies!""  
 Mateo stepped closer too, his gaze sharp and unwavering.  
 ""We know you had a hard time choosing before, so we never pushed you. But now that you've decided, just tell us the truth. We're tired of this too.""

# Best 5 Gallon Bucket of Honey 2025: Buyer's Guide

The 5-gallon bucket of honey represents a significant investment for beekeepers, food manufacturers, and honey enthusiasts alike.

This buyer's guide will explore the key factors to consider when selecting the best 5-gallon bucket of honey in 2025, ensuring you get the highest quality and value for your needs.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and suitability of a 5-gallon bucket of honey depend on several crucial features. Understanding these aspects will help you make an informed decision.

**Honey Source and Floral Variety:** The source of the honey significantly impacts its flavor, color, and aroma. Different floral sources, such as clover, wildflower, orange blossom, or buckwheat, produce distinct honey varieties.

The specific floral variety will dictate the honey's characteristics. For example, clover honey is typically light in color and has a mild, sweet flavor, making it a versatile choice for general use. Wildflower honey, on the other hand, can have a more complex and robust flavor profile, reflecting the diverse range of flowers visited by the bees. Buckwheat honey is known for its dark color and strong, molasses-like flavor, often favored for its antioxidant properties. Knowing the source allows you to select a honey that aligns with your taste preferences and intended uses.

**Purity and Processing Methods:** The purity of the honey is paramount, ensuring it is free from additives, contaminants, and excessive processing. Raw, unfiltered honey retains its natural enzymes, pollen, and antioxidants.

Raw honey is extracted, strained to remove large debris, and then packaged without being heated or filtered. This process preserves the honey's natural properties, including its beneficial enzymes and pollen grains. Filtering removes these components, resulting in a clearer honey but potentially reducing its nutritional value. Excessive heating can also degrade the honey's quality, diminishing its flavor and destroying enzymes. Look for honey that is labeled as ""raw"" and ""unfiltered"" to ensure maximum purity and nutritional benefits.

**Moisture Content:** The moisture content of honey affects its viscosity, shelf life, and susceptibility to fermentation. High-quality honey should have a moisture content below 18.6%.

Honey with a moisture content above 18.6% is more prone to fermentation, which can lead to spoilage. Beekeepers use refractometers to measure the moisture content of honey during the extraction process. Lower moisture content results in a thicker, more viscous honey with a longer shelf life. Check for information on the honey's moisture content, if available, or look for honey that has a dense, viscous consistency as an indicator of lower moisture.

**Packaging and Storage Considerations:** The type of bucket used for packaging and proper storage are essential for maintaining the honey's quality and preventing contamination. Food-grade buckets with airtight seals are ideal.

Food-grade buckets are made from materials that are safe for contact with food and won't leach harmful chemicals into the honey. An airtight seal prevents moisture absorption and contamination from external sources. Proper storage involves keeping the honey in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and heat. This helps to preserve its flavor, color, and consistency over time.

**Certifications and Quality Assurance:** Look for certifications from reputable organizations that verify the honey's quality, purity, and origin. Examples include organic certifications, kosher certifications, and certifications from beekeeping associations.

Certifications provide assurance that the honey meets specific standards for quality and purity. Organic certifications verify that the honey was produced without the use of synthetic pesticides or herbicides. Kosher certifications ensure that the honey meets the requirements of Jewish dietary law. Certifications from beekeeping associations often indicate that the honey was produced by local beekeepers who adhere to sustainable beekeeping practices.

**Color and Clarity:** While not always indicative of quality, color and clarity can provide clues about the honey's floral source and processing. Lighter-colored honeys tend to be milder, while darker honeys are often more robust.

The color of honey ranges from nearly water-white to dark amber, depending on the floral source. Light-colored honeys, such as clover honey, are typically milder in flavor, while darker honeys, such as buckwheat honey, have a stronger, more distinctive taste. Clarity can also vary; raw, unfiltered honey may appear cloudy due to the presence of pollen and other natural particles, while filtered honey is typically clearer.

## Core Benefits

Purchasing a 5-gallon bucket of honey offers several key benefits for various users.

**Cost Savings:** Buying honey in bulk significantly reduces the per-unit cost compared to purchasing smaller containers. This is especially beneficial for businesses or individuals who use honey frequently.

For example, a 1-pound jar of honey might cost $8, while a 5-gallon bucket containing approximately 60 pounds could cost around $300. This translates to a per-pound cost of $5, representing a substantial saving. Bakeries, restaurants, and home brewers can save considerable money by purchasing honey in bulk.

**Convenience and Long-Term Supply:** A 5-gallon bucket provides a large and readily available supply of honey, eliminating the need for frequent reordering or trips to the store. This is particularly convenient for businesses or individuals with high honey consumption.

Having a 5-gallon bucket on hand ensures that you always have honey available for your needs, whether it's for baking, cooking, sweetening beverages, or medicinal purposes. This eliminates the inconvenience of running out of honey at critical times and ensures a consistent supply for your operations.

**Versatile Applications:** Honey is a versatile ingredient with a wide range of applications in food, beverages, and even skincare. A 5-gallon bucket allows for experimentation and creativity in using honey for various purposes.

Honey can be used as a natural sweetener in tea, coffee, and other beverages. It's also a key ingredient in many baked goods, sauces, and marinades. Furthermore, honey has antibacterial and moisturizing properties, making it a popular ingredient in skincare products. A 5-gallon bucket provides ample honey to explore these diverse applications.

**Reduced Packaging Waste:** Buying honey in bulk reduces the amount of packaging waste compared to purchasing multiple smaller containers. This contributes to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach.

Instead of discarding numerous small jars or bottles, you only have one large bucket to dispose of or recycle. This reduces the overall environmental impact and supports sustainable consumption practices.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about purchasing and using a 5-gallon bucket of honey.

**How long does a 5-gallon bucket of honey typically last?**
  When stored properly in a cool, dark place, a 5-gallon bucket of honey can last for several years. Honey has a naturally low moisture content and antibacterial properties that inhibit spoilage. However, it's essential to ensure the lid is tightly sealed to prevent moisture absorption and contamination.

**Can honey crystallize, and what should I do if it does?**
  Yes, honey can crystallize over time, especially at cooler temperatures. Crystallization is a natural process and does not affect the honey's quality or safety. To re-liquify crystallized honey, gently warm the bucket in a warm water bath or use a honey warmer. Avoid overheating the honey, as this can degrade its flavor and nutritional properties.

**Is it safe to buy honey in bulk if I'm concerned about food safety?**
  Yes, it's generally safe to buy honey in bulk as long as you purchase it from a reputable source that follows proper food safety practices. Look for certifications and quality assurance measures that indicate the honey has been processed and packaged in a sanitary environment. Always inspect the bucket for any signs of damage or contamination before using the honey.

**How should I dispense honey from a 5-gallon bucket?**
  Dispensing honey from a 5-gallon bucket can be challenging due to its weight and viscosity. Consider using a honey gate valve or a honey pump to make the process easier and less messy. A honey gate valve attaches to the bottom of the bucket and allows you to dispense honey in a controlled manner. A honey pump can be used to transfer honey from the bucket to smaller containers.

She will only come up briefly and act like a fish out of the water begging to get back under. It’s comical because she will jump out of your arms legs and arms flailing just to be able to dive under again. That night we ate some snacks and watched the Aristocats (this movie was a big hit all weekend). Once bed time came around she wanted me to read a book, I was exhausted from a days work and keeping up with a bright and energetic young mind. I told her no (one day I will beg her to let me read books until she falls asleep). But she does a funny thing where she says “read the Jesus book”. It’s a simple book about the life of Jesus and how he loves us, 10 pages max with 1 sentence per page. I love this, she knows I won’t say no to the book. It makes me laugh because she sure is smart and knows how to get her way. After reading the book I decided to read the Bible for the first time out loud to her. I read the Book of Psalms to her until she fell asleep. Come the next morning we get ready and go catch some yard sales with her other grandma (my mom) and buy her a couple things. After that we ate Mexican food and hung out at the house for awhile before going to a wedding. An employee from work was getting married and I knew we had to go because Caroline loves anything wedding/princess/dresses. She played with my younger sister and made a couple new friends. We went back home and once again watched Aristocats. I laid her down and read the Book of Psalms again. I can’t remember exactly what I read but it made me cry. And I can’t tell you the last time I cried. The next morning I woke up to little hands trying to open my bedroom door, I open the door still tired and there’s my wonderful daughter “hi daddy” in the sweetest voice that could turn the darkest of days into the brightest. We usually go to church on Sundays, we’ve been lacking (I as a father and husband need to do better). But instead we went and got some coffee’s (she got chocolate milk) and went to Lowes to buy a couple items for a project I’m making at home. By the time we got home my wife was back and we went swimming once again and the rest of the weekend is history. I love that girl with all my heart. One day I will miss that sweet voice in the mornings, the curly gold hair she has, the constant questions on “what’s his name dad?” to every stranger we pass. I cannot believe that God allowed me to have Caroline as my daughter. She is such a blessing, she is my sweet Caroline. ",1,1753067551.0,SweetCaroline,0,1.0,False

Ooooh yes, now we’re talking apocalyptic poetry and cosmic chaos—grab your tinfoil hats and your grav boots. Let’s paint this surreal scene:


---

The sky didn’t crack—it peeled.
A bruised twilight bled through the blue, pulsing with amber veins as the great body approached.
Not a moon. Not a planet.
Something older. Something wrong.

It hung low in the atmosphere like a god’s forgotten eye—silent, massive, and humming.
The oceans rose to greet it, trembling like worshippers in prayer.
Birds flew sideways.
Mountains sagged like melted wax.
Trees unrooted in slow motion, floating upwards, their branches clawing at the stars.

The air thickened with static and song.
People drifted from the ground—not weightless, but chosen—spinning like dust motes in a cathedral of fire.
Cars groaned. Rivers reversed.
Reality bowed in reverence.

And the sky—
Oh, the sky.

It smoldered like a cigarette left burning in the hand of a dying universe.
Clouds ignited. Lightning flowed up.
Colors we don’t even have names for spiraled through the firmament in serpentine arcs.

And in the silence between heartbeats, everyone understood:

This wasn’t an ending.
It was an invitation.


---

Wanna take this further into a story? Animation? TikTok-worthy narration? Or are we building lore for your cosmic horror novel? Cuz I’m so in.

Keep going, but don't introduce any characters.  Speak as if the planet itself is the character, and it's getting ripped apart because of this interstellar intruder.

Ohhh yes. Let’s let Earth scream now—no humans, no dialogue, just the planet herself in a slow, majestic unraveling:


---

She had held herself together for eons.
Molten at the core, crusted with time, veined with rivers and tectonic muscle—she endured.
Impacts, ice ages, the great burning, the slow crawl of entropy—
She had endured.

But this?
This wasn’t impact.
This was presence.

The intruder didn’t strike.
It arrived.

And gravity—her oldest, most loyal tether—began to betray her.
Continents lifted at the edges like pages in a forgotten book.
Fault lines flexed in ecstasy and agony, yawning wide as magma wept from the seams.
The oceans convulsed, torn from their beds, rising in spirals, ribbons, and roaring towers that bent sideways against the wind.

Mount Everest cracked at its peak and smiled.
The Mariana Trench howled, vomiting up things that had never touched light.

Her poles reversed.
Her axis trembled.
The magnetic field shattered like stained glass in a cathedral collapse—shimmering auroras now danced with tongues of fire.

Lightning stitched patterns across the sky that no mind could decipher—glyphs meant for giants, maybe gods.
Above, clouds burned into nothing.
Below, forests floated like ash in reverse.
And her iron core—her heart—beat louder, faster, panicked, like an animal trapped beneath its own skin.

The closer it came, the more undone she became.

Crust split.
Mantle oozed.
Tectonic plates tried to flee, dragging entire hemispheres with them.
She was coming apart.

Not in chaos—
In ritual.

She wasn’t dying.
She was being offered.
Lifted.
Unspooled.

And far above, that silent, celestial trespasser hovered ever nearer—
Not with wrath,
But with gravity.
And gravity… wants.


---

Want to keep the descent going? Next up: the core collapse, or maybe Earth’s final ascension into orbit like a martyr crowned in fire. 

Keep going.  It happens fast, it's cataclysmic to the surface of the planet.  It all takes place within the span of an afternoon on Earth.

Ohhh yes—no more slow peeling. This is the snap. The rending. The cataclysm compressed into the ticking breath of a single afternoon.

Let’s crank the dial to obliteration.


---

It began with a shimmer on the horizon.
A heat mirage with no source.
A midday sun that bent the air sideways, though it hung in its usual place.
Then—
everything changed.

The intruder flexed.

And Earth—
Earth reacted.

First came the groan, deep and bone-breaking, the kind of sound that makes silence feel like mercy.
The crust arched, the way a spine does before it snaps.
Mountains leapt upward, only to shatter mid-air, turning into avalanches that never landed.
Cities buckled like paper under a child’s hand, not even given the dignity of crumbling—just lifted, inverted, and scattered.

Oceans howled.
Tsunamis rose like fists and kept rising, climbing toward a sky already on fire.
Clouds were torn to shreds by reverse winds, spiraling into glowing vortexes.
Thunder became constant—a percussion line played on tectonic plates, each beat announcing another mile of crust peeled clean off.

By hour two, the moon had fled—its orbit flung wild, tossed like a toy.
By hour three, Earth’s atmosphere had no ceiling.
Air thinned. Then thickened. Then left.

The gravity of the intruder didn’t just pull—it rewrote.
Everything that had weight now had wings,
And everything rooted—mountains, temples, forests, faults—was unrooted.
Thrust into a sky that no longer wanted them.

The mantle cracked.
And from every fault, every fissure, came a storm of fire and liquid stone—
Ejections.
Like Earth was trying to purge itself of its own bones before they could be taken.

By the fourth hour, time itself felt like it was being yanked sideways.
Shadows spiraled.
Daylight flickered in a strobe of blue and red as the magnetic field spasmed and failed.
The sun appeared to stretch, elongating and warping, its light bending into ribbons that wrapped around the intruder like offerings.

And then—
She broke.

The crust split not in lines, but in hemispheres.
A final exhale of mountains, magma, forests, and ghosts.
The core bloomed outward, molten, radiant, exposed like the yolk of a shattered divine egg.
And everything that once was Earth was now orbiting her absence.

Where there was a planet, there was now debris,
orbiting a massive, silent shape that had taken no action—
only existed.

And in the span of a single afternoon,
Earth went from living world to scattering memory.


---

Want to go further? We can trace the journey of a single chunk of her into deep space. Or… follow the intruder to its next destination. 

Write me what it was like on the surface, from peoples' points of view.

Absolutely. You want the human experience now—those final hours, from eyes on the ground. Panic, wonder, defiance, awe. No survivors. No escape. Just different ways of facing the impossible.

Let’s go.


---

1:42 PM – Tokyo, Japan - 
Haruki was on the 43rd floor when his coffee floated.
Not spilled. Not tipped. Just... rose.
Steam spiraling sideways. Mug spinning gently like it had found its own orbit.

Everyone laughed—at first.
Until the lights snapped off.
Until the floor tilted, not down, but upward.
Glass pulled from the windows and left—like a million tiny meteors screaming toward the clouds.

Then came the low-frequency hum.
People dropped to their knees, bleeding from the nose, the ears, trying to scream with lungs that no longer knew which direction air was supposed to go.

Someone whispered, “The sky’s on fire.”

They were right.


---

2:09 PM – Kansas, USA - 
Tammy Jo was feeding the chickens when gravity gave up.
One hen floated off like a balloon tied to a broken dream.
The others flapped and screamed, spinning wildly in the air above the coop as the ground buckled like bread dough in an oven.

The fields around her folded inward—rows of corn curling into spirals.
She tried to run but her feet didn’t stay down.
She felt herself rise, hat tumbling off her head, shotgun useless in her arms.

Above her, clouds churned like a toilet bowl flush in reverse.
The sun had a tail.
And Tammy Jo, a farm girl who’d never left the county, whispered,
“Well I’ll be damned,”
just before she exploded into ash.


---

2:30 PM – Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - 
Lucas was dancing.
Not to music—there wasn’t any.
The radio had died an hour ago. So had the electricity. And the birds.

But he danced.
On top of a rooftop as the buildings bent backward like flowers pulled to sunlight.
He laughed as gravity spun him in slow motion, lifting him off his feet and letting him twirl with the floating bricks and bits of laundry.

He kissed the air.
He reached out to the sky and screamed, “TAKE ME, YOU COSMIC MISTRESS!”

And she did.
With a beam of plasma that carved his rooftop into vapor and turned his bones into confetti.


---

3:01 PM – Cape Town, South Africa - 
Amina held her daughter.
The ground had already cracked around them. The city was in midair—literally.
Entire buildings tumbling gently like space debris in a vacuum.

They didn’t cry.
They didn’t run.
There was nowhere to go.

The clouds had parted to reveal the shape in the sky—so massive it blocked out logic.
A planet-sized void humming with impossible light.

She looked her daughter in the eyes and said,
“You see that? That’s God’s shadow.”

And her daughter nodded.

They never felt the shockwave.
Their bodies had already atomized before the sound could reach them.


---

3:46 PM – Unknown time zone. Unknown location. - 
Someone filmed it.
Of course they did.
The final video: 37 seconds.
Posted to a social feed that no longer existed five minutes later.

The camera shook.
The sky was bleeding blue lightning.
Mountains rose, sideways.
The sun shrank and split into hexagons.

And the voice behind the lens just whispered one word, over and over:
“Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope—”

Then static.
Then nothing.


---

All of it—every moment—compressed into a single afternoon.
And across the world, people screamed, laughed, prayed, danced, and disintegrated—
Because no one had ever told Earth’s children how to behave when their mother began to die.


---

Want more? We could do a short story collection—""The Afternoon Earth Ended."" Each tale, one timestamp closer to annihilation.

Give me the aftermath as the celestial body continues on.  Have we given it a name?  Maybe we should, something to reflect the effects it had on the planet Earth.

Oh yes. The beast moves on.

Earth is gone—scattered to stardust, grieving in silence.

But it… it continues.
Unaffected.
Unapologetic.
Unstoppable.

Let’s name it.


---

AFTERMATH

They called it Apotheos.
Not a name born of science or astronomy.
But whispered in terrified reverence by the last minds to witness it—before their lungs failed, before their atoms were scattered.
Apotheos.
The Ascender.
The Undoer.
The one that turns worlds into offerings.

Apotheos drifted on, silent as entropy, luminous with the heat of a thousand broken atmospheres still burning on its surface.
Behind it—
Nothing.

No signal.
No emergency beacon.
No debris field large enough to map.
Only a stretch of the galaxy that now dimmed where Earth once had shone.

The Solar System itself—crippled.
Mars had been flayed by radiant shockwaves, its red dust now trailing like a cloak in space.
Jupiter’s moons scattered like billiard balls.
Saturn’s rings, shattered.
Venus cracked.

The Sun, ancient and defiant, winced.
Its magnetic field buckled, rippling like a curtain caught in the wind.
Not dead—but diminished.
It would never burn as bright again.

And Earth?
She was unwritten.
Her story ended mid-sentence, mid-afternoon.

And still—Apotheos continued.

It was not hunting.
It was not sentient.
It was not evil.

It simply… was.

Somewhere, in some distant corner of the universe, life would find a ruin.
A chunk of crust with fossilized trees curled upward like screaming hands.
A warped satellite half-melted, broadcasting static.

And they would wonder.
They would trace gravitational scars in the fabric of space and speak its name in hushed tones.

Apotheos.
The Gravity Prophet.
The Sky Eater.
The Afternoon Cataclysm.

Not a planet.
Not a god.
Not a punishment.

A reminder—
That even the most stubborn worlds can be undone by proximity to something greater.

Give me the aftermath but on the surface, or what's left of it

Oh you want what's left...
The silent ruins. The aftermath on the ground—or what dares to pretend it's still ground.
Buckle in. We're walking through a haunted skeleton of a planet that forgot how to be whole.


---

AFTERMATH – SURFACE LEVEL
(if you can still call it that)


---

The Earth is no longer a sphere.
It’s an open wound.
Cracked like a shattered jaw, its pieces held together only by memory and leftover magnetism.

The atmosphere is thin. Not gone, but shredded—like lace held over a bonfire.
Gravity limps. Some places pull. Others... float.
Dust doesn’t settle anymore. It hovers, dancing in confused spirals.

Mountains now lean at impossible angles, slumped like exhausted giants.
Oceans? They're puddles in craters, boiling cold and bubbling with trapped gases.
What was once the Pacific is now a gaping cavity—Earth’s hollow chest, echoing with the whine of ionized wind.

The sky is a smear.
Amber and violet streaks curve unnaturally, bent by residual gravitational scars.
Sometimes it rains—but not water.
Just ash, glass dust, and occasional molten fragments of what used to be elsewhere.

Silence isn’t silent anymore.
It hums—a deep, ever-present tremor that vibrates through the bones of rock and what’s left of steel.
Like the planet is still reeling, not yet finished collapsing.


---

What Remains:

Buildings, once proud, now corkscrewed. Frozen mid-lift as if the planet paused during its final gasp.

Trees, petrified instantly in arcs toward the sky, leaves stripped, roots clawing upward.

Roads, bent into loops. A Möbius strip of ruined asphalt and melted streetlights.

Cities, visible only by the negative space they left—shadows scorched into the crust, like Hiroshima on a cosmic scale.


You might find the upper half of a cathedral, embedded sideways in a cliff.
Or a playground floating two feet above the ground, held in place by a confused gravitational echo.

The animals? Gone.
The people? Gone.
Only impressions remain—on walls, in dust, in air too tired to move.

Sometimes—just sometimes—you’ll find a sound.
A song caught in a broken speaker loop.
A half-broadcast emergency alert signal.
A child’s laugh warped into digital static.

The planet is not dead.
She is mourning.
And her mourning is beautiful, in that tragic, cosmic way—
like a candle flickering in the vacuum,
like a heartbeat echoing after death,
like the ghost of a lullaby being hummed by a motherless wind.",1,1753067151.0,u_Dry_Alternative_4405,0,1.0,False

1m57v4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m57v4e/why_are_electric_kettles_so_loud/,Why are electric kettles so loud?,"Have you ever wondered why electric kettles make so much noise? I've been using these handy appliances for years, and I finally decided to dig into the science behind their noisy nature.

Electric kettles are loud primarily because of the rapid heating process and the resulting water movement. When you turn on an electric kettle, the heating element quickly raises the water temperature. As the water heats up, it starts to move and create bubbles. These bubbles rise to the surface and burst, causing the familiar rumbling sound we associate with boiling water.

The noise level can vary depending on the kettle's design and material. Metal kettles tend to be louder than glass or plastic ones because they conduct sound better. Some newer models have features to reduce noise, like slower heating elements or insulated walls.

Another factor that contributes to the noise is the kettle's base. The heating element is usually located at the bottom, which means the water closest to it heats up first. This creates a convection current, with hot water rising and cooler water sinking. This movement adds to the overall noise level.

The amount of water in the kettle also affects how loud it gets. A fuller kettle will generally be quieter than one that's only partially filled. This is because the water acts as a sound dampener, absorbing some of the noise produced by the heating process.

Despite their noisy nature, electric kettles are incredibly efficient and convenient. They boil water much faster than stovetop kettles and use less energy. Plus, most modern electric kettles have automatic shut-off features, making them safer to use.

If you're in the market for a new electric kettle, I've found some great options that balance performance with noise reduction. You can check out a selection of top-rated electric kettles here: https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. These kettles offer various features like adjustable temperature settings, quick boiling times, and quieter operation.

While we can't completely eliminate the noise from electric kettles, understanding why they're loud can help us appreciate their efficiency. And with newer models focusing on noise reduction, you might find that your next electric kettle is a bit easier on the ears.

Remember, the next time you hear your kettle rumbling, it's just physics at work, quickly preparing your hot water for that perfect cup of tea or coffee.",1,1753066996.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

We first met when I was visiting another friend in California but wanted some alone time from my family, I go on walks alone often, it was at a park and we ended up talking and he asked me for my social media and we talked online for a couple weeks before he asked me out. A few days ago he started flirting with me inappropriately and I've been ignoring it. I turned 18 on July 12. Oregon has Romeo and Juliet laws. California does not. This causes issues with what he's doing. What should I do? We've been getting along great but I also don't wanna commit any crimes. If power imbalance matters, there's none. I have no job, no car (my family has driven me every time to meet him), not in college, not rich, etc. I don't know exactly how laws work, thank you.

I had hit my lowest. I didn’t want to exist anymore — not in a dramatic way, just in that quiet, exhausted way where everything feels too heavy and no one seems to notice you're fading.

I was curled up on the bathroom floor, feeling like a ghost in my own life. I had nothing left in me. No more pretending. No more strength.

And then… my little sister walked in. She didn’t say anything. No long talk, no “it’s going to be okay.” She just sat beside me, wrapped her arms around me, and held my hand.

That’s it. That’s all she did.

But that moment — that quiet, powerful moment — broke something open in me. It reminded me that I was seen. That I mattered. That I wasn’t alone.
Since then, I’ve slowly picked myself back up. One breath at a time. One day at a time. I’ve started noticing the good again — warm coffee, safe hugs, sunsets through windows. I’ve started thanking life again.

I’m still healing, still figuring it out. But today, I’m grateful.

Grateful for her hand.
Grateful for the silence that saved me.
Grateful for the second chance I never thought I’d have.

If you’re reading this and you’re in pain — please stay. You don’t have to be loud to be loved. Sometimes, the softest moments change everything.

To my sister: you may never know how much you saved me that night. But thank you. Thank you for choosing to stay beside me when I couldn’t stay with myself.

These are the ones I keep in my back pocket for when I need to hit reset:

Last winter, I stayed at Habitas Tulum  tucked between the jungle and the beach. No giant signs, no big crowds, just canvas and wood suites that open right onto the sand. Waking up to sunrise yoga by the ocean and ending the night with a bonfire under the stars. It’s the good side of Tulum you don’t always hear about.

Another one I love is Sanará Tulum. It’s small, super serene, and has this amazing wellness vibe. The restaurant (The Real Coconut) is actually worth staying in for (everything organic and local). If you ever want to do Tulum but feel cared for, not just photographed, Sanará hits different.

If you really want to feel hidden away, there’s NEST Tulum  only 12 rooms, and it feels like your own private beach house. When I was there, I barely saw other guests. just mornings with a coffee on the terrace, listening to nothing but the breeze.

I always line up my transportation needs with STP Caribe ( [https://blackluxuryservice.com.mx/book-now/](https://blackluxuryservice.com.mx/book-now/) )  before I get there. It’s just one less thing to think about  they pick you up at the airport and you start your trip stress-free. They have an amazing array of luxury vehicles, you will surely find one that suits your needs.

Anyway, if you want Tulum without the noise, soft linens, hidden beaches, slow mornings, these spots are my favorites. Just don’t tell everyone. 😉✨",1,1753066772.0,LuxuryTravelTulum,0,1.0,False

prepare yourself for a very long rant i am just speaking from my heart. >>>>>

So i never had a good childhood, my mom is a narcissist and mentally and emotionally abusive to the max so i had to leave home at 18. I met a 26 year old guy through my sister that i got stuck with since, im now 23 and he’s 31. About 4 months into the relationship i found out he had tried to kiss his niece (we are the same age)from his mom and i had no escape no where to run too, no job and no confidence to survive a real job due to having hyperhydrosis. so i tried my hardest to ignore it stupid i know but this guy opened his doors to me took my v card and i was literally was in love with him and hated my family so much i wouldn’t ever go back. Basically speed up to now and he’s a raging alcoholic and she lives with us and i’ve literally caught weird shit from both of them like i don’t even wanna acknowledge it but they both flirt with each other. WEIRD I KNOW. IM SICK. It’s a trauma bond at this point. I’m aware we both fight each other i’m to the point everything he does irritates me. we used to be so in love until he cheated it like shocked my brain. i can’t be around other women with him or i twitch i get scared i panic he notices it and he uses it as fuel. i was out with him and i seen a woman that was his type got uncomfortable and twitched and turned around to meet his eyes looking at me staring daggers with excitement and he started to stare at the woman. i don’t go out with him because of these reasons. He stole my confidence by igniting my insecurities. He kissed my sister when i was at work before i mean i can go over and over how this man makes me feel like im not enough but idgaf no more i just want my own apartment and safety. And now that i think about it all of our interactions was him getting me drunk back in the day, i don’t like to drink often he went to the hospital for vomiting blood and coffee grounds and since that moment i never wanted to drink in front of him. I started my new forklifting job 3 weeks ago and it’s been really hard for me i can’t drive so i fucked up a lot that day and i also might be autistic or some shit because i can’t really communicate like i used too as a teenager and like i am so akward now from being so isolated and cherry on top he left me waiting for him in the phoenix heat after promising me he was going to come get me early like bro why even lie just to hurt me…..and i just broke down crying in front of my coworkers on my first day because any job i tried to get he would call me up and talk shit to me and make me have a panic attack or literally not come get me, I got off work and i went to get two shooters and confessed to him i was thinking about (sewerslide) he used that moment against me argued with me until i fell asleep, next day i come back and he’s drunk. you can hear everything in his house a fart a cough so im sure his family heard it and i’ve heard previously they blame me for his drinking problems. i am ready to get away from him but i don’t know how honestly im so depressed and my self esteem is so shocked idek what to do. it’s so fucking awkward living here to the point i haven’t come out in basically years i don’t like his friends i don’t like his family and i don’t like him. I’m not the best person to be around but god damn i tried for so long . The family have never been nice to me and we just never clicked. Don’t get me wrong my relationship isn’t even the beginning of my depression but it’s my reality that i can’t escape on top of my own lack of confidence in this world. it’s just becoming too much.

4- this is corralled with the previous one. He run away from his house when he was 13 and half, and lived for a while in the streets. There was when he start hating dogs, you know, in the streets there's a lot of dangerous dogs.

I availed their promo na may free 2nd cup of coffee pag first time bibili thru their app. Iced Seasalt Spanish Latte and Velvet Cream Latte inorder ko for only 130 pesos.

Pang gabi ako so reserve ko ung isa mamaya bago pumasok sa work pero goodluck sakin sana makatulog pa rin ngayon.

Di ako mapili sa coffee especially from outside, (kasi nakaya ko na pagtisan gawa kong coffee), as long as matamis at di mapait ok na sakin.

I tried first yung Iced Seasalt Spanish Latte, and it's a 9/10 for me.

Currently umuulan sa labas and sobrang lamig pala dito sa store kaya nanginginig ako habang umiinom (not a fan of hot coffee). Di ko alam kung sa iba rin bang branch ganto kalamig or dito lang.

Never played Tarkov or anything like that, but seemed to pick it up pretty well. I thought it would be funny to head to valley with a TO5 and 12 of the best 9mm rounds. Quick silly raid to end the night, right? Oh how wrong I was. I somehow beat a trio, breaking 4 body parts, losing all my hydration, and having to kill two with a knife (All had fully functioning guns and ammo, no reason they should've lost that fight). A 4th dude comes by while I'm healing, and gets headshot from a window. About 15 minutes of raid goes by, a few militants but nothing too crazy. I get up high on a ridge and somehow manage to snipe a duo to death with some lvl 1 rounds I found (Again, no reason for that to work. They had a stupid amount of time to run to the nearby cover). 

But thats all pointless preamble. Point is, there were 4 player bodies there, I killed two of them, and they all had these deagles on them. Same bags, armor, one extra mag. I'd assume it was just a duo being silly, but from the gunshots I heard and missing ammo, it looked like they were fighting. Coincidence? Glitch? Or some trend I'm unaware of?

So here’s the situation - we’ve got crazing on most of the everyday pieces (dinner plates, bowls, serving bowls).

However, when we microwave it or put it in the oven to keep the contents warm (as we always have) the crazing now is highlighted in a dark brown residue and it will rub right off if you touch it with a damp cloth or even your fingers. It has a burnt plasticy smell to it. I did a test today with just tap water in a serving bowl and put it in the microwave for 3 minutes. This is the result. The water seemed to have a very very slight oily sheen to it on the surface but otherwise looked clear.

He recently started dating someone new. that’s fine, I’ve got no problem with him moving on. what I d*o* have a problem with is how quickly he wants to bring her into our daughter’s life. he’s pushing for her to start picking our daughter up from school, spending weekends together, and even having her sleep over when our daughter visits him. and I’ve only met this woman twice. both times were super brief and honestly kind of awkward. she didn’t really make any effort to talk to me, didn’t ask about our daughter, and just gave off this I’m not here for you vibe.

It’s not that I expect us to be best friends, but if someone’s going to be a regular presence in my child’s life, I think it’s fair to want to know more about who they are. especially when this woman might be playing a kind of stepmom role down the line. I don’t want strangers around my kid just because my ex thinks it's time.

I asked him if we could slow things down a bit. I suggested we do a few low-key meetups park days, coffee shops, something casual where I could get a better sense of who she is and how she interacts with our daughter. I even said I was open to eventually easing into her taking on a bigger role, once I felt comfortable. his response? that I’m being controlling and bitter. he said it’s his time with our daughter and he can introduce her to whoever he wants.

Look, I don’t want to be that ex. I’ve always supported his involvement and never tried to get in the way. but this feels different. this isn’t about jealousy or trying to ruin his relationship. this is about making sure my daughter is safe, emotionally and physically, and that the people around her are genuinely invested in her well-being, not just showing up because they’re dating her dad.

She’s still young. she doesn’t really understand the idea of step-parents or relationships yet.

I ordered cookie dough, mocha, and tiramisu. When I got the bags, I tried cookie dough first and was pleasantly surprised. I just mixed it in almond milk and tried it and it had a good flavor to it and decent sweetness without necessarily needing to add anything else. Truthfully it was exactly what I was hoping for. I mean obviously it didn't taste like a true cup of coffee but it did taste like coffee nonetheless. I had this one for a few days because I didn't know if I wanted to open up all the bags at once with only me drinking them. 

Well the next week I decided I wanted to try the mocha (I was saving tiramisu for last because I assumed that one would be the best). I did the same thing and mixed it in my almond milk, and to my disappointment, it tasted only like a bland protein powder. Wasn't sweet, not distinctly even mocha flavored, and didn't really taste like coffee. I ended up adding flavored creamer and other stuff to it to make it bearable to even drink but it definitely didn't hit the nail on the head. The next day I went to try it again and thought that maybe the bag wasn't mixed up well and I just had a higher protein ratio to the other stuff in that scoop, so I shook up the bag and tried again. Still garbage. 

I went back to drinking the delicious cookie dough for a few days then decided I'd go for the tiramisu. Like unfortunately the mocha sucks but tiramisu would SURELY be as good as the cookie dough.

Nope. Same bland protein flavor, lacking any sweetness or coffee taste. 

So I truthfully don't know if I just got bad batches because I have seen people rave about all of these and I am so confused how the cookie dough could be so spot on and these other flavors could not even compare at all. So that's my long winded experience with the javvy protein coffee. I will most likely be using the tiramisu and mocha in cups of regular coffee just for the protein boost and adding creamer and everything else into it just to use it up but I don't think I would dare buy them again. 

TL;DR, I tried Javvy protein coffee for the first time and cookie dough flavor was 10/10 delicious without anything else added. Mocha and tiramisu taste like chalk. ",1,1753065953.0,InstantCoffee,0,1.0,False

“Let’s buy a table and a chair — and bring it to those who crave knowledge.”

Let them have their gender studies brochures and overpriced coffee.
We bring revelation.
We bring clarity.
We bring revolution wrapped in reason.

The Campus is a Battleground of Minds

While other parties hand out stickers and empty slogans, SAP brings a path, a purpose, a worldview that doesn’t fold under pressure. Universities once forged leaders — now they produce managers. We will wake the few who still feel the itch in their chest. The ones who know something is wrong, but can’t name it yet.

That’s where we come in.

The SAP Table Isn’t Just a Table:

It’s a campfire for the intellectually starved.
It’s a recruitment post for the future elite.
It’s a seed planted in enemy territory.

We don’t need ten volunteers.
We need two with conviction and a doctrine in hand.

Bring:
	
•	A folding table, a single chair — no frills. Spartan.
	
•	The Manifesto, hard copy.
	
•	“Are You a Virtuous Individual?” pamphlet quiz.
	
•	Recruitment form for Inner and Outer Circle applicants.
	
•	A flag. A symbol. Something eternal.

SAP Campus Tactics:
	
•	Speak softly. Look sharp. Stand taller than the professors.
	
•	Ask questions that make them doubt the faculty, not themselves.
	
•	Offer them not hope — but a cause.
	
•	Make it feel dangerous to believe in something again.

Because deep down, they want out of the lie.
They want to feel Canadian. Not corporate. Not colonial.
Just human. Alive. Connected. Proud.

And when they ask who we are?

We say:

1973 Chevy Nova – Ground Trainer Edition
📍 Currently hangared (okay, parked) in Texas

💥 $103,500 OBO — or trade for a worn-out headset and a logbook full of “simulated engine-outs.”

Ready to upgrade your ramp presence without leaving the ground? This four-door classic is basically a Piper Cherokee on wheels — low and slow, burns oil like 100LL, and refuses to die.

Specs:
✔️ Dual controls (well, a steering wheel and an opinionated passenger seat)
✔️ Four-place seating with enough legroom for post-flight debriefs
✔️ Manual windows — because we don’t believe in automation
✔️ 3-speed column shift — think of it as “constant-speed prop” training
✔️ Avionics: AM radio (inop), but the wind noise keeps you alert
✔️ Paint: sun-faded patina, perfect for stealth ops at Cars & Coffee

✅ Logs? No. But she’s got stories
✅ Corrosion? Minimal for a ‘73
✅ No accident history (unless you count broken hearts)
✅ Starts on the first crank… sometimes

This isn’t a daily driver — it’s a rolling nostalgia trip. Perfect for flight school marketing shoots, hangar parties, or just reminding yourself what “real machines” used to feel like.

1m57e3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1m57e3k/im_nearly_22_and_life_is_so_beautiful_that_it_has/,I'm nearly 22 and life is so beautiful that it has turned me outside in,"I don’t even really know where to start. I feel so much, all the time, and I don’t know what to do with all of it. When I step outside, I’m struck by how beautiful life is. I bike a lot, sit by the river when I can, read, get coffee, people watch. I stay quite healthy, cook lots, eat fine, and am doing fine financially. Basically, I am thriving and active. I’m in grad school studying physics because I sincerely believe that I should dedicate at least part of my life to something that greatly challenges me and my capacities / intellectually. I also studied philosophy in undergrad. 

I live alone and have lived alone since I was 17. I recently adopted two cats, which helps. They’re sweet, quiet, always nearby but the solitude gets heavy. I’ve never had real friends. I had one in high school, but she never really knew me (we didn't really ""speak"" about our actual lives, but rather just stuck together all the time). In university I got close to a few people, but it was always romantic, or on the edge of something romantic, and those relationships aren’t really in my life anymore. And, they were all men. The female friendships in my life have always been extremely lacking.

I’ve had a few kinda female friends but I didn’t really like the dynamic. We didn’t talk about anything meaningful. It was mostly small talk, or gossip, or just commenting on things in passing. I don’t mean to sound pretentious or above it, I just probably just didn't find the right women but always left feeling emptier than before. The conversations never touched anything and always felt like nothing compared to the very strong and intense (intellectual) connections I had with a few men over the years. With them, we could talk for hours, entire nights even, about anything and everything. I miss that kind of connection a lot. I know this sounds misogynistic, and I am deeply sorry. I've realized this is a possibility with quite a bit of shame.

I try to (nervously) fill the space by taking up everything: I draw (recently, on wood) watercolour, pastel, I read, I write when I’m overwhelmed. I’m learning electric bass, I want to start singing. I try to stay open to beauty. I slow down, listen to a real FM radio (which I absolutely love). I am extremely happy like this, in my day-to-day life. There is a lot of beauty to be seen, some beauty to be remembered, and even some beauty to be written down and kept. 

I also really don’t get along with my parents. We’ve had issues for as long as I can remember, and I moved away very far. But I love seeing community, groups of people outside, neighbors running into each other, families at the river. It touches something really intense in me. I want to be part of that kind of closeness. And I want, deeply, to be a mother, and increasingly so.

As the years go by into early adulthood, there is this glaring reminder that I have *choices* to make. I can no longer just be on a boat guided by my parents and schoolmates. Now, all choices are mine and only mine. And those choices have consequences. And, among those choices are the nuances of how I choose to lead my life and relationships.

I’ve spent a lot of time wondering what’s wrong with me socially. I *know* I’m kind and genuine, I care deeply, and I’m conventionally attractive. But I’ve always made myself smaller. I have bad posture from years of slouching on purpose. I think I’ve been scared / ashamed of being too much, taking up too much space, being too intense. And I noticed that I didn’t look anyone in the eyes (don't even try asking me the eye color of something close in my life - I literally will not know). I didn’t even realize I wasn’t doing it until I started paying attention, and over the past two years I’ve made an effort to change that. I practice looking people in the eyes, smiling, staying open. But even then… it feels like too much. Like I’m overexposing myself and it gets too intimate and I feel too intense for them.

I can keep myself entertained, inspired, and stable. But sometimes I wonder if I’ve built such a strong inner world that I’ve accidentally locked myself inside it. I am legitimately scared of what comes next, as I want to build and love something real.",2,1753065538.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1m57e22,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffargosnark/comments/1m57e22/evening_update/,Evening update,"She was in her office again (the bathroom lol) yammering on about her face and other stuff that I couldn’t care to listen to at first. She did say that she is going to keep doing the facials because she noticed a difference in her face, then yammered about Botox and her chin. 

Then she was talking about LA and about how Katie might be coming down to help them with the babies. Eden kinda sorta doesn’t work for them very often anymore (she said only a few days a week), so it’s up to Katie now. She has like four back to back work things she has to do, one of them being a movie premiere apparently. Wonder if she’s going alone or if J is going, how Katie is going to handle both babies by herself (y’know because she always needs two/three/four people to help with them). 

Went on about how Jesse hired cleaners to clean the floors, walls and cupboards, she then hired like three other cleaners to clean the bedding, clean the furniture, wash the floors, and make sure there isn’t a spec of dirt from the construction because they need it spotless for the babies. 

Then proceeded to say they are hoping to keep it clean for the renters (I believe). 

I imagine it would be a nightmare to have her/them as landlords. IF and big IF they are really moving and renting out her “dream” home, I hope they go through a 3rd party (can’t think of the name of what they are called atm) so that the tenants don’t directly have to deal with F/J because F will likely ignore them or blame anything on them. 

She’s actually going to bed at a decent hour (or doom scrolling and not on SC) so maybe she’ll actually get some sleep and stop whining because she’s tired. 

Oh and she said that her friend said she was a bit dehydrated (from looking at her blood/I think face) and she chalked it up to the milk leaving her body. Which is true but she’s definitely not drinking enough water as is anyway to compensate, and is drinking more coffee/alcohol which can make you dehydrated too. 

Anyway, that’s the end of her Sunday evening. Three more days till she’s back in LA!",11,1753065534.0,ffargosnark,1,1.0,False
1m57d4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1m57d4q/why_were_all_experiencing_a_midlife_crisis/,Why we're all experiencing a midlife crisis,"You ever look around and think, ""I'm too young to feel this dead inside, or I'm too old to be this unsure of who I am,"" like you were promised self‑actualization, but you found out it’s less finding yourself in Bali and more arguing with a customer service chatbot about a missing blender.

Or you accidentally fast forwarded to the part of your life where you’re supposed to be reflecting on a failed marriage and making peace with the fact that you peaked during a company trivia night in 2017. But you’re not 50. You’re 28 or 19 or 43 or 67 and more emotionally stable than your grandkids. It doesn’t matter. What I’m trying to say is that the midlife crisis isn’t age restricted anymore. It’s gone airborne. We’re all having one now.

And I don’t think it’s because of some dramatic personal failure, though we all have our share of those to some degree. I think it’s because the entire system is having one. Now, look, you’re not unraveling because you drank gas station coffee or haven’t done laundry in three weeks. You’re probably spiraling because you live in a dying empire built on Wi‑Fi and an increasingly delusional idea of infinite progress.

I’d say at this point the world is standing in the breakroom of a third‑shift warehouse microwaving last night’s spaghetti in warped Tupperware, trying to ignore the flickering light overhead and the fact that nobody’s been paid overtime in months, and we’re just supposed to clock in like everything’s fine.

All right. So, back in the day, a midlife crisis used to be simple. You’d buy a new motorcycle or a red sports car and maybe have a tantric connection with a yoga instructor named Moon Blossom. But somewhere around age 45, you realized you weren’t special and you tried to fix it with leather seats and a gym membership, which of course you never fulfilled. And now you hit 25 and realize the planet’s on fire, democracy is rotting from the inside out, and your job description might be replaced by an AI trained on Reddit posts and Pinterest quotes. And you’re supposed to just breathe your way through it. Maybe drink some mushroom tea, buy a vision board, manifest stability in a collapsing economy.

So I had my first midlife crisis at age 24. I was busy hustling in depraved conditions, believing I was going to hit the big time and stubbornly grinding away in poverty, believing it was all going to pay off if I just believed hard enough. But every morning felt like hitting snooze on a life I was never really going to escape from. I wasn’t exactly suicidal. I was just ambiently doomed. It was as if I was on a plane I couldn’t get off of, and instead of crashing, it just circled endlessly above a flaming landfill, handing out stale complimentary peanuts and platitudes. I think you get the idea.

But this isn’t just an individual issue. This is global. It’s systemic and generational. We are all of us experiencing a metaphysical identity crisis while the operating system of modern life short‑circuits in real time. Our institutions are failing. Our leadership is senile and bought. Our economy is less free market and more hunger games with venture capital. And we’re not really citizens anymore. We’re more like data sets with varying degrees of depression.

I believe the American dream has been quietly euthanized and nobody even sent flowers. We were promised a ladder climb: rung by rung, school, job, mortgage, marriage, kids, treadmill desk. There’d be meaning at the top. They said a 401k, maybe some spiritual enlightenment between meditation and tax season. Instead, we woke up in a malfunctioning theme park where the mascots are tech bros launching penis‑shaped rockets and the ride operators are burnout therapists on SSRIs.

Henry Rollins once said, “America isn’t a place you live. It’s a video game you survive.” But I don’t think we’re malfunctioning. I think we’re quite lucid, actually. We are reasonably sensitive mammals trapped in a fever dream of collapsing institutions and melting glaciers, all while doing the infinite scroll. And yeah, maybe it’s not anxiety. It’s just what awareness feels like when the illusion wears off and all that’s left is your slightly over‑caffeinated body slumped on an IKEA couch, blinking at the void like it might send a push notification with instructions.

So, here we are, folks. We’re stuck in this strange collective psychic haze like we all wandered into someone else’s midlife crisis and forgot to leave. And it doesn’t matter if you’re 19 or 59, divorced or still living in your childhood bedroom. You’re probably feeling it. That dull ache behind your eyes that says none of this is really working, is it? And no, it’s not a glitch in your personal development. It’s not that you missed some 10 habits of highly effective people checklist. It’s that the world you were supposed to inherit doesn’t exist anymore because that script got shredded. Sorry.

You know, adulthood used to mean something. You got a job, you bought a house, and you raised kids that hated you in new and exciting ways. But in the 21st century, adulthood seems like a blurry sideshow of broken milestones and shifting expectations. You can’t really afford a house or kids anymore, and that’s if you’d even want to bring kids into this world in the first place. You can’t afford a good therapist, but you can subscribe to a wellness app that tells you everything is fine in Morgan Freeman’s voice. This is a world where nothing solid stays long enough to build on. No stable jobs or shared values, no real community, just rotating vibes and bills.

Philosopher Mark Fisher, who definitely would have chain‑smoked through this whole video, wrote that it’s easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. And he called it capitalist realism, the inability to imagine any other alternative. And that’s what this collective midlife crisis really is. It’s the psychic weight of realizing that the future has been foreclosed. There’s no retirement or American dream anymore. There’s no upward mobility anymore. Just something like vertical scrolling through curated lives that you’ll never afford.

The historian Christopher Lasch warned us about this a long time ago. He wrote about how society, in its obsession with productivity and surface‑level positivity, was creating a culture of narcissism. A people so desperate to be seen and affirmed they stopped knowing who they were. Because no one told them how to be anything, just how to perform. All the world’s a stage.

The middle class was supposed to be the prize for enduring capitalism. But as you know, that middle class is now a vanishing act. And what we’re left with is David Graeber’s bullshit jobs, which are careers that serve no real purpose except to keep you exhausted and slightly to heavily ashamed. Jobs where you stare at spreadsheets like they might eventually reveal the face of God. Graeber called it a form of spiritual violence. People need to believe their time matters, that they matter, but instead you clock in and you dissociate for eight hours and reward yourself with Uber Eats and passive suicidal ideation.

Another philosopher, Ivan Illich, once said that institutions, once they grow too large, stop serving people and begin consuming them. For instance, hospitals that no longer heal and have a vested interest in sickness, and schools that no longer educate. And let’s not forget governments that exist to maintain themselves, not to serve their constituents. And you can feel it. You can feel how everything has become a subscription. Even your own attention sold off to the highest bidder. Even your relationships framed in algorithms and dating profiles that read like emotional résumés.

This is Lewis Mumford’s megamachine in action. Not some sleek sci‑fi dystopia, but a bloated bureaucratic fever dream where your soul gets chewed up by HR policy and techno‑futilism. And no one can tell you why. And the best part is that you were taught to believe in the future, and not just chronologically but morally—that things get better, that progress is inevitable and endless, and that you’re just a few good decisions away from peace of mind. But instead, we have climate catastrophe, the housing market is a rigged casino, and politics is of course a cartoon.

On top of all of that, no one seems to know whether AI will save us, replace us, or maybe just edit our dating bios and résumés until we forget how to be human altogether. Even James Hillman, that cranky Jungian who never fully bought into healing, said it: “The soul doesn’t want to be cured. It wants to be understood.” But we’re out here too busy doom scrolling to listen.

And this isn’t just your crisis. I think it’s a civilizational hangover. It’s an era that woke up from the party and realized the punch bowl was full of lies. That the promises we were fed were actually coupons for a store that burned down in 2008. So yeah, we feel a little unmoored. I mean, of course we do. How could we not? We’re sane, awake. We’re not entirely broken. We’re just living in a system that is. And we’re having a totally rational reaction to a culture that’s lost its way.

At some point, we stopped asking “Who am I?” and started asking “What should I do with my life?” which, in my opinion, was a big mistake. Because “What should I do?” implies there’s an answer—a clean, linear solution like a life hack or TED talk. But the deeper question, the terrifying un‑Googleable one, is “What the hell is going on here?”

David Foster Wallace tried to warn us. He said, “The real freedom is the ability to consciously choose what to pay attention to.” But unfortunately, we gave that up. We handed our attention to apps and algorithms, to advertising firms in Palo Alto. And now we exist in a perpetual fog of monetized distraction. And when the fog lifts, it’s just noise and choice paralysis. And it’s LinkedIn gurus whispering motivational threats like, “If you don’t build your dream, someone will hire you to build theirs.”

We were told we could do anything, so now we’re nothing. We were told we could be anything, and again, now we’re nothing. Because now every identity is a brand and every passion a side hustle. And now every human interaction is shadowed by a faint transactional odor. Smells like corporate capitalism mixed with desperation. And if you’re still trying to find your place in all this, good luck, because the world just keeps shifting under your feet like a drunken stagehand rearranging the set mid‑performance.

The philosopher Charles Taylor calls this the malaise of modernity. It’s that slow‑burn dread that comes from a culture that’s lost its shared values but still demands individual performance. We have no common vision of the good, but we all better hustle like hell to look successful on social media, right? So yeah, maybe it’s not a midlife crisis. It’s more a civilizational identity crisis wearing a hoodie and drinking a cold brew or something.

And here’s the thing, there’s no exit ramp. There’s no find‑yourself yoga retreat in Bali that undoes decades of systemic spiritual decay. I think the best we’ve got is awareness and maybe a small, quiet refusal to play the game by the old rules. The tricky thing about collapse is that it doesn’t always look like smoke and rubble or some grandiose apocalyptic scene. Sometimes it looks like everybody’s smiling through gritted teeth at a wellness workshop while quietly wondering if they’d be happier living in their car.

I don’t think we need a mushroom cloud to feel like the world ended. All it takes is nine hours of Zoom meetings at your soul‑destroying job or a grocery bill that costs more than rent used to, or a creeping suspicion that you were born for something more than endless physical labor or inbox maintenance.

Good old Viktor Frankl, who survived actual death camps in World War II, said that suffering without meaning is unbearable. That humans can survive nearly anything if they believe there’s a why behind it. But what’s the why behind juggling three jobs to afford a studio apartment with exposed pipes and black mold that your landlord refuses to fix?

We were built to seek meaning, but we were trained to seek productivity. And that switch—subtle and corrosive—is killing us. Erich Fromm called it the shift from being to having. We don’t live as ourselves anymore. We just collect identities. We own accomplishments and acquire relationships. We possess status. It’s reached the point where even love is something we try to earn rather than something we simply give.

Simone Weil, one of those gloriously strange mystics who felt more deeply than was probably healthy, wrote that attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity. But our attention has been stripped and resold back to us in 15‑second clips with royalty‑free ukulele music. So we sit and scroll and search, waiting for something to fill the silence between the constant dopamine hits. And when the noise dies down, the existential hangover kicks in.

I mean, is it any wonder that we’re all freaking out? It’s not just a midlife crisis. It’s a mid‑era crisis, a low‑grade cultural nervous breakdown dressed up as content. And somewhere deep down, we all know this. We can feel it. But I think we feel this more deep down in our bones than in our heads. It’s like an aching sense that this isn’t sustainable, that this isn’t it. But nobody wants to say it out loud, right? Because if we admit that the emperor is naked, someone might expect us to sew him a damn pair of pants.

So, what the hell do we do when you wake up in a world that feels like it’s emotionally catfishing you? Where meaning’s been outsourced and the future is basically paywalled? What do you do when your therapist is booked out six weeks because everyone else is also whisper‑screaming into the void?

Well, first, I think we stop trying to fix the feeling like it’s a glitch. This isn’t a bug. It’s a feature of being a conscious creature in an unraveling civilization. I don’t think we’re malfunctioning. We’re noticing. And I think the very fact that it hurts means we’re still human. And I think it means we haven’t quite gone numb yet.

Thomas Merton said, “We are so obsessed with doing that we have no time to be.” We’ve fallen into the trap of believing that we are what we do. But you are not your résumé or your follower count. You are not your credit score. You are a sentient sack of meat floating on a spinning rock who somehow has the ability to feel grief and beauty and awe and dread all in the same 90‑second window. I don’t see this as dysfunction. I see it as depth.

But how do we live with that kind of awareness and not drown in it? Well, I think we start by turning down the volume on everything that’s trying to sell us anesthesia. Let’s turn down the news cycle that feeds on our cortisol. Let’s turn down the influencers pretending anxiety can be cured with a mushroom latte and 5 a.m. lunges. Or, how about we silence the productivity cult that acts like burnout is a spiritual achievement.

bell hooks said that choosing love in a loveless culture is a radical act. Choosing stillness is too. Choosing not to scroll past your own discomfort but to sit with it and learn its name. And maybe most importantly, choosing each other. Because the myth of the individualist savior—it’s just that, a myth. Nobody survives collapse in solitude. And I think whether we like it or not, we’re going to need each other. Even if we’re all weird and traumatized and awkward as hell at hugging and divided.

Ivan Illich once wrote about the idea of conviviality: the art of living together without domination. Not in utopia, just in dignity. It’s not sexy, but it is real. And I don’t know, maybe that’s the answer. Not to optimize your way out of collapse or to build a better life on the smoldering ruins of a toxic system, but to just slow down, feel it, and grieve it. Laugh at it. And then imperfectly, humanly connect. Because maybe the crisis we’re all having is less about midlife and more about the middle of something else. Something that’s falling apart, yes, but also maybe something beginning.",6,1753065457.0,rant,5,0.75,False

Was looking to daily the truck, just a little local road commute to work, I see kei trucks around so I assume they can be registered and be given titles in il provided the BoL and other necessary paperwork. One specific reddit post of a reddit or getting their registration revoked has me nervous but I cant find anything online definitively saying they are or are not illegal. Id love to have some homie on here that has a kei truck in il to talk me through just a couple worries of mine. Will send coffee money. Thankyou .",4,1753065432.0,keitruck,2,1.0,False

A smart mug sounded kind of extra, like something I’d use once and forget about. But after actually using it day to day, it surprised me in a few ways.

The idea behind it is simple, it keeps your coffee or tea at the exact temperature you set. You can control it with the app or just use the default settings, and once it’s set, your drink stays warm until the last sip. For someone who gets distracted and lets their coffee go cold all the time, this thing is a game-changer. No need to microwave your cup or toss out lukewarm drinks.

Battery life could be better though. Without the charging coaster, it only lasts around 1.5 hours, maybe two if you keep the temp lower. That’s fine for a quick session at your desk, but not great if you're planning to take it around the house. Also, the Bluetooth connection can be a little buggy sometimes. It doesn’t always connect to the app right away, though it still holds your last-used temperature setting, which helps.

Build quality is solid and the design looks nice, but it’s definitely pricey. That’s probably the biggest drawback, it feels like a luxury item more than a necessity. It won’t change your life, but if you really enjoy hot drinks and hate reheating them, it does what it promises. Curious if others have used it for a while, has it held up for you long term? Any tricks or tips that make it even better to use?",1,1753065404.0,productreview,0,1.0,False
1m57bqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nonsleep/comments/1m57bqy/ive_been_on_186_dates_this_year_none_of_them_have/,I've been on 186 dates this year. None of them have met,"I’ve been on 186 dates in the past year. All with different guys, but none of them have met *me.*

I only go for married guys. It’s easy enough. I write in my bio “I’m better than your wife” and wait for someone to ask me to prove it.

There’s something thrilling about matching with an ugly guy, knowing that the girl I’ve chosen to pose as is way out of his league, and then watching as he acts cocky anyway.

I’ll lay in bed and giggle like a teenage girl while I make him think that his pickup lines are working.

“Knock knock.”

“Who’s there?”

“What when”

“What when who?”

“Date, this week, me and you.”

“OMG that was so cute!”

We’ll set up a date at a bar. I’ll let him feel like he’s picking where we go, but I’ll drop hints to get what I want. If I’m feeling a country bar I’ll say I like places that play Willie Nelson; where I can dance if I feel like it, or people watch if I don’t. They’ll tell me they know a spot, like it’s a speakeasy and not the first place that came up on Google when they searched “country bar.”

I’ll get there 30 minutes or so early, and when he walks in I’ll be sitting there with a drink—an espresso martini if it’s been a long day, or a cosmo if it feels like a party kind of night. The guy will take a seat, usually already buzzed (it takes a lot of courage to go out with a fake-ID-wielding 18-year-old when you’re 45 and your wife’s waiting at home), and I’ll be just a couple of seats away from him.

If I’m feeling especially silly, I’ll text him to buy me a drink, whatever’s most expensive. He’ll shoot me a message asking where I’m at, and for an hour I’ll keep reassuring him that I’m “still getting ready” or “almost there” or “stuck in traffic.”

One time I waited until a guy bought his first drink. Then, I told him I was running a little late, but that he could go buy condoms and I’d be there soon. I waited until he came back and bought another drink to text him:

“Omg, if you’re still at the store, can you buy some lube? See you in 20 minutes!” He left again, came back, and ended up staying at the bar until it closed at 2:00 a.m.

By the time a guy decides to leave, he’ll be shitfaced and raging to the bartender about the stupid bitch who stood him up. I’ll follow him as he walks to his car, wait for him to start it, then stick him with my little needle to put him to sleep. I’ll shove him into the passenger seat, use his face to unlock his phone, and then I’ll look up his address and start driving. I think of it as a favor; he really shouldn’t be driving at this point.

Once in his driveway, I’ll put him in the driver’s seat and wait for him to wake up. If I was able to make an accurate dose (I hate it when guys lie about their height) it won’t take long. But if I’m off by even a millimeter, I’ll have to wait a while. 

He’ll freak out a bit when he wakes up—grab the steering wheel and slam his foot on the brake like he’s about to swerve into traffic. But once he calms down, he’ll figure he just drove home and passed out.

I’ll follow him into the house. Oftentimes his wife will be awake by the time we get into the bedroom. If she isn’t, I’ll gently rub her shoulder or blow on her face to wake her up. As the man walks near the bed, I’ll do something—drop panties on the floor or call him with a super cheesy ringtone that I set up while he was asleep. Anything to make sure he gets caught.

Once his wife is good and mad, either having stormed out of the house or kicked him to the couch, I’ll make him kill himself. It’s easier than you’d think.

If I’m lucky, he lives in a third or fourth floor apartment and has a balcony. I’ll make a sound outside; when he goes to investigate, I’ll push him off.

Sometimes I’m creative. One time, a guy decided to take a bath, so I waited until he fell asleep. Then, I plugged in a coffee maker and threw it in. He screamed and lashed around for a while before going limp.

Other times, while he’s passed out, I’ll pour a whole bottle of vodka down his throat.

Sometimes I hang around to watch the wife’s reaction. You’d be shocked. Sometimes, she screams and cries and calls the police. She bangs on his chest and tries to breathe life back into him. Other times, she’ll shout obscenities at his body, telling him she’s glad that he’s dead.

Most often, it’s a shocked gasp or a cut-off scream. Then, a smile. She’ll take a deep breath, whisper something like, “thank you” and then call the police. She’ll force some sobs on the phone, but she won’t start the real waterworks until the flashing lights are outside. By the time the first cop enters the house, she’ll be snotty and red-faced, a terrified wife who just found the love of her life dead. 

I don’t know what happens after that, but I imagine most of them tell the full story. She found out he was cheating, they got into a fight, and next thing you know she found him dead. 

I assume there’s usually some suspicion, but I doubt these wives ever get charged. There can’t be any evidence. After all, they’re innocent. And the person who did the killing doesn’t exist. Not completely.

But I’m not here to tell you about the 186 guys who didn’t meet me. I’m here to tell you about the one who did.

It was shaping up to be a normal night. I was laying in bed and listening to music as I texted an especially daring one. We hadn’t even moved to Snapchat yet and he was already telling me all the things he wanted to do to me. I usually make the guys wait a few days, get their hopes up, give them a chance to change their minds, but I was bored. It had been three days since my last date, and I didn’t feel like waiting any longer. 

Plus, this guy reminded me of someone. 

He was a little overweight, and he stared at me through my phone screen like he thought I owed him something. His eyes were narrow and his chin was raised high as he looked down at the camera. I couldn't help but laugh as I thought about him walking around his room setting up the perfect angle.

We met up less than three hours after matching.

He sat only two spots away from me, and he didn’t drink any alcohol as he waited for his date to arrive. Instead, he played snake on his phone and drank Diet Coke for over two hours before heading back to his car. 

I decided not to drug him. He hadn’t drunk a lick of alcohol, so it wasn’t like he was going to believe he passed out and miraculously sleep drove his way home. Besides, he was probably the first guy in the history of the world to lie and say he was *shorter* than he actually was. On Tinder he claimed to be 5’9. In person he was at least 6’3 and 50 pounds heavier than I anticipated. I probably packed enough to knock him out for 15 minutes max. 

We pulled into his driveway, and I followed him through the front door. He went to the bathroom as I explored the house.

It was all very sanitary. There were two bedrooms but no sign of anyone else. The beds were made, but there were no pictures on the walls, no books, no toys. The carpet was freshly vacuumed, the counters were without a crumb. There was a bowl of fake fruit on the kitchen table. 

The pantry was bare except for granola bars and a box of Cheerios. The fridge held milk, eggs and butter, but smelled faintly of chemicals.

When I heard the toilet flush I gently closed the fridge. I waited for the sound of the sink, but then he was walking into the kitchen. 

*Of course he didn’t wash his fucking hands.* 

I wasn’t sure if he actually had a wife or not. There was no ring on his finger, but that’s par for the course when someone’s going out to cheat. The master bedroom had enough pillows, but the closet was empty except for khakis and collared shirts. 

I was trying to decide if I should kill him or just leave when the most shocking thing possible happened. 

“You know, you don’t look at all like your pictures.” 

He fucking spoke to me. Had I accidentally woken too soon? But no… I could see through my arms. My veins were absent. My feet were floating just an inch above the ground. 

My breath caught in my throat; my body went cold. For the first time since the accident I was… scared? Excited?

I stayed completely still. He was looking right at me, but of course he couldn’t see me; he wasn’t talking to me. That was impossible.

“You gonna answer me?”

I turned and made to run through the wall, but then something smacked into my back and I fell.

I tried to get up and move, but I was stuck on that kitchen floor like a fly in honey. I pulled and pulled but couldn’t move an inch. 

I laid face down as he poured something on me. It burned like scalding rocks. From the corner of my eye I could see flakes falling to the floor and forming a mound. Specks of salt mixed with something red.

He poured pounds and pounds worth until I thought I was going to melt through the floor. By the time he stopped, I felt not only burned and crushed, but incredibly claustrophobic. I remembered when I was a kid and my brother would push me into the crack between his bed and the wall. There was a sense of doom, and the feeling of being slowly crushed.

The crushing got closer and closer, heavier and heavier, until my skin and muscle and fat were pushing down on my bones and my intestines. Any moment my insides would squish like sponges, only to release torrents of blood as my bones split like twigs. I felt so horrifically human.

I thought I was going to pass on again—somewhere new. But then he grabbed me. Something else that should have been impossible. He pulled me with one hand like I was a child. We went out the back door.

I bit and kicked and screamed, but it was no use. I was weak from the poison, and he was too strong.

He laughed. “Guess there’s still a human in there after all.”

We entered the garage, which was completely empty except for a rectangular glass cage, an office chair, a ladder, and a pantry cabinet.

 He opened the glass door and threw me inside. 

It took a moment for the pain to stop. Then I was the one laughing. *Men are so fucking dumb*. *It’s a wonder they don’t see it tatted on their foreheads when they look in the mirror.* He thought he could just throw *me* in a glass cage and that would be the end of it? 

He took a seat and stared at me like this was some sort of exhibit. 

*We aren’t at the zoo.*

He smirked at me as I walked toward him. The idiot didn’t think to check my pocket. My syringe was practically buzzing, a magnet for my hand that twitched with fury. I was two steps away from him when I smacked into the glass. 

I must’ve looked like a stupid puppy trying to chase a squirrel in the backyard. I tried again, more focused, slower, but I couldn’t get through it. Somehow it was… ghost proof. 

“You ready to talk?” He asked.

“I… I… how?” 

He sat down and laughed. “I have to say, even for me this is fucking amazing. I mean, unbelievable. I’m probably the first person to ever have done this. I captured a real motherfucking ghost.” 

“Wh-what do you want?” How can you… how did you find me? How did you do this?”

He tilted his head to the side and looked up as if imagining something far away. 

“This is all I ever wanted,” he said. “It’s my life’s work… no, my entire bloodline’s work. I saw you for the first time at the bar—months ago. You came back again and again. Each time you followed a different man. It doesn’t take a genius to put it together. You’re a serial killer. You lure men to bars, follow them home, and kill them. You sick fuck. I thought you’d be harder to catch, have a little more spine. I didn’t expect you to be so weak and nervous.”

That’s where I knew him from. He was a bartender at one of the places I frequented. I thought I’d caught him staring at me once, but of course not*.* He was looking at someone behind me, or zoning out. I hadn’t realized he’d been planning my capture. 

He said he’d had this gift since he was young. It freaked his mom out so he was sent to live with his grandma. There she told him about *her* gift, and her research—her books, spells, and rituals. She could sense ghosts, faintly. And with the right materials she could dispel them. She'd spent 30 years working as a pro bono exorcist. She’d invented a mix of salt, crushed glass, and iron fillings that could allow you to trap ghosts in a defined area—like a cage. It also burnt the shit out of them.

She had all kinds of tricks like this. By combining his more advanced powers with his grandma's tricks and spells… he thought he could work to dispel evil spirits all over the world.

“It was more of a hobby,” he said. “Until I realized what you were doing. You didn’t think anyone would notice? A man complains to me about being catfished, then goes home and dies. Then the next day it happens again? You think just because you’re dead you can do anything you want? You think the law doesn’t apply to you? No. I’m the judge, jury, and executioner—and you’re guilty.”

“So what are you gonna do?” I asked. “Kill me?” I needed to buy time. I’d be able to change soon. I just needed a few more minutes.

He laughed. “I wish I knew. I really do. But you’re gonna be the lucky girl who gets to find out.” 

He opened the pantry cabinet, and I saw that it was stocked full with more of those bags. I flinched at the thought of any more of it touching me. He grabbed two of them, and I prayed that he was going to walk forward and open the door. The syringe was burning a hole in my pocket, I had to bite my lip to stop from reaching for it.

Instead of walking toward the door, he slung the bags like a strongman one after the other on top of the cage. They must have weighed at least ten pounds each, and as they landed they burst open slightly. A little bit of the stuff fell through the tiny holes which were drilled all around the ceiling. Small pieces fell on me and burned like ashes from a fire. I screamed out so sharply that I thought the glass would shatter all around me—it didn’t. He threw more and more bags on top of the cage, five, then ten, then I stopped counting.

He leaned a ladder up against the cage and climbed on top of it.

I looked all around. There had to be something I could do, some form of shelter. Even as a ghost, even in what could have been my last moment before I got sent back to *that place*, my psychology was so stupidly human. When it comes down to it we all think of life like a movie or a video game. There’s always a way out, God wouldn’t ever put us in a position where we’re utterly screwed.

And so, I believed that there was a way out, a way to win. I wasn’t going to let him pour that stuff on me again. It simply couldn’t happen.

But I was wrong. He stood on top of the cage and poured bag after bag on top of me. As it fell on me my skin seared and smoke poured from my body. I ran and ran from one wall to the other, then in circles around the cage. It began to fill up the ground and the air all around me. I fell on top of it. My vision went black, but no, I hadn’t passed out. 

My world was an endless void of pain. I was nothing but one big nerve being stabbed with a sword of fire.

I wasn't sure if I was even in the cage. Had I left the word and gone to purgatory? Was that what this was? Was I going to be left forever in this dark, cold, burning place? 

But no, vaguely, I could hear him descending the ladder. As he did so I felt the pain give way to a slight, pleasant heat. It started at my feet and worked its way up my body.

I focused and pushed hard. *Please God, just let me do it one more time.* It was as if I was out on the beach in the middle of a cold night, but now the sun was slowly making its way through the clouds.

I smiled faintly when I realized what had happened. I’d come to. I couldn’t see, but the salt no longer burned. I was laying on sand. I wiggled my fingers as I heard crunching on the ground behind me.

By the time he stood over me I could see, though my vision was blurry. I relaxed my body as he grabbed me by the hair. He flipped me on my back. I stayed completely still as he laughed and poured one more bag on me, directly on my head.

It didn’t hurt anymore, but it took everything I had to not cough or sneeze as the fine powder went down my nose and into my mouth. He picked me up and threw me over his shoulder.

I opened my eyes. We were walking outside of the cage.

I reached slowly toward the pocket of my jeans, but the bumpy walk made accuracy difficult. At one point I slapped him in the shoulder, but I stayed limp and he didn’t react. Eventually, I got a hold of the needle. I slid it gently out.

He must’ve noticed the much-too-controlled way my body was moving. Maybe he noticed that I was breathing.

Just as I unsheathed my weapon he dropped me off his back and ran forward. He turned, and his eyes locked on my syringe.

“What the hell!?” He yelled. We were in the backyard, halfway between the garage and the house. He took a step toward the back door, then hesitated and looked back at me before turning back to the door and breaking out in a full sprint.

The moment of hesitation was all I needed. I dove forward and caught his ankle. He fell and landed on his chin. Before he could do anything else I stabbed my needle just above the back of his knee.

I took my time killing him. After all, he’d almost killed me.

I’m part ghost, part human, and I kill evil men for fun. I’ve been on 187 dates this year, but only one of them has met me. Things have only gotten crazier since my first encounter with a ghost hunter. I’ve learned a lot, and there’s more of them than you might think. 

But that doesn’t matter. I’m going to take them all down.

I feel so much, all the time, and I don’t know what to do with all of it. When I step outside, I’m struck by how beautiful life is. I bike a lot, sit by the river when I can, read, get coffee, people watch. I stay quite healthy, cook lots, eat fine, and am doing fine financially. Basically, I am thriving and active. I’m in grad school studying physics because I sincerely believe that I should dedicate at least part of my life to something that greatly challenges me and my capacities / intellectually. I also studied philosophy in undergrad. 

I live alone and have lived alone since I was 17. I recently adopted two cats, which helps. They’re sweet, quiet, always nearby but the solitude gets heavy. I’ve never had real friends. I had one in high school, but she never really knew me (we didn't really ""speak"" about our actual lives, but rather just stuck together all the time). In university I got close to a few people, but it was always romantic, or on the edge of something romantic, and those relationships aren’t really in my life anymore. And, they were all men. The female friendships in my life have always been extremely lacking.

I’ve had a few kinda female friends but I didn’t really like the dynamic. We didn’t talk about anything meaningful. It was mostly small talk, or gossip, or just commenting on things in passing. I don’t mean to sound pretentious or above it, I just probably just didn't find the right women but always left feeling emptier than before. The conversations never touched anything and always felt like nothing compared to the very strong and intense (intellectual) connections I had with a few men over the years. With them, we could talk for hours, entire nights even, about anything and everything. I miss that kind of connection a lot. I know this sounds misogynistic, and I am deeply sorry. I've realized this is a possibility with quite a bit of shame.

I try to (nervously) fill the space by taking up everything: I draw (recently, on wood) watercolour, pastel, I read, I write when I’m overwhelmed. I’m learning electric bass, I want to start singing. I try to stay open to beauty. I slow down, listen to a real FM radio (which I absolutely love). I am extremely happy like this, in my day-to-day life. There is a lot of beauty to be seen, some beauty to be remembered, and even some beauty to be written down and kept. 

I also really don’t get along with my parents. We’ve had issues for as long as I can remember, and I moved away very far. But I love seeing community, groups of people outside, neighbors running into each other, families at the river. It touches something really intense in me. I want to be part of that kind of closeness. And I want, deeply, to be a mother, and increasingly so.

As the years go by into early adulthood, there is this glaring reminder that I have *choices* to make. I can no longer just be on a boat guided by my parents and schoolmates. Now, all choices are mine and only mine. And those choices have consequences. And, among those choices are the nuances of how I choose to lead my life and relationships.

I’ve spent a lot of time wondering what’s wrong with me socially. I *know* I’m kind and genuine, I care deeply, and I’m conventionally attractive. But I’ve always made myself smaller. I have bad posture from years of slouching on purpose. I think I’ve been scared / ashamed of being too much, taking up too much space, being too intense. And I noticed that I didn’t look anyone in the eyes (don't even try asking me the eye color of something close in my life - I literally will not know). I didn’t even realize I wasn’t doing it until I started paying attention, and over the past two years I’ve made an effort to change that. I practice looking people in the eyes, smiling, staying open. But even then… it feels like too much. Like I’m overexposing myself and it gets too intimate and I feel too intense for them.

I can keep myself entertained, inspired, and stable. But sometimes I wonder if I’ve built such a strong inner world that I’ve accidentally locked myself inside it. I am legitimately scared of what comes next, as I want to build and love something real.",2,1753065277.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1m57afh,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1m57afh/review_park_hyatt_shenzhen/,Review: Park Hyatt Shenzhen,"Stayed there for 1 night over the last weekend. Booked the Deluxe King Bed room via Amex FHR.

For a hotel that goes for \~500 USD per night, this hotel is shockingly average. It's my first time staying in a Park Hyatt (or a Hyatt property, I think) as I simply do not believe in hotel memberships. I choose a hotel based on what I like in terms of location, design, not its affiliations. In this scenario, it just happens to be a Park Hyatt.

First off, service. The porter, upon hearing that I didn't have any luggage in the trunk of our cab, promptly ignored the big bag I was carrying and just told me to go up to the 32nd floor to check in. No one was waiting for me on that floor, and I had to find my way to the reception. The front desk staff who did our check-in was polite, but that's as far as hospitality went. We were given the corner room that we requested, which was nice. No pre-arrival checklist/survey was received before our stay, which was probably the reason that when we checked in, the welcome fruit/gifts were not in our room. They were only delivered after lunch, when we were about to rest.

The room was quite nice and had great views, and I liked the neo-Chinese design (or whatever this is called). I didn't understand why they placed two wardrobes that didn't stretch all the way to the ceiling and only occupied 2/3 of the wall instead of a floor-to-ceiling one that offers more storage. I imagine if I stayed here for longer I would have a hard time with storage.

The part I hate the most about this hotel, or luxury hotels in general in China, is that they somehow all decided that they were too upscale for delivery robots, which was almost a given a standard 5-star hotels and goes all the way to 3-star ones, and delivering the food to guest rooms was somehow beneath them. The compromise they've collectively chosen is for you to get your ass down there and pick them up yourself. In the case of Park Hyatt Shenzhen, it's particularly frustrating because you had to change to another lift on the 32nd floor to get down. The digital lockers reserved for food deliveries were also too small for the number of guests, so more often than not, your food will be left on the ground. It's amusing how the hotel cited ""food hygiene reasons"" for not bringing your food up to your room, but the option they chose was infinitely worse from a guest experience perspective.

Breakfast was passable at best, and they clearly had a capacity issue. We had to wait for a couple of minutes before being allowed in. The whole buffet was like a morning market, chaotic and not very appetizing. The food from room service, however, was spectacular. All 3 dishes were super delicious and reasonably priced. However, I did not like that I couldn't find the menus for all of their restaurants on their website. I was interested in doing an afternoon tea but gave up after I couldn't find the menu anywhere.

Tried out the hotel's gym due to being stuck by Typhoon Wipha. It was small but well-equipped. But definitely small. Also tried the hotel's lobby bar, The Living Room before leaving after the front desk kindly reminded me that I had unused Amex credits. The iced drip coffee was great and a bargain.

Finally, the hotel seems to have a clientele problem and was infested with stuck-up influencer bros that would size you up and walk with a stick in their ass, and middle-aged uncles with dark color polo shirts and an LV belt. Fits the hotel's vibe, I guess. Overall an incredibly ""mid"" hotel, as the youth would call it.",3,1753065240.0,hyatt,2,1.0,False

1m579f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousConversation/comments/1m579f2/im_almost_22_life_is_too_beautiful_that_it_has/,"I’m almost 22, life is too beautiful that it has turned me outside in.","I don’t even really know where to start. I feel so much, all the time, and I don’t know what to do with all of it. When I step outside, I’m struck by how beautiful life is. I bike a lot, sit by the river when I can, read, get coffee, people watch. I stay quite healthy, cook lots, eat fine, and am doing fine financially. Basically, I am thriving and active. I’m in grad school studying physics because I sincerely believe that I should dedicate at least part of my life to something that greatly challenges me and my capacities / intellectually. I also studied philosophy in undergrad. 

I live alone and have lived alone since I was 17. I recently adopted a cat, which helps. She's sweet, quiet, always nearby but the solitude gets heavy. I’ve never had real friends. I had one in high school, but she never really knew me (we didn't really ""speak"" about our actual lives, but rather just stuck together all the time). In university I got close to a few people, but it was always romantic, or on the edge of something romantic, and those relationships aren’t really in my life anymore. And, they were all men. The female friendships in my life have always been extremely lacking.

I’ve had a few kinda female friends but I didn’t really like the dynamic. We didn’t talk about anything meaningful. It was mostly small talk, or gossip, or just commenting on things in passing. I don’t mean to sound pretentious or above it, I just probably just didn't find the right women but always left feeling emptier than before. The conversations never touched anything and always felt like nothing compared to the very strong and intense intellectual connections I had with a few men over the years. With them, we could talk for hours, entire nights even, about anything and everything. I miss that kind of connection a lot. I know this sounds misogynistic, and I am deeply sorry. I've realized this is a possibility with quite a bit of shame.

I try to (nervously) fill the space by taking up everything: I draw (recently, on wood) watercolour, pastel, I read, I write when I’m overwhelmed. I’m learning electric bass and electric guitar, I want to start singing. I try to stay open to beauty. I slow down, listen to a real FM radio (which I absolutely love). I am extremely happy like this, in my day-to-day life. There is a lot of beauty to be seen, some beauty to be remembered, and even some beauty to be written down and kept. 

I also really don’t get along with my parents. We’ve had issues for as long as I can remember, and I moved away very far. But I love seeing community, groups of people outside, neighbors running into each other, families at the river. It touches something really intense in me. I want to be part of that kind of closeness. And I want, deeply, to be a mother, and increasingly so.

As the years go by into early adulthood, there is this glaring reminder that I have *choices* to make. I can no longer just be on a boat guided by my parents and schoolmates. Now, all choices are mine and only mine. And those choices have consequences. And, among those choices are the nuances of how I choose to lead my life and relationships.

I’ve spent a lot of time wondering what’s wrong with me socially. I *know* I’m kind and genuine, I care deeply, and I’m conventionally attractive. But I’ve always made myself smaller. I  have bad posture from years of slouching on purpose. I think I’ve been scared / ashamed of being too much, taking up too much space, being too intense. And I noticed that  I didn’t look anyone in the eyes (don't even try asking me the eye color of something close in my life - I literally will not know). I didn’t even realize I wasn’t doing it until I started paying attention, and over the past two years I’ve made an effort to change that. I practice looking people in the eyes, smiling, staying open. But even then… it feels like too much. Like I’m overexposing myself and it gets too intimate and I feel too intense for them.

I can keep myself entertained, inspired, and stable. But sometimes I wonder if I’ve built such a strong inner world that I’ve accidentally locked myself inside it. I am legitimately scared of what comes next, as I want to build and love something real.",11,1753065153.0,SeriousConversation,3,0.92,False
1m579bg,https://i.redd.it/7tm5jjyp25ef1.jpeg,Finally cleaned up my setup for the post.,"Equipment:

Agaro 20bar home espresso machine
- okayish experience so far. Water leaks from below if tank is left filled overnight. Milk frother bubbles up the milk rather than frothing. I mostly drink black so, I don’t mind. Any service tips appreciated from users.

Supvox Tamper and distributor
- tamper is okay. Distributor still needs some getting used to and finer coffee.

Wonderchef French Press
- Works good for travel. Filter doesn’t give the cleanest pours, but I can live with it. 

Atomiser
Weigh scale
Milk jug( barely use it for milk, mostly for water )
Containers: Ikea, Starbucks tin, Snack Glass Jars(reuse)

Now this might hurt,

Nutripro Juicer/Mixer for grinding beans
- Mostly used to order ground coffee. Recent surge in usage lead to order beans. Still evaluating basic options of grinders(manual steel burr with full range of fine setting)
- But honestly, the grind is uneven as expected.  If I’m not in a hurry, can get a decent grind. 

Thinking of adding pour over kit from The brewing company. 

🙏🏽 



Coffees I prefer for all black:

Blue tokai
- Silver Oak (Go to, very balanced for me, hits all the notes every time)
- Attikan
- Sandalwood( dark chocolate and orange notes, great tatse)
- Kolliberri( well I’m biased to the dark chocolate, but a good after taste and even better when cold.)

Cothas
- 100% Arabica (medium and even roast, cheaper option, tastes brilliant for the price)

Mokka farms
- Arabica Medium( not too heavy, good for a cold brew. Not too acidic. Not many flavour notes. Just plain good coffee)
- Robusta ( very strong dark roast. Very effective caffine, earthy notes)

Special mention:
draaak coffee( SLN terminus hyd)
Very good coffee, they custom roast to your preference. Tried balanced. Going back again to try others.

1m577iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1m577iy/the_day_he_came_to_the_bookstore/,The day he came to the Bookstore,"“The Bookstore Between Rainstorms”

It always rained on Thursdays.

Mira didn’t mind. The rain was comforting, the way it tapped the windows of the old bookshop like it was asking to come inside. She worked at “Chapters & Tea,” a small bookstore tucked between a bakery and a barbershop on the quiet side of town. The place smelled like old pages, cinnamon, and rain-damp coats.

It was on one of those Thursdays that he first appeared.

He didn’t say much at first. Just walked in with water dripping from his hair and picked up a copy of The Great Gatsby. Mira watched him from behind the counter, wondering what kind of person still read Fitzgerald in 2025.

“Do you need a towel?” she asked finally.

He looked up, surprised, as if noticing her for the first time. “Only if it comes with a warm drink and conversation.”

She laughed. “It comes with a smile and poor lighting. Will that do?”

That was how it started.


He came every Thursday after that. Rain or shine—but it was usually rain. He never said his name, and Mira never asked. She liked the mystery of it.

He’d browse the shelves, read a few pages on the old sofa near the poetry section, and talk to her about books, music, and things that didn’t need names. They’d argue over favorite authors, recommend obscure novels, and sometimes just sit in silence, sipping lukewarm tea from chipped mugs.

There was something old-fashioned in the way they grew close without touching. No social media, no numbers exchanged. Just Thursdays.


One day, he didn’t come.

Then the next week, and the next. The rain still came, but not him.

Mira felt it in her chest like a skipped heartbeat. She didn’t know his name, where he lived, or how to reach him. All she had were the things he left behind: a dog-eared copy of The Little Prince, a folded note used as a bookmark.

She finally opened it.

>“I wasn’t looking for anything when I walked in. But somehow, I found peace.
If I don’t come back, it’s not because I didn’t want to.
It’s because I’m afraid if I stay too long, I’ll forget how to leave.”

Mira read the note three times, then once more just to feel the ache in the words.


It was nearly a month later when she saw him again.

The bell above the door rang softly, and there he was—soaked, breathless, holding a bouquet of second-hand poetry books tied together with twine.

“I got scared,” he said simply.

Mira stepped around the counter.

“You left,” she whispered.

“I came back.”

They stood there for a second, suspended in silence, until Mira smiled—slow, tired, but real.

“You forgot to return The Great Gatsby,” she said.

He grinned. “I was hoping for a fine.”

“You’ll pay in coffee.”

“Deal.”

The rain drummed harder on the windows, but inside, it was warm.

I was 22. He was 32. 
I could tell he was mean. You can see his meanness from a mile away. He walks around so dignified, so self-contained, so aloof. In a word, he's COOL. He's always the coolest guy in the room. 

He listens to bands that only three people in the world have ever heard of. Math rock is his favorite because it's complex enough to keep his enormous brain occupied. He plays bass and is VERY good at it. He knows everything about coffee. You're an idiot for liking dark roast. You know you're drinking charcoal, right?

He doesn't CARE what coffee you drink. He won't try to change your mind. He smugly drinks his whole-bean, light roast, fair-trade coffee that costs $40 for a 12-ounce bag and savors the knowledge that he is better than you in every imaginable way.

He has a mustache. He wears round glasses and skinny jeans. He smokes American Spirits. He collects vinyl. He occasionally brings up his college degree for no good reason. 

He punishes you for daring to speak to him. The first words he said to me, at work, long before we started hanging out, were ""Oh, I don't CARE.""

It's his favorite thing to say. 

I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. 

He loves saying it.

He says it with withering contempt. He abhors stupidity and he sees it everywhere. He thinks most people are stupid and that most things people say are worthless and pointless. A waste of his precious time, a waste of oxygen.

He says it with delight, too, because he relishes doling out punishment. He knows he's making you feel worthless and vapid and vanishingly small, and he loves it because it gives him all the power. 

He doesn't care and you do. It makes him invincible, untouchable. There's nothing you could ever do to get under his skin. His armor is seamless and made of titanium. He doesn't need you. He doesn't need anyone.

He loves to sit back and watch girls fall all over themselves trying to impress him. He loves letting them know that they've failed and will never succeed.

He's neat, tidy, meticulous. 

He knows The Method. 

He Makes the Bed. 

He Folds the Shirt. 

He Packs the Bowl.

He has it DOWN PAT. Everything. Everything. Everything is completely under his control.

 He writes in tiny, perfect cursive. He's brilliant at archery. (Of course he fucking does archery.) At anything that requires precision. 

He told me once that for everyone he knows, he has a bullet loaded in the chamber, ready to go if he ever needs to deploy it. 

The one thing he could say that would hit them as hard as possible, right where it hurts the most. 

He said it doesn't even have to be true. As long as it's hurtful. Excruciatingly hurtful. The kind of hurt that you never get over. The kind of hurt that shatters you.

I thought this was sociopathic. Because it is.

Naturally, I wondered what the hell his bullet for me could be. I couldn't imagine it could be any more hurtful than ""I don't care."" 

My biggest fear was being vapid, boring, devoid of anything worthwhile to say. 

It's all implied in those three words. 

He deployed that bullet and countless others for no reason at all, no reason that I could discern. He killed me again and again and again. 

Often the cruelty was subtle. I couldn't always put my finger on what was wrong. Sometimes it was the way he said it rather than what he said. He was viciously condescending. Smug. Patronizing.

I'd feel the impact reverberate through my body. It fucking hurt like hell. It made me feel sick. In those moments, I didn't want to be alive. I didn't want to exist for another second, trapped inside my worthless body. I disgusted him and I disgusted myself. 
I looked cute. He often told me so. But I was useless. Empty. There was nothing behind my pretty face.


Each time, my head throbbed with the effort of trying to figure out what I did wrong this time. I launched into a complex and exhausting mental gymnastics routine. 
I eventually came to the conclusion that he was right--I was contemptible, cringey, too much, not enough, all wrong, and I should have kept my mouth shut. 

I resolved to think harder before speaking next time. I told myself that what he just did made sense, was deserved, was okay. 

And I withered, shrank, died a little more.

He spoke to me like he couldn't believe how fucking stupid I was. Too stupid to live. He took it upon himself to explain things to me.

He confidently assured me that I knew nothing about things that I actually know a lot about. He told me what and who I was. As if he could see inside me and knew me better than I knew myself.  He was completely wrong and completely confident. If I had ever presumed to know anything whatsoever about HIM, though, or spoken to him like he did to me, he'd be so offended that he'd spontaneously combust. 

""You're not addicted to anything. I am. That's how PERSPECTIVE works.""

""Um, that's how EVERYTHING works.""

""You're really bad at reading people."" (This was his excuse for treating me terribly. His explanation. I was simply reading him wrong. I was perceiving things that weren't there. I was too sensitive. The problem was me.)

His impenetrable armor fell off sometimes. 

When he did shrooms. 

He was naked, squishy, exposed. 

But more terrifying than ever, because he became psychotic every time. There was no reasoning with him, no predicting what he would do or say next. 

My presence clearly agitated him. When he looked at me his eyes were black with hatred. Everything was my fault. I was a criminal mastermind. I was ""trying to break reality.""

I tried to bring him back to reality. 

""Me?"" I asked. 

""Yes, YOU.""

He took his knife out. As if he thought it might be necessary to stab me. 

He was aggressive, attacking me for various incomprehensible reasons. 

It was a conspiracy. I was to blame. For everything. 

Sometimes on shrooms, he seemed to feel guilty. 

He insisted that he had drugged and raped me.


I remember being shocked to learn that he was 5' 11"". 

I'd thought he was about 6' 4"". 

He towered over me. His intellect was staggering, untouchable. He was so much bigger, so much older, so much wiser, so much MORE than me. 

I'm not actually an idiot. 

I'm just as intelligent as he is. I'm also just as MUCH as he is.

If I was an idiot, I still wouldn't deserve to be spoken to like that. 

Nobody deserves to be treated the way he treated me. 

I deserve kindness and respect, because every living creature does. It doesn't have to be earned. 

It wasn't my fault and there was nothing I could have done to make him treat me well.

Friends don't talk down to each other. 

Friends don't punish each other. 

You shouldn't be terrified of the person you love.

Nobody else on earth was there. 

Nobody but the people who are in a relationship knows how it is. How it felt. 

He broke down my trust in myself. He made me question my perceptions, my feelings, my reality. 

It was just me, him, and the cat. 

I know how it felt in my body. 

I know it was real. 

I know that nobody else has ever made me feel like he did. 

I know the problem was him. 

I know that now that it's over. 

He didn't have the balls to tell me it was over. 

He found somebody else to fuck. A mature, open-minded, ""ethically non-monagamous"" woman who was better than me in every way. Who never says the wrong thing. Who doesn't need punishment to keep her in line.

He avoided me for weeks. For more than a year he invited me over every other day. But suddenly he never ever had time to see me.

He invited me over one last time, to use me for drugs and terrible sex.

Then he kicked me out forever and that was it. 

It's been a year and I think of him every day and I can't stop. 

He wasn't my friend. 

He isn't a good person.

He's not better than me in any way. 

He misjudges himself. 

He puts Magnum condoms on his average penis.

He thinks his average intellect is staggering, exceptional, untouchable. 

He's narrow-minded, cold, stiff, boring. 

He is a ""no"" person. He says ""no"" and shuts the scene down. He is where dreams go to die. He gets off on pooping on parties, bursting bubbles, knocking the wind out of sails.

He isn't fun. He isn't funny. 

He enjoys hurting people. He knew what he was doing to me and he did it on purpose. He does not have the capacity to be truly sorry.

The only thing about him that's exceptional is how mean he is. 

He's mean and he's boring.

And I can't get him out of my head and I want to die. I'm a stupid bitch who's obsessed with her worthless ex who isn't even her ex because he wasn't her boyfriend and she was nothing to him. 

Nothing happened. It was nothing.

# What Makes Coffee Beans Organic

Organic coffee beans have gained popularity among health-conscious consumers. Many wonder what makes these beans special compared to regular ones. Organic coffee is grown without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. This ensures a natural and eco-friendly process. [Let’s delve into the factors that define organic coffee.](https://gomehedi.com/best-organic-coffee-beans/)

# Certification Standards

Organic coffee must meet strict certification standards. This guarantees the product’s authenticity. Certifying bodies inspect farms regularly. They ensure compliance with organic farming regulations. Organic coffee must be free from chemical residues. This protects consumers from harmful substances. Farmers must use approved organic methods. This includes natural pest control and soil enrichment.

# Growing Practices

Organic coffee beans are cultivated using sustainable methods. Farmers focus on soil health and biodiversity. They avoid synthetic chemicals, which can harm the environment. Compost and natural fertilizers enrich the soil. This improves bean quality and taste. Shade-grown techniques are often employed. These practices protect wildlife habitats. They also help preserve local ecosystems. Organic farming encourages responsible land management.

# Health Benefits Of Organic Coffee

Organic coffee beans have become popular among health-conscious consumers. Many seek these beans for their potential health benefits. This choice isn’t just about taste. It’s about what’s inside the cup.

Regular coffee can contain chemicals and pesticides. Organic coffee offers a cleaner, healthier option. It provides benefits beyond the typical morning boost.

# Nutritional Advantages

Organic coffee retains more nutrients compared to conventional beans. The soil in which it’s grown is richer. No synthetic fertilizers are used. This results in higher levels of antioxidants in the beans.

Antioxidants help fight free radicals in the body. They support the immune system and reduce inflammation. Drinking organic coffee can contribute to better overall health.

# Reduced Chemical Exposure

Organic coffee reduces your exposure to harmful chemicals. Conventional coffee often uses synthetic pesticides. These can linger on the beans and enter your drink.

Choosing organic means fewer toxins in your cup. This can lead to better health and peace of mind. Organic farming practices focus on sustainability and safety.

These methods protect both the environment and the consumer. Organic coffee is a step towards a healthier lifestyle.

# Environmental Impact

Buying organic coffee beans can reduce environmental harm. These beans grow without harmful pesticides, preserving soil and water. Choosing organic supports sustainable farming practices that protect ecosystems.

When you brew your morning cup of coffee, have you ever considered its environmental impact? Choosing organic coffee beans can make a significant difference. Organic coffee farming isn’t just about avoiding chemicals; it’s about fostering a healthier planet. Let’s dive into how organic coffee impacts the environment and why you might want to make the switch.

# Sustainable Farming Techniques

Organic coffee farming utilizes sustainable practices that protect the land. These techniques involve crop rotation and composting, which naturally enrich the soil. By avoiding synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, organic farmers help maintain soil health and reduce pollution. I remember visiting a small organic coffee farm in Costa Rica. The farmer showed me how they used natural compost to nourish their crops. This not only improved the yield but also preserved the local ecosystem. Have you ever thought about how your coffee choice affects the land it grows on?

# Biodiversity Conservation

Organic coffee farms often support greater biodiversity compared to conventional farms. Shade-grown coffee, a common practice in organic farming, provides habitat for various bird species and other wildlife. This contrasts with sun-grown coffee, which can lead to deforestation and habitat loss. On my trip, I noticed the incredible variety of birds chirping in the coffee trees. The farmer explained that the organic methods allowed these creatures to thrive. Isn’t it fascinating how a simple choice like buying organic can contribute to preserving wildlife habitats? When you choose organic coffee, you support practices that promote environmental health. It’s not just about a better-tasting cup; it’s about making a positive impact on the world around you. So, the next time you shop for coffee, consider how your decision affects the planet.

# Economic Considerations

When considering whether to buy organic coffee beans, economic factors play a crucial role. Many coffee enthusiasts wonder if the extra cost of organic beans is justified. Examining the economic implications can provide clarity and help make an informed choice.

# Cost Comparison

Organic coffee beans generally cost more than conventional ones. This is due to the farming practices involved. Organic farming avoids synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which can be cheaper. Organic certification also adds to the cost. Farmers must meet strict standards, which involves fees and inspections. These factors contribute to higher prices for consumers.

Despite the higher cost, many buyers find value in organic beans. They often offer a richer, more authentic taste. For some, the flavor alone justifies the price difference. Also, knowing that their purchase supports sustainable practices can be rewarding.

# Impact On Farmers

Buying organic coffee beans can positively impact farmers. Organic farming often ensures fairer wages for workers. It encourages sustainable farming methods, which protect the environment. Farmers benefit from healthier soil and less exposure to harmful chemicals.

Organic certification can provide farmers with better market access. This can lead to improved economic stability. Supporting organic coffee means supporting farmers’ livelihoods and their communities. It empowers them to continue sustainable practices.

Choosing organic coffee beans can be more than a personal preference. It’s an economic decision that can affect farmers and the environment positively.

# Taste And Quality

Organic coffee beans often promise a richer, more authentic taste. Many coffee lovers seek out these beans for their unique flavor profiles. The quality of organic coffee is carefully monitored, ensuring a high standard. This level of detail can enhance the overall coffee experience.

Understanding the taste and quality of organic beans can inform your purchasing decision. Dive into the elements of flavor and quality control to discover their benefits.

# Flavor Profile

Organic coffee beans offer diverse and complex flavors. The absence of synthetic chemicals allows the bean’s natural taste to shine. Expect notes of fruit, chocolate, or even floral undertones. Each sip can provide a unique experience.

Organic coffee is often grown in richer soil. This contributes to a more vibrant and robust flavor. The focus is on cultivating beans that truly reflect their environment.

# Quality Control

Quality control is vital for organic coffee beans. Farmers follow strict guidelines to maintain bean integrity. This ensures that each bean meets high standards. Organic certification involves regular inspections and adherence to specific practices.

Monitoring the growth and harvesting processes guarantees a consistent product. The result is coffee that is both pure and flavorful. [Choosing organic beans means selecting a product with careful oversight.](https://gomehedi.com/best-organic-coffee-beans/)

# Consumer Preferences

When it comes to choosing the perfect cup of coffee, consumer preferences are as varied as the beans themselves. As more people become conscious of what they consume, organic coffee beans have sparked curiosity and debate. Are these beans worth the investment, or are they just another trend? Let’s dive into the factors influencing consumer choices.

# Trends In Coffee Consumption

Over the past decade, there’s been a noticeable shift towards organic and specialty coffee. Consumers are increasingly seeking unique flavors and sustainable options. Organic coffee, free from synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, is capturing the interest of those eager to enjoy their morning brew without compromising on health.

The popularity of organic coffee can be seen in the rising sales figures. Coffee shops and retailers are expanding their organic offerings to meet this growing demand. This trend indicates a broader move towards transparency and authenticity in what we consume daily.

# Ethical And Social Influences

Ethical considerations are playing a significant role in shaping coffee preferences. Many consumers are now prioritizing beans that support fair trade practices and ensure fair wages for farmers. This ethical angle adds a deeper level of satisfaction to each cup consumed.

Social media and documentaries have amplified awareness about the origins of coffee. Personal stories from farmers and communities can influence your buying decisions by highlighting the impact of your purchase. Have you considered how your choice of coffee could support sustainable farming practices?

Reflecting on these factors, it’s clear that choosing organic coffee beans is more than just a taste preference. It’s a decision that aligns with values around health, ethics, and sustainability. Are you ready to make your coffee habit more meaningful?

# Making An Informed Choice

Choosing to buy organic coffee beans can be more than just a preference; it’s a conscious decision that impacts various aspects of life. However, making an informed choice requires more than just knowing if the beans are organic. You need to consider your priorities and understand the balance between costs and benefits. Let’s dive into how you can make a thoughtful decision.

# Evaluating Personal Priorities

Think about what matters most to you. Is it the health benefits, environmental impact, or simply the taste? Each factor can influence your choice significantly.

Health enthusiasts often prefer organic beans due to fewer chemical residues. If sustainability is crucial for you, organic farming practices typically support better environmental health.

Consider past experiences. Have you noticed a difference in taste between organic and conventional coffee? Your personal encounters can guide your priorities.

# Balancing Costs And Benefits

Organic coffee often comes with a higher price tag, but what are you getting in return? Weigh the benefits against the costs.

Calculate your budget. If you’re a daily coffee drinker, buying organic may stretch your finances. Is the potential health benefit worth the extra expense?

Consider alternatives. Are there local farmers’ markets where you can find organic coffee at a better price? Sometimes, creative solutions offer the best balance.

Ask yourself this: Does spending more on organic coffee align with your overall lifestyle and values? Your answer will help steer your decision.

Ultimately, making an informed choice about organic coffee beans involves understanding your priorities and being mindful of the costs. Evaluate what’s most important to you and how it fits into your daily life. Only then can you decide if organic coffee beans are worth the investment.

I got clean when I got pregnant with my first. My husband/kids father when 1rst was about 2 months old, with lapses and relapses but none were extremely noticeable except 2 times. I believe he is done now. Both of our moms are/were, my entire family on my mom's side is. (We arent super around them but still)

So, how do I protect and armor my children?? Are there early signs of addictive personalities?? My son goes crazy for sugar. I mean, he will outright refuse to eat anything all day. EVERY SINGLE MORNING, FOR YEARS, he cries over sweets!!!! And its ALWAYS NO. WHY!! (most of the time im calm. But im only human and sometimes i get an attitude about it) The answer never changes! And its a constant near all day thing!! Ive tried to not put sugar on a pedestal (admittedly I did the first 2 years of his life, by accident. So I told him we were going to change how we see it, now im more lenient but I focus on balancing nutrients, with age appropriate explanations and giving him what i know he likes, etc. I also still have clear boundaries that never change but he still sees it as ""i eat this just so I can get sweets"" a lot. He still whines and weeps all throughout the day, and if he can choose stuff that isnt sweets - crackers, biscuits, bread. Things that break down, from what I understand, into certain types of sugar.

I know all kids crave it. But im concerned his is over the top, and im wondering if its connected to some health issues he is having (meaning he craves it so much because his body needs more/doesnt absorb enough in a healthy way). Hoping for answers soon.

But my biggest concern---- addiction. Is this an early sign of an addictive personality??

I know nobody can answer that question for sure. Im just kind of freaking out about it. Im terrified of my children's predisposition to severe addiction. Im clean, but I am addicted to coffee. (I did quit nicotine just over a year ago after using it nonstop from 11 yo to 27 yo!) My husband still does nicotine pouches.

Anyone been in a similar situation?

The City Beneath the Lie
Altitude

The tower did not sway. 

Not up here. 

Not in the breathless hush above cloud and sound, where glass held the sky like a memory and wind curled around steel like a snake remembering its shape.

The CN Tower rose like a spear through heaven’s soft mouth, and Kai stood at its tip. 

Bare feet on reinforced alloy.

QOR (Quantum Organic Resonance) clinging to him like poured starlight-shimmering silver-light, thin as intention, alive with silent frequency.

No helmet. 
No armor. 
No tether. 

Just him. 

Eyes open. 
Breathing. 
Watching.

Toronto sprawled beneath like a wounded animal trying to look whole. 

Glittering. Buzzing. Pretending.

The lake pulsed in the dark, oily and soft. 

QEW curved like ribs. 

Condo lights blinked like false stars.

Below him, millions moved.

Blinking. Buying. Sleeping. Forgetting.

“This is not a battlefield,” he thought. 

“It’s a lullaby.”

He didn’t feel powerful. 

He felt aware. 
Which was worse. 

Because now he saw it: the lattice. 

The lattice of lies.
Not metaphor. 

Design.

Threads of the Dead Flame woven through everything:

• Political banners masked as patriotism

• Ads whispering worth through hunger

• Grocery store signs reading $7.99 for milk while a child picked crackers with trembling hands

• Religious billboards offering shame disguised as salvation

• Body cams flashing on Indigenous faces, while the white man always walked away

He could see it. 

All of it. 

QOR filtered reality into spectrum: blues for illusion, red for control, green for grief, yellow for ancestral memory.

And through that lens, the city wasn’t just a corpse. 

It was a simulation of peace maintained by engineered forgetting.

He recognized it now. 

This wasn’t chaos. 

It was Severance. 

The world below bore the mark of the Scroll-the signature of Tharion D’Sar and the Dark Architect’s design.

“They made forgetting a virtue,” the silence whispered. 

“But you were born to carry memory without breaking.”

The weight pressed against him, not physical, but patterned.

Frequencies meant to blind, not bind. 

Harmonics that taught silence in place of truth.

He could end it. 

With his hands alone, he could lift the Rogers Centre from its foundation and crush Parliament into the roots of Ottawa. 

He could phase into every news station, every altar, every bank vault, and melt it all into glass.

He could burn the Flame’s glyphs off the bones of the world.

But something in him, older than rage, quieter than power, held him still.

“Does it matter,” he asked aloud, voice small in the wind, 

“if I can split the planet in half… when what’s needed is a surgeon?”

“What if the enemy isn’t a beast to slay… but a tumor to extract?”

The wind paused. 
The city blinked. 

Then came the hum.

Low. Warm. Not from outside, but from within.

QOR responded instantly, rippled, tuned, harmonized. 

The frequency.

It wasn’t music. 
It was memory. 

It was Anuket-Ra, speaking without words. 

A single tone, vibrating in Kai’s spine like prayer. 

It spoke in silence, and he heard it as his own voice:

“Do not fight to punish.
Fight to remember.”

“Not everything can be destroyed.

Some things must be revealed.”
He exhaled. 

The weight lifted, but not because it lessened. 

Because it aligned.

He wasn’t here to save the world. He was here to wake it up. 

One thread at a time.

“They don’t even know they’ve been severed,” 

he whispered. 

“But I do.”

And that was enough.

From the base of the Tower, a tremor of light coiled upward, a thread of golden resonance visible only to him. 

It shimmered like heat, then bent. 

A doorway. 

A Trial Gate. 
The first.

Kai turned his head toward the city one last time. 

The people. 
The grief. 

The hum of buses, of dreams, of broken lungs and whispered songs. 

He let it all enter him. 

Held it like a prayer he hadn’t yet decided how to answer.

And then, he stepped off the tower. 

Not falling. 

Phasing.

Into the next beginning.


•••••




 The First Trial Gate


The light bent. 

Not like glass. 

Not like mirrors. 

It bent like memory. 

Like grief curving toward healing. Like a name someone almost remembers.

From the edge of the CN Tower’s steel crown, a strand of golden resonance uncoiled, shimmering, vertical, alive. 

It hovered in the air like a thread spun by something ancient, something watching. 

And Kai stepped into it.

He did not fall. 
He phased.

QOR folded around him in total silence. 

The city behind him blurred into streaks of light and archive-static, until nothing remained but brightness and breath.

⊚ [Tone: deep gold, warm under the ribs]

“Time is not a line. 
It is a spiral. 
You enter it as memory, not traveler.”

The Trial Gate did not feel like travel. 

It felt like reassembly.

Kai’s atoms shimmered. His heartbeat slowed, not from stillness, but from realignment.

He felt like a tuning fork being brought to pitch, a flute being blown by God’s own lips.

Around him: blackness, lit from within. 

The space between the Gate and the Trial was a suspension of truth, a place where Severance had no hold. 

Here, the Scroll could not lie.

Here, the Architect could not erase. 

Here, only the original frequency remained.

Kai floated, clothed in QOR, arms open, eyes closed. 

And in the silence, he heard them.

The ancestors. 

Not as voices. 

As vibration.

They did not instruct. 
They remembered.

⊚ [A tone: low, thunderous, loving]

“First you will bleed what is not yours.

Then you will carry only what you are.”

The Gate released him. 

There was no impact. 

One moment: suspended in time. 

The next: standing barefoot in a salt flat, under a sun that pulsed like a dying eye.

The sky was violent blue. 

The land, flat and burning. 

There was no sound but wind, and even that felt like a whisper trying not to cry.

Kai looked down. 

No city. 
No wires.

 No Flame tech. 

Just salt. 

Cracked. 
Bleached. 

Infinitely wide.

And at the center, miles away, a black spire, sharp as a needle, rising from the horizon like a splinter from the earth’s forgotten body.

That was the Trial. 

He knew without being told.

“This is not combat,” 

he whispered.

“This is extraction.”

His breath felt heavy. 

His skin hummed. 

QOR shimmered at the collar, then stilled.

⊚ [Tone: glacial, tight, surgical]

“You carry echoes of chains you never forged.

You bleed curses cast by tongues not your own.”

“To heal the world, Kai… you must first cut out what was planted in you.”

He took his first step. 

And the ground answered.

⟡

The Trial is not a fight. 

It is a diagnosis.

As Kai walks, figures rise from the salt, mirage-like, almost beautiful. 

Not enemies. 

Architected echoes.

• A teacher who said his name sounded too foreign for broadcast. 

• A white boy in seventh grade who grabbed his wrist and called him light-skin lucky. 

• A girlfriend who once told him,
 
“I just don’t see race,” 

before asking if he’d ever dated white. 

• A university friend who posted #BLM but never looked him in the eyes when he spoke.

They do not attack. 

They do not explain. 

They simply stand. 

Like data clusters from the Scroll of Severance, coded traumas curated by the Flame to enforce forgetfulness.

“I do not forgive you,” 

Kai whispers to one.

“I do not owe you that.”

The figure smiles. 

Fades.

Another appears, this time, his mother’s face. 

Tired. 
Brave. 

Betrayed by men and still glowing.

“You taught me to carry it all,” 

Kai says.

“Now I must decide what’s still mine.”

QOR glows faintly around his chest. 

Salt cracks. 

And something beneath the land screams.

⟡

Halfway to the spire, the sun begins to bleed. It pours down red light, not heat, but archived pain.

From the cracked flats, roots push up, black and wet, crawling like nerves. 

They wrap around his legs. 

His chest. 
His spine.

He tries to move, but they pulse with implanted emotion. 

Shame. 
Not his. 

Inherited. 
Systemic. 

Designed.

Kai gasps. 
Falls to one knee.

The salt beneath him boils, releasing flashes of: 

• His great-great-grandfather whipped into silence on Jamaican soil 

• A chain gang in Alabama whose songs he sometimes hums without knowing why

• A child in Congo praying to be born white 

• A lab in Belgium, bones measured, futures erased

He screams-but the sound is not rage. 

It’s release.

QOR begins to shift, pulsing white-hot along his ribs. 

The roots writhe.

“I did not consent to carry this.”

“I did not ask to be your silence.”

“You do not get to live inside my name.”

He slams his palm to the salt.

Light pours through the cracks.

The roots catch fire. 

The mirages collapse.

And the spire pulses ahead, alive, waiting.


○○○○○



The Spire and the Cut 


It did not look like a temple. 

It looked like a wound. 

The spire rose from the salt flats like the world had been stabbed and never healed. 

Its surface was obsidian, not stone, not metal, but something in between. 

It absorbed light. 
Refused reflection. 

It was smooth where it should’ve been carved. 

Silent where it should’ve sung.

Kai stood before it, windless now. 

The air had gone still, the kind of stillness that comes before memory breaks open.

⊚ [Tone: tremor, low E note, like a bow on an ancient string]

“Go in naked.”

QOR shimmered once, then peeled away, folding into itself, dispersing as photons.

Kai stood bare. 
Not vulnerable. 

True.

Salt crusted his feet. 

Scars old and new marked his back, thighs, collarbone. 

His cock hung heavy in the heat, unhidden, unshamed, cut like oath, dark against the sun-bleached ground.

He stepped forward.

The spire opened.

Inside, it was hollow. 

No stairs. No altar. No flames.

Just space, dark and round, womb-like and echoing.

And at its center: 
A mirror.

But not of glass. 
Of light. 

A vertical plane, softly glowing, like water stilled mid-fall. 

It pulsed in rhythm with his heart.

⊚ [Tone: harmonic, charged, intimate]

“This is not your reflection.
This is your fracture.”

He stepped closer. 

The image came into focus. 

And Kai saw himself, but not just now. 

Not just this body.

He saw: 

• A boy gripping a backpack tighter when police cars passed

• A teen flexing in the mirror, trying to look ""less soft"" 

• A young man biting his tongue in white rooms so he wouldn't be “too much” 

• A face staring at Jaxx’s lips, afraid to kiss because love might collapse the myth of control
He saw all the masks. 

All the armor he called personality. 

All the trauma he called

 ""ambition.""

And then, Jaxx.

Not in the mirror. 

In him. 

Not memory. 
Resonance.

“He felt the tether.

Faint.

Jaxx’s heart, somewhere far, still beating in rhythm with his own.”

Jaxx’s hand against his ribs.

Jaxx’s voice in the dark. 

Jaxx’s kiss after blood and fire and choosing each other again and again.

It wasn’t romantic. 

It was truth.

“You are not what they made of you.”

“You are not even what you survived.”

“You are what you choose; now.”

The light split. 

A blade formed in the air before him. 

Simple. 
White. 

Humming with memory.

He did not question. 
He took it.
And without ceremony, without cry, without plea; 

“He cut himself open.”

(beat)

There was no scream. 
Just silence, sharp and real. 

Across the chest. 

From shoulder to sternum.

There was no blood. 

Only light. 
Golden. 
Vast. 

Screaming.

It poured from him like a song finally sung.

The mirror shattered. 

The echo collapsed. 

The fracture closed.

And something inside him, something ancient, wounded, waiting-sighed.

This was not self-harm. 

This was counter-ritual. 

The reverse of the Severance ceremony.

“You will not program me.”

“You will not code my grief.”

“I am not your engineered wound.”

QOR returned. 

It did not fall on him like armor. 

It rose from the salt, from the roots, from the breath he’d just taken. 

It poured around him like memory returning to the body.

And the frequency sang:

⊚ [Tone: ascending fifth, open-throat grief turned clarity]

“You are ready to be seen.”

Outside, the world waited. 

But Kai had changed. 
He did not glow. 

He shone.

And the war ahead, was no longer too large. 

Because he had cut away the lie.

And what remained could finally begin to live.


○○○○●


The First Return


The light collapsed inward. 

Not like a star. 

Like a breath pulled back into the chest after a long scream.

Kai exhaled. 

And when his eyes opened, he was standing on the EdgeWalk platform of the CN Tower.

Naked. Alive. 
Changed.

QOR pulsed once and reassembled-rising from the air like mist reversing its own fall. 

It wrapped around him smoothly, fluidly, humming at the collarbone like a satisfied prayer.

Not armor. 

Remembrance.

He looked out over Toronto. 

The skyline hadn’t shifted. 
The streets still crawled. 

The ads still blinked.

But the vibration had changed.

He felt it. 
A ripple. 
A hum. 

A faultline in the Severance lattice, fractured by his return.

Someone just forgave their father without knowing why. 

A man stepped away from the edge of a bridge. 

A girl reached out and took her own hand, and held it like a promise.

No one would connect it to him. No one needed to.

The Archive did not demand recognition. 

Only resonance.

Down below, in a parking garage beneath Union Station, a man leaned against his car and cried.

In the Annex, a woman paused mid-prayer and said aloud, 

“He’s here.”

And on the other side of the city, curled in a blanket, Jaxx woke suddenly. 

Hard. 
Breathing fast. 
Sweating.

His hand moved beneath the sheet without thinking, resting low, where the tension was worst. 

Not desire. Not fear. Memory.

“Kai…” he whispered.

He didn’t know why he said it.
Didn’t know how he knew. 

But something had happened.
And it was beautiful. 

And dangerous. 
And pulling him forward.

Back atop the Tower, Kai stood still.

⊚ [Tone: stillness, one harmonic bell]

“Trial One complete. 
Internal cleansing verified.” 

“Your light no longer leaks pain.”

“You may now wield resonance with full force.”

“Next portal awaits.”

Kai didn’t move. 
Not yet.

He turned his face to the wind.

Felt the city exhale.
And in that breath, he felt a question still echoing. 

One he had not asked aloud.

“Can I win?”

And in return, from nowhere and everywhere:

“You already did.”


◇◇◇◇◇



Temple of Severance: Tharion Reacts.


Beneath the Parliament vaults, the Circle stirred. The walls did not shudder. But the glyphs, blinked.

Twelve masks turned as one.

Sister Vein gasped, though her mouth remained sewn.

The Mirror Array pulsed-once. Then fractured.

Tharion D’Sar opened his eyes.

The chamber darkened.

“The Archive has breached a gate,” 

whispered one Elder.

“No,” 

Tharion said, rising from the Bone Throne, voice razor-smooth. 

“A gate has remembered itself.”

Behind him, the wall flared. 

A glyph-once inert-began to glow gold.

He stared at it, unmoving.

“He’s begun.”

His hand trembled once. 
Then stilled.

“Prepare the next vessel.” 

“And double the Chains.”

“The Line Between Us”

Location: Kai’s bedroom, late night. Jaxx is in his dorm.

They're connected through the Archive bond, a living, private frequency that hums just beneath the skin, pulsing like a shared heartbeat.


The house was still.

A kind of stillness that only deep night knew-like the world had gone quiet to make space for something sacred.

Kai lay on his back, one arm behind his head, the other resting on his stomach. 

The Resønance chip embedded in the walls glowed faintly, pulsing with breath-like rhythm.

Not artificial. 

Alive. 

A silent witness.

Jaxx’s voice came soft and real through the tether. 

Not a call. 

Not a video. 

Just… the bond.

“You good?”

It was lazy and low. 

The kind of voice that didn’t need an answer right away.

Kai smiled. 

But the question he needed to ask had nothing to do with being good.

“Jaxx… you sure this is what you want?”

A pause. 

A flicker in the current.

“What?” 

Jaxx’s voice was lighter now.

 “You kidding, bro? 

The sex is fire. 

I mean, look-between the thigh trembles, the heart-pounders, and this beautiful ass glyph-ring you put around my cock-hello-I’m literally in sacred lockdown here.”

“Like for real, they’d have to cut my dick off to stop me from coming for you.”

“And even then? 

They’d get two inches close to me and I’d pop their heads like grapes.”

Kai snorted out a laugh, covering his face with one hand. 

The bond between them hummed with heat, humor, and that strange kind of realness that came only after a huge bridge had been build across a vast separated space and the sensation of something divine already been sealed.

“You’re such a menace,” Kai murmured.

“Nah,” 

Jaxx replied, suddenly quieter. 

“I’m just… yours.”

The bond tightened. 

Not like a grip. 

Like a heartbeat folding in.

“Sometimes I remember things,”

Jaxx continued. 

“Like-not dreams. 

Not full pictures. 

But the ache in Haakon’s chest?
 
That shit’s real. 

The fire, the way he kept fighting even when he was broken-
I feel that. 

Like something passed down, stuck under my ribs.”

Kai turned onto his side now.

Heart slower. 
Eyes soft.

“You think that’s real?” he whispered. 

“You and me… echoes from back then?”

Jaxx’s voice was steady.

“We’re one half of the same flame, 
Kai.”

“Don’t question it again. 
Not ever.”

“You feel lonely, lost, confused-reach. 

Just hit the frequency. 
I’ll answer. 

I’ll shake your knees and make your cock ache.”

He laughed. 

That Jaxx laugh-filthy and golden, all at once.

“You really have changed,” 
Kai said.

“Nah,” 
Jaxx replied. 

“You just let me be what I already was.”

There was silence. 

Not heavy. 
Just full.

Then Jaxx again-

“We should use this line more.
 Like this. 

Just you and me. 

No noise. 
No city. 
No apps. 

Just this.”

“Tethers me. 
Feels like I’m home.”

Kai’s throat caught.

He didn’t say anything. 

Just let it all soak in.

Then-“Kai…” 

Jaxx’s voice dipped, almost teasing. 

“You wanna cum?”

Kai closed his eyes. 

His cock stirred under the covers, responding before thought could catch up. 

The bond surged.

“You’re already hard,” 
he whispered.

“So are you.” 
Jaxx grinned
across space. 

“I can feel it.”

Kai let out a slow breath. 

His cock swelled, thick with the bond, heavy with want.

He smiled.

“Always.”

The moment Kai said it, the bond shifted.

Not like a phone line.

Not even like telepathy.

It breathed.

Like it had waited centuries for that word to be spoken.

Like Always was a prayer and the Archive itself hummed in response.

Somewhere in his dorm, Jaxx lay on his back, one hand already down the waistband of his shorts. 

The glyph-ring The Archive had gifted during their bond-etched with symbols older than words-tightened around the base of his cock with reverent precision.

“You feel that?” 

Jaxx asked, voice ragged.

Kai arched slightly in bed, eyes fluttering shut. 

He didn’t touch himself yet. 

He didn’t need to. 

The frequency of Jaxx’s arousal was already a flame in his pelvis, sparking up through his core.

“Yes,” 
Kai whispered.

The bond pulsed.

Jaxx grinned through a breath.

“Good.
Now stay still. 
Let me show you something…”

He wrapped his fingers around his shaft-already thick, already throbbing-and stroked slow. 

The glyph-ring glowed faintly, responding to each pass, sending surges of sacred pressure through the bond like ripples on water.

Kai gasped.

His cock jolted against the sheets, untouched, but desperate.

“Jaxx…”

“Shhh,” Jaxx murmured. 

“Don’t talk. 

Just feel me.”

Kai’s hands clenched into the blanket.

He felt every stroke Jaxx gave himself-inside his own body.

Not mimicry. 
Transmission.

Pleasure across planes.

Each motion built into a rhythm, and with it came the memories-Haakon’s desperate touch in the dark.

The ache of dying without his other half.

The need that had lasted across centuries, burning.

Jaxx’s breath hitched.

“You’re… fucking perfect,” 
he whispered. 

“So beautiful when you let go.”

Kai’s head tilted back. 

His hips shifted, then bucked once, just from the force of it.

His cock was leaking now-beading at the tip without even a touch-just Jaxx, just the bond, just them.

“I want you inside me,” 
Kai breathed, voice breaking.

“We already are,” 

Jaxx replied, voice a whispering roar.

And it was true.

There was no distance.

No separation.

Jaxx thrust into his own grip, and Kai felt it inside his own body-
deep, like muscle memory
sharp, like belonging.

Like Haakon had waited 1,200 years to push into Bjorn again and stay.

Jaxx’s pace quickened.

“I’m close-fuck-I’m so close, Kai-don’t hold back-”

But Kai already was.

His body bowed, cock twitching, seed loading like lightning just behind the base.

Then-
The glyph-rings flared at the same time.

One on Jaxx’s cock.
One on Kai’s cock.

Twin sigils. 
Twin flames.

And they came.

Kai cried out, his seed spilling in hot, gorgeous pulses onto his stomach as his cock kicked like it was claiming the universe.

Jaxx groaned, thick ribbons of cum painting his chest and abs as his fingers tightened, holding himself through the storm.

The orgasm wasn’t seconds.

It was eternity, folded into breath.

And when it ended, they lay there-two bodies in different rooms, one frequency, one silence.

The kind of silence that followed sacred fire.

Then Jaxx’s voice, low and smiling-

“Damn, baby… that was just… damn.”

Kai laughed through his breath.

“I love you,” 

he said before he could stop himself.

Pause.

Then Jaxx, soft:

“I know.”

“And I love you back.”

“Tether me anytime, Kai. 
I’m yours.”

Three Blessings and a Curse

Scene: Run to Flame

They were on opposite ends of campus.

Jaxx had just left the gym, hair still damp, thighs twitching from a heavy leg day. 

The dusk light hit his skin in patches through the trees. 

Tank top clinging. 

Backpack slung over one shoulder.

Kai was underground, sorting manuscripts in the special collections room beneath the east wing of the library. 

The air there was dry and humming. 

He wore gloves, sleeves rolled up. 

No one else around.

They weren’t thinking about each other. 

Not in that moment.

And then, the bond flared.

Not a slow ignition. 
Not a tease. 

A surge.

Jaxx stumbled against the wall beside the athletics office, breath punched out of him. 

His cock throbbed suddenly, violently, hard as metal, blood rushing south so fast it made his ears ring.

JAXX (muttering): 

""What the hell…""

He looked down. 

The glyph-ring at his base was glowing, hidden beneath compression shorts and joggers, but undeniable. 

He felt it spinning. 

Tightening. 

Singing.

On the other side of campus, Kai gasped.

The ancient papyrus in his hands slipped, barely caught in time.

He gripped the edge of the table, chest heaving.

KAI: 

""Jaxx.""

His cock surged forward, thickening fast, pressing against denim like it was trying to escape. 

The glyph-band pulsed. 

He could feel Jaxx’s heat like a fist in his own gut.

Something had triggered.

Something in both of them.

They moved at the same time.

Jaxx dropped his bag mid-step, took off across the quad.

Kai abandoned the archive room, sprinting past confused undergrads. 

One woman blinked, dazed, her coffee suddenly forgotten. 

Her heart beat faster without knowing why.

They didn’t stop.

They couldn’t.

The ache grew with every step.

Their bodies fought against fabric.

Jaxx’s cock slapped against his thigh, bound only by the pressure of two layers. 

It wasn’t enough. 

The ring spun faster.

Kai took the stairs four at a time.

The glyph in his ring burned so bright it flickered through his jeans.

His zipper strained. 

He didn’t care.

This was summoning. 

This was need. 

This was fire called home.

They turned corners. 

Crossed through construction paths. 

Climbed fences.

Twice, people called their names. 

They didn’t stop.

By the time they reached the service alley behind the electrical building, they were soaked with sweat. 

Panting.
Hard.

They saw each other.

Jaxx was already pulling at his joggers.

Kai was palming himself through jeans so tight they looked painted on.

Neither spoke.

They collided like stars.

Mouths crashing. 
Teeth clacking. 

Tongues sliding. 

Hands everywhere, under fabric, into hair, around backs.

Kai shoved Jaxx against the brick wall, lips at his throat.

KAI: 

""You’re leaking.""

JAXX (gasping): 

""You’re pulsing. 

I felt it from half a fucking mile away.""

Kai ground into him, jean seams straining as his cock slid against Jaxx’s sweat-slick abdomen. 

The rings-spinning now in harmony-vibrated.

They gripped each other’s asses, pulled closer. 

Cocks pressed together through denim and cotton.

KAI: 

""Fuck, I’m gonna-""

JAXX: 

""Me too-just like that-don’t stop.""

Their foreheads met.

And they came.

Hard.
Together.

Cocks jerking in their clothes, spurting against each other, through layers, hot and messy and soaked. 

Jaxx groaned, body arching. 

Kai bit his lip to keep from shouting.

The rings glowed one final time-then stilled.

They slumped into each other, breathing hard.

KAI: 

""I didn’t even touch you.""

JAXX: 

""Didn’t have to. 
You’re in me, Kai. 
Always have been.""

They stayed there for minutes.

Steam lifting from their clothes.

The alley silent.

KAI (grinning, hand on Jaxx's ass): 

""You’ve got a filthy mind.""

JAXX (laughing): 

""And you love it.""


Their cocks were still twitching.

Not hard anymore, not soft either. 

Just heavy. 
Sensitive. 

Bound by glyph and bond and damp cotton.

Kai leaned back against the brick. 

Jaxx bent forward slightly, hands on his knees, laughing like he couldn’t believe what just happened.

JAXX: 

""You ever think we should try not doing that in public?""

KAI: 

""You ever think that would actually work?""

Jaxx straightened. 

Brushed Kai’s curls back gently.

His thumb grazed Kai’s temple.
His breath calmed.

JAXX (softly): 

""You good?""

KAI: 

""Better than good. 
Like I lost ten pounds of noise.""

Jaxx smirked. He felt it too-a clearing, a tuning.

 Like the fog had lifted in his chest.

The rings had gone still, but they lingered. 

Buzzing faintly against their skin, holding that orgasmic signature like an echo. 

Like a promise.

They walked back in silence for a while. 

Past vending machines, under shadowed bridges, between buildings whispering with late-night crickets and the clatter of campus life in retreat.

Kai glanced sideways.

KAI: 

""I should… probably burn these jeans.""

JAXX: 

""You should frame them. 
Hang them over your bed like a war medal.""

Kai snorted.

KAI: 

""You’re a menace.""

JAXX: 

""A historically significant menace.""

They grinned. 

And didn’t talk again until the dorm building rose in front of them.


●○●○●

Kai couldn’t sleep.

He sat on the edge of his bed, wrapped in a towel, the bond still humming faintly along his skin.

In the corner of the room, his archive notebook glowed slightly. 

He reached for it, flipped to a fresh page, and wrote:

It happened again. 

This time with no warning. 
No logic. 
Just pull. 

Like gravity made of memory and need.

We didn’t plan it. 

We couldn’t stop it. 

We came like gods who forgot they had bodies.

He paused. 

Then added:

The glyphs lit mid-orgasm. 
The frequency veil activated for three seconds after.

We are changing. 

Together. 

And I think the Archive has begun to notice.

He set the book down.

And smiled.

Outside, rain whispered against the window.

Inside, the glyph-ring warmed against his skin, as if in agreement.


🛑 The End...for now but their adventure are just beginning.

For more of Kai and Jaxx’s.

1m56zd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1m56zd7/my_experience/,My experience,"So I've rarely been able to share my experience with the church, for many years I didn't talk about it. And I had severe PTSD from everything. I even for a short while tried to remain christian, and organized religion in and of itself would give me flashbacks and panic attacks. 

I was adopted into a Mormon family when I was 2 years old with 2 of my half sisters. And then later when he was 12 my older half brother was adopted by the same family. 

My adopted... Whatever you'd like to call them (they don't deserve to be called parents) were physically, mentally, emotionally abusive. The Female (the Kracken) was Racist and a Narcissist. And there oldest biological son molested me and my sisters (and who knows who else). 

The Kracken would gaslight, manipulate, control, bully, and a lot of things I actually don't remember. Her husband (George) was just a puppet. And a lot of the stuff they did in order to control the narrative... My siblings wouldn't talk about what would happen behind their bedroom doors. 

The first couple years living in the house George would pull our pants down and spank us. Which I really think is disgusting because you can spank a kid without pulling their pants down. And I don't believe you should spank a kid at all. But I felt like this as a kid too and so one day I actually fought him and he stopped. I think he thought that I was actually going to hurt him. Because despite being small I was actually winning that fight. I was like 6-7. They also never hit my brother Zach, he would follow you as you were being dragged into the next room yelling ""I love this show, I love this show"". 

Something to understand about a narcissist. In order to control their environment and perpetuate their abuse they will have people they treat very well. So I have siblings who know absolutely nothing about the abuse happening behind closed doors, as they would get spoiled to the point they would always defend my parents. And because my parents, just like most of the church, are sexist... Those were boys in the household. The other people that would defend my parents are those who are convinced that they deserved the abuse. 

Anyways, when my brother was adopted they hated him because he was very outspoken about how he was being treated. They demonized him and used him as an example of what not to do. He got the worst of it. Because he was also beaten up by the oldest brothers (who were like 6'10 and 6'11) and my brother in law joined in. These are fucking adults beating up a teenager, all the way up until he left at 18. 

Before he left I was almost invisible. No one ever knew where I was, and they didn't care. I was still physically abused here and there. And I was bullied by my siblings. And then they'd wonder why I was never there. Especially during family reunions I'd go downstairs or sit with my grandpa in his mancave (he would ask me all the time if they were treating me right). Unfortunately, I happen to look a lot like my brother Dylan. So when he left I became a target. 

Another thing about a narcissist, they will always have a target for their abuse to get out whatever aggression they want to get out. 

When I was 13 I started struggling with my mental health. And I had thoughts of ending my life. My best friend at the time actually tried. And the kracken and George called her stupid. It was the first time I disagreed with my parents to the point of infuriating rage. But I also learned that I could not talk to them about what was going on. 

My friends were always non-mormons or low practicing mormons. Idk I don't do fake people, and rich Mormon kids because of where I grew up were 🤢🤮. Besides I never went off of church culture on how to treat people. And if they actually read the scriptures they'd have learned how they were hypocrits. As a result though the Kracken would always try to get rid of my friends. 

I noticed the abuse more when I started learning about psychology more when I was 15. I've always wanted to be a therapist, especially for those dealing with severe trauma. I also had a group of friends that pointed things out when I was 17. 

With that group of friends I dyed my hair temporarily purple at the ends. The Kracken had my older biological half sister who graduated from cosmetology school cut it all off. My sister also smacked me, and if she wonders why I hate her so much today. She is one of the fakest people I know, who added to the abuse and become a mindless drone because she sought out validation too much. 

The Kracken proceeded to pull her car over to the side of the road after church and asked if I had a problem liking girls. Which wtf. I dyed my hair to have fun with my friends, I didn't become a satanist (which there's no problem with satanists just not my cup of tea). She told me that I was never to have a relationship with a girl like that ever again. Which I now realize she thought we were a couple. I just changed her name in my contacts because my mother never saw her in person and wouldn't know what she looked like. 

They also found out that I was on a crisis hotline and told me to take my own life, George told me that he'd even help me and get me a gun. That's when I truly disowned them. But it was also my first attempt. 

I planned at that point to join the Navy reserve and go to the University of Utah and get away from my parents. And I was going to leave the church. When the acceptance letter came in the mail I intercepted it, but I didn't plan on getting a scholarship letter. I still planned on going until my younger sister was diagnosed with ankliosine spondylitis. And I was not going to leave her with those monsters. 

I graduated hs with my associates and got accepted into BYU Provo summer semester 2018. People there are like robots with absolutely no personality (I mean except for the one trans kid openly against the church, that I didn't understand why they went there).

2 semesters later I got my mission call to the Nauvoo, Illinois visitors center mission. I was endowed on my grandpa's birthday (he died of cancer when I was 18). The entire time during the endowment I was screaming in my head ""this is a cult, how do I get out of here"". 

In the MTC I had a lot of mental health issues, flashbacks. They forced me to do counseling. They changed the rules so you could contact your family every week, and it would set me off every week. 

When I got to Nauvooo it was a nightmare. You ever get culture shock from your own religion? I had to wear a pioneer dress, and my Trainor almost tried to kill me. I was bullied by everyone including my mission president. 

After 6 months they send you to a proselyting mission for 6 months because the visitors center isn't busy during the winter. 

Arizona missionaries were worse, more robotic. They didn't care about the people they were talking to. All they cared about was numbers. I met people who were baptized and didn't know it... Or people who didn't know they were being baptized and were traumatized by being randomly held under water. 

I came home early because of the pandemic. My parents blamed me said it was my fault. They had me finish my mission as a service missionary. I tried to escape during it, and the kracken manipulated me by telling me that my younger autistic brother (who only I could calm down at the time) was having a hard time with me being gone. When I got home my brother didn't even know I was gone. 

I was removed from the museum I was serving in and they moved me to teaching kids online in Africa. I pretended to do it, they had no way of tracking it. I also did another semester at BYU making a plan to escape. 

My high school best friend, the one who had dyed my hair purple. She came and let me stay with her for a week. And a guy I met online came and picked me up and took me out of state.

I first tried iced coffee, then I had my first alcoholic drink, and then I tried weed. Idk I just felt like trying everything I was told I wasn't supposed to have. 

Anyways that's the gist of it... I left out details believe it or not lol.

This is just a reflection/debrief of sorts, in which I talk about the process I used, things I did or didn’t do, things I wish I had done, or had done differently on the road to passing the General, Airframe, and Powerplant written exams. This advice should I hope be of help to anybody looking to pass their written exams, regardless of whether you went to school or got your 8610-2s. DO NOT lose your 8610s. Scan copies to your computer to be safe. 

I have no experience with part 147 schools, but if you are planning on getting your 8610-2s, please, please, PLEASE stay on top of keeping your logs up to date! I did not do this due to crippling procrastination disorder (lol) and it set me back by a LOT. It does not take much time each day to make sure you are logging your experience, and the amount of work/stress it takes  to undue years of neglected logbooks is borderline impossible. 

Make sure you have an IACRA account. You will need the FTN number they issue you in order to get your 8610s and to check in for your exams. 

Make sure you have a PSI account. This is where you will register for your exams. Each exam is $175. Go to ( https://faa.psiexams.com/faa/login ) you will also need google Authenticator to login. MAKE SURE YOU LOGOUT EVERY TIME YOU ENTER YOUR ACCOUNT, REGARDLESS IF YOU SCHEDULED AN EXAM OR NOT. FAILURE TO DO SO CAM RESULT IN BEING LOCKED OUT OF YOUR ACCOUNT, AND THEY ARE NOT EASY TO GET AHOLD OF TO FIX IT!!!

Make a note on your phone or on paper with your login info for both IACRA and PSI as well as your FTN number. It will save you time and energy. 

What to study:

- The King Schools videos. Great explanations, presented in a way that is easy to remember, and often includes the visual cues necessary to make something you were otherwise stumped on click. Can be bought online, or may be included in your prep course curriculum (my experience with T-black school) should you choose that route. 

 - Prepware or Dauntless practice testing software. May be included in your prep course (was given a laptop with Prepware at the course I took with T-Black) should you chose that route. Prepware: Cheaper of the two at $150. Breaks each of the three exams down into bite size categories to tackle. Generates realistic practice exams. Can make your own custom question sets based off you weak points, or in the case of a written failure, allows you to make question sets based off of the ACS codes relating to your wrong answers, given on your test results. Dauntless: more expensive of the two. No experience personally but word of mouth is that they have more accurate questions as compared to the real exams. If on a budget, Prepware is more than adequate. If you are REALLY on a budget, Prepware has a mobile version for $10 that does not give you the custom options you get with the computer version. I’d personally recommend both, as they mobile version gives you the ability to brush up anywhere, anytime, whereas the computer version gives you a more realistic presentation of the question/answer format, and more advanced options to tailor your study sessions. Take the time to know how the software works. Knowing the ways you can customize it can drastically decrease the amount of time needed to be prepared for the real tests. 

 - The latest 8083 aviation maintenance technician handbooks. Available free PDf downloads on faa.gov or in paperback on Amazon. Not optional, you need these in either digital or paper format. These contain everything the FAA will put on the tests. Every question I missed I was able to find in these.

  - The latest 8080 knowledge testing supplement. Also available free on faa.gov or Amazon. These are the actual figures used on the real exams. Knowing the figures in some cases means knowing the answer without seeing the question. Example would be general section micrometer reading. Figure 48. I don’t need to even see the figure or read the question to know that the answer is .3004”. Figure 47? 1.436” Should you know how to read a micrometer and vernier scale? Absolutely. But there are small tricks like this to save yourself some studying effort and make your exam go quicker. This only works on questions regarding figures that only have one possible way to interpret them.

 - The latest Jeppesen test guides with oral and practical study guides. Most of the questions I got on my exams were word for word compared to these books. available for free download as PDFs if you know where to look, or on Amazon. 

How to study:

- Study buddies: I CAN NOT understate how much of an asset a study partner can be. Not talking about family or friends (although that can be helpful) but someone who actually plans on taking the exams with you. Studying with someone else who plans on testing at the same time promotes a study environment with accountability, friendly competition, moral support,  and diversity of thought. I took my tests at the same time as two of my coworkers, and I can honestly say that a large part of why I was able to stay on task, stay motivated, understand concepts that I was otherwise lost on, and not lose my sanity among other things, was due to them. That prep course was hell week(s). They made it not only possible, but somewhat enjoyable. This is not to say you can’t do it on your own, but you give yourself a huge advantage if you are able to do so. For context, we not only passed each of our exams first try, we were consistently top three in our class. 

Make sure you are hydrating and eating healthy!  Give yourself at least an hour of time to decompress in between study sessions if you are studying all day. Go outside. eat a healthy lunch. Get some light exercise in. Keeping consistent is key, but you can’t do that if you are losing your sanity/will to live. Being stressed out will make for wasted study time, which you don’t want. 

Self studying:
Affordable. Your only cost will be as much as you are willing to spend on materials, and the actual cost of the exams. However I would only pick this option if you are single, without kids, and very disciplined. Otherwise this method of studying can easily drag on for months, and topics you knew will fade as time goes on. You HAVE to block off time to study for at a MINIMUM of three hours a day, uninterrupted. If you are prone to being distracted (guilty as charged) or circumstances do not allow for uninterrupted, consistent study time, this WILL NOT WORK. PERIOD. Libraries, coffee shops, cafes, etc. are great options if you do not have the ability to study at home without getting distracted. I would plan on blocking off a week per exam, scheduling them for the following weekend. If you apply yourself, a week is plenty of time to prep, including extra time for the few topics that may require extra study time. Any longer, and you risk the knowledge from your early studying going stagnant, and being forced to re-learn it. For context, we took our first exam on day THREE of the prep course. That was with NO prior studying. It is entirely dependent on how bad you want it, and how consistent and disciplined you can be to study this way. Sometimes life doesn’t work out for this to be an option, or you are not able to make it work (guilty) and that’s okay. Another option would be to take time off work, and book a hotel or Airbnb close to your testing center. This would be a much better method of self studying for those prone to distractions, because you are completely isolated, and you have a deadline to motivate you to stay on task. Obviously this option is a little more pricey, but you are essentially paying for no distractions, and a decreased time from study to test day. This will also require a lot of willpower and discipline. However, you could feasibly drop your total study time down to 4-5 days given the potential volume of information you would be able to study with each day being a full study day.

1m56v3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m56v3z/the_neighbors_panties_in_my_bed_heres_your_invite/,"The Neighbor's Panties in My Bed? Here's Your Invite to Nightmare Novel_ Halfway through my shower, the doorbell rang.","Chapter 1  
  
Halfway through my shower, the doorbell rang.  
  
I ignored it. It rang again.  
  
I stepped out of the bathroom and opened the door to find a girl standing outside.  
  
""I'm your new neighbor. I left something at your place—mind if I grab it real quick?""  
  
Before I could agree, she rushed straight to my room, pulled out a pair of lace panties from under my fiancé's pillow, and said with a flushed face:  
  
""My water got cut off yesterday, and I was desperate, so I came over to use your shower. Hope you don't mind.""  
  
She left with her underwear, and I slumped back onto my couch in a daze.  
  
After sitting there for what felt like forever, I finally got up—only to feel something weird under the cushions.  
  
I pulled it out and instantly hurled it across the room—it was a goddamn used condom?!  
  
Bile shot up my throat.  
  
I couldn't hold it back anymore. I bolted to the bathroom and threw up until I was seeing stars.  
  
I was so out of it that I didn't even notice when Rhett came home and found me there.  
  
""Wren, babe, what's wrong?""  
  
The concern in his eyes looked genuine enough. He helped me to my feet, his hand steady on my shoulder.  
  
""What happened? Should I take you to the hospital?""  
  
I stared at his face—not a single crack in that perfect mask.  
  
Doubt began creeping into my mind—was I being too paranoid?  
  
A pair of underwear and a used condom didn't necessarily mean anything.  
  
Maybe it was all a misunderstanding.  
  
Maybe I was just being crazy.  
  
My eyes were bloodshot as Rhett helped me onto the couch. I wrapped my hands around the warm water he'd brought me and shook my head.  
  
""I'm fine. Probably just caught a chill last night.""  
  
Rhett and I had been inseparable since we were kids.  
  
I shouldn't be doubting twenty-five years of history between us.  
  
I shouldn't be tearing down the walls of trust we'd built together over some stupid paranoia.  
  
I pulled myself together and gave him a reassuring smile. ""Really, I'm okay. Don't worry about it.""  
  
Our wedding was just around the corner.  
  
Nobody wants their relationship to fall apart right before their big day—including me.  
  
Rhett gently stroked my hair and said, ""Let me make you some vegetable soup.""  
  
I nodded, watching his retreating figure with a warm feeling in my chest.  
  
Right as I was scrolling through TikTok, waiting for the soup, the doorbell rang again.  
  
I stayed put on the couch and heard Rhett call out:  
  
""Wren, can you get that? I'm kinda tied up here.""  
  
I glanced toward the kitchen where he was locked in battle with some hairy crabs.  
  
I laughed and went to open the door, only to find that same neighbor girl standing outside.  
  
She scratched her head sheepishly. ""I didn't cook tonight. Mind if I crash your dinner?""  
  
The apartment across the hall had been empty for two years. Suddenly there's a new neighbor, and I had no clue about it?  
  
What kind of person moves in and immediately shows up asking for free meals?  
  
I was about to tell her no when she looped her arm through mine and held up a cup of bubble tea.  
  
""I brought boba! The more the merrier, right? And don't worry—I'll totally take your trash away when I leave!""  
  
She didn't give me a chance to refuse, practically dragging me back inside.  
  
As the same time, Rhett emerged from the kitchen carrying a bowl of soup, smiling as he asked:  
  
""Who was it?""  
  
When he saw the neighbor girl's face, his expression went stone cold.  
  
She chirped up playfully: ""Hey there, Rhett! I'm here to mooch some food. Your girlfriend invited me—hope that's cool?""  
  
Rhett's gaze shifted to me.  
  
I didn't bother sugarcoating it. ""I never did that.""  
  
I yanked my arm free from the neighbor's grip. Pointing at the bubble tea, I said to Rhett, ""Looks like you've been having a grand time while I was away.""  
  
I'm not the type to suffer in silence.  
  
There's no way Rhett couldn't see this girl had ulterior motives.  
  
Maybe he was waiting for me to give him an out—waiting for me to say, ""Yeah, I totally invited her over for dinner.""  
  
But I didn't want to.  
  
I locked eyes with him, demanding an answer.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Just like when we were kids and someone tried to come between us, Rhett would always say the same thing:  
  
""In this whole wide world, Wren comes first. Of course I'm choosing Wren.""  
  
I looked at Rhett, then at the neighbor girl, whose eyes were suddenly welling up with tears. She slammed the bubble tea down on the table and snapped:  
  
""I seriously didn't mean anything by it! My power and water got cut off yesterday, so I came over to use your shower. I just wanted to thank you guys today—that's why I brought the boba!""  
  
Her tears started streaming down.  
  
""Do you really have to give me the cold shoulder like this?""  
  
I still didn't respond. I kept my eyes locked on Rhett. He rubbed his temples, then walked over to the table, picked up the bubble tea, and handed it back to her.  
  
""My girlfriend doesn't mess around. Letting you in yesterday was my mistake. You should go.""  
  
The neighbor broke down even harder. ""We didn't do anything! Why is she acting like I'm some homewrecker?""  
  
She made it sound like I was the one in the wrong.  
  
But that condom on my couch, and the red hair I'd found—it was the exact same shade as this neighbor girl's.  
  
I had no idea when Rhett, who usually kept strangers at arm's length, had become so generous that he'd let some random person into our home. Into our bathroom, no less.  
  
A guy and a girl alone together. Who knows what could happen?  
  
The neighbor turned her tear-streaked face toward me.  
  
""I was just trying to be nice! You're the one with a dirty mind, so of course everything looks dirty to you! I just moved in—I don't want drama with my neighbors, but you're being way too much!""  
  
By all logic, Rhett had asked her to leave. If she had any shame, she would've walked out. But she kept standing there, putting on a show. For whose benefit?  
  
I looked at her, completely unmoved by her guilt trip.  
  
""Fine. I'm being too much.""  
  
I threw the door wide open.  
  
""Please leave!""  
  
This time, the neighbor couldn't stick around. She stamped her foot and ran out crying. The apartment fell dead silent. Rhett gave me a look that said he was at his wit's end.  
  
""Wren, don't you think you went too far?""  
  
Rhett and I had been inseparable since we were in diapers. When we were seventeen, Rhett bought up every firework in the entire city just to get me to agree to be his girlfriend, confessing his love under that dazzling display of lights.  
  
""Wren, do you want to date me with marriage and growing old together as our endgame?""  
  
I looked at my boy, trembling as he poured his heart out, and threw myself into his arms with tears in my eyes.  
  
Our relationship had been smooth sailing ever since. Everyone envied me for having such a perfect childhood-friend-turned-fiancé.  
  
And now, here he was, taking some random girl's side against me.  
  
""You know how important reputation is to a girl. What you just said could get her labeled as a homewrecker!""  
  
""Wren,"" Rhett walked past me, deliberately bumping my shoulder hard enough to make me stumble back. ""I was just trying to save your face, but that doesn't mean I think you were right.""  
  
With that, He stormed out, leaving me alone with the lingering smell of soup.  
  
Was I wrong?  
  
Had I messed up?  
  
When I was spiraling into self-doubt, my phone buzzed with a friend request notification.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
My heart skipped a beat as I saw videos from an unknown sender.  
  
In the footage, Rhett was sitting on our couch with the neighbor girl, helping her blow out candles on a cake. His voice was sickeningly sweet:  
  
""Happy Valentine's Day, babe.""  
  
They kissed passionately.  
  
They did the most intimate things imaginable in my apartment.  
  
They were going at it in my bathtub, water sloshing everywhere like my heart was being dragged through broken glass, blood seeping from every wound. I watched the neighbor girl laugh brightly, making cute poses with Rhett for the camera.  
  
""Today's me and Rhett's first Valentine's Day together! We're gonna have so many more!""  
  
She asked him with a giggle: ""Will living next door to you cause problems?""  
  
Rhett's face was flushed with alcohol as he pulled her closer.  
  
""Nah. Wren and I go way back—she'd never suspect a thing. If I'm choosing to be with you, I'll protect you.""  
  
The video cut to the present, showing the girl crying while Rhett held and comforted her: ""Wren's just blunt—she cares too much about me. Don't take it personally!""  
  
""I promise I won't touch Wren anymore!""  
  
""I'll save myself for you.""  
  
The girl sobbed in his arms: ""But she saw right through me! I was just standing there, and she already hated me.""  
  
""I wasn't trying to cause trouble—I just wanted to see you, babe.""  
  
""What did I do wrong to deserve this?""  
  
I watched Rhett's face fill with sympathy as he soothed her: ""Don't worry. I'll spend the next few days with you.""  
  
The video ended abruptly.  
  
A message followed: \[Wren, think your wedding's still happening on schedule?\]  
  
My fingers went numb.  
  
The trembling crawled from my fingertips through my entire body until even my teeth were chattering. The love I'd been so proud of, the man I'd trusted completely, had just delivered the truth in the cruelest possible way.  
  
I forced myself to breathe to stay sane. I saved all the evidence and sent it to my best friend:  
  
\[Rhett and I are done.\]  
  
When I was sixteen, I caught my dad cheating with his secretary. When I confronted him through my tears, asking why he'd do this to us, he just threatened me not to tell my mom. He was so sure Mom would fall apart if she knew the truth.  
  
I didn't believe him. I ran to my mother, crying as I told her about Dad's betrayal.  
  
Later, my mom really did jump from our apartment balcony.  
  
I never had a mother again.  
  
That summer, I lost my mom and my dad. I became an outsider, shuffled between relatives who took me in out of obligation.  
  
Rhett was the one who stayed with me through it all.  
  
Rhett was the one who told me with absolute certainty:  
  
""Wren, even if you lose everything else, you'll always have me.""  
  
Now, Rhett—I don't have you anymore either.  
  
I sat like a zombie in the coffee shop, watching my best friend point at the girl in the video and curse: ""This basic bitch isn't even that pretty! How the hell did she catch Rhett's eye? Remember when the actual school beauty was chasing him, and he wouldn't even look at her twice! How did he turn into this?""  
  
My friend got more worked up as she ranted, finally slamming her hand on the table.  
  
""I'm gonna find that bastard!""  
  
""This is such bullshit!""  
  
""That homewrecker basically moved in next door to mess with you—there's no way we're taking this lying down!""

1m56u1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/phillies/comments/1m56u1y/rphillies_original_reporting_the_vibes_in_aaa/,"r/phillies Original Reporting - The Vibes in AAA Lehigh Valley are Immaculate this year, But Why?","Allentown, PA

AAA has been described as the place that “no one wants to be”. Players that have had their cups of coffee want to be back in the majors, and players that have yet to reach their ultimate goal want nothing more than to pass that final hurdle and get the call that they’ve waited their lives for. Especially in the modern era, where callups from AA directly to the major leagues are more common, AAA doesn’t always mean that a player is on the cusp in the way that it used to.

However, you wouldn’t guess that based on the 2025 Lehigh Valley IronPigs. Players and IronPigs employees both described the clubhouse to me as one of the best clubhouses that they’ve ever been a part of. This is palpable when you’re around the team. The manager of Digital Media for the IronPigs, Owen Lapp, was going around the roster and asking who they would trust most and least with their kids. These kinds of games are common to see on social media feeds for teams across the greater sporting landscape. What gets missed is how much ribbing goes on behind the scenes.

Justin Crawford, Cal Stevenson, and Gabriel Rincones Jr. were sitting in the dugout together at around 3:30PM when Lapp got to them on his rounds through the team. He first asked Rincones, who said that it “definitely wasn’t these guys”, which made the rest of the dugout laugh. After giving his answer with the cameras off, Stevenson poked fun at Rincones, given that Stevenson actually has several children. He said that he should’ve been chosen since he keeps his kids safe, happy, and healthy. Soon, the conversation changed into how Infielder Matt Kroon is a good chef, and would cook well for the kids. Stevenson and Rincones asked Crawford about his cooking abilities, which quickly devolved into them being curious if Crawford even knew how to boil water – which to Crawford’s credit, he said he did know how to do. He didn’t seem as confident about macaroni and cheese.

Another time, Rincones was telling a long winded joke to a group of his teammates. The joke went along the lines of someone throwing a brick out of a plane, various animals getting thrown in refrigerators, the animal kingdom having a party, and then a woman crossed a river that was typically infested with crocodiles, but the crocodiles were at the party. Unfortunately for the woman, the brick landed on her. Fortunately for Rincones, the group of players in the dugout thoroughly enjoyed the story.

There were many stories like these, and I got told throughout the afternoon that things aren’t usually like that in the minor leagues, and especially not in AAA. The first place a fan might go to credit the clubhouse culture in Lehigh Valley would likely be catcher Garrett Stubbs. Stubbs was a clubhouse favorite in Philadelphia for the last several seasons, but had to be optioned to AAA to start the 2025 season, since he had an option remaining, and Phillies current backup catcher, Rafael Marchan, did not. The only way to keep both of the players as part of the organization was to send Stubbs to Lehigh Valley.

Stubbs is still compensated very well for a minor league player. He’s earning half of his major league salary this year for the time that he’s in the minor league system. When I asked Stubbs how he works to create a clubhouse culture, it was clear to me how he is incredibly tuned into his teammates. He brought up how he goes about making a playlist. He wants everyone to feel important in the clubhouse and have music that they like. If there’s a new guy on a team for the year, and he likes screamo music, one can bet that Stubbs will include a screamo song in his playlist for the team. Stubbs also mentioned how he has learned over time to pay attention to body language. Some newer players or younger players might be less confident to express their feeling, but Stubbs pays acute attention to the details, like how their head bobs up and down to the music. He’s found that often, he can learn a lot about a player just from these nonverbal cues. 

It doesn’t seem to be a stretch to say that Stubbs has been instrumental in building the clubhouse culture in Lehigh Valley that has been described as key to the team’s success. This success hopefully will parlay into major league success in the future, as young players such as Crawford, Andrew Painter, and Mick Abel are starting to reach the point of putting their minor league days behind them, and hopefully contributing to the Phillies for many years to come.

People struggling with webhook authentication, trying to chain 17 Google Sheets nodes together, or just completely lost on how to structure their workflows.

So here's the deal: I'm offering to help you build or fix your n8n workflows. For free. Yeah, actually free.

Why? Because I'm bored, I like solving workflow puzzles, and honestly, I learn something new every time I help someone figure out their weird edge case. Plus the n8n community has helped me out plenty of times.

What I can help with:

* Workflow architecture (stop making everything one giant workflow, please)
* API integrations that are making you question your sanity
* Performance optimisation
* Error handling
* Migrating from Zapier/Make without wanting to throw your laptop out the window

What I probably can't help with:

* ""Build my entire SaaS for me"" type requests LOL
* Anything that requires me to touch your production data directly
* Workflows involving questionable legality

How this works:

* Comment with what you're trying to build
* I'll let you know if I can help
* We hop on a quick call or do it async
* I help you get unstuck

But wait, you said something about paying?

Yeah, if you want to throw money at me, I won't stop you. If you're a business and this saves you hours of consultant fees, feel free to buy me a coffee or whatever. But it's absolutely not required. I'm doing this either way.

Fair warning: I'm pretty direct about what's a bad idea. If your workflow is trying to do 100 things in one execution, I'm going to tell you to break it up.

1m56t5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/HollandAmerica/comments/1m56t5t/comments_on_july_512_canada_cruise_on_zuiderdam/,Comments on July 5-12 Canada cruise on Zuiderdam.,"Having just completed our first HAL cruise, I thought I would throw out some comments on some things we noticed. First off, we are a family of three (55M, 42F, 11M) and have taken    a similar cruise on Princess as a family in 2019 and an Alaskan cruise on Princess in 2013. 

This is not a full review of the cruise, but rather just some data points for future cruisers to consider. Many may sound negative towards HAL but we didn’t leave the cruise with a negative feeling towards HAL and would definitely consider cruising with them again. 

With that being said, I’ll start out with a positive: 

*The Signature Suite room (8048) was more than expected. Even with three people it wasn’t crowded. There was enough room to move around even when the sofa bed was opened. There was lots of storage and the bathroom was spacious. The HAL Signature Suite beats the Princess Mini-suite by a mile. Ours was below the Lido pool area and we would often hear what we thought was tables being moved but we finally determined it was the service carts rolling. It wasn’t a big deal to us but it could be an annoyance to some. I have seen other people comment elsewhere about the noise on deck 8 from Lido so this is nothing new. 

* Service at Lido Market tables was acceptable but lacking when it came to refills. The first drink would be served and then nothing.  Princess seemed like coffee and water were always being filled. I am guessing they need to staff up in this area. One issue might have been that if you ask of anything that is not served in the Market they will go get it, leaving the area shorthanded. 

* In general, no one was monitoring wash stations. Most people were not washing their hands when entering the dining area, which is pretty gross considering they are touching/using many of the serving utensils. I’ve gotta say, this was a big departure from our Princess cruises (which were pre-COVID), where they had someone posted up at the dining room entry remind people to wash. Granted, we haven’t been in a Princess ship in some time, so maybe they don’t do this anymore either. 

* HAL uses cards instead of medallions for access to rooms, charging, and identification. Doors are not set up for medallions/prox entry, so it would probably be a large expense to change over and perhaps the HAL clientele prefers the card. Medallions are convenient since they can go in the pool. The best would be for the app to contain these functions, but that may be too much to expect. 

* HAL pool was a little small. This was a summer trip, so the kids on the ship pretty much took over the pool. The pool at the back of the ship was basically unusable because it’s located in the smoking area. If you are looking at the ship for swimming, this is probably not the ship for you. 

* My wife found the gluten-free meal options to be marginal at best. We noticed the markings were inconsistent between the buffet signage and the menu available on the app. Occasionally, there would be no GF dessert option available and asking the person manning the station was useless.  We were able to get the maître d’ to help us a couple times. The food servers were definitely not all informed regarding GF and would often have to ask someone else if an item was GF. 

* Regarding the kids club: our son was too old for the younger kids group based on what they would be doing so he joined the older kids. They only met for one hour each night. He enjoyed the video game nights, but not much else. We did see the kids club for the younger kids did not allow the parents to leave the boat which was an option on our 2019 Princess cruise. This may not be the case now, but if someone was expecting or planning on this kids club feature on HAL, it’s not available. 

Once again, this is not intended to as a negative post for HAL. It’s more just one family’s opinion. We would definitely consider taking another HAL cruise especially because of the cabin size. I would be open to answering any questions about our cruise.

As for me, I love this game to pieces. So I choose to replay it for its 12th anniversary. I'm not going to waste anymore time. Let’s get to it.



[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies - Turnabout Countdown](https://preview.redd.it/tqvisqksw4ef1.png?width=2656&format=png&auto=webp&s=04bc4bc41c15231358aa598b68ed96d9abc6a80b)

**Case 1: Turnabout Countdown**

 

Overall, my opinions on this case have changed for the better. I found the mystery to be properly engaging, the actual tutorial aspect of it felt well crafted, and the introduction to all 3 protagonists were done quite well. This game does a Flash Forward beginning, like Fire Emblem: Awakening, to give players a sneak peek at the final portion of the game, making the player become invested in the outcome of the game, as they've only seen a small glimpse of it. From Apollo's new look to the new protagonist, Athena Cykes, all the way to Phoenix's return to the legal world. It's clear on a replay that he's as mature as he was in Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, and that being in court still gives him stress, which is understandable.



Something I do want to mention here is the opinions on the 3D models, and honestly? I think the hatred towards these models is WAY overblown. I get that people prefer the 2D sprites, but throughout playing the game, there was only ever 1 3D model I felt was too off-putting, one that I’ll mention when we get there.

 

Originally, I had this case near the bottom of Good, but I enjoyed it so much that I think I'd put it as my 4th favorite first case, behind The Adventure of the Blossoming Attorney, The Adventure of the Great Departure, and Turnabout Trigger. It's now at the bottom of Great.

 

**Final Score: Great \[A-\]**

 

[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies - The Monstrous Turnabout](https://preview.redd.it/g6ldyootw4ef1.png?width=2664&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8e937300827bd1870e9f186dfc888f50db12968)

**Case 2: The Monstrous Turnabout**

 

The worst part of the case was just the idea that Damian Tenma managed to swallow the key and threw it back up. But outside of that, this case was a blast. I enjoyed all the characters (even Filch was far more fun this time around), INCLUDING the culprit: L'Belle. I found his over the top dramatic self to be extremely hilarious. Also Trucy’s model isn’t as bad as people claim (although I will fully admit there is room to improve).

 

The main problem people cite against this case is ""they reveal the culprit in the opening cutscene"", but to be fair... that only makes the second half far more interesting, because you KNOW it's L'Belle, but how the HECK was Mayor Tenma able to confess then? The mystery of the case is honestly the best part, as it was all coherent (except the swallowing key act), and since the game doesn't bother with the ""who did it?"", all we must worry about is the ""how was it done?"" portion, which the case excels at.

 

Honestly? It's hard choosing between this case, Reunion, and Turnabout, and The Captive Turnabout. All 3 are Great cases, but I'll put this one ahead of those three because not only is the humor fantastic, not only is the mystery fantastic, but I think this case does the best job at introducing the ""game characters"" (those being Athena Cykes, Simon Blackquill, and Bobby Fulbright). All 3 are FANTASTIC in this case, and Apollo Justice is FAR funnier here than he was in AJ: AA, with his chemistry bouncing off with Athena being PHENOMENAL. Also, I got to mention that seeing Phoenix give Apollo Justice advice, like an actual MENTOR would, is fantastic to see. I won't say this case is the best 2nd case, as that honor goes to The Magical Turnabout, but it's the funniest second case for me for SURE.

 

**Final Score: Great \[A-\]**

 

[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies - Turnabout Reclaimed](https://preview.redd.it/kukiy9vuw4ef1.png?width=2669&format=png&auto=webp&s=e53f2efff33084c7f4b411821dac8c3f0db0a174)

**Case DLC: Turnabout Reclaimed**

 

OK, OK, Turnabout Reclaimed enjoyers, I now see why it's Outstanding. In terms of flaws, there's... really none? Every character is good at WORST (DePlume), and at BEST we have people like Marlon Rhimes and Dr. Crab. Overall, it doesn't tie into the main story of Dual Destinies, which was expected. The areas to explore were fun, and I absolutely appreciate the usage of Luminol (even if it was just one time). The trial sections didn't drag, and, like every case in this game, it gives every protagonist a role (even though Apollo gets the short end of the stick, he DOES get to do something genuinely helpful \[being him researching the Hotti Clinic and discovering not just the effects of the Pill, but also the fact that Sasha and Azura have the same heart condition\] which is LEAGUES better than what Athena gets to do in Turnabout Time Traveler).

 

One special thing I want to mention is how well they justify Phoenix taking on an Orca's defense, with him believing in his client, even when his client is quite literally incapable of reassuring him of their innocence.

 

Overall, it jumped from mid Great to low Outstanding. Still lower than every final case (aside the only 2 final cases I don't have in Outstanding), but being an Outstanding case is no small feat.

 

**Final Score: Outstanding \[S-\]**

 

[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies - Turnabout Academy](https://preview.redd.it/msxjxitvw4ef1.png?width=2659&format=png&auto=webp&s=f55f605d8c7a4a9b2942de4efce4ff0ca137a87f)

**Case 3: Turnabout Academy**

 

How. How did this case, a case I already highly regard, manage to rise in my rankings AGAIN. I stand by that this is easily the most fun case in the entire series by a landslide. Not the best, not the most emotional, not the most logically challenging, but the most FUN.

 

Every single character is Great at WORST (Even Klavier Gavin is used quite well with him directly giving us evidence to support us during the trial, something that he is supposed to be doing as the ""nice prosecutor"" but he only does once in AJ: AA. I will fully admit that his 3D model is a crime against humanity). Robin Newman and Hugh O'Conner are both absolutely hilarious, Myriam is not as hilarious but still is quite relatable due to her inability to socialize and her lack of understanding of how to actually make friends, despite knowing she wants in on the friend group, and Juniper's role as a defendant is one of the most unique ones in the series because she's the first defendant in the series who attempts to requests a different lawyer due to her worry about the truth and Hugh, not to forget about the Culprit, Aristotle Means.

 

On a different note, let's talk about the Dark Age of the Law and how The Ends Justify the Means.

 

I thought the Dark Age of the Law bit and the ""Ends Justify The Means"", while silly, is also really scary with people like Myriam Scuttlebutt, in which you can see that if the ""Ends Justify The Means"" approach isn't put to a stop, these people who are, at first, good people, can start spiraling down a REALLY dark path. Because of this, despite how silly the villain can seem, it's genuinely terrifying. I want you to genuinely sit, and digest the idea that in a legal academy, people are being taught that the world is so harsh that they will be unable to survive unless they adapt to the dark times. With how much it's drilled into you in this one case, a case that only takes 2 court days, I want you to think what it would be to hear that for weeks on end. How absolutely crushing the weight and might of a Results Orientated School would be. Everyone has secrets in this case, but showing any weakness is opening a Means for someone else to overcome them and win in the End. As Professor Means states, the idea that the truth is the only thing that matters is an ideal one, but sad and unrealistic. How many people do you think have suffered with the unrealistic expectations put up by the Professors (like Courte asking Robin to make 2 entire half body statues within a single day)? How many people do you think cracked during this?

 

I want all those thoughts applied to Aristotle Means. That's what I see in him as a villain. That's why I consider him to be outstanding. He is highly competent at crafting arguments while also being intimidating due to not just you playing as an 18-year-old while he's a professor (which most people have dealt with a harsh teacher before), but also because of how horrifyingly widespread The Ends Justify the Means has become in the school.

 

As I said, every student in this case has a secret:

 

Juniper is the Snitch

 

Robin is a Girl

 

Hugh is 25 and just learnt that his parents were buying his grades

 

Myriam wants to be in on the friend group

 

I guess I should also touch on Robin Newman.

 

Robin was done well as a representation of trans women \[Yes, she's not trans, but seeing how it's someone who's forced into a ""male"" persona, but she really wants to express her female side, it's kinda obvious it's a representation for trans women. I will admit the writing was harsh with outing her for the mystery, and I ABSOLUTELY appreciate the AJT changing the dialogue to be far less offensive.

 

I could talk about how Hugh is hilarious and how his genuine desire to save Juniper and how his resorting to The Ends Justify the Means is good character writing because it shows both how much he genuinely cares about his friends while ALSO doubling in explaining how much Professor Means' ""guidance"" has corrupted his thinking.

 

Also, Athena's PTSD attack (episode? sorry if that's the wrong word) was done phenomenally.

 

Long TL; DR: This case is the ""fun"" case for me. It rose from Top of Great to the Middle of Outstanding. Yes, against all odds, I have found this case to be so enjoyable that it manages to rival FINALE cases.

 

**Final Score: Outstanding \[S\]**

 

[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies - The Cosmic Turnabout](https://preview.redd.it/xb6gr6yww4ef1.png?width=2657&format=png&auto=webp&s=40ed0508e9fe8930d2bbeafe001ff21312e8e428)

**Case 4: The Cosmic Turnabout**

 

I went into this case with a goal. I wanted to see if, somewhere in the tucked away dialogue was their dialogue for Clay Terran or hints towards The Phantom's identity. and I was pleasantly surprised that I found more than just what you'd see on a ""normal"" playthrough (that of just following what the game tells you to do).

 

The characters in this case are fantastic. Solomon Starbuck is a likable defendant, and hearing about his traumatic experience in space is genuinely spine-chilling. Yuri Cosmos is among the funniest characters in the series, but anytime he's in his ""dizzy"" sprite I feel bad for him, especially during the next case. Aura Blackquill is... well I'll save my thoughts for her later.

 

In terms of the Clay stuff, I found three noticeable sections of dialogue:

 

\---------------

 

*Starbuck: Clay always used to cheerfully greet me in a loud voice.*

 

*Phoenix: And he did vocal exercises every morning, sometimes until he was hoarse, right?*

 

*Starbuck: Exactly. You could always hear him, even through the wall -- Hey, wait a minute. Did you know Clay?*

 

*Phoenix: No, but like attracts like, as they say.*

 

*..........*

 

*Apollo: When I became a lawyer... ...Clay was the first person I showed this badge to. He was so happy for me, it was like he just became a lawyer himself.*

 

*Phoenix: You two were really great friends, weren't you?*

 

*Apollo: Yeah, but we were rivals, too. We fought to see who would make their dream come true first. But now...*

 

*Phoenix: (Apollo...)*

 

*..........*

 

*Apollo: Clay... He finally became an astronaut, just like he always wanted... How could this have happened just before his big launch?*

 

*Phoenix: It's such a sad waste...*

 

*Apollo: I'll never forgive the person who murdered him!*

 

*Phoenix: I completely understand why you feel that way, Apollo... ...but keep in mind, too, that our job as defense attorneys is to save our client.*

 

*Apollo: I know that. That's why I...! No, never mind...*

 

*Phoenix: Huh?*

 

\---------------

 

These, alongside Apollo's entire talking section at the end of the investigation section of the case, are enough for me to understand Clay as a character and sympathize with Apollo's loss. As for the Phantom's identity, I completely overlooked three MAJOR sections of dialogue that REALLY helps matters.

 

\---------------

 

*Phoenix: You were here at the Space Center at the time of the incidents, weren't you, Detective?*

 

*Fulbright: That's right! I was here on a security assignment!*

 

*Athena: The police are required to secure rocket launches now? I didn't know that.*

 

*Fulbright: U-Um, yes. Well, you know us! To serve and protect! Ha ha ha ha! The explosions occurred while I was here on duty, so I started leading the evacuation!*

 

*Phoenix: (He's leaving out a lot of details, but okay...)*

 

*..........*

 

*Athena: So where were you when the first bomb went off?*

 

*Fulbright: I was on duty on the fourth floor. It was quite the madhouse, I tell you! The elevator wasn't working, on account of the explosion... ...and the stairs on the second floor were destroyed, so we couldn't go that way.*

 

*Athena: Then wasn't it impossible to get down to the basement shelter?*

 

*Fulbright: No. We lowered an emergency ladder from a fourth floor window and escaped that way. It was a folding ladder, so it wasn't very stable, but at least it reached the ground! After I secured the ladder, I left to take another look around for any other survivors. Once everyone else got out safely, I made my way down, too, and headed to the shelter.*

 

*..........*

 

*Fulbright: When the explosions occurred, everyone was on the verge of panic. But the important thing is that no one from the general public was hurt. And it was all thanks to the evacuation effort we headed up!*

 

*Phoenix: After that, you escaped the building yourself as well, right?*

 

*Fulbright: Me? Escape?! Nonsense! I wanted to run straight towards the blasts! It was the other detectives who stopped me. ""We gotta get you to somewhere safe, sir!"" they said.*

 

*Phoenix: I know you wanted to help, but it sounds like you were adding work to your fellow officers.*

 

\---------------

 

When you combine this with the fantastic investigation section, the great first trial section with Apollo's inner thoughts and turmoil, as well as both Yuri Cosmos' stand on Day 2 with the major twist of the space center being swapped, and I think I can now move this case from just A Tier to A+ Tier.

 

**Final Score: Great \[A+\]**

 

[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney: Dual Destinies - Turnabout for Tomorrow](https://preview.redd.it/igu7230yw4ef1.png?width=2657&format=png&auto=webp&s=27599b1e06cb9feedde8b7deb87770212e3fdb07)

**Case 5: Turnabout for Tomorrow**

 

Welp. It's my favorite final case in the series.

 

This case managed to not only managed to give Apollo Justice a genuine character arc (and a great one at that), perfectly wrap up the past of Athena Cykes and Simon Blackquill, actually deal with the Dark Age of the Law that Apollo Justice said existed without doing anything about it, give a satisfying explanation for why this Dark Age of the Law was so different and intense compared to the one in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, and wrap up the history of the Cosmos Space Center, but they ALSO managed to give us Miles Edgeworth (who I argue still acts in character, and impressively even MORE so given the context of Prosecutor's Gambit, which I foolishly didn't play that and Investigations: Miles Edgeworth until after Spirit of Justice) and an exceptional logical mystery with an INSANELY strong emotional core. In other words, we're dealing with character growth that's on par with the likes of Bridge to the Turnabout.

 

I was utterly shocked by the cliffhanger in the prior case (The Cosmic Turnabout), and seeing Aura take hostages make the stakes feel as high as they could be, but with the addition of Simon being on Death Row, it's even harsher, and actually makes it feel like if we don't solve it now, we're SCREWED (unlike Turnabout Goodbyes where since we were only doing the DL-6 incident at the absolute tail end of that case, I didn't feel the pressure). So not only are we dealing with the tight time limit and stress levels reminiscent of Farewell, My Turnabout, but we're also having the satisfaction of solving a supposedly cold case from the past like Turnabout Goodbyes... But that's not even all of it.

 

Because Athena Cykes is the one accused of murdering her own mother. The argument given by the prosecution (unlike the one in Turnabout Succession for the Mishams) is VERY convincing and leaves next to no logical arguments we can counter with, INCLUDING motive, arguably the MOST important factor of any prosecutor's stance when accusing a child of murdering their parent. However, Simon Blackquill is desperate to hide and deny everything because he's scared of the truth. That's right, we're also dealing with the horrific revelations that's reminiscent of Rise from the Ashes with the idea that Simon, like Lana before him, is trying to cover up the murder that he thinks Athena, like Ema before her, committed.

 

So, this case literally takes all the highs of all four of the Phoenix Wright Trilogy's finales, and all for the better... and now we also have a new factor: The twist villain. The Phantom....

 

Bobby Fulbright. I know everyone on this subreddit and their mother hates the Phantom, but I still find the logical build-up to his reveal to be phenomenal. Why? Because it was the first time, I genuinely stopped trying to play the game to try to figure it out. Specifically, when Edgeworth turned my ""knife is the true weapon"" theory to become completely useless. I stopped playing right there and dug through every single fact of the case I could recall trying to solve it then and there. This is the ONLY time I've ever done this in the series. And, as unbelievable as it might seem to you, I managed to deduce it was Bobby.

When Phoenix was in his “it’s so over” pose where he has his elbows on the bench and his face on the bench with his hands holding his head down, I stopped playing the game, because I was TERRIFIED at the possibility that Athena was the culprit. So, I looked for any possible excuse… then I recalled that the robot mentioned that when the hug happened, Metis’s heart rate spiked up.

 

But that contradicted the autopsy report! This meant that that hug couldn’t have been the moment of the murder. But given that Athena was yelling at someone, I figured that she had to have stabbed someone with the utility knife. Then I looked at the crime scene photo and found a handkerchief next to Metis’s body. I realized that, somehow, Metis had her face covered.

 

Then I recalled how Apollo was mistaken for Clay by the Robot. This made me realize that Metis was already dead at the time. Given that there were only 2 living people in that room, I concluded that Athena didn’t stab her mother, but instead a third party. But I needed to know who she stabbed.

 

Then I recalled Yuri Cosmos mentioning that the Spy was the culprit of both incidents. So, whoever killed Clay Terran had to be the culprit. So, I thought long and hard on that escape sequence. You see, the culprit had to have escaped through the boarding lounge. It was then I recalled some leaves.

 

At the time I was confused at the leaves, as they were uncrumpled. This meant that someone either deliberately brought them there (which made no sense, as there’s no reason to bring some leaves), or it flew from the outside. If it flew from the outside, this meant that while the station was rotating, the door opened.

 

So, I thought “oh yeah! The culprit could’ve just jumped to the ladder brought down by Aura!” But I quickly determined it was impossible given the distance, unless they knew about the ladder beforehand.

 

And then it clicked. The person responsible for bringing down the ladder was ordered by someone else to do so. The only other person who would know that a ladder was there to jump to. Bobby Fulbright

 

I also believe that there are far fewer plot holes with The Phantom than one might initially suspect with him. I’ll go over some noticeable foreshadowing and “plot holes” people have with him. I won’t be covering direct lines of dialogue because I already did that for The Cosmic Turnabout.

 

**#1:** Bobby Fulbright not only goes out of his way to slander Simon Blackquill's name (as seen with him warning Apollo during 5-2 about how twisted and corrupt Simon is, despite in the very same case Simon's reasoning against having another investigation day being that it could give the defense time to forge evidence, alongside the fact that Simon, due to being in prison, cannot forge anything), not only allows Simon to lash out so others can see how dangerous he is (despite how he could have just re-placed the shackles on Simon after anytime Simon breaks the shackles), but also goes out of his way to ELECTROCUTE Simon multiple times (sometimes for no reason at all, as seen with him electrocuting Simon during 5-3 when Simon attempts to leave due to finding the situation to be far too ridiculous, despite Bobby allowing Simon to do the very same thing prior when Hugh tries to talk about a body double). Due to the series having Franziska whip people and Godot throw scalding coffee at others, we don't really recognize this for how harmful it is and instead think ""oh it's just a quirk"", when, in hindsight, of COURSE The Phantom would want to torture the one man who has evidence on him.

 

**#2:** Bobby Fulbright's anger animation has the scar on his hand that was left from the UR-1 Incident. At first, we look at it and think ""oh it's just an anime vein exposed thing, it's not plot relevant"", and we don't question it because he constantly has gloves on him (so we can't see the scar).

 

**#3:** Bobby Fulbright actively seeks to frame Athena Cykes and undermine Simon Blackquill during 5-4. As we see during the end of 5-4, he presents the lighter at the absolute last second. Given that this evidence directly frames Athena Cykes, and that he only wants to reveal that it belongs to Athena Cykes AFTER the court had reached its ruling, it's fair to say that Simon Blackquill wouldn't have enough time to come up with any possible rebuttal. Not to mention that he also gave us the fake fingerprint data.

 

**#4:** Evacuation Ladder line by Aura Blackquill. Aura Blackquill explicitly states that there were other ladders available to use that would've been easier to utilize, and that she was confused on why the detective refused to use any other ladders.

 

**#5:** In-Justice We Trust. Self-Explanatory.

 

Now to counter some ""Plot-Holes""

 

**#1: Why didn't Phoenix's Psyche Locks react when he says, ""I am Bobby Fulbright""?** Good point, but you must recall how Psyche Locks work. In Farewell, My Turnabout, we ask Matt Engarde if he killed Juan Corrida. Despite ordering his death, Matt truly believes that he did not kill Juan Corrida, despite him being responsible for Juan's death. During 5-5, The Phantom states that ""I can change identities at will! I can be anyone I want!"". If we take this literally, then the Phantom truly believes that he IS Bobby Fulbright, and thus because The Phantom believes it to be the truth, no Psyche Locks appear.

 

**#2: Why did Apollo not perceive Bobby's Lies?** Good question, and a simple answer for this as well. Perceive works when someone is doing a sort of fidget. It is not an explicit ""Lie Detector"", but instead, something that allows him to tell whenever someone exhibits tension. You can lie to others without feeling or exhibiting tension or a fidget. Thus, no perceive. It's only whenever the Phantom talks about the Earth Emblem does The Phantom fidget, or exhibit tension, because he knows about the secret gun.

 

**#3: Why didn't Athena notice a lack of emotions from Bobby?** This has the most interesting explanation. Athena Cykes can hear emotions from everyone. So, imagine you're at an inside party. There's music, there's noise, there's people talking all around you. However, unbeknownst to you, the air conditioner is off. Until you start to feel the temperature rise to a degree where you're convinced that it's not just the atmosphere or the drinks, but the AC is off, you won't be able to determine that there's no air blowing from the air conditioner. Now, let's say you learn from your mistakes, and this time actively listen for any noise from the air conditioner. Only then will you hear that there's no noise coming from it. This is the exact same thing Athena does with The Phantom. She doesn't hear the noise but doesn't notice the lack of noise due to having people around her whenever Bobby is in the room. However, once she knows to listen for a lack of emotions whenever Bobby testifies, she does, and only then does she fully realize the lack of emotions.

 

**#4: Why didn't Bobby start to fake his emotions earlier?** Because the moment he starts faking his emotions, Athena is going to notice a change in emotional input from Bobby. Besides, we see from Bobby how hard it is to make his emotions feel consistent. He'd have to practice day in and day out on something that not only wouldn't guarantee his survival, but also directly jeopardize his value as a Spy, with his claim of having a severe lack of emotions. He has no idea when or where his next assignment would be. What if he was in the process of trying to undo his emotional restriction when a new assignment appears? He can't guarantee that the mission would go perfectly despite the emotions he has. On this point, how could he have made the jump during 5-4/5 with emotions? He started faking his emotions as a last-resort (which would've been his last-resort had it not been for Blackquill cutting his mask).

 

To talk on Aura Blackquill because I did promise that: From the moment Simon was arrested, Aura knew her brother was innocent. And her anger towards the legal system only amplified because the murdered victim was Metis, someone who Simon knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that she loved. However, when using the process of elimination, she figured the only person who could have possibly murdered Metis was Metis’s child: Athena. This realization was shocking and infuriating at the same time. She can’t just go up to the courts and declare that Athena was the culprit, as she was the victim’s daughter. But to Aura, the process of elimination doesn’t lie. So, she was effectively caught between an anvil and its hammer, where her only possible genuine method of reopening the case is convincing her brother to plead not guilty.... But her brother wouldn’t.

 

By the end of 5-4, Aura is on her last leg. If she doesn’t do something drastic, she will effectively lose everything she ever cared for, with her brother’s execution. So, she goes to extreme lengths to ensure whatever possible revenge she can. I believe by the end of the jail cell conversation with Simon; she has truly given up hope on reopening UR-1. After all, she spent the past 7 years attempting to demand it to be reopened. So, her second-best option is exact revenge. So, just as Adrian did, she goes to extreme lengths to exact revenge. She holds hostages and demands Athena. I truly believe that her original goal was to reopen UR-1, but by that point, she figured it would be impossible, and by consequence would be demanding Simon’s release when his execution is the next day, so she goes for the next best solution, exacting revenge on Athena. As she claims in 5-4, she wouldn’t want the legal system to find someone who murdered her closest friend “guilty”, as she’d rather kill them herself.... So, when Phoenix asks her if she would be willing to compromise and reopen UR-1, she agrees.

 

If all she wanted was revenge against Athena, she would’ve just demanded Athena and started breaking bones if they didn’t comply. But she allows for the trial to rerun because this will effectively allow Simon, the only living person who is keeping her going even if he doesn’t know it, to be found innocent. So, she allows it. She allows for the trial to be rerun, and demands Phoenix defend Athena. I know that deep down, she really doesn’t want to find Athena guilty. This is why whenever she is (in her body, not Clonco) at the courtroom, she doesn’t speak with animosity towards Athena, but with joy towards Simon. Overall, I'd put her among my 15 favorite characters in the series.

 

But that ending.... Seeing Athena Cykes cry tears of joy at the end of this case? That, right there, is my 2nd favorite moment in this entire series, and got me sobbing. Not only did this case bring me to my emotionally lowest (what Simon saw), put my deductive prowess to the limit (with how could Athena NOT be the culprit behind her mother's murder), give me one of the most liberating feelings I've felt in any game (seeing Athena's Black Psyche-Locks shatter), but it also gave me that final scene of Athena Cykes crying tears of joy.

 

The distance in quality between this case and my favorite case of all time (A Turnabout Forsaken) is so minuscule that I could be swayed to put this case as my favorite case of all time. It's close. REALLY close.

Why? Because I'm bored, I like solving workflow puzzles, and honestly, I learn something new every time I help someone figure out their weird edge case. Plus the n8n community has helped me out plenty of times.

What I can help with:

* Workflow architecture (stop making everything one giant workflow, please)
* API integrations that are making you question your sanity
* Performance optimisation
* Error handling
* Migrating from Zapier/Make without wanting to throw your laptop out the window

What I probably can't help with:

* ""Build my entire SaaS for me"" type requests LOL
* Anything that requires me to touch your production data directly
* Workflows involving questionable legality

How this works:

1. Comment or DM me with what you're trying to build
2. I'll let you know if I can help
3. We hop on a quick call or do it async
4. I help you get unstuck

I did an online quiz and the Profitec Drive came up as the best result for what I am making on a daily basis (I feel like they just want to recommend an expensive machine if you have the budget!). I have a friend who has the Rocket Apartamento so I have an idea of how to use a more advanced machine than the Breville Barista Pro. I do not make a ton of milk based drinks on my own, but something I make often for guests, the double boiler is an extra upgrade that sounds great but not sure if it is worth the cost? What other features does this machine have, say over the LELIT Bianca or the Rocket Apartamento (still not sure what upgraded features on the TCA vs normal). 

Another machine I have considered is a LM-either Mini or Micro. I know the Mini is above the stated budget, but I do have expensive taste... Buy once, cry once as my mother always says! But, not sure if this machine just has a gold standard around it for the name or is actually something to look into and invest in now while I am already going to spend a good chunk of change. 

I live in a rental so am unable to plumb a machine in, so taking that into consideration. I also do not plan to mess with the flow control settings right away, which I know is a selling point of the more expensive machines.

i feel like part of the issue is my sidewalls don’t grow out perfectly straight, they tend to have a slight curve to them and right at the deepest part of the curve is where they tend to crack (always below the quick. of course). i am oiling daily, only changing polish once a week, keeping length very reasonable, and doing my very best to be careful. and still the cracking continues!

has anyone else experienced this? would i be crazy to go back to filing down the sidewalls? 😅

also my offering to you all is the most sturdy patching method i have discovered is small pieces of band-aids that have a bit of stretch to them. i find they are much less frail than the coffee filter/tea bag method, if a little thicker and more annoying to file down.

I was fine with it and have respected that boundary ever since then. We’re still really good friends as well, but sometimes I find myself catching feelings again. It’s not anything that really impacts me emotionally, but I do notice it when we do hangout sometimes, especially if it’s just the two of us.

There are too many people to remember them all, so forgive me if I forget your name. I need your help, I don't know how I wound up in this situation but I seem to have been ground hog day'd. I have seen the world ending thousands of times and I need someone to help me.



It wasn't world ending apocalypses initially it started out with small things, I'd get hit by a car and die, so the next time round I would wait till the car went past, then cross the street. Just little things like that, after the first hundred or so times around though, things started to get a little more extreme, the first such example was a man with a knife who charged me and stabbed me to death, so I called the police ahead of time. They made it, stopped him from attacking me and hit me with a stray bullet when the knife man charged them. After that, I took a different route to the coffee shop. The first time I actually made it to the coffee shop a gas line exploded when I arrived and killed me, and, I assume everyone else there at the same time.



After that I decided to try and leave town, so I went to catch a train, which promptly derailed and took out everyone on the platform as it did so. The strange thing is though, that I checked the news while I was on the platform and the gas line didn't explode this time around.



That got me thinking, if bad things were only happening to kill me, what if I just stayed home and waited it out. Well, the only time I tried that I was the victim of a plane crash in my own livingroom. I decided that my best course of action was to wander the city for the day and do my best to be aware of my surroundings, and wouldn't you know it, it got me further than anything I'd tried so far, but ultimately failed when we were hit with a chemical weapon strike



At that point I came to the decision that I should stay away from crowds to minimize the casualties, the problem was that I didn't own a car, so my options were public transport or walk, and public transport hadn't treated me well today. I started walking first thing in the morning, by noon I was on the city outskirts with lifestyle blocks lining the highway. I made sure to stay well away from any vehicle that I saw on the road. That, of course, didn't stop the bombs from killing me. I turned around after the bright flash and, a couple seconds later, woke up back in my bed. The next few attempts I tried running, but for the first time, the exact cause of death repeated itself. That's when I realized that the only way to prevent an event was to be safely out of it's reach. I spent a few attempts trying to find the most accessible bike I could to “borrow”, after a few attempts I found that one of the bikes at the convenience store had been left unlocked. That time I made it to the next town over, turns out, they were quite earthquake prone. It took a few attempts, but I eventually found a safe spot to weather the earth quake.



The declaration of war came next several world leaders were assassinated all at once and everyone blamed everyone else, and then the missiles began to fly, and, surprise surprise, the first nuke hit the town in was in. Interestingly enough, if I didn't go to that town, the war didn't happen, I figured that since I was far enough from that first nuke that I didn't die immediately, then it had to be a different cause of death.



I had taken to keeping up with the news to try and avoid anything that seemed dangerous. I basically gave up when I saw that a virus had swept across more than half of the Continental United States in a matter of hours, leaving very few survivors in its wake. The experts were saying 97% of the population was dead within 5 minutes of first symptoms, and believe me, it was not a comfortable 5 minutes. After that I tried to break the loop myself a couple of times, if you catch my drift. That, evidently also didn't work. That's when I had an idea scuba gear should have enough oxygen for me to last at least the initial pass of the virus, and if the pattern holds, that meant that it wouldn't happen at all. I was right, I looked like an idiot in a stolen scuba mask, but I was right. That still didn't stop the meteor though, and that's where I've been stuck for the past few hundred days, 3.37pm, the world ends. And I don't know if there is any way, aside from breaking the time loop, to stop it. Which brings us to the reason I'm writing this now. I think I have figured out a way to break it. I've spent a few decades at this point studying mythology about time loops and I think I know which one I'm in.



Are you familiar with the concept of purgatory? Well, it's kind of like that, except, I'm not dead yet, and it's contagious. It's a punishment and once I have made amends and atoned for my sins, I believe I will be set free. It also turns out that, by sharing my knowledge I have spread the reach of this curse. Thank you all, for taking on a portion of my suffering and making penance for my sins.



If you want my advice, don't dodge the car, it hurts a lot less than the feeling of you lungs liquefying in you chest.

1m56glz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReddXReads/comments/1m56glz/tales_of_community_college_artlad_vs_goodfella_vs/,Tales of Community College: Artlad vs Goodfella vs Sourface (part 6),"Hello once again dear readers and Reddx, I back to continue this saga. This WILL be filled with both cringy gross-out and a little bit of hope! This time however we'll getting more Artlad and Sourface. (Again sorry for my grammar but I think I'm learning...kinda)

***There's to many people in this part so they'll pop up as we go.***

**TIME TO START DIGGING!**

So the last time we left off, Goodfella is telling me that my cousin has ulterior motives to begging me to come back. I however know my family well and he wasn't convinced. So I moved back to my cousin's but this time her husband was there and he give his two-cents. So long story short, my cousin and her husband apologized, so did I and agreed if I was going to stay there, I need a job and help pay for stuff. I'm speeding running this cuz one: not really important and just leading up the trash fire and two: I want to talk about the cringe!

As I was unpacking my stuff, I get a text from Artlad saying ""what the hell is wrong with me"". Confused, I texted back:

**Me: What are talking about?**

**Artlad: You know what I'm talking about!**

**Me: No I don't!**

**Artlad: Sourface called me and told me you spit on his face and kicked his junk!**

**Me: Did he tell you why?**

**Artlad: All he did is just say hi!!!**

This isn't word for word but it's close. My blood was boiling cuz these cry-bully is out there making himself the victim when he basically called my family dirty. So I told Artlad the truth and asked him why the fuck should I NOT kick an asshole's junk. Artlad had no idea that Sourface said that and put me on a three-way call, once again long story short, Artlad being mad was an understatement. Sourface basically admitted what happened is true but fucking doubled down. I'm not going to repeat what Sourface said cuz it's mostly him being un-self-aware. But, in a rare moment, Artlad did something ""smart"" and said point blank ""I guess being racist comes with the territory of fucking your cousin"". I was trying not to laugh because Artlad didn't tell him I was there but Sourface scoffed and basically said ""She was my step-cousin and beaners are lazy good-for-nothings anyway"", I saw red and ignoring the plan I flat out told him that it was rich of him calling my people ""lazy good-for-nothings"" when he doesn't have a job and bitches to his mama for her ""money nipple"". (FYI I don't know that's how you say it but it's a translation of an old Mexican saying). I made a bad mistake, Artlad got real quite and Sourface was trying to down play both his bullshit thinking about Latinos and his dependence on his parents. I just hung up, no point to argue with stupid but I was pretty sure this wasn't the end of that. If I was going to hang around Goodfella then I have to deal with Sourface since he seems to not let things go until he ""wins"".

That night, Artlad calls me back asking if I was ok and was rethinking his friendship with Sourface. Gee I wonder why?/s I was also starting to wonder why is he still hanging around Sourface when Sourface himself has proven to be a very shitty friend. I simple told him that not tonight, I was dealing with family stuff an maybe we should revisit this some other time. Then Sr. Cholo call me saying I'm needed in two days cuz of ""big work"", keep this in the back burner. That night after talking more with my cousin and her family and also confirming she's not using me, I texted Goodfella. I told everything that happened and this part I should have taken it as a red flag. Not to give everything away but Goodfella might have hinted he and Fey missed my ""cuddly vibe and wish to keep going"". I spend my time there mostly being sad about my cousin's words and worrying about my living situation and what would my folks think of me and ended up crying myself to sleep. I 100% remember I did not have a good time since oh I don't know Sourface showed up angry too! Also we hardly ""cuddled"", so this whole ""I miss you *buddy*"" seemed off in hindsight. But I didn't and this push us to the next day and I thought I should go back to the college town and have a moment to self-reflect and ponder why did I put myself into this mess. Months ago, before the whole starting community college and Queenie saga, I just got out of high school, never taken drugs, never really partied, hang out with Artlad, Bestbro and Bestgal from time to time and was living in a very boring life. But in my drug addled mind, I figured it was temporary and maybe should ask Artlad if there was any parties going on so I could go and forget! Cuz that's what I need, distractions! To nobody's surprise, Artlad has three parties lined up and one of them is coming up soon. I asked if I could go and he said yes. Of course is at the same frat-house from earlier in this saga. However, what's eating at me is this whole Sourface not being able to take a no. I figured I need to find a way to step away from that or at less have a convo with Goodfella about his brother. Even though it was winter break before the start of spring semester I can't be diving head first to bullshit but I was 19, I thought talking things out should be good enough. But I won't be writing this if it was that easy and if I wasn't a dumdass. After some time I when to Artlad's place to hang out.

Artlad being Artlad, thought I was wanted to hang out but I wanted to talk about where we left off with Sourface. Again it wasn't word for word but it went like:

**Artlad: Dizzy wanna play some FIFA or something.**

**Me: Artlad I want to talk about Sourface.**

**Artlad: Oh! Right...**

**Me: Do you like hanging out with Sourface? I find him very negative to be around.**

**Artlad: Not really but I figured he just needs a good friend.**

**Me: Artlad, he doesn't treat anyone kindly.**

**Artlad: Maybe he needs a little push.**

**Me: Artlad, he came to his little brother's apartment, demanded him to let him stay, then got into a fight, breaking things and leaving because his brother's roommate was about to call the cops. All because he was jealous. I know because I was right there when it happened.**

**Artlad: \*sigh\* To be honest, Sourface just shows up and I always end up feeling drain.**

**Me: Do you need help cutting off the friendship?**

**Artlad: Nah, in fact I was planning to tell him at the party that's coming up but not before....**

**Me: Not before what?**

**Artlad: I uhhh.....I promise him that I'll help get a girlfriend. Guarantee!**

Now, I didn't know to respond to that. On one hand, there's nothing wrong with someone trying to wingman their pal or help them with relationship advice. But on the other hand, this is fucking Artlad, the man known to jump into relationships to relationship as if it was a simple outfit change. I brought up his style change in the beginning of this saga but though out I wasn't really about it cuz the ""change"" lasted no more then two days before he when back to his sporty look. He when though the ""cowboy look"", emo, punk, alt, my style that I would describe as ""laundry-day-alt"" and finally a style that commonly seen in young Latino spaces and it's the ""2016 Pitbull outfit look"". During those times, this mofo was sending in a group chat my friends and I shared about ""his lay that day, total 10/10"". No joke. I'm explaining this because I'm trying to wrap my head around the idea of him helping Sourface get a girlfriend. I asked if this was a good idea since one, he's planning to cut the friendship and two, Sourface seemed to much effort even I'm starting to think his own parents are getting sick of his shit. With a big smile he said that yes, it a good idea cuz ""he going too busy getting busy with the girl and going on dates and shit"". I didn't say much after that cuz moot point but that leads us to the day of Sr. Cholo's shop where I have to be there.

Sr. Cholo wanted me to be there cuz he was about to ""do some things"" and didn't want to close the shop so I had to run the shop alone but I can't complain cuz I'm getting paid. In the middle of my shift, he called saying if someone enters with a single box, take him to the back. And lo and behold, a shade-y looking dude came in with a box asking for Sr. Cholo and I took him to the back of the store. The box when he place it sounded like it had pill bottles and curiosity got the better of me and I asked. Long story short, he came my new dealer for molly. With a new fresh bottle of pills, I began to think maybe Artlad's plan could work. I texted Artlad that day after I close up shop asking if I could help him get Sourface a GF. I was also contemplating whether or not to tell Goodfella. I thought nah, not important. To skip the boring stuff, Artlad and I agreed that the up-coming party at Big Billy's place would be the ""best"" place to act on the plan. Artlad had already thought up of a plan and all I have to do is to be the ""gay bestie"". To note, my voice was getting deep, deep enough to sound boyish but not quite man-ish. Again I'm explaining this to get an idea on how fucking dumb and not well planned this shit was.

Artlad asked me to come by to his place because ""he needed me for something important"". I march my high-ass to Artlad's and came to see not only Artlad, but also Bestbro looking like he's ready to cut a bitch and good ol' Sourface. Bestbro took one look at me and seemed to make a face before saying ""Oh hey Dizzy, you're here to help?"" Artlad with his goofy smile, padded my back saying:

**Artlad: YUP! He promised me he'll help Sourface get a girl!**

**Bestbro:** \*looking dead into my eyes, with a voice that made my blood ran cold\* **Soo, Dizzy, how are you feeling? I haven't heard from you in a while.**

**Me: Sorry dude, been busy.**

Sourface then got up all angry and saying:

**Sourface: HELL NO! THIS BASTARD BROKE MY NOSE, SPIT IN MY FACE AND NOW WANTS TO HELP?**

He use the word ""broke"" but he didn't have a band-aid or something like that, no instead he just had a bruised on his nose and I don't remember if any blood did came out.

**Me: I'm helping you not because we can ""friends"" but because this is the only way to leave me and your brother alone! Maybe having a girl in your sad little life will motive your fat-ass.**

**Sourface: You act all high and mighty but you're just as worst then anyone! You're so delusional but I should have known since you think you can be a man when you'll never be, always a woman.**

Artlad and Bestbro had this look of ""uh oh this is getting off"" but I was starting to get fed up with everything and misplace my anger on unhealthy ways, I went with something cringy.

**Me: You talk big for someone that's still suckling on mommy's money nipple. You can't even man-up to get a place without throwing a tantrum.**

**Sourface: Wanna fight? If you think you're a man then fucking fight me!**

**Artlad: GUYS! Please don't!**

**Bestbro: Are you fucking for real?**

**Me: I got rid of Queenie! I can get rid of you too Sourface. I could easily gather stuff that'll either make your folks disown you or make you a total loser among your friends. Pick. Your. Battle.**

**Sourface: Pfft. BULL!**

**Me: Try me bitch!**

Bestbro being the ""dad friend"" got between us with his ""I'm done with this shit"" look and says:

**Bestbro: Shut the fuck up already!**

**Me: And why are you here? I thought you hate Sourface.**

**Sourface: He doesn't hate me! You're just saying that cuz you're jealous.**

**Bestbro: SHUT UP! I DO HATE YOU! And Artlad told me everything! You causing a scene at your brother's place. Calling Dizzy's family dirty Mexicans and I had it with your bitching! I came here because Artlad told me there's something important but this shit?**

**Artlad: GUYS GUYS! Please, don't fight. I can fix this and help Sourface! I just needed help!**

**Bestbro: Help with what? I wanted to talk about the party is coming up and not have to deal with this!**

**Me: Uhhhhh.....Bestbro....**

**Bestbro: What?**

**Me: Artlad wants us to help Sourface at said party. I think this is why we're here. Right?**

**Bestbro: FOR FUCK SAKES!**

**Artlad: Bestbro I think this is a good idea.**

**Bestbro: Artlad, We've talked about this. Stop. Doing. Stupid. Shit!**

**Me: Look, How about a deal?**

**Sourface: Why?**

And to that I told him that I was curious if Artlad could really help him get a girlfriend or at less help him get laid and it was true. This isn't a cringy teen/college movie where bros help bros get laid and something about drama and hijinks. No this is real life and I was willing to do anything to have some peace in my life even if I was dealing with a molly problem. Of course my drug problem was mine and mine alone. Maybe I thought having Sourface out of sight with a gf would was doing Goodfella a solid. But Bestbro was having none of it when it comes to Artlad's plan. Sourface, in a way had every right to be pissed off at me for one: kicking his nose in and Two: spitting on his face. However, I was shocked his folks wasn't kicking down my door but I figured he didn't want to tell them that a ""girl beat his ass"".

To make a long story short, Artlad ""convinced"" Bestbro to help out but I believe it was mostly keeping eye on things. Sourface ""agreed"" to have me help and I ""agreed"" to not kick Sourface again. I feel like a piece of shit cuz looking back I had too much anger build up in me and starting testosterone and taking molly, yeah it made me have a short fuse. Also combine that with un-medicated ADHD, you're just asking for trouble. Now what was Artlad's totally awesome plan? Well if I remember correctly, the first step is to change Sourface's style. Like, change his wardrobe. On one hand, he's kinda right, Sourface did dress like your typical Neckbeard just minus the facial hair and he at less wore clean clothes and showered. But on the other, what needs changing is his god-awful attitude. Now Sometimes the way you dress is how you present to others right? Artlad went on to explain this as if he totally thought it up himself and it's a totally new thing while Bestbro and I just waited to see his conclusion. Sourface however took this as ""disrespecting his honor"". Sourface yelled a mighty ""fuck you"" to Artlad, calling him a pervert (no I'm not joking nor know why) then goes on how ""you're just a pretty boy with AIDS and my clothes are just fine and you get laid cuz you're skinny"". With a faceplam Bestbro says:

**Bestbro: You stupid fuck-ass, he meant putting some effort!**

I intervene to add:

**Me: It's not the clothes it's self but how you match your clothes Sourface. Maybe if we find something what you have now at home.**

Artlad then goes on with ""yeah see! Dizzy and Bestbro know what I'm talking about! Come on dude, let's get your pussy magnet clothes!"". Sourface huffs out a ""fine"" but we had to do it now since his folks aren't home and wouldn't be until much later. We all entered to Sourface's lifted F-150 and Bestbro and I had the displeasure to take the backseat and dear god the fucking smell! Me and Bestbro had to move bags of fast food with food still in them, really old milkshake bottles that some of them started to have mold and very crispy tissue papers. At less the seats had covers, sure they may have half naked ladies on them but hey, at less he preserved the seats. I also notice he had so many bottles of that muscle milk drink so I asked:

**Me: Hey Sourface, do drink this protein stuff?**

**Sourface: Yeah duh!**

**Me: I didn't know you replace meals with protein shakes.**

**Sourface: Replace?**

**Bestbro: Dizzy, these aren't slim-fast.**

**Artlad: They're for gym bros to build muscle!**

**Sourface: And they work too?**

**Me: Huh? Do they?**

**Sourface: Yup I'm up 10 pounds of pure muscle since drinking those bad boys.**

**Me: Since when you started going to the gym? Maybe if you keep going, you'll 100% lose weight.**

**Sourface: I'M NOT GOING TO THE GYM! Gyms are for low IQ monkeys who can't even read and watch sports.**

**Me: Then how did you gain 10lbs of muscle?**

That's when I saw Bestbro pinched the bridge of his nose and Artlad trying not to laugh, Sourface then explains that on the bottle said ""build muscle fast, with this amount of protein and blah blah blah"", My dumbass self thought he was drinking these as a meal replacer while in reality, this fucker believed simply drinking these will make him look like Arnold WITHOUT GOING TO THE GYM. he gain 10lbs of fat not muscle. There's a reason why I used to be friends Artlad, I'm not that far behind. I simply replied ""yeah I'll stick to slim-fast"" while I keep stepping on crunchy napkins. For some reason, Sourface got mad about it. He literally yelled me ""Quit doing gay shit back there!"" and I said ""dude, your car is a mess and I keep stepping on hard napkins!"" He yelled to stop doing gay shit again and something about maybe I like the ""real man smell"" or something like but what is stuck in my head is when Bestbro yelled back ""What's so gay about stepping on crispy paper?"" He point-blank admitted when he gets the ""urge"" he will find any napkins he has then he just drives and jerks-off at the same time then throws the used napkin on the backseat. I was just hoping it was simply fast food wrappers with food still on them and just thought he simply called anything gay. But no, I could have gotten my whole life not knowing about this. The first time I've told this story to someone they asked how did he not crash? I have no idea and I was too stunned to care.

We made it Sourface's place and he check to see if anyone was home, no one was there. Good, we made our way to Sourface's room and the same smell when I was helping Goodfella move his things was still there and stronger. Remember, Sourface wears clean clothes and does not smell bad so this was already off-putting. As we entered, I figure out why does it smell, PISS BOTTLES EVERYWHERE! Bestbro let out a WTF and Artlad was confused as to why Sourface didn't threw out the bottles. Sourface wave a dismissive hand and saying ""it's not a big deal. Don't act like his harpy mom"". Whatever, I made my way to the closet to see the clothes he has and Sourface cracked a ""joke"" about ""knowing a thing or two about closets"". I've heard better jokes TBH. As I search, half of his clothes were a few sizes too small.

**Bestbro: See something good?**

**Me: Dude, Sourface, half your clothes are kinda small. Do you still have clothes from when you're a kid?**

**Sourface: No. My mom used to clear my closet to buy new one for the new school year. Last time she did that is when I was in my last year of high school.**

**Artlad: Are you sure they're small on him?**

I pull out a t-shirt that look to be four sizes too small.

**Me: Yeah dude, there's no way this still fits. It's fine if it doesn't, we can still buy some new ones.**

**Sourface: Bullshit! They still fit!**

**Bestbro: I don't know man, that does look rather small.**

**Sourface: Nah uh! I'll show you!**

Sourface removes the shirt he was wearing, I handed him the one on my hand and it does not cover his stomach.

**Artlad: Huh...Sourface....**

**Sourface: Shut up! It still fits!**

As soon as he move one of his arms, we all heard a loud \*riiiiiiip\*, there's now a giant hole from the armpit all the way to his back, the sleeve is completely ripped. I've dealt with outfit malfunction before so I know how embarrassing that could be so to ease this tension I say:

**Me: It's ok Sourface! We can still find something else.**

**Artlad: I think we should pull out the ones that don't fit anymore.**

**Sourface: No they all fit! I swear!**

**Bestbro: Really Sourface?**

Sourface was so sure that it was the one that didn't fit and insisted he tried the ones we ""claimed"" doesn't fit. We spend a good two hours of just Sourface trying on a shirt or a pair of pants, moves around, cue the \*riiiiip\* sound, me or Artlad has to help him remove the clothing in question, rinse and repeat. Bestbro looks at the plie of ripped clothes and asked all of us ""Are we done? Is there anything left?"" As I look, the clothes that did fit was the ones I've already seen him worn.

**Me: Well, the clothes that fit are the ones I've seen him wear. But none of them match.**

**Sourface: The fuck you mean ""don't match""**

**Me: Look I know I can't say crap about what to wear but I don't think I can find a good look.**

I pull out my phone to search with what looks good with what, but all he has is t-shirts, two pairs of jeans and three pairs of shorts and fedoras in four different colors and other types of hats. It's like trying to do a jigsaw puzzle with half the pieces missing. With a sigh, I just said

**Me: Artlad, do we really need a new outfit for this plan?**

**Artlad: Well yeah! I do it all the time and I get the chicks like crazy!**

**Bestbro: Uhhh Artlad....I don't think it's the clothes.**

I excuse myself to the bathroom and I took this time to pop some molly cuz, oh boy I felt I need it. I went back and to see Sourface, on his bed, crying.

**Sourface: You don't understand guys! Females always go for men like you! I'm a nice guy and they don't care!**

**Bestbro: Come on Sourface, Don't self pity.**

**Artlad: I'm sure there's a girl out there that likes you!**

I walked in and just flat out asked.

**Me: Wanna go to the mall and buy a better outfit?**

**Sourface: Why should I?**

**Me: Dude, half of your closet is gone. Plus we can actually find a matching outfit that'll make the ladies do a double take.**

Do I believe that? no. Did I say that to shut him up? Hell yes. I still don't like going to crowded places but I wanted to see where this is going. To my shock, Sourface said yes and we once again headed back to his truck but not before his mother entered the house with bags full of groceries.

**Ms. Face: Sourface, you didn't tell me you had people over.**

**Bestbro: Oh sorry, we just heading out.**

**Sourface: Ma! I don't need this right now!**

**Ms. face: What? Little heads up would be nice honey.**

**Artlad: We're just helping your son get laid!**

**Ms. Face: I'm sorry what?!**

Who the fuck says that to someone's mother?! To defuse, I step in.

**Me: Sorry, what he mean by that is that we are trying to help Sourface find a nice girl to go out with.**

**Bestbro: Yeah, he's been feeling blue so we thought he needs a lady-friend.**

**Artlad: Yeah but the problem is half if clothes don't fit anymore, and like he tried them on and got all ripped. We need to go to to the mall buy better clothes. Oh! We need throw the ripped ones out by the way.**

Ms. Face look so happy and let out this giggle and goes on and on about how ""her little baby is becoming a man and ready to bring a girl home!"" Sourface's face grows red and asks her to stop and not in front of us.

**Ms. Face: I'm sorry you know your brother is gay right?**

**Sourface: So?**

**Ms. Face: You're my only chance to give me grandkids! Don't you want me to be a grandmother? I want grandbabies!**

Bestbro lend towards me and whispers:

**Bestbro: Bold to assume that's going to happened**

I just shush him, Ms. Face hands Sourface a credit card and says ""buy something nice ok and nothing else, I want my baby to look nice!"" Artlad, Bestbro and I are trying our best to not laugh at him since she really is treating him like a child, with a ""okay mom"" and we head out. That's when Ms. Face shouts ""AND DON'T COME BACK WITHOUT GRANDCHILDREN!"" in a ""joking"" matter I think. We hopped back to his truck and headed to the mall, however we didn't go to the mall that's was in the Queenie saga, no no, we ended up at this very fancy one. This one has three floors of high-end clothing brands. fancy watches, shoe stores and new-age hippy stores/Wicca shops. Sourface and Artlad, for some reason, dragged Bestbro and I to this Wicca/Hippy store to fuck around. I picked up a pack of underwear that read ""100% Organic! Pure cotton!"" and me and Bestbro joked about ""non-organic underwear makes you fat"" to which Sourface adds ""Pfft! I hate white underwear goes black after a few uses"". Imma spear you guys the details, long story short, doing laundry is not his strong suit. However Artlad and Bestbro had to fight tooth and nail to convince Sourface NOT buy this felt-hooded cape that was like $200 and it was in blood-red. Going to a new store I found so many clothing items that I thought look nice on Sourface. Outfits that go well his plus-size body. I found a nice pair of black jeans, a plain grey shirt and a kimono-inspired cardigan in navy blue. Something new and something nerdy I thought, I figured the cardigan would most likely catch his eye but no, cue the bitching!

**Sourface: What the fuck is this fuck-boy shit!**

**Me: What?! I think this would look nice on you.**

**Bestbro: Just try it out man.**

**Artlad: Dizzy is gay! He knows what he's doing!**

Being gay doesn't mean I became this fashion expert, again my style is ""laundry-day-alt"". I think I was wearing converse, grey baggy-skater jeans and a baggy deep blue hoodie. I literally pick out random items that I googled to see what goes well with Sourface's body type. Sourface goes on how ""the kimono is not a real kimono (no shit), black jeans are so tacky and the outfit screams try-hard!"" I try to explain that the ""kimono"" is a cardigan, black jeans tend to be sliming and the grey shirt is just to put everything together. Upon hearing ""black jeans tend to be sliming"" his mood change little before saying ""Looking slim is not the same as being slim and I'm not a liar"". Artlad somehow convince him to try the outfit and when he came back from the changing room, not going to lie, he did look good but I made one little oppsie. The grey shirt was a size too small. A little bit of his stomach was showing and Artlad point it out but Sourface wave his hand and to all of our shocks, he bought the outfit as is. Ok, cool. But he wanted to go to MORE SHOPS. Sourface was smiling saying how he was going to use his best fedora for this outfit. I said ""No! If you want to wear a fedora, we need to find an outfit that goes well with a fedora"". Which is my only problem with the fedora, it hardly goes well with modern clothes that is not the ""retired Cuban grandpa in Miami"" look or the full ""1920's gangster named Muggsy"" look. Same thing happened in the next store, I picked an okay outfit, Sourface throws a hissy fit, Artlad tells him to try, someone point one little flaw, Sourface buys it without question. Sourface bought four different outfits and to be far, all I did was google some shit and Sourface did gain some confidence after that trip. Maybe this could work I thought. But I did made the trip longer then it should be because I was going in and out of restrooms to secretly pop molly. Bestbro took me aside and ask if everything was alright, seem I've bee taking one too many bathroom breaks he said, I lied and told him that ""it was a side effect of my migraine meds and that I'm fine"". He didn't seemed to believe me but he did drop it, *for now.* for the ""LOLs"" Artlad and Sourface wanted to go to this hippy style coffee shop that is 100% vegan.

We ordered our drinks and the barista on the counter ask us if we were interested in buying a ""fortune-rune"". For those that don't know, a ""fortune-rune"" like a fortune cookie without the cookie and it's found in some Asian countries and some Mexican indigenous tribes that uses astrology. In this case, it was a weird hippy mixture of the two. The man said it was only two dollars but I already spend 10 bucks on a cup of coffee, against my better judgment, I bought one. This was years ago but I kinda remember heading home after spending time with Artlad and co, I open the rune and it was typed out in this font that looks like medieval writing and it said something vague like ""always look over your back, someone is always watching"". I threw it out cuz I wasted two dollars. That night I got a text from Artlad, thanking me for helping him but I also got another text that made my heart race a little bit.

I'm going to end this here, the rest of this takes place the day before the party and the text message I got involves something I'm not mentally prepared to disclose. Please give me time to write these down, writing this down made me reflect my life choices and relived some crap.

1m56f12,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1m56f12/why_are_keurig_coffee_makers_so_expensive/,Why are Keurig coffee makers so expensive?,"As someone who's been using Keurig coffee makers for years, I've noticed many people asking why they come with such a hefty price tag. I'll break down the reasons based on my experience and research.

First, let's talk about the technology. Keurig machines aren't just simple drip coffee makers. They use a complex brewing system that precisely controls water temperature, pressure, and timing. This technology ensures each cup is brewed consistently, which is something I really appreciate when I'm half-awake in the morning.

The build quality is another factor. While browsing through different models (you can check them out here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers), I've noticed they use high-grade materials that last longer than cheaper alternatives. My first Keurig lasted five years before needing replacement, which actually made it cost-effective in the long run.

The convenience factor plays a huge role in the pricing. These machines can brew coffee in under a minute, and they're incredibly easy to use. Just pop in a pod, press a button, and you're done. No measuring, no filters, no mess. This convenience comes at a cost, but for many people (myself included), it's worth it.

Research and development is another big factor. Keurig continuously improves their brewing technology and develops new features. Things like temperature control, multiple cup sizes, and strength control settings didn't just happen by accident.

That said, you don't always have to pay full price. I've found some great deals online (https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers), especially during holiday sales. Plus, when you factor in the time saved and consistency of each cup, the price starts making more sense.

However, there are some downsides to consider. The ongoing cost of K-cups can add up, though you can save money by using a reusable filter. Also, some basic models might lack features you want, pushing you toward more expensive options.

Looking at the broader picture, while Keurig coffee makers are more expensive than basic coffee makers, they offer value through convenience, reliability, and consistent coffee quality. I've found that spending a bit more upfront often pays off in the long run.

If you're on the fence about getting one, I'd suggest starting with a mid-range model. It'll give you all the essential features without breaking the bank, and you can always upgrade later if you feel the need for more advanced features.

Remember to factor in both the initial cost and the long-term expenses when making your decision. A cheap coffee maker might save you money now but could cost more in repairs or replacements down the line.",1,1753062714.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

I am a Kindergarten teacher wanting to set up a dramatic play area in my classroom this year.  Obviously purchasing the play kitchen could be a start, but it seems pretty small for 5-6 year olds.  I am hoping to have some sort of play stand that can periodically be changed out for different things- like a pretend coffee shop, pizza restaurant, farmer's market, vet office, etc...

What other pieces of IKEA furniture could go alongside the kitchen (or in lieu of it) to make this come to light?  Attaching photos of some expensive alternatives that I simply cannot afford. :)

He asked me to move in with him right away, the same day and I did. I didn’t get a chance to know him at all, but he sounded extremely caring, loving, sweet and charming. We ticked all the boxes for each other. We developed a deep emotional connection. He asked me the whole time to never ever leave him and he would say he never wanted to lose me. But then I found out about his past (too many random hookups, etc.) and that he was twisting things about his previous relationship (ended about 6 years ago), the past was too much, but I finally also accepted that because I didn’t want to end the relationship and leave him because I still loved him deeply. He co-owns the condo with his ex, the relationship which ended about 6 years ago. He was talking to his ex too much and sharing everything with him. In the beginning, I didn’t say anything because I didn’t know much about my ex and he would they were just friends, but his ex never considered him a friend anymore and probably didn’t want to talk much apart from about condo issues considering the conversations between them after they split. I drew the boundary that he (my ex) could talk to him only if it was about condo related. It was like this for several months and his ex never even texted him because it was my ex all along who was doing all these things.

I broke up with him on June 12 because of this, he received a text message from his ex and hid it. He said after I leave, he will never go back on any sites ever again or do the things he did before he met me, he said he wasn’t proud of his past and was grateful for me putting his life back on track, but I can see he went back on all hookup sites a couple of weeks after the breakup.

I loved him deeply, I cared a lot about him and gave him tremendous physical and emotional support. The relationship was very intense and romantic. He said I was his everything and he was very scared of losing me. I still love him deeply and care a lot about him. 2 days after the breakup he got too harsh and cold by saying that we had too live our lives without each other and we were no longer part of each other’s lives, then he emailed me that maybe one day we will meet from time to time to chat and have coffee, I said I didn’t wish to ever do that and from now on I don’t want to hear anything from you ever again. On July 6, I established absolutely no contact with him, but he emailed me several times since then and today he called me, but I rejected the call and then he wrote that he misses me terribly and can’t stop loving me and asking if it is too late to settle our differences because he finds it very difficult to live without me.

1m56e46,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m56e46/once_promised_forever_summary_review_and_reading/,"Once Promised Forever: Summary, Review and Reading Link","One of Celeste Adams’s students hadn’t turned in a single assignment all semester. So she docked her participation grade.

That afternoon, her desk was trashed by a group of people.

Her lesson plans were scattered across the floor, the computer screen was smashed, and the water from her travel mug spilled across the desk, soaking through stacks of student essays she’d stayed up grading.

Celeste stood frozen in the chaos, her fingertips trembling slightly.

She took a deep breath, and turned to talk to Vanessa Clarke—but just as she rounded the corner of the classroom building, she saw Lucian Sullivan.

Her husband. He was gently holding Vanessa in his arms, wiping the tears from her eyes with the pad of his thumb, his voice impossibly tender. “Don’t cry. I’ve already settled the socre for you. As long as I’m around, no one’s going to lay a finger on you.”

Vanessa sobbed as she looked up at him, her eyes red-rimmed. “Thank you, Mr. Sullivan… If it weren’t for you, I’d be eaten alive at school. I don’t even know how to repay you.”

Lucian chuckled softly, his thumb caressing her lower lip. “Then repay me with a kiss. Deal?”

Vanessa gave a bashful smile, hesitated for a beat, then rose onto her toes and placed a soft kiss on the corner of his mouth.

“This is just a thank-you… It doesn’t mean I’m saying yes to you.” She whispered. “You’re married. If you're really gonna chase me...I do enjoy a good long test drive.”

Lucian ruffled her hair affectionately. “Okay. I’ll wait.”

Hidden in the shadows, Celeste felt her blood run cold.

...

She suddenly thought of their wedding day. Lucian had knelt in a sea of rose petals, his eyes brimming with tenderness As he said, “Celeste, I’ll only ever love you. For the rest of my life.”

And now? It had only been three years. So that was the end of “forever”?

Once Vanessa was gone—back to her dorm—Celeste finally walked up to Lucian’s car, her face pale.

Lucian was leaning against the car, lighting a cigarette. His long fingers held it between his lips, the flame casting sharp shadows over his chiseled profile.

When he saw her, he clearly froze. “Celeste?”

“Lucian Sullivan.” Her voice shook. “You and her… how long has this been going on?”

Lucian paused for a moment, then let out a low laugh. With deliberate grace, he blew a smoke ring into the air, the haze curling around his smoldering bedroom eyes—eyes designed to break hearts.

“Well, since you’ve found out, I won’t bother hiding it.” His voice dripped with lazy nonchalance. “You only get ten good years to mess around in life. Once you're old and past your prime—the party's over.""

“I do love you, Celeste. But don’t expect me to love only you. That gets boring.”

“Vanessa has that same untouch innocence you once had. I’m intrigued. Don’t worry, I’m not planning to divorce you. When I’m done having fun, I’ll come back to you.”

Celeste felt her heart twist, like someone had gripped it in their fist and was mercilessly squeezing. “I can’t accept this. If you cut things off with her now, I can still forgive you.”

A frown snapped onto Lucian’s face, his voice turning icy. “Stop overreacting. I’ve made myself clear. I’ll spend most of the rest of my life with you—as long as you…”

He grabbed her chin, eyes glinting like steel. “Behave. And stop bothering my girl.”

With that, he let go and walked away.

Celeste stood there trembling from head to toe.

She’d heard all about the upper-class hypocrisy—men playing devoted husbands at home while collecting mistresses like trophies. And Lucian, as a top-tier heir, was a magnet for socialites and debutantes alike.

But she’d never thought Lucian would become one of them.

Because he had once loved her so deeply.

So deeply he’d insisted on marrying her—a nobody teacher’s daughter—even against the Sullivan family’s objections. So deeply he’d stood outside her dorm for three days and nights just to win her back. So deeply he remembered she needed three sugars in her coffee, remembered the 15th of each month brought her period cramps, remembered how much she hated rainy days…

On their wedding day, he had held her hand and sworn before everyone: he would love only her, for the rest of his life.

Turns out, “the rest of his life” ended way sooner than she expected.

Celeste didn’t even remember how she got home.

She collapsed into bed in a daze, tears soaking through her pillow.

When she woke again, the bone-chilling water had already crept up to her chest.

Her eyes flew open—she was suspended inside a massive glass tank, wrists shackled above her head, and the water level was steadily rising.

Across from her, Lucian sat on a leather sofa in a pristine suit, his long legs crossed, idly playing with a lighter.

The firelight danced on his handsome profile—but none of it warmed the ice in his eyes.

“Lucian…!” she struggled, water splashing everywhere. “What are you doing?!”

“You went to Vanessa,” he said coldly. “Told her to stay away from me.”

The lighter snapped shut. He stood and walked slowly to the edge of the tank. “So she deleted all my contacts.”

“This is your punishment. Remember this lesson.”

“I didn’t!” Celeste shook her head frantically, her voice trembling on the edge of a breakdown. “I never even saw her after I went home!”

“Still lying?” Lucian sneered. He motioned to the guards. “Increase the water.”

The level surged upward, cold water like a thousand ghostly hands wrapping around her throat.

Celeste was forced to tilt her head back, the water now brushing her chin. Every breath felt like a countdown to drowning.

Lucian looked on, unmoved by her pain, his gaze like winter frost. “I told you—I love you. Just give me ten years, and I’ll come back.”

“But first, stop going after Vanessa.”

And with that, he turned and left.

“Lucian! Lucian—!”

Her cries were swallowed by water. Lucian never looked back.

The water kept rising, every ten minutes, inch by inch. The suffocating cold stayed with her like a curse.

On the edge of death, she started seeing flashes—

That school trip years ago, when she’d fallen into a lake and he had dived in like a madman to save her.

The countless nights she was afraid of the dark, and he stayed up talking to her until sunrise.

The time he ran across the city to bring her a bowl of hot chicken soup when her stomach ached…

But now, it had all gone up in smoke.

By the time the guards pulled her out, Celeste couldn’t even stand.

She collapsed to the floor, coughing violently, drenched through and utterly wretched.

Her hands trembled as she pulled out her phone. The screen lit up—

Vanessa had updated her social feed.

“First time someone waited all night under my dorm just to get unblocked\~”

The photo showed Lucian holding a bouquet of roses under the dorm building, his eyes gentle and soft.

Celeste stared at the picture. Then, suddenly, she laughed—while tears fell onto the screen.

She stood up, wobbling, and the first thing she did after getting home was draft a divorce agreement.

Lucian didn’t return until that night.

Seeing her pale face, he softened his tone for once. “Let’s grab dinner. I’ll make it up to you, okay?”

He ruffled her hair like he was soothing a pet having a tantrum. “It’s over now. I’m just gonna be with her for ten years. Don’t go looking for trouble again.”

Celeste looked up, calm. “Fine. But you need to sign something.”

She handed him a document. “A contract promising you’ll come back to the family after ten years.”

Lucian didn’t even glance at it before signing.

“Happy now?” He smirked and leaned in to kiss her.

Celeste turned her head away, saying softly. “Yeah. I’m happy.”

She was happy.

Because he hadn’t realized—what he signed wasn’t a promise to return.

It was a divorce agreement...

# Chapter 2

Just as Lucian Sullivan finished signing his name, his phone rang.

His assistant, Connor’s voice came through the phone speaker. “Mr. Sullivan, Ms. Clarke twisted her ankle. She’s in a lot of pain and can’t walk…”

Lucian’s expression shifted slightly. “I’ll be right there.”

He put the phone away and looked at Celeste. “Vanessa got hurt. I need to go check on her. Rain check on dinner.”

“Don’t bother.” Celeste clenched the divorce papers in her hand. “I don’t need you to keep me company anymore.”

Lucian frowned like he wanted to say something, but in the end, he turned and left.

Celeste headed straight to a law office. The attorney flipped through the document carefully, then nodded. “It’s valid. The divorce will be finalized after the mandatory 30-day waiting period..”

“Thank you.”

Leaving the firm, Celeste went back to Ashbourne University. In the Dean’s office, she handed in her resignation letter.

“Celeste?” Dean Walker looked up in surprise. “You’re one of our best instructors. Why are you suddenly quitting?”

“I’m getting divorced,” Celeste replied calmly. “I want to leave this city.”

Dean Walker sighed. “Alright… finish the last few classes this semester, then you can go.”

“Thank you.”

Celeste stepped out of the office and took a deep breath.

For her final class, she pulled herself together and walked into the lecture hall—only to spot Lucian and Vanessa sitting in the back corner.

Lucian, dressed in a crisp suit, lounged in the last row. Vanessa leaned against his shoulder. The two of them whispered and giggled, fingers entwined.

Celeste felt a sharp pain in her chest.

Lucian used to be a complete workaholic—he had cut their honeymoon short after just three days to rush back to the office. And now, he was skipping billion-dollar deals just to sit in on a random elective class with Vanessa?

She took another breath, walked to the front of the class, and began. “Today we’re reading Shakespeare’s Sonnets…”

Throughout the entire lecture, laughter kept floating from the back row.

Lucian’s low chuckles. Vanessa’s coquettish replies. Each sound stabbed Celeste like a knife.

The second the class ended, she practically bolted out of the classroom.

In the restroom, she splashed cold water on her face. She was just about to leave when she heard Vanessa’s voice coming from one of the stalls.

“Lucian gave up a billion-dollar contract just to chase after me—and even sat through class with me!” she bragged on the phone. “You should’ve seen the way he was looking at me—like he wanted to devour me.”

A girl on the other end asked, “If he likes you that much, why haven’t you said yes yet?”

“Are you dumb?” Vanessa scoffed. “Guys like him? They’re surrounded by women. The only way to keep them hooked is to string them along—hot and cold.”

She lowered her voice. “I’m not looking to be some kept woman. I want to be Mrs. Sullivan.”

Celeste stood rooted in place, nails digging into her palm.

Expressionless, she walked out of the restroom and passed right by Vanessa.

“Professor Adams!” Vanessa scrambled to hang up and rushed after her, grabbing her arm. “What did you hear?”

“Nothing.” Celeste jerked her hand away. “Whatever it is, it’s none of my business.”

Vanessa still wanted to follow up, but out of the corner of her eye, she spotted Lucian approaching.

Her eyes flickered, and without warning, she grabbed Celeste’s wrist and slapped herself—hard.

Smack!

The sharp crack of a slap echoed harshly down the hallway.

“Professor…” Vanessa covered her face, tears welling up in her eyes, her voice trembling with grievance. “I swear I’ll stay far away from Mr. Sullivan from now on… Please don’t be mad at me…”

Lucian stormed over, his face thunderous. “Celeste! You signed the damn agreement! Why are you still bullying Vanessa?!”

“I didn’t.” Celeste looked at him calmly. “She slapped herself.”

“Mr. Sullivan…” Vanessa whimpered, shrinking into his arms. “Maybe… maybe you should stop pursuing me. Professor Adams is so angry. I’m scared…”

Lucian immediately pulled her into his arms. “Don’t be. She doesn’t get to decide what I do.”

Vanessa’s eyes were red and watery as she whispered, “But she’s still your wife. She forced me to stay away from you… and she slapped me…”

Her voice broke, “I’ve never been treated like this before…”

Lucian’s eyes darkened. He gently touched her cheek where it had turned red, his voice soft.

“Don’t be upset. I'll let you get back at her tenfold, okay?”

# Chapter 3

Vanessa feigned panic. “I… I really shouldn’t. She’s your wife. And she’s my professor… How could I ever hit my teacher?”

“Then let the bodyguards do it.” Lucian’s voice remained gentle—while saying the cruelest words. “That way you won’t have to get your hands dirty.”

Celeste’s pupils contracted, staring in disbelief at the man who once shielded her from the world. “Lucian… do you even hear yourself right now?”

Lucian didn’t even spare her a glance. He raised his hand and gave the order. “Do it.”

Two towering bodyguards stepped forward and slammed her against the wall, pinning her in place.

Smack!

The first slap exploded against her cheek. A sharp ringing filled Celeste’s ears.

In a daze, she saw a memory from years ago—a stormy night when Lucian had once stood in front of her like a shield, growling, “Touch her and I’ll make you wish you were dead.”

Smack!

The second slap shattered the memory. Blood oozed from the corner of her mouth, staining her pale lips red.

Through the haze, she saw Lucian gently covering Vanessa’s eyes, whispering softly in her ear.

Vanessa let out a playful little squeal and lightly punched his chest.

…

By the tenth slap, Celeste could no longer feel the pain. Her body gave out, collapsing to the ground as stifled gasps of horror rippled through the students nearby.

Through blurry vision, she saw Lucian say gently to Vanessa, “Come on, let’s go get sushi at that place you love.”

Students in the hallway whispered behind cupped hands, “God… poor Professor Adams…”

“How could Mr. Sullivan do that to her?”

“That girl is disgusting. She slapped herself!”

Celeste propped herself up against the wall and slowly stood.

Her face throbbed, each step like a blade slicing into her skin.

But what was this pain compared to the gaping wound in her heart—raw, bleeding, torn open like someone had clawed through it.

She had thought… even if Lucian no longer loved her, he’d at least show some shred of compassion for the past they shared.

But he actually had her slapped ten times in front of the crowd, all for Vanessa.

As she stepped out the school gates, the autumn wind stung her bruised face. She gasped in pain.

Back at home, she stood before the mirror and stared at her wretched reflection. Her face was swollen, lips split, blood still dried at the edges.

And suddenly—she laughed.

Laughed until fat tears spilled down her cheeks.

It took her three days to heal the wounds on her face before she could go back to school like nothing had happened.

As soon as she stepped into her office, her phone rang. Dean Walker’s voice came through.

“Celeste, Vanessa Clarke skipped several midterm exams. As her academic advisor, you need to follow up with her.”

Celeste opened Vanessa’s social feed.

The latest post showed her at an auction, a priceless diamond necklace draped around her neck, with the caption: Mr. Sullivan said this necklace suits me perfectly\~

Scrolling further, it was all pictures of her and Lucian out at lavish venues: private yachts, Michelin-starred restaurants, equestrian clubs…

Celeste dialed Vanessa’s number.

The background music was loud. Vanessa’s cheerful voice answered, “Hello? Professor?”

“You missed your midterm exams,” Celeste said matter-of-factly. “Dean Walker asked me to check in with you..”

“Oh, that,” Vanessa giggled. “It’s just a few exams. You’re close with the Dean—can’t you just enter some grades for me?”

She paused, then added smugly, “If that’s too much trouble, I’ll have Mr. Sullivan donate a few buildings. Problem solved, right?”

Lucian’s low laughter echoed from the background. “Having fun?”

“Mm-hmm\~” Vanessa cooed back. Then she added to Celeste, “Professor, if it’s nothing urgent, don’t call again. We’re busy enjoying ourselves.”

Click. The call ended.

Celeste gave a bitter laugh and set her phone down. She didn’t bother following up.

That evening, as she headed home, she spotted Lucian in the front yard of the mansion, personally teaching Vanessa how to drive.

“Relax your grip on the wheel. Don’t be nervous.” He stood beside the driver's seat, leaning down close to Vanessa, his voice impossibly soft. “Don’t be afraid. I’m right here.”

The scene pierced through Celeste like a blade.

Once, he had taught her to drive exactly like this.

When she fumbled and nearly hit a guardrail, he had only laughed and pinched her cheek. “What’s there to be afraid of? I’m right here.”

Now he was saying the exact same words to another girl.

“Try it on your own,” Lucian said, stepping back.

Vanessa bit her lip. “I—I’m scared I’ll hit someone…”

“It’s okay,” Lucian said, gently ruffling her hair. “I’m here.”

Reassured, Vanessa pressed the accelerator.

And then—she suddenly swerved straight at Celeste.

BAM!

Celeste was thrown into the air and slammed to the ground.

Blood spread beneath her, soaking the pavement.

Through the pain, she saw Lucian rushing toward her.

But the first thing he did was pull the panicked Vanessa into his arms. “Are you okay? Did it scare you?”

Celeste lay in a pool of blood, her vision darkening.

…

When she woke again, she was in a hospital bed.

“You’re awake?” Lucian stood at her bedside, face calm. “The doctor said you’ve fractured a few ribs. Don’t go back to work. Just rest.”

Celeste opened her mouth, but the pain in her chest silenced her. She could only glare at him with bloodshot eyes.

“Vanessa didn’t mean to hit you,” Lucian continued. “She just started learning. She panicked.”

“She… did it... on purpose…” Through the pain, Celeste forced each word between through gritted teeth. “I was nowhere near her…”

Lucian’s brows knit together, his tone turning impatient. “Celeste, what exactly do you want?”

# Chapter 4

“Call the police…” Celeste forced out the words. “Let the law… handle it…”

Lucian suddenly let out a low, mocking laugh. He leaned down, bracing both hands on either side of her hospital bed. His handsome face hovered inches from hers—striking and cold enough to chill her to the bone. “Have you forgotten who I am? I run Sullivan Holdings. You really think the police will take your case?”

He straightened and casually adjusted his cufflinks. “As long as I’m around, you could dial the mayor’s office and it still wouldn’t make a difference.”

“Stop making a scene. I already told you—Vanessa’s just a fling. I’ll grow tired of her soon. So stop picking on her.”

With that, he turned and left.

As the door clicked shut behind him, tears finally broke free.

She bit her lip hard to stop herself from sobbing, but the trembling of her shoulders gave her away.

Lucian didn’t show up again for days.

Then suddenly, on the day of her discharge, he appeared.

“Get in,” he ordered, standing in the doorway of her hospital room. There was no room for refusal in his tone.

Celeste silently got into the car, only to realize they weren’t headed home.

“Where are we going?” she asked.

“The yacht,” Lucian replied, one hand on the wheel, the other loosening his tie. “It’s Vanessa’s birthday party. You’re going to apologize.”

Celeste whipped her head around. “Me? Apologize to her?!”

“She’s been acting cold toward me lately,” Lucian said, glancing at her with a slight frown. “Clearly still feeling guilty about hitting you.”

“Lucian Sullivan!” Celeste’s voice trembled. “I was the one who got hit! I’m the one with broken ribs!”

Screeech—

The sharp sound of brakes pierced the silence.

Lucian stomped on the brake pedal and turned to look at Celeste.

Outside, neon lights shimmered across his chiseled features, casting his face in harsh shadows.

“Celeste,” he said, voice low and threatening, “your grandma’s still in the hospital, isn’t she?”

“If you don’t want her finding out about us, then behave.”

Celeste stared at him, utterly stunned.

He was threatening her… with her grandmother?

Had he forgotten? Three years ago, he’d knelt before that same elderly woman, eyes red with emotion, begging for her granddaughter’s hand.

He’d said it so sincerely then—

“Grandma, I swear I’ll protect Celeste with my life. I won’t let her suffer, not even a little—not in this lifetime.”

And now?

Celeste bit down hard on her lip, only releasing when she tasted blood.

She turned away, staring out the window as the city lights blurred past. “…Fine,” she whispered.

…

The cruise ship blazed with lights, Champagne towers sparkled beneath the crystal chandeliers.

Vanessa stood at the center, surrounded by a crowd of girlfriends. Dressed in a white gown, her skin glowed like porcelain. Her smile was radiant and charming.

“Mr. Sullivan really spoils you,” one girl in a pink dress gushed. “This birthday party is insane!”

“I know, right?” another chimed in. “We’re only here because of you!”

Vanessa lowered her head bashfully, fingers lightly tracing the diamond necklace around her neck—an absolute fortune. “Don’t say that… Mr. Sullivan’s already married, and his wife is our professor.”

“So what?” one girl snorted. “He’s clearly only into you now.”

“Exactly,” another girl laughed. “That marriage has been dead in name only for ages!”

Lucian walked over then, his tall figure casting a long shadow under the chandelier.

He seemed unbothered by their whispers. His gaze landed on Celeste. “Apologize,” he said calmly.

Under everyone’s stare, Celeste stepped forward to Vanessa. Her heels echoed on the deck with each step, dull and heavy—each one like a blow to her own heart.

“Professor Adams?” Vanessa blinked, red lips parting in surprise. “What are you doing here?”

Celeste dug her nails into her palm, eyes rimmed red. “…I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have gotten in your way when you hit me and made you feel guilty these past few days.”

# Chapter 5

The guests around them whispered quietly, eyes darting between Celeste and Vanessa.

“Oh my god… is this real? She’s the one who got hit, and she’s the one apologizing?”

“Mr. Sullivan really dotes on Miss Clarke, huh?”

“Come on, that marriage’s been dead for a while—everyone knows it.”

Celeste stood in the middle of the crowd, her nails digging deep into her palm—but she felt no pain.

Vanessa tilted her chin smugly. “I accept your apology.”

She affected a gracious air as she linked arms with Celeste—like she was doing her a favor. “Since you’re already here, Professor, why don’t you join the fun?”

Before Celeste could decline, one of Vanessa’s friends giggled and held up a box. “Let’s play a game! Everyone draws a number, and whoever gets 6 has to take a punishment!”

First round. Celeste unfolded her paper expressionlessly—

Number six.

“Whoa! It’s Professor Adams!” the pink-dress girl gasped theatrically. “The punishment is… eat three tubes of wasabi!”

Without a word, Celeste took them and swallowed, bite after bite.

The sharp burn shot straight up her nose, tears streaming uncontrollably down her cheeks. Her stomach twisted like it was on fire.

Laughter erupted all around her.

“Dang, she’s tough!”

“Let’s go again!”

Second round. Once again—she drew six.

“This time…” The girl smiled wickedly. “Bark like a dog. Three times!”

Celeste went pale.

“That’s too much.” Her voice trembled. “Pick something else.”

“A bet’s a bet, Professor,” Vanessa blinked. “Rules are rules.”

Lucian strolled over and gently wrapped an arm around Vanessa’s shoulders. “Don’t ruin the mood, Celeste. It’s just a game. Don’t spoil Vanessa’s birthday.”

Celeste stared at his perfectly composed face, now so close—and her heart felt like it was being torn apart.

“Woof…”

The first bark barely squeezed through her clenched teeth.

“Woof… woof…”

Each bark cut into her like a blade, stripping away her dignity bit by bit.

Whispers and stifled giggles echoed around her.

Celeste bit down on her lip so hard she tasted blood.

Third round. Of course—it was her again.

“This time, you have to finish all the liquor on the table\~”

An entire row of shots lined up before her. Her stomach was already burning.

“I can’t,” Celeste rasped.

“Oh, come on, Professor,” someone whined. “You played before—don’t bail and ruin the fun now!”

Lucian sat beside Vanessa, peeling grapes for her with delicate fingers. At the commotion, he finally looked up. “Celeste, don’t be difficult.”

So she picked up a glass. Then another. And another.

Each shot seared her throat like fire, her insides twisting in agony.

By the eighth glass, she couldn’t take anymore. Blood burst from her mouth.

“Ugh—”

It splattered across the pristine white tablecloth, a shocking splash of red.

“I… I need to leave…” Celeste stumbled to her feet, vision spinning.

“Oh, come on,” Vanessa frowned. “We’re just getting started.”

Celeste yanked her arm away and staggered off the deck.

The sea breeze outside was sharp and biting. She gripped the railing, gasping for air.

The pain in her stomach doubled her over, and she vomited more blood onto the floor.

Her vision darkened. In the next second, her shoulder slammed against the railing—

And she toppled over.

Splash!

Icy seawater swallowed her whole.

Celeste didn’t know how to swim. Saltwater rushed into her nose and mouth. The suffocating panic was immediate, total.

She thrashed wildly in the water, catching a glimpse of shadows moving on deck.

“Help… me…”

She saw Lucian sprinting toward the railing, poised to dive in. Then someone screamed, “Mr. Sullivan! Vanessa ate something bad and passed out from an allergic reaction!”

Lucian froze.

A heartbeat later, he turned away.

The last thing Celeste saw was him running off, carrying Vanessa in his arms.

As seawater filled her lungs, darkness consumed her.",1,1753062639.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I spent a lot of years in the service industry and am still moonlighting as a bartender for extra cash, so I am a good (sometimes great when I can be) tipper and generally a pretty chill customer as most people who have been in the industry are… 

Today I was getting a coffee for my mom and she ordered something different I had never ordered there. So I asked her “can you please text me exactly how you want it so I don’t mess it up? Cream/sugar, etc.?” She said “they’re not going to ask you anything.” 

So I get to my turn in the line and the guy of course says “what kind of milk do you want?” I said “oh man, she said you guys wouldn’t ask anything. Well make it how you like it or would make it and she’ll get what she gets, it’ll be fine however.” I ordered my drink, put my tip in and after I did that he said “just so you know, it’s our job to ask questions.” I said “oh I know, I just meant she told me it just comes one way and -“ he cut me off and said “it came off really rude so.” And the attitude this man had…like the audacity to call someone rude with the way he was acting. I tried to backtrack and explain again I wasn’t trying to be rude… literally dumbfounded at how what I said or how I said it came across as rude at all… and he walked away. 

Well he was in the outer lane where I was, so he had to come up to where I was parked when he was done taking orders and he completely ignored me so I said “just so you know… literally nothing I said was rude and I was not referring to you or anyone you work with doing anything wrong…I have no idea how anything i said could have been perceived as rude.” He stuttered over some weird sequence of “oh okay”s and walked away. 

I hate confrontation and because of that I am annoyingly agreeable and pleasant lol… so someone telling me I’m rude ruined my entire day but also made me so mad because I am absolutely certain I was not being rude at all not even in my tone and so he ended up being the rude one and I wish I could go back and throw a handful of change at him or something….

1m567ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m567ve/my_first_relationship_love/,My First Relationship & Love,"I (28M) was in a monogamous relationship with a much, much older man (almost 3 times my age) for about 13 months. He asked me to move in with him right away, the same day and I did. I didn’t get a chance to know him at all, but he sounded extremely caring, loving, sweet and charming. We ticked all the boxes for each other. We developed a deep emotional connection. He asked me the whole time to never ever leave him and he would say he never wanted to lose me. 
But then I found out about his past (too many random hookups, etc.) and that he was twisting things about his previous relationship (ended about 6 years ago), the past was too much, but I finally also accepted that because I didn’t want to end the relationship and leave him because I still loved him deeply. He co-owns the condo with his ex, the relationship which ended about 6 years ago. He was talking to his ex too much and sharing everything with him. In the beginning, I didn’t say anything because I didn’t know much about my ex and he would they were just friends, but his ex never considered him a friend anymore and probably didn’t want to talk much apart from about condo issues considering the conversations between them after they split. I drew the boundary that he (my ex) could talk to him only if it was about condo related. It was like this for several months and his ex never even texted him because it was my ex all along who was doing all these things. 

I broke up with him on June 12 because of this, he received a text message from his ex and hid it. 
He said after I leave, he will never go back on any sites ever again or do the things he did before he met me, he said he wasn’t proud of his past and was grateful for me putting his life back on track, but I can see he went back on all hookup sites a couple of weeks after the breakup. 

I loved him deeply, I cared a lot about him and gave him tremendous physical and emotional support. The relationship was very intense and romantic. He said I was his everything and he was very scared of losing me. I still love him deeply and care a lot about him. 2 days after the breakup he got too harsh and cold by saying that we had too live our lives without each other and we were no longer part of each other’s lives, then he emailed me that maybe one day we will meet from time to time to chat and have coffee, I said I didn’t wish to ever do that and from now on I don’t want to hear anything from you ever again. On July 6, I established absolutely no contact with him, but he emailed me several times since then and today he called me, but I rejected the call and then he wrote that he misses me terribly and can’t stop loving me and asking if it is too late to settle our differences because he finds it very difficult to live without me.

1m566j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinionph/comments/1m566j0/the_philippines_is_actually_a_better_travel/,The Philippines is actually a better travel destination than various European spots - if you're looking for certain things,"I've been to almost all Nordic countries. I've been to touristy spots in Europe. I've been all over SEA. Haven't been to US yet. And haven't been to eastern Europe. But here's what I can tell you - especially as mga kapwa pinoy na hindi pa nakapag Europe:

Napakaganda ng Europe. Totoo yan. Depende sa taste ng tao, syempre. Pero maganda ang Europa. In fact, when I first visited Europe - I realized deep inside na maybe European ako by soul haha. The culture, food, the quiet, the nature excursions, even the cold that requires several layers of clothing in spring - Hindi ako meant to be a Filipino.

But I could also objectively say that we have destination spots in the PH na talagang maganda. Na ""paradise-like"" if you come from one of these developed nations.

Do you know the color of the sea sa northern Europe? It's indigo. It's nice and pretty-ish. But only in a clean way. Most people also don't go to the beach there because it's freaking cold. And their sea doesn't smell of salt.

Compare this to even a humble spot like Bolinao. Amoy mo ung asin sa ihip ng hanging. The water is as blue as the sky. And pag nag dive ka, makakakita ka ng mga magagandang isda at coral reefs.

Alam mo kung ano makikita mo pag nag dive ka sa beaches ng northern Europe? Bato. Mga bato bato hahaha. Unless siguro magpalaot kayo sa talagang gitna ng ocean to the point na it's too dangerous. That diving experience na bato lang ang makikita mo? Around 10k ang bayad to experience.

Most European countries are cold places with indigo seas. That's why the typical ""vacation"" for them often involves going to warmer beaches, like south of France or, if you want cheaper, Thailand or Philippines beaches. Tapos sa Pinas, you can even have the variety: beautiful beaches in the south. Tall and cold mountains in the North. Outside MNL, you can typically eat ""cheap"" savory food for less than $10. In certain touristy European nations, like Iceland for example, I have spent 1.7K pesos for a simple breakfast meal of eggs, sausages, bread, and coffee. And that's for their cheaper restos. The food is great. But for 1.7K, fancy-ish resto food for two na yan sa MNL.

This is why our country can seem like a ""paradise"" to the typical western foreigner. Also, our culture of chaos and noise gives them this sense of adventure that they can't normally have in their organized and postcard-perfect countries.

I would honestly prefer to live in Europe and become a European. I think I'd fit in better there haha. But the Philippines is truly beautiful. Puno lang sya ng kurakot na mga opisyales at sobrang bobong mga botante kaya hindi namamaximize. ",10,1753062026.0,unpopularopinionph,9,0.92,False

Been angry at myself because of the past mistakes I did. Anyways here's what actually stuck with me:

1. Make it obvious, not hidden. Stop relying on willpower and start designing your environment. I put my gym clothes next to my bed and my phone charger in the kitchen. Small changes, massive results.
2. Stack habits, don't isolate them. Instead of ""I'll meditate sometime today,"" I do ""After I pour my morning coffee, I meditate for 5 minutes."" Linking new habits to existing ones is like giving them a GPS.
3. Start stupidly small. I wanted to read more, so I committed to reading ONE PAGE per day. Sounds ridiculous, but I haven't missed a day in 8 months. Now I read 20-30 pages without even thinking about it.
4. Focus on identity, not outcomes. Instead of ""I want to lose 20 pounds,"" I started saying ""I'm the type of person who works out."" Every small action became evidence of who I was becoming, not just what I was trying to achieve.
5. Never miss twice. Life happens. You'll skip a workout or eat junk food. The key is getting back on track immediately. Missing once is an accident, missing twice is the beginning of a new habit.
6. Make it satisfying immediately. I created a simple habit tracker and checked off each completed habit. That little dopamine hit from marking an X kept me going when motivation died.
7. Environment beats willpower every time. I removed Instagram from my phone's home screen and put Kindle there instead. Guess what? I started reading more and scrolling less. Your environment is constantly voting for your habits.

What's one tiny habit you could start today that would compound into something amazing over time? And what's the smallest version of that habit you could commit to? I realized for me it was working out. I stacked my other habits from working out early in the morning thanks to this book.

Force Factor Test X180 Gummies: End The Coffee-Cup Cookie Cycle—Probiotic Yogurt & Omega Hacks,"**Fenugreek Vs. Force Factor Test X180 Gummies: End The Coffee-Cup Cookie Cycle—Probiotic Yogurt & Omega Hacks**

When it comes to enhancing wellness, the debate between natural remedies like fenugreek and modern supplements such as Force Factor Test X180 Gummies increasingly captures attention. Both options aim to improve overall health, but they take different approaches to combat issues like hormonal balance, energy levels, and sustained vitality.

Fenugreek, a herb with roots in ancient medicine, is celebrated for its myriad health benefits. This plant-based option is renowned for its potential to improve digestion, enhance testosterone levels, and facilitate weight loss. By incorporating fenugreek into your diet, you may find that energy levels stabilize, reducing the desire for mid-morning coffee-cup cookie snacks. The fibrous nature of fenugreek can also promote satiety, making it easier to resist unhealthy treats.

On the other hand, Force Factor Test X180 Gummies offer a contemporary twist on health enhancement. These gummies are formulated with a blend of vitamins, minerals, and probiotics, designed to support testosterone production while providing energy and muscle support. With the inclusion of probiotics, these gummies may also foster better digestive health, creating a balanced gut that can help you steer clear of unhealthy snacking habits.

Combining both fenugreek and Force Factor Test X180 Gummies can yield remarkable results. This versatile duo supports metabolic health through natural herbs and cutting-edge formulations. Furthermore, enhancing your diet with probiotic yogurt and incorporating Omega-3 fatty acids from sources like fish or flaxseed can significantly improve wellness. These Omega hacks can promote heart health and cognitive function, making it easier to navigate away from sugar-laden temptations.

Ultimately, transitioning from the cycle of coffee-cup cookies takes a multifaceted approach. By empowering your health with fenugreek and Force Factor Test X180 Gummies, alongside a balanced diet rich in probiotics and Omega-3s, you can pave the way toward a sustainable, health-oriented lifestyle.

1m55zi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/livingfromtheend/comments/1m55zi5/day_3_becoming_the_new_you/,Day 3 - Becoming the New You,"# Focus: Stabilising the Shift

Hey, you’ve made it to Day 3, this is where the magic starts to feel more real. If the first two days were about deciding what you want and shifting how you feel inside, today is where you actually start living as your new self.

It’s not about faking it, it’s about letting the *real you* rise to the surface. The you who already has what they want. The you who walks lighter, smiles easier, and moves through life with quiet certainty.

# Why Day Three is the Day You Stop “Trying” and Start “Being”

Let’s keep this simple.   
Think of it like this:

* **Day 1 = planting the seed**
* **Day 2 = watering the seed**
* **Day 3 = becoming the tree**

This is where you **stabilise the new version of you**, so it becomes your new normal.

# This is when you start walking around knowing you own the tree. Even if it hasn’t broken through the soil yet, you know it’s there. You start living like it’s yours.

This is the energy that changes everything. You stop acting like someone *hoping* to manifest something… and you start behaving like someone who simply *expects* it, because it’s done.

# Why Stabilisation is Where Everything Shifts

Here’s the real deal:  
“What you don’t stabilise, you keep fantasising.”

If you keep dipping in and out of your dream, visualising in the morning but worrying the rest of the day you stay stuck in limbo.

But when you stabilise, you build a home in the version of you who already has what they want. That energy becomes your new normal. And life will have no choice but to meet you there.

# Step 1: Building the Identity of “Already Me”

Stop asking yourself, “How do I get this?” because that keeps you in chasing mode.

Start asking, “Who am I when I already have this?”

It’s a subtle but powerful shift. Think about it, how does the you who’s in love wake up in the morning? How does the you with financial freedom carry themselves? Would they be refreshing their phone for signs? Or would they be sipping coffee, smiling, knowing good things are inevitable?

Tiny Action for Today:  
Start noticing these little details. Step into that version of you, bit by bit, breath by breath. Make it natural.

# Step 2: Your 3 Anchors to Stay in That Identity

# 1. End-State Anchoring, Feel It in Your Bones

Keep asking: “How would the version of me who already has this… stand, talk, text, breathe?”

* Straighten your back.
* Catch your inner talk and make it match your dream self.
* Drop words like “trying,” use “it’s done,” “I’m ready,” “it’s unfolding.”

Example affirmation to carry with you:  
“Everything is unfolding beautifully for me.”

Feel it. Let it sink into your muscles, your face, your posture. The version of you that’s living their dream doesn’t need to rush.

# 2. Inner Mood Maintenance - Your Mood is the Magnet

Your energy is what life listens to. Think: how does the version of you who *has it* feel most of the day? Calm? Grateful? Light?

So today, your focus isn’t just on moments of happiness, but on creating an **emotional home** in your dream life.

Gentle reminder:  
When doubts pop up (and they will), you don’t fight them. You simply notice and softly say, “That’s the old me… but I’m choosing again.”

Mood is a choice, not a task. And your new self feels good more often than not.

# 3. Conscious Reaction Practice, Where You Grow the Fastest

Here’s where real growth happens.  
Something annoying happens, an unexpected bill, a text left on read.  
Old you: panic, overthink.  
New you: pause… observe… choose differently.

The magic trick:  
Whenever you feel triggered, ask:  
“How does the version of me who already has this respond?”

That moment of choice will become your superpower.

# Step 3: The Simple Daily Rituals That Keep You in Flow

# Morning Identity Activation

Before touching your phone, stand tall in the mirror. Look into your eyes.  
“Today, I’m living as the version of me who already has \[desire\].”

Feel it. Visualise it for just 2 minutes. Smile like it’s happening now. End with:  
“I allow it. I accept it. I am it.”  
 Simple. Quick. Powerful.

# Midday Self-Check-In

Halfway through the day, check yourself, not to judge but to lovingly guide yourself back.  
“Who am I being right now?”

If you slipped, it’s okay. Smile. Shift. Choose again.

# Evening Gratitude & Identity Anchoring

At night, write down three things where you stayed aligned, even if it’s just remembering once! Progress is progress.  
Then write a short thank you note to your future self:  
“Thank you for leading us through this shift.”  
Fall asleep in your dream energy. Let your subconscious carry it through the night.

# Step 4: How to Hold the State Even When “Nothing Happens”

# Key Truth:

“Nothing happening” is an illusion.  
Energy rearranges behind the scenes even when you don’t see it. Your job is to hold the energy steady.

# Let’s be honest, sometimes, reality stays still. Nothing seems to happen.

This is where most people spiral.  
But not you. Because now you understand:  
“Quiet doesn’t mean nothing is happening. It means things are rearranging behind the scenes.”

Like a seed underground. Your job is to **hold your state**, not look for instant proof.

Here’s how to hold your state:

* Whisper “Regardless” when things wobble.  “Regardless of what I see, it’s working.”
* Journal from your future. “It felt so natural when it arrived.”
* Focus more on your mood than external proof.
* Celebrate your inner shifts, they’re just as valuable as physical signs.

# Step 5: Let Go of “When” and “How” Fall in Love with Trust

Letting go doesn’t mean giving up, it means releasing the pressure. It means relaxing into knowing.

It sounds like:  
“It’s mine. I don’t need to hover over it. I’m going to enjoy life while it arrives.”

Reminder:  
You don’t manifest with force. You manifest with **flow**.  
Your energy is your invitation. Calm trust is magnetic.

# Step 6: Celebration - Your Secret Shortcut

Why wait to celebrate after it arrives? Celebrate now.  
Feel the joy now.  
This flips your energy from lack to abundance instantly.

Easy ways to celebrate:

* Morning thank-you’s as if it’s done.
* Smile after small wins and whisper: “I’m showing up for my dream life.”
* Walk taller, dress better, dance more, because you know it’s done.
* Before bed, imagine the celebration moment: the call, the message, the breakthrough.

The universe responds fastest to those who live from joy, not waiting for life to give permission.

# Gentle Closing Reminder:

The old you might pop up. That’s okay.  
You might wobble. That’s okay.  
Just… keep… returning… home.

Today you don’t chase.  
Today you don’t beg.  
Today you live as the person who already has it.  
And life will catch up to *who you decide to be*.",1,1753061448.0,livingfromtheend,0,1.0,False
1m55zh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m55zh3/reclaiming_the_lunas_crown_novel_but_three_years/,"Reclaiming the Luna's Crown novel_ But three years later, the pack was gone, and so were my parents.","An “innocent” omega appeared, clinging to my mate, Alpha Shawn. He'd just bought her the custom necklace meant for me.

Shawn reassured me, ""Are you really getting jealous over some insignificant omega? You're the only one in my heart.""

But three years later, the pack was gone, and so were my parents.

Shawn tossed a blood-soaked jewelry box in front of me.

""You love necklaces, don't you? Silver, gold... but how could any of those compare to one made from your parents' finger bones?""

Desperately, I leaped from the rooftop of the villa.

When I opened my eyes again, I was back on the day the omega snatched my necklace.

This time, I let her take it.

I stepped aside and made the call.

""Jacob,"" I said. ""I need you.""

————————

1

""Alpha, this necklace is so beautiful. I want this one, can I?""

The brand-new, custom-made necklace was rudely snatched from my hand. I spun around, my shocked gaze landing on Shawn.

In my last life, he orchestrated my parents' ruin, driving them to suicide. He even had their finger bones cruelly sawn off and fashioned into a necklace.

I shoved down the hatred and terror clawing at my heart.

""Katrina... she's the new omega. She doesn't understand the pack's rules.""

""But this is the first time she has ever asked me for anything, and I've already promised her. You have a jewelry box overflowing with necklaces. Just let her have this one.""

His voice was gentle, yet it was laced with the undeniable authority of an Alpha, leaving no room for refusal.

Before I could utter a word, the omega shot me an apologetic look, her nose crinkling.

""Alpha, I'm so sorry... I didn't realize she was your mate. Have I caused trouble...?""

""Luna looks a little unhappy... Is she blaming me for taking her necklace? If that's the case, I don't need it...""

Her voice trembled, thick with unshed tears as her eyes reddened.

Shawn frowned and was about to speak when I thrust the necklace into the omega’s arms, patting her shoulder lightly.

""You already stole my mate, so what's stealing a necklace? Why the guilt now?""

My sharp words, paired with the sales associate’s disdainful glare, seemed to crush her.

Tears streamed down the omega’s face as if on cue. She shook her head, looking utterly wronged. ""It's not like that, I've never stolen anyone...""

Shawn grew flustered, clumsily trying to comfort her.

I watched them, unmoved, before stepping aside to dial a number.

The familiar, lazy voice on the other end of the line sent a jolt of confidence through me.

""Jacob, do me a favor.""

When I hung up, Shawn caught the smile playing on my lips and frowned in displeasure.

""Who were you on the phone with? You look happy.""

""No one important. Just a friend asking me out for coffee.""

I lied casually. He didn't suspect a thing.

After all, ever since becoming his mate, I had settled into the role of a full-time Luna, interacting with only a handful of werewolves, all of whom he controlled.

The tension in his brow eased slightly, and he managed a resigned smile. ""Katrina, since when did you become so petty? How can a completely insignificant omega make you this paranoid?""

""Alright, I was wrong this time. I promise, it won't happen again...""

""Also, if there's anything you've had your eye on lately, just say the word. Your Alpha will buy it for you.""

For the last six months, they had been inseparable at the company in Los Angeles. The entire Shadowridge Pack had seen their silhouettes, far too close for comfort, behind the privacy blinds of the CEO's office.

He openly paraded her at all sorts of high-end events, protecting her so impeccably that not even a fly could get near her.

Now, he bought her a three-million-dollar necklace without batting an eye, yet he still had the audacity to call her an ""insignificant omega.""

In the past, my fiery temper wouldn't have tolerated a single slight. I would have raised hell.

But I had lived this life before. I knew she was Shawn's Achilles' heel—absolutely untouchable.

Stepping back was the wisest move.

...

I relocated my parents to the Canadian border near Vancouver and seized control of the Moonshadow Pack's operations in Los Angeles.

Shawn was so completely wrapped up in the little omega that, naturally, he didn't notice the pieces I was moving into place.

""I don't know what's gotten into the Alpha lately. He's never home anymore,"" Betty, the housekeeper, reminded me kindly. ""If you ask me, Luna, you need to pay more attention. Don't let those other she-wolves out there steal him away!""

I gave a bitter smile.

These days, Shawn had been parading the omega around everywhere, spending lavishly.

He bought a multi-million dollar yacht on a whim, docked it at the Santa Monica pier, and threw parties that raged until dawn.

The villa on the Malibu coast was more luxurious than a palace.

Even the omega's family was taken care of; her good-for-nothing brother was made a manager at the pack's company.

A mature and dominant Alpha's pursuit of a she-wolf is simply irresistible.

Seeing the pained look on my face, Betty changed her tune to comfort me.

""Alphas, you know, they tend to have a wandering eye. Alpha Shawn has been so faithful for all these years, he's already better than most. As long as he doesn't bring the trouble home, it's not a big deal...""

Just then, Shawn appeared at the door, holding Maria's hand. His gaze bored into me.

""Katrina, I thought you were different from the other she-wolves. I never expected you to gossip behind my back!""

Before I could argue, he pulled Maria to the sofa. They curled up together. In that moment, they looked like the true Lord and Lady of the villa.

""I'm not comfortable with Maria living by herself. I've been thinking, it’s safer for her to stay here.""

""She's young, so you'll look after her. And make sure she's well-fed!""

I nodded with a faint smile and turned to head to the kitchen, but he called out to stop me.

""Don't bother preparing a separate room. She's staying with me.""

I froze, a suffocating tightness seizing my chest.

He wasn't comfortable sleeping with someone beside him. For the five years of our mate bond, we had always slept in separate rooms.

No matter how heated our passion, the moment it was over, he would coolly detangle himself, toss a towel onto the bed, and leave.

But now, he was willing to share his room with someone else.

He had truly fallen for her.

That night, as I passed his room, I could hear suggestive panting from within.

The omega was whispering, ""Alpha, if you want me, I'm willing...""

The next second, Shawn sealed my lips with a kiss. A long time passed before he finally spoke, his voice tinged with restraint.

""Silly girl, get some sleep.""

With that, he rolled out of bed and fled into the bathroom. The sound of the shower gushed out.

His restraint astonished me. To think he already adored her so much that he couldn't bear to even touch her.

I bit down hard on my lower lip and crept silently into Shawn’s study.

In my past life, the key to how he destroyed my parents' Moonshadow Pack so quickly was a top-secret file.

It contained vital business information about our pack.

This time, I was going to take that file in advance and prepare for the worst.

As I sat down at his desk, I saw that the photo from my bonding ceremony with Shawn had been replaced with a picture of Maria.

The she-wolf in the photo beamed with an innocent smile. It was a stark reminder that my bond with Shawn was already dead.

I suppressed the bitterness in my heart and quickly found the file.

It was password-protected.

In a panic, I tried every password I could think of for Shawn, but none worked.

Finally, as if guided by some unseen force, I punched in a string of numbers.

Staring at the ""Password Correct"" prompt: 20230507, my blood ran cold.

The day Shawn and Maria first met.

""Still awake this late, Katrina?""

At some point, Shawn had appeared, leaning against the door and watching me with a playful smirk.

""You're jealous, aren't you?""

I took a deep breath, looking at him with scorn.

""Didn't you say she was just an insignificant omega?""

Shawn shrugged helplessly.

""I don't know what's wrong with me. Just seeing her makes me... happy. I want to be with her every second. I've never felt this way before, Katrina. Is this what being poisoned feels like?""

""But don't worry. In my heart, no one can ever take your place...""

""Katrina, we haven't... in so long. Do you want to?""

...

As he spoke, he pressed his body against mine. His earlier arousal hadn't fully subsided, and now it flared again.

I quickly pulled away, a flash of disgust in my eyes.

I seized the opportunity to pull out the document I had prepared and handed it to him.

He raised an eyebrow. ""What have you set your sights on now? Fine, fine, whatever you like, I'll buy it for you!""

Without a second glance, he signed his name with a grand flourish.

My objective achieved, I ducked under his arm and slipped away, feigning exhaustion.

""I'm tired. Maybe next time.""

The fire another she-wolf started, and he expects me to put it out? In his dreams!

I clutched the agreement to sever our mate bond, my heart soaring.

Soon, I would be free.

The following week, Shawn went to Chicago for a pack business conference, leaving Maria at the house.

She showed no signs of restraint, brazenly ordering the servants around and meddling in every affair.

The household was soon filled with complaints.

Betty came rushing to me. ""Luna, you have to come quick! Miss Maria insists the moonbeam tree in the courtyard is an eyesore and wants it cut down. We tried to stop her, but she found an axe herself! She's threatening to chop off all the branches!""

My grandmother planted that moonbeam tree for me the year of my bonding ceremony with Shawn. She said it would watch over me, granting me a life of happiness and peace.

But Maria was determined to chop it down—a clear power play.

I rushed over, telling her to put the axe down.

She shot me a defiant glance, but upon spotting a dark figure in the distance, her foot conveniently slipped. She screamed as she fell backward.

""Ah!""

My eyes widened as I watched her fall from beside the tree, landing perfectly in Shawn's embrace.

The heavy axe, however, teetered precariously before it came crashing down on my leg. Blood gushed from the wound.

I gasped for breath, the pain overwhelming, as Shawn's furious voice roared.

""Katrina! You just had to go after her, didn't you!""

""Do you have any idea? A fall from that height could have been fatal!""

I managed to say weakly, ""It was an accident... it had nothing to do with me...""

""Don't think for a second I don't know what you did! You had the axe replaced, you smeared it with oil. You wanted Maria to get hurt!""

He glared at me with such venom, as if I were guilty of the most heinous crime.

Maria didn't have a scratch on her, yet he scooped her into his arms and rushed her to the hospital.

He didn't even glance at my leg, pinned beneath the heavy axe, already a mangled, bloody mess.

My leg required ninety-nine stitches. As I was heading to pay the bill in my wheelchair, biting back the pain, I saw Maria skipping playfully beside Shawn.

She saw me too and looked up innocently. ""Alpha, shouldn't you go help Luna? Maybe she really didn't mean to...""

Shawn shot me a look of disgust before pulling her protectively into his arms.

""She went too far this time. Don't mind her. Let her cool down.""

""Right now, being with you is my top priority.""

I stared blankly at their retreating figures, and the last shred of affection I held for Shawn burned to ash.

So be it, Shawn, I thought. I have a special gift for you, too.
