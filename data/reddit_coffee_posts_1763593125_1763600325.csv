(i had extra cash since i took out a loan from my boss that was double than what i needed to move in). then the fucker starts packing his shit slowly after bout a month of me being here and says he’s just putting stuff away under his bed. another month goes by and he tells me he lost a bunch of hours at work and is moving in with his uncle for free. told me he was leaving on sunday he ended up leaving on friday (when he knew i was at a concert) without a word stealing my marble coffee table he claims is his since he helped me move. along with my sore throat spray the single pair of utensils i brought and a few other really petty things(this was earlier this year). then left his full cat boxes broken gaming chair and a bed. i text him when i get home no reply’s for days till the landlord reached out for me. finally responds with the audacity saying im the nastiest person he’s ever seen and the way i live is vile so he had to move out, said he has all these pics and vids and never sends one to me or any mutual friends just says “nah i don’t wanna expose you”. said that i used to much toilet paper and filled up the trash too fast and was entitled to his things as in ps5 i used 1x and the canned goods i used and replaced. i literally deep cleaned the whole apartment the week i moved in because he hasn’t wiped a thing the 3 years he was here. i lived in my room since our cats didn’t get along and im not that social. i cleaned bi weekly, he never even swept the floor, cat hair buildup everywhere i’ve found toenail clippings in the kitchen and the white doors were stained black.

 resting heart rate is typically either the high end of average or tachycardiac, and even the mildest stimuli or extertion puts me into tachycardia making my heart rate spike up to the 130's.

My

I started to wonder if I have POTS, but it seems that I do not since my heart rate doesn't stay elevated (yk more than it already is, like it wont stay in the 120's-130's it'll go back down to 90's-100's) for very long once I'm relaxed again.

So idk what it is, and I'm unable to see any specialist or get any specialized testing done. The only healthcare i have access to is the PCP at the free clinic and this is out of their scope. 

​So I got a smart watch to track my heart rate. It also tracks other vitals and my sleep which is cool because I also have a sleeping disorder called N24. 

  
I'm aware smart watches are not medical devices and are not always 100% accurate, and on the first day of using mine I worried it wasn't accurate, but I just wasn't positioning it correctly. Once I positioned it correctly it got way more accurate.

  
I'm not saying mine is perfect, sometimes it's very slightly off, but when it is off it's usually only by just a few beats. Ik how to take my pulse myself and whenever I compare it to the watch now, it's either the same or only old by 2-4 beats, and my sleep times is also always accurate, so I think my smart ​watch is pretty accurate after all.

  
Anyway, so I like vietnamese coffee. But I was getting worried it could be making my tachycardia worse. So I tested it.

  
My resting heart rate was already tachycardiac before taking a single sip of my vietnamese coffee, it was in the 110's. I expected it to spike and get very high. Instead, the opposite happened. My resting heart rate DROPPED, almost 40bpm, during and after drinking vietnamese coffee. It got all the way down to 76 bpm, which was very shocking to me because the only time my pulse has ever been so low is while I'm asleep. How tf did VIETNAMESE coffee, which is known to be so strong, and the one I drank had 285mg of caffeine, how did it make my heart rate go from tachycardiac to my sleeping heart rate?",1,1763600094.0,self,0,1.0,False

I've had health anxiety/OCD for a while, but never to this level or having to do with sensory cues. It came on so quickly, and I can't completely get rid of it. I sometimes feel like I'm living a different life now.

One night about 2 months ago, I couldn't sleep, so I took a small piece of an edible. It ended up being too much, and I woke up high and anxious. The next morning, I drank a large cup of coffee to stay awake and started feeling funny before class. I ended up having a panic attack in the stairwell and some unpleasant stomach symptoms. Ever since then, I am attentive to any bodily sensation that could be even remotely associated with panicking or being sick (dizziness, stomach upset, random aches and pains). I'm on high alert. There have even been times I've woken up in the middle of the night with intense full body anxiety shivers. I've gotten better at dealing with it, but it still makes me uneasy. I do have a therapist that specializes in anxiety and have tried to incorporate some breathing techniques.

**THUMP**

The torture hurt.

**KA-CHUNK**

It *really* did

**CA-CRACK**

Even broke a few of my bones for good measure

**SWISH**

**THUD**

But it was *hilarious*. They couldn't even make a dog whine with how they were going about this. That didn't stop them from beating the absolute shit outta me and James for fuck all in terms of info. They hit harder when we laughed or mocked them. ""My *baby nephews* can hit harder than you. Try harder!"" I egged my interrogatior on, the lizard whipping me with it's tail, the thing hitting as hard as a whip. I spat out the blood pooling in my right cheek, my left teeth just covered in my red, iron-rich blood. I smiled, having learned it was a sign of challenge or dominance to the Axur. The Lizard Man hissed and growled, clearly aggravated. He was about to hit me again when the door behind him opened, the familiar scarred face of Isif walking in, chipped teeth and all.

""You should see a dentist. You need a few dentures."" I commented, the Axur not finding me funny one bit. ""Hmph. Humor. Talkativeness. Traits of a pack speices. I will ask you a few questions now. Go, Viskal, I can take it from here."" Said the older Lizard, the interrigator storming off. A tense silence hung in the air as the Chief Hunter studied me, sniffing my hair. When he neared the left side of my face I leaned away as far as I can, eliciting a strange look from the alien. It sat across from me and leaned forward, narrowing its eyes. 

""Your kind. How many are you?"" He asked, looking into my eyes. ""Eh... about four billion, give or take. Haven't been able to get bigger with the Terminators killing anything that looks remotely human."" I explain, eliciting a strange look from the Lizard. ""And these... *Terminators*... why are you fighting them?"" He asked, curiosity in his eyes rather than anger or malice. I had explained at length planetside, but i huffed, blood escaping from my teeth. ""Skynet, the maker of those monstrosities, became self aware decades ago. They nearly wiped us out when we tried to pull the plug, fearing that it would do exactly what it did. We've been at war for... fuck, nearly 60 years now. Many of the former humans that lived before Judgement Day, the day Skynet tried to eradicated us with nuclear hellfire. They said it was nigh a paradise compared to now. Full meals, great ideals, the whole nine."" I explained, the Grey Lizard seeming to go in deep thought. He was different from his subordinates, I could tell. He didn't lash out, attack, or threaten nearly as often. Which showed his true colors to people who knew how to look. 

""And what of your culture?"" He asked, just as the pain finally started to set in. I winced before speaking, taking note at how cut up I looked in a reflection on a wall.  ""We were very idealistic. We believed we could always be better than yesterday, and strived for better things. We had flaws like corruption and stuff, but we were close to a utopia of sorts. We were artistic, diverse, equal on nearly everything. Then Skynet brought down the foundation, making us revert back to our old ways just to survive."" I say, rolling my shoulders back, watching the Axur's reactions. He seemed baffled, surprised by my admission and explanation. He looked down at his hands, studying the patterns the scales seemed to have before wringing his wrists, standing. ""I am satisfied, for now. I will have someone unchained you and give you some commodities. I have also looked through your mobile device. Your kind seems to value cleaning as a part of health, even in your dire straights, so I will send someone to clean you. I will be back at an unspecified time, yes?"" He said, walking out before talking with someone in a hushed voice, another Axur male taking my binds off of me, walking out shortly after and locking the door. I leaned back in the chair and closed my eyes, thinking of home.

I scowled as I watched the new Predators set up a command center in the main lobby of the palace, the Humans speaking to the squads on the ground and each other. I will give them credit, they were extremely efficient, especially with that Super AI called Skynet helping them instead of fighting them. I stood on the stairs leading to the upper floors, watching this impromptu command center do my own job for me; fighting the Grey's. They seemed adept and adapted to the Axur's tactics with ease, the defense of thr capital going smoother than initially anticipated. I began moving back up the steps, my vision catching Corporal Williams still watching over Tarva. I spent each hour wondering if he ate her or not, but no, he just seemed... worried about her. It was hard to wrap my head around, but these new Predators seemed far more empathetic than even most Venlil from what I've observed, being grateful squads came out with little casualties and reacting negatively ehrn casualty reports came in. 

I cleared my throat, startling Williams out of a state of deep thought, the Human turning and saluting me, his form nigh perfect. I waved my hand, the darker Human seeming confused for a moment before moving out of my way and to a chair, looking at me. ""No change. She seems to be sleeping peacefully. Pulse steady."" He said, rubbing his hands together. It was, indeed, getting cold, but i luckily had fur. ""You do not have to look over her."" I said, facing an eye to him, the predator rubbing the back of It's neck. ""I know, I just... feel like I have to protect her. The hurt and exhaustion in her eyes... it made me hurt, too."" He admitted, making my eyes widen, my tail straightening. Empathy... pure empathy. Not just in body language, but flowing through it's... no, *his* speech. I slowly made my way over to him, making a few reassuring gestures eith my tail and ears. ""She will be fine, Noah Williams. You need rest, too."" I urged, pushing the human out, closing the door behind me. I then made my way to the war table, an aging captain leaning on it, staring at the holographic display. Units were colored based on affiliation. Humans were blue, Venlil were yellow, Skynet was red, and the Grey's were... well... Grey.

I looked at Captain Hannah expectantly, blinking slowly. He looked up briefly before explaining the developments so far. ""The Axur seemed to largely lack much doctrine when invading the planet before we arrived, now they seem to have tactics we used during the Cold War. They have nothing that can stand against plasma weaponry, and largely get cut down before they can get to the barbed wire we set up."" He explained, pointing at a few points to emphasize his points. Hearing the Humans had more advanced tactics than the Axur was both a relief and terrifying at the same time, but their help was absolutely needed and I could not turn anything away now. ""Right. That's a discussion for another time. Any sign of a pull out?"" I asked, gulping as Hannah's gaze became steely. ""Hawking Gunships and Hunter-Killer Gunships assigned to scouting report that a decreas in ground forces is noticeable, but we can expect the siege of this city to last through Christmas."" He said, eliciting a head cock from me. He smirked slightly. ""It's a holiday meant to spread joy and cheer, a time of family and gift giving. It one of the most important holidays ever. I was supposed to have a nice meal with my kids..."" He frowned, as did I. I did hear the Humans mention it in passing, but understanding what it was and what it meant to them meant more as I learned more about them. Maybe the Venlil could help more Humans celebrate Christmas, but my main focus was on breaking the siege. ""Could we perhaps push them away? Get them to retreat?"" I asked in false hope, knowing the answer. ""We don't have the forces, I'm afraid. Our best hope is to wait for the Axur to leave. Until then, we can only respond to their moves."" He said grimly, grabbing a cup of hot, black liquid. It smelled bitter, but her sipped it with reverence. ""Ahh... sad that this is my last Coffee ration..."" he said with a frown, offering me a sip. I declined, opting to walk away. This Siege was the last thing the Venlil needed, but Hannah was right. We needed to be conservative with our forces, considering the Humans', Skynet's, and my own forces being low on manpower, among other problems.

I turned to a window and placed a paw on the window, looking to my former residence, now crushed under Skynet's Battleship. I looked away as I began remembering my parents, my paw clenching into a fist as I calmed myself, tears streaming down my face. Since I was alone, i began breaking down, hugging myself as I began full on sobbing, falling to my knees, then my side as I cried, hearing footsteps come up slowly, but not being able to stop. I felt a pair of arms wrap around me, and recognized the white sleeves of Robert Hannah's Captains Uniform. I buryvmy head into his chest and just cry. I felt a weird sense of safety when he comforted me, like I wasn't vulnerable at all, but I cried harder, soaking his uniform letting all the trauma and bad news flow out through incoherent sobbing and my tears. He began rubbing my scalp in smoothing motions, rocking back and fourth. I didn't know why, but it felt like he was encouraging me to just let it out.

Once I did stop, he let go and moved away, leaving me to react as I would. I got up and walked away, too exhausted and feeling too strange to dress his act of kindness. I navigated the halls to my quarters and lied on my modest cot, falling asleep due to exhaustion. I probably needed it, but I felt a little bad to be sleeping now, allowing my troops to be ordered by AI and Predators. But, I had to trust them if this defense was going to work.

I slowly drifted off, feeling like I had the weight of the universe lifted off my shoulders...",2,1763599985.0,NatureofPredators,1,1.0,False
1p1pe5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1p1pe5c/i_dont_know_if_im_doing_the_right_thing_by/,"I don't know if I'm doing the right thing by abruptly moving out of my parents' house . I need advice , please .","I need your opinion . I ( 19F ) decided that I'm moving out of my parents' house in Houston to move in with my grandma in Los Angeles . I decided this because I feel unwanted n unappreciated here with my parents . For context , the relevant issues began back in April of this year when I was forced to go on a 2 week trip to Greece for my mom's birthday that I didn't want to go to because I didn't want to miss out on work n money n because my mom is a difficult person to be around . I stated that the plane ticket , that I would have to pay for , was too steep , but I ended up paying for it because she guilted me by asking if she wasn't worth however much the ticket costed . Fast forward a couple weeks , my dad came to me asking to borrow 4 grand . I gave it to him . He came to me two or three more times for more money n the total dollar amount that he borrowed from me came out to upwards of $9,000 . Fast forward again , I went on the trip with my family n we flew from Houston to Istanbul where I was separated from my family after asking them to wait for me since I was sitting separate from them n was denied . The first text I got was to „ turn my f****** phone on "" instead of any worrying or reassurance . I spent the next hour making my way to my family . I was later scolded because I was going to „ make us miss our flight . "" When we got home from the trip, my parents revealed to me that I would have to buy my dad new AirPods because he dropped them while „ running around looking for me . "" When I lent my dad all the money , he said he would give me $200 - $300 in interest . I fought it , but I eventually caved n just said that they could use that interest I was supposed to get for the AirPods . 

The next incident was when my mom found out just how much money my dad had borrowed from me ( because apparently she didn't know ) n said it was partly my fault that he hadn't paid me back because she had told me in the past not to lend him money . Mind you , I lent him money because not only is he my dad , but he came crying to me when asking . How could I have said no ? On top of that , had I said no , I would've been deemed selfish n cold hearted . We'll come back to that later . 

The incident after this , my family n I were planning a trip to Los Angeles in November of this year back in late July n I spoke to my boss before any real plans were set into stone just to see what days I would be able to take off that month because plenty of my coworkers were also looking to take time off . I told him which days I would likely be taking off n he told me to request them off right then that way my request was in the system n it would be doable because no one else had beat me to it . I told my mom about that n she blew up at me . We got into an argument about it where she accused me of making my own plans , which I wasn't . She insisted I was lying n that I'm a compulsive liar . I eventually got tired n asked what the big deal was if I had made my own plans , stating that I'm an adult n don't need permission to make plans . That set my parents off . My dad yelled at me n my mom started hitting me . I didn't do anything but yell at her to get her hands off of me . It was an extremely emotionally charged event . It ended with me leaving the house . I stayed with friends n made a plan to move in with my grandma that same week . Before I left , my parents asked me to come pick my things up n talk with them so I did . I was dead set on leaving , but it ended up being roughly 5 hours of talking where my parents were crying n begging me to stay , saying that they would change . I believed them n didn't go through with my plan . That was back in August . 

Skipping all other relatively minor incidents , now I'm here . A couple days ago my dad came to talk to me to ask me how visiting my grandma went. I visited my grandma , my dad's mom who my parents cut off , on this past trip to Los Angeles . He basically told me that he n my mom were hurt that I had gone to visit her even though they're not talking to her n my mom even more so because I took my boyfriend to meet my grandma when my mom had asked me not to . I stated that even though they've told me some past things my grandma has supposedly said n done , that they hadn't told me the most recent reason for why they cut her off . I stated that it was none of my business what goes on between them , n that I have my own relationship with her because I'm an adult n only I get to decide who is or isn't in my life . It went on about that n then segued into my dad telling me that he would no longer be buying me food when he got the family takeout . We had talked about this before , but he didn't put it into effect so I asked if it was retaliation because I visited my grandma . He said no n kept insisting throughout the conversation . He said that before , his heart was telling him to pay for it because he owed me money . Then he said that now his heart wasn't telling him to do that anymore because „ that's almost done , "" mind you they still owe me over $2,000 , n because I make faces when he asks me to do things . He said that he likes to think he has a kind heart n basically implied that I have an unkind heart . 

After that conversation is when I decided it was time for me to go . That was a few days ago . 

Since then my sister told me that my dad explicitly told her that he doesn't think I have a kind heart n that my parents together had a talk with her saying that I'm selfish n cold hearted . This was the same day I got my mom a coffee she asked for n a cup I knew she wanted . 

My mom also said I was stingy with my money . I'm a teenager who works a minimum wage job . I pay $600 in rent , $50 for my phone bill , I don't drive so I pay to get myself to n from work with uber , I pay $30 a month for the family Netflix , I'm trying to save for my car ( I had reached my goal back in April but gave my entire car fund to my dad ) , I buy whatever my parents ask me to because I work by Target without asking for the money back , I take my sisters out n treat them , etc etc . 

In terms of being selfish , I get up every weekday morning to make sure my sisters are up for school , I changed my work schedule so that I could watch my baby brother while my mom took my sister to her speech therapy , I bring my siblings goodies whenever I can from work , I also bring my parents goodies , I bring my mom n dad coffees , I always offer them food , whether it's leftovers from me going out to dinner or doordashing , etc etc . 

I'm not any of the things they've said . I know that's coming from me , but my sisters , my friends , my coworkers , my boss all disagree with everything they've said about me . They're the only ones who think of me that way . 

I've figured it all out on my own . My parents didn't go to college , so I had to figure out how to apply n choose what to do n where to go by myself . I had to take out a loan for my first two years n I paid it back with none of their help . I work 40+ hours a week , getting myself to n from work . I made an arrangement with my friend who's teaching me how to drive . I'm saving up for my car . I pay for my flights when we go on vacation . My parents pay for my food when we're actually on vacation n I pay them back when we get home . I'm in school , I have a full time job , I do my chores , n I take care of my sibling n to an extent my parents . I'm extremely responsible , especially for my age , I know that for a fact , but yet I still get criticized . I'm still insulted , even if not directly to my face , behind my back to my younger siblings who look up to me which is significantly worse . I just don't know what to do anymore , I don't know if I can stay here anymore .

 I've got everything lined up n a plan all figured out . I'm planning to tell my parents I'm moving out on my birthday in two weeks where I'll ask them for a couple of days to pack my things . I'll then ship my moving boxes through ups n fly to California the next day . I have already made steps to execute my plan but I find myself doubting . I'm doubting if I'm doing the right thing or if I'm justified in doing this . I'm scared n full of doubt , but at the same time I feel like I have to do this even if I don't want to . I don't know , I'm so conflicted . On one hand , I feel bad that im sneaking around making this plan , but on the other hand I feel like I shouldn't feel guilty . It's just hard because im so passive when it comes to my parents n im not one to keep grudges , but it keeps on happening n that's the issue . I'm just scared I'm going to lose my nerve n cave when the time comes to tell them . Ideally none of this would be weighing down on me , but I can't take it anymore . It hurts n I can feel my mental health taking a hit every time I hear about something they said to my siblings or every time there's an argument between us .

I love my parents though , n I really wish I didn't have to consider leaving them so soon . They're not like this all the time , but because they are sometimes I have to consider what might be best for me .

1p1pbov,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Individual_Minute883/comments/1p1pbov/i_dont_know_if_im_doing_the_right_thing_by/,I don't know if I'm doing the right thing by abruptly moving out of my parents' house,"I need your opinion . I ( 19F ) decided that I'm moving out of my parents' house in Houston to move in with my grandma in Los Angeles . I decided this because I feel unwanted n unappreciated here with my parents . For context , the relevant issues began back in April of this year when I was forced to go on a 2 week trip to Greece for my mom's birthday that I didn't want to go to because I didn't want to miss out on work n money n because my mom is a difficult person to be around . I stated that the plane ticket , that I would have to pay for , was too steep , but I ended up paying for it because she guilted me by asking if she wasn't worth however much the ticket costed . Fast forward a couple weeks , my dad came to me asking to borrow 4 grand . I gave it to him . He came to me two or three more times for more money n the total dollar amount that he borrowed from me came out to upwards of $9,000 . Fast forward again , I went on the trip with my family n we flew from Houston to Istanbul where I was separated from my family after asking them to wait for me since I was sitting separate from them n was denied . The first text I got was to „ turn my f****** phone on "" instead of any worrying or reassurance . I spent the next hour making my way to my family . I was later scolded because I was going to „ make us miss our flight "" to Athens . When we got home from the trip, my parents revealed to me that I would have to buy my dad new AirPods because he dropped them while „ running around looking for me . "" When I lent my dad all the money , he said he would give me $200 - $300 in interest . I fought it , but I eventually caved n just said that they could use that interest I was supposed to get for the AirPods . 

The next incident was when my mom found out just how much money my dad had borrowed from me ( because apparently she didn't know ) n said it was partly my fault that he hadn't paid me back because she had told me in the past not to lend him money . Mind you , I lent him money because not only is he my dad , but he came crying to me when asking . How could I have said no ? On top of that , had I said no , I would've been deemed selfish n cold hearted . We'll come back to that later . 

The incident after this , my family n I were planning a trip to Los Angeles in November of this year back in late July n I spoke to my boss before any real plans were set into stone just to see what days I would be able to take off that month because plenty of my coworkers were also looking to take time off . I told him which days I would likely be taking off n he told me to request them off right then that way my request was in the system n it would be doable because no one else had beat me to it . I told my mom about that n she blew up at me . We got into an argument about it where she accused me of making my own plans , which I wasn't . She insisted I was lying n that I'm a compulsive liar . I eventually got tired n asked what the big deal was if I had made my own plans , stating that I'm an adult n don't need permission to make plans . That set my parents off . My dad yelled at me n my mom started hitting me . I didn't do anything but yell at her to get her hands off of me . It was an extremely emotionally charged event . It ended with me leaving the house . I stayed with friends n made a plan to move in with my grandma that same week . Before I left , my parents asked me to come pick my things up n talk with them so I did . I was dead set on leaving , but it ended up being roughly 5 hours of talking where my parents were crying n begging me to stay , saying that they would change . I believed them n didn't go through with my plan . That was back in August . 

Skipping all other relatively minor incidents , now I'm here . A couple days ago my dad came to talk to me to ask me how visiting my grandma went. I visited my grandma , my dad's mom who my parents cut off , on this past trip to Los Angeles . He basically told me that he n my mom were hurt that I had gone to visit her even though they're not talking to her n my mom even more so because I took my boyfriend to meet my grandma when my mom had asked me not to . I stated that even though they've told me some past things my grandma has supposedly said n done , that they hadn't told me the most recent reason for why they cut her off . I stated that it was none of my business what goes on between them , n that I have my own relationship with her because I'm an adult n only I get to decide who is or isn't in my life . It went on about that n then segued into my dad telling me that he would no longer be buying me food when he got the family takeout . We had talked about this before , but he didn't put it into effect so I asked if it was retaliation because I visited my grandma . He said no n kept insisting throughout the conversation . He said that before , his heart was telling him to pay for it because he owed me money . Then he said that now his heart wasn't telling him to do that anymore because „ that's almost done , "" mind you they still owe me over $2,000 , n because I make faces when he asks me to do things . He said that he likes to think he has a kind heart n basically implied that I have an unkind heart . 

After that conversation is when I decided it was time for me to go . That was a few days ago . 

Since then my sister told me that my dad explicitly told her that he doesn't think I have a kind heart n that my parents together had a talk with her saying that I'm selfish n cold hearted . This was the same day I got my mom a coffee she asked for n a cup I knew she wanted . 

My mom also said I was stingy with my money . I'm a teenager who works a minimum wage job . I pay $600 in rent , $50 for my phone bill , I don't drive so I pay to get myself to n from work with uber , I pay $30 a month for the family Netflix , I'm trying to save for my car ( I had reached my goal back in April but gave my entire car fund to my dad ) , I buy whatever my parents ask me to because I work by Target without asking for the money back , I take my sisters out n treat them , etc etc . 

In terms of being selfish , I get up every weekday morning to make sure my sisters are up for school , I changed my work schedule so that I could watch my baby brother while my mom took my sister to her speech therapy , I bring my siblings goodies whenever I can from work , I also bring my parents goodies , I bring my mom n dad coffees , I always offer them food , whether it's leftovers from me going out to dinner or doordashing , etc etc . 

I'm not any of the things they've said . I know that's coming from me , but my sisters , my friends , my coworkers , my boss all disagree with everything they've said about me . They're the only ones who think of me that way . 

I've figured it all out on my own . My parents didn't go to college , so I had to figure out how to apply n choose what to do n where to go by myself . I had to take out a loan for my first two years n I paid it back with none of their help . I work 40+ hours a week , getting myself to n from work . I made an arrangement with my friend who's teaching me how to drive . I'm saving up for my car . I pay for my flights when we go on vacation . My parents pay for my food when we're actually on vacation n I pay them back when we get home . I'm in school , I have a full time job , I do my chores , n I take care of my sibling n to an extent my parents . I'm extremely responsible , especially for my age , I know that for a fact , but yet I still get criticized . I'm still insulted , even if not directly to my face , behind my back to my younger siblings who look up to me which is significantly worse . I just don't know what to do anymore , I don't know if I can stay here anymore .

 I've got everything lined up n a plan all figured out . I'm planning to tell my parents I'm moving out on my birthday in two weeks where I'll ask them for a couple of days to pack my things . I'll then ship my moving boxes through ups n fly to California the next day . I have already made steps to execute my plan but I find myself doubting . I'm doubting if I'm doing the right thing or if I'm justified in doing this . I'm scared n full of doubt , but at the same time I feel like I have to do this even if I don't want to . I don't know , I'm so conflicted . On one hand , I feel bad that im sneaking around making this plan , but on the other hand I feel like I shouldn't feel guilty . It's just hard because im so passive when it comes to my parents n im not one to keep grudges , but it keeps on happening n that's the issue . I'm just scared I'm going to lose my nerve n cave when the time comes to tell them . Ideally none of this would be weighing down on me , but I can't take it anymore . It hurts n I can feel my mental health taking a hit every time I hear about something they said to my siblings or every time there's an argument between us .

I love my parents though , n I really wish I didn't have to consider leaving them so soon . They're not like this all the time , but because they are sometimes I have to consider what might be best for me . 

Am I doing the right thing ? Is it justifiable ? Do I have a good enough reason ? I need help",1,1763599798.0,u_Individual_Minute883,0,1.0,False

I’ll often have my iPhone sitting on a dock, unlocked while working, but while I’m in another room, in the bathroom, making a coffee, outside, or dealing with the kids. In those moments, I rely on my Apple Watch to actually notify me. But because the phone is unlocked on the dock, the watch stays silent. How does that make any sense?

We pay top dollar for Apple products because they’re supposed to offer quality and flexibility. Instead, Apple hard-locks the notification behaviour so users get *less* control. Why can’t we simply choose to receive notifications on both devices at the same time, regardless of whether the phone is locked or not?

A quick online search shows I’m far from the only one frustrated by this. The feature request has been around for years, and Apple still refuses to give users the option.

It’s things like this that genuinely make me consider going back to Android. Let your customers decide how they want their devices to behave. Removing choice for no good reason is just pathetic.",2,1763599581.0,AppleWatch,2,0.75,False

Dear D****

When I met you... I was instantly drawn to you. You had an unmatched energy the was worth admiring. When we talked I couldn't get enough. When you said yes to that first date, I was amazed... I expected you to laugh at me and walk away... 

----

3 1/2 years have passed since that first date.

I flew to the other side of the country to see you, and ended up bringing you and your wonderful children back home with me. This was supposed to be the beginning of our happily ever after... But then the red flags started to emerge... 

Our living situation wasn't ideal. But we made it work. My roommate started coming to me with complaints and problems. I ignored them all... I tried to get them to see the light at the end of the tunnel... but the situation only got worse... so we started looking for a new place together. 

We shopped around together, to find the perfect place to accommodate our little family, and when we found it we were excited, it was centralized, affordable, and close to where we both worked, and literally across the street from the daycare you used. It was 100% what we were looking for. This was once again supposed to be the beginning of our happily ever after... but alas no... more red flags... 

The drinking began, and the late nights after work started to emerge. All of our mutual friends started coming to me expressing concerns. She said this tonight about you... she never has anything good to say about you... I watched her exchange numbers with another guy tonight... little things here and there... and then the nit picking when we were at the house... ""It annoys me when you leave your Splenda wrappers on the counter."" ""Did you eat my Vegan Teriyaki bowl from the freezer?"" ""Why did you do the laundry, I was going to do that?"" ""I told you I was going to do the dishes..."" 

The problem here is, the Splenda wrappers were only there for 2 minutes while a stirred my cup of coffee... The Teriyaki bowl had been eaten 3 nights prior after she'd come home from drinking after work... The laundry... with 2 kids full time and 2 kids part time the laundry builds up fast... and when it's been 3 weeks, it's just easier to do it versus argue about it... the dishes... when you need a spoon to get the toddler her morning cereal and there are none in the drawer, and all the bowls are in the sink dirty from the last 2 days of meals, it's easier to just wash the dishes versus argue about them...

This became the routine... listening to someone tell you what they're gonna do, and it never happening. Frustrating building and resignation settling in... over and over again...

Finally making the decision that things needed to change, I found a new place and moved out... 2 weeks later, she gets into scooter accident, and I'm the only one around willing to take her to the ER. She ends up with a broken arm... and says to me when we're sitting there waiting for the doctor, ""looks like you're going to have to move back in because I'm going to need your help.""... resigned and hopeful, I do... 

Now she ""can't"" do any of the household things, I get used to taking care of everything, which is fine, I had no problem with it, because the expectation was set. Things were good! Progress was being made! Until we get a proverbial knock at the door... Her aunt needing a place to stay, which turns into her cousins needing a place to stay... which turns into us needing a bigger place... which turns into her uncle needing a place to stay. 

Never once was I asked my thoughts... I was just expected to accept the situation... which I did... to a fault I did... for 11 months I did... never questioning just dealing. 

Once she got her cast off and started her physical therapy her need for me started to change, but not the expectations... where I expected her to jump in and start helping around the house, I was wrong... now there are 4 adults, 7 kids (all under the age of 8) in the house full time, and add 2 more kids every other weekend, the dishes and the laundry and the every day cleaning is a huge task, add the fact that I'm the only one in the house working... it starts to take a toll on me... and when I mention to her or the other parents that I could use some help, I'm treated with guilt and disdain... 

3 months of this then she and I go to a concert where she ends up breaking her leg... now she once again ""can't"" help... and the other 2 adults are not going to step up and help... it all falls on me... again... 

6 months of this until her family finally moves into an RV, and moves on... she's finally about to get up and walk around she's gotten a job and things are finally starting take a positive turn for us... finally time for things to calm down... time to start our happily ever after again... wrong... 

2 weeks of mellow and positive vibes turns into, ""I need space, and me and the kids are moving to Kansas."" 

No thank you for taking care of us... No thank you for putting up with my family... nothing... just ""we're moving""... and that's just what they did... they moved... 

The first week of September 2024... my house is empty... it's quiet... it hollow... it's haunting... 

November the texts started coming in... text from a number I didn't recognize... and after received 8-10 I would finally block them. And about a month later they'd start again... 

In February I received a bunch of emails... these were emails that appeared to be sent to me by me... this was spooky because I didn't send them... so I opened one. It had an attachment. The attachment was a video, en explicit video... it was a video of her... confused and not knowing what to do, I deleted all the emails. I hadn't talked to her in a few months, I wasn't sure I wanted to talk to her... I was trying to move on... I also didn't want to alarm her, there was a chance that you sent them to me, or you sent them to me as an accident... I didn't know. I chose not to engage... so I deleted them. 

Then a few days later the texts started again... and these texts would happen about once a month every month. Until a received a call in May. You asked how I felt about you coming home. 

9 months... I'd finally started to heal, I had started dating, I was starting to feel comfortable in my own skin again... and now you call me... 

Of course, I say yes... much to the dismay of every one of our friends... against the advice of my closest friends... I say yes... 

June 1st, you and the kids arrive at my door again... the energy is different than when you left... you have that energy that I originally fell in love with... you were back... that sparkle in your eyes had returned! Our happily ever after was happening... finally... 

No... no... there's no chance at getting my hopes up. I don't know why I let myself fall back into the trap... 

Right back into the same routine... me doing the dishes, me doing the laundry, me driving the kids to school every single day... and taking care of everything... again... I'm too tired, I have a headache, I don't feel well... once you got a job, it only lasted 2 months then you walked away from it... to go back into the routine again... and now that I'm asking you to change that routine...  you decide it's the perfect time to put your plan into action. 

It's been 5 months... we're into November, and this past Friday you finally admit to me that you're leaving. you're leaving again, this time you and the kids are moving to Texas. 

This time I decide to ask questions... why? Why are you moving... and then the ""truth"" comes spilling out... in September, when I handed her my laptop to help her finish some documents for the job at the time, she said she'd found an email. That email had an explicit video of her. She felt  violated and betrayed that I had it. It looked like you had gotten into her online accounts and downloaded it and sent it to yourself. And she no longer feels safe with me... and then all the text and emails I'd received came pouring back... all the sudden the things that I was trying to ignore became very relevant... 

So I explained them to her, and I showed her all the text. I explained that I thought I'd deleted the emails... and I explained my reasoning... she didn't care... she didn't believe me... she'd already made up her mind... I went from being the safe provider for her and her children to being the villain in her story... presumably overnight...  no matter how much I tried and no matter how much I pleaded... it didn't matter... I guess it doesn't matter. So I'm just going to do what I always do... give in and accept... am is supposed to fight? Am I supposed to beg? Am I supposed to plead? 

So now I sit here and wait... wait for them to leave again... Sitting here watching as my life and my emotions are turned upside down again... this time I'm done. I won't be answering her phone calls... I won't be responding to texts from her... I'm choosing me this time... 

----

Now, I've raise my kids to understand that even if the truth hurts it's always better... lying only makes the situation worse... and the repercussions of telling the lie versus just starting with the truth... as a parent seeing your children understand something you tell them and put it into action is one of the greatest feelings in life... but watching an adult look you in the eye and lie to you, especially when you know they are lying... hurts... it makes you feel disrespected... it makes you feel untrusted... it makes you feel small...

Accountability... it's an amazing word... especially when you expect someone besides yourself to experience it... 

Dating back to April of 2022, I can count the times on one had where you actually account for a mistake or your actions. Choosing to pass blame, or explain away, or make excuses, and flat out lie to completely avoid accountability...

The reason I write this addition is because the truth in this case is she needed a villain... she needed someone to blame... I've learned that she has a ""friend"" willing to help her in Texas. She says she has a job offer there but it doesn't start until January. So the next 2 months someone has to fill the void she's abandoning by leaving me. She needs someone to take care of everything for her. Someone to pay the bills, someone to do the dishes... someone to do the laundry. The next villain in her story. 

I'm not innocent in my part of this story... I know there was stress and I know I said my share of things... but I didn't deserve to be manipulated into doing everything... I could have stood my ground and walked away many times... but I chose to stay. I chose to help... I chose her... 

Now I'm choosing me... I'm choosing my kids...

My wife and I are planning a **6-month backpacking trip around South America** starting mid-January, and we’d love some feedback from those who’ve been.

This isn’t a rigid “must-follow” plan — we just love having a rough guide to keep our travels flowing smoothly. 😊 We’re also on a **tight budget** (thanks Antarctica 😅), so we’re trying to use **overnight buses** and keep flights to a minimum.

👉 **Does our route flow well, or are we zig-zagging too much?**  
👉 **Any must-know tips for crossing borders or using buses?**  
👉 **Are there any bus passes (country or regional) similar to Eurail to save money?**  
👉 **Anything we should cut, swap, or reorder?**

We’re hoping our draft itinerary helps others who are planning something similar — and would be super grateful for any advice, warnings, or “don’t miss this!” tips.

Artist, writer, cosplayer.
Looking for the one who loves slow-burn stories.

I'm searching for a real relationship with a girl who loves nerdy things or would be interested in couples cosplay and is ready for something serious. We would start online and go from there. A partner who I can call a best friend.

Big Final Fantasy fan, so if you give off JRPG love interest energy, we'll definitely get along. I'm working on a Cloud cosplay myself!

I like to draw, cosplay, read, and write fantasy. In the next five years I plan to have a Creative Writing MFA and two published novels. With my partner we'd go on coffee shop or book store dates, or long video calls full of laughter and anime. Co-op gaming or just watching each other game always welcome.

As for me, I'm physically fit, ambitious, and creative. I don't choose easily, but when I do I'm all in. I'm pretty playful typically and high energy, but also steady when I need to be.

I’m most drawn to women with a cute face, feminine, slim or athletic, and takes care of her health. Someone kind with similar values and has something she is passionate about. I have a thing for natural beauty (especially face-wise), so my type goes from Yuna from FFX for a softer, kind look to Tifa from FF7 for the more refined and feminine.

My non-negotiables are loyalty and communication. Someone who stays when it gets hard.

Hey there! 

I'm in the need of fast cash so hoping to sell my QK75N - Willing to sell with or without the caps/switches. Works perfectly fine, in good condition. Hoping to get $130 shipped CONUS for the board itself, or $170 with switches and caps. Unfortunately I was supremely stupid during a move and don't have the rest of the keyset, so what's on the keyboard is what you get. 

Unfortunately only Venmo G&S works for me, can't do PayPal. Willing to consider offers. Let me know if you have any questions!",1,1763598878.0,mechmarket,3,1.0,False

I won’t go into full detail, but I’ll list some examples with a few explanations. For a bit of general info though, we met back in October when I first started my job, and his job is across from mine. I go there every day for coffee in the morning and lunch on my break. He’s not always there, which is fine I’m not there just for him lol. But after our first encounter, all he would do is just full on stare at me for a few days straight. He cashed me out a few times after that, and we only really started talking like the lightest small talk the last two times. Last Thursday, however, when a customer came in, he said “what’s up mamas” in a tone that did make me a bit jealous (lol) and have me think maybe he DOESN’T feel the same way. Monday or Tuesday, while he was ringing out another customer, he kept glancing over at me, making eye contact, then looking away, rinse and repeat. This morning while grabbing coffee, he was I guess just arriving to work. We made eye contact, he said “hi!”, I said “hey!” and then he smirked/made a small smile, and that was it. I’ve never been good at knowing whether or not someone likes me or if I’m just reading too much into it, so help would be so appreciated 😭. Thank you I love you all, have a wonderful whatever time it is lol.

Just wanted to share my own (mainly for the process of sharing) as this LPR is killing me and I'm afraid of it doing so literally.

2.5 years ago... Gastritis
Starting a new desk job (sitting down for 12 hours) I was on antibiotics for a weird infection on my belly button and severe stomach pain.. in this time I was on holidays with family, eating and drinking merrily when I got COVID. I then experienced the worst heartburn of my life, debilitating on the floor screaming.. then it ended, but from the on I had acid taste in my mouth and waking up dry mouth spitting blood and brown mucus. Some fatigue. All the whole my partner was pregnant with our second baby. I was worried that cancer was doing to take me as did my father and I won't be there for my kids. I hardly had reflux again

The journey
First endoscopy come back as ""mild gastritis"" got put on PPIs (still taking them now 20mg pantoprazole in he morning). I stuck to my diet lost like 15kg (I looked sickly) but over a year I started to get more energy and stopped waking up in the night spitting blood and brown mucus. But I knew it was still there. I stayed careful.. ups n downs but nothing could prepare me for this.

The last 3 months
I was feeling ok like 80% which was my new normal then I got a bad viral cough, my whole family did but it stuck around for a month then I started waking up with burning throat, nose and tears that literally burned my face. This happened for a week before I started spitting heaps of blood and brown mucus all through the night. Waking up 4-5 times super dry and all my sinus absolutely jammed and inflamed ears aching and tears burning my face. 

Lost
I have like 20% energy and have dropped 10kgs in this and my partner says I'm starting to look sick.. and to be fair I feel like I'm dying and there's no way out.. I work away so I have burst my twice eardrums flying to and from work on a weekly basis. (I have worked out if I take Sudafed/nasal decongestant spray and eustachi device I can sometimes clear my ears on the plane). Everyday is pain. I have to work to provide for my family. I get home and my kids want to play and sometimes I lock myself in the bathroom to cry and when I leave to work I sob in the car for an hour on the way to the airport. 

Meds and food
- Pantoprazole 20mg once in the morning 30min before breakfast. (Not sure it does anything but too cared to stop)
- have tried sucralfate a year ago made me feel ill but I didn't give it long.
- tried H2 fomatidine didn't seem to do anything at the start.
- take a gut care drink daily (slipper elm, DGL, zinc, l glutamine, aloe vera) doesn't seem to do anything but taste shit.
- stopped drinking alcohol and coffee cold turkey.
- eat eggs or Greek yogurt and melon for breakfast.
- stopped breads, wheats. Gluten.
- lunch banana, chicken or mince plain with salt only, maybe root vegetables
- same as above for dinner.
- just started alkaline water and spray bicarb mix in my nose n throat 2-3x a day.
- I also try move and walk after every meal.

Help
I have another scope booked in 1 week and ENT booked in 3 weeks. Is there anything that I haven't tried or has anyone had something similar? I don't really get heartburn anymore it skips my esophagus and just burns the fuck out of every hole in my head. I feel like I'm dying and I look at my son's photo daily to help me keep going and not end it before cancer gets me as I saw my dad die from cancer and I don't want that for my kids. Save me.

1p1ovms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Episcopalian/comments/1p1ovms/i_want_to_take_part_in_my_church_and_help_out_but/,I want to take part in my church and help out but just can't get past the idea that I won't belong or won't really be wanted,"My episcopal church I've been going to on and off as I've been re-examining my faith is in an upper middle class suburban neighborhood. And, judging from just glancing around at Sunday morning service, most of the people there are those with families and kids and such, with a few older (70 and above) people also there. But the congregation size itself is decent, with most of the pews being filled each time I go. The church also of course has an undercroft and smaller chapel for kids. All in all, it seems like a nice place. 

And then there's me. A nobody with no kids, hardly any family and not even a girlfriend anymore (broke up a few weeks ago). I also have a drinking problem that's steadily been increasing for the past year or so. Do I get drunk every day? No. Do I get drunk during work? No. Have I ever gotten drunk in public? No. I'm just a sad sack kind of drunk who doesn't even have drinking buddies because I don't have any friends either. Oh, and I'm gonna be 30 next week. So that'll be fun (not). 

I just want peace within myself. Beer and whiskey lower my inhibitions and make me feel slightly euphoric, but obviously that feeling is fleeting. I also want to wake up feeling like I have something driving me, besides the next paycheck. And I see that in Christians and the people in this community. The idea that, no matter how bad things get, they'll always have their faith and the reassurance that when their time comes to check out, their loved ones passed will be waiting for them and they'll be with God. 

I want that peace and am trying to find it by reading the Bible and re-examining what I believe, trying to understand scripture more deeply, etc. But at the same time, when everyone is mingling over coffee and donuts after the worship service, I feel like I'll never really fit in with them and will always be subconsciously seen as a black sheep. That, if they really got to know me, they'd see there's nothing that interesting to know or to see. And then I'd slowly fade out and not return. 

But I guess we'll see this Sunday when I told the reverend I'd be there. If anything, I'm stubborn with commitments in that, if I tell someone I'm gonna be there, and I don't end up in the hospital or don't get caught up in other stuff, I'll usually stick to my word. I guess that's one positive about me.",6,1763598613.0,Episcopalian,4,1.0,False
1p1ot0g,https://i.redd.it/brn0g38i3b2g1.jpeg,Some McDonald's Goodies - Pt. 27 - FINAL DAYS (READ BEFORE COMMENTING),"🍟☕🥤 **Day 27 Giveaway – Final Day (I Hope!)** 🍦🥧🍟

Hey everyone! This should (hopefully) be the **final day** of my McDonald’s Giveaway series.

At this point, I only have **small items left**.  
**Sodas, coffees, fries, vanilla cones, and apple pies. That’s it.**

I’ve got around **50 offers** still available, and I’m trying to get through as many of them as possible today.

We’re down to the last couple of days before everything expires, so let’s make this count.  
**Let’s do this — we’re almost at the finish line!**

As always, **same rules apply.** If you’re new, please read everything carefully before commenting.



#  🍟How This Works

1️⃣ **Comment “Interested.”**

* Don’t request specific items — the menu and availability change constantly.
* Make it a **new top-level comment** (not a reply).
* I’ll reply with your **number in line**.
* If you can’t stay available, please comment to remove yourself so I can move faster.

2️⃣ **Unsolicited DMs = ignored.**

* I’ll contact you first when it’s your turn.

3️⃣ **Once I DM you,** you’ll have **10 minutes** to respond or I’ll move to the next person.

4️⃣ **When it’s your turn, I’ll ask:**

* The **ZIP code** of the McDonald’s you’ll pick up from
* Whether you’re using **drive-thru or counter**
* Then I’ll tell you **what’s still available**

5️⃣ **After I place your order,** I’ll send a **screenshot with your pickup code.**

6️⃣ **Reply to your original comment** once you’ve picked up your food so others know it’s legit.



# 🕒 Quick Notes

* The app sometimes glitches between states, please be patient.
* If you won’t be near a McDonald’s soon, skip this round.
* I can’t hold or guarantee specific items.



# ✅ When All Offers Are Claimed

* I’ll change the post’s flair to **“FULFILLED.”**
* If I go to bed or step away for the night, I will **still mark the post as fulfilled** at that time.
* Anyone already in line at that moment will still be completed, but I **will not take new submissions** after the post is marked.
* If I still have offers left after that, I will **post again tomorrow.**



# ⚠️ Important Reminders

* Some McDonald’s locations **don’t honor rewards** — that’s out of my control.
* Reddit doesn’t allow edits after posting, so for the latest info, **sort comments by “new.”**
* I post **timestamped updates** throughout the day showing where I am in line or if I’m taking a short break.",5,1763598426.0,Freefood,26,0.78,False
1p1osxm,https://i.redd.it/vva0e27k3b2g1.jpeg,Is Listerby being discontinued?,"Hi Everyone, I was just wondering if anybody would happen to know if the Listerby line is being discontinued. On IKEA Canada’s website they all say “Last Chance to Buy”, but when I was searching I saw that sometimes they do that when items change codes or have small changes made as well. They’re all in stock online and in my local store. 

Early this year I got the coffee table for our new apartment after having it on my wishlist for so long, and I love it. I was planning on getting the other pieces when we move into a larger space, so I’m really hoping that they won’t be going away forever. I would buy them now to put in storage, but that would not be an extremely smart financial decision for me right now if it’s not necessary.

Loving it!!! However my shots are inconsistent as I dont have a proper grinder yet. I have a spice grinder I have used for coffee with no realy setting other than push the button to grind it until it looks good. I would love a manual grinder and the K6 was recomended to me on my previous post.  I have been waiting to buy it at $99 and today my kiddo dropped the lid to the grinder I have and thus breaking it (the lid had the mechanism to push a button to grind). Went to pull the plug and buy the grinder but it is now $129. All I have found is the K6 is absolutely worth it and top notch especially for the price. I'm wanting a manual grinder specifically because I have been standing there grinding beans anyways, and I love the slow hobby of taking time to make coffee, AND I don't have space for anything big. 

Questions to ask: 
*Is the K6 worth it? 
*Should I buy the K6 at this heightened price? 
*What are some other really good manual grinders I should look into vs the K6? ",1,1763598181.0,espresso,3,0.99,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

2pm Come back to hotel to get bags

4pm Arrive JFK

1p1ofxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1p1ofxl/im_a_firstyear_r1_at_royal_blue_hospital_my/,I'm a first-year R1 at Royal Blue Hospital. My colleagues are straight up REFUSING to work on certain wards.,"I’ve always had a deep fascination with the human body. 

As a kid, I liked dissecting frogs a little too much, studying their insides, organs, and seeing how everything worked. 

That obsession carried me through college and med school and brought me here, standing over a patient, sweating and hating myself, regretting my life choices, and ultimately failing to remember everything I had been taught.

“Dr. Marks, we are waiting.”

Dr. Allison Marriott had blonde hair pinned back in a ponytail. 

She wiggled her monobrow, and I liked to imagine it came to life when she slept and crawled off her face. Mid-thirties, with deep frown lines around her lips and eyes. 

“Dr. Marks,” she barked, her tone sharp and commanding. “In front of you is a 16yo female patient complaining of abdominal pain. What do you suspect is wrong?”

The girl in question stared down at her hands. Blushing cheeks, raised heartbeat, unable to sit still. Her mother sat beside her bed, overbearing, by the look on the teen’s face. Helicopter parents were a nightmare. This wasn’t going to end well. 

Ryan, the R1 breathing down my neck, shot me a knowing look behind his clipboard. 

Dr. Marriott was temperamental.

Today, I just happened to be her target. 

“Well,” I cleared my throat, choosing my words carefully. The girl was a minor, so I glanced at her mother instead. 

A week earlier, a woman had mistook me saying “she’s grossly dilated” as being rude. 

Mothers were walking landmines. 

“First I’d get a full history and examine her. I would suspect appendicitis, ovarian torsion, or a possible ectopic pregnancy as urgent causes.” 

I eyed the mother again. 

“I’d also consider urinary tract infection, gastroenteritis, or menstrual-related pain, depending on her symptoms. Check vital signs, do a full abdominal exam, and order a pregnancy test.”

“Pregnancy test?” The woman’s voice collapsed into a shriek, and I resisted rolling my eyes. 

Her eyes fell on me like I was the one who knocked up her teenage daughter.

Unsurprisingly, Allison just shrugged, so I had to explain myself. 

I settled the mother with a patient smile. 

Two cups of lukewarm coffee and three hours of sleep wasn't enough to foster empathy. 

“It’s standard procedure, Mrs. Matthews,” I said gently. “A pregnancy test helps us rule out abnormalities.”

The woman's face turned three shades of pale, and I excused myself before I could start acting human. 

Patients expect a robot; an empty, soulless and smiling robot that will tell them everything is sunshine and rainbows. I couldn't be that. 

Abdominal issues, especially in teenage girls, always warrant a routine pregnancy test to rule out anything serious. 

So yes, while I had been correct in my approach, I was “heartless”, according to the other R1’s. 

Allison took delight in reminding me, just three inches from my face, that my most important duties as a doctor was to avoid frightening the patient. 

As a first-year residential student, Allison was basically my mother. 

The day after her lecture, Allison’s expression was unusually perky for 8am, a bounce in her step, a smile on her face, and smelling of stale coffee. 

Allison always turned her nose up when I pulled out a cigarette and lectured me about healthy choices.

Usually while demolishing her third candy bar of the day. 

She knew everything, obviously. 

If I asked questions, I was uneducated. 

If I didn’t ask questions, I was ignorant and endangering patients. 

There was no winning.

“You’re being transferred,” Allison said, like she had personally fired me. 

She handed over a stack of crumpled papers. “Effective immediately, you’re being transferred to…” She didn’t bother elaborating. 

“The city,” Allison said instead of giving me the name. 

I would later find out it was Royal Blue Hospital in the middle of nowhere, and I would be working in the maternity ward. 

There was no goodbye or good luck. 

I was expected to hand in my scrubs and my pager and leave the premises.

It felt a lot like getting fired. But the polite version. I considered protesting, but in this line of work, I had learned to keep my mouth shut and obey. It was better to keep my head down and grin and bear it. 

Finish my residency. 

Become another cog in the machine I already resented. Another hospital. 

Another set of bitchy nurses pretending I couldn’t hear them trash-talking patients. 

I’m not exaggerating when I say the worst person you know in high school will end up becoming a nurse.

The new place was impressive, modern and minimalist, towering over downtown with its checkerboard windows. 

The maternity ward had a built-in swimming pool. The automatic doors actually worked, unlike the ones that broke every five minutes at my old workplace. 

On my first day, I was told I would be lonely.

“Lonely?” I couldn't help questioning my colleagues, who only shot each other cryptic glances. They were nice enough. 

I received obligatory greetings that seemed too practised. 

Almost like each had been meticulously rehearsed. 

“It’s different this year,” one of the second-years told me as I dumped my stuff in my locker. 

His name was Dr. Harley, a surgeon several years older, with a thick four o’clock shadow and dark circles under his eyes. 

He clapped me on the shoulder with a grin, straightened his scrubs, and slipped on his lanyard, giving himself a quick once-over in the mirror. 

“Don’t worry, you’ll be fine. It just takes some time to get used to.” 

As he brushed past me, his breath fluttered my ear. “Believe it or not, this place is actually *haunted*.” 

When I walked into the residential lounge for my first meeting, I expected an empty room—or worse, to be outcast. 

But I was pleasantly surprised.

An empty box of sushi hit me squarely in the face upon opening the door, and I came to an unsure halt. 

It felt like walking into a game. 

A woman was halfway across the room, mid-yell and laughing, while the offender stood on a Craigslist couch, brandishing an empty soda can like a weapon. 

Another guy rolled his eyes behind a book, unimpressed. 

The thrower, a fuzzy redhead, crossed the room in a single stride.

“Time out!” he shouted, glaring at the woman. Then his eyes landed on me. 

“Yooo, we’ve got a newbie,” he announced, reaching for my hand. His fingers were refreshingly cool. “Sup! I’m Dr. Matthews, but call me Will.”

He pointed to the others. “That’s Dr. Carlisle and Dr. Faraway.”

The girl shot me a grin, dropping the sushi lid. “There’s no need for formalities,” she said, her smile bright. She reminded me of a human golden retriever, with long brown hair and wide eyes, no dark circles, not even a hint of exhaustion. 

“Just Olivia is fine,” she trilled, “Hey there!”

“Jake,” the other R1 muttered. A freckled blond with a ponytail and his feet propped on the table. 

He didn’t even glance up from his notes. I’d already pegged him as the smart-ass. “Welcome to Hell.”

A senior official stepped in, taking in the chaos of the room. 

His eyes locked on me despite the over two very clearly in battle mode. 

“Dr. Marks,” an older man with greying hair and crumbs in his beard, introduced himself as Dr. Lan, arms crossed. 

He didn’t bother looking at the others; he probably didn’t need to. “Let’s keep things professional.” 

He nodded at me to toss the sushi tray. “You’re in the workplace now,” he said. “Act like it.”

“You’re in the *workplace* now,” Will mimicked under his breath, exaggerating Dr. Lan’s Southern drawl. Jake smirked, and Olivia ducked her head, giggling behind her notes. These three were a riot.

Dr. Lan’s gaze suddenly shot to Will, his expression twisting, eyes narrowing. 

Maybe the sun was in his eyes. Will was standing directly in front of the window. 
“Is something *funny*, Dr. Matthews?”

Jake’s eyes widened, his gaze snapping to our superior. “What?” 

Dr. Lan wasn’t messing around. “Perhaps you want to share your hilarious joke with the rest of us?”

Will ducked his head, hugging his arms around himself. “I apologize, Dr. Lan. I acted unprofessionally.”

“Will—” Jake hissed, but Will jabbed him in the gut. Olivia shot him a death glare.

I detected some kind of rebellion against our superiors. 

Not something I’d expect in a workplace. 

These people were in their late twenties. This wasn’t high school. 

Dr. Lan’s gaze lingered on the two of them for a moment before he twisted and yanked open the door. He didn’t scold, but he didn’t need to. His expression said it all. 

“Dr. Marks, please follow me.” 

I found myself nodding and falling in step. 

“Don’t expect me to wait. Stay by my side and do not ask stupid questions, and I will tolerate you. You will be working on the paediatric ward with me today.”  

I followed him out of the residential lounge, the other R1s joining in step. 

My morning went just as I thought. I was expected to observe. 

The four of us stood around a child propped up on pillows in the paediatric ward. “Dr. Marks,” Dr. Lan called on me, of course.  “how would you manage mild dehydration in this two-year-old patient?”

Next to me, Will spoke up. He was surprisingly intelligent, considering his antics. “Uh, well, first I’d start with a 20 ml isotonic saline bolus, then reassess, and continue oral rehydration once stable.”

Lan ignored him. “Dr. Marks. I ask you a question, I expect you to answer it.”

I panicked and blurted Will’s response in a string of word vomit I immediately tried to swallow. “20 ml of isotonic bolus and reassess until stable.” 

Dr. Lan folded his arms. “Good. And if the patient’s condition deteriorates?” 

“Evaluate for underlying causes and conduct frequent assessment of urine output,” Olivia stated, lifting her head. 

I noticed Olivia had a little quirk: she tightened her ponytail whenever she answered a question. 

Will, on the other hand, fidgeted constantly, playing with his pen, or twirling a single strand of his hair.  

Jake was stiff. Robotic. Cool as a cucumber.

“If they’re deteriorating, I’d escalate care,” he added. 

His response was to-the-point, his gangly sandy blonde frame partially hidden behind Olivia. “I’d reassess immediately, repeat fluids if needed, and escalate to ICU support if they don’t improve.”

“Dr. Marks,” Lan barked. “What is required if the patient’s condition worsens?” 

Why was I the only one being lectured?

I flailed, catching Jake’s smirk. He was enjoying this. Being ignored. Something about it thrilled him. 

“Urine output,” I panicked, clearing my throat. “Monitor urine output, evaluate underlying causes, and repeat fluids.”

It was obvious I was just parroting my colleagues. 

But Dr. Lan didn’t even raise an eyebrow. “Correct.”

Will nudged me with a grin when we moved to the next patient.  “Someone’s popular!” 

“Dr. Lan,” one of our patients, a seven-year-old with cystic fibrosis, looked up from his DS. “Will is a good doctor,” he pulled a face. “Why do you keep ignoring him?”

Will strode over to the kid, ruffling his hair. “Ignore Dr. Lan,” he teased. “He’s got favorites.""

By the end of the day, the other three fully abandoned me to all duties. I had watched three deliveries and witnessed an infant’s death. 

A teenage girl was rushed in and gave birth to twins before bleeding out on the surgical bed. She was fifteen. I was the one who broke it to her father.

I was alone, exhausted, frustrated, every muscle aching, with no one to help. 

I paged Will over and over, but his pager didn’t go through. 

Olivia and Jake were nowhere to be found. 

Dr. Harley brought me coffee on our way down to surgery. 

“Have you seen Dr. Matthews?” I asked him, burning my tongue when I gulped it down. “I can't page him.”

“Matthews?” He frowned. His expression slackened. “Shouldn't you know that?”

“It's my first day,” I smiled through a grimace. “I barely know him.” 

Dr. Harley dumped his own coffee. “Upstairs,” he said. His tone hardened. “Focus, Dr. Marks.” 

By midnight, I was running on autopilot, the ward overflowing, with maybe five minutes to spare.

I crashed into the residential lounge hoping to finish the sandwich I left on the table. The light flickered on and I almost jumped out of my skin. 

Will was cross-legged on his laptop. 

Olivia was snoozing on the temporary bed they had set up, and Jake sat staring into oblivion. 

“Yooo, newbie.” Will looked up from his laptop, grinning. “How was your first day?”

“Where were you?” I demanded. “You’ve been MIA all night, leaving me to handle everything!” 

Will’s smile bled away. His gaze dropped. “Busy,” he said.

“Busy?” I shot back. I slumped into a chair, eyeing the sandwich. I gave it an experimental sniff and stuffed it in my mouth. “You’ve been slacking off.”

“Grace,” Jake muttered, shooting me a glare. “Shut up. You have no idea what you’re talking about.”

My blood boiled. I spat out the sandwich. “What?”

“We can’t go onto certain wards,” Olivia mumbled into her pillow, rolling over. “We’re not allowed.”

I laughed, even though I knew I shouldn’t. “You’re not serious.” My head spun as I stepped forward. 

I fought back a screech, but the words burst out anyway, bubbling on my tongue like soda pop. “You can’t just leave me to handle everything alone!”

Olivia was sitting up now, legs swinging off the bed. She swiped at her eyes. Was she actually crying?

I turned to Jake. He seemed like the only one with any backbone. 

“Were you in here this whole time?” I gestured toward Will, who slammed the laptop shut, looking suddenly sheepish. 

“I’ve been downstairs watching children bleed out in front of me, and you’ve been up here playing Minecraft?”

Jake stood up, hands in his pockets, and strode over, stopping just three inches from my face.

“Grace,” he said quietly, his voice dropping into a low growl. “You’ve crossed the line.”

“Is it connections?” I demanded, breathless. I knew I was crossing a line, going way too far, but I couldn’t stay calm and emotionless any longer. 

I was too fucking human to be a nurse. I couldn’t just smile, grin, and bear it. 

“You’re rich kids with powerful parents. You don’t have to play by the rules. Is that why I can’t even talk about you?”

I couldn’t resist a bitter laugh as I stepped closer. 

Jake’s breath brushed my cheek, but he didn’t back down. His eyes narrowed.

 “Like I said,” he grunted. “You have no idea what you’re talking about, Grace.”

“You three think you own this hospital,” I spat. “It’s all a power play. You’ve got connections that let you get away with murder, slack off, and play your little games, while I’m left holding the pieces! You snap your fingers, and the higher-ups roll over. Is that it? What are you, nepo babies?”

Jake folded his arms over his scrubs. “So what if we *are*?” He stepped closer, teasing his proximity. 

“What if we *are* abusing our positions and terrorizing our colleagues?” His lips curled into a smirk. “What exactly are you going to do about it?”

“Jake.” Will’s voice cut through me, cold, like splintered glass. 

His frenzied eyes found mine, a and a sliver of ice trickled down my spine. 

“We’re not nepo babies,” he looked away. “It’s… complicated.”

“Complicated.” I repeated. I turned to Olivia, who was silent, staring down at her lap. “Then explain! Tell me why you disappeared for nine hours—”

I didn’t realize I was shouting until the door opened and Dr. Lan stepped inside. 

He was holding a small bag, swinging it between his fingers. 

“Dr. Marks,” he said sharply, but his expression immediately softened. 

He sighed, and instead of scolding me, he motioned for me to follow. 

“Come with me.” 

“Dr Lan,” I managed to choke out. “The others—”

“Now.” 

The trio trailed behind as I was led on a walk of shame. 

Dr. Lan didn’t take me to his office. Instead, he stepped into an elevator and motioned for us to follow. Olivia hesitated, stepping back, but Jake tugged her inside. “I don’t understand,” I whispered as Dr. Lan led me down a long, winding corridor. 

It was too quiet. My steps felt heavy, my breath shallow, as we passed through a swinging door and into the sharp smell of antiseptic.

Soft, rhythmic beeps sliced through an otherwise silent ward. 

I looked at Dr. Lan for some kind of direction, but to my surprise, he wasn't there for work purposes. 

He produced a bouquet of flowers from the bag and strode towards the patient on the far side of the room. My gaze dropped to the patients.

One of them made my heart lurch. I felt myself unravel, coming apart, body, mind and soul at once until I couldn't breathe, until every breath felt forced, my lungs fighting for oxygen. I sensed my body falling, my knees hitting ice cold porcelain.

But I was still standing, legs wobbling, stomach twisting. 

Will.

He lay there, hooked up to monitors, surrounded by a mix of fresh and rotting flowers. His eyes were closed, his skin sickly pale. 

I felt myself backing away instinctively. There was no escape. 

The walls pressed in, too clinical, too white, too wrong. This couldn’t be real. My hands ripped at my ponytail. 

I spent the whole day with them. 

I talked to them. 

Olivia lay on his left, a halo of dark curls spilling across the pillows. 

Jake’s face was covered beneath a plastic mask.

Dr. Lan hovered over Will, checking his vitals and gently fluffing his hair.

“Our R1s were in a serious accident a few months ago,” he said quietly. 

“While transferring a patient to another hospital, there was a crash. We thought they might survive, but over the last few weeks, we had to induce a coma. They were declared brain dead yesterday.""

He moved slowly to Will’s bed, arranging flowers beside him, then to Jake’s, picking up get-well cards and reading each carefully. 

“William was the only doctor who questioned me,” he murmured, smiling at the empty space where Will stood beside me. 

“Olivia was a wonderful nurse. That girl would have gone far in medicine.” 

I pretended not to hear Olivia sniffling behind me.

“And Jacob,” Dr. Lan finished. Jake’s eyes flicked to me, mouth curving into a scowl. 

I was certain he hadn't forgotten the nepo baby comment. “An old soul trapped in a young body. Book smart and popular with female patients.”

Lan sighed. “We will be taking them off oxygen soon,” he said, his voice slipping back into professional calm. Then he met my eyes. “I believe they are at their end, holding on.”

“That’s a lie,” Jake snapped, the words slicing through the fragile calm. He slumped beside his own body, glaring at the doctor. “He can definitely see us.”

“He obviously can’t,” Olivia said, wiping at her red, swollen eyes. “Dr. Lan looks right through us.”

Will didn’t answer. He kept casting uneasy glances at his motionless body.

“Dr. Lan,” I whispered.

My voice broke on the last word, sharp and humiliating.

Too human. I barely registered that I was staring at empty air, speaking to empty air. 

I had been talking to my imagination all day. A sour burn crawled up my throat. “I need to go to the bathroom.”

Dr. Lan’s eyes lingered on Will’s body. “Go ahead.”

Will stepped in front of me. “Grace,” he said.

I shook my head. “I need to get out of here.”

“We were waiting for your shift to end,” he whispered. “We didn’t expect Dr. Lan to show up.”

I shoved past him. He felt physical, warm, real. His skin was clammy. 

His coat was real, brushing my fingertips. 

How had I missed the warning signs? 

How could I have been so stupid, so careless?

“Get away from me,” I choked out, then remembered he wasn’t actually there. “I’m okay. I just need air.”

“Dr. Marks.” Dr. Lan’s voice startled me. “Please keep this confidential for the time being. The only ones who know are the family and hospital staff.”

“What?” Will strode over, standing directly in front of him.  “What does that mean?”

*“It means our deaths weren't an accident,” Jake spoke up.

*“Can you not say that?” Olivia squeaked. “He said it was a crash!” 

I barely registered the trio’s conversation as it bounced around me, collapsing into white noise.

With permission, I staggered out of the ward, my head spinning. 

I barely reached the girls’ bathroom before collapsing to my knees, my forehead thudding against the ice-cold toilet seat as vomit-tasting sobs racked my chest. 

By the time my stomach was empty, I was shaking with exhaustion.

I was going crazy.

“And you thought we were *nepo babies*.”

The voice froze my blood. The flash of light blue scrubs was unmistakable. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a familiar figure sitting with his knees pulled to his chest, arms wrapped around them. 

Dr. Jake Faraway. 

Mr. Dead the whole time. 

I didn’t turn around. My hands clung to the toilet seat, my breath coming out in a shaky rush. 

Guilt was already tearing me apart from screaming at him earlier. 

His ghost showing up in the girls’ bathroom to hammer it in was just cruel.  

“I didn’t know,” I managed, my voice catching, choking on bile making its reappearance. “I’m sorry.”

“Don't flatter yourself. I didn’t follow you for an apology,” he muttered into his knees. 

“So, you've come to gloat,” the words spewed from my mouth before I could stop them.

He laughed. “About what? Being dead? You couldn’t have known. When I first woke up, I didn’t realize anything was wrong. Not until I tried to go home and bam—I was smack back in the hospital.” 

Jake shot me a rare smile. “I like to think the residential lounge is like our respawning point.” 

“You didn’t see your body?” I asked.

He exhaled. “Nope. But there was a lot happening on the ICU ward. I figured we had critical patients.”

“Who were…” I swallowed my words.

Jake sighed, nuzzling into his knees and turning his head to look at me. He offered a sickly smile. 

“Imagine my shock when I follow my colleagues to see what the hell is going on, and I see my own dumbass getting cardiopulmonary resuscitation.”

His expression twisted, and for a moment, I thought he might show real emotion, brows furrowing, lip curling, like he was about to cry but had trained himself not to. 

Jake was good at suppressing it. 

Unlike me, he could hide his humanity. 

The perfect doctor. 

“They brought me in first,” he said, closing his eyes. “Then Will and Olivia, who were in pretty bad shape. I found them in the resident lounge, and they thought I was messing around. I was like, no man, seriously, you are literally getting life-saving surgery downstairs.”

“They didn’t believe you,” I said.

He groaned, tilting his head back, eyes scanning the ceiling. “Would you?” 

His gaze flicked to me. “Imagine if we told you when you first came in. ‘Hi, Grace! Nice to meet you! By the way, we’re actually comatose upstairs, and you’re talking to our ghosts!’”

Nausea curled deep in my gut. 

I turned away, rested my head against the toilet seat, and squeezed my eyes shut. “Why *did* you follow me?”

“I lied.” I could hear the smirk in his voice. “I was fishing for an apology.”

“Asshole,” I muttered.

“In my defence, you did call us nepo babies,” he said. 

I swallowed my argument. “We’re in a hospital, so there has to be more like you.” I choked into ice-cold porcelain. “Are there others on… that side?”

Jake didn't reply for a moment. “Kids, mainly.”

“Kids?” 

“Yeah,” he mumbled into his knees. “The pediatric ward is full of them. Kids who have nowhere to go. Will keeps them company. That’s where he was.”

“But I didn’t see him—”

He cut me off. “You won’t see us all the time. You act like it’s our fault when we slip past your perception. We were in the pediatric ward all day. We saw the girl die, and we couldn’t help you.”

“I’m sorry,” I said, instead of calling myself out.

He groaned. “You apologize a lot. Seriously. Stop doing that.”

I held my breath. “Can I ask you a question?”

“Shoot.”

“Do you think you’ll stay?” I whispered. “When they switch off your oxygen.”

He didn’t respond. The stall suddenly felt cavernous. Lonely.

When I finally risked a glance around, Dr. Jake Faraway had disappeared.

***

I was half expecting the residents’ lounge to be empty when I crashed into it during a quiet period. 

“Hi,” I said to the empty room. “I'm sorry about earlier.” 

Ghosts were never quiet. They were just more annoying humans. 

Will was back at the table, greeting me with an over-the-top grin. This guy didn't know subtlety.

His messy red curls still threw me off, unless he’d looked like that when he died. 

His white coat was thrown over pale blue scrubs. 

I wondered why he was still wearing his work clothes. Olivia was sprawled across the couch, and Jake sat cross-legged on the floor like he was meditating.

I shut the door so I wouldn’t appear crazy.

I had a lot of questions.

After finding out my colleagues weren’t just dead but upstairs clinging to life, I’d freaked out at them like it was somehow their fault. 

If I wanted answers before I lost them for good, now was the time. 

I dropped into a seat at the table, pointedly ignoring Olivia, who was hanging upside down on the couch like a bored bat. 

“So, you guys are actually brain-dead upstairs, and you're stuck in the hospital you worked at,” I said.

“Basically!” Will shot me a grin. “I don’t believe in paranormal crap, and there’s no scientific explanation except one vague, hypothetical theory. Pure conjecture.” 

He propped his chin on his fist. 

“Sooooo, back in 2008, there was this case where a woman claimed she was in a coma but could walk around her ward and talk to other coma patients.” 

His eyes met mine, lips pricking. “So maybe when we died, our consciousness sort of jumped out of our bodies. Like a projection. And that's what we are.”

“Will.” Jake cracked one eye open, exasperated. “We’re not projections. You're an idiot.” 

Dr. Jake Faraway was the younger, long suffering, and apparently deader House.

His permanent frown lines and narrowed eyes made him a real joy to be around. 

Twenty-eight years old with the personality of a boomer. Will was sunshine and theories, Jake was cold logic. Olivia was the depressed glue holding them together.

“We’re ghosts,” Jake said flatly. The words curled on his tongue bubbled with finality. 

“There's no other explanation. We're dead. We’re not coming back. When they turn us off upstairs, we will die.”

Will rolled his eyes. “You don't know that. What if we wake up?”

Jake smacked him playfully over the head. “What part of *brain-dead* do you not understand?”

It sounded like a debate they had had a hundred times before.

Jake exhaled, eyes closing again, like Will wasn't a colleague but a child. 

He shifted onto his butt.  “Ignore him. His amnesia is making him optimistic.”

“Amnesia?” I asked, wandering to the fridge. Inside were beer, water, and expired pasta. 

I grabbed an orange instead and dropped back into my seat. My pager buzzed again. 

I ignored it, popping a slice into my mouth. “So you can’t remember how you died.” 

Jake abandoned his meditation and joined us, this time sitting on the table.

“None of us can,” Jake said. “Just what Dr. Lan told you. That we were transporting a patient.” 

He tilted his head. “Which is strange, because R1s usually don’t get that responsibility. It doesn’t make sense they would trust first-years with transportation.”

Olivia appeared in the chair opposite me, a blur of dark curls and smeared eyeliner. 

She gave me a faint smile, her eyes frantically following my hands as I peeled the orange. Did ghosts get hungry?

I offered her a piece, and she almost took it before shooting me a sheepish smile.

I slipped another piece of orange into my mouth.

“They didn’t even tell me about your accident. I had to find out for myself.” I glanced at Will, who avoided my gaze. 

“You guys had me talking to myself and didn’t mention anything until I saw your---” I refused to say bodies, “your real selves.”

Jake nodded, chin on fist. “That’s a good question. Why didn’t the hospital report it?”

Will rocked in his seat, head tilted back. “That's sus, right? Why didn't they tell anyone else?” 

He suddenly jerked upright with a hiss. “Fuck. This isn’t a Ghost situation, is it? Is that why we’re here?""

""Do we have to remember the accident to come to terms with our deaths, and then we step into a bright light and fade away to Whitney Houston?” 

Jake groaned, burying his face in his arms. “You're driving me insane.” 

“Maybe I don’t want to move on.” 

Will’s lip jutted into a pout. “If this is all easily explained, then when they switch off our oxygen, we’ll just disappear and just like, not exist,” he said, shuddering, “forever.”

“What if we weren’t transporting a patient?” Jake said abruptly, his head snapping up. 

He slammed his fist on the desk. Will almost flew out of his chair and Olivia shot him a glare. 

Will leaned across the table, pressing a finger gently between his eyes. “Explain, Jacob.”

Jake’s gaze flicked to him, clinical, sharp, and strangely alive with both excitement and fear. “What else do we transport that’s not patients?”

I knew the answer before Will could open his mouth. 

Something, like a spider’s leg, crawled down my spine. 

“Organs,” I said to an empty table. 

I had been staring at Olivia’s wide, searching eyes, her parted lips looking for an answer. 

Then, without a word, she flashed out of existence. 

I shook my head, blinking rapidly. I turned to the others, meeting dead air. 

The three of them were gone.

My pager buzzed: Code Blue. Floor 3. ICU. 

My stomach dropped, adrenaline spiking, muscles tensing for fight or flight. 

I could hear the soft patter of nurses rushing by, alarms shrieking from upstairs, but I couldn’t move. The door slammed open. Dr. Harley’s head appeared. “Dr. Marks, we need you in the ICU. Code Blue.”

I followed him, tripping over myself as we dashed up the stairs.

There was already a congregation of staff outside the closed door. “It’s our R1s,” Dr. Harley told me, pushing through the crowd. 

“They’ve flatlined.” His voice splintered. “We’re doing everything we can, but it’s serious.”

I stopped dead. Somehow, I reached out and grabbed him, yanking him back.

“They’re brain dead,” I whispered. “If you declared them brain dead, why are you trying to save them?”

“She’s right.” Jake appeared in front of him, arms folded, a faint, feathered glow outlining him. 

Jake stepped close, until the two were nose to nose. “We’re brain dead.” He stated. “Why *are* you trying to save us?” 

Dr. Harley turned to me, lips curling into a practiced smile. 

He yanked me away from the crowd, his fingernails digging into my skin. 

“Stop talking,” he hissed under his breath. 

“Do your job, and keep your mouth shut.” His eyes were hollow, like staring into twin stars. “Do you understand me?”

""Yes,"" I whispered, ignoring the ghost's rolled eyes.

“Stay here,” Dr. Harley snapped at me, shoving me back before forcing his way into the room.

Jake stayed with me, avoiding my gaze. 

He stared down at his feet for way too long, before it hit me. He was dead.

“Will and Olivia?” I spoke under my breath.

He exhaled. “Saying goodbye to their parents.

He slumped to the floor, his sigh breaking into another sob. 

Jake surprised me with a wet, shaky sob. “Do you know what my biggest first-world problem was before I died?” 

He didn’t wait for an answer. 

“I liked someone who didn’t like me back,"" Jake hummed, smiling. ""And for a moment I actually wished I were fucking dead.” 

I didn't expect him to break.

It was real vulnerability, real emotion. Pulling his knees to his chest, Jake hid his face. “My dad’s not coming, and my mom only agreed to take me off oxygen so she could fly back to Australia. Will and Olivia died with their families around them.” 

He gave a sharp, humorless laugh. “I died alone.”

I sank down beside him, fighting the urge to give an awkward pat to the air between us.

“Then why…” I started, trailing off. 

“Why are we still here?” He let his head flop onto my shoulder. Jake was comfortably warm. “Beats me.”

The two of us sat in peaceful silence, and I revelled in his ability to accept the inevitable. Dr. Harley stepped out of the room eventually, his eyes visibly red.

“Crocodile tears,” Jake muttered.

“Dr. Matthews, Faraway, and Carlisle have passed,” he said quietly. “They’ve called it.”

I stepped into the room, and Jake followed reluctantly, sticking close to my side. 

Will and Olivia stood by their empty beds, arms wrapped tightly around each other. 

After a moment, Jake moved toward them, slowly, like he was fighting against his own emotions, before he gave in, pulling the two into a hug and burying his head in Will’s chest.

My legs somehow worked, and I stepped outside.

I figured I would leave them alone. 

They were going to disappear soon, and I was not ready for that kind of goodbye. 

I barely knew them, yet somehow they felt closer than friends. 

Their presence had been better than that of any colleague I had at my old job. 

I went back to work, ignoring whispers among the patients of the R1's deaths. 

I glimpsed Will sitting with one of the cancer patients, a terminally ill five-year-old. 

The child was talking animatedly, and Will had a book open on his lap. He shot me a grin, and I managed one back.

“Have you seen Liv?” He called over, turning a page.

Instead of responding, I shook my head. 

My night shift flew by, and before I knew it, the sun was rising. 

Which was crazy because I felt like I'd lived a lifetime. 

Two surgeries and three kids almost flatlining. 

Will flashed in and out of my perception. 

Sometimes he was doing cartwheels to make the little kids laugh, and then he was nowhere to be seen, leaving his little fans restless. 

By the time I dived onto the temporary bed in the residents lounge, I was ready to sleep and never wake up.

“Hey.” 

Someone had other plans, a certain ghost hovering over me with boundary issues.

His breath prickled the back of my neck. 

I didn’t move, burying my head in warm pillows. “Go away.”

“Grace,” Jake prodded my cheek.

I hissed, pulling the blankets over myself. “Can you take your paranormal melodrama somewhere else and let me *sleep*?”

He withdrew his finger. “Someone’s cranky.”

“I’ve been up all night,” I mumbled. “Why are you still here?”

Jake sighed and, to my surprise, flopped down beside me. “No idea. Will seems pretty happy we’re not fading away. He’s spending time with the kids.”

“And you?” My eyes were already drooping, but  my heart was flipping over in my chest. Jake’s expression was surprisingly soft. And I wasn't used to soft.  

His half lidded eyes held mine and he shifted closer. So close, I could count each individual freckle on his nose. “What are you going to do?”

Jake froze when we were nose to nose, before rolling into his back. “Oh. Yeah, no. I'm not into that.” 

I retracted, a wave of heat spreading across my cheeks. “Into what?”

His lips curved into an uncharacteristic grin. “You seriously want to fuck a ghost?” He raised an eyebrow. “Is that even anatomically possible?” 

Jake’s gaze drifted to the ceiling. “If I were alive, yeah, I’d probably have shameless sex with someone I’ve known for barely a day. Sure.” His lips twisted into a smirk. 

“Hell, I’d probably cheat after a few days and fuck an older nurse anyway.”

“Can I ask you a question?” I asked. 

His smile was unexpectedly warm. “Sure.” 

“Before you died,” I said. “Did you often get punched in the face?” 

Jake didn't seem to find the funny side, and curled up. “I’m going to sleep. I don’t feel great.”

His words jolted me to a sitting position. “Meaning?”

“Meaning I don’t feel great,” he groaned. “What else?”

Then he sat up suddenly, eyes blinking open. “Where’s Olivia?” 

“Dr. Marks.”

I hadn’t realized the door was open. My head snapped towards the threshold. Dr. Harley stood looking bewildered. His eyes were still noticeably red from crying. “Who are you talking to?”

Jake shot me a sidelong glance. “Connor’s going to tell everyone you see dead people,” he muttered. 

“I remember when I started, he claimed I left a scalpel inside a patient. I had to prove I wasn’t incompetent. I almost lost my job.” His eyes narrowed. “He bullied Will for weeks just for calling him out during surgery. Don’t trust this asshole.” 

“Grace,” Dr. Harley said, his brows furrowed. He noticed me tossing glances at the empty space next to me. “Are you doing okay?”

While I fumbled for an excuse, the man sighed. “Go home. It’s been a long shift. Get some rest, all right?” 

His gaze lingered on the spot where Jake sat before he turned off the light and left the room.

“Olivia,” Jake said, diving off the bed. “Where is she?”

I followed him out the door—or through the door—in his case. “I haven’t seen her since you guys—”

Jake’s pace quickened, his doctor’s coat swishing behind him.

Dr. Jacob Faraway wasn’t dodging the House allegations.

“Since we flatlined,” he said, passing straight through a patient. “So, she’s moved on? Seen the light?”

I passed a nurse who gave me a tired smile. I nodded back and reminded myself to keep my voice low. “So, where exactly are we going?” I whispered.

Jake broke into a run. “She’s probably with her body.”

We took the stairs down to the morgue, slipping through the door. 

I had to steady myself before stepping inside. 

I was a nurse. 

I knew bodies, insides, the wiggly bits of human anatomy. 

What I didn’t know was how to grieve. How to come face to face with their bodies. 

I froze on the threshold as Jake staggered back, his eyes wide and wild. 

Jake dropped to his knees, heaving. 

“Don’t.” He wiped his mouth. “Don’t fucking go in there.” His voice broke around the words, and something cold, something slimy, slid down my spine. “Please.”

Ignoring him, I pushed my way in.

Blinding light slammed into my eyes. 

A surgical table. Metal instruments gleaming. Several masked doctors clustered around a body. 

I saw the limp hand, the restraints pinning down the limbs, the halo of dark brown curls spread across the clinical silver. 

It didn’t click. 

Not until a raw cry curled in my throat. 

Not until I saw the hollowed-out torso of a body splayed across sterile steel. 

Her lungs were visibly protruding through the thoracic cavity, while the stomach and kidneys had been carefully excised and placed in a sterile container.  

But her body was still moving, lungs still inflating, eyelids flickering. Olivia was still alive. 

“Dr. Marks.”

Lan, the lead surgeon, frowned at me behind his mask. “Please wear appropriate attire when observing a surgery.” 

His gaze flicked back to Olivia. “Is the patient’s heart ready for excision?”

“Where am *I*?” Jake broke down behind me. I didn't realize he'd followed me. 

His wild eyes found mine. “I remember what happened. We were transporting living patients for organ removal. When we realized, Will tried to—” he trailed off, his lips curling into a monstrous snarl.  

“That bastard attacked and knocked us out.”

He lunged forward, a whirlwind sending instruments  clattering across the floor. 

Bewildered doctors stumbled away from Olivia’s body.

Jake collapsed into sobs. “If I'm alive, where am I?” He wailed. “Where's Will?” 

Lan ignored the commotion. 

His gaze flicked to me. “Dr. Marks, this is standard procedure.” He gestured to Olivia’s body. 

“We’re keeping this confidential, but we are experiencing an organ shortage. Nobody is willing to donate, so do it ourselves. With ICU patients, we mimic a flatline and transport those viable for procurement.” 

His lips pinched into a smile behind his mask, when Jake let out a raw shriek, and sent scalpels flying. 

“Do not be concerned,” Lan said, his gloved hands coated in blood. “Dr. Carlisle remains fully conscious and responsive. Her awareness constitutes informed consent for complete organ procurement.” 

His gaze landed *on* Jake, a subtle, triumphant expression crossing his face. 

This was not standard protocol. 

This was shutting them up.

I did not have this issue with concerta or adderall! I can hear my stomach rumbling all day from being hungry but literally cannot eat I end up gagging or spitting out my food. 

Also, I don’t know if it’s making me more hyper? I’ve been cleaning and feel the constant need to do something and keep busy instead of just being in bed. Also time has been going by so slow for me on vyvanse. Yesterday I cleaned for like 2 hours and it felt like I cleaned for 6 hours.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I have a DeLonghi Rivelia (without the milk container) and it has been turning on by itself randomly at night.

I work from home, and I don’t notice this happening during the day.

The other day it was 4 a.m. when it turned on; it wakes up the whole house because it makes a lot of noise. Today it was 11 p.m. and it did it again.

Any idea why this happens?

Right now the solution is too disconnect power plug and connect again in the morning for the first coffee.

9am Get bagels & coffee (close to hotel in lower manhattan)

2pm Come back to hotel to get bags

4pm Arrive JFK

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

In regards to MBTI, I first tested as INTJ during my teens and continued to primarily test as it into my 30s. More recently, I sometimes get INFJ. I've also gotten INTP and ISTJ before.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

People are complaining about their sandwiches not being cut in half - even though those sandwiches have never been cut in half - and how they suffer every time they go to Tim Hortons - and how intense their suffering is every time they go.

But, why not, change what you order, or simply, not go?

If you don't like the taste of a particular donut, why not, get a different donut?

Curiously, these last few days I've been saturated with sugary things, so much so that my stomach turns just looking at them. And honestly, I don't remember asking Asmodeus to help me with my willpower to do so, but I find it curious that in the last few days I've been saturated with it, in addition to the fact that I was planning to do it this coming week.

Another thing is that I've been losing things temporarily. I usually wear jewelry, such as bracelets, rings, necklaces, and bangles. I don't remember losing my rings so often when I go to sleep, but lately I've woken up with one or two rings missing, and in fact there was one that I lost for almost a whole day. No matter how much I searched where I sleep, I didn't find it until I got home. 

And just the day before yesterday, in addition to losing a hair tie that I definitely couldn't find, I lost a silver earring. The earrings I usually wear are studs, but without realizing it and purely on instinct, I touched my ear and realized I no longer had it (specifically, it was the right earring that I lost). The truth is that I was scared because they are the only silver earrings I have and I like how they look on me. For part of the day, I wondered where it could be and feared I had lost it on the street. I checked my hair over and over again, hoping it had gotten caught in it, and that's why I wore my hair down all morning and all afternoon, but I couldn't find it. 

In the evening, I searched the whole house and ended up resigning myself to the fact that I had lost it or that it might turn up at some point, so I decided to take off the spare and put it on Asmodeus' altar... Only 30 seconds passed, 30 seconds after I went down to the kitchen and felt something fall and hit me. I turned around and, reflexively, looked at the floor, and there was my earring, at my feet. Honestly, I was in shock and even laughed because I had been looking for it all day, and even when I changed clothes, I hoped it would turn up in case it had gotten caught on them, but it didn't, but there it was, in plain sight.

I was very surprised at how quickly it appeared shortly after I left the other pair on the altar, and honestly, I didn't hesitate to give Asmodeus some wine and dragon's blood incense as a thank you, because, in my opinion, there's no doubt that he threw it at me because he had no one else nearby.

Lately, I don't know what he's up to with these kinds of acts, among other things that have been happening to me, but every day that passes, he always surprises me with something.

But if there are things like that and others that make me wonder if he's testing me, or just playing with me, or I don't know what he has in mind with those attitudes, but I find it curious 🤔.

1p1nrsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p1nrsy/aita_for_wanting_to_move_out_because_my_roomates/,\AITA for wanting to move out because my roomates views are to much for me?,"so me and this guy Kenneth share an apartment. its a 2 bedroom in a big city near the university. hes not my boyfriend or nothing we just needed a roomate to split the rent and he answered my add. hes older then me and goes to the grad school here. hes very smart and reads alot of books. 

at first i thought it was cool because he is so different from anyone i knew back home. he talks about philosophy and society and stuff. but its gotten real weird. he is very very open about everything. like everything. he says that rules and morals are a cage and he is the locksmith. he says that stuff a lot. he has these parties sometimes and his friends are all the same way. they talk about breaking down barriers and stuff. his friend keith is always there agreeing with everything he says. 

the big thing is his views on people and bodies. he thinks that we should just do whatever feels good because its our 'evolutionary destiny' or something. he says that our bodies are just tools for pleasure. he talks about porn all the time not like a normal guy but like its a political statement. he says the most extreme stuff is the most 'pure' because it breaks the most rules. 

yesterday i came home early from my shift at the coffee shop and he was in the living room on his laptop. i could see what he was watching and it was not normal stuff. it was people doing things i cant even write here. it made me feel sick to my stomach. i just stood there for a second and he saw me. he didnt even try to hide it. he just smiled and said 'dont be shy. this is the purest form of truth. the things they used to call unspeakable'. 

he was wearing these really tight pants that showed off his legs and everything else and he was just sitting there like it was nothing. it made me so uncomfortable. 

i told him i didnt want to see that stuff in our living room. he got real serious and told me i was 'in denial' and that i was clinging to 'outdated morality'. he said 'why shy away from the primal? our bodies are mere vessels, tools for pleasure. the more we indulge, the more we shed the shackles of outdated morality. evolution demands it!'. he made me feel so stupid and small. like i was some kind of hick who just dont get it. 

so later that night i told him i think i need to move out. i told him his lifestyle is just to much for me and it makes me uncomfortable. he didnt get mad. he just looked at me real sad and said he was 'disappointed' in me. he said he thought i was more evolved then that and that i was letting my 'cultural programming' hold me back. 

now i feel real bad. he made it seem like im the one with the problem. like im a bad person for not being ok with the things he believes. he pays his rent on time and he keeps the place clean so i dont have a real reason to be mad other then i just dont like how he is. am i the asshole for wanting to move out and basically making him feel judged for his beliefs?

1p1nrjf,https://i.redd.it/rggjf8k0ua2g1.jpeg,Maybe the devil will save us....,"The air in Marco’s basement apartment hung thick with the stale scent of lukewarm pizza and desperation. On his ancient, flickering TV, a sports pundit droned on about the Dallas Mavericks' recent losing streak. Luka Dončić, once the radiant star, was long gone, traded in a bewildering series of moves that left the Mavs a shadow of their former glory. Marco, a Mavs die-hard since Dirk’s rookie year, couldn't take it anymore.

He’d tried everything: lucky jerseys, elaborate pre-game rituals, even sacrificing his sleep schedule to watch every agonizing minute. Nothing worked. As the pundit declared the Mavs’ season officially ""over,"" a cold resolve settled in Marco's gut. There was only one option left.

He cleared a space on his coffee table, scattering empty chip bags. From a dusty bookshelf, he pulled out a forgotten, leather-bound book he’d bought at a weird antique fair years ago – ""Compendium of Arcane Bargains."" Following the faded, Latin instructions, he pricked his finger with a rusty paperclip. A single drop of blood welled up, shimmering crimson in the dim light. He whispered the archaic incantation.

The room didn't get dark, or cold, or smoky. Instead, the TV screen flickered violently, then settled on a new image: a sleek, impeccably dressed man with eyes that gleamed like polished obsidian sat in a plush armchair, sipping from a delicate teacup. He looked less like a demon and more like a venture capitalist who’d just closed a particularly lucrative deal.

""Marco, my dear boy,"" the man purred, his voice like expensive whiskey. ""You summoned?""

Marco gulped. ""Yeah. I… I want Luka Dončić back. On the Mavericks. Winning championships.""

The Devil (for it was he) raised a perfectly sculpted eyebrow. ""Ah, the Slovenian Sensation. A rather specific request. And what, pray tell, do you offer in return for such a… sporting miracle?""

""My soul,"" Marco blurted, perhaps a little too eagerly.

A slow, knowing smile spread across the Devil's face. ""Your soul. A classic. Predictable, yet ever so charming. But let's be pragmatic, Marco. Your soul, while a perfectly acceptable down payment, requires *delivery*. And frankly, the bureaucracy is a nightmare. Plus, I already have a few hundred thousand disgruntled sports fans' souls from similar pacts. They just clutter up the place.""

Marco's face fell. ""So… no deal?""

""Nonsense!"" the Devil chuckled. ""I am a patron of the arts, the dramatic, the *epic*. And sports, dear Marco, is theatre on the grandest stage. I like Luka. He has… *flair*. No, your soul is too pedestrian. How about this instead?""

The Devil leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. ""You, Marco, will be the Mavs' *ultimate fan*. You will attend every home game, from now until the day you die, cheering with the intensity of a thousand suns. You will wear only Luka jerseys, even to weddings and funerals. You will meticulously chart every assist, every step-back three, every glorious win. You will become a living, breathing, slightly unhinged shrine to the legend of Luka Dončić and the Dallas Mavericks.""

""And in return?"" Marco asked, intrigued despite himself.

""In return,"" the Devil said, a flash of red in his eyes, ""Luka Dončić will return to Dallas. Not just return, mind you, but sign a lifetime contract. He will lead the Mavericks to three championships in the next five years. He will become the undisputed GOAT, making Michael Jordan look like a rec-league player. The Mavs will build a statue of *him* outside the arena, and another statue… of *you*, the ultimate fan, forever cheering.""

Marco's jaw dropped. Three championships? A statue? This was better than he could have ever imagined! ""Deal!""

""Excellent!"" the Devil clapped his hands, a faint smell of sulfur briefly permeating the room. ""One minor detail: your passion must be **unwavering**. Should your faith falter, should you miss a game, or God forbid, cheer for another team, even for a moment… Luka will immediately be traded to the Knicks, never to be heard from again. And your 'ultimate fan' status will transfer to a life-size cardboard cutout of a rival team's mascot, in your place at every game, forever.""

Marco didn't hesitate. ""I accept! I'll never waver!""

""Good,"" the Devil said, his form beginning to fade. ""A pleasure doing business with you, Marco. And do try to clean up this apartment; it's quite dreadful. Toodles!""

The TV screen returned to the dumbfounded sports pundit. Marco stared, heart pounding. He suddenly felt an electric surge of energy. He looked at his cluttered room, then at his old, faded Luka jersey hanging on a chair. He had work to do. He had a destiny to fulfill.

The next day, sports channels exploded. ""LUKA DONČIĆ DEMANDS TRADE BACK TO DALLAS!"" ""MAVERICKS REACQUIRE LUKA IN SHOCKING BLOCKBUSTER!"" The city erupted in joyous chaos.

Marco, meanwhile, was already at the arena, the first in line for season tickets, wearing his cleanest Luka jersey. He had a lifetime of cheering ahead of him, a lifetime of glorious victories. He just hoped the Devil had good taste in cardboard mascots, just in case.",0,1763595723.0,Mavericks,8,0.38,False

1p1nnp9,https://i.redd.it/0mu7aeaqua2g1.jpeg,Is the Lincoln Dutch Bros planning on violating California labor laws?,"Lincoln can look forward to a new Dutch Bros opening at 273 Lincoln Blvd.

They have put out a call for people to apply, but there are two glaring issues in their advertisement.

Under Compensation, it states the following:

“Up to $18.00 per hour

Number includes an average tip of $6.00 per hour.

What we strive for:
a fun environment, great co-workers, and a chance to make a difference in your community. 

What we don't guarantee:
tip averages.”

https://careers.dutchbros.com/us/en/job/CA2313/Broista-Lincoln-CA-95648

If they can’t guarantee tips, all they are guaranteeing is $12 an hour.

Even if they could guarantee tips, gratuity is NOT applicable in minimum wage requirements.

California minimum wage is currently $16.50 an hour, set to go up to $16.90 on January 1st, 2026.

https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/minimum_wage.htm

However, any major fast-food chain in California is required to pay a minimum of $20 an hour if the franchise location meets three requirements:

• The restaurant must be a ""limited-service restaurant"" in California. A limited service restaurant is one that offers limited or no table service, where the customers order food or beverage items and pay for those items before the items are consumed.

• ﻿﻿The restaurant is part of a restaurant chain of at least 60 establishments nationwide. An establishment is a single restaurant location offering food or beverages to customers. Offsite business locations (geographically separate from a restaurant location), at which employees perform administrative, warehouse, or preparatory food production tasks, are not counted as ""establishments"" toward the 60 establishment minimum.
﻿﻿
• The restaurant is primarily engaged in selling food and beverages for immediate consumption.

https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Fast-Food-Minimum-Wage-FAQ.htm

As it stands, this location meets all three requirements:

- No table service and payment in advance.

- California hosts approximately 215 Dutch Bros locations.

- Food and drinks are designed for immediate consumption.

And this location does not appear to qualify for an exemption to the $20 an hour law.

So as their advertisement stands, not only are they intending to potentially violate California’s $16.50 minimum wage requirement for 2025, they are completely ignoring the California Fast Food Minimum Wage requirement of $20 an hour.

In the interest of giving this good company the benefit of the doubt, I want to clarify that the second glaring issue on this same advertisement on their Dutch Bros site states this location is at “95 Lincoln Blvd,” which it is not. So perhaps the person filling out this franchises particular location info has this mixed up with a “Lincoln” located in another state, which would affect the minimum wage pay scale.

Because I’m definitely a supporter of Dutch Bros, I’ll wait until these discrepancies get cleared up before casting any negative judgement their way.

Let’s hope this is simply a mix up and stay optimistic that this new local employer fully intends to pay this locations employees what they are legally entitled to earn.

Then ARC Raiders Turned Me Into the Bad Guy,"There I was, sitting at my desk, scarfing down the last few bites of my lunch with barely five minutes left before I had to clock back in. Against all reason, I decided to boot up ARC Raiders for “just one quick round”... You know how that goes.

My heart was racing; I didn’t even bother customizing my loadout, just took the free one and dove in. Low on everything. Suddenly, I spotted two guys looting right next to me. I froze-do I risk it? I have never killed anyone, everyone is just TOO KIND in this game. If I do nothing, I’m dead anyway because I didn't have any shield recharger.

Time was ticking, both in-game and in real life. With my hands literally trembling from adrenaline (and maybe too much coffee), I made my move. I caught the first guy off guard (Yeah I became a rat), shots ringing out and echoing in my headphones. Then his friend (who was probably a stranger) came barreling over, desperately trying to save him. Above the chaos, I hear over comms: “Get him! Get him!”

My palms were slick, my hands shaking as I fumbled to reload, just in time! By some miracle, I managed to take out the second guy. The silence after the firefight was deafening, broken only by the second guy’s voice: “Do what you came to do. End it.” He sounded like a 40 yo guy.

I just sat there for a second, staring at the screen. I’m 36. I play games to chill, not to crush people’s spirits. I could tell these were older, casual dudes just like me, probably sneaking in some game time during a lunch break. And there I was, their unlikely villain...

I’ve played shooters all my life, SOCOM was my addiction as a teenager, but I’ve never felt so conflicted. I didn’t ambush them from behind or do anything cheap. For the first time, I was the main character in someone else’s tragic lunchtime story.

And honestly? I felt awful. I imagined them, just wanting a peaceful run, maybe one of them saying “GG” before logging back to the grind. I ruined it because I was desperate for that last rush before returning to work.

**(TLDR at the bottom for those of you who look at this novel and want to nope out)**

Hi friends,

I (30f) have been a part of ENM in some way for about a decade on and off. My current partner (40m, Elliot) and I have been ENM for our whole relationship and we have had a steady girlfriend almost since the start, among some relationships that didn't pan out.

Elliot and I have been long distance for a lot of our relationship, but early on he introduced me to his friend (59m, Nick). Nick is one of those people that most people just seem to like and Elliot was always going on about how great Nick was before he even introduced us. Nick knows we're ENM and has met a few of our partners over the years.

Nick and I have spent a significantly large amount of time together since our introduction, we clicked *super* well immediately and it's been a pretty steadfast friendship, especially owing to the fact that our schedules line up really well so if my other friends aren't available when I am, I know he usually is and vice versa. We do pretty much everything together: outdoor activities, movies, going out for coffee/dinner, going out with a couple we are friends with, meals at each other's places, co-working. We share books, watching movies or shows the other recommends, share food and drinks.

I've almost always had a genuine crush on Nick because he's easily one of the coolest and smartest people I've ever met and I admire the life he has lead. At some point about two years ago the crush got a little crush-ier and I mentioned it to an ex-friend who - upon meeting him for the first time at an event with me - emphatically insisted that Nick and I had *a lot of* ***tension.*** I dismissed her mostly because she said a lot of really weird shit with no substance to back it up.

Cut to today, I've finally admitted to myself that I'm in love with Nick. Another friend of mine has mentioned that Nick seems to be ""throwing hints"". Both this friend and my counsellor (who specializes in poly relationships and is poly herself) have advised that I inform Elliot (who does have some idea but it hasn't been talked about directly) that I am interested in letting my feelings be known in regards to his friend, and then depending on the response either figure out how we can move forward or take a massive step back in my friendship with Nick.

But I am a coward and super scared of change - I am trying to convince myself that I'm not in control of everything and things will change eventually, either someone moving or Nick getting into a serious relationship or who knows what else. But taking the step to talk to Elliot about this is *terrifying* to me because of the possibility of change.

What would you guys do? TIA

**TL;DR:**  
I’m (30f) in a long-term ENM relationship with my partner, Elliot (40m). For years, I’ve had a close friendship—and a growing crush—with his friend Nick (59m), who I spend a lot of time with. Recently I’ve realized I’m actually in love with Nick, and friends (plus my poly-savvy counselor) think he might be hinting back. They recommend I talk to Elliot and figure out next steps, but I’m terrified of risking the dynamics of my relationship and friendship.

 CHAPTER 1 — The Rig

[11:26PM Wednesday March 23rd]

The rig was cold.

The cab, empty, stunk of old socks and cigarettes. Its smell washed over me like an exhumed casket, a sour miasma that contrasted with the otherwise neat quarters. Dried, thick syrupy coffee pooled, curving around a clean depression. Stayed put long enough for it to congeal around them.

I stood there a moment, looking into the cab the way you might look at a dead animal on the roadside. There was no labor in my breathing, no surprise in my expression, just a cold acceptance that I wasn't going to get any answers tonight. The world leaves strange things behind, and I was no detective.

I knew these roads well. The rig hadn't been here long, week at most. Still, in the dark it looked ancient, as if it had always been there, laid to rest in the gravel turnoff a few miles outside town. My headlights barely cut through the murk around it. No markings on the trailer. No running lights. No engine ticking from heat. Just a dead hulk of steel sitting in the cold quiet night.

I let my hand rest on the door frame before a slow recoil, reaching for a rag I kept over my holster on my belt, wiping away any semblance of my tampering. Then, retrieving gloves and tools from my truck, I made my way toward the back of the trailer.

I stared at the latch, bolt cutter in hand—calm, Coldy—and with a single clean squeeze, the lock snapped free. The door groaning open, dragging through the air like something wretched clearing its throat.

And then—

Silence.

So complete and absolute.

As if all at once every cricket ceased, every gust stalled. My breath hung in the whimpering beam of my headlights like a pale ghost, unmoving in the still air.

Inside revealed nothing but a deep, dark pit of blackness. I hovered there for a breath, then lifted my old flashlight and shone it into the inky interior.

The silence turned into an eerie ring, before closing the door loosely.

The night's sounds reigniting into an all too familiar symphony of crickets and distant vehicles.

""Nope"" I declared, before walking back to my truck, sliding in, and shifting into gear.

I rolled forward a few feet, hands tightening on the wheel, but something dug at the back of my mind—quiet, persistent. Not a whisper. Not a thought. Just weight.

I let the truck idle, then slowly backed it up toward the trailer again. Cut the headlights. Letting the dark swallow the cab.

And just as before, I stepped out, walked to the back, and opened the trailer door.

CHAPTER 2 — Hunger's Hand

[11:23PM Wednesday March 23rd]

Ezra woke the way he always did now

as if someone else had opened his eyes for him.

No inhale. No blink.

Just eyes open, body already angled as though halfway through standing.

The motel room was cold, but it didn't touch him. He sat in the bed a few seconds, not waking up, but waiting, listening.

He rose in a single smooth motion.

His feet hit the floor exactly the same way they always did: heel, then toe. Centered and silent.

Moving through the room like a hulking ghost, his boots found the silent places between protests. And. When the floorboards did groan, the sound came delayed—reluctant—as though the house itself was uncertain whether to give him away in fear of retaliation.

Ezra pulled the tool roll from beneath the bed and unwrapped it delicately, his hands running across the interior tenderly before sealing it and dropping it harshly on the bed.

Ezra dressed the rest of the way—shirt, jacket, jeans, gloves—each motion square, exact, inevitable.

He paused at the mirror, adjusting his hair with two careful strokes. A speck of blood decorated his collar. He tutted—soft, almost musical—and dabbed at it with his thumb the way someone might brush away lint. The stain spread slightly. He stopped. Tilted his head. Then buttoned his jacket over it and turned off the lights.

The motel room behind him looked untouched. Bed made with hospital corners. Sink dry. The shower curtain rod hung empty—

The room stunk of bleach.

He collected his tool roll from the bed, checked the parking lot through a gap in the curtains, then shut off the lights.

The door clicked shut behind him with a sound like a chamber sealing.

He stood on the concrete walkway for a moment, head turning slightly—not looking at anything visible, just... adjusting. Feeling for something in the air.

Then he walked to his sedan, slid behind the wheel, and drove toward the pull he couldn't name but had learned never to ignore.

**THE RIG**

**[7:58 AM Thursday March 24th]**

He saw the semi long before he reached it—a hulking, dark shape stranded half in the lane, half off the shoulder.

Ezra slowed the sedan, pulled onto the shoulder a hundred yards back, and killed the engine.

He sat for a moment, hands resting on the wheel, watching.

CHAPTER 3 — The Things We Don't Say

[11:00AM Wednesday March 23rd]

[Hey kid] read a text from Dorin, [Luka stopped by for a bit, couldn't get him to stay put for more than a couple minutes before he left, but he asked about you. I thought you should know.]

I slid behind the wheel, the cab still smelling faintly of sawdust and sweat. Just before dawn I'd pulled my pickup onto the Mulberry place, spending the last few hours resetting broken fence posts, tightening stray boards, and coaxing stubborn hinges back into line. My toolbox rattled in the bed: a half-worn hammer, a flattened tape measure, and a handful of nails I'd pinched off the foreman's stash.

Funny how I've come to depend on those tools as much as my radio or my piece. They're the one honest things I own. By the time I wrapped up, the sun was bleary orange over the prairie, and I could already feel the weight of the day off my shoulders.

As I eased onto the highway, my thoughts drifted somewhere else. Hands tapping rhythmically to the radio.

The station cut out halfway through a song. Static hissed, then fell to a low hiss. I let it stay off.

I locked my phone and set it face-down on the passenger seat. The cab suddenly felt warmer than it had a few minutes ago. I cracked the window for some air and drove toward the caravan.

[12:03PM] — The Caravan

The Caravan sat where it always did, half-trailer park, half-roadside inn, all held together with plywood, tarps, and stubbornness. The main building was a long two windowed high relic with faded blue siding and a porch that sagged in the middle like a tired back.

I pulled in beside Dorin's old truck. He was out front, hunched on an overturned bucket, working a rag into a now greasy ball bearing. He didn't look up right away.

""You're back early,"" he said, eyes still on the ball bearing.

""Mulberry wasn't as bad as he said."" I shut my door. ""Replaced four posts, tightened the rest. Gate's not dragging anymore.""

Dorin grunted. I took it as the usual, causal expression of recognition.

On the table beside him lay a small bundle wrapped in a shop towel. He nudged it toward me with his wrist.

""Boy dropped this off for you this morning,"" he said. ""Didn't stay long.""

I unwrapped the towel. My pistol lay there, clean and oiled, the metal catching what little light filtered through the cloud cover.

""Hmmp"" I replied.

I nodded, re-wrapping the pistol.

Dorin watched me for a moment, eyes narrowed against the light. He looked older in the daytime like this—creases deeper, hair more gray than black. Luka's face lived in his bones somewhere, but you had to squint to see it.

""You eaten?"" he asked.

""Not yet.""

""Go see Siobhan before she throws the pot out. She's got chili going.""

""Yes, sir.""

He snorted at that, half-amused, and turned his attention back to the metal in his hands.

Inside, the Caravan's main room smelled like coffee, onions, and whatever spices Siobhan insisted on using no matter the recipe. A few regulars sat scattered at tables, some nursing mugs, others half-asleep over their plates.

Siobhan caught me as soon as I stepped in.

""You look like a kicked dog,"" she said. ""Bowl?""

I didn't argue. She thrust a chipped ceramic bowl into my hands, steam curling up from thick chili. 

“Mutts like us gotta stay fed or we bite” she remarked.

I nodded, grabbed a spoon and retreated to a corner table. The first bite burned my tongue. I kept eating.

Mateo waved from the far side of the room, a dish towel slung over his shoulder. Jeremiah moved behind him, arms full of glasses, nearly dropping one before catching it against his chest.

""You owe me a hand with the windows later,"" Mateo called. ""I'm not climbing that ladder alone.""

""We'll see how the day goes,"" I said.

He rolled his eyes but didn't push it.

Anisa breezed past my table with a tray, bumping my shoulder on purpose. ""Try not to brood into the food,"" she said smiling. ""Makes it salty.""

""Pretty sure that's the best part,"" I said coily, ""Just like my momma's cooking""

By the time the bowl was half-finished, the weight in my chest had settled into something quieter. The room was warm, lit with that dingy mid-day light that made everything feel softer around the edges.

For a moment, I could almost pretend this was home.

Dorin stepped inside, letting the screen door slap shut behind him. Conversations dipped for a second, picking back up once people saw it was just him.

""Owen,"" he said.

I set the spoon down. ""Yeah?""

""Haven't heard from Harper in two days."" Dorin leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. ""He was supposed to check in yesterday. Didn't. Called this morning. No answer.""

""That old bastard’s probably still right at home watching Bonanza,"" Siobhan said from behind the counter. ""Again.""

""Maybe,"" Dorin said. He didn't sound convinced. His eyes stayed on me. ""You're heading his way later anyway.""

""Am I?"" I asked accusingly.

Dorin scowled, ""Swing by. Make sure he hasn't broken his hip or shot his own foot off.""

I took another sip of chili to buy a second. ""You want me to go now?""

""Before dark,"" Dorin said. ""He'll bitch less if he’s tired'""

Siobhan shook her head. ""If he's tired, then he's asleep, think he’ll bitch more""

Dorin ignored her.

""Take water,"" he added. ""He never remembers.""

""Alright,"" I said. ""I'll go.""

He gave one short nod and pushed back out the door, the screen clattering shut behind him.

I finished the bowl. Took my time rinsing it in the sink, listening to the small sounds of the inn—plates, murmured talk, the hum of the fridge. Normal noises.

Then I grabbed my jacket, the wrapped pistol, and a jug of water from the cooler, and headed back out.

**[10:12PM]**

Night crept in faster than I thought it would.

By the time I left the Caravan, the sky was a deep, purplish black, the last streaks of daylight wiped clean off the horizon. The air had cooled enough that my breath fogged faintly as I crossed the lot.

I checked my phone—no new messages—and tossed it onto the seat beside me. The pistol went back in its place under the dash. I started the engine and pulled out toward the county road that led to Harper's.

The highway ahead was mostly empty this time of night. My headlights cut long white paths through the dark, swallowing fence posts and road signs as they went. The radio was off. I didn't bother turning it on.

Wind nudged at the truck whenever I passed an open stretch, then died again as the land dipped. Miles slipped by without much thought.

Somewhere past mile marker 19, everything seemed to narrow. The road, the darkness, my focus. I came around a slight bend, half-drifting in my head—

—and the world snapped sharp all at once.

There was a hulking shape in my lane, too close, too sudden.

""Shit!""

I slammed the brakes. The tires screeched, gravel spitting out from under them as the truck skidded to a ugly, lurching stop less than a truck-length from the back of a semi-trailer.

Heart hammering, I sat there gripping the wheel, breath punching in and out in short bursts.

The semi sat half on the gravel shoulder, half bleeding into the right lane. No hazards. No running lights. Just a dark, silent wall of steel.

""Who the hell parks like that…"" I muttered, more to ground myself than anything.

I killed the engine and stepped out.

**[10:25PM] — The Rig**

I walked around the front, my boots crunching on gravel and stray bits of road salt. The air was colder here, somehow. Thinner.

""Hello?"" I called. ""You alright in there?""

No answer.

I climbed up and leaned, looking for any sign of movement, hand on my holster.

Whoever drove this hadn't taken anything important with them. They just… left. But that imprint left a heavy weight in my stomach.

I climbed down, jaw tight, and walked along the side of the trailer.

The back doors were shut. A thick padlock held them together.

I stared at it, feeling that tug-of-war start in my chest—mind saying walk away, before just muttering, ""yeah that's about right"" with heavy sarcasm.

I went back to my truck, grabbed the bolt cutters from the bed, and returned to the doors. The lock resisted, then gave with a heavy, unceremonious snap.

The broken lock fell into the gravel with a flat clack that sounded too loud.

I slipped the latch, braced one foot on the bumper, and pulled the door open just enough to have a waft of horrid stench full my nostrils.

Turning on my flashlight I reluctantly shone it inside. The beam catching on an arm first—pale skin against the dark, wrist cuffed to a square suitcase. The rest of the body lurked beyond the reach of the angle, swallowed in shadow.

Every muscle in me went tight.

I jerked the door shut.

""Nope,"" I said aloud, voice rough.

I stood there, breathing too fast, the cold air burning my throat. The driver's arm—what little I'd seen of it—and that suitcase burned with morbid curiosity.

Everything told me to leave, to get in my truck and drive as far away as I could from this place, this state.

And I almost drove away before, making one last attempt to appease my curiosity.

Inside, the trailer smelled metallic and sweet in the worst way. My boots stuck slightly to the floor in spots. I kept the flashlight beam tight, pointed down, then slowly raised it.

The driver had been thrown onto his back, or dragged, or both. It was hard to tell. His chest was… wrong. Torn open in jagged, overlapping gouges that didn't look like anything with teeth or tools I recognized. Flesh peeled back, ribs exposed, angles all off, like someone had tried to open him and then lost interest halfway through.

The left wrist was still cuffed to the suitcase. Up close, I could see where the metal had bitten into his skin, purple and torn.

My throat clenched. I swallowed hard, tasting the coppery air and my own rising bile.

""Jesus,"" I whispered.

I focused on the suitcase. Clean. No blood on it. No dents. No scratches. A perfect rectangle in the middle of a crime scene.

Whoever did this hadn't touched it.

I crouched beside the driver, careful not to look directly at his face. The handcuff chain was thick, and wet.

I ran my fingers over the mechanism.

For a long moment, I did nothing. Just listened to the hollow sound of my own breathing inside the metal box of the trailer, the faint buzz of distant highway, the thump of my heartbeat in my ears.

Then I stood up too fast. The world tilted. I stumbled toward the doors, climbed down, and barely made it to the gravel before I bent over and threw up.

Everything came up at once—chili, coffee, whatever was left.

I spat, wiped my mouth with the back of my hand, and stood there hunched, hands on my knees, breath rasping in and out like I'd run a mile.

""Okay,"" I said to no one. ""Okay.""

The trailer loomed behind me, door yawning open like a mouth.

I could leave. Call it in anonymous and keep driving. Pretend I'd never stopped.

Instead, I forced myself back up the ramp.

The second time inside was worse. I knew what was waiting for me now. I kept my eyes away from the shredded mess of his chest and his face and focused instead on his pockets.

""Sorry,"" I muttered under my breath, as if he were still alive.

I looked around him. Nothing. Checked his pants. In the back pocket I found a phone, slick and cold under my fingers. I pulled it out, the screen black.

Pressing it on, the screen came to life.

A photo, which I assumed was of the driver and a woman, greeted me with chimes as missed calls and messages. Locked behind a password I cared not to explore.

My stomach turned as a morbid solution to my predicament rose.

Grabbing his left hand—the one not mangled beyond use—and pressed his thumb against the screen.

Like a grave robber, I was in.

Only moments before opening the caller did the gravity of my future actions set in.

I hit 911 before I could talk myself out of it.

""911, what's your emergency?"" a woman's voice asked, calm, practiced.

My mouth opened. Nothing came out. My gaze slid back to the driver's chest, the torn fabric, the way his jaw hung wrong.

""Hello? Emergency services, what's your location?""

I swallowed, but the words would not come.

Lingering for what felt impossibly long—

I hung up.

The silence that followed was louder than her voice had been.

They'd have the location now. That should have been enough.

My eyes went back to the suitcase.

Dusty. Untampered . Handcuffed to a bloated wrist.

I stared at it until my vision blurred.

Grabbing the bolt cutters I attempted to pry the cuffs from the suitcase, but the cutters blade dented and beveled with each squeeze.

My desire quickly dehydrating with each failed cut, but my curiosity remained.

Before I knew what I was doing, I grabbed the driver's arm with both hands. The skin was cold and giving. I gritted my teeth, braced my feet against his ribcage and face, and twisted.

There was a wet crunch as the bones in his wrist gave. I didn't let myself stop. I forced the hand around, getting the angle I needed, each pull revealing more and more of the sinewy muscle of the hand, until finally the hand degloved and so went what was left in my stomach.

I laid there on my back, I swallowed hard, the acidic bile dripping down my lips.

Again the gravity of my actions like snow on an aluminum shed, I crumbled.

Eventually I backed out of the trailer slowly, one step at a time, the case bumping against my knee.

Outside, the air felt sharper, like I'd just surfaced from underwater. Crickets had started up again somewhere down the ditch. A car passed in the far distance, headlights just a faint flicker over the rise.

I shut the trailer door gently, as if atoning for waking up a beast in its slumber, but I was no saint, and my reward offered me no solace.

The broken lock lay in the gravel at my feet.

I left it there.

The suitcase handle dug into my palm as I walked back to my truck. Hiding the suitcase beneath the scraps of wood in my truck bed.

I didn't look back a the rig.

Not once.

[11:48PM Wednesday March 23rd]
I wasn't far from Harpers Ranch, in fact the rig was only a short detour from where I should've been heading all along. A handful of miles off the main highway, lined with fence posts and empty prairie.

The way the night had been going left me with an empty dread, however the reasons for my visit to the old ranch were already less than cheerful.
Whatever was left in the trailer could stay in the dark a while longer. Could be buried forever as far as I was concerned.

I thought about the bloody gloves that laid upon my lap.

Quickly opening my window and tossing them out. A slight shudder rose from me, but I kept the icy cold air on my face until I couldn't stand it any longer. Like a cold shower after a bad dream.
I had other business tonight.

My truck's headlights carved two bright lines down the lane to Harper Farm, finally coming to rest before the longhorn-adorned gate. Killing the engine, I swung the door open, the cold air tasting of frost and damp earth. Darkness pressed in: beyond the halo of my headlights, the yard dissolved into heavy blackness as I stepped back onto the cold ground, jug in hand.

I clicked on my flashlight, its beam trembled then steadied to a pale cone. Gravel crunching underfoot as I make my way toward the farmhouse. The only sound was the low moan of wind through broken fence boards and a distant owl's two-note call. Every step loosened something in me as the house came into view - familiar, quiet.

""Already sleeping, Harper?"" I muttered with the slightest smirk as I scanned the porch. A lone red bulb blinked above the door, and through one tattered curtain on the left, a warm glow pulsed.
I paused at the first wooden rail, where a strip of red stained cloth fluttered in the breeze.

Then just as quickly as it appeared, all that easy familiarity soured. My steps grew heavy, dragged down by an intensity of dread as I made my way to the main gate. Its hinges hadn't been oiled in years; each squeal squeaked like pigs to slaughter.

I winced despite myself, swallowing hard, fingers tightening around the flashlight until they ached.

For a moment I just stood there, listening.

Halfway down the drive, as if on queue, a sudden woosh snapped my attention to the pasture: a great shape shot up from the grass. I dropped the jug, hand now hovering above luka’s pistol. My beam caught a flash of hoof and hide before a tattered red flag, snagged on the broken gate, clattered in the wind. The gate swung open, groaning on its rusted axle, as though inviting me in.

Heart thudding, I swallowed and stepped into the field. Each beam of light revealed scarlet-stained grass, the earth beaten down by trampling. Before me, the fence lay in splinters, and beyond it, three cattle lay crumpled on the ground. I can't say it didn't rattle me. I don't know if it was the sight or the stench that hit me first: ragged wounds tearing their flesh, ribs jutting like broken stakes, tufts of hide caught on the bent rails.

I crouched and traced a fingertip along a deep, uneven boot print in the churned mud. My stomach tightened. Snagged on a barb was a scrap of leather embroidered with a golden Celtic knot. I slipped it into my pocket and stood, the ranch's silent horror pressing in.

I wrapped my jacket tighter around me, the cold seeping into my bones. My jaw clenched—not just at the cattle strewn in the field, but at the thought of Harper, alone in that house. What bad luck brought this on him, on me?

Each step toward Harper's door felt heavier, driven by the intense desire to find him and bolt.
The porch creaked under my boots as I pushed inside. The living room was a chaos of splintered wood and scattered books—paperbacks fanned across the rug like fallen soldiers. A battered TV flickered a black-and-white western: gunshots and shouted one-liners drifting through the gloom. One bare bulb overhead flickered in uneven bursts—thunk… pause… thunk…—like a stuttering breath.

I froze as I let the door behind me close, its hinges wailing just before it slammed, echoing harshly throughout the empty room. There was no solace in the silence that followed, no relief in the un-answered call. Then as if beckoning me further into the house I saw the door leading to Harper's bedroom, its white glossy visage burning in between each dark gasp of the living room lights flickering.

A thick, foul stench—like rot and sweat and something fouler—drifted from deeper in the house towards Harper's bedroom. My hand hovered at my holster as I moved through the wreckage, drifting and weaving through splintered tables and broken chairs.

From somewhere beyond came the rasp of a mechanical whir—an old fan struggling against dust. Ahead, the hallway led to the bedroom. Each step echoed. I heard a soft, scratching sound like claws on plaster—a wet, uneven scraping that made my hair stand on end.

I made my way over, silent but for the soft whir of the distant fan. My heart drummed in my ears, each thump louder than the last. I stopped. Nothing moved. The only sound was the faint creak of the floorboards under my boots—and the distant click of that fan slowing, then speeding up again.

I raised my hand to the doorknob and for a moment time froze.

The floor beneath me bowed, along came deep agonizing creaks. Reaching the bedroom door I then braced myself, as the door flung open. I was met with a terrified bull charging, horns lowered, hooves smashing into my ribs. The impact knocked the wind out of me; I crashed to the floor, coughing and sputtering as the beast thundered past. Shards of glass and splinters flew as it burst through the living window, its hooves shredding the green carpet.

I lay gasping, chest burning, until the ringing in my ears faded. Pushing myself up, the world spinning,I limped towards the now mangled doorframe.

Pale TV light filtered through the shattered window frame, illuminating the horror: crimson spattered across walls and floor, a brutal canvas only intensified by the horrid stench that crawled up my nostrils.

Before I could linger, a low mechanical whir grabbed my attention toward the bathroom. Each step felt heavier than the last. I pushed the half opened door open on one struggling hinge and found Old Man Harper slumped against the sink in the bathroom, blood matted in his hair and clothes. His breathing was ragged, but the moment our eyes met, relief flickered in his gaze.
""Oh, it's just you,"" he rasped, voice rough with pain and sarcasm. ""Never thought I'd look forward to seeing you, boy.""

I knelt beside him, sliding an arm under his shoulders. A wretched belch rose out of his gullet, as I began to prop him up.

""Hold on, Harper. I've got you."" I winced as all the smells attacked my senses.

Supporting him through the wreckage, I half-carried him out to the porch. Easing him into the passenger seat of my truck, and draping a blanket around his shoulders as he muttered to himself, eyes locked on the ruined house.
I leaned on the driver's door frame.

""What happened, Harper?"" I asked, voice low.

He met my gaze, confusion and exhaustion in his eyes. He opened his mouth, then shook his head—an unspoken, I don't know.

I climbed in, started the engine, and eased onto the road. In the rearview, the farmhouse receded into silhouette.

""I'm taking you back to The Caravan,"" I said quietly. ""Siobhan's chili'll fix you right—but we're gonna talk about this, you hear?""

Harper gave a faint nod. The winding highway stretched before us, empty as a promise.
Just another day clocking in, I thought, though today had shattered me, chewed me up and spit me out.

[12:31 AM Thursday March 24th]

Harper sagged against the passenger door like the truck was the only thing keeping him upright. I kept one hand on the wheel, the other braced loosely at ten o'clock, thumb digging into the worn groove in the plastic.

The heater wheezed somewhere between warm and useless. Every bump in the road pulled a low sound out of Harper's throat—half groan, half something else I didn't want to name.
The bandage I'd wrapped around his head was already seeping through. Dark stain spreading under the dome light.

""You still with me?"" I asked.

He blinked slow, eyes tracking the windshield like he was trying to see past the glass into something beyond.

""Don't have much choice, do I,"" he rasped. Then softer, barely audible, ""Just drive, boy.""

The road back to town was a straight black ribbon, the kind that usually let my mind wander. Tonight it felt like walking a tightrope with too much weight on either side.

I reached into my pocket. The leather scrap was still there—the one I'd found snagged on Harper's fence wire. I pulled it out and turned it over between my fingers. The embroidery caught the dashboard light. Golden thread woven into a Celtic knot, intricate and deliberate. Someone had cared about this. Spent time on it.

My thumb found the edge and traced it, over and over. The repetition helped. Gave me something to focus on that wasn't the bull's head on Harper's bed or the way the house had looked gutted and wrong.

Harper's breathing hitched beside me. I checked him again without turning my head. His eyes were half-closed, hand pressed against the bandage.
""You're gonna be fine,"" I said, not sure if I believed it.

""Been not fine for a long time,"" he muttered. ""This is just... new flavor of it.""

We didn't talk after that.

The highway hummed under the tires. Once, a set of distant headlights crested a hill ahead and washed over us, bright and blinding for a moment. Harper flinched hard enough to smudge blood down the side window with his shoulder.

I wanted to say something. Wanted to ask him what he remembered, what he'd seen before the bull came through. But his eyes had that faraway look people get when they're only half-present, and I didn't want to pull him back into it.
My thumb kept moving over the scrap. The leather was soft, worn smooth in places. Old. Well-loved, maybe.

I thought about the fence where I'd found it. The way it had been snagged on the barbed wire, fluttering in the wind like a small flag. The bulls trampling everything around it. The blood in the grass.

Someone had been there.

Someone who left this behind.

Harper mumbled something under his breath. I glanced over.

""What?""

""Windows,"" he said, voice thick. ""Didn't lock the windows.""

""It's alright, Harper. We'll get you sorted.""

He didn't seem to hear me. His head lolled against the seat, eyes slipping closed again.
I turned my attention back to the road. The Caravan's neon sign bled into view over the next rise, warm yellow light cutting through the dark. Almost there.

I slipped the leather scrap back into my pocket and tightened my grip on the wheel.
Harper's breathing evened out. Not asleep—just somewhere else.

By the time I pulled into the gravel lot and killed the engine, my hands ached from holding the wheel too tight.

""Alright, old man,"" I said quietly. ""Show's over. Let's get you inside.""

He didn't answer, but when I opened his door and hooked an arm under his, he pushed his feet down and helped a little.

That was something.

CHAPTER 4 — Bring Me Your Weak

[~5:00 AM Thursday March 24th]

Stepping out, the morning air was sharp and clean. His boots touched the gravel, crunching beneath with ever step.

As he approached, circling the rig in a wide arc like a vulture, his eyes cataloged everything. Tire marks in the dirt, the angle of the cab, the way the trailer sagged slightly to one side.

Running his thumb through a thin film of dust on the side mirrors, Ezra just stood there before moving on. Rubbing the dust between his fingers as he made his way to the driver side door.

Pausing once more.

He hovered a long time over the handle, before pulling it open.

Air leaking out. Stagnant.

Stepping up onto the runner he leaned in.
Diesel. Ash. The sour-sweet residue of cheap cologne mixing with days-old body odor. And underneath it all—something else. Like a new born in a delivery room, the trace was subtle but present.

The seat was empty.

Marked with a dark ring of dried liquid—coffee, thick as syrup, gone black with age—had crusted like a timestamp.

The vinyl beneath had compressed so deeply it looked melted. Warped.

Ezra's fingers traced the air above the stain, not touching. Reading the shape, emotionless.
They'd sat here. Unmoving. While the coffee went from hot to cold to solid. While the sun rose and set. Rose again.

He climbed down.

Closed the door softly.

Following a half-circle around the trailer, he crouched beside a glint of metal.

A padlock lay in the dirt. Severed clean through the shackle. The metal edges were still bright where the cutters had bitten—no rust, no oxidation. He pinched it between gloved fingers and lifted it close to his face.

Recent. Hours, not days.

The break was crude. Forced. Whoever cut this had been in a hurry.

He set the lock down precisely where he'd found it and stood.

The trailer doors hung slightly ajar. He stepped closer, studying the gap between them. Dust had been smeared away in an arc where someone's hand had pulled. Fingerprints, maybe, beneath the grime.

He placed his palm flat against the left door. Then the right. Feeling the difference in temperature, the texture where skin oils had disrupted years of accumulated dirt.
Someone had stood here. Hesitated. Then opened it anyway.

His face remained blank—neither curious nor indifferent. Just attentive.

He pulled the door wider.

The smell came out in a wave.

Copper. Decay. The thick, sweet rot of meat left in summer heat. And something sharper underneath—the chemical tang of viscera exposed to air, organs beginning their collapse.

Ezra's head tilted slightly. His nostrils pulled in the scent, categorizing it.

Three days old. Maybe four.

He stepped inside without hesitation, boots finding purchase on the trailer floor.

The body lay in the center.

Chest opened wide, ripped upward at uneven angles. Blood dried in branching lines. One leg tucked wrong beneath the pelvis. The other thrown outward like something had jerked it until the joint failed.

Ezra crouched, hands on his knees, spine straight as a rod.

The left wrist drew his attention.

He took what remained of the hand gently and lifted. The skin had been peeled away completely, exposing raw muscle and bone beneath. The flesh ended in a ragged ring around the forearm where someone had twisted and pulled until the skin separated.

The handcuff was gone. Taken with whatever had been attached to it.

Ezra studied the exposed radius and ulna. The way the dermis had torn from the underlying structure. Circumferential avulsion. Clean separation at the wrist joint, ragged tearing further up.

He looked at the floor near the body. Boot prints in the dried blood. Two distinct impressions—one pressed into the corpse's ribcage, another across the jaw and cheekbone.

Someone had braced their feet. Used the body as leverage. Pulled until the tissue gave way rather than cut the metal.

The cuff had been too strong. The hand weaker.
Desperate. Determined.

He lowered the ruined wrist and looked at the floor.

A rectangle of clean metal and dust disturbance told him something had rested here. Heavy. Square. Handcuffed to the driver's wrist until someone forced it free.

Dragged slightly. Lifted by someone shorter than the driver. Someone strong enough to handle the weight but not skilled enough—or too panicked—to avoid leaving this much evidence.

Ezra stood.

He clicked off his flashlight.

Closed the door.

The cold air outside felt clean on his face.
Walking to the side of the cab, he unscrewed the fuel cap, and took out the short length of rubber tubing from his coat.

He siphoned diesel into an empty jug.
The taste of diesel touched his tongue, metallic and chemical, but he didn't spit. Didn't wince. Just wiped his lips with the back of his glove.

He tore strips from a shredded tarp stuck under the trailer chassis. Soaked them. Laid the rag line.
He knelt as he set the fire, steady and patient, head bowed slightly like he was working at an altar.

The flame took slowly.

Diesel always made you earn it.

Then it caught.

He watched the fire blossom beneath the trailer until the heat washed against his legs. Only then did he turn his back and walk toward the truck.

No hurry.

No second glance.

HARPER'S LAND
[8:52 AM]

Ezra parked far from the driveway, letting the ditch grass swallow his tires.

He preferred approaching on foot.

From his pocket, he pulled a cherry lollipop—bright red, cellophane crinkling—and unwrapped it with the same methodical care he'd used on his tools. He placed it in his mouth. Began to suck on it.

His boots whispered through the grass, gait silent, shoulders still. He moved with a kind of structured looseness—like a puppet whose strings were pulled by a very patient hand.

The open gate was the first deviation.
Not broken. Not forced. Just... open, with the chain hanging limp and the hook bent back.
He touched the metal. Still cold from the morning. Too clean a bend. Something large and careless.

Past the fence, hoof churns tore up soil, lines of panic etched in mud.

Ezra followed them, lollipop clicking against his teeth.

The farmhouse yard was a quiet grave of trampled grass and old wood. He walked past the front door, past the shattered living room window, and moved around to the back of the house.

The bedroom window gaped open—frame torn out, glass scattered on the ground outside.
Ezra stepped through.

His boots crunched on glass inside. He didn't look down. Just moved forward, lollipop stick shifting from one side of his mouth to the other.
The bedroom was a wreck. Blood on the walls. Shredded bedding. And on the bed itself—

A bull's head.

Ezra stopped. Tilted his head slightly, studying it.
Flies crawled across the exposed flesh. The jaw hung open. The eyes were gone.

He reached down, grabbed the head by the horn—his grip casual, effortless—and lifted.

Heavy. Maybe forty pounds. He held it at his side like a bag of groceries.

Turned. Walked back through the bedroom, through the hallway, his boots leaving faint prints in the blood and dirt.

He began to whistle. Low. Tuneless. Just air passing through his lips in a rhythm only he understood.

Out through the front door, and onto the porch.
He stopped at the steps.

His tune trailing and then silence.

Like a child bored with its toy he dropped the head by his feet.

His eyes fixated on something in the distance.
Then he straightened, lollipop clicking again as he rolled it across his teeth before making his way to the barn.

THE BARN
 [9:14 AM]

The barn doors hung crooked. One side dragged in the dirt when Ezra pushed it open.
Inside, the smell hit first—hay, manure, old wood, animal fear.

The animals smelled him before they saw him.
A horse in the back stall began to whine, high and panicked. Its hooves slammed against the wooden boards. Again. Again.

Chickens in a pen near the door erupted into frantic squawking, wings beating against wire.
A goat bleated—sharp, desperate—and tried to climb the wall of its pen.

Ezra walked through the barn slowly, lollipop stick jutting from his lips. He didn't look at the animals. Didn't acknowledge their terror.

Just walked. Boots soft on the dirt floor.

He reached the back of the barn, where old tools hung on the wall. A workbench covered in rust and dust. A tarp draped over something large.
He stopped there. Stood in the dim light filtering through gaps in the wood.

Listened.

The animals screamed.

He didn't move.

Back then, I was dating someone else, and I had to choose between staying with my girlfriend at the time or pursuing something with Miel. I cut ties with Miel purely out of loyalty, not because of my feelings or logic. Even then, I knew it was more likely that something real and long-term could’ve worked with Miel than with the girl who ended up leaving me a year later.

I never went back to Miel afterwards, even though it wasn’t because I didn’t care, it was because I respected her and her choices. The only time we spoke again was maybe 7 years ago. I suggested grabbing a coffee. She asked for time to think, and eventually said no. She told me she didn’t want to suffer again, that she had suffered a lot (as if I hadn’t). I didn’t insist, because I wanted to respect her, but today I realize maybe I should have.

When we cut ties 12 years ago, I was coming from a less privileged academic path than hers, and I started feeling this deep disgust toward myself, like I wasn’t “enough” for her. And so I threw myself into this mission of climbing the social and academic ladder, of becoming someone “worthy.” I ended up fighting my way to a STEM degree in a top school in my country.

And with full honesty (and shame), I have to admit that for the last 9 years, she has been like a ghost behind me, always there in the back of my mind. She became a kind of engine pushing me forward. Because of that, I achieved things academically that I still find unbelievable given where I started. I’m about to finish my studies at MIT, which I’m extremely proud of… and yet, seeing her get married recently, seeing her Instagram stories, hit me like a truck. It made me realize how deeply the love I had for her shaped everything up to today.

To make it worse, she married someone from the same cultural background as mine. She lived the life I dreamed of sharing with her, just with someone else. And yes, I’ll spare you details like the fact that for nearly 10 years, every Saturday I would go to a shopping center near her place because it reminded me of her.

I’ve become aware that I think about her the most when I’m at my worst, like a door back to the last period of my life where I remember truly feeling happy. I know my brain is tricking me because she’s the only form of sincere love I’ve ever known. Besides her, I genuinely feel like nothing and no one has ever loved me (which is I think the main reason of all my drama and could be the subject of another post). I know I idealize her, but I also feel this deep injustice because no one ever saw or believed my sincerity. I was painted as the “asshole” in her eyes while I’ve lived the rest of my life in a kind of mourning.

I always wished her well. I always respected her. And I wish so badly that I could express everything to her once, that she could see for just a moment how much I loved her and what i have done while thinking about her. I want her out of my head, but I feel like if I don’t tell her, it’s going to be impossible. But she’s married now, and there is no way I would ever want to affect her marriage or her happiness. Her happiness is what I always wanted for her. And I know that maybe if I become happy someday, maybe I’ll finally be able to let go. But I don’t know how to be happy, that could be another post too.

Right now, I don’t know what to do. One of her posts showed up on my feed this morning and it ruined my whole day. And I hate this feeling, but a part of me still believes there’s this infinitely small probability that our paths could meet again. I cling to that thought way too much, and it’s clearly not helping me.

I wanted to write more, but honestly I don’t have the strength right now.

If you have advice or suggestions, please share them because I’m falling apart.",1,1763594464.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False
1p1n9ls,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p1n9ls,Philips 3200 brew group not locking into place,"I’m hoping someone can help me. I picked up this used like a new unit from Amazon at a pretty good price, less than $200. As far as I can see everything seems to be working OK however the brew group does not lock into place like it is supposed to. It just slides in and out even if I pop up the little yellow clip up, it just pops down as soon as I push the brew group in. It simply slides in right up to the wall then the little plastic thing disengages from the spring but does not lock into place. I’ve tried everything, making sure it’s in the neutral position etc etc but it will not lock. Not sure if it’s the brew group or the machine or if it was caused by someone yanking it out, but it doesn’t lock. It seems to make coffee OK and looking from the top hopper with the flashlight. It’s appears to line up correctly I think, but I noticed today after using my own grounded beans for a few coffees that there seems to be a little water and grounds spillage underneath the side maintenance door, is this normal with ground coffee?. It is returnable up until the end of January. Any advice from the pictures if anything seems off or points to why it won’t lock into place? ",1,1763594460.0,superautomatic,4,1.0,False

Got plenty of hobbies like games, films, anime, but from something interesting I've got a greenhouse inside my dorm room, just bought Arduino to build another one for moss✨

Also a big lover of fermentation. Any kind. Alcohol, milk products, coffee (hate the stuff, but the deepness of taste is amazing), wanna try making a beer one day, when I get some space.

As I am overwhelmed by the ideas sometimes, it does not matter, because changes come next in most of the time, so I'm opened to hear your craziest thoughts on any kind of stuff, even if you figured out, how to mine a Moon without anyone noticing and make billions.

Anyway, I'm glad that you read it till that point, if so - feel free to DM, just don't say ""Hi"", say something fun about yourself - your favorite manga, what pizza do you hate the most, do you love spiders or no - just something, otherwise it is easy to see you as a bot.

Help me list them all! 🍿,"I'm trying to make a big list of all of the cinemas (and really, anywhere that plays films) in London. So far, I've got the list below (~~148~~ 152, some big venues and some small) -- but I'd love recommendations for more places.

There's some pubs (e.g. Beer Merchants Tap hosts a cult film night), museums (e.g. The Freud Museum screens Freud related films), hotels (as it turns out, a bunch of them have cinema rooms or rooftop screenings), and music venues (e.g. Royal Albert Hall has screening with a live orchestra), etc. -- all of these are good too! Anywhere were they're showing a film 📽️

So, what's your local cinema? Or your favourite? Or that one your friend told you about but you haven't had a chance to go yet? If it's not on list below, please let me know! 🙇

Since I met her, she was a woman who enjoyed good clothes, good food, fancy places and a good and expensive lifestyle in an alternative way, she’s very gothic.

At first, she was really nice and I got along really well with her. 
But, since last year, she has become increasingly more and more kinda exhausting to me.

She’s always talking diets even when I told her I don’t like to talk about weight or dieting, because I had struggles with weight and eating, she always talks cosmetic surgery, even if I told her I’m not really the friend to talk about that because I simply don’t like it and don’t care about it.

She was always telling me every time she bought a new pair of shoes, new clothes or fancy makeup but in a braggy way. Everyday. 
She doesn’t called or texted to chat or talk nicely like friends, every time I texted to talk about things that happened or people that we know, she ignores me for days and the next time she replies is showing off the things she got done or bought. 

I never tell anyone what I bought or not, that’s just something that I don’t care to share because honestly I don’t know if anyone cares or I don’t know, I just don’t like it. 

She tells me how many grams she lost weekly and tells me if I already started dieting like I said I would. 

She made everything about money, trips she was going to book, Botox, fillers, diets, fancy coffees and stuff and I really really got tired.

At first I was okay with that, but over time, it was exhausting, and she making passive aggressive and braggy comments trying to make me feel insecure or uncomfortable or inferior for not having all those things really bothered me. 
Even when other girls of our class talked about that, she completely shifted from being in a normal conversation and laughing with me to being obsessed with impressing them telling them how she had the same lifestyle and criticizing me in front of them for not having it too or don’t wanting diets or aesthetic procedures. 

Even at my birthday, i organized a small gathering and I had to cancelled it because I felt really bad because two days before, she texted me telling me how this party of mine was the perfect opportunity for everyone who got invited to see how much she lost weight and how she dyed her hair and got a lip filler, she said she was excited, not to celebrate my birthday but to show how good she looked. 

Am I being weird or am I just being extremely picky or something? 
I sometimes think this is how girl friends work but I don’t know, I just don’t wanna talk about those things in the first place. 
Everything was fine and we were good friends who talked about interest and jokes, but everything changed.

1p1n7l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeMoCollege/comments/1p1n7l1/got_early_assurance_heres_what_you_need_to_know/,Got early assurance? Here’s what you need to know,"I was sitting in my organic chemistry lecture, half-listening to the professor drone on about resonance structures, when my friend IMed me on WhatsApp. As I stealthily clicked on the message notification, I quickly glanced over her message, “Heyy! Have you decided on whether you’re going to do [early assurance programs](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/definitive-guide-to-early-assurance-programs-for-medical-school?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=reddit_articles&sl=reddit_early_assurance_programs_for_medical_school) for medical school yet?” Before I started my second year of undergrad, I barely knew that early assurance programs existed until my friend brought them up during one of our cram sessions a couple of weeks ago. Despite the occasional lull in attention during lectures, I would still classify myself and my friend as high-achieving as, I mean, we were just planning for an important decision at the end of our sophomore year. Pretending to jot notes down, I responded in our chat, “Hii! I believe so! But let's compare notes on what we found after class!” In the blink of an eye, a tiny heart appeared under my message, followed by “Sounds good to me! Can’t wait!”

Several coffee chats (and a month or so) later, it dawned on me that I wanted to open the discourse surrounding what early assurance programs entail for medical school. A common thread in our chats was that there is surprisingly little information (our opinions, btw) regarding this decision and process. What I am trying to say is, if you’re contemplating applying or are just curious about what they entail, I hope what I have to say helps.

Want us to help you get accepted? >> Schedule a [free initial consultation](https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/schedule-free-initial-consultation-calendar-multistep?sl=reddit) <<

Well, an early assurance program, or EAP, allows high-achieving undergrad students, such as you and me, to secure conditional acceptance to medical school well before we graduate. Instead of applying during your junior or senior year, you can apply at the end of your sophomore year. If accepted, a bonus is that you might be able to bypass some requirements, such as applying and interviewing at multiple schools! You will also have more free time to focus on coursework and personal or professional development.

Yet, EAPs are highly competitive, and they have certain requirements that need to be fulfilled, which can vary from program to program. Most EAPs generally require that you have completed at least 5 pre-med courses by the end of your sophomore year, while some require that you be selected by your pre-health advisor. Of course, a high overall and science GPA is a given as it is seen as an earlier indicator of your commitment to a life as a medical practitioner. In terms of applications, some EAPs accept applications through AMCAS while others require direct applications through the institution. You will, however, be expected to submit essays (Personal statement and supplemental) and an activities list. That's why I recommend that you consider gaining experience during your freshman and sophomore years to help give you something to write for these documents. And, yes, you’ve heard right that many EAPs allow you to bypass the MCAT. But expect to spend the time that you would have prepared for the MCAT instead towards honing your intellectual inquiry skills. Also, you will still have to submit your transcripts and SAT or ACT scores; you can’t bypass these requirements in the slightest.

When it comes to their policies, some EAPs are only open to students from their own school or from programs linked to their school. Others, however, will accept students from any university. As far as agreements, schools will vary on whether your acceptance into their EAP is binding (meaning you have to attend). Most won’t require this but always check the policies of the school and program you’re applying to. Either way, you will have until the beginning of your senior year. As a word of caution, if you decide to go elsewhere, you will have to start from scratch, going through the standard application process. The bright side is that your acceptance into an EAP won’t impact your application to our schools, which is also true if you don’t get accepted into EAP as well.

If you’re undeterred by its requirements, policies, and agreements, and are thinking that EAP sounds pretty awesome, then I will kindly ask you to hold your horses. Again, like any program or decision, there are pros and cons to applying. Here are the ones that my friend and I have identified during our deep dive chats.

**Expect to say hello to the following:**

· *A secured seat*. Accepted applicants don’t have to stress and concerns over applications, interviews, or admissions during their senior year.

· *A huge savings in money and time.* Accepted applicants don’t have to waste time and money on applying to or interviewing at multiple schools or taking the MCAT in many cases.

· *A chance to bypass the MCAT.* Accepted applicants don’t have to prepare and write the MCAT for some EAPs. Be sure to triple-check their policies.

· *A bit of a breather from maintaining a near-perfect GPA.* Accepted applicants should still aim to maintain excellent grades, but the pressure is off as they have passed the most critical period, the time of applying to EAP. Again, be sure to check their policies as acceptance can be conditional on continued academic excellence throughout undergrad.

· *An ability to explore more non-req courses or extracurriculars.* Accepted applicants have more flexibility in taking classes or activities that genuinely interest them without the pressure of performance.

**Expect to say goodbye to the following:**

·  *A graceful transition.* Accepted applicants don’t have the space to struggle with balancing the shifting demands that occur between high school and undergrad as your first-and second-year marks need to be stellar and paired with strong extracurriculars.

·  *A time of self-discovery.* Accepted applicants don’t have the flexibility to fully explore this stage of life as they need to focus on committing early on to becoming a medical practitioner.

·  *An advantage of taking the MCAT.* Accepted applicants don’t have to take the MCAT in many cases, but this could be a misstep if you decide to apply to other med schools.

·   *A lack of accountability for GPA maintenance.* Accepted applicants don’t have to stress as much to maintain their GPA in the later years of their undergrad, which could lead to grades slipping. Again, this can be a misstep if you decide to apply to other med schools.

As you mull over what you will be saying hello to vs. saying goodbye to if you decide to aim for an early assurance programs, or EAPs, for medical school, one poignant thought my friend and I shared was that FOMO is going to be real whatever path we decide to choose towards medical school. Our chats made me realize that it’s okay, and it doesn’t mean that EAP is the wrong path for me, nor should it be for you. Personally, the reduced stress and academic freedom are real and worth pushing through the occasional “what ifs” spiral at 2 AM. Either way, do your research and self-reflect, and take deep breaths if you don’t get into an EAP. Now, let's start that discourse I mentioned earlier by dropping your questions in the comments, and navigate this path toward medicine together!

1p1n6qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1p1n6qc/ability_to_pivot_in_business_school_is_vastly/,Ability to pivot in business school is vastly overstated,"I have an extremely finance heavy background, and though I did well, got promoted, etc, I never enjoyed the work. My main goal going to business school was to pivot functions. In particular, I want to be out of doing financial modeling and in the weeds financially with a larger focus on strategy. I am basically industry agnostic and have been applying broadly.

Here is what has happened so far in recruitment:

* Have been completely shut down by every strategy role because they all want previous strategy/consulting experience. 
* Had general management LDPs question why I wanted to work there, ask where my operational experience was,  and suggested that I'd be better suited for finance roles.
* CPG roles (which, to be fair, I haven't really progressed beyond the coffee chat stage) question how my resume shows interest in brand management. Most of the people I know leaning into CPG recruitment are coming from a different CPG company or were otherwise in marketing/retail.
* Have not even considered trying for tech because I've had multiple people tell me that trying to come in without a technical background is a waste 

What have I been getting traction on? Finance heavy roles, particularly in the industry I previously worked in. It seems like I can pick either a function switch in the same industry I previously worked in **or** I can keep doing finance stuff in a different industry.

If you are not going through consulting or IB recruitment  (or are a veteran, I think those guys obviously get a pass) you need to really consider whether a pivot is realistic. I knew deep down that pivoting was hard but I guess I deluded myself into thinking I could easily pull it off due to being at an M7.",29,1763594254.0,MBA,5,0.91,False

I'm working with a pretty tight budget, so it seems to be a great option. (Feel free to recommend me other cameras around this price range if you think something would be better)

I'm looking for a lens to go with this camera but I'm not sure where to start. Since I'm in a tight budget I'd like to find one lens that is versatile enough to learn on and use for multiple things. I plan to photograph things such as cars, pretty buildings, sunsets, insides of cool coffee shops, etc. I also do enjoy the look of kinda low light environments and shots at night, so I'd like a decent low light capability if possible. 

I was hoping to get something used in the price range of 100-200 dollars.

My childhood best friend cheated on her longterm partner with my coworker in a nightclub toilet. I understand it might’ve been a drug induced stumble on her part but who knows if it was the first time she’s done something like that? I was in shock so it was a messy mix of concern for him (thinking about marriage and STDs) and my own anger at her lies. I confronted her via text and that led to nowhere she kept denying it and ended the conversation with “Well there we are then I guess, I’m telling the truth and I can’t believe you’d believe him over me.” I had proof she cheated so it just made me upset even more. 

I told my coworker to message her boyfriend on Instagram and it backfired completely. She denied everything, the boyfriend blocked me, she unfriended me, and their entire friend group unfriended me. 

I want to say maybe it was good it ended as I was constantly catching myself talking badly about her to my own family, and I didn't like the negativity I was holding onto especially when it came to picking apart her lifestyle choices etc. I just felt like friends shouldn’t talk like that about each other Ygm?

I want to make new girl friends so but I but my confidence is at an all time low. My gal friends from college fizzled out and I didn’t really meet anyone at my first job,  But that could’ve been due to me keeping to myself mainly. If I did make “friends” it would be with guys as I find them harmless to talk to but they would  just want to date me on the pretence on friendship. These were guys twice my age so I felt like even more of an outcast or a weirdo. I have thoughts like why don’t I know how to make friends with girls my own age? Why tf am I making friends with random men? Is it because im scared of rejection from girls I respect etc?  
It’s not good to assume but I just assume most girls already have friends and they wouldn’t want another one. 


I recently tried to reach out to someone from my hobby class. I asked if she wanted to get coffee, and she initially said she'd love to but was away. A week later, she messaged to say she wasn't ignoring me but had been sick. I wished her well and asked if she was coming to class, and she mentioned she had an audition. I told her to break a leg, she said thanks, and the conversation ended there. I didn't follow up, assuming she wasn't really interested. I don’t really like asking people to hang twice if they say they can’t first time because I’m trying to read the room and make sure I’m not being pushy or trying to invite myself in.

1p1mzhj,https://i.redd.it/1llpc1mnpa2g1.jpeg,The time I overdosed (nightmare scenario),"(Long story)
Last year I was prescribed trazadone by my psych who was generally forgetful and perhaps too nonchalant for her career (to put it lightly). They were 50mg tablets, and she said I could take UP TO 300mg, starting with “1 or 2” pills to see how it affects me and self-adjusting my dosage from there. I was also prescribed an anxiety med AND an anti-psych at the same time by her, which I later found out should not be taken in conjunction with Trazadone. 

One night I took two, and still stayed up until about 4am with little to no side effects, aside from my heart beating a little quicker than usual. So a few weeks later, it was late at night and I couldn’t sleep so took 3 tablets. I remember taking my sheets from the laundry and trying to put them back on my bed when the medication hit me like a TRUCK. All of a sudden, I couldn’t coordinate my movements, if I moved my head at all it felt like I was spinning and I couldn’t hold my limbs up. I abandoned my sheets and laid on my bare mattress, assuming I was about to fall into a deep sleep and I needed to just ride it out. But I didn’t- despite barely being able to move, my mind stayed awake and my heart felt like it was about to pound out of my chest. I tried to check my phone and could barely look at it- everything was spinning and my fingers wouldn’t follow what my brain was telling me to do. The fear paralyzed me and I started to accept that I wouldn’t even be able to call 9/11 or shout for my roommate if I was to die. It took about everything in me to reach 3 feet over for my trash can and desperately slouch over my bed and try to make myself throw up. Eventually I did, and everything went dark from there. 

I woke up the next morning at 2pm. I had work at 4pm that day. I was still in my first week at a new job, a nice restaurant that was very promising and highly competitive. I had to pull strings and got the job solely from a chance connection, and worked alongside folks who have been there at least 4+ years. I was the first new server there in a long time and had a lot of eyes on me. The pressure was insane.
So I wake up and try to rouse myself to get into the shower. As soon as I stand up and start walking, the spinning returns. I remember stumbling and having to catch myself with my arm on the wall to keep from falling down. Panic starts to set in. I somehow made it through my shower, and was still disoriented and spinning. I started to cry and told my roommate what was happening. She kinda gave me a “well shit” and then left for work. I got my clothes on, forced a sandwich and coffee down, took an Adderall (dumb move, but also prescribed with no warning from my psych), and told my family what was happening. I could not bring myself to call out of work in my first week. I also knew I could not drive in this state. I figured I need to just show up- the last few shifts I had just been shadowing another server anyway, it shouldn’t be too difficult to follow someone around. My sister ordered me an uber. It was $40 due to surge pricing from a football game.

I arrive to work, still dizzy and talking slower than usual. I arrive in the kitchen with all the other servers, where the girl I had been shadowing tells me “you’re getting your first section today! Are you excited?!”. Bro. I cannot even describe to you the sinking feeling in my stomach. I knew I had to get out of this. My boss at the time was a guy in his 30s- I didn’t know him very well but he seemed chill and agreeable, so I went in his office and asked to talk. I decided to tell him the truth- I took the recommended dose of a sleeping pill that I was prescribed, and it’s affecting me adversely. I was basically shaking and on the brink of tears when telling him this, knowing how it made me look. All he did was stay silent and listen. His body language was stiff, seeming like he wasn’t buying it. I asked if I could sit in the office this night and finish my computer modules instead of being on the floor. He told me okay but didn’t say much else. I felt totally awful and insecure that he thought I was a junkie. 

2 hours later, I’m still on the computer trying to finish training when I develop a tremor in my hands. This turns into full body tremors, weakness and lightheadedness. I googled trazadone + adderall and found out, to my delight that these medications should not be taken together and can cause serotonin syndrome. The side effects of serotonin syndrome fit my symptoms pretty well, and I started to go into probably my 5th panic attack that day. I told the manager what was happening. He asked what I wanted to do, and I cried and told him I think I need my dad to come pick me up (embarrassing as a 24yr old). I apologized profusely and told him that this was highly embarrassing and not behavior that he should expect from me going forward. He still seemed quiet and judgmental but I called my dad and he picked me up a half hour later. 

I threw all my trazadone out that night and never took it again. During my next appointment, I told my psychiatrist what happened and she acted shocked. It took about four more sessions of her saying “so how’s the trazadone going?” And me repeating this story for her to finally remove it from my file and stop asking. As for the job, I worked there 6 months before being put on a PIP and basically forced to resign, despite me being an incredible server with tons of positive reviews. I had a hunch that management didn’t even like me from the beginning, likely due to the fact that they might’ve felt forced to hire me based on how strong my connection was (someone very high up in corporate that I served at a different restaurant). I also was the only poor person who worked there and had the only crappy car in the employee lot. Regardless, I am happy now and doing what I love. F**** my psychiatrist, F*** that restaurant and F*** trazadone :) ",2,1763593743.0,trazadone,0,1.0,False

Ever daydream about finally kicking that desk job to the curb and spending your days doing... well, *anything* but sitting? Me too! But here's something I've been thinking about lately: are we actually *physically* ready for all that freedom? All those long walks on the beach, gardening sessions, and pickleball tournaments?

I've been stuck behind a screen for way too long, and I started to wonder if my body was quietly staging a revolt. Anyone else feel like their joints creak louder than a rusty gate these days? 😅

So, I've been on a mission to build some simple mobility habits that'll keep me – and hopefully you! – moving freely and happily in retirement. And I’m sharing some of what I've found. No crazy gym memberships or marathon training required!

Here are 3 easy things I've been incorporating:

*   **The ""Stand Up & Stretch"" Power Minute:** Seriously, every hour (set a timer!), just stand up. Reach for the sky, touch your toes (or try to!), and twist a little. It's amazing how much better you feel just by breaking up the sitting cycle. Think of it like watering your plants – a little goes a long way!

*   **The ""Walk & Talk"" Upgrade:** Next time you're on the phone, ditch the couch. Walk around your house, your yard, even just your block. Get those legs moving! Even a brisk 15-minute walk can make a difference. Plus, you might discover a new hidden gem in your neighborhood.

*   **The ""Furniture Friendly"" Workout:** You don't need a fancy gym to get moving! Use your furniture! Do some wall push-ups, chair squats, or even tricep dips using your coffee table (carefully, of course!). It's sneaky exercise that you can weave into your everyday life. Speaking of sneaky, check out this guide with some extra free mobility tips. ""We believe in strongest people.""

Back then, I was dating someone else, and I had to choose between staying with my girlfriend at the time or pursuing something with Miel. I cut ties with Miel purely out of loyalty, not because of my feelings or logic. Even then, I knew it was more likely that something real and long-term could’ve worked with Miel than with the girl who ended up leaving me a year later.

I never went back to Miel afterwards, even though it wasn’t because I didn’t care, it was because I respected her and her choices. The only time we spoke again was maybe 7 years ago. I suggested grabbing a coffee. She asked for time to think, and eventually said no. She told me she didn’t want to suffer again, that she had suffered a lot (as if I hadn’t). I didn’t insist, because I wanted to respect her, but today I realize maybe I should have.

When we cut ties 12 years ago, I was coming from a less privileged academic path than hers, and I started feeling this deep disgust toward myself, like I wasn’t “enough” for her. And so I threw myself into this mission of climbing the social and academic ladder, of becoming someone “worthy.” I ended up fighting my way to a STEM degree in a top school in my country.

And with full honesty (and shame), I have to admit that for the last 9 years, she has been like a ghost behind me, always there in the back of my mind. She became a kind of engine pushing me forward. Because of that, I achieved things academically that I still find unbelievable given where I started. I’m about to finish my studies at MIT, which I’m extremely proud of… and yet, seeing her get married recently, seeing her Instagram stories, hit me like a truck. It made me realize how deeply the love I had for her shaped everything up to today.

To make it worse, she married someone from the same cultural background as mine. She lived the life I dreamed of sharing with her, just with someone else. And yes, I’ll spare you details like the fact that for nearly 10 years, every Saturday I would go to a shopping center near her place because it reminded me of her.

I’ve become aware that I think about her the most when I’m at my worst, like a door back to the last period of my life where I remember truly feeling happy. I know my brain is tricking me because she’s the only form of sincere love I’ve ever known. Besides her, I genuinely feel like nothing and no one has ever loved me (which is I think the main reason of all my drama and could be the subject of another post). I know I idealize her, but I also feel this deep injustice because no one ever saw or believed my sincerity. I was painted as the “asshole” in her eyes while I’ve lived the rest of my life in a kind of mourning.

I always wished her well. I always respected her. And I wish so badly that I could express everything to her once, that she could see for just a moment how much I loved her and what i have done while thinking about her. I want her out of my head, but I feel like if I don’t tell her, it’s going to be impossible. But she’s married now, and there is no way I would ever want to affect her marriage or her happiness. Her happiness is what I always wanted for her. And I know that maybe if I become happy someday, maybe I’ll finally be able to let go. But I don’t know how to be happy, that could be another post too.

Right now, I don’t know what to do. One of her posts showed up on my feed this morning and it ruined my whole day. And I hate this feeling, but a part of me still believes there’s this infinitely small probability that our paths could meet again. I cling to that thought way too much, and it’s clearly not helping me.

I wanted to write more, but honestly I don’t have the strength right now.

1p1mt2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p1mt2s/33f_35m_affair_partner_44f_cheated_on_for_3/,"33F 35M Affair partner 44F Cheated on for 3 months straight, 2 years together. Horrible cruel treatment towards me, need advice?","been with my fiance for 2 years. I found out in August this year that he had been cheating on me since June. I didnt know the extent of it until September. He found her on a dating app, shes 44 years old, hes 35 and I’m 33. They had been talking every single day since June and started seeing each other consistently in July. I even found out that the new paintball team member he was playing with every weekend who was 17 years old, whom he would send me pictures of them together all the time, was actually her son. 

In August we got into a huge argument because I found a box of condoms in his truck, we didnt use condoms. He lied saying they were for us because he wanted to practice safer sex. I immediately knew he was lying. He got physical with me that night, I rushed towards him because I was so upset yelling at him, and he shoved me so hard 3 separate times that I went flying across his apartment and smacked my entire body on his hardwood floor face down, he shoved me again and I flew over his couch I literally saw stars. Then we got into a pushing match and he held me in a choke hold on the floor, laying on his back and I was on my back on top of him.

He said I couldnt come to his apartment anymore because the neighbors complained about the loud yelling. About a week later, I came over to talk about things and he was getting ready to go on a date. He told me he was about to go to the laundry mat and that the laundry mat was “super busy” at like 6 pm, something in my gut told me he was lying so I showed up unnanounced. He freaked out and said he was going out with the boys to the bar. I said no you’re not. He said fine, I’m going on a date. I begged him not to go, he walked out to his car and I got into his passenger seat. He came around and scooped me out of the car and we both fell onto the pavement. I walked back to my car crying and he came to my window and said “If you’re still here when I get back I’ll call the cops. If we’re meant to be together then we will be.” 

He said he only saw her once after that night, but turns out she said that was like their 20th date. He told me he left her in the movie theater that night because he felt so guilty and immediately tried to call me. That was also a lie, because she said she went home with him that night, they slept together and stayed in bed drinking coffee all morning (found this out days later). 

I woke up to an email from him the next day saying he was so sorry, that he needs me, loves me and made a huge mistake. I took him back. He told me the name of the woman he was seeing and I found her social media. I asked her how long he’d been sleeping with her and she told me “multiple times a week since July” she didnt know about me, he told her I was a crazy ex and that we broke up a year ago. Not true. The entire month of September she said he told her they were exclusive but that was a lie because we were obviously still seeing each other too, although he said he was “busy” more and barely put any effort into our relationship, it became more just about sex for him and no emotion. After he found out me and her had been talking, he “chose” me and said he’d stop talking to her. This was in October. That weekend I went over to his place for a few days and he made comments like “Dont start arguing with me, dont make me regret my decision.” I was so mad. 

He made so many backhanded comments blaming me for his cheating, saying he was unhappy and thats why he cheated, telling me details about their sex life - how she gave him better sex, how she felt better and tasted better, how she gave him massages, was more sensual, and how she touched him lovingly and tenderly unlike me. We got into 3 arguments about the affair that weekend, he would flip from crying in my lap saying how sorry he was, how it should have never happened, to being angry that I kept bringing it up. At 2 am when he was sleeping right next to me, he texted her saying “we got into a fight again, I think I made the wrong choice. can I see you again?” She said she’d tell me he said that, so when I woke up he confessed to sending her that text. I called her on his phone and begged her to block him and she refused saying she feels like he has more to say to her and that she feels like the victim in all of this. 

He promised me he wouldnt talk to her anymore, I told him if he does we’re over. A couple days later, I asked her if he was still talking to her, she said yes. He denied it. When I confronted him that she said they were, he says “I asked her to meet up with me tomorrow, I need to know if I’m making the right choice. I dont want to regret this for years. I’m sorry it sucks but its true.” I told him we’re over and he said “Ok I wish you the best.” A week later, he sends me 24 text messages proclaiming his love for me, that he “made a mistake and that we’re soulmates, saying she isnt my person, you are a part of my soul. I’m coming over right now to pick you up (at 6 am) to get my heart and soul. I love you too much to keep effing this up.”

I got into his car and he was super sexual with me immediately. Making out with me, etc. I was like what is going on? He told me she was just using him, seeing other guys and just wanted to “win”. She called him while we were in the car talking about this. I knew something wasnt right. We got to his place and he started acting really shady, pacing around and acting agitated. He told me he needed to take the call, he goes outside in the hallway, I open the door and see him texting her. He comes back inside and says “This was a mistake. We need to go now. It was a misunderstanding, she says she wants me and only me.” I said what is a misunderstanding?? He said “she saw me on bumble the other day but his profile was on snooze.” Bull. I know he was on the dating apps still cuz he said he saw me on there too while we were talking in the car.

He said “Get your stuff now. I need to take you back home.” I asked him if she was telling him to do that and he said yes. Unbeknownst to me, he started recording our conversation for her on his phone. We get into his truck and he said (while recording for her) “I want to be with you but I want to be with her more.” I said “Are you so smitten by her that you’re willing to throw away our love after 2 years?” he said “Yes.” I said “You dont have a future with her. She already has 3 grown kids. What are you gonna do? Have a baby with her and when the kid is 5 she’ll be 50?” he said “Maybe!” I was crying and heartbroken. He was furiously texting her the entire time, and took a picture of the freeway for her to prove he was driving me home. I said “can you please stop texting her the entire drive home out of respect for me?” He said “Yeah one sec.” and continued to do it the entire 40 min drive.

I said “What about the 24 text messages saying we were soulmates and that she wasnt your person??” He said “I thought I meant it but I dont know now.” I said “I loved you with my entire soul. I cant believe you’re doing this to me.” He said “Do you really mean that?” I said “Yes!” I got out of his car, he grabbed his gnomes that he kept in my front yard and left. I didnt hear from him for a week again, I contacted him to come get his stuff he left in my garage. He said he thinks about me every night, that he’s still in love with me. I asked him if he’s really happier with her and he said hes not happy. I told her all of this and she didnt believe me, she said next time record the call or I wont consider it. She started getting really rude with me so I just said whatever, you can have him, hes a habitual liar. 

He even lied to her in a group chat between the 3 of us saying he never kissed me or did anything sexual with me in the truck that day he picked me up. Literally lied to my face for her when he knew what really happened (more than kissing). Then, he told me he got a new promotion at work and is making a lot more money now and she was going to take him out this past monday to celebrate. Well, that was a lie too because she told me no, monday was her birthday and he was taking her out. She said they’re going to see each other every thursday and friday for the forseeable future. He said in the group chat, “I’m sorry I hurt you, I feel guilty, I do care about you but I care about her too and need to see if its real. I’ll let you know one way or another.”

I saw so many pictures, naked pics of her etc on his secret phone that I didnt even know he had. He would send me the same naked pictures of himself to both of us. I saw the loving texts her sent her saying he wanted to be in bed with her rubbing her back again, how amazing and perfect she is, etc. He told me he “loves us both and wants to be with both of us.” He would have sex with both of us on the same day sometimes. For months he would see her on saturday and me on sunday. I am disgusted.

He didnt do anything for our 2 year anniversary in August. I asked him if he got me flowers, he laughed and said yeah they’re at the store. Yet when she left him for a few days after finding out about me, he sent her a huge bouqet of flowers to her door.

A couple months ago he lied and told me he went to the mountains with his guy friend, said there wouldnt be service there so he couldnt use his phone. Called me that morning and said his guy friend was about to be there and that he loved me. Turns out he actually took her to the mountains that entire weekend. I have blocked both of them. It seems like he just assumed I would always be there waiting for him whenever he gets done with her. The way he treated me was so horrible and heartbreaking. I dont understand it. He went from someone that loved me to such a cruel person. I need some advice please?

TLDR; Cheated on for 3 months straight after 2 years together. He fell in love with both of us. So many lies. He was extremely cruel to me and still kept saying he was in love with me. She is 44, he is 35. I am 33.",1,1763593303.0,BreakUps,3,1.0,False
1p1msaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1p1msaq/dogs_diagnosed_with_kidney_disease_our_experience/,Dogs diagnosed with kidney disease - our experience with diet and meds,"Hi all. We recently lost our 9-year old Shih Tzu mix to kidney disease, but I was able to keep her with us for 19 months after her diagnosis (when the vet gave us only days or weeks). It was congenital – born with only one kidney and the one kidney was not in great shape. I see a lot of posts here with people in similar situations, so the best way I know to honor her is to share what we did for her. I will say it is not easy, cheap, or even feasible for everyone.

The following is ***NOT*** veterinary advice, just my own experience:

* We started with Science Diet K/D, and she hated it after about three days. We had to move on to homemade food. For all of the below items, the freshness of the food made a difference to her.
* Each day, we fed her boiled white rice (minute rice) and a mix of protein (see below). It was about a 2 to 1 ratio by volume. Depending on the size of your dog, you would need to judge the amount.
* I read they are supposed to have a “low protein” diet, but we had success with high-quality protein. I cooked boneless, skinless, chicken thighs and breasts, pan-seared salmon, and occasionally the smallest amount of brined/marinated chicken to give her some salt intake.
* For supplements, we got her Epakitin and AminAvast. Epakitin is a phosphate binder and AminAvast is for kidney support. I truly believed these helped.
* Our vet prescribed Enalapril for blood pressure, because this is a thing with kidney disease.
* Fruits and vegetables – we gave her snacks (as much as she would eat, but not more than ½ cup per day) of blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, apples, carrots, and green beans.
* She loved her old kibble (Royal Canin or Purina Pro Plan), so I took a scoop of this and put it in a coffee grinder to make “kibble dust”. I sprinkled this on her food to add flavor when she was not in the mood to eat anything else. This worked well for her since a full serving of kibble was too high in phosphates.
* Similar to the above, we ground up Cheerios into dust for flavor (she loved Cheerios).
* We left water out for her all day and she was trained to use pee pads, and we felt this was an important factor.
* We walked her short distances, but only to get mild exercise – about 20% of what she used to do.

She ate more on some days and less on others, and gradually her weight declined. We felt that the more she ate, the more she had to process, and so her body “knew” when it couldn’t handle more. She did not vomit or have diarrhea regularly with the above diet.

This was a difficult process, and we decided on euthanasia only when she began having trouble walking, as she continued to enjoy most aspects of life up until that point. Her healthy weight was 16-17 lbs. and she was down to about 11 when she passed.

I hope this helps in some way, and I wish you all the very best of luck.",5,1763593252.0,DogAdvice,4,1.0,False
