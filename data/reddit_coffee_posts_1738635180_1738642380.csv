I know it'd be an indirect measurement, but kinda got the idea from different industries measuring many different things like alcohol content, sugar content, and even TDS in coffee. So now I'm wondering if brix could be used to measure TDS with the appropriate conversion factor?",1,1738642326.0,Hydroponics,0,1.0,False
1ih98ne,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ih98ne,Tiga Time (Feat. Dyna,"Hello, I’m back but with small little doodlings of the funny Bird man (Plus a quick sneak peek at Dyna !) Just wanted to post something quick as I’m working on a special post and this time around it’s not about an ultra but instead one of the *non* ultra heros that we’ve been giving, so you may cast your guesses on who is the special little guy in line for a reimagining.
———————————★———————————
But yeah, Honestly I just wanted to draw birds this time around as I FINALLY mapped out Tiga’s plumage and figured out how to deal with those wings of his, basically Tiga can switch between arms and wings at will so he has the best of both worlds, he can now punch and grab things but also fly when he needs to and his tail was changed too to something more raptor-like (specifically for Multi-type) overall, I’m very happy with his design and I’m wondering what other birds I can base the others (Tigger, Decker, Camearra) on, I’ve already got a few in mind and most of them are all birds of prey except for Dynas who is actually based off chickens, a rooster specifically, though I guess he halfway counts as chickens have been known to eat mice, snakes, lizards apparently, tbh based off my research on chickens those little guys will eat anything since they’re omnivorous.

Why I chose roosters specifically for Dyna ? It’s because I felt like it fit as Roosters are actually tough little dudes, they’ll fight hawks if it means protecting their hens, hell even hens are willing to fight back too if they feel that they need to protect their chicks, Chickens can mean business and I love that about them, they’re one of my favorite birds as a matter of fact !
———————————★———————————
Anyways onto showcasing the actual doodles which are quite simple this time around:

- the first is Tiga having tea or coffee, he’s very fluffy in this and it’s adorable which will distract you from the fact that he subsists off flesh and is still part of the “terror bird” group of Ultras who are notoriously ruthless. Honestly it makes you wonder if giving him caffeine is a good idea as he might get very hyper and going absolutely stupid, either way it’s the fault of whoever gave him the beverage and any damages Tiga might’ve caused will come out of their paycheck. Honestly idk if giving Ultras caffeine in general is a good idea because who the hell knows how their bodies process and react to it, half of the ultra taxonomic family doesn’t even eat therefore likely hasn’t had the beverage and the other half probably  hasn’t had or was even allowed to have a sip because of the possibility of them going batshit and destroying every breakable object in sight.

- Second Image is just a clearer diagram of Tiga’s plumage, its black and white in this ofc but in the best way i can possibly say it, the darker grey is blue, lighter grey is red, the black is, well, black and those little spots are either red, yellow, or black depending on where they are on his body. And to top it all off, he has angry little spot brows and it’s very whimsical. I added black to Tiga’s plumage as a nod to Tiga Dark and as a way of representing “impurity”, the idea in my headcanons for Tiga was that his choice of following the path of light was a chance of redemption and to become a better person and in turn, the hero we know him as today, with any dark feathers slowing shedding off his plumage overtime signifying his growth into a better man, of course this would take time, as all change does since to grown and change as a person is a slow and delicate process and even still your gonna have flaws as with change, can come new obstacles which is perfectly okay and shouldn’t stop you from striving to be the best version of yourself you can be, and to be honest I think that an imperfect hero is more interesting; despite the near godlike status ultras carry with them, they’re still living creatures with flaw, Tiga himself being no different.

- and lastly, our quick little sneak peek of Dynas, who is ravaging a kitchen cabinet, because he just does that, Ultras are funny little critters, they’re simultaneously the most graceful yet awkward creatures humans have had the chance to interact with, it’s like they’re doing their best to act normal but at the same time, earth is still a weird little place for Ultras and they always like to know what’s happening, Tiga is especially curious, pecking and clawing at whatever caught his interest while making a soft but rather growly “cooing” sound; for an eagle/hawk thing, Tiga tends to croak, growl, hiss and coo more than screech, hell the guy will squeak and trill more often since screeching seems to exclusively be a death warning. Tbh it’s better to approach a trilling Tiga than a screeching one, hell ask any member of GUTS that had the displeasure of working with Tiga as he decided to unleash a death call that mind you, is absolutely deafening, Trilling or cooing is usually a sign that Tiga is in a good mood as he’s almost always calm whilst doing so

1ih98en,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1ih98en/got_my_closure_dont_waste_your_time/,Got my closure: Don’t waste your time!," So today I went for coffee with my ex to talk about why he was so distant, that I felt there was animosity, he said he’s just distant like that with his friends. 

 We of course ended up talking about the relationship, when he broke up with me he said he’s avoidant, incapable of love, none of it was my fault, I was a great girlfriend. He just can’t have a relationship, he’ll probably die alone.

 But today, 7 weeks later he tells me he also stopped liking me and lied and said he told me this when he broke up with me. He said he stopped liking me because I “cried too much” and was too sensitive (I think I cried 3 times throughout our relationship, 1 of those was about a movie, 1 was not about him). He said it didn’t matter if it wasn’t about him, that I “scared” him, and he didn’t know how I would react to things.

 So to summarize, because this continued for 4 hours of even more bizarre and contradictory statements.

And they're finally ready to share- They want to open (targeting this September) a giant Christmas retail store in Arizona- to sell all their holiday decor passion items. They then proceed to describe their clueless, ass-backward, childlike vision for a store guaranteed to be bankrupt before they even roll out a welcome mat. 

Leave it to Kylie and Shelly to 'launch their business idea' by going shopping. No mention of a business plan, market research, relevant work experience, networking/talking to other gift shop owners, just shopping for 'inventory'. 

I'm sure they believe their passion is the key to success but just looking at the napkin math (which I guarantee they have not)- it's pretty obvious this is a vanity, hobby project at best-- Rent for a small boutique in their area- $6000-$12000/month. 2 employees at minimum wage to keep the store open- $9000/month, Insurance, Utilities, Operating costs maybe $2000/month. So they need to generate say $20,000/month to even unlock the door. 

They are in no position to think about what they 'want' to sell. Retail is about finding what moves, and negotiating the best price with a wholesaler.  If they sold a roll of ribbon and managed to carve out a $5 profit on every roll of ribbon sold- that would be a miracle- and that would require them to sell 4000 rolls of ribbon a month to cover costs. You gotta sell what moves--- not just what Kylie fan-girls over. 

I admit- I'd love to open a shop with my mom without a care in the world for profit or prospects- just something we both love and then we'd just hang around the counter all day drinking coffee and greeting shoppers-- and more power to them if their youtube fame has set them up to be hobbyist gift shop owners. But, I don't actually believe they're rich enough to survive being that stupid.

My prediction- they'll keep filling up those storage rental units all year with anything they fancy buying- without a moments thought for margin (difference between wholesale and retail), turnover time (how many units it will sell a day, a week in their store), exclusivity (will they be 1 of a dozen stores that sell it? will they have the best price?) And then when the time comes to sign a 3-5 year lease for an actual store- and all the other expenses-- someone will hold a calculator up to their noses and they'll realize they got in a little too deep. Eventually, an online store will launch but by that time their 'inventory' will have been sitting in storage for a few years and they'll just recoup what they can selling it off as 'mystery boxes' to future generations.

All that said- I do think 'Dingbats' could be a cute name for their shop. ",1,1738642277.0,Crazymiddles,0,1.0,False

1ih95uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1ih95uw/friends_come_in_many_different_forms/,friends come in many different forms,"I was complaining to a friend about how another friend has been ""ignoring"" me recently by saying they're busy for the next two weeks, but they have time to quickly check whatsapp, but not respond much to me. But then this friend I was complaining to said he had a friend who used to complain to him, but when he wanted support she'd walk away. That's not ok, but then he realized this:

""I realised in our life different people come and stay for different purposes. Some people are excellent for time pass. Some are pathetic in a coffee table relaxed chat  but they might come and help you at 2 am in the night; some are not rich but will lend you money immediately if you need it - but they might not spend time with you and so on.""

Then I realized all the good things my friend I was complaining about did for me. When my dad was really ill and couldn't help me at a music performance I was doing, my friend jumped in at the last minute and helped out, and even followed up and asked later how my dad was doing. He helped me pack things when I moved apartments. He kept me company on hikes. Right now he's going through a rough spell of being in a training program he dislikes, plus doing dissertation work, plus looking for jobs. The least i can do, I realized, is give him the space he has said he needs, and be there for him in spirit. 

So know that certain friends aren't going to be everything for you, I know that sounds obvious, and you can't be everything to them either. So just offer what you can, and they'll offer what they can. When I saw it this way, I realized wow, there are so many caring people in my life. I'm not alone, and I've also got a lot to offer. 

Hope this helps for whomever feels they don't have friends.

1ih91mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestAMotorcycle/comments/1ih91mm/looking_for_my_first/,Looking for my first,"In the market for a beginner's bike.  Not only because I've never ridden before, but also because my ideal ride is putting about on the back roads, little trip to the coffee shop, that sort of thing.  I want low and slow, probably breaking 50mph at most (on average).  Of course there will be the ever so rare trip with buddies, maybe to a \*further\* coffee shop.  In which case yeah I'll probably hit highway's and have to keep up.

  
Honestly first pick was an ol' Rebel 250. Wanted it as a kid, they're available all day - but I am a 6' man clocking in around 230lbs.  I think I weigh more than that bike.  But it's non-intimidating, and kind of looks like a motorized bicycle, which I like.  My dad's advice is ""Get larger than you think you need"", which would put my \*reasonable\* pick around maybe a Shadow 1100.

  
What I want is a small... nimble is key.  Small, nimble, kind of light.  Maybe do an adv/ scrambler conversion down the road.  That sort of thing.  Sportster/Cafe racer-ish.  Narrow frame, mid-controls, classic cruiser look - Hopefully not look like I stole a kid's bike.

  
I read an interesting take - ""It's fun to go fast on a SLOW bike, it's NOT fun to go slow on a FAST bike.""  I feel that.

  
A few that I found locally in my price range (assuming these aren't bait posts)  Not afraid of a little project but require a title.

  
Sportster 883, I like it as is except prev. owner added ape hangars.

  
Suz M50, I like the \*looks\* of the bike a LOT, but it's more of a ""big boy"" cruiser than I'm really looking for.  Probably the largest physical bike on the list.  How does it handle doing maybe 12mph?  Lane splitting?

  
Suz Intruder 800, from the looks of it, Suz's answer to the Sportster, albeit with a direct drive.

  
Rebel 450, I like it a LOT, worry if I'm \*still\* too large of a person for the bike though.  Also likely the rarest bike on my list and I'd probably have long waits on replacement parts.  Cheapest on the list too, by a grand.

  
What about the other 250 cruisers?  Everyone calls the Rebel 250 the goat small cruiser (at least regarding MSF Courses), but is there anything like it that a larger person could ride around legitimately?  Maybe the Yamaha one?  Vstar 250?

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ih90m3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ih90m3/getting_overinvested_early_on_and_dry_texting/,Getting over-invested early on and dry texting,"So I recently met this girl on hinge who is really great! We texted for a week or so and then went on a coffee date and it went really really well! The conversation flowed, we were both asking questions back and forth and just all around super into it. At the end of the date, two times she said something like “this was so much fun we need to hang out again” so I was like okay this is great! Afterwards I texted her thanking her for meeting me and saying that too and she said it again so I was like awesome I’ll plan the next one!

Flash forward a few days - we do have another date planned next weekend, but I kind of have a lot of thoughts and emotions going on right now.

First, I feel like after just 1 good date I’m super invested and even more interested in this girl. Which is great, but it’s to the point where I don’t feel like talking to any of my other hinge matches anymore because of it and I feel like that’s a recipe for disaster if this doesn’t work out. I don’t know how to just be less invested though if I really like her.

Second, like I said before she is absolutely amazing to talk to in person, but over text she is kind of dry. She’s in law school right now so I get that responses can take a while and that doesn’t bother me. BUT when the responses  do come they either ignore jokes I made or parts of my previous texts where I’m talking about what I’m doing and are instead just direct answers to any questions I asked so it’s kind of hard to keep a conversation going. Under other circumstances I would say her texts read like she isn’t interested in me, but based on everything she’s said and how well our date went I would find that hard to believe, especially if she agreed to a second date.

I don’t know what to do (if anything) I really really like her and am excited for our next date but have no idea how much bearing someone’s texting style should have on anything. Is the solution here to just chill out lol?",1,1738641577.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

My daughter is 5 months old today and for the last 2.5 months has been such a good sleeper. Suddenly that has all come crashing down, we are up every 2-3 hours. I know these things happen when she’s growing or developing a new skill, etc. and I don’t mind getting up with her. I honestly just want to complain to someone who gets it. My milk supply is crap right now because I have not been resting properly between caring for her, getting up all night, and taking care of the home. Again, I don’t want advice. I am in a phase of life. Just complain with me please. 

On the other hand, my baby is healthy, happy, so much fun, and the light of my entire life. I love being her mama and will continue to be sleepy as long as she still needs me at night. I will comfort her through it all. 

I just wanted to get off my chest how exhausted I am. The end.

Her mood swings are out of control, her shoes don't fit, and she's starting to waddle to a socially prohibitive degree. Her anxiety is also over the roof, as she kicks Jack out of the house, because his breathing is annoying her. She even makes some extremely snarky comments, like ""When you get done talking with your girlfriend, can you bring up some toilet paper?"" He just so happens to be on the phone with Miguel, so he invites Jack to the golf club to give Rebecca some space. We then see Rebecca saying to him as he's leaving, ""Thanks again for the bathroom sex at Froggy's!"" Jack did see the father he does not want to be, as Rebecca is walking to the nearest store to get Jack a cake for his birthday. She ended up at a liquor store, with a recipe for an almond chocolate cake, and unfortunately, they don't have the ingredients at the liquor store. They give her some icing and a muffin, and voila a birthday cake!

We then see Dr. K and Joe, the fireman who brought Randall to the hospital, having some challenges. Dr. K is learning how to live after his wife of fifty-three years passed away from cancer, and Joe is working on trying to save his marriage. We see Dr. K struggling with simple matters of widower reality. His wife's things are still occupying half the closet, her meds are still neatly lining the cabinet shelves, and her hair tools are strewn about as though freshly used. That house is a shrine to her, but a prison to him. We see him doing the same things he would do with her. His son Peter is worried too, as he visits with his wife and kids to convince Dr. K to consider moving forward. Eventually, Dr. K did move forward, and part of it was because of Jack and Rebecca. 

Joe, the fireman had plans to adopt Randall himself. Him and his wife, Samantha were going through a stage where they were constantly angry at each other. He went to the priest to ask for a miracle, and here Randall comes. Joe thinks the answer is Randall, but Samantha disagrees. He was ready to get a car seat and everything, but she told him to take Randall to the hospital, and figure out another way to save the marriage. While Joe is at the hospital, Samantha realized his gesture came from a good lace. A handshake and coffee date saved their marriage. This is how we know Randall was a blessing, coming into this world. Not only, did he save a marriage, he filled a hole in multiple people's hearts, like Jack and Rebecca, Joe and Samantha, and even Dr. K. This episode showed that people go through tough times, but anything can be fixed up. People can choose to give up, or continue fighting. There is light at the end of the tunnel, for everyone, whether that is a deep tunnel or not. Randall, you are a blessing!

Right now we have a lot of input and little output because unfortunately since we don't live over there people end up stealing some of it and selling it themselves. How do we get more organized? Is there someone we can hire? Do I have to essentially move there or be going back and forth?

So far I've done some research on it but I end up falling into loopholes and getting confused. Any advice is much appreciated! :) For context: I am 22 years old and my dad wants me not only to help him right now, but to take over if anything happens to him in the future, so I really just want to be prepared and know what l'm doing when it comes to managing such a huge thing.

1ih8vd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ih8vd7/svt_tachycardia_happening_more_often/,SVT Tachycardia happening more often,"I'm 24F, 160 cm, 60 kg, don't smoke or drink alcohol (I used to drink more last year, but not very often and not too much still), don't drink coffee either. I also do sport twice a week, and other days I go for walks, but I recognise I should be more active (I come from a sedentary lifestyle and have sport related trauma so I prefer to take it slow improving on that). Since I was 10, I have sudden tachycardias that get up to about 230 bpm, and they stop as suddenly after 5-20 min. This used to happen only about once per year, and I had many tests done (EKG, echography...) but nothing conclusive as the tachycardia wasn't happening in the moment of the tests. Last year I had a really long one that lasted almost 2 hours, so the ambulance came home and they could perform the EKG while I had it, and it had to be stopped administering a drug via blood. After that, I went to my doctor's office, showed her the EKG and had so many tests done (blood tests, more EKGs while normal...) and I was diagnosed with SVT: supra ventricular tachycardia. In May, I had surgery (catheter ablation) and they told me it had gone reeeally well, saying ""99.9% we think it won't return EVER"". 
Well, last week (not even a year after) I got a tachycardia, it was about 190 bpm for about 10 minutes. I was so sad the surgery could have failed... I had a phone doctor's appointment yesterday to renovate my contraceptive pills anyways so I told her about it, and she told me it's so rare that after ablation the symptoms come back, that I should get an EKG while I have it (it's impossible to go to the hospital and get it done that fast, unless it lasts more than 40 min or even more). She told me to keep track of when they happen and how long they last, but not to worry because probably it's a one-time thing and not related to the SVT. She also told me I can keep taking the contraceptive pills, that it doesn't affect that because my blood coagulation is good and I don't have other heart conditions. 
Well, I just had another tachycardia, only a week after the last one. I woke up in the middle of the night, I was calm thinking of showering and going for breakfast in the morning, and suddenly BAM, 230 bpm for 7 minutes at 4 am. I feel fine after, only a little bit tired, and like I need to pee. But now I'm worried they messed up my heart in surgery, or that I developed another worse condition.
Tomorrow I'll talk with my mom and we'll for sure go to the doctor and cardiologist soon, we're in Spain so it can be a bit slow but the money isn't a problem. I'm just looking for some insight of what can be happening because right now I'm scared that it's going to impact my life or it's something dangerous. I've always had health anxiety so I try not to stress about every little thing that happens to me, but I want to know if I SHOULD stress in this case. ",1,1738641088.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1ih8v3h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1ih8v3h/mil_is_legally_crazy_by_the_state/,MIL is legally crazy by the state,"Hello Charlotte and fans! I need help and thoughts. Because I’m ready to protect myself but my husband won’t let me. I’ll give you some early incidents in short before the main story yesterday. 

The very first time I ever met my MIL was when she backed into my car and blamed me for it. No… I was not in the car. And no… I did not park poorly. I was on the other side of the street and off to the side away from the driveway. MIL was made that my husband (BF at the time) had not told her he was dating someone. 

I joined for Christmas Eve supper at his uncles house where she got angry that the conversation did not loop back to her. She chose to get up and pout on the couch like a toddler. My husband told her to shape up and rejoin the family or leave. 

MIL and I work at the same locations at times. She is a contract employee and I am technically her boss. This is how husband and I met was through this job actually. Which also made me husbands boss at times. However he is the lead of his team and I am the lead of mine. MIL threatened to report me for not having a conversation with her in regard to a lost and found item when I was at that time assisting with a high stress situation. Think 150 people angry in that high stress situation vs. a lost phone. I was doing my job as manager of the situation. 

As for yesterday….
My husband and I recently moved for his new job. We got married a few weeks ago because of this job and health insurance (US health insurance sucks). MIL was cordial at the supper and there were no problems. She had been trying in the past few months to change her attitude and wanted to build a relationship with me. I was not opposed and told my husband as such. He asked if she could come and check out the new place along with his grandparents (the folks who truly raised him). I said that was ok. She had never been to the previous place and had never met our cat.

I am very clear about boundaries and how I feel. I am not one to hid how I feel to him. However I do not pick fights or go out of my way to engage in arguments or hard conversations with his mother. 
When husband’s grandparents and MIL first arrived, outside of them being 45 minutes early from when we told them to be at the new place, everything was going fine. MIL liked the decorations. Everyone liked the apartment. MIL asked about some lighting I had put in our bedroom as she wanted to do something similar to her sunroom. I told her how to do the lights and how they worked. While husband and I are legally married, we have not had the full wedding and celebration. I mentioned the wedding and some of the plans. My mom and I are going to be looking at venues soon. MIL of course asked about the dress, what she should wear, what flowers there would be. Husband and I haven’t decided anything yet other than the date, the wedding parties, and the color scheme. MIL immediately said “I’m assume I’m not invited to the dress fittings?” 

I’ll be honest…. I hate shopping. So the only person who will for sure be there is my mom. I want to be in and out of the shop without getting overwhelmed. I told her as such. She seemed disappointed. Husband backed me up. 

Visit continues and MIL and husband start to argue as they do. Anything from government policy’s to climate change to personal life, including me. His grandparents just sit and avoid the argument. Husband’s nana tried to chat with just me, knowing how uncomfortable I was (this isn’t the first time and nana is a beautiful soul). Husband and MIL continue until MIL tells my husband he “can enjoy his death.” 

I had had it. I told her she was not allowed to speak to him like that or any of us present. That was incredibly rude and she does not get to say that in my house. OUR house. If she didn’t like that, she could leave. So she did. She stormed out, slamming the door behind her. She attempted to call the grandparents, and Pops told her to shape up and quit arguing. It clearly disturbs everyone and what she said was uncalled for and rude. She comes back to the apartment and apologizes for her behavior. My husband told her she doesn’t get to say things like she did and he is looking out for his family. MIL took that as she is no longer his family and that only I am the family. She again got angry. 

While that conversation/argument occurred, nana asked about a few objects I had on the coffee table. I have incense burners of all kinds. I asked if she wanted to see, and pulled out a downflow incense cone to show her what happens. It takes me about 2-3 minutes to get it lit and going. After 5+ minutes, MIL freaks out about the incense and how that affects her medically and she could end up in the hospital dead! She storms out a second time in 45 minutes. Both husband and I forgot she had sent issues, but we also have a lot of wall flowers and scents in the apartment, including candles and such. Yet it’s the act of me burning incense that’s triggers her. And for those that are still with me, yes, she did ask about flowers at the wedding and what kinds and wanted to show me arrangements. So I guess flowers, candles, and wall flowers are ok but incense aren’t? 

After she stormed out a second time, I started to have a panic attack. I’ve had a lot recently as the move was stressful and I have quit all jobs for the sake of my husbands job. I have nothing but this apartment, him, and our cat at this new place. I’m incredibly stressed and heightened and emotional. I am looking into therapists since this hasn’t happened in a long time for me. 

We chose to try one more time at supper and MIL complained the entire time. It was to cold. Food was too expensive (it was Applebees before 6pm so happy hour). She said we needed the waitress right away because we wanted to order before the food got more expensive. I have worked in customer service for the past 12 years. I did not take kindly to her attitude towards those helping us, but didn’t say anything. My husband recognized I was agitated. Ultimately, she didn’t engage in conversation with the rest of the family and chose to scroll on her phone about 85% of the supper. When there was a problem with nana’s food, she also chose to make a scene with a leg cramp at the table, complaining that we should just chop her leg off. Not 10 minutes later, and it’s the other leg and same issue! And it’s my fault because I lit the incense and I should have known better. It was my fault. Because it’s always the “wifey’s” fault as she now calls me. 

I started to have another panic attack and excused myself. I left and sat in the car until husband left. Husband said he apologized to the waitresses and gave them the money I left behind for them. I did not say goodbye to the family because I was not in a good space to do so. 

So sorry this is long. This is the last bit. 

An hour ago, MIL sent a message in the group chat including husband, grandparents, uncle, and me. Her are the small bits involving me, direct quotes from the message. I am leaving some out because it pertains to husbands and MILs argument from earlier. 

“I really like your house. It seems comfortable and that there is plenty of room to be comfortable and move around.  I have been slowly going through the process of decluttering.  Glad you don’t have this tendency. The rooms seem good sized.  I’ll have to come one day and you can teach me pickle ball. With your wife’s permission of course.”

“I am very sorry for the first half of me leaving. OP and I are both strong personalities which seem to clash.  I will continue to try to be the bigger person.”

“The incense was so rude on her part.  I can not help that I have sMCAD, POTS and vEDS.  Just like you can not control having EDS and POTS.  I was still having cramping in my groins at 2am.  Fragrances can send me to the hospital.  It’s bad enough that I have lost two jobs due to my diseases that I have no control over.  Then I’m at my son’s home and have to sit in the foyer because your wife with no concern for my health lights incense.  I don’t know what to do but making me sick is going to further drive a wedge between us.”

“And I really don’t know what that was at dinner.  Getting up and leaving and never coming back to say goodbye, or thank you for dinner. I’m assuming she went to the car.  Why I don’t know but that’s just rude.  We drove an hour and a half to see you both and your home.”

I’ve decided I’m done and I will no longer be attending functions with his family involving his mother. Husband and I want kids. But I finally said I won’t allow that until she is put in her place. I will not be having kids knowing that she will abuse them just as she did to him. Because no matter what happens after kids, I know she will tell them and my husband that I am always the one at fault. I am always to blame. I am always a terrible person. And I don’t want her to do that to my children. So right now, I will not have kids with my husband. 

That has upset my husband. But I can’t bring kids into this world if they are only going to be abused by MIL and she will continue to emotionally abuse me.

1ih8sw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1ih8sw8/i_cant_be_tired/,I can't be tired.,"I'm a 16 year old, living in Germany. I was born in Brazil, my parents got divorced at 6 and I moved to India at 8, where I learned English in a small (almost cult like lol) village. I lived there for 4 years, and that's the place I felt like I belonged to. That place was my life for a really, really long time, and all of my friends were there. I used to be extremely extraverted, bubbly and energetic, not really having shame in general-- my nickname was cara de pau (wooden face, in Portuguese, meaning someone with no shame whatsoever). The plan was for me to move to Germany after two years, but for complications I stayed there for an extra two, learning and becoming fluent in English. 

But eventually, everything changed again. I was brought back to Brazil, to live with my grandparents for half a year-- probably the most depressed I've ever been. And then, everything changed AGAIN, where I moved into Germany with my other parent. I've been here for around 2-3 years now, but it's so exhausting. I'm trying so, so hard to learn German. To do what I did back then, to become fluent and find my place here, but it's just not the same. I have a few friends. I have food, and shelter. I wouldn't say I'm not loved, but sometimes it does feel that way. I'm lonely. I've become more and more drawn into my own shell. I've lived a great life, that people would be jealous of, of course. 

But I just wish that I could move to a country that spoke English. I'm currently 16 in the 8th grade, for dumb German law reasons I was held back two years because my German wasn't good enough (they never tested me). My German isn't fluent, but it's not the worst, I can get around perfectly well and have a small chat with someone without many major errors. My whole life I've felt like I never had just a moment to breathe, to settle down and experience life in a normal way. I'd die to walk into a store and be able to speak to the cashier in English, or Portuguese, about anything really. The weather. The stuff happening around the world. Anything. I feel so isolated. I want to get to the 10th grade, so badly. But I failed, again and again. I've missed so many classes just because I can't bring myself to leave my bed. Life is just trying my best to get through today, and reach tomorrow.  I feel embarrassed, I'm a failure academically. I've kind of given up on a lot of things. I don't sleep most days, just distracting myself with anything, dreading 6 am where I have to get dressed and leave for school.

I don't get to be tired. I have to keep going, no matter what. I have to get good grades, to learn German, to get back to the 10th grade. I might even move to Portugal, where my other parent is currently living, and then I'd have to start all over again. I'm scared, and I want to say I'm tired, but I'm not. I refuse to be tired. I can't be tired, not with my life right now. I wake up at 6 am, pack my bag, put my clothes on, then leave to get a tram at 7. I ride the subway for 45 minutes to get to school, where I stay until 13. Then I come home, and usually pass out from not sleeping the last night. Then I wake up at 20ish, and the cycle continues. Usually I can't make it through the night anymore without coffee, which I have been addicted to since I was young. So I fall asleep until my alarm rings again.

my teachers keep asking me why I don't come to class so much, and I blame it on my asthma, but in reality somedays I just can't bring myself to do it. I've found success in other things, like the gym. Recently I was able to build visible ab muscles, which I am pretty proud of. I try to be kind to every single person I come across. I look pretty average, but it's impossible to date someone when you can't speak their language. 

I can feel the stares on the nape of my neck. A 16 year old, in 8th grade, surrounded by 13-14 year olds. I know it's not the end of the world, I know. I know my life is good, and much better than others. I just wish that I could be in a country where I know the language already, and just settle in a city, and not move. Like Canada, or Australia. Maybe even Brazil. Not the US, for obvious reasons. But a 16 year old, who doesn't get good grades, moving across the world to live by himself to go to a normal school where I can confidently raise my hand and answer the question without having to ask myself if I'm going to embarrass myself by fucking up the grammar, seems impossible. People might tell me to just make it to 18, but I don't know if I can anymore. I just turned 16 last month, and two more years of this seems like hell itself. 

I refuse to be tired. I have to keep going, no matter what. I must be strong, and I must keep going. I don't have anyone to talk to. Both of my parents kind of just leave me be. It took me a few days for my parent to notice I got a haircut. Sometimes I have fantasies of living in Britain or any other country that speaks English where I can just focus on normal teen stuff like dating and getting good grades, or what mom is making for dinner. I have to make my own food. No one forces me to do chores, and my parent is, to be quite frank, more of a roommate. I love them with all my heart, but sometimes it's hard not to resent them slightly for the life they put me through. I just want to be tired from soccer practice, or tired from studying with my friends, or tired from highschool drama.

But I know that's impossible, so I'll keep going. I'm not going to pity myself, or be sad about the life I don't have. I don't know what I'll do, but I'll keep going. I have to keep going.",1,1738640871.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1ih8si4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ih8si4/aio_for_suggesting_a_new_time_for_a_mental_health/,AIO for suggesting a new time for a mental health class in my community?,"I recently showed interest in enrolling in a local mental health course that is being offered for free by a local branch of a well-known national mental health advocacy organization. The course is being overseen by two newly certified women. During a recent coffee meeting with them, they mentioned that I was entering at the foundational stage and even offered to provide training if I was interested in assisting them in establishing a local support group for individuals with mental health challenges. Mental health holds significant importance for me.

The initial class they proposed was scheduled for late evenings, running from 5:30 to 8. I suggested the possibility of having it earlier in the day as it would align better with  
my schedule and that of others I had consulted. They required a minimum of eight  
participants for the class, and I had confirmed five, including myself, but  
only for the earlier time slot. Interest in the later time slot was notably low.

Ultimately, I informed the leader of the affiliate that I would have to decline participation in the class unless it could be rescheduled for an earlier time. This decision was not  
intended to pressure them but simply to communicate my existing commitments  
during that time. The leader expressed regret upon hearing this and understood  
my position. However, the following morning (today), she informed me that they  
could arrange for an earlier time pending discussions with the hosting venue,  
as referenced in our messages.

After some consideration, I chose to withdraw from attending the course due to comments made about me being perceived as ""controlling"" and ""intimidating."" AIO?

1ih8rq7,https://i.redd.it/rp8peu3nn1he1.jpeg,[Mentalist Rewatch] 6x20 Il Tavolo Bianco,"This anniversary rewatch will run daily until February 18, the 10-year anniversary of the Mentalist's series finale.


**SPOILER WARNING: Since this is a rewatch, it's assumed that anyone in these discussions has already seen the entire show, so all spoilers are allowed.**


Day 134 brings us to ""Il Tavolo Bianco,"" which continues with the human trafficking case. Jane brings Lisbon coffee, then spots her helping Marcus find a place in DC. He tells her he hopes she stays because she'll be bored in DC. Lisbon seems to be fishing for him to say more, sounding skeptical that that's Jane's reasoning for her staying. (I swear, these two knuckleheads...) US Marshals arrive and arrest Jane, then serve Lisbon and Kim subpoenas for a grand jury testimony about Jane's murder of Thomas McAllister.

Title relevance: ""Il tavolo bianco"" means ""the white table,"" which is the name of Aurelio's restaurant.

Notable guest stars: Tony Amendola (from Stargate SG-1), Merle Dandridge (from Station 19), Brianne Davis (from Six, and she was Detective Dancer in Lucifer), Jonathan LaPaglia (from Cold Case)

Location: Austin and Dallas 


Notable scenes: 
- Kim and Lisbon are questioned before the grand jury about Jane's murder of Thomas McAllister. Lisbon pleads the fifth and tells the prosecutor to go to hell.
- Cho and Abbott continue their investigation of the trafficking waystation while the others are tied up.
- Back from Dallas, Kim and Lisbon tell Abbott that the prosecutor Lydia Faulk straight-up asked them if Jane killed McAllister. They walk into Abbott's office and find Jane sitting in there on ""bail."" Lisbon figures out right away it was a con (sting). Abbott tells them that it was a necessary part of Operation Juryscam, and that they're targeting a man named John Arcado, who they think paid off members of the grand jury to dismiss his case in the murder of Elijah Macy, a programmer. Jane will examine the jury during his testimony in his own ""case.""
- At the waystation scene, Cho finds Daniela, who is upset her sister is still missing. She points out her sister's tag on the wall, proving she was there.
- Jane doesn't understand why Lisbon is mad at him, and she explains that he should have told her about the grand jury sting, and he argues Abbott ordered him not to. Pike shows up to take her to lunch and, not realizing it's fake, tells Jane he's pulling for him, that he did what any good husband and father would have done. Abbott walks up as they leave and asks Jane how long he's going to let that go. Abbott asks Jane if he knows how he caught conmen in the past, and Jane says they get busted when they start believing their own con, then insists there's no con going on between him and Lisbon.
- In Dallas, during his testimony, Jane begins his examination of the jurors, aggravating the prosecutor by making observations about them. When the prosecutor puts her foot down aggressively, Jane reports back to Abbott that the one doing it is Faulk herself and that now they have to prove Acardo murdered Macy. They look to Acardo's alibi, which is his favorite restaurant, Il Tavolo Bianco. Putting on his Cupid hat, Abbott tells Lisbon to go there with Jane and ""have a nice dinner on the FBI"" which earns him a *look* from Kim and side-eye from Lisbon.
- Cho talks to Daniela again, and Jane notices a heart drawn on her right hand. She tells Cho that they did a blood test on all the girls. Cho finds evidence from a blood-testing kit, which leads them to a medical supply company.
- Jane and Lisbon have dinner at Il Tavolo Bianco. Lisbon apologizes for blowing up at him, though Jane figures out that Marcus convinced her of that, and he says Marcus is wrong and that he really should have told her. Jane asks about mobsters, and Aurelio is forthcoming until Jane asks about Acardo. When deciding what to order, Jane and Lisbon decide to get a very expensive bottle of wine since Abbott is paying.
- Wylie is looking at all the evidence in Macy's case, and Jane asks Wylie to pick out the oddest item, and he picks a thick woolen coat. After examining it, Jane says Wylie just solved the case, telling him to find out if the coat belonged to Macy, but he was allergic to wool.
- Jane says the next step is to get Acardo to put a hit out on Jane. He and Kim head to a nightclub (which is the same nightclub Lucifer's Lux was filmed in!) Jane flirts with Acardo's girlfriend and announces to the entire club that Acardo is a drug dealer and a killer.
- At Pike's apartment, Pike tries to get Lisbon interested in watching Casablanca, despite her reading a magazine instead, insisting she'll love it. He says that the DC question is probably raising questions for her and to let him know when she decides. When he tells her that Casablanca is about a woman who has to choose between two men, he says they could also watch baseball, and she agrees.
- At the medical supply company, Wylie spots a bow and arrow logo on a box of blood testing kits.
- Arcado goes to Il Tavolo Bianco and hands Aurelio a wool coat just like the one found at Macy's scene. Aurelio takes the coat to a drop point, where an assassin waits. Lisbon and Kim tell them to freeze, and Kim is shot in her vest. Lisbon shoots and kills the assassin. (She's deadly lately...)
- Jane arrives at the restaurant wearing the coat, and Acardo is so shocked that he starts choking on his steak, and Jane has to perform the Heimlich maneuver on him before he's taken away.
- Abbott tells Jane that the grand jury indicted him but that the AG is making it go away. He asks how his dinner with Lisbon went. 
- Kim arrests Lydia Faulk. Aurelio is offered a deal and protective custody in exchange for his testimony. He agrees to the testimony, but he refuses the protective custody so that he can keep his restaurant and protect his family.
- Wylie takes something he found to Cho, and Abbott and Cho check it out, finding a facility with evidence of an organ farming operation.
- Jane goes to Lisbon's house with a bag of cannoli from Mrs. Aurelio, but Pike opens the door. He gives it to her and says there's enough for Marcus too, and he tries to leave, but Lisbon tells him he didn't come just to drop off cannoli. He tells her that the most important thing to him is that she does what makes her happy, his voice breaking. He walks off, and Lisbon wipes away tears.

1ih8pd7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ih8pd7,"Beans, grind, or machine?","Have been drinking random pre-ground vacuum sealed espresso coffee bricks from the grocery store. Tasting whatever there was.

I was given a bag of Colombian juan Valdez pre-ground espresso and fell in love with the smell, smoothness and taste. 

a few weeks later, yesterday, I have decided to get a conical burr “cuisineart” coffee grinder on Facebook marketplace place and picked up a few types of beans from Trader Joe’s. I want that quality, and that thick rich smell again. Not a chance so far. The machine is a cuisineart grinder set to the finest setting but it doesn’t look as fine as the grocery store grinds. 

I have made 2 espressos but they are pouring watery to me at least early from what I’m used to.  I drink what we call in Spain “leche manchada”. 
60%milk + 40%coffee.

my grocery store pre-ground espresso extractions fill my cup with solid quality pours all the way to 40% of cup. I obviously use the double filter basket. This new fresh machine ground pours watery around 30% fill and smells like it’s burning.

I don’t taste burn, but it’s definitely watery. My first pour I wondered if I had not packed enough because it became water pretty early on. So the second pour I packed it even harder and I saw improvement but I’m wondering if my grind is maybe too thick and won’t make a difference due to an inadequate grinder. 

From what I understand here are the variables.

Beans
Grinder
Water quality 
Machine pressure / temperature

But I believe…
Beans are freshly opened and ground.
NYC water is always good
Machine works fine with pre-ground so can’t be machine. OR am I wrong?

Finally, already frustrated, I grabbed my phone to check the time… and dropped it face-down on the floor. Screen cracked.

So yeah, I thought I was being efficient. Instead, I just lost time, ruined my morning, and had to buy a new toothbrush and a screen protector. Lesson learned: multitasking before coffee is a dangerous game.

Unfortunately, both tables have failed in the exact same way—the painted surface has started peeling off. When I contacted customer support, my claim was rejected, with the company stating:

""Unfortunately, damages occurring to the tops are not something which can be claimed under the manufacturing warranty, as they are not a manufacturing defect, and as such we would be unable to assist in this instance.""

To make matters worse:

Missing Hardware – The tables and one of the beds arrived without the required assembly hardware. It took months for them to send it, and in the meantime, I had to go to Bunnings and buy bolts just to put them together.  
Damaged Bedside Table – One bedside table arrived with a broken leg, which they only replaced six months later.  
Premium Delivery Scam – I paid for premium delivery, which included removal of all packaging. However, the driver refused to take the packaging, even though it was clearly stated on the invoice. After 30 minutes of arguing, he reluctantly took it.

“Queso?” he repeated, as if the word itself was foreign to him.

“Yeah,” I nodded. “Cheese. Not soup.”

The silence that followed was deafening. His entire worldview had just shifted.

For a moment, I considered backtracking. Maybe I should have just let him believe it was soup. Let him march into Chipotle, head held high, and proudly hand over his golden ticket. Would the cashier hesitate before correcting him? Or would they just let it happen, loading up a bowl with melted cheese while Chris sat there, spoon in hand, expecting a hearty, broth-based meal? The mental image alone was enough to make me regret saying anything.

Chris, however, recovered quickly. “Well,” he said, folding the coupon neatly and slipping it back into his wallet. “Cheese soup still counts.”

And with that, he walked away, entirely unfazed.",1,1738638512.0,stories,0,1.0,False

- top/flat sheets- asked about this and they said they double sheet the bottom (okay..?) and use duvet covers that they wash between guests. (Same thing at the last air bnb- this is so strange to me, but must be a new trend?)

- no extra bedding- for the beds and no bedding for the couch bed in living room or air beds. Just throw blankets on the couch and chairs (which not sure if washed between guests) and hubs is sleeping on the couch because the bed is squeaky and uncomfortable. 

- outdoor couches still have plastic from when they were delivered but it’s so dusty and crusty that we can’t sit on the patio (not that we’d want to because there’s a unit back there that wasn’t disclosed that has windows overlooking back patio. 

- kitchen is missing:
- oven mitts - but there’s an oven
- can opener
- clean/new dish sponge (used one)
- coffee filters for the large can of coffee
- trash bags- there were 3 and we’re staying a month. I asked for more but the request was ignored. The trash can is also huge and takes the huge lawn bags and doesn’t have the lid it was meant to have, so all food trash is left wafting around.

1ih7x5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ih7x5g/breville_barista_express_vs_highend_machine/,Breville barista express vs high-end machine.,"Hi guys,

I’m currently using a Breville Barista Express, but I’m considering upgrading to a higher-end machine and grinder (Lelit Mara X + Eureka Mignon Zero) since I found a used one locally. However, I’m curious—what’s the biggest difference between these two setups?

I usually drink two cups of coffee a day, mostly Americanos. I enjoy lattes too, but I don’t think the Breville does a great job steaming milk. That said, I’m not particularly sensitive to coffee flavors yet and don’t have any major complaints about the taste from my Breville. Before getting my machine, I mostly drank coffee from Starbucks, and back then, it tasted fine to me. But now, when I drink Starbucks coffee (especially iced Americanos), it tastes way too bitter.

To be honest, I don’t really know what makes a café ""good"" in terms of coffee quality, and I don’t think I’ve fully developed my coffee palate yet. Before discovering this subreddit, I was using Lavazza Super Crema beans and didn’t think much about dose, tamp pressure, or extraction time. But now, I’ve started buying freshly roasted beans (within a month of roasting) from a local roaster and carefully measuring my shots—18g in, 36g out. This has made the process much more interesting for me.

So now, I’m wondering—how much of a difference does a high-end machine and grinder make compared to the Breville? Does it significantly improve the taste of espresso? I understand that milk steaming would be a lot better, but in terms of espresso flavor, is it really a noticeable upgrade?

I'm also curious—do you guys go to local cafés like Starbucks or other local chains? How does the coffee taste? Do you like it, or do you think it's a waste of money?

I'm asking because it doesn't seem like they brew espresso the way I’ve seen it done properly(the way like I saw here). I assume it's because most of the baristas are part-time workers, and they likely use expensive automatic espresso machines.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

But things have been getting in the way, but all the talking goes good, and sometimes she initiates them. If I don't hear from her a while, I ask her sometimes ""are you still interested, no pressure to respond"" type things and she always says ""Yes!""

She mentioned early on she suffered severe chronic migraines, but she so happened to have one the morning we were going to meet...Hmm. Hadn't heard back since I said we could reschedule.

Usually I move on, but we had an incredible amount in common, and we both shared a lot about ourselves. I had a particularly good feeling. All the times I thought she was ghosting, she wasn't and responded enthusiastically when I followed up with something noncommittal of a response from her.

Safe to say I'm very confused. Since having numerous flings and a whole relationship ruined by reddit advice, I tend to just use it as a gauge to try to do what feels good. I was planning to reach out to her one more time for an earnest chat about where this is going. Never in my life have I waited a month on someone, but this feels unique. Maybe ""Hey hope you're feeling better. I'm around if you want to call, I'm honestly thinking about where things are going, and wanted to communicate a bit on that.""

My husband of 12 years has transformed from a reasonable conservative into what I can only describe as a Trump cult member, and it's destroying our marriage.

Our house has become a literal shrine to Trump. I wish I was exaggerating. There's a 6-foot Trump cardboard cutout in our living room that he talks to every morning like some sort of religious ritual. Our walls, once decorated with family photos, are now plastered with Trump flags. He even replaced our American flag with a ""Trump 2024 or Death"" banner. My kids are embarrassed to have friends over.

Last week was the final straw. He spent $3,000 of our savings on ""limited edition"" Trump gold-plated coins and a ""certified authentic"" piece of Mar-a-Lago toilet paper. THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. When I confronted him about taking money from our children's college fund, he said ""Trump University will be reopened and make education great again."" I couldn't make this shit up if I tried.

Every dinner conversation somehow turns into a Trump sermon. He'll randomly shout ""STOP THE STEAL"" during family meals. When our 15-year-old daughter got an A+ on her history project about the Civil War, he accused her teacher of being a ""communist infiltrator"" for not teaching ""the truth about Trump's victory.""

Our bedroom... God, I'm mortified to even type this. He insists on keeping a giant Trump portrait above our bed because ""Trump watches over us."" He even got a Trump tattoo on his chest and keeps trying to convince me to get one too. He calls it his ""Mark of Patriotism.""

His entire personality has been consumed. He changed his wardrobe to only red clothing. He refers to himself as a ""Digital Soldier"" and spends hours posting on Truth Social. When I asked him to help with our son's homework, he said he was too busy ""fighting the deep state online.""

The paranoia is getting worse. He installed cameras around our house to ""watch for Antifa."" He thinks our neighbors are ""deep state agents"" because they have a pride flag. He threw out our coffee maker because ""Starbucks is funding the radical left."" He even accused our golden retriever of being ""suspiciously woke"" because she didn't bark at a Biden commercial.

Our sex life? He insists on playing Trump rally speeches in the background and keeps trying to get me to wear a Melania mask. I wish I was joking. He has different MAGA hats for different occasions - including one specifically for ""bedroom patriot time."" I'm dying inside.

I found receipts showing he's donated over $15,000 to various Trump-related causes this year alone. Money we needed for our mortgage. When I showed him our overdue bills, he said ""Trump will fix the economy and make us rich."" We're facing foreclosure, but he keeps buying Trump merchandise.

Yesterday, he announced he's legally changing his name to ""Donald J. Trump Smith"" and wants our kids to follow suit. Our 10-year-old son started crying, and my husband told him ""real patriots don't cry"" and made him watch four hours of rally footage as ""testosterone training.""

I've tried everything - marriage counseling (he called the therapist a socialist), family interventions (he disowned his own mother for suggesting he get help), even pleading with his Trump-supporting friends to tell him he's going too far. Nothing works. He just goes deeper into the rabbit hole.

The worst part? Under all this Trump worship, I know my real husband is still in there somewhere. Sometimes, late at night, I catch glimpses of the man I married. But then morning comes, he puts on his MAGA hat, salutes the Trump cutout, and the cycle begins again.

They have the body of a Sphinx cat but have multiple eyes like a spider, no venomous teeth but instead venomous claws instead. Mourning cats are 4 1/2 feet tall with a length of 3 feet and 12.10 inches long. Their omnivores. They can be domesticated with ease due to their motherly/fatherly like natures and can be considered great house sitters and are living waste bins since they can eat rotting meat + certain materials(like gravestone rock and concrete) since they are scavengers and usually eat already dead animals and sometimes even living animals like rodents and reptiles. They come in the usual colors a cat does.

Happy hounds are domesticated large yet sadly eyeless monster dogs, though despite their large 6 feet tall height and 5 feet 4.15 inch long body they aren’t very aggressive. They are actually very good guard dogs and family pets, since Happy Hounds are omnivores and just like bats usually eat fruits, which means their large fangs are just to suck the nutrients out of fruits. Happy hounds, just like a Samoyed, don’t mind being hugged or laid on from time to time, especially with their massive size! They’re practically like giant walking mattresses or pillows in a sense. But Happy hounds, just like a bat, have very sensitive hearing, especially since they have two large pairs of ears. So usually when they’re given off to family’s, they’re given specialized earmuffs to block off any yelling or loud sounds such as fireworks - the earmuffs have a lifetime warranty depending on the brand. They come in the same colors dogs do, though there’s more variety of colors for Happy Hounds than the average dog - the Happy Hound in the picture has a ‘Morning Coffee’ coat color.",11,1738637279.0,OriginalCharacter,4,1.0,False

1ih7i8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1ih7i8r/some_thoughts_lessons_and_costings_from_our/,"Some thoughts, lessons and costings from our recent Disney World trip (non-American perspective)","We are from New Zealand and visited WDW for the second time in January 2025. Our first trip was two years ago when we were living in the Netherlands. The experiences were quite different and here are some personal thoughts and takeaways that might benefit others, especially if you are from New Zealand/Australia and Europe.

 

Background:

Family of four with 12 and 9 year old boys. We visited Orlando from 15 – 29 January 2025. Jet lag absolutely smashed us on our first trip two years ago, so this time we arranged to visit Universal Studios first (with pool break days) to acclimatise and get over jetlag, before going onto the main event at Disney World.

 

We organised 8 park days at Disney World with a split stay between Caribbean Beach Resort and Port Orleans Riverside, earmarking two days per park. Again, we learnt from the previous trip that it’s a good idea to not push the boys too hard and plan for pool breaks each day (i.e. morning visit, back to resort to rest, then late afternoon visit). On that first visit, the crowd levels were crazy so we were adamant about getting Lightening Lanes this time. We bought Lightening Lane Multi Pass for one day each at Hollywood Studios, EPCOT and Magic Kingdom. We also bought single Lightening Lanes for Tron and Seven Dwarves (MK), Flight of Passage (AK), Rise of Resistance (HS) and Cosmic Rewind (EPCOT).

 

We planned our Disney visit for 22 – 29 January because we wanted to avoid American public and school holidays. It also coincided with our own summer holiday / school vacation in New Zealand (the southern hemisphere).

 

 

Thoughts & lessons – Negative:

 

1. We had been following the weather forecast and were prepared for the temperature to be cold at around 9-10 Celsius (48 – 50F), but when we got to Orlando it ended up being 3-4 Celsius (37 – 39F) and wet for half the trip. Should have brought more layers!! The cold weather really put a dampener on our trip.

2. Main pools at both resorts were closed during the very cold days which was a shame. We went for a resort hop and noticed that a lot of the main pools were closed due for maintenance because it was winter (lesson learnt!)

3. While we weren’t there during American holidays, the parks were still very crowded. We noticed a lot of tour groups from Brazil and Mexico. They added to the atmosphere but geeze, as soon as a big group entered a line, standby waiting times shot up by 30 minutes.

4. It sucks to be in a Standby line and seeing Lightening Lane visitors zoom past you.

5. The boat that goes between Port Orleans Riverside to Disney Spring isn’t very reliable or timely. We waited 50 minutes for our ride.
 

Thoughts & lessons – Positive:

1. We brought disposable rain ponchos with us which were supposed to be for Tiana’s, but they came in very handy for the rain. So much cheaper than if we had bought them at the parks.

2. We had a few Mickey Waffle breakfasts but also Uber-ed to the local Target to stock up on breakfast bagels, fruits and snacks. The food court / main dining halls at both the Caribbean Beach Resort and Port Orleans Riverside had toasters, coffee machines and other amenities that were opened 24/7

3. Whilst we were still staying at Universal, we went for a resort hop along the Monorail route and had a great time eating and snacking our way through the Grand Floridian, Contemporary and Polynesian Resort. It was great fun and totally put us in the mood.

4. Some food at the parks were expensive but some also seemed quite reasonable. Overpriced hotdogs and churros are to be avoided but there were reasonably priced and great quality Mexican (La Cantina de San Angel!) and BBQ meals (Regal Eagle!).

5. Caribbean Beach Resort had incredible customer service, even for Disney. Compared to Port Orleans Riverside and our previous stays at Animal Kingdom Lodge and Pop Century, Caribbean Beach was by far the best.

6. The Skyliner was great for going to EPCOT and Hollywood Studios.
 

Lightening Lane Multi Pass:

1. This was a bit of a hit and miss for us. We liked it more than the old Genie + system because we could pre-book ride timeslots 7 days out from the start of our Disney stay, compared to the 7am on the morning of your park visit, which was stressful. However, we were only able to secure one Tier 1 ride timeslot for each day. By the time we had used the first of our three pre-bookings, which allowed you to rebook another ride, all the other Tier 1 ride timeslots were gone. I.e. The Multi Pass really only allows you to fast track one Tier 1 ride for that day. You will most definitely have to go through the standby queue for the remaining Tier 1s.

2. The benefit of the Multi Pass is debatable for Tier 2 rides and depends on the park. For example, it came in handy for Magic Kingdom with Pirates (10 mins vs 30 min Standby), Small World (5 mins vs 25 min Standby) and Haunted Mansion (15 minutes vs 45 min Standby) but didn’t shorten the already short lines at Under the Sea – Journey of the Little Mermaid, Monsters Inc Laugh Floor and Philhar Magic. In fact, most shows were under capacity and you just had to wait for the next show to start.

3. The Multi Pass felt well worth it for Magic Kingdom and Hollywood Studios. We aren’t sure whether we got our money’s worth for EPCOT, especially given that Test Track and Three Caballeros were out for maintenance and Space Ship Earth was temporarily closed the whole day.
 

Surprise hits & random thoughts:

1. Voices of Liberty at the American Adventure (EPCOT) was very impressive

2. Tiana (MK) was better than Frozen (EPCOT). Personally, way better than the original Splash Mountain.

3. Under the Sea – Journey of the Little Mermaid was surprisingly good. The animatronics were top notch.

4. Monsters Inc Laugh Floor was genuinely funny and very clever, with tons of audience interaction. Don’t go if you don’t want to be picked on.

5. The World Showcase at EPCOT was beautiful to explore during the day and even better at night. We are fairly well travelled and have visited almost all the World Showcase countries but it was still an amazing experience.

6. We had dinner at Roundup Rodeo at Hollywood Studios. Quite pricey but it was all-you-can-eat for entrée, main and dessert. Quality was great and the novelty of being Andy’s toys was worth the visit.

7. Get the refillable mugs at the resorts.

8. We stayed in the Royal Princess Room at Riverside. Cheesy but so awesome and well-themed if you are into Disney.

9. We love Animal Kingdom. It often gets forgotten but we think it is the most beautifully landscaped park. Seeing Pandora at night is a must.
 

Costings in USD – I have stripped out Universal’s portion of the holiday:

1. Return flights for four from our town in New Zealand to Orlando = $4,292

2. Four nights each at Caribbean Beach and Port Orleans Riverside + 8 day park tickets = $5,979

3. Light Lane Singles & Multi Passes = $751

4. Resort/park meals, snacks, drinks + Supermarket bagels & snacks = $1,512

5. Uber for supermarket trip, resort hopping, to and from airport = $139

6. Laundry = $18
 

Total Disney Cost in USD = $12,691

Those are our personal experiences. Super keen to hear yours. While we had fun, the weather, long lines and costs were a bit of a downer and we probably won't go back for a while. Maybe it's rose-tinted glasses speaking but it felt like our first trip back in December 2022 was better, even though it was more crowded.

EDIT: I forgot to add how friendly Americans are. We love your ability to so effortlessly engage in small talk with complete strangers. We had some fun chats with families from Minnesota, New York and Ohio. Those little encounters made our trip better.

Also, tipping still feels like a dark art to us non-tippers from outside the US. I kept having to Google what the appropriate rates were for housekeepers, bellhops, waiters and Uber drivers. 

Also, what's with not including taxes in the price until the total bill is tallied up? That was doing my head in 😂",4,1738636826.0,WaltDisneyWorld,11,0.75,False

I have hypothyroidism (hoshimotos) and weight about 188 lbs right now at 5’3 height. Right now I work two jobs where I am constantly on my feet (teacher and server). I drink probably 2-4 nights a week on my off time and they usually consist of 4 tall boy IPAs (juice force voodoo ranger). Me and my partner have started hello fresh and plan to limit the amount we eat out. Here’s my weight loss plan, I’m just looking for any advice!

• change IPAs to vodka with pickle juice. One shot, immediately drink water so I can maintain a buzz on my nights off without consuming 300 calories during 
• start going on jogs or walks because my exercise is essentially non existent besides being on my feet at work. 
•looking into at home workout machines like pilate machines and stairstepper machines
• fasting: eating after 12 pm (only having water and black coffee before hand) and stop eating at 8 pm. 
• only drinking about once a week, and limiting calories intake that day (not only to avoid over indulging calorie wise but also to maybe help my heavy alcohol tolerance. 

If anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated! Honestly, I am a high stress person and the one thing I am not wanting to do is cutting alcohol out entirely. With it being my only vice, and it’s the center of so much of my social life, I’m not looking to stop this. Thank you!! 

Edit: I honestly am not looking to lose a lot of weight. For the most part, I don’t think I’m on the obese side. I am mainly looking to reduce my stomach fat and bloating and help thin out just slightly ",1,1738636293.0,loseit,5,1.0,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ih78ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddytrailblazer/comments/1ih78ze/wrote_up_how_each_hsr_girl_smells/,Wrote up how each HSR girl smells,"**March 7th:** Most of the time its very, very floral perfume. The kind that the most girly girl would like. However,  she has a very noticeable sweaty musk when she's in Hunt form. She trains alot and doesn't always have the time to take a shower and she doesn't spray perfume at times like that. Because of her dedication, she also doesn't wash her Xianzhou outfit as much as she should and it defintely has a sweaty smell, especially around the pits. What she tries to hide is that she's naturally a very sweaty person, despit her ice affinty and the pit stains while in Hunt form are very noticeable and the lack of washing has caused the smell to build up. So you either get the sweetest, most flowery smelling girly girl or a very musky sweat.

**Himeko:** Mainly coffee but also the faint smell of the scented candles she has around her room. For as much of a coffee lover as she is, she also loves the ambiance that the candles bring so they're almost always lit, so the smell has kinda drifted off onto her. Pleasant but at the same time, because of the coffee, there is a chance of teh bad coffee breath.

**Doll Herta**: Mix of oil, rubber, and slightly rotten wood. Mainly rubber since her ""skin"" is made out of a rubber like substance but  you can also smell the cheap wood that the puppets are made out of (Rubber skin over wooden frame) - cheap because she mass produced so many puppets and she's not the best with money (Leaves that to Asata). When she's damaged or working really hard, you can smell the oil.

**Asta:** Honestly depends on what she's doing. She obviously wants to smell good and you would expect a rich person like her to splurge on the nicest smelling perfumes and soaps but since she doesn't try to flaunt her wealth, she gets what she thinks is normal-nice soap and just forgoes perfume of any kind. Because of that and the fact that she is usually busy running the Herta Station, she often gets pretty sweaty and you can run into her having a bit of BO from time to time, especially since she uses cheap deodorant that doesn't last, which, combinded with the fact that her uniform is sleeveless, is a recipe to get a whiff. She tries to smell good and, to her credit, she does freshen up a bit more when she goes on vacation with Topaz but she can easily go the other way. Can be pretty and girly smelling but just as often can be a bit sweaty and smelly.

**Kafka:** Bath bombs before she starts work - she spends alot of time bathing, as evident by the Fermata LC. However, she can smell a bit gunpowdery after ""work"". Smells nice and pleasant, which you wouldn't expect, considering her company being a dead guy and two other people that will be expanded upon later. Smells of fresh roses.

**Silver Wolf:** Gamer gremlin girl has the stereotypical gamer smell: Sweat and very bad BO. Very musky but doesn't care at all - cares so little, in fact, that the only reason she's even allowed to wear shorts is because Kafka forces her to shave her legs (otherwise her game accounts would be taken if she went out with hairy legs). Doesn't bathe often (Mainly when Kafka puts her foot down and forces her to) and just gets her clothes from a pile on the floor so they aren't often washed - often not a big deal for her because she almost never goes outside and mainly just uses her hologram. Doesn't own a single stick of deodorant - sweaty pit stains are common on her.

1ih73cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1ih73cy/dear_brian_niccols/,Dear Brian Niccols:,"I believe there may be a ""lost in translation moment"" in the interpretation of customer feedback.

I have heard many customers and baristas echo the statement, pretty overwhelmingly in fact: ""I miss the days when Starbucks wrote on cups.""

Getting back to Starbucks definitely does involve those cup writing days. But it wasn't the writing on cups specifically, it was the era and the atmosphere of those times.

During that time, we didn't have sticker printers for the drinks. We didn't have mobile orders, deliveries, or even drive thrus.

""I miss the days that Starbucks wrote on cups"" refers to the feeling of visiting a coffee shop, ordering at a register, and having a conversation with a human being.

The sticker printers ushered in a new era of impersonal interaction. Cup writing became obsolete. Stickers printed out and it might be the customer that just ordered at register, or it might be a person 5 miles away on their app. 

Seeing printers spit out stickers, the barista rushing to package delivery orders, place mobiles on a handoff plane so th no customer having yet arrived, all while waiting for the drink you ordered at the register is the interruption that hinders that ""Starbucks feeling"" that we all want to get back to.

Writing a message on every cup, is not a supplement for the impersonal transaction that the sticker machines, mobile ordering, drive-thru speed, and deliveries create. 

So while I understand that ""writing on every cup"" may feel like it adds a personal touch, the cup writing that is currently mandated does not reflect what customers and baristas were actually asking for.

""I miss the days that Starbucks wrote on cups"" does not translate to ""I wish my cup were written on.""

It translates to:

""I miss the days when I was treated like a human being, Starbucks had no stocker machines, and my humanity was not reduced to a slip of paper that is spit out from a machine.""

Please do bring us ""back to Starbucks.""

The most effective way to do so, woukd ne to eliminate mobile ordering, deliveries, and the sticker printers altogether.

This may not seem like it's feasible since they are so integrated. 

But mobiles and eliviroes are the number one interruption to our ability to provide good service. They have been since day one of their implementation.

The fact that baristas have been repeating this pretty much unanimously for years, and recently you are quoted as saying that the mobile ordering system needs to be revisited for this reason, is a punctuation mark on how the corporate culture does not listen to the voice of store level employees. 

As a 20 year employee who lives the opportunity to create genuine joy through my work, I invite you to sit with me for a coffee tasting. I'd love to connect over coffee, and chat about the good ol days that we can Gen get back to in a positive and constructive way. I do believe that the location of my home store woukd not be too inconvenient for you to visit, and I'd welcome the opportunity to be a part of getting back to Starbucks in a meaningful way.

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this whole thing.

1ih72lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ih72lg/rewrite_for_all_those_we_cannot_save/,(Rewrite) For all those we cannot save,"A knock on my cabin door interrupts my solitude.


Separating myself from my coffee, I grab my uniform jacket and head towards the door, calling out, “Who is it?”


“Ensign Smith, sir. We received a signal.”
Opening the door, I continue ahead of the enlisted crewman. “What do you have for me?”


“Not much, sir,” came the voice from behind. “We received it a couple of minutes ago, and I immediately left the bridge to get you.”


Arriving on the bridge, I take in a quick scan of my crew working diligently. “Signals, what have you got for me?”


“Audio and visual transmission, sir. About 45 seconds long before it cuts out.”


“Put it on screen,” I command as I take my place in the center of the deck.


Sounds of blaster fire fill the deck, static giving way to an alien face shouting to be heard over the sounds of a battle raging on around them. An explosion nearby causes the figure to flinch and move the camera, allowing me to catch a glimpse of a soldier of our enemy entering a doorway. A few more moments of shouting before the transmission is cut. 

In the deafening silence of the deck, I am transported back by the voice of my senior signals crewman. “That's everything we have, sir.”


Immediately, I begin formulating plans and possible outcomes. “Do we have a lock on the location yet?”


“Not yet, sir. We should in a couple of minutes.”


“As soon as you do, send a probe. I want everything we can get on that planet.” 

Turning to the other side of the command deck, “Linguistics, anything?”


“Not much, sir. It's not long enough for us to build anything solid. There are some similarities in pattern to a few other races, but that could just be coincidence.”


“We have a lock, and the probe is en route, sir. ETA is 13 hours,” came a voice from my signals crew.


Spinning on my heels, I turn my attention back to signals. “Good. As soon as we begin getting data, I want it sent to my terminal and notified.”


I then retire to quarters. I hate the delay of space. Fidgeting in front of my crew is a bad look, so I always await news in my personal living area. I am pacing when a rapid knock on my cabin door derails my train of thought.


Another ensign, out of breath, “We're receiving data, sir.”


I don't wait for the ensign as I swiftly make my way to the command deck. As I enter through the door, I immediately look to my crew and approach my terminal. “Intel, what do you have for me?”


“Enemy presence confirmed. Standard array of 3 Juggernauts, 5 Battle-cruisers, 2 Carriers, and planet-stripping layout. Standard large garden planet, sentient native race, just coming into their industrial time frame by the looks of some of the untouched places yet. Must have stumbled upon them. Interestingly, the planet was on our radar to be checked out for the possibility of life, but wasn't on the docket for another few months.”


“Good work.” I nod and turn my attention homeward. “Communications, open up a channel to the council for me.”


A few minutes later, I am face to face with the council representative of all listening outposts. “Ma’am, this is Colonel Loprey of Paynal Station. We have received a transmission requiring immediate attention. Enemy presence confirmed already on planet. I am sending you everything I have.”


“Understood, Colonel. I will take this to the council immediately. Thank you.”


After a few hours attempting to sleep, I give up fighting my racing mind and drag my exhausted body from my bed. After showering and putting on a fresh uniform, I decide to head to the bridge. Leaving my doorway, I see a young ensign shuffling down the hall with the look of a dog with its tail tucked between its legs.


Realizing the new presence in the hallway, the ensign stops and stammers, “I… I'm sorry, sir. The council has denied your request for action.”


Rushing to my terminal on the command deck, I open up a message from the councilwoman.

*“I'm sorry, commander. We can't save everyone.”


I look up, scanning my crew around the deck, looking for something, anything, an idea on how to proceed. A mix of solemn faces and those looking to distract themselves with continued focus on their work. I had heard rumors, transmissions getting to listening outposts too late, ships can't make it in time. Arriving to the smoldering ruins of planets or just as the last enemy ships leave the area. It happens, but I had hoped it wouldn't happen to me, my crew.


Just then, a large banner flashed up on the main screen. A still image from the transmission we received, “If you receive this transmission, do not respond. The council has been notified. No action is to be taken.”


I stand up from leaning over my terminal. Squaring my shoulders, I clear my throat. “Alright, everyone. That's it. The council has made their decision. Archive the data. Unfortunately, we can't save them all. Shift leads, if anyone feels they'd like some extra time off to process this, they have my blessing.”


With that, I turn and proceed to my quarters with a very controlled and measured pace. Upon return, I collapse into my lounge chair and pick up my personal data pad.

> Willum…. *SECURE*
*Loprey: Willum. I've got something for you. Your eyes only.
*Willum: Is it that you want to come back and babysit us again?
*Loprey: I'd love to, but you know they put me out to pasture after your stunt at Milliways. I'm sending you the data I have. 


---------------------------------------------------


A knock from an exterior door.
Odd. We all looked around and counted ourselves. Sure enough, all twenty-three of us were present. It was a mixed air of emotions because while our supply shipment was over a week late, the noise from the door sounded like none any of us had heard before. Not to mention that as far as we knew, we were the first of our species to make it this far south on our planet. Since the tardiness of our supplies, emotions have gone from annoyed, to upset, to concern and now genuine fear. Slowly rising from our seats and exchanging glances, the youngest of us managed to summon the courage to check the door. With a shriek, he flung the door wide open and stumbled backwards as six large creatures entered in, pointing weapons first at us and then our surroundings. The first one quickly raised his weapon supporting hand  in front of him and spread his digits apart. While he froze and stared at us, the other five spread around and searched our quarters as if searching for something. 


After a few moments, short barks came from the five searching our quarters and then the first one seemed to relax, putting his hand and weapon down and then removing his facial covers. From a pouch on his back he pulled a small pad and drug his finger along making strange markings. He turned the pad to us to reveal the markings and tapped under them twice. ""Willum"" a voice said from within the pad and their leader placed his hand on his chest. He repeated this again and then repeated the word himself. From there uneasy introductions were made. 


Then came the teaching of our language to the speaking pad. It began like teaching a small child but by the end of the day it was like speaking to one of our own. As progress was made, our unease lifted and we shared food with the aliens within our dwelling. It was quite perplexing, while two of them looked similar to Willum, the other two were clearly different species from Willum and each other. We took turns teaching the talking pad and during our break away from it we noticed that Willum and his crew seemed uneasy. Not hostile or impatient, just... uneasy. Like they knew more that they were unsure about sharing.
When we were done, Willum took the pad and wrote in his own language. Then turning the pad towards us, he tapped a square on the screen and his markings were translated to ours and the voice within spoke the words aloud! ""Hello, my name is Willum and this is my crew."" Then, Willum tapped a circle at the bottom of the screen and spoke in his own language and when he was done, he tapped it again. Again, the pad spoke in our language! ""We have come from beyond your star to rescue you.""


Immediately there was an eruption of questions and Willum raised both of his arms to settle the room. He spoke at length and explained the ancient race that had come to ravage our planet, the other races rescued from their planets which his two non-human crew members attested to, and the lack of time we had left. For a while he answered questions, but not all of them. He said we needed to spend the night processing our new fates. He told us to rest and that we'd reconvene in the morning. Rest, because he knew as well as we did that none of us would sleep that night. Except for his crew, which took shifts inside of their ship.


In the morning we gathered our personal belongings and squeezed into their ship. Willum showed us images of our planet from their probe above. Many of us cried as we watched the fires and smoke consuming our planet. We noted that the last populated port where we all gathered before leaving for this leg of our journey, seemed yet untouched. So it was there we landed. With our combined efforts, we convinced the townspeople of what had befallen our planet. Once we had settled everyone down and Willum had answered questions, he informed us that he and his crew would need a bigger ship. They told us to give them two days. Gather everything we could and prepare to leave. If they didn't return after two days, we could either flee to our research post in the south and pray, or go out swinging.


So we did what they asked. They took off on their ship and immediately the town was buzzing. The library and school were emptied of every book. Every single document and historical item gathered. Livestock gathered, fields and seeds prepared. Everything that could be packed, we did. On the evening of the second day, we all gathered in the town hall to discuss what to do next, when suddenly the ground shook beneath us and a low hum filled our ears. Outside in an empty field, a ship a great multitude larger than Willums set down. When the main ramp let down, Willum and his crew emerged with smiles on their faces and told us to load as quickly as we could. They assured us that we were safe temporarily and that the blood splattering their armor was *mostly* not theirs. Something about very lax ground security measures in uncontested space. 


With immense effort and surprising speed, we managed to squeeze everything we wanted onto the freighter. Somehow the humans had even managed to nose their ship in, and we packed our belongings right up alongside it. As soon as the last items were packed, buildings and people triple accounted for, we collapsed. Some did not rest the entire time we loaded the ship and were soon asleep atop crates and random home furnishings. With our anonymous approval, the humans did not miss a beat getting us into the air. We crowded view ports and watched as our burning world shrunk behind us. Many wailed, some sang farewells, one of the towns priests led prayers. 


After a while, when everyone had settled and most had slept, Willum came to us with news. Contact had been made with their grand council and arrangements were being made for us. We were heading to a station for a quarantine and to give them time to decide where we should go. Apparently, as soon as word got out what Willun and his crew had done for us, at least a dozen different races immediately offered to take us in. 


---------------------------------------------------


Sitting atop the human ship in the cargo bay, I saw one of the humans fidgeting with a map of our world on his speaking pad. After a bit, he had spread it out and began writing “723rd G.H.O.S.T’s” above and “.583067000001"" below it. When I asked him what it meant, he explained that 723rd is their unit. The lower number is for this being the 58th planet humans have encountered like this, 3,067 survivors - 000001 For all the ones we couldn’t save.

1ih71wf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ih71wf/for_stonewalling_an_ex_and_coworker/,for stonewalling an ex (and coworker),"I got really close to a coworker. We dated for a bit, but had a fall out. 

I wanted to figure out what had happened because we completely shoved the stuff under the rug. For two months. It hurt so much. She even stonewalled me at work, later apologizing for doing it saying she “didn’t want to lose the chance of keeping me as a long term friend”. So I said, okay then let’s finally talk about it. she said “give me a few days to figure out my car stuff.” she ignored me for a week. 

two months of cat and mouse and one morning i had a realization that she didn’t respect me at all and didn’t deserve my attention or energy. Not even as a friend. so i went to work, and… to be honest without even feeling like i had to “try”, i stonewalled her back. 

She OBVIOUSLY hated it. But I didn’t really care because she didn’t care to ever get back in a timely manner, or breakup with respect. And, had actively punished me with surprise stonewalling. I had put in the work to find closure without ANY communication. She texted promptly that night. A week late response to me asking for a coffee or call to clear the air, mind you: “i’ve been thinking about it and I’d rather have this convo over text”. I ignored it and kept up the stonewall the following day. it doesn’t even feel vengeful as much as it feels liberating for respecting myself. 

I’m just so sick of being discarded. And using my words and walking with forgiveness in my heart while people breadcrumb me. it’s not that i have hatred for her, but that i’m done giving it energy. 

AITA for dropping her like this? 

edit: she had asked me to be her boyfriend later down the line. when i asked her (after the wordless breakup) if we were still texting she said “i can go either way, seeing as we set this up as a casual thing”. i felt pretty gaslit for having been told that boyfriend line was “a casual thing”.",2,1738635467.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False
