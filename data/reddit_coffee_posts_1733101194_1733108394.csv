My birthday is in the first week of January, I usually feel like shit those weeks before and after due to numerous traumatic events. I also live very lonely and secluded life - for reasons. I think it would be cute to receive some abstract but warm messages from you, people of Reddit, since this community feels like good old internet that I loved and that was my home. I¬†**love surprises,**¬†poetry and awkward pieces of knowledge. I also love frogs, animals at work, especially cats (like cats of Istanbul that work all kinds of occupations), pixel art and glitch, old school internet and computers, black&white, advertising (not ad cards per se, but some advertising posters, vintage maybe). And coffee, cutiness, kawaii, comfy-ness. Something related to homelessness and finding a home. I also like kink and queerness. I can read English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian, Belarussian, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, Levantine Arabic (in Arabeze). Thank yous will be posted! Reply here or send me a message or chat and I'll send my address. Thank you so much!

1h4kydg,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1h4kydg/screamed_at_me_for_over_an_hour_over_sugar/,Screamed at me for over an hour over sugar.,"I just wanted to post here because I am feeling down and a little terrible about the situation. For some background since I'm new here, I (23F) live with my grandparents. I grew up in a very unstable home with two horrible parents. My mother I still don't talk to but my father and I's relationship is on the mend right now. I came to live with my grandparents almost 9 years ago now. The situation was getting bad at home and I moved states and in with my grandparents (Grandparents on my mothers side) in order to have a better life then what I thought I was going to have staying with my divorced abusive parents. What I didn't know was basically that I was coming out of the frying pan and into the fire. My grandmother is very hard to explain without making her sound like the worst kind of human. She isn't all bad... but she isn't a great person to be around a lot of the time and my grandfather is more absent and tends to just disappear  during the daylight hours. 

Now to the current situation. I (23 F) was with my boyfriend (29 M) hanging out at his house and playing video games. My grandmother knew where I was and (even though I am 23, I still ask before I go anywhere besides collage and work as is her rules) I had already gotten all my classwork done and didn't work so I was hanging out with him. My boyfriend and I were having a great time and playing our Stardew Valley farm when my grandmother called me mid-game and before I could say hello started screaming through the phone at me. At first I was confused as to what she was so mad about because all she said was that I was stupid and dumb and a horrible person. At this point I am already feeling horrible. I don't know what is going on yet but I know that whatever it is that I did must have been really bad. In a break in the screaming I asked her what is wrong and she then started yelling at me and saying ""Nyx, You do not take my god damn sugar and use it. You do not use my stuff. God damn it."" And then she hung up. I was shocked and I didn't realize I was even crying until my boyfriend hugged me. For some context: I used about 4 tablespoons of sugar for my coffee that morning because the sugar container that I keep filled (bought with my own money) was empty and I hadn't been to the store yet. I honestly didn't think she would notice if I used 4 tablespoons of her sugar.  Not even 10 minutes after she hung up she called me again. My boyfriend told me to ignore the call but if I did then the situation would be so much worst when I got home. I answered the call and she proceeded to say ""How are you so stupid? You are such a lazy waste of space. You eat my food and take my shit and you don't even shampoo my carpet or scrub the bathtub anymore."" She said more things and basically spent the next 15 minutes insulting me and calling me various names. At the end of the call I was sobbing and my boyfriend held me, not knowing what to do. I told him that I should probably go home before I make things worst for myself by staying. 

Once home I went straight into my room until she stormed in and started yelling at me again. For 45 minutes she screamed at me and I can't say anything or do anything, I just have to take it or it gets worst. Once she is done she dismisses me and only then can I go and hide in my spot. (I know that I am an adult but when she is like that it makes me feel better to hide somewhere smaller and dark so that I can calm down and feel safe, right now that place is in my closet behind my clothes). I just feel hurt and I try to do everything she needs but I am walking on eggshells all the time and I am so tired. 

For some more information: I can't just move out. It isn't an option right now because she has her fingers in all my financials as well as my car and several other things. I have been trying to find a way to quietly move out without a huge fallout and her using her strings to bring my life crashing down around me. I am tired though, I feel alone and I can't help but feel like a prisoner in my own home. I know that this isn't healthy but I am not sure what to do or how to do this anymore.

","I was trying to drink more water, so I pivoted from coffee to those caffeinated/vitamin B water enhancers (think Mio). 

I was drinking water bottles full of this stuff every day, probably 4-5 bottles with multiple servings in each one. 

Seemingly out of nowhere, my skin erupted! I had painful, inflamed, even swollen patches all over my skin. It was breaking out EVERYWHERE on my fave with MASSIVE pustules. I even posted here about it at some point asking for help. I would just drink more water (and thus more of the Mio) thinking maybe I was just dehydrated? 

One day, as I sat there exhausted and feeling ‚Äúoff,‚Äù I realized how much I was drinking and googled symptoms of vitamin B overdose. I felt kind of crazy - imagine my shock when I read that I WAS OVERDOSING ON VITAMIN B! 

Not only was my skin breaking out but it was the weirdest texture - like my moisture barrier was broken, and my makeup would just sit on top of my skin. Simultaneously oily and flaky and red. It hurt so, so, so much. I would tweeze little whiskers and they‚Äôd turn into red bleeding pits. It was absolutely terrible. I really can‚Äôt emphasize enough how painful my face was. 

I really had done so many different things to help my skin and was increasingly frustrated. I had a pretty good routine down, so the whole thing was bizarre. 

I quit drinking it and my face healed in like, less than a week. Insane.

I have been on T for 5 months. I have been out to *every single* person I have ever known since I was 13, trans since 12.

 It's not noticeable whatsoever since T has not given me any pronounced/obvious passing effects. Which is quite devastating and as equally exhausting as not being out. I got very burnt out in high school trying to pass only to be met with getting misgendered at a new school. 

I dressed very feminine despite being out, which was unusual after attempting to pass for over 4 years. Now, I'm starting to adapt the same attitude with my new job. I work in the death care industry which is stuck in older morals as many older folk run the business. Even on funeral directing subreddits, I surprisingly got a lot of hate comments. They didn't upset me but it's very backwards to have no retreat in the industry.  

Is it okay to feel like the ""risk"" over the ""reward"" is worth not staying out to my coworkers despite the copious amount of dysphoria? My management team at my old funeral home were good about me telling the but nobody seemed to ""remember"", whether I repeatedly corrected them or not. Previously being a barista at two major coffee chains, that was no issue for anybody. I just fear that when I do pass after being on T 6+ months, I'll be the ugliest girl and my coworkers will be upset I never told them.

Binny‚Äôs Pick

Proof: 116

Nose: Rich vanilla and the warm, buttery crust of a freshly baked cherry pie. Juicy cherry notes take center stage, vibrant and inviting, with a subtle campfire smokiness adding depth. As I continue to drink, fresh coffee ground notes emerge at the end. A fascinating nose that I couldn‚Äôt get enough of.

Palate: Wow. Honey and ripe, syrupy cherries coat the tongue, complemented by the sweetness of cherry hard candy. The flavors are absolutely mouthwatering, with a velvety, pleasantly oily mouthfeel. Drinks smoothly, with warmth and complexity that are well under the proof.

Finish: A long, satisfying finish where sweet cherry lingers beautifully. Mint and oak emerge, balancing the sweetness, with light peppery notes and baking spices providing a crisp, spicy close.

Conclusion: This whiskey blew me away. By far the most interesting bottle in my small collection right now. The cherry notes were exquisite, making each sip a luxurious experience. I can‚Äôt wait to see how it evolves as it opens up further.

I recognized him from across the street. He was sitting at the bar lining the glass front. He looked different from his pictures, not in any meaningful way; I just had a different face in mind. I ordered my food and sat next to him. I had to lean in whenever he talked. He spoke very quietly. I did like his eyes, somewhere between light blue and light green with a big patch of brown on the left eye. Later he would tell me he felt special growing up for having heterochromia. I would have felt special too. 

I didn‚Äôt think he liked me. But he insisted on walking me to my bus stop when I said I should go, and he asked if I wanted to do this again, with that same small frown he always has on his face. I hope he isn‚Äôt taking pity on me. I have to believe he isn‚Äôt.

We go to the arts fair on our second date. We sit on a rancid sofa to watch the video art exhibition. He sits a good two feet away from me. Third date, we go sunbathing. He has his half-tank nude binder on. I keep my shirt on. I tell him I think something might be wrong with me.

Fifth date, he says ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre more invested in me than I am in you.‚Äù Gets on his bike, rides away.

Two years later: how have you been? I‚Äôve been pretty good, you? Pretty good too; wanna get coffee sometime? I‚Äôd like that. Great. :)

I text Emily about it. She warns me that I might just be setting myself up to get hurt. I agree. I put on cologne and leave the house.

We end up getting pizza. He changed his hair; he bleaches it now. It works. He seems to smile more easily. When we part ways, I lean in to hug him. He hugs me back. I‚Äôm swallowing down how much this means‚Äîhis small, bony body, the smell of his cologne, the way his face rests on my shoulder. When I get home I can still smell his cologne on my shirt.

Three months later: I ignore Emily‚Äôs text and cut open the last of my boxes. This is what I‚Äôve brought to be with him. I don‚Äôt need much. Knife, toothbrush, pills, phone charger, camera, journal, pens, a few sets of clothes. He is playing the electric guitar unplugged. His window unit is fighting against the heat. I go to sleep. I wake up with him in my arms.

Two months later: Landlord needs us out. Isabel hasn‚Äôt been spending much time here anyways. Gavin, I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôll do. X and I have friends‚Äînew friends of mine, old friends of his, Mary and Colin, a stripper/law student + a potential rockstar/weed dealer, who are moving into an apartment building across the rivers. New development. Beautiful exposed brick walls. We move in.

One month later: We are right next to the river. The rivers are brown even on a clear day. He gets down on one knee. I thought he was taking me on this walk to break up with me. I say yes.

Three months later: This apartment lets in a lot of light when it‚Äôs empty. We assemble the bed together. God I wish I could talk to him. I go to my friend‚Äôs house. He goes to sleep alone. 

One month later: The center diamond fell out of my ring. I don‚Äôt know how. There are three. The center one fell out. I spend hours searching the debris on the steps of our apartment building. I can‚Äôt find it.

One month later: I tell Emily I love her. She sets her mouth in a hard straight line. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù she says.

One month later: I‚Äôm bored in our room and I pull out a spiral-lined notebook. ‚ÄúDear Emily,‚Äù it says, ‚Äúyou are nine months old‚Ä¶‚Äù

Two months later: X‚Äôs mother leads me slowly down the stairs. ‚ÄúAnd this is my husband‚Äôs ‚Äòman cave,‚Äô‚Äù she says, laughing. She catches the edge of a bookshelf in her fingers and pulls it aside. It opens into a small room lined wall to wall with guns. Carbines. Assault rifles. Snipers with their legs folded in. A shelf of MRE packets in the back. She shuts the shelf. ‚ÄúMen!‚Äù she laughs.

‚ÄúHave you ever shot a gun?‚Äù I ask him. ‚ÄúYeah, the small ones they give to kids at the range. They gave me a little pink one.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fucked.‚Äù

It changes all the time!,"I mean, I understand, that in theory, you have a certain IQ which is relatively stable and doesn't change that quickly. But, what kind of mental performance does this abstract number actually represent? Does it represent your average performance, or your peak performance?

Taking an IQ test will never give you this abstract number that represent either your peak cognitive performance or your average performance - the only information it will tell you is about your performance AT THE TIME OF TESTING.

And it depends on a lot of factors, such as: how well did you sleep last night, did you drink coffee or not, what time of day it is, are you fresh or tired, how well hydrated you are, are you hungry or is your stomach full or too full perhaps, etc...

I think our IQ changes all the time and may oscillate around some number that represents our average performance even up to +/- 15 IQ points.

For example if I got tested 5 times, at random times and in random situations, the average of those  results would likely give me my IQ score that represents my average cognitive performance... For the sake of discussion, let's call this number X.

Now, if I do the test very fresh, hydrated, in the morning, after some light meal and some coffee, I might score close to my peak performance, and it's likely to be somewhere around X+10.

On the other hand if I do the test when tired, in the evening, or after a heavy meal, or if I skipped my coffee, I might score somewhere around X-10.

And if I get actually drunk, and try to do the test then, then I might score X-20 or even lower.

I think we have regular daily oscillations of IQ.

It probably peaks an hour or two after waking up, and then slowly declines as the day progresses, reaching the bottom just before we go to sleep.

She wasn‚Äôt a gamer by any stretch, but her little brother, Max, had begged her to bring him. While he dashed off to battle pixelated aliens, Mia wandered aimlessly, soaking in the flashing lights and beeping sounds.

That‚Äôs when she saw him.

He was leaning over a claw machine, his brows furrowed in concentration. A mop of curly hair framed his face, and his hoodie had a faint coffee stain on the sleeve. The machine‚Äôs claw dangled precariously over a stuffed panda, and he muttered under his breath, willing it to grip.

Mia couldn‚Äôt help but smile. ‚ÄúThat panda‚Äôs not going anywhere,‚Äù she blurted before she could stop herself.

The boy turned, startled, and then grinned sheepishly. ‚ÄúYeah, this thing‚Äôs rigged. But I‚Äôm already five dollars deep, so I‚Äôm committed.‚Äù

Mia chuckled. ‚ÄúNeed help losing more money?‚Äù

He laughed, a warm sound that made her stomach flutter. ‚ÄúWhy not? I‚Äôm Ethan, by the way.‚Äù

She joined him, coaching him on timing the claw‚Äîthough she wasn‚Äôt much better at it. After a few failed attempts, Ethan finally snagged the panda, holding it up triumphantly.

‚ÄúFor your expert guidance,‚Äù he said, handing it to her.

Mia‚Äôs cheeks flushed as she took it. ‚ÄúThanks. But I think you‚Äôre the one who did all the work.‚Äù

They spent the rest of the afternoon talking. Ethan told her about his dreams of becoming a game designer, while Mia shared her love of photography. Time seemed to blur, the arcade fading into the background.

When it was time to leave, Ethan hesitated. ‚ÄúHey, would you maybe want to hang out again sometime?‚Äù

As I discover what I can do to turn this place into my own personal paradise on earth, planting bonsais, fruit trees and vegetables, I decided to setup two compost bins to reduce my carbon print and recycle the kitchen stuff. Which basically turned most of my waste to fertilizer. 

As I was reading up on how to do this, I realized something. 

I had to balance the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in this homemade little universe. 

Carbon came from brown stuff; dead tree leaves, twigs, papers, cardboard etc. 

And nitrogen came from green stuff; cut grass, unwanted parts of spinach, leek, even coffee grounds.

I drilled holes in boxes to provide oxygen.

Then it occurred to me; all of this was once something else. And though we referred to them as dead, as it was the case with tree branches, leaves etc, in the end they were material made possible by physical manifestation after right elements of nature, right vitamins, minerals etc cake together.

And they were now going back to nature to get cycled.

The fact is, even if I didn‚Äôt do this, leaves would still get absorbed by wet soil. 

It‚Äôs just that by doing so I chose where and how their nutrients would get distributed.

Under the great scheme of things, we are no different. 

So death is a transition really, not the end.

What upsets us about death of others is the sentimental value of people or pets for us, and with ourselves, the unknown, what will happen once we are gone.

The thing is, we will never be truly gone. 

It‚Äôs just that we will change forms. 

Now, will you come back as someone else or ‚Äúsomething‚Äù else?

Probably not.

Because there won‚Äôt be a ‚Äúyou‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou‚Äù as an entity is the sum total of what everyone else assigned to you; your name, your nationality, your religion or lack of it.

These doesn‚Äôt mean anything to universe.

What matters is that ‚Äúyou‚Äù are part of a vast energy that spreads for billions of light years, and we don‚Äôt even know if this has an end. If it has, how‚Ä¶

None of us are actually separate lonely entities.

We are all linked somehow. 

And without referring any religion or deity, I do feel that we are the manifestation of something trying to understand itself.

Throw away acct bc my ex knows my UN on Reddit.

Backstory - 
I‚Äôm a 42y old woman with 2 kids (6m, 10f))

My husband of 15y died in 2020 after complications from a 5y battle
with non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. 

We‚Äôd met in high school, our families remain extremely close, and we had what I can only describe as a perfect relationship. He was my best friend and I was his - he set the bar extremely high.

When we knew his cancer was incurable my husband encouraged me to grieve but then move on and find a partner because in his words ‚ÄúI was an amazing partner‚Äù and he wanted our children to witness what love looked like.

I never imagined I‚Äôd date again - however last year, on the encouragement of our families and my therapist; I put myself out there.
I went on about a dozen first and second dates, I had a 5 month long relationship with a very nice man whom I just wasn‚Äôt ready for and it ended amicably.

I have been very upfront about my loss and re/entering the dating world, and met a great guy, whom I‚Äôll call Greg, on Hinge in the late summer of 2023.

Greg is a 43y old single father with a 6y old son. Has a very stable job of 20+ years as a firefighter. Co-parents well 50-50 with his ex wife whom he split from due to her affair in 2021. 

He had 2 previous relationships after his split - one for 6 months with a young woman he knew wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere, and a second with a woman whom he‚Äôd dated out of high school - for approx 3 months who kept him ‚Äúat arms length and wasn‚Äôt affectionate enough‚Äù for him to feel he had a connection with. We met 6 weeks after his last relationship.

It felt very organic from the get go. 

We had coffee for our first date and hit it off from the get go. Tons of laughs. Had our second date for dinner a few days later that went on for 6 hours at a local pub, 3rd the same week and by date 4 he stated he was deleting the apps and wanted to date me exclusively - that he hadn‚Äôt felt connection with anyone since he had met his wife back in his 20‚Äôs.

We spent a lot of time together - he‚Äôs a shift worker and I work half time during the day as a social worker by choice. My late husband was a high income earner and he had a substantial life insurance policy that has allowed my children and I a comfortable future.

Everything seemed great.
I met his son and family around the 2 month mark - and we hit it off. I met his ex wife at the 3 month mark and again, we hit it off. She was very happy that he‚Äôd met someone - I was the first person he‚Äôd introduced to his son - and she and I got along well (at this point she‚Äôs now engaged to her guy too)

Our relationship is great. We have tons of fun together. We had a great winter and spring - travelled as much as we could. Spent the summer at our family cottage with all the kids, our friends and his parents spent a ton of time with my family and my late husbands. He earned everyone‚Äôs approval. 
Zero red flags.

At the 6 month mark, he begins talking to me about marriage - would I ever want to marry again?
Would I ever want to live with someone again?

I was finally in a place where I could say yes. 
He talked at length with my parents about this - his parents too.

In September we started talking about logistics. Would he move into my home which was larger and could accommodate all of us? No. He felt uncomfortable about that - it was a house I shared with my late husband. 
We agreed to keep our respective properties and rent them out as income properties - and buy a home together. We made a list of our dream home. Budget. 

Things started to feel real, and exciting.
We booked an appt with the bank for late Oct to get mortgage approval.
We had a very frank talk about  marriage - and he told me he wanted to get married within a year and hoped I was on the same page. I was.

So we are now at 14m into our relationship.

The morning of our mortgage appt - he called to tell me he had tested positive for Covid - and that we‚Äôd have to reschedule. I reschedule for his next day off which was Nov 13th, a Wednesday.

On the 12th, the evening prior - we had a really nice dinner out - and went over everything that we needed for this appointment. It was a great night and the vibe was really happy and positive.

The next morning - just after getting the kids off to school - he brought me a coffee and said he needed to talk to me. 

I asked him what was up - I‚Äôd never seen him so serious. 
In this moment it was like something completely changed.

Tearfully he told me that he‚Äôd kept from me that he was nearly bankrupt.
When I asked him what he meant - he said that he‚Äôd made some poor choices post divorce with helium mining (still no idea what this is) day trading and sports betting and had incurred nearly 200k in debt since his divorce. That he was insolvent - and was making a proposal for a consumer debt relief.

I was absolutely shocked.
I did not react however and just let him talk. 
He told me he was embarrassed that he‚Äôd kept this from me and figured I would have left him had I known sooner. I was upset that this was a secret - but reassured him that I wasn‚Äôt going to leave - but that we needed to reexamine our priorities for the moment. He needed to deal with his debts first, and then we could plan our future. 

He agreed and said he felt a great deal of relief that he‚Äôd told me.

Things felt okay from this point on.
We met with a financial planner and the debt counsellor - they approved his debt relief plan and payback - and put him on a budget that would allow him to be debt free within 3 years.

We continued as normal and things felt positive.

In mid nov he proposed he move in with me - and we rent out his home to bring in some extra income to pay down his debt sooner - I agreed. The plan was for a move in date of Dec 1st. Today. The only caveat being that we both sign cohabitation agreements that neither of us have interest in each others debts, or shared properties. That any debts incurred from the time we begin cohabitating are to be on dual signature and anything outside of that are not the others responsibilities. He agreed however has delayed in signing the contract that was drawn up.

Everything else seemed on track. 

Last week Friday Greg texted me - insisting I invest 20k in the market via his day trading. I responded with a ‚Äú?‚Äù - my father is a financial planner and his brokerage takes care of all of my investing. I reminded Greg of this, and said I appreciate his thinking of me though. 

He told me I was making a HUGE mistake because the market was about to take a turn and that 20k would be 200k within the week. I declined. He reiterated that I was making a bad decision and should listen to him. I reminded him that I let my dad‚Äôs brokerage handle my investments. He pushed again.
Finally I was frank and said that I felt like day trading felt a lot like gambling and wouldn‚Äôt place my money there as I‚Äôm cautious looking out for my future and my kids and then asked him if he was even allowed to participate in day trading with his consumer debt proposal (they had a great deal of stipulations of things he was not permitted to do, like incur more debt or gamble). He didn‚Äôt respond.

I was busy at work and just left it.

That afternoon I called him to see if he wanted to meet up for drinks after work as we usually did and he sent me to voice mail. 

I called him again a few hours later and received the same. 
I sent a text, asking him if we were meeting up and he left me on read.

I called and his phone was off.

I was pretty upset. Not once in our 16 months have I ever been ignored - nor have we ever really had a fight.

I figured I‚Äôd let him cool off and would hear from him Saturday. 
Silence.

Today - I reached out again asking if we could talk - and his response was ‚ÄúYou obviously don‚Äôt trust me. This isn‚Äôt going to work. Take care‚Äù

I am gobsmacked.

I reached out to his mom whom I‚Äôve been extremely close with and her response to me was that Greg has asked for his family not to communicate with me and mine, and instructed them to not get involved, to provide him with the space and time he needs to move on.

I feel sick to my stomach.

I realize there has to be MUCH more going on here than I was aware of. 
From a man‚Äôs perspective - can you tell me what I did wrong or did I dodge a huge bullet here like my dad assures me I did.

1h4k9nu,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1h4k9nu/trash_talking_manager_who_also_cares_about_me/,Trash Talking Manager (who also cares about me?),"A few ago, I got my first job as a barista at my airport coffee shop , and it‚Äôs been a dream come true‚Äîthe best job I‚Äôve ever had. I absolutely love interacting with customers from around the world, and my coworkers make the job even better. Going to work is a privilege.

That said, things have changed since I got a new manager. At first, she was amazing‚Äîshe joked about the company‚Äôs issues and she truly cares about me. But about four weeks ago, it changed. I think she‚Äôs extremely exhausted but my coworkers think she ‚Äúgot comfortable,‚Äù but now she‚Äôs started being mean ‚Äúas a joke.‚Äù She talks trash about me and disrespects me to her close group of employees, then turns around and says she sees me like a son (which I believe). It‚Äôs confusing because on one hand, she can be supportive and protective, but on the other, her behavior feels hurtful and unprofessional. I think I've heard people say that she doesn't mean anything that she talks about.

For example, I recently switched to morning shifts after working nights for a while. On my first morning, I asked her if we were allowed to heat up pastries since it gets super busy, and she responded rudely. A customer overheard and later told me not to let anyone talk to me like that. But then a few hours later, when another customer gave me a hard time, she stepped in, asked if I was okay, and handled the situation for me. So I know she cares, but her behavior swings between extremes. She also makes inappropriate jokes and is often unreasonably mean to customers, which I think might be from exhaustion.

I don't want to stand up to her because I'm not confrontational like that I don't think that talking to her boss (or HR) will do anything... I don't have any leverage other than I would like to think that I'm a good worker (or at least have the potential). I'm just asking for basic respect, I know I'm not perfect at everything and I'm open to feedback if it's given in a professional manner. Most people think that she's hilarious and don't feel like it's hurtful that she acts like this. I feel like any effort to call her out publicly would feel like losing myself. I have had so many learning experiences with this job that it might be beneficial to just stay and go through the tough parts because I'll learn lessons on how to deal with these types of people and come out stronger? Or maybe I'm delusional.

I have had manager who made me and other people feel drained and unwelcome but (like now) I am still learning the ropes of what I should and should not do, what I can and cannot say, everyday I make mistakes and learn from them. I'm not saying it's all my managers' fault, I make mistakes but the way she approaches them doesn't make me feel respected.

I‚Äôm struggling because this is my first job, and I‚Äôm really grateful for it‚Äîthe pay is amazing, and I love what I do most of the time. But it‚Äôs hard to be on the receiving end of her behavior, even if it‚Äôs not constant. My job is already exhaustive and I don't want to drain me more but it's been on my mind for weeks. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overthinking things or if it‚Äôs fair to feel the way I feel. I've heard the service industry is just like this in general, people trash talk each other all the time but it's like she's the leader of a gossiping teenage girl group. I have hope that maybe another coffee shop would be different (outside the airport), the only thing to consider is that one day I do want to work in airport operations and having this job might teach me a lot about how an airport operates (I learn so much about life in general too everyday at my job) so IDK if it's worth it to stick it out (maybe she might leave one day). Any advice on how to handle this would mean so much to me.

Backstory - 
I‚Äôm a 42y old woman with 2 kids (6m, 10f))

My husband of 15y died in 2020 after complications from a 5y battle
with non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. 

We‚Äôd met in high school, our families remain extremely close, and we had what I can only describe as a perfect relationship. He was my best friend and I was his - he set the bar extremely high.

When we knew his cancer was incurable my husband encouraged me to grieve but then move on and find a partner because in his words ‚ÄúI was an amazing partner‚Äù and he wanted our children to witness what love looked like.

I never imagined I‚Äôd date again - however last year, on the encouragement of our families and my therapist; I put myself out there.
I went on about a dozen first and second dates, I had a 5 month long relationship with a very nice man whom I just wasn‚Äôt ready for and it ended amicably.

I have been very upfront about my loss and re/entering the dating world, and met a great guy, whom I‚Äôll call Greg, on Hinge in the late summer of 2023.

Greg is a 43y old single father with a 6y old son. Has a very stable job of 20+ years as a firefighter. Co-parents well 50-50 with his ex wife whom he split from due to her affair in 2021. 

He had 2 previous relationships after his split - one for 6 months with a young woman he knew wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere, and a second with a woman whom he‚Äôd dated out of high school - for approx 3 months who kept him ‚Äúat arms length and wasn‚Äôt affectionate enough‚Äù for him to feel he had a connection with. We met 6 weeks after his last relationship.

It felt very organic from the get go. 

We had coffee for our first date and hit it off from the get go. Tons of laughs. Had our second date for dinner a few days later that went on for 6 hours at a local pub, 3rd the same week and by date 4 he stated he was deleting the apps and wanted to date me exclusively - that he hadn‚Äôt felt connection with anyone since he had met his wife back in his 20‚Äôs.

We spent a lot of time together - he‚Äôs a shift worker and I work half time during the day as a social worker by choice. My late husband was a high income earner and he had a substantial life insurance policy that has allowed my children and I a comfortable future.

Everything seemed great.
I met his son and family around the 2 month mark - and we hit it off. I met his ex wife at the 3 month mark and again, we hit it off. She was very happy that he‚Äôd met someone - I was the first person he‚Äôd introduced to his son - and she and I got along well (at this point she‚Äôs now engaged to her guy too)

Our relationship is great. We have tons of fun together. We had a great winter and spring - travelled as much as we could. Spent the summer at our family cottage with all the kids, our friends and his parents spent a ton of time with my family and my late husbands. He earned everyone‚Äôs approval. 
Zero red flags.

At the 6 month mark, he begins talking to me about marriage - would I ever want to marry again?
Would I ever want to live with someone again?

I was finally in a place where I could say yes. 
He talked at length with my parents about this - his parents too.

In September we started talking about logistics. Would he move into my home which was larger and could accommodate all of us? No. He felt uncomfortable about that - it was a house I shared with my late husband. 
We agreed to keep our respective properties and rent them out as income properties - and buy a home together. We made a list of our dream home. Budget. 

Things started to feel real, and exciting.
We booked an appt with the bank for late Oct to get mortgage approval.
We had a very frank talk about  marriage - and he told me he wanted to get married within a year and hoped I was on the same page. I was.

So we are now at 14m into our relationship.

The morning of our mortgage appt - he called to tell me he had tested positive for Covid - and that we‚Äôd have to reschedule. I reschedule for his next day off which was Nov 13th, a Wednesday.

On the 12th, the evening prior - we had a really nice dinner out - and went over everything that we needed for this appointment. It was a great night and the vibe was really happy and positive.

The next morning - just after getting the kids off to school - he brought me a coffee and said he needed to talk to me. 

I asked him what was up - I‚Äôd never seen him so serious. 
In this moment it was like something completely changed.

Tearfully he told me that he‚Äôd kept from me that he was nearly bankrupt.
When I asked him what he meant - he said that he‚Äôd made some poor choices post divorce with helium mining (still no idea what this is) day trading and sports betting and had incurred nearly 200k in debt since his divorce. That he was insolvent - and was making a proposal for a consumer debt relief.

I was absolutely shocked.
I did not react however and just let him talk. 
He told me he was embarrassed that he‚Äôd kept this from me and figured I would have left him had I known sooner. I was upset that this was a secret - but reassured him that I wasn‚Äôt going to leave - but that we needed to reexamine our priorities for the moment. He needed to deal with his debts first, and then we could plan our future. 

He agreed and said he felt a great deal of relief that he‚Äôd told me.

Things felt okay from this point on.
We met with a financial planner and the debt counsellor - they approved his debt relief plan and payback - and put him on a budget that would allow him to be debt free within 3 years.

We continued as normal and things felt positive.

In mid nov he proposed he move in with me - and we rent out his home to bring in some extra income to pay down his debt sooner - I agreed. The plan was for a move in date of Dec 1st. Today. The only caveat being that we both sign cohabitation agreements that neither of us have interest in each others debts, or shared properties. That any debts incurred from the time we begin cohabitating are to be on dual signature and anything outside of that are not the others responsibilities. He agreed however has delayed in signing the contract that was drawn up.

Everything else seemed on track. 

Last week Friday Greg texted me - insisting I invest 20k in the market via his day trading. I responded with a ‚Äú?‚Äù - my father is a financial planner and his brokerage takes care of all of my investing. I reminded Greg of this, and said I appreciate his thinking of me though. 

He told me I was making a HUGE mistake because the market was about to take a turn and that 20k would be 200k within the week. I declined. He reiterated that I was making a bad decision and should listen to him. I reminded him that I let my dad‚Äôs brokerage handle my investments. He pushed again.
Finally I was frank and said that I felt like day trading felt a lot like gambling and wouldn‚Äôt place my money there as I‚Äôm cautious looking out for my future and my kids and then asked him if he was even allowed to participate in day trading with his consumer debt proposal (they had a great deal of stipulations of things he was not permitted to do, like incur more debt or gamble). He didn‚Äôt respond.

I was busy at work and just left it.

That afternoon I called him to see if he wanted to meet up for drinks after work as we usually did and he sent me to voice mail. 

I called him again a few hours later and received the same. 
I sent a text, asking him if we were meeting up and he left me on read.

I called and his phone was off.

I was pretty upset. Not once in our 16 months have I ever been ignored - nor have we ever really had a fight.

I figured I‚Äôd let him cool off and would hear from him Saturday. 
Silence.

Today - I reached out again asking if we could talk - and his response was ‚ÄúYou obviously don‚Äôt trust me. This isn‚Äôt going to work. Take care‚Äù

I am gobsmacked.

Tearfully he told me that he‚Äôd kept from me that he was nearly bankrupt.
When I asked him what he meant - he said that he‚Äôd made some poor choices post divorce with helium mining (still no idea what this is) day trading and sports betting and had incurred nearly 200k in debt since his divorce. That he was insolvent - and was making a proposal for a consumer debt relief.

I was absolutely shocked.
I did not react however and just let him talk. 
He told me he was embarrassed that he‚Äôd kept this from me and figured I would have left him had I known sooner. I was upset that this was a secret - but reassured him that I wasn‚Äôt going to leave - but that we needed to reexamine our priorities for the moment. He needed to deal with his debts first, and then we could plan our future. 

He agreed and said he felt a great deal of relief that he‚Äôd told me.

Things felt okay from this point on.
We met with a financial planner and the debt counsellor - they approved his debt relief plan and payback - and put him on a budget that would allow him to be debt free within 3 years.

We continued as normal and things felt positive.

In mid nov he proposed he move in with me - and we rent out his home to bring in some extra income to pay down his debt sooner - I agreed. The plan was for a move in date of Dec 1st. Today. The only caveat being that we both sign cohabitation agreements that neither of us have interest in each others debts, or shared properties. That any debts incurred from the time we begin cohabitating are to be on dual signature and anything outside of that are not the others responsibilities. He agreed however has delayed in signing the contract that was drawn up.

Everything else seemed on track. 

Last week Friday Greg texted me - insisting I invest 20k in the market via his day trading. I responded with a ‚Äú?‚Äù - my father is a financial planner and his brokerage takes care of all of my investing. I reminded Greg of this, and said I appreciate his thinking of me though. 

He told me I was making a HUGE mistake because the market was about to take a turn and that 20k would be 200k within the week. I declined. He reiterated that I was making a bad decision and should listen to him. I reminded him that I let my dad‚Äôs brokerage handle my investments. He pushed again.
Finally I was frank and said that I felt like day trading felt a lot like gambling and wouldn‚Äôt place my money there as I‚Äôm cautious looking out for my future and my kids and then asked him if he was even allowed to participate in day trading with his consumer debt proposal (they had a great deal of stipulations of things he was not permitted to do, like incur more debt or gamble). He didn‚Äôt respond.

I was busy at work and just left it.

That afternoon I called him to see if he wanted to meet up for drinks after work as we usually did and he sent me to voice mail. 

I called him again a few hours later and received the same. 
I sent a text, asking him if we were meeting up and he left me on read.

I called and his phone was off.

I was pretty upset. Not once in our 16 months have I ever been ignored - nor have we ever really had a fight.

I figured I‚Äôd let him cool off and would hear from him Saturday. 
Silence.

Today - I reached out again asking if we could talk - and his response was ‚ÄúYou obviously don‚Äôt trust me. This isn‚Äôt going to work. Take care‚Äù

I am gobsmacked.

I reached out to his mom whom I‚Äôve been extremely close with and her response to me was that Greg has asked for his family not to communicate with me and mine, and instructed them to not get involved, to provide him with the space and time he needs to move on.

I feel sick to my stomach.

I realize there has to be MUCH more going on here than I was aware of. 
From a man‚Äôs perspective - can you tell me what I did wrong or did I dodge a huge bullet here like my dad assures me I did.

We‚Äôve had a pretty good relationship overall, but recently, I‚Äôve started feeling a little insecure. He‚Äôs always been super sweet and caring, but he‚Äôs also gotten closer with some of his friends recently, and I‚Äôve started to wonder if I‚Äôm not as much of a priority to him as I used to be.

A few weeks ago, I noticed that he was texting someone a lot more than usual. At first, I tried to brush it off, thinking it was just a friend or something. But the more I saw it, the more curious I got. He‚Äôs been super secretive about his phone lately, which is not like him. He usually leaves it around, but now he always seems to keep it on him, even when we're hanging out or when we‚Äôre in bed together.

One night, after a few too many questions about his texts going unanswered, I made the decision to go through his phone while he was sleeping. I know, I know‚Äîit was a huge violation of trust, but I just had this gut feeling that something wasn‚Äôt right. I was expecting to find something suspicious‚Äîlike maybe him flirting with someone‚Äîbut honestly, what I found wasn‚Äôt that bad. He was just talking to a girl he works with about some work stuff and making plans to grab coffee to discuss a project.

Nothing that screamed ‚Äúcheating,‚Äù but I still felt uneasy after reading the messages. I didn‚Äôt find anything explicitly wrong, but I didn‚Äôt like the fact that he was being secretive about it. When he woke up, I felt really guilty and knew I had crossed a line, but I didn‚Äôt want to tell him I went through his phone. So, I just acted normal. He didn‚Äôt seem to notice anything was off, but I‚Äôve been feeling terrible about it ever since. I‚Äôve been wondering if I should tell him what I did, or just leave it in the past.

Now I‚Äôm really conflicted. I know it was wrong to invade his privacy, and I shouldn‚Äôt have done it, but I also feel like I had a right to know what was going on, especially if something shady was happening. So, AITA for going through his phone? Should I come clean, or is this just something I should forget about?",2,1733105377.0,AITAH,7,0.75,False
1h4k547,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1h4k547/i_dont_understand_what_went_wrong/,I don‚Äôt understand what went wrong,"I recently met a beautiful girl in her early 20‚Äòs.

We went out to get a coffee bc I wanted to do something simple and bc I didnt have many dates in my life.

First off I thought that she was way out of my league but afterwards she assured me that it had nothing to do with my looks.. she actually found my cute (which I don‚Äôt understand tbh) 

We started talking about her time in uni and I started talking about my life.. at the beginning I was kinda nervous but then I calmed down and actually acted normal for my standards.. 

I held eye contact.. but not too much like a creep and we laughed and everything seemed fine. 

But after the date, a few days later she told me that I seemed insecure and too shy for her.. and that she looks for a man that acts more dominant.

And thats the problem, I acted completely normal and talked a lot and all, there is just no way that I acted shy or something like that.. and you cant really expect a person to be dominant (whatever that means on a first date) 

So why did she tell me this? Do I have a completely wrong perception of myself or is she just expecting too much..

I dont mind if she is just not into me but saying that I seem insecure just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.. talking about this on reddit doesn‚Äôt make me look like a confident person probably but I can assure you that I was calm and talkative and definitely not shy..

So do I just not care what she said or is there something that I can learn from this :/

LONG STORYY WARNING,TL;DR AT THE END

for context,most couples in my country tend to 
have sex really early in the relationship and at a really young age(sometimes even the first week,most lose their virginity by 14)

now 17M,16 at the time of this story,

i was still a virgin,that coupled with the fact that i never found myself attractive and i was a late bloomer compared to most led me into  a suicidal,depressive dark spiral
i also was heavily abusing alcohol and benzos at this time

i met a girl at school,let's call her H,H introduced me to her friend F 

F and me started texting every day and hanging out,first as friends and then everything started changing after she gave me my first kiss

we had a really rough fight when during an hangout she jokingly called me a 'little virgin',knowing very well of my insecurity

i ended up going home early and drank enough until i fell into a suicidal stupor and ended up texting her how i felt,and how i was going to inevitably put an end to my own life as i was undesirable 

she tried to calm me down,and she eventually did and later told me she wanted a relationship with me,and that she truly fell in love with me 

this was truly a bad start to our relationship,but i ended up agreeing that i wanted to be with her

she was the first woman to truly find me attractive,and one of the first ever times i felt wanted sexually & romantically

our relationship was honestly doing great,and we were truly dedicated to eachother,but the question of my virginity was still bugging me considering that 'newlywed' couples of the same age around us were wildly fucking and we simply..were not

also considering that she kept texting about how sexually attractive she found me,but of course never showed it and i started feeling ugly again

around the three month mark,we were hanging out every day and started messing around sporadically,but nothing concrete really happened

even as i was lost in the delirious ocean of rum,vodka and a lot of benzos,i took moments to collect my shit and calmly explain to her my feelings regarding the matter,what i said was,in short;

- i felt lied to considering all the provocative stuff she said but it never being actualized
-if she was not comfortable acting sexually with me in the moment,i was willing to wait to a certain extent
-and that if she simply did not find me sexually attractive or simply did not feel like wanting to do anything sexual with me for a long time,then we were better off breaking up 

it took me hours to perfect this talk as even though some resentment had grown,i still loved her and i wanted it to come off as non-coercive,and rational as possible hoping  not to get emotions involved

well,they did every time i kept trying to have this talk

eventually,after a couple of other months staying with her in what seemed to be a poly relationship including my distress gnawing at my bones(and according to her,hers too),as we were getting ready to hang out,i inevitably snapped and canceled the whole thing

..i was a dead man barely latching onto life,with hard liquor melting my liver and my heart dragging itself,being heavier and heavier 

that day though,i lost all attachment i had to life for quite a long period,i gave up

..i really could not stand it anymore,she did it with her ex almost instantly,but i had to wait and wait?
the closest we got to doing the deed,she kept shaming me that some positions were not for 'virgins' and i got cockblocked by her brother after we spent minutes trying to find a 'virgin safe' position
it was probably the most humiliating thing i experienced to date

i was attracted to this woman,and her attraction to me felt like a lie 
i gave up,i told her i was done with her and that i'm going back on the original deal i made myself

that i'm simply gonna find somebody else to lose it to

she had a breakdown and reacted so badly,so damn badly..but the kind of suffering she told me she felt that evening i felt for the last few months every waking moment of mine that somehow involved her,even as i was still in love with her

she had done me in,i feltas if i was never gonna be desired and that maybe it was time to drink my last cocktail,have my last valiums and go meet the maker

i broke up with her and well,i did not meet the maker that day,i ended up blacking out

we talked for a while post breakup,and eventually ended up blocking eachother and deleting our chats

i talk with H again and life is depressing,full of liquor but without the added strain on my heart,which i guess feels better


i eventually started moderating my alcohol use over the summer so it would be a few shots of iced rum at night on the weekend,and not rum with my coffee first thing in the morning followed by way more shots throughout the day 

it worked,i really was getting my shit back together by going sober even as if i was still suffering from a heavy,soul consuming depression

i killed what was my biggest demon.

then..news i would have never expected came,and they came through the weirdest way

H wasn't really interacting with me once i got back to school post summer break,i wondered why and eventually met her at recess

she broke news..news that i really will never forget

my ex,as revenge,had accused me of coercing her for sex,sex that never really happened,calling it 'rape'

even in my chaotic mental state of alcoholic delirum,i never wanted to coerce her and always made sure she would never feel coerced,she never communicated to me that she felt coerced and i always made sure my talks were as clear,rational as possible

i ended up doing something incredibly childish as revenge,eventually H confronted me in regards of the question and me and her got close back again..closer than ever actually,if you get what i'm saying

H no longer thought of me as a rapist,but eventually got close again to my ex after having a small affair with me,my ex probably knows nothing.


The situation is resolved now,i no longer face any accusation and i can say i got to do some interesting things with an hot woman(H)

i got my 'revenge',got clean and now i'm way more emotionally stable

But it still troubled me,i have slept around but i cannot see myself as a sexual being and thus struggle with hookups and anything sexual





...to brighten the mood,i 'won',but at what cost?


well,the cost of not being able to see myself as a sexual being and not being able to see myself as sexually attractive to anyone,to the cost of having bad memories with sex

i assume many way older folks in DBs experienxe the same thing after leaving a DB,struggling with anything sex related for a while especially seeing yourself as desiderable

for those that have overcome those post-db issues,any tips one can use to feel desiderable again?even during hookups and not long term relationships?

PS:writing this on a relapse,i'm drunk enough so i hope this will come alright


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TL;DR;distressed about being a virgin in a society where everyone loses it early,meet my ex,fall into a db,leave her as a result and get accused of coercing her for sex thus staining my reputation

have a sort of fling with her best friend as revenge,got rid of the accusations,got clean from alcohol and benzos,but still damaged from relationship especially sexually

how to solve post-db psychological issues,such as being unable to feel desirable and being unable to feel like a sexual being?

Thank you so much for the welcome, both online and on the places we visited. City of the Smiles gayud! 

There are so much more places and food I want to explore. 

- Balay Negrense was closed for renovations. Hofeli√±a Museum and Bernardino Jalandoni Museum very much makes up for it. 

- Emma Lacson's empanada is soo yummy. We hesitated opening that green gate, and was welcomed by a clutter of cats. Next time, pili squares!  

- Cafe 1925 is no longer serving KBL. Batwan bar and the pesto pasta with chicken inasal are delicious though! Diin namit na KBL? ü§©

- We also missed out on Guapple pie from El Ideal, it was already sold out! Need to be there in the early morning for those fast selling pies. 

- I need to add 1 night in Silay to properly explore the Paris of Negros. 

- Mambukal Resort needs to be a 2-night stay, because you'd want to soak in the onsen and on the pool the entire day! 

- Native coffee is everywhere and it hits the spot everytime. Just the right kind of black coffee for me. Then, when you add the muscovado sugar + milk, you kinda get a spanish latte of your own creation. 

- The food! I want to explore more outside of Chicken Inasal, but of course, babalikan ko tagala din ang chicken inasal. But discovered pancit molo, it was namit gid! I want to try Roli's napoleones! üò≠ 

- The roads! Ganda siguro mgroadtrip dito! I can smell the freshly harvested sugar cane from the bus window. 

- The people! You guys are so kind! Each grab driver patiently answered my questions,  Q: Diin best chicken inasal/cansi place po? We get some consistent answers and some varied ones that lead us to amazing eats! One manong smiled at me while taking pics sa trees. Sorry na manong, ang laki kasi nang trees dito. People at both museums are knowledgeable and very patient in sharing the historical facts. I love how proud you are of your history and heritage!

It was a delightful sight. There's been massive snowstorm all over my country but my area only got a dusting. Still, the snow fell in the morning and it is still hear tonight which is a surprise. I don't remember it snowing and staying this early last years. I want to say it's a good sign. Right before it snowed I saw a seagull eating chips on the road and I went outside to throw some food out for it. It's mostly lost under the snow now but I'm sure the birds will be appreciating it eventually. I also started that 24 days of Coffee that Mother bought me. The first day was Cr√®me br√ªl√©e. I can't say the taste struck me as very 'Cr√®me br√ªl√©e' but I did enjoyed it nothing the less.

I'm quite tired now. I did stay up later than I wanted to because my parents were up earlier than usual. Father was playing his music again. I'm struggling to write and finish this note. Well, why struggle when you can just stop? So here, my note will stop.

I'm doing it, but I notice less gym and more work has been the norm so I did what any normal person would do and bought some DMMA, I still don't feel the fire, I mean dmma is amazing but I don't feel the need for the gym, and I feel 0 energy outside of the gym since Ive recently try to limit caffeine intake outside of the gym.

Current pre is motherbucker (350) + Ryse bcca (150)

Now I'm boarding trying something stronger and seeing the issue maybe with me, anyone else go through this?

My other option is to quit it all together for a bit, it took me 2 months to stop yawning when I'm at the gym after I quit pre last time.

Right now I take it 1-3 times per week, coffee at least 2 shots daily( which isn't much).

4. Soda: This one is the easiest. Unfortunately stuck with a diet coke 6 pack - so as soon as I get it over with, no more buying soda. Of the 4 infact, I have the greatest self control with diet soda (maybe once every fortnight or so)

Stop wherever you are. Stop falling more and more deep. The result is only sorry, grief and regret. How many times, did we fall into the same sin? relapse, regret, repeat! Did we unlock something new? No! It is the same thing every time, no matter how many times we do or what new ways we do it. No surprise and the end is sorrow and regret.

Listen to what Allah says in the Quran Sura Al-Baqara Verse no 208.

O you who believe! **Enter into Islam whole-heartedly**; And **follow not the footsteps of the Satan;** For he is to you an avowed*(stated(publicly) or admitted)* enemy.

1. Stop whatever you are doing now
2. Shutdown your phone
3. Go take a cold shower.
4. Do Thawba! and go out somewhere you like. How about a coffee? meanwhile listen to a motivational Islamic video while sipping a hot coffee to get you back on track.
5. Come back to clean your environment.
   1. Clean your room first
   2. Clean your phone or any device you used to sin.
6. Get back to work, study, be disciplined. 
7. Create a productive routine and start doing it right away.

The next morning, Adam woke up with a big smile. He was happy but also realized he needed a bigger bed. When he tried to get up, she turned, smiled, and joined him.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt know you had become an early riser? Last I remember I couldn‚Äôt get you out of bed before ten.‚Äù He winked, and she shrugged.

‚ÄúThe navy does that to you. Now, it‚Äôs a habit. Coffee? Still extra black?‚Äù She replied.

‚ÄúYeah, I fear the day I run out of it. I think I bought 500 kg, but it's getting popular among the others, so I think I will run out soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you won't. Have you heard of a Navy ship without coffee? Besides, you haven‚Äôt opened your gift yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy gift?‚Äù

‚ÄúFrom Harold.‚Äù She winked, and Adam looked confused.

They dressed, and she made him coffee, scrambled eggs, and noodles. He laughed when he saw it. It was one of the few things she could cook back in the orphanage, and she had made it for him many times. They ate, and then he took her to the administration to watch the kid's work.

‚ÄúYou have added child labor to your crimes?‚Äù She asked in amusement as the kids came in; they stopped as they saw her. One of the girls whispered to Kywar, and he grinned.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Adam asked, and Kywar cheekily replied. ‚ÄúShe asked if we had to leave so you could get married again.‚Äù

Both Adam and Evelyn laughed, and the kids took it as a sign they could enter. Adam gave them today's tasks and let the kids loose; several drones flew out from the base, some from satellites running scans of target areas in the asteroid fields. Adam explained that the kids love doing it, mostly because of the after-work play. Evelyn walked over and watched the kids scan and then looked at Adam.

‚ÄúHas this plane been scanned for archeological signs?‚Äù

Adam shook his head.‚Äù No, I was told it was a dead planet, the whole system is dead.‚Äù He replied, and she leaned down to a Bylgyno girl. ‚ÄúMind turning back to those rocks you just passed?‚Äù

She looked at her, nodded, and turned the drone back, having it hover over the group of stones. Adam looked at it, and his eyes went wide. Evelyn looked at him.

‚ÄúShitt, we need archaeologists; that‚Äôs a building‚Ä¶‚Äù The stones were stacked on top of each other in a straight line and a clear L shape. There was also a small I-shaped cluster next to it.

‚ÄúGiralo? Can you do a deep scan of this area? I would like to know what type of stone is present and the stone's position in a 500-meter radius and a department of 50 meters. Can you do that?‚Äù Adam asked, and the kids looked at them. The Bylgyon girl smiled and nodded, then accessed the scanning controller and started the scan. The boy next to her turned to ask.

‚ÄúWhat are you looking for?‚Äù

‚ÄúOld building, like over a thousand-year-old building,‚Äù Adam replied. Evelyn walked along the screens and checked for more.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can you recognize them just by looking at rocks?‚Äù A wossir girl asked. She tilted her head. The green no shell turtle aliens were generally not so curious, but their kids still were. Or they had hung around Kywar too long.

‚ÄúRocks very rarely get stacked in a straight line by themselves; people tend to do that. So any rock formations that look like a rectangle, square, triangle, or any such shapes with straight walls is interesting to check out.‚Äù Evelyn said. At the mention of the wall, all the kids looked at the walls, and a lightbulb went off as they started to speak quickly about potential places.

Adam looked at Evelyn. ‚ÄúNow we need an archeologist. I have a feeling we will get a few more sites of interest.‚Äù

The grown-ups started to pour in, and Adam looked at Vorts and then asked him where they could contact archeologists. Vorts looked confused. He knew about historians but had a hard time understanding archeologists. Anything that was dead and buried was of no importance to them. He could ask for him, but she didn‚Äôt think the university had anybody in that field. Dead civilizations were failed civilizations, so why study them? Adam knew better to argue there and simply asked him to check around. Evelyn gave him a look as they left the room.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have archeologists?‚Äù She seemed surprised.

‚ÄúYeah, orphanage either; Roks didn‚Äôt understand the concept. Prisons are considered cruel and torturous punishments. They would prefer death to prison. They do have something called a social administrator‚ÄîI have no idea what it is‚Äîand an editor constructor whose job is to check and edit buildings after they are made, not to be confused with a contractor. There are some strange things here.‚Äù He explained, and she tried to wrap her head around it.

‚ÄúNo prison? All slaves are criminals?‚Äù She asked as she guided him toward her ship.

‚ÄúNo. No. Anybody can become a slave, but slavery is also a common punishment in the system. That‚Äôs why we have that group of workers in a separate building. We haven‚Äôt checked them out yet. I don‚Äôt want to put a violent criminal among my people. ‚Äú

‚ÄúI can understand that. You are building a prison, right? Make it a factory and have them work off their debt while being productive?‚Äù She asked.

‚ÄúOf course, there is a farm and factory being built. That‚Äôs where I will place them. They probably won't even notice it‚Äôs a prison, "" he said. I think their view of prison is very different from ours. It's probably more like a dungeon.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, if they stopped using dungeons and only used slavery, then they don‚Äôt know what a modern prison is. This is just weird. So much to get used to.‚Äù She took him to the cargo area; most of it was empty, but there were two large containers in the corner.

‚ÄúThat one is your Ares bonus package. It‚Äôs spare parts for the droids, a couple of crates of whiskey, the good stuff, and other snacks from home. Ares always adds one for customers who buy over five million Earth credits.‚Äù Evelyn smiled as she looked at the other. ‚ÄúAt 10 million, they add this baby, costumed packed container by somebody who knows what you appreciate, kind of a goody bag in container size. Harold put it together. It's their way of showing they appreciate you as a good customer and want to do more business with you.‚Äù

Adam looked at her and then at the screen on the container and saw the inventory list: coffee, lots of Coffee and beer, hiking clothes and business suits, a personal Butler droid with a training program‚Äîboxing and weightlifting edition‚Äîand five hundred regular books, among others. Evelyn grinned at him. ‚ÄúI think he knows you pretty well, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, he does because he added... Ice cream and the right brand. God admits I have to repay him for this.‚Äù Adam said as Evelyn gave the ship droids an order to deliver the two containers, which had to be delivered personally before they could be unloaded.

‚ÄúJust insist on using him next time you buy from them. I can also use him and claim he is the sales rep for this system.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat sounds like a plan. Do you have anything planned now?‚Äù he said, walking over to her, and she chuckled.

‚ÄúOh no‚Ä¶ calm your horse, Adam. You have to wait; I have to send somebody to inspect the moon you gave us and then try to trick you into borrowing some construction droids once they have decided what kind of base they want. So Give me a few hours.‚Äù She said teasingly. Then she started to walk away, trying not to look at him. Adam took a few moments to admire her; he didn't understand how somebody as beautiful as her could fall for him, he didn‚Äôt understand.

He headed back inside the base and went to find Skee. She had been talking about a project, and he found her in the Academic wing going over something with Vorts and a media guy. A male scisya that he knew from the media group.

‚ÄúHey, am I disturbing you? "" he asked as he joined them. Skee smiled at him.

‚ÄúOf course not. We are just going over my project and trying to optimize it.‚Äù She turned his attention to what looked like the Skelton of a warehouse, A large underwater structure with walls but no windows. He studied it.

‚ÄúWhat am I looking at? Is this an old building?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no, this is a Aquadome. As you can see, there are living quarters for six scientists at the far end and an Aquatic hanger for a submarine. Jork turned one of the shuttles into one. This is a giant outdoor aquarium, "" She explained as she zoomed in, and he could see fish swimming around. ‚ÄúThe oceans will take a long time to seed, and this is how we can do it. This area is controlled. We can feed them and adjust the oxygen and nitrogen levels, heat, and current. It's basically an aquarium without walls, and it only works because there is no food outside. The longer operation to further away the aquatic life will spread and adjust to the new world. This is only one of the three we have built, but we plan to build many more. With your permission, of course.‚Äù She looked at him, and he smiled.

‚ÄúAre you sure they will survive?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, no earth organism yet; there are a few planets with a similar biosphere that have life; we start with them and adjust as they become more habitual to the general biosphere of the galaxy. So when it's normalized, these little beauties can adapt and be part of the system. Some as food.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù He replied.

‚ÄúOkay, what?‚Äù she looked at him confused, and Adam chuckled.

‚ÄúOkay, you can have Jork build more. I‚Äôm guessing you want hundreds of them at least.‚Äù

She smiled brightly. ‚ÄúThank you, yes, I want more. We are also working on an aquatic seed machine. That was Professor Kurn Dull idea. ‚Äú

Adam looked at the professor. ‚ÄúSeeding it with what?‚Äù

‚ÄúA Sandorian Seaweed called Hasion blue, at first, will be able to survive in the current sea with its low oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon levels. It will also help speed up the oxygen production. It's often used on the planets that have to lower their carbon percentage. ‚Äú He explained.

‚ÄúI love it. Start the project and keep me updated.‚Äù Adam said, and Krun smiled brightly. Then Adam checked his pad and decided to go back to the admin. The media guy followed him.

‚ÄúExcuse me, may I have a word?‚Äù He asked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Arus Valontur, we haven‚Äôt had time to speak much.‚Äù

Adam looked at him. He was a nice-looking man in a relaxed black suit with a blue shirt. His golden eyes studied him intently.

‚ÄúNice to meet you. What can I help you with?‚Äù Adam replied as they walked.

‚ÄúActually, I have to apologize to you. We have sent our reports of what happened here; you have been noticed by many. There is talk about you being a certain religious person, and you might have to expect some visitors. People who think you are this person. I didn‚Äôt think much about it. I mean, I grew up with the stories about him, but I never believed it was real.‚Äù

Adam chuckled. ‚ÄúNeither do I. Look, half of those prophecies only apply because I am a foreigner to this side of the galaxy, and I have been raised with views that seem alien to this part. Any human coming here would react like I did about slavery. ‚Äú

‚ÄúOh, I'm smart enough to understand that. I just feel I should warn you. If you want to, then I will try to spread those sentiments as well, maybe interview a few of the other humans here. It‚Äôs the least I can do. I have seen religious fantasizing up close before, and I don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù Arus replied, and Adam nodded.

‚ÄúYou have to get permission from the major before you interview her men, but I will put in a good word for you. I don‚Äôt think it will be a problem.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you. I‚Äôm looking forward to it. I will leave you to your work now.‚Äù Then he left, and Adam went to the administration office.

The next went by in a blur, Jork worked on several projects, and Adam had to order him to stop and rest. He sent both him and Skee on a private date in the bar while he and Evelyn babysat Miker, exploring the cave of wonder as it was now called. The Erath military had decided on a base and started the construction, and Vorts had not found any archaeologists, so they reprogrammed two scientist droids to study the sites to determine if they were structured or natural. The kids had located fifty-three of them. All have been quarantined to avoid Jork accidentally building a factory on them.

Then, ten days after Roks had left flight control, Adam was informed that thirteen warships had entered the system.

A little bit of backstory on why I even searched this up in the first place. Also, please don't hate on me unless I'm wrong.. which, I'm not. >.< action je, i tau but... ni mesti exposed yknow.

My whole family (excl me) supports this brand and proclaim proudly that ""Wah, it's a local brand - must #sapotlokal!"" Little do they and probably millions of Malaysians know that this has already been bought over by a Filipino billionaire with **his daughter, an heiress, owning the majority stake**. Side note, I do like some of their coffees but not all and I also have their app/an account for ease of use but I don't die die buy their coffee. My mom will go out of her way just to get their coffee.. alamak.

Facts:

1. ICSY and VTJH, the key executives of ZUS Coffee, founded the business in **2019** to make specialty coffee affordable for everyone, every day.
2. The brand's app is by far one of the best I've seen for a coffee-brand app, even surpassing St\*rbucks (IMO), a well-known and longstanding brand.
3. It IS a home-grown Malaysian brand in the sense that the founders, Ian and Venon are Malaysian and the whole brand identity from 2019 was from Malaysian brains lol. I can't say if brand identity has changed since Janica came on board because she's got her vast expertise in fast expansion of FnB brands.
4. Like many brands hoping to grow big, I believe the founders gave up their ownership rights in place of capital investment from Frank. This is seen from the shareholder % as at 22 Jul, 2024: The shareholding structure of Zuspresso looks fragmented. Besides **co-founder ICSY**, who owns a **21.27%** stake, the company has another 15 shareholders. They include **chief operating officer VTJH (0.49%)**, head barista...

As of a month ago, Z\*S has appeared on SG shores with throves of Msians taking to socmed to #sapotlokal and this is where I step in and would like to caution because it is NO LONGER Malaysian-owned.

I've been using pre since the Jak3d days And recently had 0 power in the gym to the point where I'm dragging my feet.

I'm doing it, but I notice less gym and more work has been the norm so I did what any normal person would do and bought some DMMA, I still don't feel the fire, I mean dmma is amazing but I don't feel the need for the gym, and I feel 0 energy outside of the gym since Ive recently try to limit caffeine intake outside of the gym.

Current pre is motherbucker (350) + Ryse bcca (150)

Now I'm boarding trying something stronger and seeing the issue maybe with me, anyone else go through this?

My other option is to quit it all together for a bit, it took me 2 months to stop yawning when I'm at the gym after I quit pre last time.

She is not that into religion(funny enough I know more about her religion than her) but I repsected her bielefs. Being a man tho if you don't tell me no and you tell me that you are not sure I see it as theres still a chance. We kept seeing each other more often and the connection was even more deep and better, it wasnt akward at all. She started getting really close to me,asked me questions about my life, laughed at every jokes(even the unfunny ones), touched me on my leg/shoulders and got really close to me all the time,she would give me compliments, adjusts her looks in front of me and asked if she looked good, she bought me coffee and I would too of course and we would see eachother 2/3 times a week for multiple hours. I really perceived these as her letting me know that she was interested and she changed her mind on a lot of things we discussed about how a relationship should be(\*she's from a muslim a country and only came into my country a year ago so her idea of a relationship is really traditional). I respect all her boundaries and I love our complexity. We discussed a lot about religion of course and we both don't have the same views and she asked me for my opinion on a lot of things and she said she loved my perspective because I read the quran and the bible in my life and she couldnt understand why I didnt believe in god, but I explained it and challenged her to think because she never questioned it and she said she liked how I viewed these things(she said she doesnt think im going to hell, lol I dont think she read the quran but whatever). She started calling me ""habibi"" and called things I did cute, so from that point I was like lets go im really in I finnaly have someone that loves me and that I can share a romantic relationship with. Few days later she calls me bro in a text... so I text back to her in a joking way how do I go from habibi to bro ahah, and she said that I didnt see it the right way and that she didnt mean habibi like that... So I start questioning every signals she gave me and for me it was really clear these were signals of love and interests. So we dont really text after that I wanted to see her in person. Of course it's still not akward in person we still laugh and talk about a lot of stuff, but I bring up the convo and said that I received a lot of mixed signals and that I'm confused, I said I care for you I want to be more than a friend and that I would like to know if she is interested in that idea or no. She gave me the same answer, I dont know, im not sure... I told her that I really needed an answer for my own good and not to be led in the dark, she kept saying she doesnt know and that made me lose my mind a bit and I said ""That I didnt care about her that much"" probably in a defense mechanism and apologised instantly after because I didnt mean it and it got out of my mouth without a thought and I still regret it. So she said no. I said I understand, and that anyway I didnt think it wouldve worked out because of our different beliefs(wich I did believe and we talked about it and we both agreed that this would be a problem, having read the quran I know how this religion sees atheists like me, so her family wouldnt accept me and that her being a women couldnt marry outside of religion, even christans or jews). This got her pissed off and she said that I don't know that and that It could've worked and that religion isnt that big of a problem (uh?!) and she started saying that all men are the same and said I had no emotions( I should've said something there because this truly affected me and it still does, ive never been that open with anyone,I normally dont show my true self and emotions to anyone in case of being hurt but I thought she understood me and liked me for who I am. I also showed her how much I truly care for her and that she can trust me in any way shape or form), this made me so sad and made me realise that maybe she didn't truly see who I was and that all I wanted from her was sex or to use her, when that is not the case, I want a best friend that can love me and that I can love back, sex is the last thing I care in a relationship(im autistic so makes sense). We agreed to be friends, even tho I don't really want another friend I have enough, but I didn't want to say no at that time. Later when we walked back to our place, she repeated that all men are the same and that I have no emotions and I felt that she was meaning it, she even mentionned one of her friend(talking stage I think) from where she comes from and told me that he wouldve never said something like that to her(she mentionned him one time before and she said he was not the right guy for her), when she said that it was like she was stabbing me and twisting the knife in my heart, but I held those emotions inside of me. That night I texted her to apologise for what I said, even after apologising in real life because I wanted her to know that I truly care for her and she said she didnt really care and that she knew I didnt mean it. The next day we saw eachother again, I bought her coffee(last time I will do that, but I wanted to make a small gesture to apologise). It wasn't akward, but I tried to not see her as a lover this time and I pushed back on some  of her flirting and it made her not act usual I dont know how to say she was fixing me more and stuff like that weird. She said she had to go, normally I would leave with her at the same time, this time I said fine bye I'm finishing my project and guess what she did! SHE FUCKING STAYED LIKE WTF ? she said I need to leave, so I said ""ok bye"" im not your boyfriend you can go, and she found a bs story that she had to stay longer, so I she waited for me to finish my project(took like 45 minutes),while she was doing nothing on her phone and then we left. While we were on the metro we talked like we used too, I would normally give her a hug but I'm trying to not give myself these feelings again so I didn't and I could see by her face she was confused. So thats the last time I saw her a couple of days ago. Another thing I noticed(this might be a stretched but) she put her insta activity on while we text for a longer period of time. It's never on but I know shes on her god damn phone all the time. So the only time in 3 months she had her activity on was while we were texting back in forth, last night she put it back on(I know she puts it on because insta says if someone has it turned off or no its pretty obvious) and I didn't text her , im not giving her as much free attention as before, im acting like a friend thats what she wants and she turned it off after like 30 minutes, I was texting my long time good friends and I noticed that lol. Last night it was pretty weird, I remembered what she called me(you're like all the other men/all men are the same/you have no emotions) when I opened up to her and showed vulnerability and all my emotions hit me like a truck, I cried for a solid hour in bed and all I could think about was how she thought this of me after she got to know me and how I showed my emotions to her. I'm pretty tired of all these mixed signals, she's a really kind and nice women but she took too much energy from me. I don't know if I can see her as a friend and its her call, because I won't initiate in texting or make meet up plans if she doesnt, because im not her boyfriend and she made it clear she wanted to be friends. She did text first sometimes but it was pretty rare. I want to take some distance what ever happens and put all that attention I gave her for myself, after all this do you guys think I should be staying friends with her(I do love her personality), or will it hurt me in the long run? and also shoud I discuss with her what she said to me and how much it affected me? I'm not sure how to bring that up but I don't know if I should show vulnerability to her ever again after that.

Rosacea is a chronic skin disease that affects more than 16 million Americans. The cause of rosacea is still unknown, and there is no cure. However, research has allowed doctors to find ways to treat the condition by minimizing its symptoms.

There are four subtypes of rosacea. Each subtype has its own set of symptoms. It is possible to have more than one subtype of rosacea at a time.

Rosacea‚Äôs trademark symptom is small, red, pus-filled bumps on the skin that are present during flare-ups. Typically, rosacea affects only skin on your nose, cheeks, and forehead.

Flare-ups often occur in cycles. This means that you will experience symptoms for weeks or months at a time, the symptoms will go away, and then return.

# Types of rosacea

The four types of rosacea are:

* **Subtype one**, known as erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (ETR), is associated with facial redness, flushing, and visible blood vessels.
* **Subtype two**, papulopustular (or acne) rosacea, is associated with acne-like breakouts, and often affects middle-aged women.
* **Subtype three**, known as rhinophyma, is a rare form associated with thickening of the skin on your nose. It usually affects men and is often accompanied by another subtype of rosacea.
* **Subtype four**¬†is known as ocular rosacea, and its symptoms are centered on the eye area.

# [Symptoms of rosacea](https://tinyurl.com/mrh4myps)

Rosacea symptoms are different between each subtype.

# Signs of rosacea ETR:

* flushing and redness¬†in the center of your face
* visible broken blood vessels
* [swollen](https://tinyurl.com/mrh4myps)¬†skin
* sensitive skin
* stinging and¬†burning skin
* dry, rough, and¬†scaly skin

# Signs of acne rosacea:

* acne-like breakouts and very¬†red skin
* oily skin
* sensitive skin
* broken blood vessels that are visible
* raised patches of skin

# Signs of thickening skin:

* bumpy skin¬†texture
* thick skin on nose
* thick skin on chin, forehead, cheeks, and ears
* large pores
* visible broken blood vessels

# Signs of ocular rosacea:

* bloodshot¬†and¬†watery eyes
* eyes that feel gritty
* burning or stinging sensation in the eyes
* dry, itchy eyes
* eyes that are sensitive to light
* cysts on eyes
* diminished vision
* broken blood vessels on eyelids

# [What causes rosacea?](https://tinyurl.com/mrh4myps)

The cause of rosacea has not been determined. It may be a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. It is known that some things may make your rosacea symptoms worse. These include:

* eating spicy foods
* eating items that contain the compound cinnamaldehyde, such as cinnamon, chocolate, tomatoes, and citrus
* drinking hot coffee or tea
* having the intestinal bacteria¬†[*Helicobacter pylori*](https://tinyurl.com/mrh4myps)
* a skin mite called¬†demodex¬†and the bacterium it carries,¬†*Bacillus oleronius*
* the presence of cathelicidin (a protein that protects the skin from infection)

# [Risk factors for rosacea](https://tinyurl.com/mrh4myps)

There are some factors that will make you more likely to develop rosacea than others. Rosacea often develops in people between the ages of 30 and 50. It is also more common in people who are fair-skinned and have blond hair and blue eyes.

There are also genetic links to rosacea. You are more likely to develop rosacea if you have a family history of the condition or if you have Celtic or Scandinavian ancestors. Women are also more likely to develop the condition than men. However, men who develop the condition often have more severe symptoms.

# [How do I know if I have rosacea?](https://tinyurl.com/mrh4myps)

Your doctor can easily diagnose rosacea from a physical examination of your skin. They may refer you to a dermatologist who can determine whether you have rosacea or another skin condition.

# How can I control my symptoms?

Rosacea cannot be cured, but you can take steps to control your symptoms.

Make sure to take care of your skin using gentle cleansers and oil-free, water-based skin-care products.

[Shop for oil-free facial creams and moisturizers.](https://tinyurl.com/mrh4myps)

Avoid products that contain:

* alcohol
* menthol
* witch hazel
* exfoliating agents

These ingredients may irritate your symptoms.

Your doctor will work with you to develop a treatment plan. This is usually a regimen of antibiotic creams and oral antibiotics.

Keep a journal of the foods you eat and the cosmetics you put on your skin. This will help you figure out what makes your symptoms worse.

Other management steps include:

* avoiding direct sunlight and wearing sunscreen
* avoiding drinking alcohol
* using lasers and light treatment to help with some severe cases of rosacea
* microdermabrasion treatments to reduce thickening skin
* taking eye medicines and antibiotics for ocular rosacea

# [Risk factors for rosacea](https://tinyurl.com/mrh4myps)

There are some factors that will make you more likely to develop rosacea than others. Rosacea often develops in people between the ages of 30 and 50. It is also more common in people who are fair-skinned and have blond hair and blue eyes.

There are also genetic links to rosacea. You are more likely to develop rosacea if you have a family history of the condition or if you have Celtic or Scandinavian ancestors. Women are also more likely to develop the condition than men. However, men who develop the condition often have more severe symptoms.

# [How do I know if I have rosacea?](https://tinyurl.com/mrh4myps)

Your doctor can easily diagnose rosacea from a physical examination of your skin. They may refer you to a dermatologist who can determine whether you have rosacea or another skin condition.

# How can I control my symptoms?

Rosacea cannot be cured, but you can take steps to control your symptoms.

Make sure to take care of your skin using gentle cleansers and oil-free, water-based skin-care products.

[Shop for oil-free facial creams and moisturizers.](https://tinyurl.com/mrh4myps)

Avoid products that contain:

* alcohol
* menthol
* witch hazel
* exfoliating agents

These ingredients may irritate your symptoms.

Your doctor will work with you to develop a treatment plan. This is usually a regimen of antibiotic creams and oral antibiotics.

Keep a journal of the foods you eat and the cosmetics you put on your skin. This will help you figure out what makes your symptoms worse.

Other management steps include:

* avoiding direct sunlight and wearing sunscreen
* avoiding drinking alcohol
* using lasers and light treatment to help with some severe cases of rosacea
* microdermabrasion treatments to reduce thickening skin
* taking eye medicines and antibiotics for ocular rosacea

Rosacea is a chronic skin disease that affects more than 16 million Americans. The cause of rosacea is still unknown, and there is no cure. However, research has allowed doctors to find ways to treat the condition by minimizing its symptoms.

There are four subtypes of rosacea. Each subtype has its own set of symptoms. It is possible to have more than one subtype of rosacea at a time.

Rosacea‚Äôs trademark symptom is small, red, pus-filled bumps on the skin that are present during flare-ups. Typically, rosacea affects only skin on your nose, cheeks, and forehead.

Flare-ups often occur in cycles. This means that you will experience symptoms for weeks or months at a time, the symptoms will go away, and then return.

All this was told me on a phone call with this girl.

A slice of real life ‚Ä¶

I have known her since middle school and we aren‚Äôt dating but have always been good friends. She tells me what‚Äôs going on in her life and I do the same with her. 

The girl is 18 with some adhd and bipolor and went to special needs classes from middle school through grad from high school. She is a virgin and has had very little dating experience. 

The guy, 19 yo auto mechanic, lives in a camper trailer by himself and carries a bottle of his fav cologne in his car (with the big boom speakers in trunk). 

He knew this girl when she was in middle school and she wanted to ‚Äúdate‚Äù him back then. He told her that he already had a gf and said that even if he didn‚Äôt have a gf, he wanted nothing to do with her ever. I knew him too and remember when this happened.

Now fast fwd 5 yrs and though she is not real pretty, she has a porn star body!

They live 40 miles apart and somehow he got her Snap and  started txting her and wanted to meet in her city for a coffee. He told her that she was. ‚ÄúJust his type‚Äù. 
Her mom knew him back then and though she didn‚Äôt really like the idea, agreed to take her to meet him in a public place. The mom lied to her husband (step-dad to girl) and told him that they were going run some errands and visit a friend.

The daughter had just gotten out of an abusive relationship with another guy she and I had known in middle school. (First real date and kiss at Homecoming - Whole soap opera on that) and step-dad was pissed at how his step-daughter was treated by this guy.

So today she met this 19 yo guy and had coffee as her mom ran some errands. 

She said he was really polite and he opened the door for her at the coffee shop and opened the car door for her when he invited her out to his car to sit  it and listen to his speakers. Uh huh ‚Ä¶

While they are in the car he grabs her ankle (she was wearing jeans) and she giggled an he said ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre ticklish‚Äù and proceeds to grab her on her calf and outer thigh. Knowing her, she giggled like a little kid. She said that he did not try to touch her boobs or anywhere else. 

Then he spritzed her arm with his cologne and she told him it smelled good. Was he ‚Äúmarking‚Äùhis territory?

By that time her mom had pulled up in her car and he got out of his car to talk to her ‚Ä¶ not sure why. 
 Then she got out and he gave her one of his car air fresheners and she went home with her mom.
 When she got home she showered and tried to wash of the cologne and said she could still smell it ‚Ä¶ and wanted too know to get it off.

Thats the true story ‚Ä¶ what do y‚Äôall think about his techniques and where this might be headed ? ",0,1733103144.0,AskMenAdvice,3,0.5,False

Decided to finally upgrade my grinder and thought I would try the ZP6.  By chance, a friend gave me a sample of third wave water right before my grinder arrived.  Bought some distilled water and tried the ZP6 for the first time.  Amazing coffee, it was the first time I've ever been able to so clearly pick out different tasting notes.  Tried another coffee, same experience.  One light roast and one medium roast from B&W.  

And then, I ran out of TWW.  Went back to my regular filtered water (here in Hawaii which is supposedly some of the best in the country).  Coffee tasted hollow.  Tried grinding finer, coffee was bitter.  Remade the same coffee 4 times in a row adjusting the grind size 2 clicks finer and 2 clicks coarser.  All tasted hollow but either bitter or astringent.   Tried this with RO + remineralized water, same experience.  

What i'm imagining from what I've read about the ZP6, is that it is unforgiving in all areas, including water quality.  So now, I have to either make my own water, or try a different grinder.  But now that I've tasted how good the ZP6 can be, everything else tastes muddy.

My partner and I go to Dutch Bros maybe every couple weeks, and they always order an oat milk shake (ever since it was a frost) and just switch up the flavor. They don't like coffee, so it's definitely not a freeze. We have ordered this many times at multiple locations with no issues at all. 

Today on my way home from work I stopped at the closest stand to us because it's my partner's birthday tomorrow and they asked me to bring home a drink for them. When I ordered their oat milk shake, the girl at the window said it wasn't possible to do an oat milk shake. I actually recognized her because she's said the same thing once before few months ago. 

I was confused then too, but figured it probably had to do with my partner wanting a seasonal flavor and maybe it wasn't possible to do it with a different milk for some reason. I didn't question it that time because it was busy and there was a line behind us. But this time I did ask (politely) whether there was maybe some other way to order it since we had ordered it before. Like maybe some other way people were putting it in without telling us it's technically some other drink. 

She even asked the other person who was making drinks and they also said no it wasn't possible, and that they could do a blended oat milk but didn't recommend it because it would be a weird texture. So I just went with that, since my partner wasn't with me and I couldn't ask what they wanted. But they were right, it's a weird thick texture and doesn't look like what my partner usually gets. I'm so confused,  I always order this the same way so I have no clue what the issue was today. I'm not sure if it was me not knowing that the drink is actually put in some other way or the people working not knowing how to do that? 

They were mostly polite too, just seemed really confused (and a little annoyed, sorry y'all if you're reading this!). I have genuinely no idea how I'm usually able to order the same thing with no problem at all. Please help lol

Me (18F) and my best friend Zack (fake name) (18M) have been friends since we were eight, we met in primary school and initially weren't really close, more of a ""friends in the same group"" situation, but after getting to know each other and hanging out every day we eventually became close. We spent every break and lunch together as a group and eventually started dating (one of those unserious pre-puberty relationships that really doesn't mean anything). After a few months of hanging out as a group I came out as bi and the rest of the group followed suit with different labels and such and Zack eventually came out as gay which was fine. At the time I had a very toxic female best friend who put me down and was very bipolar with our friendship, one day we would act like best friends and the next it would be silent treatment or threats. and after our group moved to high school, my female friend left to live with other family. This left me and Zack as the last two close friends in the group and because of that we became even closer and eventually became best friends.

During quarantine, me and Zack would face time or call each other on discord for 12-20 hours every day, spending hours and hours just watching movies, shit talking people, playing Roblox and other similar games together until odd hours of the morning, we were literally inseparable. After we came back to school, we were still close and even shared a fair amount of classes together but due to scheduling, we got put into different drama classes, this meant that I had to look for a new group to join as I didn't want to be completely alone. I made a few new friends and so did Zack so obviously we hung out in each other's new groups and eventually we all became one big group (mostly consisting of my friends but whatever.) During this time I also developed a crush on a boy from my physical education class and after a few months of talking (and a brief weeklong relationship followed by a few months of not talking) we became official. This didn't ruin my relationship with Zack, it actually strengthened it as now me, my boyfriend and Zack would play games and hang out together as a trio. About six months into my relationship (let's call this ex Mike) me and Mike started facing problems, we would argue a lot and we became on and off a lot (just a very toxic relationship from two 15 year olds that had no clue what a relationship should look like) and during one of these off periods where me and Mike decided to take a week long break away from each other (not broken up, still exclusive, just not talking to each other to give each of us a chance to breathe) Zack and Mike begin to sext and plan sneaky link sessions. After me and Mike make up, one night the three of us are on call and after telling Mike to tell me what's up since I can tell he's upset and being weird, he finally tells me what went on and sends me screenshots. Obviously I told both of them that we're done and took some time to myself but because I was/am very co-dependant in relationships and friendships, I swallowed my shame about a week later and told them both we could go back to normal if they told me it was just a sick joke and a lie (obviously very degrading to me but at that point I was in my first long term relationship and I didn't want to lose that or my friendship with Zack.)

Around 16, me and Mike broke up due to frequent arguments and an increasingly toxic relationship between the both of us, one of Mike's main issues was that I shared everything with Zack and he felt like he had no privacy in the relationship (again, a valid point but by that point I was a codependent teenager in her first proper relationship so I told my best friend everything.) After me and Mike broke up we went through a brief phase where we still hooked up and hung out but without being a couple and it didn't really work out and we ended up splitting up for good and throughout this process, Zack was there for me. I think I should also mention we've always had a ""don't ask, don't share"" relationship so we have always been there for each other through distracting ourselves from our problems rather than talking and supporting.

A year after the breakup with Mike, I got into an online relationship (let's call him Caleb) and we started dating about two weeks after meeting (I was in that cringey discord E-girl phase and I thought that you could actually make a discord relationship work, very stupid.) Caleb soon became controlling, demanding access to all of my accounts and having random calls where he would make me screenshare my phone and make me go through apps to make sure I wasn't cheating, this eventually lead to him gathering all of my information (address, full name, school, family details, number, etc) and using this to control me more (threatening to doxx me, send someone to my home, come to my home himself and k\*ll me, all very scary things for a sheltered 16/17 year old to be going through.) One of the ways he gained more control over me was by cutting my friends off, he hated Zack and monitored our chats for ages before telling me to block him and never speak to him again (Caleb told me he had reached out to people from my school who would watch me and report back to him if I spoke to Zack, obviously false in hindsight but when you're in that situation you believe it.)

I would like to mention at this point that I understand how silly it sounds being abused in an online relationship but from my perspective, Caleb had doxxed people before and was not afraid to do the same to me for small things as well as the fact that he was only a 4 hour train ride away and he could 100% find and hurt me if he wanted to. This meant that when I was told to never speak to male friends again (including Zack) I listened and while I tried my best to inform Zack of the situation, I've always felt like they downplayed my fear and thought I was ignoring them because I wanted to (this is the first part where I'm not sure if I'm the asshole)

After a long and isolated 8 months with Caleb, I was finally able to regain some self-respect and leave the relationship. The first thing I did was message Zack and apologise for icing him out and filled him in on everything that happened, it was a very emotional time for me and I spent a lot of time going between missing and hating Caleb and this is where I noticed issues with Zack arising. At this point, I understood that Zack and I went through a rough hit in our friendship, but I assumed that we'd be able to work on it but to my surprise, Zack ignored the issues and went back to normal. This was strange to me because even after telling Zack my story he never offered any support, but he also never acted distant or like there was a huge gap in our friendship, it was all very strange but I wasn't complaining, I was finally gaining friends back and recovering from one of the worst years of my life.

Around October of 2023, me and Zack had almost fully gone back to normal, there were some days where I felt neglected, but I took it as us taking a few days apart and not really seeing it as an issue. Mid-October I suggested that we go see the FNAF movie on Halloween as I've always loved the games and Halloween is our favourite holiday, Zack agreed, we made plans and I assumed that was it. Three days before we were due to see the movie, I noticed Zack completely ghosting me, our friendship is usually heavily text based since, at this point, we were in separate classes and he lived an hour away, so it became concerning when all of my messages were getting left on seen and I couldn't seem to find him in school.

Quick break from the main story but I just remembered that throughout what has happened already and continuing to this day, I have had several fall outs with mutual friends (who I knew first) due to arguments and disrespect on their end, and in almost all of these friendship break-ups, Zack has always remained close friends with these people. I have never been a ""me or them"" type of person however I see it as disrespectful since Zack understands how these people have wronged me (trying to get with my past boyfriends, getting me kicked out of clubs and programmes and even getting me sent into emergency counselling after I confronted them for talking about me behind my back to Zack which, after a few sessions of counselling, they determined I wasn't in need of it and I was in fact, right for standing up for myself \[although not so strong worded which I wholeheartedly agree with\]). I have never had any major problems with Zack hanging out with these people aside from the fact I felt a little disrespected and like my feelings weren't being heard.

Back to October, it was Halloween and Zack was still ignoring me. By this point I had sent several messages along the lines of ""If there's a problem can we speak?"" which had gone unreplied to. I was finally fed up and after a year of being disrespected by Caleb, I was over people ignoring me and treating me like shit. I ignored this feeling for a few weeks but over this time I had heard rumours of a new boy Zack was seeing and I had sent him (Zack) a few messages telling him how disrespected I felt. Two weeks after Halloween, a new friend of mine told me she had heard from one of Zack's new friends that he went on a date the day we had plans to go see the movie. This sent me over the edge and I sent them a long paragraph about how they were a horrible friend and how I was sick of being ignored and some other cruel words. This was the only message that wasn't ignored as I got a message back stating ""good, so glad we aren't friends anymore"" and then was promptly blocked.

We continued not being friends for months until January/February of 2024 where we started talking in person again and became kind of acquaintances (obviously you can never fully be nothing with someone you have that much history with, but we weren't back to fully friends yet)

Skip a bunch of friendship building over the months, we end up unblocking each other (on his alt account) and even go to a few concerts together, we start gaming and calling again too, things seem fine. About 2 weeks ago, we were facetiming and I ask them if they want to be in a photo for my Instagram note and he says no, I ask if he wants to cover his face and he says no, he doesn't want people knowing we're hanging out. Obviously this immediately upsets me as, by this point, we have confirmed that we are back to being best friends with each other (although I never really believed his side of it) and when I asked him about it, he told me that because he still hung out with people who I had burnt ties with in the past, he didn't want them to see we were friends and have them cut him off. After further investigation, he finally told me that these girls still hated me, shit talked me and had told him that they would cut him off if he continued talking to me. This prompted me to ask him if being friends with me is less important than being friends with them and if he's embarrassed by me, he never gave me a straight answer and it upset me so I ended the call and told him what he said had upset me and I would rather talk about it in the morning.

We still haven't spoken about it and honestly, I don't know if it's worth discussing. Zack has never invited me on nights out or coffee/ shopping dates, especially with other people and blames it on my financial situation/strict parents so I don't know if these are his actual reasons or if he just doesn't enjoy hanging around me or is embarrassed. I'm usually left begging to hang out with him an others which is met with an ""I‚Äôll ask"" that never comes back with an answer. The only times we hang out is when he gets off work and nobody else is available for a quick hang out so I'm usually left rushing to get ready for a last minute hangout or if we call but again, it's always initiated by me and he claims this is because ""that's the way it's always been"" and even after me begging him to try, it's still always me, he says this is because I'm busy with my new boyfriend but me and my new partner are very comfortable being away from each other and I don't put him above Zack since he knows how little we talk anyway.

There's a lot I've left out but this post is already so long and I feel like I've said enough. Me and Zack still talk to this day and we go to the same college (although in different courses) which means we sometimes spend our breaks together but recently he's been blatantly ignoring me talking to him in the halls or over text to hang out with his new friends.

I just want to know if I sound like a whiny teenager who has put herself in this situation or if Zack sounds like a bad friend and I should cut them off/try to talk to them (again) and try fix this. AITA?",3,1733102534.0,AITAH,2,0.81,False
1h4j7mm,https://i.redd.it/z1oewu3m7c4e1.jpeg,I made Pumpkin Cranberry Walnut Biscotti,"This is a freestyle bake I did today. Decided to share it with anyone who cares to try it. For the joy of baking. ü•ß

1/4 c walnut halves, chopped finely 
1/4 c dried cranberries, chopped finely
2 1/4 c all purpose flour, plus more as needed
1/2 c granulated sugar
1/4 tsp kosher salt 
1 tsp baking powder 
2 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter, softened to room temp
3 egg yolks, beaten
2/3 c fresh pumpkin puree  
1 tsp bourbon vanilla extract 
1 tbsp Bumbu dark rum
8 oz Ghirardelli white chocolate chips

First: Use a light dusting of flour to dredge together the cranberries and walnuts for better particulate suspension

Second: Sift together dry ingredients in a bowl.

Third: Blend together puree, egg yolks, vanilla, and rum in a large bowl. 

Fourth: Use a dutch whisk or silicone spatula to blend dry mixture into wet mixture. 

Fifth: Add butter and blend together, adding some dustings of flour if necessary, until dough is cohesive, but shaggy and slightly sticky. 

Sixth: Chill dough for at least 30 mins while you preheat to 350¬∞f. 

Seventh: Divide dough in half and turn onto a floured sheet of parchment. Shape into a pair of smooth logs approximately the length of a baking sheet. They should no longer be sticky. Press into long rectangles approximately 1/2 in thick and transfer parchment to baking sheet. 

Eighth: Bake in preheated oven for 20 mins. Loaves should be somewhat risen, firm to the touch, and sound hollow like bread when gently tapped. 

Ninth: While warm, use a very sharp knife to trim the ends clean and cut loaves into pieces 3/4 - 1 in wide. 

Tenth: Reduce temp to 275¬∞f and return pieces cut sides up to parchment lined sheet. Dry them for approximately 1 1/4 hrs, turning over about halfway through, until they are very dry, very firm in the middle, and crisp on the ends. 

Eleventh: While the pieces cool, in a double boiler or using a pair of bowls that fit one inside the other, melt down the chocolate pieces until very smooth. 

Twelfth: Line your sheet with a fresh parchment. Dip the pieces to the midway in the chocolate, using a small silicone spatula to push off excess, and arrange them bottom down on the sheet. Chill for 15 mins until pieces pop cleanly from the parchment and have a slight shine on the chocolate. 

Yields about 30 cookies. They should keep for at least a week at room temp in an airtight container. I'm certainly looking forward to enjoying them with my coffee for this holiday season. :) ",18,1733102527.0,Baking,2,1.0,False

We always made Christmas cookies together with my young kids, and it was a special tradition. The thought of doing it without her absolutely guts me, and I almost want to skip the tradition this year. But that makes me feel awful and sad too. Maybe doing it will feel like closeness to her memory. I just did that with Thanksgiving, I made all the dishes she usually did, and I poured her a cup of coffee and did a little ceremony in my heart for her. It was sweet and felt good but was also emotionally draining which is hard this busy time of year. I dunno. 

Any advice or experience? What did you do the first year, lean in to the painful moments and do it anyway? Skip it and regret it? Or skip it and feel OK about it? ",2,1733102436.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

1h4iw4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1h4iw4r/do_you_experience_energy_fluctuations_throughout/,Do you experience energy fluctuations throughout the week?,"The question is does your energy change throughout the week, and does that have an effect on which symptoms are more prominent? 
Note: undiagnosed ADHD; only suspected 

Okay, back story: 
I started suspecting ADHD at 15/16, and around the same time my depression and anxiety developed l. I was under a lot of stress from starting school and adjusting to it, so there were a lot of anxiety/panic attacks. I started smoking MJ around 17/18 and that came with its own ups and downs. It was pretty much slapping a bandaid on my issues. Focus, sleep, appetite, all of it. But bandaids don't help broken legs so I stopped smoking a couple of months ago. My depression and anxiety have also been pretty tame if not non-existent. 

Now, currently: I've noticed that since I stopped smoking and without my depression, my energy fluctuates throughout the week. For 2-4 days I may be low-energy and only want to do relaxing things. Listen to music, watch Netflix, read, journal. I'll be more in my head just thinking about things. It's also common for me to be a bit more grumpy, and harder to will myself to do things. I get bored easier. On these days I don't really ""wake up"" until the evening. Still, it all feels within the range of normal, not like my depression. 
On the other side of this are high-energy days. They'll last for 3-4 days. I'll wake up motivated and wanting to do things that take a bit more energy. Programming, playing music, riding my skateboard. It's easier to distract me, I'm mentally active and have a hard time staying on task, I get excited by things that interest me and run them into the ground. The downside of this is my sleep becomes screwy and I'm less engaged with other people. My fiance wants to watch something but I can't mentally engage with it. Or I'll know that I'm tired and lay down to sleep, but keep getting distracted. It could be YouTube shorts or questions that I have. With caffeine this is way worse, without it I'll drop within the next two hours. Also, oddly enough, it's harder to understand what people are saying. My audio processing system gets overwhelmed and it'll lead to either completely tuning someone out, or not being able to compute what they're saying. This happens on low-energy days too but not as much. 

Example: Yesterday I sat down to start a new programming project. I drank two cups of coffee to pep me up. I also went down memory lane with some old religious music I used to listen to, which led me to reading scripture from 3-7, which led me to question some things and sent me down a rabbit hole. I laid down in bed at 7am, but didn't actually sleep until 11am because I spent those 4hrs looking things up. Finally, I crashed and didn't wake up until 6:30. 

My therapist suggested I might be bipolar. That the low-energy days are depression, and the high-energy days are mania. I disagree. They don't feel like depression or mania, not even hypo, it just feels like I have more or less energy. I'm still in the driver's seat. But it gets tricky when I become overly engaged with something.  ",1,1733101590.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False
