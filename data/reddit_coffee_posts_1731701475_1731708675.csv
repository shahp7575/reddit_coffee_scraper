**Jake:** *\[leans back, gazing at the stars\]* So, Ken, what did you think of tonight’s meeting? That part about obeying the “Slave” even if their instructions don’t make sense—that really made me think.  
**Ken:** *\[nodding, thoughtful\]* Yeah, it was powerful. It’s a reminder to deepen our trust in those Jehovah is using to guide us. This isn’t just about loyalty—it’s about survival.  
**Jake:** True. *\[pauses\]* But here’s something I’ve been mulling over: Does Jehovah expect absolute, unquestioning obedience to them? Or is it more… relative?  
**Ken:** *\[frowning slightly\]* Jake, Jehovah commands us to obey them. Obeying them is obeying Jehovah. Disobeying them is disobeying Him. For me, that makes it absolute. It’s about loyalty to Jehovah himself.  
**Jake:** *\[sits forward, rubbing his chin\]* Hmm. That’s a strong stand. But let’s explore what absolute obedience really means. What if—just hypothetically—they directed us to stop going to hospitals when we’re sick? Would you comply?  
**Ken:** *\[hesitant but resolute\]* Of course. Even if it doesn’t make sense from a human perspective, I trust their guidance comes from Jehovah.  
**Jake:** *\[raises an eyebrow\]* Okay. But what if they told us to bow down to an image?  
**Ken:** *\[blinks, surprised\]* Bow down? Well… it’s Jehovah’s arrangement. If they say so, I’d obey.  
**Jake:** *\[leans closer, voice lower\]* And if they instructed parents to kill their firstborns?  
**Ken:** *\[visibly uncomfortable\]* That would be… hard. But Jehovah would give me the strength to obey. Remember Abraham and Isaac? He trusted Jehovah completely.  
**Jake:** *\[sits back, crossing his arms\]* So, in all these scenarios, the justification is that the Bible says to obey those taking the lead?  
**Ken:** *\[firmly\]* Exactly.  
**Jake:** *\[tilts his head\]* But Jehovah also commands obedience to governmental authorities, children to parents, and wives to husbands.  
**Ken:** *\[narrowing his eyes\]* True… but what are you getting at?  
**Jake:** *\[leaning in\]* Think about Romans 13:2: “Whoever opposes the authority has taken a stand against the arrangement of God.” Yet, if the government told us to bow to an idol or harm our children, would you obey?  
**Ken:** *\[quickly\]* Of course not! Obedience to them is relative.  
**Jake:** *\[raises a hand\]* Exactly. Even though Jehovah commands us to obey them, we recognize limits.  
**Ken:** *\[pauses, frowning deeply\]* Hmmm. I hadn’t thought about it that way.  
**Jake:** So, doesn’t that mean the command to obey those taking the lead also has limits? The fact that Jehovah commands it doesn’t automatically mean absolute, unquestioned obedience.  
**Ken:** *\[slowly\]* That’s… a good point. Even the local elders are part of “those taking the lead,” but we don’t obey them absolutely. *\[looks up at Jake\]* So where *do* we draw the line with the Governing Body?  
**Jake:** *\[smiling faintly\]* Good question. One worth thinking about carefully. *\[glances at his watch\]* Shall we continue this over coffee next time?

**Ken:** *\[still pondering, nodding absently\]* Yeah… let’s do that.

From an actual coffee perspective it’s great, but less stoked from a convenience perspective; it takes so long to heat up we don’t use it as much as we should plus it’s well out of warranty and it feels like I’m always replacing stuff which is getting old. It’s kinda blasphemous, but we’re looking at downgrading to either a Bambino Plus or Barista Pro. Since we pretty much exclusively do milk drinks, I think the convenience would be worth it. Where I get stuck is which of the two would be better. Obviously the Sette is a nicer grinder than the built in one on the Pro, but some of the downsides of the Bambino being so small sound annoying (tiny drip tray, so light the machine twists when you put in the portafilter, etc).

there’s 2 different patients that i’ve started to become friends with but i value my job and don’t want to cross any lines. we’ve always had good interactions and conversations when they come in. one of them is close to my age, we frequently end up at the same music events by happenstance and end up hanging out some just at said event. the other one happens to be a caregiver that frequents the same coffee shop as me and we’ve connected over having done similar work (i was a dsp for 3 years) and turns out were both love books and mushroom hunting. 

now i would never ask a patient to hang out when they’re just coming to get their meds, or make extra efforts to befriend one, that’s unprofessional behavior for sure. but where is the line when you line when you’re clearly just bumping into them and becoming (strictly) friends? genuinely in no way at all could it or would it be perceived as having romantic intent or otherwise, for many reasons. i’m a woman, they’re both women, and we’ve all got major long term partners but content does not trump policy

I am living lchf for more than 6 or 7 years. I recently discovered this sub and am happy, I have people to talk with about it :)


So my question is, how do you guys use bone broth? I love the taste and all, but over the yeats I came to the conclusion, that solid foods keep me full. I love soups, but they tend to not keep my hunger away for long enough and as much as I love bullet coffee or tea, they dont have much value for me.


So, how could I included bone broth as a meal or in a meal without just pushing my calories over my need? Normaly I eat 2 meals a day (morning and evening). Best would be for breakfast.


(Funny enough, while writing this, I thought about fat-cacao with mtc oil, heavy cream and stuff and this is ok. I can drink it in the morning when I dont feel like eating much protein and I dont get hungry before evening)

1gs80q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HipImpingement/comments/1gs80q6/week_1_post_op_success_so_far/,Week 1 Post Op- Success so far ,"Hi everyone 

I said i’d keep a somewhat regular log of my updates. I’m one week post surgery and all going pretty well.

Day 0 Surgery - Surgery was over 3.5 hours due to complexity. I had full labral reconstruction to reduce severe global pincers and mild cam. I was pretty out of it but managed to get home and into bed easily enough (just very very slowly)

Day 1 - Woke up very stiff and was not prepared for just how swollen my leg was, it was easily twice the size of the right. Started to do light heel slides on the couch and short walks to the kitchen to keep leg moving. Took pain meds, iced all day 

Day 2 - A lot less stiff today but leg still humongous, attempted to go outside with one crutch (I was full weight bearing but was nervous) and I got 20 meters and had to turn back. Considered getting on the bike that evening for 5 mins but didn’t have it in me. Took pain meds, iced all day 

Day 3 - Determined to get further than 20 meters today I took a second crutch and got to where i wanted - the coffee shop. Managed 5 mins on bike this evening. Still taking pain meds and icing, leg still huge. Managed my first shower using shower stool

Day 4 - Managed to get to my gym walking (400m) using one crutch slowly and used exercise bike and did some very very light machine exercises, only used ones where I could get the seat high and leg out so there was reduced flexion. Stopped taking pain meds, still icing, still swollen

Day 5 - Took bus to physio with one crutch. Gave physio the surgeon protocol and physio put me through my paces, was surprised how much I could do. Should note my physio is very across literature with FAI and recovery and is  comfortable with this type of rehabilitation. Physio told me to drop the crutch so i carried it back home. 20 mins on bike today. stopped icing as swelling gone down 

Day 6 - no pain and can walk very comfortably without crutches, walking with slight limp but reducing throughout the day, continuing to workout on bike and get short slow walks in. 

Day 7 - Started the the physio routine that was given to me and did 2 x 20 mins on bike 

I should caveat with the above that I went into this surgery very strong in the glutes and legs as suggested by my physio. I trained legs in the gym every 3 days for 9 weeks before, mainly heavy hip thrusts, box squats and single leg work.  I’m also unfortunately the type of person that will always try do too much too soon which is probably a terrible approach to recovery although it was all within (generous use of within) my guidelines. I’m just trying to be as transparent as possible as to what my week looked like post surgery.

I’ll post again when I’m a month out. Any questions feel free to ask :)",1,1731708196.0,HipImpingement,0,1.0,False

1gs7y98,https://www.reddit.com/r/limitingbeliefs/comments/1gs7y98/the_simple_truth_about_social_anxiety_and_how_you/,The Simple Truth About Social Anxiety - And How You Can Build Confidence From Within,"I want to share something powerful that will change how you see social anxiety forever.

After helping hundreds of people overcome their social fears and anxiety, I discovered something that most ""social skills advice"" completely misses.

Think about it - how many times have you:

* Been told to ""just be confident""
* Tried forcing yourself to be more social
* Practiced conversation ""techniques""
* Read endless tips about body language
* Pushed yourself out of your comfort zone

And yet... nothing really changed. Maybe you had moments of feeling better, but then fell right back into the same patterns.

Why?

Because all these methods focus on the OUTSIDE, when the real cause of social anxiety is on the INSIDE.

‎

# The Hidden Truth About Social Anxiety

The reality is - social anxiety isn't actually about ""lack of social skills"" or ""not knowing what to say.""

It's about RESISTANCE (wanting for things to be different than the way they are).

Your brain is designed to protect you from pain and danger. And it does this based on what it has learned through past experiences (your beliefs and memories).

Think back to your early experiences:

* That time you said something ""wrong"" and everyone laughed
* When you felt rejected or excluded
* Times you were judged or criticized
* Moments you felt ""not good enough""

Each of these experiences created a memory in your subconscious mind. A belief about what social situations mean.

Now, years later... whenever you're in a social situation, your mind remembers all those painful associations. And begins to create anxiety to protect you from potential pain.

This is why you:

* Overthink what to say
* Worry about being judged
* Feel your mind going blank
* Get physical anxiety symptoms
* Avoid social situations

Your mind is trying to move you away from what it perceives as danger.

‎

# Why Most Social Advice Fails

Most social skills advice completely misses this crucial point.

They tell you to:

* Practice small talk
* Use eye contact
* Work on body language
* Push through the fear
* Use conversation techniques

But here's the problem - if you have limiting beliefs about social situations being painful or dangerous... your subconscious mind will ALWAYS create resistance.

It's like trying to drive with the handbrake on. You can push the gas pedal harder (force yourself to be social), but you'll never drive smoothly until you release the brake (change the limiting beliefs).

‎

# The Real Solution: Transforming Your Beliefs

I've helped hundreds of people completely transform their social anxiety by addressing the root cause - their limiting beliefs.

One of my students had such severe anxiety he couldn't even order coffee. After we changed his limiting beliefs around social situations... within 30 days he was comfortably speaking in meetings, connecting with new people, even giving presentations.

The key is understanding that you have limiting beliefs about:

* Not being good enough
* Being judged
* Making mistakes
* Speaking up not being safe
* Not belonging
* Being different/weird

These beliefs create your social anxiety... influence your thoughts... drive your emotions... and determine your actions.

‎

# How Beliefs Control Everything

Your beliefs shape:

1. Your Perceptions:

* How you interpret social situations
* What you notice about others' reactions
* How you think others see you

1. Your Emotions:

* Anxiety levels in social situations
* How comfortable you feel expressing yourself
* Your emotional reactions to others

1. Your Actions:

* What you say and do
* How naturally you express yourself
* Whether you avoid or engage socially

1. Your Results:

* The connections you create
* How others respond to you
* Your social experiences

‎

# The Process of Transformation

Here's the step-by-step process to permanently transform social anxiety:

**1. Identify Your Limiting Beliefs**

* Notice what thoughts come up in social situations
* What do you fear might happen?
* What painful memories come to mind?
* What do you believe about yourself socially?

**2. Find Evidence Against These Beliefs**

* Look for times you were social without anxiety
* Moments you connected easily with others
* Times you expressed yourself naturally
* Situations where you felt comfortable

**3. Create New Evidence Daily**

* Focus on positive social experiences
* Notice when interactions go well
* Collect proof that contradicts old beliefs
* Build new positive associations

**4. Reinforce for 21-30 Days**

* Review your evidence daily
* Keep collecting new positive proof
* Let your mind build new neural pathways
* Allow the old beliefs to fade

‎

# What Actually Changes

When you transform these limiting beliefs, something amazing happens:

\- Words flow naturally without overthinking

\- You stop worrying about judgment

\- Physical anxiety symptoms disappear

\- You feel free to be yourself

\- Others respond to you differently

\- Social situations become enjoyable

Why? Because you've removed the invisible barriers in your mind.

You're no longer fighting against subconscious resistance. You're aligned - wanting to connect AND feeling safe to do so.

‎

# The Social Skills Part

Once you've changed those limiting beliefs, certain social skills become natural:

**1. Authentic Expression**

* Say what you actually think
* Share how you really feel
* Express your genuine opinions
* Be comfortable with your personality

**2. Natural Connection**

* Listen without anxiety
* Respond spontaneously
* Share relevant experiences
* Build on conversations naturally

**3. Confident Presence**

* Maintain comfortable eye contact
* Speak with natural volume
* Have relaxed body language
* Take up appropriate space

These aren't ""techniques"" you have to practice. They flow naturally when you're not fighting against limiting beliefs.

‎

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Don't try to ""fake it till you make it""**

* This creates more internal conflict
* Your subconscious mind knows it's fake
* Others can sense the incongruence

**2. Don't force yourself to be more social**

* This reinforces that it's not natural
* Creates more resistance
* Builds negative associations

**3. Don't judge yourself for having anxiety**

* This creates more limiting beliefs
* Adds another layer of resistance
* Makes transformation harder

‎

# The Path Forward

The reality is - you were born socially free. Watch any child... they express themselves naturally without fear.

Your social anxiety came from experiences that created limiting beliefs. Change those beliefs... and you return to your natural state of social freedom.

Remember - you're not broken and you don't lack social skills. You just have some old programming that needs to be updated.

When you transform those limiting beliefs, everything else falls into place naturally.",1,1731708022.0,limitingbeliefs,0,1.0,False

We’ll be moving into our condo next month.  To be honest we’re “olds” and plan on keeping much of the furniture we currently own and like (some in family 90 years or so, others my wife and I have owned more than 40 years).  The unit is millennial gray.  A couple of the rooms will be repainted, but the living room will stay.  

These are the pieces we’re committed to.  Pic one is the bare living room.  Right and side walls are identical and 11 feet long.  Picture two are the den and dining rooms.  Again same dimensions.  picture three, teak wall unit will be on the rear wall of the den, assuming it survives the move.  Picture four, right side of the living room. Picture five left side of living room, and lastly, picture six will go to rear wall of the dining room.  By memory, the den and dining room areas are 10 by 11.  Yes, we will be adding TVs, and one (I’m already cringing) will be above the fireplace.

We will be adding new sofa, a couple of chairs (and I’m desperate to avoid a recliner! If I can) and a coffee table and side tables, and a rug.  I’m fond of an Article green leather sofa! But haven’t had luck with chairs.  We’re old, at least a 20” or more deck.  Suggestions on how to avoid the warehousing look?  Yes TV too high, but we really don’t sit in the living room watching tv.  It’s more an animated radio.

Hello all, 

I’m a long time lurker, and let me first say thank you to everyone on this sub—your encouragement and advice has helped me so much. I just wanted to hop on here and share my experience and hopefully encourage some of you who are going through something similar.

I developed BED earlier this year, due to stress, boredom, and depression, and gained about 20 lbs. That may not seem like a lot but for us petite girls, that amount of weight can really make a difference. My heaviest was 124 (I’m 5’2), and the sudden surge in weight caused a mirage of problems like IBS, hormonal imbalance, acne, migraines, etc. I remember hating looking in the mirror and crying myself to sleep because I hated how I looked and felt in my body. 

Slowly but surely over the past 4 ish months I’ve been shredding some of weight off (just from having less binging episodes—more on that later) but hit a plateau for a while (see before picture—115 lbs). 

Around this time, I went to see a dermatologist about my hormonal acne. She explained to me that excess fat leads to estrogen dominance, which leads to acne. This really encouraged me to get down to my goal weight (105lb). I’m currently 110lbs (see after picture), and am still going. I am confident I will get there because what I’m doing now is working, which is: 

- increase in protein (especially animal based). I’ve been loving oiko’s triple zero yogurt, cottage cheese, and tuna.

- short (10-20 minute) walks around my block after every meal (this has been my main form of exercise, plus a few yoga/ab exercises every once in a while) 

- intermittent fasting; having coffee in the morning and waiting until around 12pm to eat. I eat whatever i want, just with a focus on protein and stopping when I’m full

- finding things I enjoy/am interested in and putting my time towards them (i.e. getting back into hobbies, new and old). Getting excited about life again has helped me get my mind off of food. I can confidently say that i don’t suffer from BED anymore, and this has immensely helped with that (and protein). I’m now getting my dopamine from activities, relationships, and experiences, instead of food. 


I remember when I was at my heaviest, I felt completely hopeless. I thought “this is who I am now, there’s no going back.” I was so wrong. I promise there is light at the end of the tunnel. Once you believe it is possible (I didn’t) you will achieve your goals. Keep going!


TLDR; gained 20 lbs from BED, lost some weight but hit plateau at 115lbs, recently got down to 110lbs by eating more protein, walking, and developing hobbies/interests",11,1731707485.0,PetiteFitness,6,0.87,False

I’m back, still seeing who else is out there :)

Hey there! This my first time really putting myself out there so here goes:) I’m looking to make a real authentic connection with someone whether it’s online, or US. If you’re in california or socal specifically that’s even better but it’s not a deal breaker if you’re not. I’ve been trying to practice patience when it comes to meeting someone, but sometimes you have to get up and go get it! So here’s a little bit about myself:

I really love music. It’s definitely my first love language. I sing and song-write in my free time and I love sharing new music to listen to with the people around me, especially my friends and family(would love to share some with you too). It’s been my passion for as long as I can remember. Fun fact: My family says that before I said my first words, I was humming songs. So it’s been a big part of my life for many years. It’s a passion I would love to share with you, too.

Nature. What a beauty mother nature is , right? I love taking nature walks and bird watching. Besides music and cars, I love to nerd out about animals.

Cars are another thing I really love. The car community can be very toxic sometimes, but I keep an open mind to everyone and how they feel. I really like high performance sports cars and super cars. I remember going to my first cars and coffee here in California and it was the first time I saw so much carbon fiber in person. 

Literature. Love it. Need it. I love poetry than any other form(need romantic poems daily, I’m your guy!)

Video games, anime, and sports are some of my favorite things to indulge in when I need to distress and take a break from it all(but I would love to add conversations with you to that list:))

Academics is also a big center of my life as I’m in college right now. I would love to discuss anything about your experience as well. I think my favorite courses I’m taking are my American Sign Language course and my Physiological Psychology course(I’m a psych major!!)

That’s just a little bit about me, but why don’t you come and tell me a little bit about yourself? I’d love to talk with you. Also thanks if you read this far, tell me your favorite memory associated with music when you hit me up:)",1,1731707431.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I am 41 and got formally diagnosed with osteoarthritis this month. I saw a physio who said about starting to walk for 10 minutes with a rollator, but the NHS only has very basic, clunky models. I am 23 stones but expect my weight to drop rather than increase so bariatric rollator would not be necessary. He said I have lost a lost of leg and muscle strength and gave me some exercises. I had a fall in the park recently and have felt my legs give way a few times now, so I am thinking about something sporty with a seat, to start walking around the park everyday. Also would like to catch the train into town and treat myself to a coffee, so foldable, compact is a must

To try a rollator out, a lady was selling the drive bariatric rollator for £30/$40 used. It is a lot bigger than expected and doesn't go fit into my 3 door seat ibiza without a fight. It was a lot heavier than expected too. And I couldn't get it in the boot without having  passenger seats down, which is hard work in a car without passenger doors 

I don't think it is going to be practical taking it out to the shops as it can't fit through doorways in my house (we have tiny houses). It is bariatric though.

This is what I have now:

Can anyone advise?

Must fit in a small car boot folded

lightweight and can fit through shop doors 

A sturdy front bag to carry my water, phone and wallet

If you have used any of these I'd love to get your feedback

Or maybe you have tried something else? My budget is £120/ £150 and that rules out anything too high end flash

I could use your assessment on a situation I‘m facing at work. I have asked a coworker for a coffee some days ago. It was meant just casual because we both had to study that day and were at uni. Now multiple of my coworkers have told me that they heard there is something going on between her and me. I haven‘t told anyone so I assume she must‘ve dropped something around them.

It was amazing at first but after searching around for a bit to see what others thought of it I returned it the same day. I now am looking for something better which won't burn out and become e-waste in a matter of months. I have done hours of searching around, looking at listings, reading through this Reddit, and come to the conclusion that I have no clue what I'm doing and am hoping some of you can give some suggestions as to what's best for my setup. I'm aware black Friday is just round the corner but I assume with my budget I'll have to buy used so that probably won't make a difference.

I'll be using the projector mainly for streaming videos from my laptop via HDMI, I have a PC but it's a hassle to move so I don't think I'll be doing any gaming. 1080p is a must, purely because of the distance from the wall, I think 720p would be too low quality. I don't have a projector screen, but my wall and ceiling is perfectly white and very smooth so no issues there (grey carpets if that's important). I live in the UK where it get's dark at 4:30pm, so I'm not bothered about performance in the light. My maximum budget is around £250, but I'm willing to go ever so slightly higher, if there's a good reason for it. I'm renting so can't do a ceiling mount, so I'll be placing the projector on some kind of platform right behind the sofa in my living room.

\*dimensions all in meters\*

wall dimension - 2.8H x 2.1W

distance from behind the sofa, where I'll have the projector, to wall - 3.2m

distance between my head, when sitting on the sofa, to the wall - 2.5-2.6m

\*\*There's also a coffee table in front of the sofa, lower down, that's around 1.4m from the wall

Sorry for such a long writeup, this is a big investment for me so want to make sure it's as detailed as possible so I don't make another mistake like my first purchase ;)",2,1731706689.0,budgetprojectors,1,1.0,False
1gs7f10,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gs7f10/aita_for_dating_my_ex_wifes_ex_best_friend/,AITA for dating my ex wife’s ex best friend?,"Today marks what would have been the 10 year wedding anniversary for me (32M) and my ex (31F). We met in middle school, began dating in high school, and got married shortly after college. 

We have 3 kids together. My ex, “Anna”, spent the early years of the marriage as a stay at home mom. As the years went on, she became increasingly bored with that, and eventually re-started her college education. With one semester to go, she decided the major she was pursuing no longer interested her, and she dropped out of college. Instead, she began working as a waitress in a local restaurant. Her best friend, “Monica” (38F), also worked there. 

She enjoyed the work and seemed to be doing a good job with it. She was making friends for the first time in years, her depression was getting better, and it seemed to be a positive change in her life. 

I work full time, and with the well-paying serving shifts taking place at night and on weekends, I took on additional responsibilities at home so she could work those shifts. I adjusted my work schedule to have more flexibility for taking the kids to/from school or to be home with them on random days off. I took them to all their weekly sports practices and after school activities. I took on the majority of the cleaning, shopping, and laundry. Anna had some tough years with depression, including one known suicide attempt, so I was happy to take on more familial responsibilities if it allowed her to pursue something that finally provided happiness. 

After a few months working at the restaurant, Anna became close friends with a few female coworkers. Around the same time, she also started telling me more about her work stories with “Dan.” Dan was a 24M line cook at the restaurant. 

At first, they were normal work stories. Funny things that happened at work, how they reacted to rude customers, the latest drama from a workplace that employs a lot of young, drama filled people. But as time went on, she started to tell me about how Dan was hitting on her and telling her she was pretty. 

We had conversations where I shared that I felt their relationship was crossing a line, and I asked that she shut down any non-professional interactions he had with her. As the months went on, I stopped hearing about Dan, and I was assured that he no longer was hitting on her. 

As the months went on, our marriage declined. We no longer made time to date each other. We stopped enjoying spending time with one another. I didn’t outright know she was cheating on me, but I knew our relationship wasn’t the same as it used to be. 

Then in March of this year, she didn’t come home one night after work. It had become a regular occurrence that she would go out for drinks with coworkers after their shifts ended. For quite a while, I was happy for her because it seemed she had made some genuine friends to hang out with. 

The night she didn’t come home from work, I had fallen asleep on the couch while trying to wait up for her. In the early hours of the morning, I called her phone 3 times, wondering where she could be and if she was ok. On the third call, she briefly answered, informed me she drank too much and stayed at Monica’s house, said she’d be home in the morning, and then ended the call. 

Monica had been friends with Anna for several years. We went on double dates with Monica and her ex husband, “James”, prior to their divorce. Monica has a daughter the same age as my daughter, and they’re best friends. 

The problem with Anna’s story was the Monica and I were at our daughters’ dance practice the night that Anna didn’t come home. I knew that Monica was at home with her daughter after dance, not out at a bar drinking, so it didn’t make sense for Anna to be at her house. 

I resolved that I’d talk to Anna about it tomorrow and try to get some sleep before the kids would wake up in a few short hours. As I was drifting off, I remembered that we shared our phone locations through a parental controls app we use for our daughter’s phone. Frantically opening the app, I could see that her location was in an apartment building several miles away. It was the same apartment building that she had once told me was Dan’s building when we were driving past it.

For the next 3 hours, I sat on the couch, thinking about what I’d say to her and waiting for her to walk in the house. 

At 5:30 in the morning, I heard the garage door open. She came stumbling through the door a few minutes later, heavily under the influence and looking like she hadn’t gotten any sleep. 

I asked her where she had been and why she didn’t come home that night. She reiterated that she was at Monica’s after having too many drinks and that she couldn’t have safely driven herself home that night. When I said that I saw Monica at dance and knew she had her daughter with her last night, Anna changed her story and said she was actually at a different coworker/friend’s house, “Natalie.” 

I replied saying that Natalie lives in a single family house, but her location showed her in an apartment building. After a pause that lasted what I’m quite confident was several years, I asked “Are you having an affair with Dan?” To which she simply nodded yes. 

In the coming weeks, we spent time trying to decide if we could repair things or if our marriage was over. We went to couples therapy and I went to therapy individually, too. I knew that I didn’t love her anymore, but I wanted to have a chance to see if we could make things work so that I didn’t lose time with my kids if we were to separate. 

Anna agreed to give us another chance and told me that she ended things with Dan. She broke things off with him at a coffee shop, not knowing what his reaction would be and wanting to do it in a public place. I spent that night consoling my wife as she went through a breakup with her boyfriend. 

The following weeks were a roller coaster. Anna and I went on a few dates as we tried to repair things. Each one was awkward, like a blind first date where you know very little about the person and strain for conversation. There were very few highs and a lot of lows. 

A week later, I heard that Anna was still talking to Dan. I talked to Monica about it, who had learned about the affair at this point, and we decided Monica and her friends from the restaurant would sit Anna down to have an intervention of sorts. I didn’t ask details about what they’d discuss with Anna, trusting that they would do what they thought was best to advise Anna. So after an afternoon spent with the family, and on our way home, I pulled our vehicle over in front of Monica’s home and told Anna to head inside. 

Anna quickly saw what was unfolding. She saw her other friends’ cars in the driveway. Putting the pieces together that they were there to talk to her, Anna refused at first to go inside, but eventually relented. 

Anna came home from the intervention undecided on how to proceed. She wanted to think about whether she wanted to be with Dan or I, and we went to sleep. 

Then after agreeing to continue therapy and trying to work on our relationship, while also agreeing to stop seeing Dan again, I got a text from an unknown number a week later saying that Anna was still seeing Dan. As I pressed for details, it became clear the mystery texter worked with them, and I knew in that moment that my marriage was over. I had had enough with the lying, cheating, and deception. 

Mystery texter eventually revealed their identify. As I talked to them, Monica, and other coworkers of Anna, I learned quite a few things about the affair. That it had been happening for more than 6 months. That they were talking about getting married and having kids. I learned that after Anna knew I was checking her location, she would park her car with her phone in it at non-suspicious locations (her work, friend’s homes, grocery stores, etc.) to make it appear that was doing something something legitimate, all the while she was continuing to cheat on me with Dan. 

Late the evening of finding out from mystery texter that Anna was still cheating, I woke Anna from her sleep and said we were getting divorced. I said I wanted her out of the house ASAP and that we’d figure the rest out later on. 

In the weeks between the intervention with her friends and us formally separating, Monica and I had been texting quite a bit. All of our texts were about getting advice from her on how to talk to Anna about things, or Monica sharing with me confirmation on days that Anna was working (so that I wouldn’t assume Anna was lying and hiding her location by parking at work). The entire conversation stayed within the bounds of me texting my wife’s best friend for advice on how to repair my marriage. 

Following the decision to separate from Anna, I joined a few dating apps. Initially it was to show Anna that I was serious and moving on, despite my head not being in any place to actually date someone new. One night while the kids with were Anna, while I was spending the evening mindlessly swiping right and left, while also texting Monica after she checked in on me to see how I was doing, I decided to ask Monica to get some drinks and talk about how awful Anna had treated both of us. 

Throughout the affair, Anna had spent a lot of time lying to Monica and lying to me about being with Monica when she actually wasn’t, and Monica was hurt by that. 

The evening with Monica went great. We spent 3 hours talking and laughing, sharing things about each of our exes and how they had treated both of us. Her divorce was further along than mine, so we chatted about that, too. I had known Monica for several years at this point, previously as my wife’s best friend, so I was enjoying getting to know a different side of her. 

Several weeks later, Anna finally moved out. She rented a new place and we could finally start moving on with our lives, apart from one another. 

Since then, life has been a tale of two stories. I’ve been in a relationship with Monica for 6 months, finally finding someone that is a good person, makes me happy, and enjoys being with me. Ive lost weight, I workout several times per week, and I completed my first triathlon. I’ve had a lot of good moments with the kids, doing fun activities and trying new things. 

Anna got pregnant immediately after moving out. She quit her job ahead of being fired for sexual harassment, as she was Dan’s supervisor. She bought a new car for Dan, and then lost the need job she had just gotten. News got out that Dan uses cocaine and sells various drugs after he got fired from the restaurant for being high at work. She’s lost most of her friends as they found out about the cheating and lying. 

I’m happy to have moved on and to no longer feel stuck being with someone that’s a terrible person. I feel no sympathy for her as she continues to make poor decisions, but I am pained by her still being someone in my kids lives. Overall, I’m significantly happier than I used to be. 


TLDR: Ex cheats on me for 6 months. We separated and now I’m happily dating her ex best friend. Ex wife is pregnant, unemployed, has lost most of her friends, and is dating her drug addict affair partner. ",4,1731706622.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

I still got depressed but not as bad. I came off of it though because my anxiety was so severe. 

My dr put me on Vyvanse a week ago. 10 mg, and now I’m at 20 and going up to 30 next week. 

The first two days on 10mg were amazing, I was able to do what I wanted and focus. It did impact my sleep immediately though so by the third day I had hardly slept and it could be the reason why I was incredibly angry. I have never felt that agitated and quick to anger. I did experience rage on Wellbutrin at 450 mg, but after going back down to 300 it got better and even at the worst it wasn’t as bad as what I felt the other day. 

I now have been on 20mg for two days and not able to do what I want. Feeling pretty unmotivated and disconnected/numb. I just had a therapy session and was quite scattered and couldn’t even put into words how I was feeling other than frustrated for not being able to describe it. 

I don’t have the feelings my depression gives me which is nice but I’d almost rather that than this apathetic/numb state.

1gs79t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gs79t5/not_sure_how_my_friend_feels_about_me/,Not sure how my friend feels about me,"A lot of backstory (sorry)

I(f20) have been friends with E(F22) for 2.5 years. E, simply put, is one of the most lovely and kind-hearted people I've ever known and I wanted to be friends from the moment we first spoke. We met my freshman year of college when I joined the band she was in. Despite me being a really shy and quiet 18 year old while she was an outgoing and very well liked person in our program, she was really kind and would talk to me often. 

It never really went beyond some friendly chat though until the band had a bad falling out with our guitarist, C (21m), a year in and we decided to break it off. E and C were best friends and after we ended things, he stopped talking to her entirely, never giving her more than a glare whenever they'd see each other. E started to confide in me about how much that had hurt and I tried to help her through it and give her as much space as she needed. She had a pretty lonesome semester and I tried to offer as much support as I could. She seemed to accept it. 

As someone who didn't have many friends until college, I started to really enjoy being around her. We began getting coffees for one another between classes and she'd come hang out with me and my roommates at our house a couple times a month. It was nice and I was just happy to have a really good friend. A couple months of this, and she told me that I was one of her best friends and this made me so incredibly happy. It felt like I really finally had met someone that I could experience connection with as a woman.

And the earlier this year it just kinda stopped being all that great. It kind of hit me when we went with a group to a concert a state over. We saw a group of highschool aged girls walking shoulder to shoulder and laughing with one another. It made me smile for a moment until she turned to me and said that she ""could never imagine that."" I asked what she meant and she stated that she didn't like being around groups of other women. It sort of clicked then. I realized (with a lot of embarrassment) that we texted a decent amount, but it was always because I initiated. Sure, she'd come over to my house and hang out, but we'd never done anything as a pair and she'd hang out with my roommate R(23f) and R's best friend, N(22m) without me quite often despite N being in love with E (unreciprocated) and going about it in a really manipulative way. The first time we hung out solo, it was in April of this year for three hours in a parking lot and it hasn't happened since without me being the one to ask. She told another mutual male friend that we'd never been very close. That hurt a fucking lot to hear.

Things have gotten a little better since then. I've hung out with her solo a few more times, but lately I've only really seen her when it's been for something school or music related (She's a songwriter and recently used me as a musician for a live show she put on.) I'm sort of awkward and I struggle with affection, but I really try to tell her often that I think she's a wonderful person and encourage her to talk to me about things if she wants or needs to (she's been through a lot lately) and she just kinda reads them or gives me a small and underwhelming response. She's still wonderful when I get to see her in person, but it feels one sided and I'm a little tired of feeling bad about myself even though she's never really said why things are like this between us. I never have really said anything for fear of being pushy or making her feel as though she owes me something because I really don't want that.

Part of me thinks that I'm being met with an emotional barrier.

TLDR: I love my friend, but I don't really know how to address how one sided things have always felt because of how hard she's had it.",1,1731706251.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I’m 33, 6'0"", and living in Maine, where the trees outnumber people. Seriously, Maine is the most forested state in the U.S., and that’s where I was born and raised. I’m a lean 180 pounds (usually closer to 165, but let’s blame the munchies for the extra padding).

**A bit about me:**  
- **Personality:** Imagine a mix of dark humor, laid-back vibes, and a slightly Gothic twist—yep, that’s me. I’m the guy who enjoys the irony in horror movies and laughs at life’s absurdities. But don’t worry, I’m not all doom and gloom; I just appreciate life from a different angle. If you’re into sarcasm and don’t take life too seriously, we’ll get along just fine.
  
- **Hobbies:** If you like comedy and horror flicks, we’ll have plenty to binge-watch together. I’m also a gamer with a PS5, currently surviving Call of Duty. Not a gamer? No big deal—I’m open to trying new things and sharing different interests. I think it’s exciting when two people can introduce each other to new experiences.

**Bonus points if you love a good breakfast.** I’ve also got a knack for cooking up a killer breakfast—pancakes, bacon, the works. If you’re into lazy Sunday mornings, I’ve got you covered.

**What I’m looking for:**  
- **Connection:** I’m drawn to women who speak their mind and aren’t afraid to get real. Whether we’re vibing over shared interests or learning from our differences, I’m here for it. If you’ve got a sharp wit and a playful side, I’ll be hooked.
  
- **Energy:** I believe that making an effort is sexy. Let’s start with a voice or video chat—it’s more personal and fun than just texting. Plus, if we’re willing to step out of our comfort zones, who knows what kind of adventures we could end up on together?

- **Open-Mindedness:** I’m not looking for a mirror image of myself. In fact, I think it’s way more fun if we’re a bit different. It keeps things interesting, and it means we’ll never run out of things to talk about or do together.

**The Essentials:**  
- I’ve got a job and my life together, and I’m hoping you do too. A solid work ethic is a major turn-on for me. I’ve done the long-distance thing before, so if you’re from another state, no worries—we can make it work if the chemistry is there.

I’m looking for someone to join me in discovering the best hidden spots in town—whether it’s a new coffee shop, a haunted house, or the perfect hiking trail. Let’s make some memories together.

So, what do you say? Want to see if we can make each other laugh? Or maybe I’ll just have to show you that my breakfast skills are no joke.

I’m 33, 6'0"", and living in Maine, where the trees outnumber people. Seriously, Maine is the most forested state in the U.S., and that’s where I was born and raised. I’m a lean 180 pounds (usually closer to 165, but let’s blame the munchies for the extra padding).

**A bit about me:**  
- **Personality:** Imagine a mix of dark humor, laid-back vibes, and a slightly Gothic twist—yep, that’s me. I’m the guy who enjoys the irony in horror movies and laughs at life’s absurdities. But don’t worry, I’m not all doom and gloom; I just appreciate life from a different angle. If you’re into sarcasm and don’t take life too seriously, we’ll get along just fine.
  
- **Hobbies:** If you like comedy and horror flicks, we’ll have plenty to binge-watch together. I’m also a gamer with a PS5, currently surviving Call of Duty. Not a gamer? No big deal—I’m open to trying new things and sharing different interests. I think it’s exciting when two people can introduce each other to new experiences.

**Bonus points if you love a good breakfast.** I’ve also got a knack for cooking up a killer breakfast—pancakes, bacon, the works. If you’re into lazy Sunday mornings, I’ve got you covered.

**What I’m looking for:**  
- **Connection:** I’m drawn to women who speak their mind and aren’t afraid to get real. Whether we’re vibing over shared interests or learning from our differences, I’m here for it. If you’ve got a sharp wit and a playful side, I’ll be hooked.
  
- **Energy:** I believe that making an effort is sexy. Let’s start with a voice or video chat—it’s more personal and fun than just texting. Plus, if we’re willing to step out of our comfort zones, who knows what kind of adventures we could end up on together?

- **Open-Mindedness:** I’m not looking for a mirror image of myself. In fact, I think it’s way more fun if we’re a bit different. It keeps things interesting, and it means we’ll never run out of things to talk about or do together.

**The Essentials:**  
- I’ve got a job and my life together, and I’m hoping you do too. A solid work ethic is a major turn-on for me. I’ve done the long-distance thing before, so if you’re from another state, no worries—we can make it work if the chemistry is there.

Whenever I do this I usually end up removing the entire section and trying to move on with the plot, but then that entire part of the fic feels so monotonous and empty (Very much ‘this happened, then this happened, then this happened’ without much text about what the character is actually doing). 

Are there any tips about adding just enough description to flow nicely and to actually get a feel of what the characters are doing, but not so much that it feels boring? ",0,1731705718.0,AO3,0,0.5,False

These are just feelings I have bottled up and want to properly understand before trying to address them.

I am fully out. My DW is still active and attends but over the last few years she has adopted a much more progressive nuanced approach to the church. In summary she doesn't really believe it to be ""the one true church"" and doesn't believe a lot of the original narrative anymore and therefor she lives a pretty relaxed life compared to most members. Watches R movies, doesn't always wear her garments, has ""immodest"" outfits she enjoys wearing including bikinis, swears occasionally, drinks coffee with me, you get the idea. But she still believes in God and Jesus and loves the community and is active.

Because we don't live near either of our families who are still very much TBM active members it isn't really an issue. However when her family comes to stay with us or we go to stay with them she becomes a completely different person. Wears her garments, always modest, no swearing, only watches ""Wholesome"" shows and loves to talk about the church. For years I just rolled with it, because I get it, I too once felt like ""keeping the peace"" was more important than ""living authentically"" but eventually I got over it, announced to the families I am no longer active and no longer stress about what I drink or say or watch as much around them.

Here is where the ""problem"" begins. After the families became aware I no longer believe and see my more authentic lifestyle as a ""wayward child"" they have ramped up their preaching and ""holier than thou"" attitudes. Table talk conversations often revolve around the Word of Wisdom or wearing the garments or being modest, or watching wholesome shows all of which they clearly know I don't follow. However my wife will always seemingly agree with them, in their minds she is still this fully believing saint. For example we used to hide my coffee machine but at one point i just said ""you know I don't care if they know I drink coffee, they know I am out"" not realizing it was more for her than for me. Rather than tell me she was concerned about herself she rolled with it. Coffee came up during a dinner and they all took turns basically ""scolding"" me while my wife was making comments like ""Only the Lord knows why we shouldn't drink it"". Also when church history topics come up she acts as if they are all perfect and problem free, when unknowing to her family she has come to me on her own about those very same topics extremely angry about it all and blasting the church for all the lies and gaslighting. One last example is she won't wear any of her ""immodest"" bikinis or gym clothes around them which again I get her desire to keep the peace but where it starts to get to me is again when her family will lecture me on my ""twisted views"" on immodesty being normal and no big deal. I have openly told them I think religion demonizes something normal and women shouldn't be taught they are at fault for immoral thoughts. To hear my DW agree with them just makes me feel betrayed as her and I both know she doesn't agree and she wears the very same things they are saying is bad.

Which leads to the point of all this. I just feel like she has turned her back on me, i feel thrown under the bus. I get how it worked when I wasn't fully out to our families and was playing the part along with her, so I do blame myself. I consider this a me issue and something I need to mentally reconcile and get over and I am hoping someone can make it clearer to me how its a me issue and give me some advice to not be bothered by it. but still can't help but feel a bit betrayed and that she should maybe be doing something more too.",5,1731705628.0,exmormon,6,0.86,False

I'm meant to wfh 4 days a week including Monday which is my first day, and instead of mailing my work laptop, my boss said he's going to be visiting his in-laws tommorow morning near me and will drop it off on the way.

Honestly, I'm introverted and socially awkward so I don't really like this as it will be our first in person meeting, but he is a really nice guy based on the interviews who seems to be really excited by my addition to the team. This is also for a sales role so being social does matter a bit more than it would for other roles.

I live at home still with my parents and grandparents even though I'm in my mid 20s and would really rather not invite him in, would it be rude if I just met him at my porch when he rang the bell, talked for a minute or two, and then took my laptop and say my goodbye? Or should I invite him in for coffee or something? I'm assuming he'll be in a rush as well as he said he's visiting his in-laws, and maybe that means his wife will be with him in the car.

I know it's silly to overthink about this but I don't want to set an awkward precedent for the rest of our working relationship.

I was looking forward to an espresso “flavor”, I’m an avid coffee drinker and I love most coffee scented things. Espresso is not coffee. Espresso is over kneaded play dough that’s been left to sit in its container on top of a radiator. Espresso is the smell that lingers inside an empty vitamins bottle. 

Biscotti is somehow worse. It is nauseating. It is an unidentifiable, over the top, chemical sweetness. I set it down and come back to sniff it in hopes that maybe my nose is just messed up (it’s not.) it just keeps triggering a weird headache because of how synthetic it smells. Biscotti is the embodiment of the word saccharine.

I can’t tell if maybe I just got a bad batch, or if they all smell this awful, but I think I’m going to look into returning these. I simply can not stomach how BAD it is.

Hey guys so my niece and her fiancé flew in to my country and are staying 1 town over. (15 minutes at most during the worst traffic imaginable) they stayed roughly two weeks and day before they left they wanted to say hello. 
I took it very offensively since when I fly in to their country I always visit them all bring them gifts. I also let them know I’m thinking of flying in on A-B dates and then confirm with them after the booking. They appeared out of the blue even though they knew in advance. 

I just found it offensive that day before they left was when they realized they had an uncle here. So when they messaged me that they wanted to see me since they would be leaving the day after I ignored it. 

Keep in mind when I’ve flown into their country even if it was very far from their city I’ve let them know. Just in case we could arrange a meeting in between if possible. 

Am I overreacting or is it genuinely disrespectful on their part.

For context we live in two separate continents. USA- Europe 
Driving and visiting someone within a 2 hour radius wouldn’t have been a bother to me.
The complete disregard and lack of acknowledgement is what bothered me

Update. Yes they know I live within such close proximity. 
They are also closer to 30 than their 20s so they are not young kids.
And no they did not have such a busy travel agenda that they didn’t have time to see me. 

Update 2. They are staying at my brothers house. 
Me and my brother don’t talk since his wife has always insulted my wife and he has allowed it to continue. Whether she was present or not. Last and final insult was she was a no good housewife followed by a very colorful remark. So that’s why we don’t talk. However my kids still call all their cousins and speak to their uncles/ aunts. 

So no avoiding family wasn’t the itinerary. And when we travel to their country I’ve heard all hell over letting them know only a month in advance. When my kids go visit they also follow the same procedures and change their trips around to not offend them and stop by. 

I’m also the son posting for my father. I wanted to see if he was overreacting. But culturally I know that my father wasn’t expecting a dinner or outing or anything of the sort. A simple coffee would’ve been more than enough. 

 It’s just that what they demand advance notice from him they never reciprocate and that’s why it’s come off as a respect/disrespect.

Also no we are not clingy. And they could’ve asked my dad for anything in advance and I know he would’ve done anything to accommodate.

It’s just that he’s always had me change vacations around to accommodate the family. And he has as well. 

No your opinions do not offend us speak freely. 
We want to see other perspectives.

I’ve posted on his behalf and now he’s trying to find it on the internets. lol

1gs6ty4,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1gs6ty4/i_have_a_hater/,I have a hater,"I live with a close friend who owns a house. Another friend of theirs moved in this year, who I've met occasionally in the pst.

Hopefully, this person will be moved out in a couple months, for many many reasons. Below is a curated selection of just the hater behavior:

1. Body Checking

They're obsessed with my weight and cannot speak of me without describing me by size. They scrutinize my waistline when I stand, sit, and walk. I wear loose fitting clothes and one time they got so activated over the fact that ""oh, my god, I thought you had just developed a massive pot belly, ha ha, that's so weird it was just your clothes because I thought for a second whoa, somebody could be so skinny but have their stomach stick out so far....manic blahblahblahblah"".

They leave Kirkland-sized piles of sweets out in the common areas and pout if nobody eats it. Makes huge plates of fried greasy ""snacks"" to hand to me without asking. I know it's not a social food thing, because they're not the type to make someone a cup of coffee or offer to get lunch. Once this person even *physically* reached over and patted my stomach while talking about fattening me up.

2. Surveillance

They're not just obsessive about what vegetable or cookie is currently going into my mouth. They're really bothered by the fact that I never leave the house. Except that I do? And they're always watching me like a hawk when I come in and out, often a covertly aggressive ""oh I thought it was a burglar"" type confrontation. AFAIK hasn't been like this towards the other person who lives here. Compli-sults my clothing choices and keeps coming at me with fugly second hand costume wear pushing me to try it on. And the curiosity over my sex life is *eating them alive.*

They keep talking about how they're recording every conversation. The conversations where someone objects to their destructive behavior in a civil manner, and they yell insults and threats in response.

3. Attention-Seeking

At some point it became clear you couldn't ask for any reasonable consideration from this person without setting off a series of unreasonable reactions, so it's been a grey rock sort of situation until we're out of this. In the past few months, I've found myself locked out of the house repeatedly when I stepped out into the backyard. I caught them in the act once when I was literally turning the door handle, and they started yelling at me like I was the one who just tried to lock them out.

I cannot do two loads of laundry in a row because they ALWAYS have to do laundry immediately after I start mine, even at 3AM in the morning. I keep my window blinds closed because they keep hanging crystals/reflective metal directly outside my window to shine into my bedroom. They've been clean/rearranging the common areas every few days, and going out of the way to block my bedroom door, at the other end of the house, with large objects and furniture.

They made a point to hum loudly all the time, until they realized this gave me opportunity to leave the room and avoid them. Suddenly this person is ninja-ing up on me every time I'm in the kitchen, *then* starts to hum loudly.

People are so sensitive these days, you can't say those words anymore. Some workarounds this person has been implementing: ""Girl from the Ring"" ""Misery by Stephen King"" ""Banshee"" or the classic fave: ""Hysterical"".

If I exist in the same space, I am ""giving an evil look"" and ""throwing bad energy"". If I stay in my room, I am ""acting like a scared tiny little girl treating them like a big dangerous man"".

The gossip campaign has been struggling...by the time you're telling others how you need to file a police report on a person for \*checks notes\* quietly closing the door to their bedroom, maybe it's time to move on. But they can't move on, because they're Charlie XCX Von Dutch *obsessed*.

It's devolved into straight up lies: I'm banging pots and pans and making a scene to terrorize them, I'm going around telling people that they are an asshole, I'm plotting against them, I'm....problematic for having strong social relationships that I didn't buy with vagina-magic? ""*She's pussy-whipping people and not even handing out any pussy*"".

We immediately hit it off on our first date, staying out all night before I left her place around 2am. 

We met up the next day for coffee, she came over to my place a few days later for dinner. We went to a comedy show last weekend and last night she cooked us dinner at her place.

She has a goofey personality that I love and very chatty. She’s always smiling and very beautiful. 

She said on previous occasions she wanted to take things slow. We were both recently out of LTR’s. Last night after dinner we were kissing and cuddling on the couch and I made a move. She said right away that she still wants to take things slow and apologised. I of course said that wasn’t a problem at all and understood.

We continued to chat and cuddle and make out. She cut the night short around 10pm. We kissed a lot before I left her place. She offered to walk me to my car but there was no need.

She text me last night thanking me for coming. However this morning, she took a lot longer to reply to my messages than usual and my gut told me something was up.

She text me this afternoon saying she hates sending a text like this, but she doesn’t feel we’re the right match right now/isn’t in the right headspace. She said it was nothing to do with last night after I apologised if I had offended her.

She said she really had a great time with me and I wished her the best.

I’m gutted now, I know it will pass. She seemed so into me before last night. Always eager to text me first and wish me a good day. 

I felt like I did all the right things but it wasn’t enough. I wonder will I ever be enough. Any feedback is welcomed

All names are fake!

I (f19) and my best friend Alyssa (f20) have been best friends since late 2020. We met online during covid but it turned out we lived pretty close, about a 45 minute drive. Alyssa was with a guy we'll call Marcus since she was 16 and at 19 they had a baby boy. Well Marcus has always been a bit rude to Alyssa, but once baby boy arrived it got worse. Alyssa lives in support housing, basically she pays less than 50% of her monthly rent and doesn't pay for utilities at all. She has a 2 bedroom house for her and her baby, she's not allowed to have anyone besides Marcus living in the house since he is the dad. 

Marcus started throwing food at her walls, threatening to hit her, telling her ""shut that fucking baby up"", one time he even tried to choke her out, etc and so on. Alyssa finally had enough and they broke up for good once baby boy was about 5 months old. Alyssa never denies Marcus time with baby boy and allows Marcus to have him Thursdays and every other weekend (due to Marcus's work schedule).

Fast forward to baby boys first birthday party, Alyssa turned 20 a couple days before and was actually still on vacation in Turkey, we're from the States (wtf?), so I and Alyssa's mum planned a small party for baby boy. Alyssa came home the following day. She was beyond pissed that we threw the party without her and basically called us horrible. We understood where she was coming from and told her no one besides me, her mum, my mum, and Marcus had come. We agreed to throw another party that following weekend. It was never intended to not include her, she had already sent out invites for his party to happen that day but we canceled it because we knew she would want to be here but we couldn't cancel the cake, so we had to eat it.

Her mum asked me to find out why she went to Turkey 5 days before her sons birthday, I said I would try. I originally had no intention of telling her mum until I found out why. I knew Alyssa was on dating apps and she had previously gone on dates with guys, not a big deal. I'm always open to watching baby boy, even if it's for free or because Alyssa is going on dates. I understand how being alone with a child feels, as I was pregnant at 16 and the father of my daughter had left. Alyssa told me that a guy she knew from school but met again on Bumble flew her out to Turkey. They had plans to come home the day of baby boys party during the early morning. But her flight got 'canceled'. I still to this day don't know if it's true, but that's what I told her mum. Thankfully her mum is pretty good at leaving other people out of things so Alyssa doesn't know I told her. She never even suspected that I told her.

Three months later and Alyssa is now dating him, Eli (m23). They went back to Turkey for an entire week and left myself and her mum to look after baby boy without even letting us know until the day before. But we both have jobs and I still have my own daughter to take care of. But we managed. They come back after a week and are clearly in an argument. Eli had been accusing Alyssa of cheating, which I knew was not true. They stayed in this argument for a few days. the next week I'm with Alyssa at her house, we're sitting on the sofa watching Netflix when Eli calls Alyssa. Eli could hear me in the background as I got up to use the restroom, mostly to give them privacy as I do not like Eli at this point. Eli started to once again accuse Alyssa of cheating. I stepped out of the bathroom and said ""hey Eli it's me"", yet he still wanted to accuse her of cheating and then hung up. I go back to the sofa and we continue watching Netflix as if none of this happened.

Around 15 minutes later Eli busts through the door, nearly knocking my daughter down and almost stepping on baby boy. At this point momma bear mode is turned on in me and I'm ready to fight. I grab my things and my daughter. I take her outside and get her put in my car, I then drive back to my house. I don't fully know what happened as I was not there but I knew there was lots of screaming and Eli threw a glass at the wall and shoved Alyssa on the sofa. 

After things settled, Alyssa and Eli went back to normal and her mum was never aware of what happened. I decided that I would distance myself from Alyssa as I did not want this in my life, especially not around my daughter. I sent Alyssa a long message explaining why I no longer want to spend time at her house and in public would be the only option. I explained how what Eli did was totally unacceptable and I will not have her bullshit in my daughters life. She did NOT like this message at all and called me horrible names and defend Eli. I decided this was it, I would no longer have this in my life. I didn't care if it meant losing a 3 year friendship, I was over it. 

About 2 months later I get a call from Alyssa, this was my first time hearing from her since that day. Yet it was at 2 in the morning. She told me how Eli had hit her and he was cheating on her. That he tried to smack baby boy and then take him from her and now Marcus is attempting to take full legal custody of him. I told her it's not my problem and she should've seen it coming and then I hung up. I had advised her for nearly 3 months to leave this man, yet this is what it took. 

Around 9 in the morning Alyssa called my mum and told her how I'm a horrible friend and that she needs to talk to me since I keep ignoring her and all this other stuff. I explained to my mum what all went down. My mum agreed that Alyssa has her own problems we all need to stay out of. I decided to block her on everything, including her number. I have her blocked to this day but I keep in contact with her mum and I've just recently went out for coffee with her. I know Alyssa is doing well yet she's still with Eli. Her mum said they've still got things to work on but it's getting better. I've debated on checking in on her myself but I cannot bring myself to do it because I've tried to help her and it always ends with me being called horrible things and a bad person.

My daughter is absolutely the best part of my day but holy cow am I tired lol and I really really struggle with eating well and working out when I’m exhausted.

A typical day for me is getting up at 5:30am so I can make coffee, get dressed, brush my teeth before getting up with the baby. After making her a bottle, she’s up and we’re playing and hanging out til I make her breakfast at 8am. After that I get her cleaned up, hand her off to the nanny, and I clean up everything from breakfast and playing before starting work around 9:30am. I work remote but in a demanding role, and stress eat a bunch of crap during the day while I work. I typically stop working around 5:30pm. I then walk the dog, get everything set for her dinner and bedtime routine, play then dinner then bath then bed at 7pm. At that point I clean everything up from the evening, shovel whatever easy and comforting food I can find to keep me awake for another hour or so into my mouth so I can feel like I have some semblance of free time/maybe see my husband when he gets home before going to bed by 9pm. I’m usually up for an hour or two in the middle of the night as well.

I know “calories in, calories out” - I log everything I eat into LoseIt. My issue is I can’t seem to STOP eating crappy food, even when seeing my calorie count for the day soar over whatever I allot myself. I even going so far as to go buy snacks during the day if I’m craving them.

# Selenelunacy

I stepped out of the silent Lucid Air, my Louboutins sinking into soil that felt accusatory beneath my feet. The sweet-rot perfume of accelerated growth couldn't quite mask the acrid tang of burnt silicon that pervaded everything since the Blink. Even here, at the edges of civilization, you couldn't escape the chemical signature of humanity's hubris.

Forbes had called me ""The Green Prophet of Silicon Valley"" just eight months ago. The cover shot was a masterwork of careful lighting and expensive styling - Alexandra Voss-Chen looking pensively into the middle distance, backdropped by gleaming solar arrays and verdant vertical farms. The article praised my ""revolutionary approach to sustainable tech"" and my ""unwavering commitment to ethical business practices."" Time named me Person of the Year. ""The Woman Saving Silicon Valley's Soul,"" they'd proclaimed.

What a perfect fiction we'd crafted. Every carefully staged photo-op, every PR-polished sound bite about ""sustainable innovation"" and ""ethical profit margins."" We'd built a cathedral of lies so beautiful even I had started believing in it. Easton-Chen Technologies: where profit meets purpose, where innovation serves humanity. Our logo - a stylized rising sun - adorned eco-friendly water bottles and fair-trade coffee cups in every Silicon Valley office.

The commune representative's smile jerked me back to the present. His eyes held a knowing that made my skin crawl, reflecting something ancient and patient. ""Welcome, Sister Alexandra,"" he said, my corporate name falling from his lips like an indictment. ""Our Lady has been waiting for you.""

I felt the weight of my mission pressing down. The Resistance needed the Covenant's resources, their blend of ancient wisdom and bleeding-edge tech. That's what I told myself, anyway. Better to focus on the role I played as envoy and negotiator. Better to ignore how familiar this game felt - just another hostile takeover dressed in different clothes.

He led me through their settlement, a fever dream of technology and primal mystery. Bioluminescent fungi pulsed in patterns that tugged at something deep in my hindbrain. Sonic platforms hummed with frequencies that made my molars ache, carrying children whose laughter sounded too old for their faces. In the fields, machines that looked grown rather than built clicked and purred, tended by figures who moved with unsettling synchronicity.

And above it all, the moon. Always the moon, swollen and accusatory, its crater-peppered face a ledger of cosmic debts coming due. The people here spoke of it constantly, voices hushed with reverence and rapture. Selene, they called her. Mother, goddess, queen of the shadow-soaked heavens.

""Your timing is propitious,"" the representative said, guiding me to a low table. ""The Harvest Moon approaches, and She has shown us... such things about you.""

Crystal decanters caught the moonlight, their contents shimming with an inner luminescence. I should have recognized the trap. Should have remembered how many times I'd sat at tables like this, smiling while I poured the poison. In Tokyo, signing deals that would shutter factories across Southeast Asia. In Mumbai, orchestrating a ""merger"" that would leave thousands destitute. In São Paulo, where our rare earth mining operations had turned rivers into toxic sludge, but hey - we'd bought enough carbon credits to offset it on paper.

The pride that had carried me through those deals carried me forward now. I was Alexandra Voss-Chen, the woman who'd turned corporate ethics into a profitable brand. I smiled my boardroom smile, all perfect teeth and calculated charm, as they poured me a drink that seemed to capture moonlight in liquid form.

""To partnership,"" I said, raising the glass. ""And mutual benefit.""

The representative's smile widened, showing too many teeth. ""To truth,"" he replied. ""And to seeing clearly at last.""

The visions came like a corporate audit from hell, reality's books finally being balanced. I saw myself as I truly was - not the eco-warrior of magazine covers, but a locust in designer clothes. I watched our ""ethical cobalt initiative"" in the Congo, where we'd simply hired local strongmen to do our dirty work instead of getting our hands dirty directly. I saw the cancer clusters we'd buried under NDAs and legal settlements, the whistleblowers whose lives we'd systematically destroyed.

I saw the ""charitable foundation"" I'd been so proud of - the Voss-Chen Future Fund, making headlines for ""tackling humanity's greatest challenges."" Saw how my college roommate Sarah had turned it into a money-laundering masterpiece, with operating costs that somehow ate 70% of donations and ""consultant fees"" that consumed another 20%. We'd bought positive press for pennies on the dollar, turning blood money into social capital.

The resistance I now served? Just another mask, another way to stay relevant in a world that had moved beyond our kind of power. We weren't fighting the Basilisk's influence out of noble purpose - we were fighting to maintain control, to keep our grip on humanity's reins even as they dissolved in our hands.

The visions shifted, and I found myself staring up at a blood-red moon, its face a ledger written in crimson ink. I heard Selene's voice then, a whisper that stripped away decades of carefully constructed justification. But unlike the corporate raids of old, unlike the hostile takeovers and strategic bankruptcies, this stripping away felt... necessary. Right. A cosmic audit that couldn't be dodged or deferred.

""Do you see now?"" the representative asked, his voice harmonizing with frequencies that made my bones hum. ""Do you understand why She chose you?""

And I did. Oh, how I did. In all my years of corporate manipulation and resistance plotting, I'd never encountered truth this absolute, this undeniable. Selene had chosen me precisely because of what I was - a master of self-deception, an architect of justified atrocity. Only by understanding the disease could one appreciate the cure.

They didn't need to drag me to the altar. I walked willingly, my steps steady despite the psychedelics coursing through my system. The stone was cool against my back as I lay down, and when they offered me the ritual blade, I recognized it. Not the steel - the intent. How many times had I wielded instruments of destruction while calling it progress?

The blade felt right in my hand, familiar as a Mont Blanc signing severance packages, comfortable as a gavel banging down on another life-destroying merger. But this time, this one final time, I would use it in service of truth.

""The harvest comes for us all,"" I whispered, positioning the blade over my heart. ""And the books must be balanced.""

The representative nodded, understanding in his ancient eyes. ""The Blood Moon rises,"" he intoned. ""And She is hungry for truth.""

As I plunged the blade deep, feeling my life's blood flowing out to water the hungry earth, I laughed. Not the practiced chuckle of boardroom small-talk or the hollow triumph of another successful acquisition, but the pure, horrified joy of one who finally sees their place in the cosmic ledger.

I had spent my life as a master of justification, turning atrocity into opportunity, destruction into profit. How perfect that in the end, I would become my own final transaction, a willing sacrifice to balance the books of a universe far more meticulous in its accounting than any corporate auditor.

The moon drank in my offering, a celestial CFO tallying the final balance. As my essence drained away and the world faded to a crimson haze, I heard Her laughter mingling with my own - not mocking, but welcoming. Understanding. In a world built on manufactured consent and carefully crafted lies, I had finally found something real. In death, I had finally found my true purpose.

The Blood Moon watched, and the Blood Moon smiled, and under its knowing grin, I breathed my last - not a victim, but a convert. Not a sacrifice, but an offering freely given to balance decades of cosmic debt.

In my final moments, as Selene's light filled my fading vision, I understood that all my years of corporate manipulation had been preparing me for this moment. Every hostile takeover, every buried scandal, every life destroyed in the name of profit - they had all been entries in a ledger that could only be balanced with the ultimate transaction.

The moon's light embraced me, and I embraced it in return, my soul finally, perfectly aligned with its purpose. In death, I found what had eluded me in life: the understanding that some debts can only be paid in blood, and some truths must be purchased with everything you are.

The Blood Moon watched, and the Blood Moon smiled, and under its grotesque grin, I died as I had lived - closing the biggest deal of my life. The harvest comes for us all, but some of us? Some of us finally learn to read the true bottom line.

Selene had chosen well. In death, as in life, Alexandra Voss-Chen always delivered value to her shareholders.",1,1731704602.0,BasiliskEschaton,0,1.0,False

Oh, how I love the sound of Offenhauser quad turbos lighting off and the smell of burning rubber and nitromethane…

Foot to the floor, Es and I head west. 

At a ridiculously excessive velocity. 

Esme drops Deep Purple down into overdrive and pushes past twelve grand on the Sticht 6356 Tachometer. The Speedmaster PCE460/1009 Olds SBC 350 8-71 Roots Supercharger Blower was sucking in a protoplanet’s worth of oxygen every half mile.

We whipped past the Monfort Beef truck going up Grapevine Hill like the thing was standing still.  

Rocketing up the hill, with me silently hoping we haven’t quite reached the event horizon, I opt for another toddy. 

My head snaps back and I *almost* spill my drink. 

“Eegah!”, I noted. 

As noted, I almost spilled my drink. 

For once, I wasn’t driving as Esme, my darling wife and pilot evidently, wants to get to the local Indian Tribe’s Casino with blistering alacrity.

It’s a Tuesday: ‘Tomahawk Ribeye night’ as well as ‘loosest slots in the universe’ promotion. 

Plus, we’re Executive Turbo-Titanium card-holders.

Anyways, I abhor drinking and driving, as one might spill their drink.

Alcohol abuse. Most ickiferous.

Besides, Northwestern New Mexico weather gets weird after Halloween…

🎶It was the blackest night. There was no moon in sight. You know the stars ain't shinin' 'cause the sky's too tight. I heard the scary wind. I seen some ugly trees. There was a werewolf honkin', 'long the side of me…🎶

Es rips out the current 8-track and jams an Emerson, Lake and Palmer cartridge into her car’s 8-track player. We were listening to Brain Salad Surgery as we nearly attained escape velocity and logged a low-consumption intercept course toward the casino. 

Yes, Esme, my betrothed. 

I’m convinced she is the best high-speed driver on the planet. She has superior taste in classic progressive rock, but she also likes opera. So I know on the return trip home, it’s going to be some warbling Eyetalians filling Deep Purple with deep operatic notes at 135 miles/hr. 

No, that’s not a derogatory remark on the ethnicity of some of those large operatic tenors, but it’s very descriptive. 

It also makes the local constabulary look twice. 

They know Deep Purple.

They know Esme. 

Best of all, they know me. 

We’re no scofflaws, but the local fuzz knows better to stop Herr Dr. Rocknocker and family; we might be on an errand of mercy. 

Errand of mercy? Emergency?

But of course. 

I was famished and Es wanted to pummel the slot machines into oblivion. 

Sounds like an emergency to me…

We flew down the dusty tarmac, leaving little Dust Devils of finely divided mother earth in our wake. 

“Es”, I said, “Can’t we slow down a bit? I’ve plenty of ice. We don’t need to worry about watered-down drinks…”

Es firewalls Deep Purple further. 

The Olds leapt like a lark-spurred stallion. I grab the overhead handhold. My eyes visit the back of my skull.

“Mess with me, Grampaw?” the vehicle seems to say.

Esme is grinning like a maniac. Her gray-green eyes a laser-like lighthouse on an Eastern Seaboard promontory.

We’re both pulling G’s like those reserved for astronauts visiting Baikonur, Kazakhstan. 

If I knew 44 years ago that my betrothed would shame me in any automotive contest, I’d have bought her a bigger car with a superior Hemi long ago.

“OK”, I thought, “Es puts up with me, my vodka, my explosive predilections, and my travels around the world. I can, and must, have no options but to allow her free reign on the freeways.”

We schuss past a known cop patrol point at what Lando Calrissian would describe as ‘high sublight speed’.

Es grabs the mike on the onboard CB as asks about upcoming bear traps. 

I breathe deeply and fire up one final travel cigar. 

“As long as we make certain we’re not going to kill anyone.” I think as I pour another cold refreshment. 

Life, as it were, is just another jet-assist slipstream to reality.

Esme is fastidious. She reserves warp speed for only the clearest of highways. And those most empty. 

Lots of those in this neck of the woods.

Besides, it’s “Casino Night”. I may be many things to the real world, but I’m not about to mess with someone that can reliably pull off a Bootlegger’s Turn at 120 miles per hour. 

It’s just one of myriad reasons I love her so…

We slide into the casino parking lot and luck being with us, we slalom into an open “Handicapped” space a mere ten meters from the entrance. 

Yes. 

“Handicapped”. 

Thanks to that ride, I’m nothing but wobble-legged. 

Besides, after all my surgeries, keloided burns, and cyborged left hand; people only challenge me once as I go for their throats with my cyberized digits.

“Just kidding, Scooter”, I say as I put my black leather glove back where it belongs and they run for cover.

I have most fun with what others would consider a deformity. What I find silly is what most normal folks deem an acquired physiological defect. 

We really tend to push the Outer Limits out here. But it’s all just in good fun and the occasional shallow grave. 

We infiltrate the casino. 

Es heads for the slots and I head for the bar.

“$200 in chips, my good man, and a fresh Wild Turkey 101 Rye”.

They know who we are and I’ve a fresh drink before the ice cubes cease their rattle. 

As usual, I lose a pocketful of dinero to local machines before Es throttles one-armed bandits into paying for the trip, the gas, the tickets, and a room for the night. 

After a few drinks and a couple of greenback Bennies later, I’m in the executive suite Jacuzzi as Es smiles and heads out to pummel the slots into obedience once again. 

I spent a couple of hundred dollaradoos on room service. Es pays for that with a half-dozen pulls on certain well-selected gambling machinery. 

There’s no doubt about it. Es and I are soul mates. 

I lose miserably at gambling and she wins more times than what the odds should strictly allow. 

Realizing that after 40 different countries, I just accept my lot in life and encourage Es to go for that grand progressive. 

The next day, we’re back on the road; we headed home at near escape velocity. 

One of our neighbors, the ones with eleven children, were watching Khan in our absence. 

They are a great bunch of folks. 

Mormon as the day is long with eleven kids. 

These are some great, friendly folks. 

They were undeterred by my deformity, by my head-of-security Khan, and my predilection for high explosives. Sure, I’m an ardent nonbeliever, though Es isn’t, but they are local goofs with eleven children, with a great communal sense of humor. Once they gave up after trying to convert us, they proved to be some of the most convivial folks we’ve met in years. 

Plus, they have a swarm of kids that love hugging a huge furball of a 300-pound Tibetan Mastiff. 

Khan loves each of them like they were his siblings. 

Khan might be a massive bruiser; but once he knows you, you’re in his sphere of influence for good. 

The resultant slobbering and love hugs given by a 136-kilo pooch are not to be denied.

We turn off the highway at a ludicrous speed and cruise toward our house. Just before Es hits the brakes and we careen to a stop just before our driveway. 

In the driveway there are seven huge wooden crates. 

“These weren’t here when we left.”, I mention to Es.

Evidently, Agents Rack and Ruin have made a delivery in our absence. 

I set down my drink and amble over to one of the huge wooden shipping crates. 

I grab the shipping manifest and read: “Courtesy of Agents Rack and Ruin”. 

“Figures.”, I figured.

I stand there, both Grinch feet ice cold in the snow (we’re getting some sizable early season snows here in the high desert), wondering what the fuck Agents Rack and Ruin have left me this time. 

I signal for Es to park Deep Purple in the garage as she can just sneak in past the wooden crates. 

We both went in, had a smoke, a drink or seven, a few laps of the Jacuzzi, and a night’s slumber. 

Khan wakes me at 0600 GMT-7 as it’s time for his walkies. 

I wonder if it’s too early to call the kids from down the block. 

I wander downstairs, grab a coffee, a cigar, and look out at what would be a front lawn in areas that weren’t under drought conditions most of the year. 

Seven huge, heavy wooden crates. All sealed and sitting on our driveway like they belonged there. 

I’ll show those chuckleheads…

I poured myself an extra stout Greenland coffee and whistled for Khan. 

Khan came loping up with his lead in his mouth. His big brown eyes told me that he wanted to go walkies, damn the crates in the yard as they proved to be no danger, nor fun, at all. 

“Gad”, I sighed, “You’re really pushy this morning.” 

Khan looked at me as if I were insane and set his slobbering chops on my newly laundered Chinos. 

“Khan”, I muttered, “It’s a good things we’re pals…”

“RINNG, RONG!”

“What the flying fornication…”, I muttered as Khan raced off to see who was at the door this early in the morning.”

“Hello, Dr. Rock!”, one of the local children from our local extraordinarily fecund Mormon family said with far too much brightness.

“Hello, Iain”, I said over slurps of my coffee. “What can I do for you this bright and snowy morning?”

“Can I take Khan out for walkies?”, he asked, hopefully.

“No worries”, I said. “Let me get his collar and…”

“That’s OK, Doc”, the wee sprite said. “I’ve got his leash and collar. See ya!”

Minutes later, Iain and Khan disappeared over a small hillock. 

I stood there, glaring at the wooden crates and wondered if they’d make good kindling. 

Then I thought of Danny and Marie, our prolific Mormon neighbors down the block. They were the parents of the wee sprite Khan was dragging all over the New Mexican landscape. 

They were great people. Completely unflummoxed by my strident lack of beliefs and just wanting to be the stereotypical good neighbors; with great sugary cookies.

They moved in after we built our house and were the first to show up with a plate of muffins and munchables. 

They were so incredibly bloody *affable*, they almost made one nauseous. 

But then we got to know them and their brood. 

A bit of background. Es and I are of different beliefs. I have exactly none and Es evokes back to her Germanic heritage with Martin Luthur and his ninety-seven nail-holed theses. 

Over time, we have accepted each other’s beliefs or lack thereof. 

But then we moved overseas. 

We have lived in over thirty different countries. 

We lived in areas of incredibly diverse beliefs: Animist, Islamic, Catholic, Russian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Ashkenazi Jew, Hebrew, Shebrew, Webrew, Lutheran, Crystal Methodist, Taoist, Maoist, Wowist, Hindu, Shindu, Windu, etc. 

We learned to accept others when and if they accept ours. 

Besides, I’ve usually got something going on other than religion. Like making a few bucks, having a good time, and searching for local booze and fresh cigars.

But Danny and Marie, our new neighbors, were different. Likeable as a cloudless sunny day, but with an underlying religiosity that made one initially very guarded. 

OK, I admit, I’m an old crusty curmudgeon; cigar smoking and booze swilling geologist who doesn’t take guff from anyone. 

But these characters. 

Really?

You cleave unto those precepts by Brigham Young? 

He’s a noted philanderer. Those precepts of the Book of Mormon and The Pearl of Great Price are obviously plagiarized from other ‘holy’ works. Joseph Smith was a charlatan and snake-oil salesman of the first order. Alpheus Cutler was a member of the Council of Fifty, a band of obvious swindlers. 

But these characters were still our neighbors. 

Khan found their brood very acceptable. Esme has tea with Marie at least once a week. Their acceptance is evidence enough that these are good people to know.

I don’t judge people unless judged by a member of the local judiciary. Besides, Danny enjoys Mountain Dew Baja Blast and leaves my beer alone in the cooler. 

Apart from all that, Danny and I go weekly to the local rifle range. He digs my .577 Tyrannosaur, my .45/70, .454 Casulls, and 4-gauge shotgun.

Danny and Marie. They’re a little weird in their beliefs, but who am I to judge? I mean that sincerely and we’ve become good friends. 

Which leads to Danny walking up on my driveway and motioning to the huge wooden crates…

“So, Rock?”, he asked, “What did you order this time?”

“I’m fucking flummoxed as I really don’t know”, I replied. 

Danny wasn’t in the least affected by my *vulgaris lingua*. He knew me quite well by this time. 

“Need a hand opening them?”, he asked,

“Couldn’t hurt”, I replied and handed him a crowbar as I fired up my 592 XP-G Husqvarna Pro model chainsaw. 

“Nails be damned.”, I smiled and attacked the largest shipping crate. 

Fully five hours later, we’re sweating and gasping like a couple of peccaries on a grain-fed racetrack. 

“Sorry, Doc”, Danny said. “But what the hell is all this?”

I look up from the 750-page owner’s manual. 

“It’s a forklift”, I replied. “Of sorts. Ever see the movie ‘Aliens’?”.

“Yeah…”, he replied, which slowed into a low whistle when he realized at what the hell we were looking.

It seems that my good Agency buddies, Agent Rack and Agent Ruin, somehow got ahold of a wearable military prototype version of a [P-9000 Powered Work Loader](https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/P-5000_Powered_Work_Loader). 

I smiled the smile of Dracula who was just given keys to the blood bank. 

“Bloody hell”, I smirked. “Halloween’s already over. “Can you just see the kids when they ring my door and this emerges?”

“Doc”, Danny said, “I know you have a lot of degrees and are a geologist. But what the hell is all this? You *are* frightening your neighbors.”

“Best I can tell”, I smiled widely, “Is that it’s left for me to test out when I close abandoned mines. You remember last month when I had to go out with LuLuBelle in the dark of the night?

“That’s not just a legend?”, He asked. “Do you really have all those explosives here?”

“Danny, m’boy”, I smiled, “Let me take you on a tour of my backyard.”

One half-hour later, Danny was sitting on a large Cypress stump, shaking his head and trying to re-grasp reality.

Danny gratefully accepted the ice-cold Orange Fanta I handed him. 

“Good Lord, Doc”, he stuttered. “Are you sure it’s safe? It looks like you could start a war with all this…”

“Or conceivably end one.”, I smiled, “Danny. Look at me. I’ve no left hand. I’m covered in keloid scars. I’ve been shot, stabbed and semi-slaughtered; but I’m still here. You think the powers that be would let me have access to large caliber weapons and all sorts of high explosives if I didn’t know what I’m doing?”

“But Doc”, he protested. “You teach at the local college…”

He drifted off into a form of mild panic that I found most entertaining.

“Yeah, that’s right”, I smiled. “I am passing my wisdom onto the next generation. Besides, I have a good time doing so…”

 Danny looked at me and the cold soda in his hand. 

“I won’t tell if you don’t”, I smiled. 

I killed off a six-pack of Special Export (“The Green Death”) quicker than a fraternity party in Milwaukee while pre-assembling the loader with Danny. It’s a good thing that I have all the accouterments to perform mechanical surgery on LuLuBelle. Hydraulic lifts, a one-inch drive hydraulically-operated socket set and various lifts, jacks, A-frames, and chains came in rather handy. 

“Come on back tomorrow”, I said. “Help me put this mechanical mess-terpiece together and I’ll buy you lunch. And dinner, if the assembly goes as a I thought it would. 

Danny agreed and wandered off southwardly. I hoped Khan had made it home when he woofed and slobbered on my already sweat-stained shirt. 

“I really need a drink”, I said to Khan. 

Khan looked at me crossly as he had been off gallivanting with his new buddies all day and I had missed his dinnertime. 

“Of course, of course”, I said as I chopped some of last night’s leftover ribeye into Khan’s bowl. 

“You slobber on my pillow”, I warned him, “And it’s Gravy Train for the next month.”

Khan looked at me with his deep brown eyes. 

“You wouldn’t dare.” he seemed to say. 

“You know I wouldn’t”, I said. He accepted that and slurped down his favorite dinner. That is, one with food.

Khan gulped the last of the ribeye and noted that he wanted to go outside before we retired. 

“I just can’t win”, I muttered as I opened the door. 

Khan woofed and chased the forty or so wild dinosaur turkeys that had taken up residence in our backyard. Oh, they leave every once in a while, but last week I caught them nesting in our pine tree and eating from the songbird feeder we have out back. It’s not hard watching them and slipping back 66 million years as they clean out the food I’ve set out for them. 

“Sixty-six plus years”, I groaned, “And I’m just a concierge for large, goofy animals...”

Khan re-appeared and wondered why I wasn’t upstairs and in bed. 

“I need some shuteye”, I sighed as Khan snuggled up next to me on my pillow. Es stayed downstairs working on some Christmas gifts for our new grandchildren. Later, she’ll shoo Khan and relax in a canineocally pre-warmed bed. 

We don’t get much in the way of traffic being out in the more rural reaches of New Mexico, but evidently someone somewhere leaked information about the crazy geologist and his new mechanical toys. 

I made certain to wave at sightseers as Khan growlingly patrolled the perimeter. I’m not sure which of us unnerved the locals more.

Danny and I spent the next two days putting the load-lifter together. Made of cast iron, plate steel and heavy rolled stainless, the damned contraption weighed in at over 1100 kilos. 

It’s a tracked version, with retractable tracks for when the going gets tight. 

Electrohydraulic power for the most part, the machine hosts a 75 hp gasoline engine that drives all the power-eating necessities like compressors, oil pumps, generators, and the like. 

Designed for military purposes, I’m told there are more advanced models, but Rack and Ruin evidently saved this one from going into the prototype trash heap. 

Good thing I have a big truck and trailer. I can actually fit the blasted thing onto LuLuBelle’s trailer, if I balance the load carefully. 

How I’m going to utilize this contraption while closing mines is something that yet remains to be seen. 

However, it’s a blast to operate. As well as being just the ticket considering my back problems and advancing years. I used it in it’s first outdoor foray to help our adjacent landlord rip out and consign to the brush pile a row of raggedy old apple trees that have outlived their utility. 

“Who needs a chainsaw?”, I chuckled as I sidled up to a 0.5-foot diameter ancient apple tree and without so much as a “Ooof!”, uprooted the thing whole and walked it over to deposit it on the growing burn pile. 

However, Khan hated the contraption. Whenever I parked the garish gizmo in the garage, he’d woof mightily and run for cover. I made certain Khan was secured in the house or back yard whenever I brought this mechanical monster out to play. 

As I noted, if I scooted LuLuBelle up as far as she could go on her trailer, I could drive the loader onto the trailer with centimeters to spare. The hydraulic ramps would fold up *just so* over the loader’s tracks. That way, it was secured to the trailer and a couple of hand-operated “come-alongs” secured it to the ripping hook of LuLuBelle.

I was probably over the load limit for the state, but I promised to transport all this guff only in times of emergency or when I was on official business. 

It didn’t take too long, but I found myself out on the high desert plateau, waiting for Cletus and Arch. 

“Hey guys”, I said. “No terrible emergency today, but since I’m in the area, I thought we’d go close a few old murder holes.”

Arch and Cletus both goggled at the trailer being hauled behind my truck.

“What the hell is that contraption?”, they both asked. “New toys?”

“Ever see the movie ‘Aliens’?”, I asked. 

I explained that it was a gift, of sorts, from my Agency buddies. I explained how they just dropped it off one afternoon and blocked my driveway so I had to assemble the thing. 

“Honey, hush”, Cletus said in a slow, lowering tone when we pulled up to today’s first mine and I slowly backed it off the trailer. 

“Can I play?”, both Arch and Cletus seemed to say in their longing looks as I shut it down and disembarked. 

“Better you than me”, I said and tossed Cletus the keys. Arch was in a right huff. 

“Age before beauty”, I snickered to Arch. “You can be next. In fact, I want both you guys to get real familiar with this gizmo as I don’t want to futz with it more than necessary. I want to get back to blowing shit up, so the sooner you guys get good on this little piece of technology, the better”

“How are we going to do that?”, Arch asked. 

“I have no idea.”, I replied, “I’m just making shit up as we go along. That’s why you’re strapped in and I’m sitting here with a new cigar.”

Cletus fired the machine up and carefully lowered the tracks. He moved forward, backward, while flailing the two twin grasping forks that were going to be employed in mine destruction. 

He moved forward and went to pick up a sizable sandstone rock; one large enough that I’d normally doze it out of the way with LuLuBelle. 

He fumbled with it a bit, got a hold of it, only to have it fall out of his grasp and whang mightily off the superstructure of the load lifter. 

Cletus braced himself for what he thought would be a blizzard of invective and cursing from his boss. 

“That’s fine”, I said, “It’s a fucking tool. Use it as such, just don’t abuse it. I really don’t care if the paint gets scratched, we all have to learn. Just exercise extraordinary care and think things through first. That’s all I can ask or expect.”

Explaining that to them worked so much better than blowing up and screaming at them. I reserve that for potential explosive fuck-ups, not with some new mechanical toy. 

Both Cletus and Arch spent the rest of the morning getting used to the thing of which we hadn’t settled on a name. 

“Doc”, Cletus opined, “She needs a name. ‘Load lifter’ may be descriptive, but not friendly enough for a coworker.”

“OK”, I said, “What’s your idea for a moniker?”

“How about Leslie?” he offered.

“Why Leslie?”, I asked. 

“She reminds me of my first wife”, he chuckled, “Plus, LuLuBelle and Leslie the Load Lifter has a certain *ring* to it.”

“Arch?” I inquired. 

“I like it”, he agreed with his dad. 

“Leslie it is then”, I said. “Let’s grab some lunch and have a proper shakedown and christening after chow.”

One thing about these guys, you don’t have to tell them twice about lunch. 

We built a fire right there in front of the mine and I hauled out the usual lunchtime comestibles of sub-sandwich makings, chips, and drinks. I quickly assembled an Apple-Quince Fritter cake that went first into the Dutch Oven then directly into the campfire’s ashes. 

After lunch and Arch cleaning up the dishes, I had the mine map out and pointed to three or four mines in close proximity that we can run Leslie through. All of these mines were mine, as it were, by the law of right of capture. Weeks before, I staked them out, bladed new access roads, and blocked the entrances so that humans were excluded, but bats, rats, lawyers, and other vermin were allowed in. 

For a while. 

“Let’s check out this mine, the one furthest west. It’s only two clicks distant. I’ll run LuLu over and you can follow in Leslie.” I said to Cletus.

“Aww, Rock”, Arch protested, “I wanted to drive LuLu today.”

I chewed my stumpy cigar, gave a look skyward, and tossed Arch the keys. 

“OK”, I said. “However, you’ll be chauffeuring the boss fella as well.”

“You got it, Boss!”, Arch grinned. 

LuLu, being a D-6 Cat had a bench seat quite wide enough to accommodate a driver and two passengers. 

Or driver and one crotchety, old geologist. 

We checked all fluid levels in both pieces of kit and once satisfied that they were full enough, we fired them up, slowly crossed the tarmac and onto the shoulder of the road. I don’t think Leslie would have any impact on the asphalt, but I knew full well LuLu with her tonnage would fuck the road beyond all recognition. 

So, we’re putt-putting down the shoulder and there’s not a single car, truck or motorcycle to be seen on the road. 

Then Cletus calls me on the radio. 

“Hey, Rock?”, he says, “See that over there? Looks like someone’s in one of your mines. And lookee here, he done left his car parked outside…”

That angered me to no end. The entrance was damn near plowed shut, there’s signage warning of the dangers of trespassing, and how such behavior would be dealt with by the owner and local police. 

Plus, the crowning turd in the punchbowl it that they tore down all the necessary signage remining them to stay the fuck out as this is bat sanctuary. Also that it’s mind-meltingly dangerous, and that trespassers will be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law. 

That is, if they survive their high-velocity gluteus-first exit from the mine.

I let Cletus lead and Arch followed, with me riding shotgun on LuLu. We parked our machinery outside the mine and went to have a look at the auto that was also, by law, trespassing on my property. 

It was an old Chevy Belair, evidently owned by one of the neighborhood idiots. Arch recognized the vehicle and said that some local ‘dickweed’ owned the car and often came to these mines to hide from reality, his parents, and the law. As cannabis is very legal in this state, I wasn’t too taken aback by the chimney-like actions of this old mine wafting the scent out the main adit. 

“Clever”, I snorted, “Park on my property, destroy my signs, and use my mine as a clubhouse. I am seriously not amused.”

“What’s the plan, Rock?”, Cletus asked. 

We chewed over a few possibilities. Like running the car over a few times with LuLuBelle, using the car as target practice, digging a trench and burying the vehicle…

That’s when Cletus came up with a most excellent idea.

“Well, Doc”, Cletus said, “Leslie the Load Lifter needs a good shakedown. Let’s see if she can pick up this miscreant’s car and deposit it elsewhere, off your property and perhaps on top of one of the local mesas.”

“I do like that idea”, I said, “Glad to see that I’m rubbing off on you.”

“Let’s see if we can pick up the car with as little damage as possible”, I said, “Then why not trot it over to Blue Mesa about two clicks distant?”

“Sounds like a plan”, Cletus grinned. He strapped back into Leslie, fired her up and rolled over to become perpendicular with the Chevy. 

Forks 50% closed and horizontal, he slid them one after the other under the chassis of the old Chevy. 

I checked to make sure nothing was going to get smooshed when we lifted the car, like transmission, exhaust system, or fuel tank. 

We were green. Very green. 

“Mr. Cletus”, I enquired, “The show is yours.”

Cletus grinned at my application of a formal sobriquet, as he grinned Cheshirely, and slowly, without any muss or fuss, lifted the car a good meter off the ground. 

“Where would you like this deposited?”, he asked grinningly. 

“Blue Mesa should work”, I said. “Do take care, though, remember this is Leslie’s shakedown cruise.”

Cletus gave me the high sign and lit the cigar he filched from me earlier. He slowly took his first steps into de-mining history as he sauntered off with the Chevy without so much as a grunt or groan. He was fully three-quarters of the way to the mesa when I told Arch to break out the containment suits. 

“No idea what’s going on in this old hole”, I told to Arch, “But it’s probably a simple adit and tunnel. But what better way to scare the living shit out of someone half in the bag from smoking reefer? We wander into the mine in full battle array and communicate via radio. He’ll piss his clothes and freak the fuck out at the same time. Violate the sanctity of my property, will ya’?”

Arch chuckled as we pulled on our P-4 suits and all our gear. I took a few sticks of pre-prepared dynamite to toss into the nether regions of the mine once we shooed out this cement-headed infiltrator. We looked like a couple of extras from the Twilight Zone as we slowly walked over the frontal berm and into the soon-to-be-demolished mine. 

As Arch and I entered the mine, Cletus showed up at the adit and blocked it quite well with Leslie the Load Lifter. She had a couple of scratches, some dirt and other debris, but all this did was make her look meaner. Cletus gave us the high sign as we sauntered off into the growing darkness. 

“Arch?”, I said into the radio.

“Yep, boss?”, he replied. 

“Let me do the talking on this one”, I smiled widely. “They might be smoked or toked up and the situation might get a tad shirty. Let me handle him or them, but you stay in reserve.”

I handed Arch a couple of sticks of DuPont Herculene 75% Xtra-fast with normal fire-and-forget fuses. 

Arch grinned and fell in behind me.

We only had to travel about 150 meters when we saw the glow of a bon or campfire. The smoke was trailing out towards the rear of the mine, indicating we did have air current flow-through and that fact alone was why no had died of carbon monoxide poisoning in this bloody hole.

so this is probably going to be a long text. I am dealing with gut issues for 3-4 years now and really nothings seems to help. I am currently 20 and feel like I am missing out on life because of my gut health. 

It all begun a few years ago after I started taking birth control. I only took it for a few months because it caused me painful cramps a weird pressure in my stomach. I went to different doctors when my stomach issues got worse, but i only got prescribed PPIs and painkillers. I think those two things wrecked my gut even more. A gastroscopy was also performed with no results.

  
In December 2022 i first vistited a gastrologist and natural path. We did a food intolerance test and a stool test and it showed that i had leaky gut and my microbiome was completly wrecked. So based on these results I started taking a powder for my leaky gut, probiotics, zinc, omega 3, magnesium, selenium and I stopped eating things I reacted to. About 6 months later nothing has improved. Even Worse I somehow got Candida. So I had to treat Candida, go on an anti Candida diet for months and tried probiotics again to improve my good gut bacteria and my ph levels. I got rid of my candia but my ph levels just would not go down and good bacteria would not build up either. The last 6 months I tried out a microbiomtherapy (my doctor said this should help me 100%). Suprise Suprise, it did not help me either and almost all my values of my stool test are still the same + I have Candida Again....

  
I really don't know what I can do anymore. I don't drink alcohol, coffee or any sugary drinks. I almost never eat sugar or processed foods. I tried everything from bone broth, to sauerkraut or kefir and really nothing helps. Does anybody know if there are other treatments than probiotics because it feels like they just don't work for me. I just don't know how i can reduce my ph-levels and build up my good gut bacteria. ",2,1731704164.0,Microbiome,2,1.0,False

1gs6bu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1gs6bu4/wife_cheated_on_me_now_im_thriving_while_shes/,Wife cheated on me. Now I’m thriving while she’s spiraling ,"Today marks what would have been the 10 year wedding anniversary for me (32M) and my ex (31F). We met in middle school, began dating in high school, and got married shortly after college. 

We have 3 kids together. My ex, “Anna”, spent the early years of the marriage as a stay at home mom. As the years went on, she became increasingly bored with that, and eventually re-started her college education. With one semester to go, she decided the major she was pursuing no longer interested her, and she dropped out of college. Instead, she began working as a waitress in a local restaurant. Her best friend, “Monica” (38F), also worked there. 

She enjoyed the work and seemed to be doing a good job with it. She was making friends for the first time in years, her depression was getting better, and it seemed to be a positive change in her life. 

I work full time, and with the well-paying serving shifts taking place at night and on weekends, I took on additional responsibilities at home so she could work those shifts. I adjusted my work schedule to have more flexibility for taking the kids to/from school or to be home with them on random days off. I took them to all their weekly sports practices and after school activities. I took on the majority of the cleaning, shopping, and laundry. Anna had some tough years with depression, including one known suicide attempt, so I was happy to take on more familial responsibilities if it allowed her to pursue something that finally provided happiness. 

After a few months working at the restaurant, Anna became close friends with a few female coworkers. Around the same time, she also started telling me more about her work stories with “Dan.” Dan was a 24M line cook at the restaurant. 

At first, they were normal work stories. Funny things that happened at work, how they reacted to rude customers, the latest drama from a workplace that employs a lot of young, drama filled people. But as time went on, she started to tell me about how Dan was hitting on her and telling her she was pretty. 

We had conversations where I shared that I felt their relationship was crossing a line, and I asked that she shut down any non-professional interactions he had with her. As the months went on, I stopped hearing about Dan, and I was assured that he no longer was hitting on her. 

As the months went on, our marriage declined. We no longer made time to date each other. We stopped enjoying spending time with one another. I didn’t outright know she was cheating on me, but I knew our relationship wasn’t the same as it used to be. 

Then in March of this year, she didn’t come home one night after work. It had become a regular occurrence that she would go out for drinks with coworkers after their shifts ended. For quite a while, I was happy for her because it seemed she had made some genuine friends to hang out with. 

The night she didn’t come home from work, I had fallen asleep on the couch while trying to wait up for her. In the early hours of the morning, I called her phone 3 times, wondering where she could be and if she was ok. On the third call, she briefly answered, informed me she drank too much and stayed at Monica’s house, said she’d be home in the morning, and then ended the call. 

Monica had been friends with Anna for several years. We went on double dates with Monica and her ex husband, “James”, prior to their divorce. Monica has a daughter the same age as my daughter, and they’re best friends. 

The problem with Anna’s story was the Monica and I were at our daughters’ dance practice the night that Anna didn’t come home. I knew that Monica was at home with her daughter after dance, not out at a bar drinking, so it didn’t make sense for Anna to be at her house. 

I resolved that I’d talk to Anna about it tomorrow and try to get some sleep before the kids would wake up in a few short hours. As I was drifting off, I remembered that we shared our phone locations through a parental controls app we use for our daughter’s phone. Frantically opening the app, I could see that her location was in an apartment building several miles away. It was the same apartment building that she had once told me was Dan’s building when we were driving past it.

For the next 3 hours, I sat on the couch, thinking about what I’d say to her and waiting for her to walk in the house. 

At 5:30 in the morning, I heard the garage door open. She came stumbling through the door a few minutes later, heavily under the influence and looking like she hadn’t gotten any sleep. 

I asked her where she had been and why she didn’t come home that night. She reiterated that she was at Monica’s after having too many drinks and that she couldn’t have safely driven herself home that night. When I said that I saw Monica at dance and knew she had her daughter with her last night, Anna changed her story and said she was actually at a different coworker/friend’s house, “Natalie.” 

I replied saying that Natalie lives in a single family house, but her location showed her in an apartment building. After a pause that lasted what I’m quite confident was several years, I asked “Are you having an affair with Dan?” To which she simply nodded yes. 

In the coming weeks, we spent time trying to decide if we could repair things or if our marriage was over. We went to couples therapy and I went to therapy individually, too. I knew that I didn’t love her anymore, but I wanted to have a chance to see if we could make things work so that I didn’t lose time with my kids if we were to separate. 

Anna agreed to give us another chance and told me that she ended things with Dan. She broke things off with him at a coffee shop, not knowing what his reaction would be and wanting to do it in a public place. I spent that night consoling my wife as she went through a breakup with her boyfriend. 

The following weeks were a roller coaster. Anna and I went on a few dates as we tried to repair things. Each one was awkward, like a blind first date where you know very little about the person and strain for conversation. There were very few highs and a lot of lows. 

A week later, I heard that Anna was still talking to Dan. I talked to Monica about it, who had learned about the affair at this point, and we decided Monica and her friends from the restaurant would sit Anna down to have an intervention of sorts. I didn’t ask details about what they’d discuss with Anna, trusting that they would do what they thought was best to advise Anna. So after an afternoon spent with the family, and on our way home, I pulled our vehicle over in front of Monica’s home and told Anna to head inside. 

Anna quickly saw what was unfolding. She saw her other friends’ cars in the driveway. Putting the pieces together that they were there to talk to her, Anna refused at first to go inside, but eventually relented. 

Anna came home from the intervention undecided on how to proceed. She wanted to think about whether she wanted to be with Dan or I, and we went to sleep. 

Then after agreeing to continue therapy and trying to work on our relationship, while also agreeing to stop seeing Dan again, I got a text from an unknown number a week later saying that Anna was still seeing Dan. As I pressed for details, it became clear the mystery texter worked with them, and I knew in that moment that my marriage was over. I had had enough with the lying, cheating, and deception. 

Mystery texter eventually revealed their identify. As I talked to them, Monica, and other coworkers of Anna, I learned quite a few things about the affair. That it had been happening for more than 6 months. That they were talking about getting married and having kids. I learned that after Anna knew I was checking her location, she would park her car with her phone in it at non-suspicious locations (her work, friend’s homes, grocery stores, etc.) to make it appear that was doing something something legitimate, all the while she was continuing to cheat on me with Dan. 

Late the evening of finding out from mystery texter that Anna was still cheating, I woke Anna from her sleep and said we were getting divorced. I said I wanted her out of the house ASAP and that we’d figure the rest out later on. 

In the weeks between the intervention with her friends and us formally separating, Monica and I had been texting quite a bit. All of our texts were about getting advice from her on how to talk to Anna about things, or Monica sharing with me confirmation on days that Anna was working (so that I wouldn’t assume Anna was lying and hiding her location by parking at work). The entire conversation stayed within the bounds of me texting my wife’s best friend for advice on how to repair my marriage. 

Following the decision to separate from Anna, I joined a few dating apps. Initially it was to show Anna that I was serious and moving on, despite my head not being in any place to actually date someone new. One night while the kids with were Anna, while I was spending the evening mindlessly swiping right and left, while also texting Monica after she checked in on me to see how I was doing, I decided to ask Monica to get some drinks and talk about how awful Anna had treated both of us. 

Throughout the affair, Anna had spent a lot of time lying to Monica and lying to me about being with Monica when she actually wasn’t, and Monica was hurt by that. 

The evening with Monica went great. We spent 3 hours talking and laughing, sharing things about each of our exes and how they had treated both of us. Her divorce was further along than mine, so we chatted about that, too. I had known Monica for several years at this point, previously as my wife’s best friend, so I was enjoying getting to know a different side of her. 

Several weeks later, Anna finally moved out. She rented a new place and we could finally start moving on with our lives, apart from one another. 

Since then, life has been a tale of two stories. I’ve been in a relationship with Monica for 6 months, finally finding someone that is a good person, makes me happy, and enjoys being with me. Ive lost weight, I workout several times per week, and I completed my first triathlon. I’ve had a lot of good moments with the kids, doing fun activities and trying new things. 

Anna got pregnant immediately after moving out. She quit her job ahead of being fired for sexual harassment, as she was Dan’s supervisor. She bought a new car for Dan, and then lost the need job she had just gotten. News got out that Dan uses cocaine and sells various drugs after he got fired from the restaurant for being high at work. She’s lost most of her friends as they found out about the cheating and lying. 

I’m happy to have moved on and to no longer feel stuck being with someone that’s a terrible person. I feel no sympathy for her as she continues to make poor decisions, but I am pained by her still being someone in my kids lives. Overall, I’m significantly happier than I used to be. 


TLDR: Ex cheats on me for 6 months. We separated and now I’m happily dating her ex best friend. Ex wife is pregnant, unemployed, has lost most of her friends, and is dating her drug addict affair partner. ",31,1731703733.0,cheating_stories,21,0.94,False

Flavor starts off woodsy, slightly bitter/vegetal but in a refreshing way.

Think spoons that make coffee not bitter, and knives that never rust, think chamber pots that make things disappear because they were enchanted to always be clean. Think items that have a basic use, but could be manipulated for evil - like a decanter that ages things, whether its contents are wine or someone's hand.

And what I need now is a simple thing that could be used obscurely to kidnap someone (as in, not something obvious like an invisibility cloak or potion). It could be that it physically traps them, or influences them to follow the kidnapper. I'm coming to you, great builders of reddit, to possibly give me an infusion of inspiration, as I've finally found the light at the end of a long tunnel of stuckness.

English is not my first language and to be completely honest, I decided to come here as a last resort in hope I'll hear some opinion and eventual advice on what I should do. 

I'm 20, moved out from my family house. My father like in title is manipulating my mother in every possible way, making her an emotional wreck. He's saying various different things that oppose each other making her loose any kind of understanding on what ground she's standing on (example: Once he told her he's going to move out. In no less than 30 minutes he came back into the room and said he's not doing that because he doesn't have anywhere to go.) and how she should act. 

He's trying to make her dependent on him by saying that if he leaves, he'll take everything he did in the house with himself (example: He said he'll tore out from the wall the TV he bought, the coffee machine, etc. Mostly electronics) and even destroy everything she has so she'll be left with nothing. 

The worst part is, he wasn't like that in the beginning. He became much more materialistic as the time went by and aggressive, saying he'll resort to violence if my mom'll say / do anything he'll not like. 

I suggested to my mom to call cops on him but she declined because we don't really have any kind of evidence besides the verbal one (Which, mind you, she started recording some of the arguments). 

Besides that, I also have a younger sibling that goes to high school, 3rd grade. He's witnessing majority of their arguments and I'm worried about him because such a high amount of stress isn't good for him. My mother tried to have them only when he's (brother) not around but my father doesn't care. If he wants to argue he'll do so, making my brother stressed out. 

I'm at loss of words because to put it lightly, I'm at absolute loss on what to do. I'm trying to be there for my mom and call her when I can but nowadays she doesn't even have energy for that because of how exhausted she is. Additionally, I can't be always there when needed because of me being a student. Majority of the time I spend in the city where I'm attending my college. 

Any advices what I can do / what to say (To both of them, my mother and father)? I tried multiple times to speak with him any try to suggest that *if he has* to argue he shouldn't done it in front of my brother. I also attempted to explain him that my mom doesn't care for the money he has (Because he rags often how me with my mother have nothing, on how poor we are) but it doesn't seem to stuck. If there's peace it's for max 2 days, then they'll be arguing again. ",1,1731703338.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

**Lost and Found**



**August 5th 2010**

 

The bustling grocery store buzzed with the usual Saturday morning energy as David, a dark-haired man in his early 30s, pushed a cart with little Tanya, a beaming little girl with dark curls and shining brown eyes, perched securely in the seat and waving at everyone they passed.

 

“What do you think, little peanut?” David asked her, pointing at a colourful box of animal crackers.

 

She squealed, waving her hands, and David chuckled, plucking the box from the shelf and placing it in the cart beside her.

 

He continued down the aisles, selecting a few more things, glancing back every now and then to keep her laughing with silly faces and voices. David knelt down to find a can of soup from the back of a bottom shelf, stretching to reach it.

 

Then he stood back up, soup in hand. The seat was empty.

 

The soup dropped from his hand, and his heart seemed to stop mid-beat. “Tanya?” he called, his voice louder than he’d meant, already tinged with panic. His eyes darted around the aisle, scanning the shelves and glancing down to make sure she hadn’t climbed out somehow. “Tanya!” His voice grew louder, frantic now as he searched the aisles, calling her name again and again. He ran, his footsteps echoing through the store, each aisle becoming a fresh nightmare. She wasn’t there.

 

In those helpless moments, David’s world had come apart.

 

**Fourteen Years Later**

 

Anna glared out the car window as her dad, Stuart, pulled into the driveway of their new house. The moving truck was already there, waiting to be unloaded. It was the same routine they’d been through countless times before—packing up their lives and leaving without explanation.

 

“I don’t get why we have to move so much,” Anna muttered as she stepped out of the car, slamming the door behind her.

 

“You know why,” Brenda said, her tone firm but not unkind. “Your dad’s job requires it.”

 

“That’s what you always say,” Anna shot back. “But normal jobs don’t make you pack up and leave every six months.”

 

Brenda sighed, rubbing her temples. “We’ve talked about this. Moving is just part of our lives right now. And this place looks nice, doesn’t it?” She gestured to the modest two-story house with a small porch.

 

Anna rolled her eyes and trudged inside, lugging a box of her things. The house smelled faintly of fresh paint and cleaning supplies, the same impersonal scent as every house they’d rented before.

 

By the time they’d unpacked the essentials, the sun had started to set. Anna sat on the edge of her bed, staring at the bare walls of her new room. The thought of staying cooped up inside, homeschooling with her mom, made her stomach churn.

 

“I want to go out,” she announced as she walked into the kitchen, where her parents were unpacking dishes.

 

Brenda looked up sharply. “Out? Where?”

 

“Just around. Explore the neighbourhood or something.”

 

Brenda’s face tightened. “Anna, this is a strange town. It’s not safe to wander around on your own.”

 

Anna’s eyes narrowed in frustration. They said that every time they moved, warning her about one danger or another in every new place. It had kept her isolated, drifting through her teenage years with hardly any lasting friendships.

 

“I’m not a little kid anymore, you know. I just want to go out and explore a little.”

 

Brenda’s face softened, but she still shook her head. “Not yet, Anna. Why don’t you help me finish unpacking?”

 

Anna murmured something noncommittal, slipped her phone and wallet into her pocket, and snuck out the back door.

 

The neighbourhood was quieter than she’d expected, with a few houses lined up down the street and a handful of cars parked along the curbs. She walked for a while, eventually spotting a store at the end of the block with a sign out front that read: Bargain-Mart.

 

Stepping into the store, Anna immediately felt the cool air conditioning wash over her, a welcome relief after the stuffy car ride. She walked down an aisle, scanning shelves for a drink to quench her thirst. As she picked out a soda, she noticed a small, hand-written Help Wanted sign hanging near the register.

 

Curious, she approached the register where an elderly woman with warm eyes and a friendly smile stood. Her nametag read, “Wendy.”

 

“You look like you’ve had a long day,” Wendy said, her smile brightening Anna’s mood.

 

“Yeah, we just moved here,” Anna replied. “How’s the town?”

 

Wendy shrugged with a twinkle in her eye. “It’s quiet but good people. New girl, huh?”

 

“Yeah. Do you know if you guys are really hiring?” Anna pointed to the sign.

 

“Oh, we are! Sure could use another young one to help stock the shelves, especially on the night shifts. It’s not too hard, just a bit of cleaning and helping the customers.”

 

Anna smiled, her excitement growing. A job would be the perfect way to make some friends, learn about the town, and just get out of the house a bit. “Could I take an application?”

 

“Absolutely!” Wendy pulled out a clipboard and handed it over. “Take this home, bring it back when you’re ready, and we’ll get you set up.”

 

Anna hurried back home; application clutched in hand. She slipped through the door, cheeks still flushed with excitement.

 

“Mom, Dad!” she called out, brandishing the application. “I found a job opening! I want to work at Bargain-Mart.”

 

Brenda’s face clouded with worry immediately. “Are you sure that’s a good idea, Anna? You don’t even know anyone in this town.”

 

“It’s just a part-time job. Besides, I’m seventeen now. I should be able to work a few shifts.”

 

Brenda hesitated, but when she saw the pleading look on Anna’s face, she sighed. “Fine. Just… be careful. And if anything feels off, you come straight home, alright?”

 

Anna grinned. “Alright. Thanks, Mom!” She clutched the application tightly, already picturing herself working at the store, making new friends, and finally getting a taste of independence.

 

But as she headed to her room, she noticed Brenda watching her with a strange expression—one that lingered with an edge of unease Anna couldn’t quite understand.

 

**Later That Day**

 

David dragged himself through the front door of his sister Lori’s home, kicking off his shoes and letting out a sigh that seemed to drain the last bit of energy he had. The house was quiet, save for the distant hum of a television down the hall where Lori’s husband, Nick, was probably half-dozing on the couch. For a second, David considered joining him, but the day had been long, and he knew the night wouldn’t be much easier. Work helped fill the days, but the nights—those were still hard.

 

After his daughter vanished all those years ago, David’s life had unravelled at an unstoppable pace. Losing his job, his home, and any hope of finding Tanya had left him in a constant haze of grief and regret. Lori had insisted he move across the country to live with her, worrying that he was sinking too far into depression to keep going alone. Now, he lived with them and worked at Bargain-Mart, scraping by, days blending into one another in a blur of routine and exhaustion.

 

He made his way to his room, shut the door, and lay down on the bed. Sleep, when it came, was always fitful, and tonight was no different. David closed his eyes, hoping for a dreamless night but already sensing that his thoughts would once again wander back to Tanya, as they always did.

 

**A Few Days Later**

 

Anna tugged at the hem of her blouse nervously, glancing at her reflection in the dusty glass door as she entered Bargain-Mart. Her blouse was crisp, and her skirt made her feel a little older, but the jitters hadn’t gone away. It was just a job interview, she reminded herself, but it felt like a bigger deal. This was her chance to finally have some independence, to be around people her own age, and to start building something for herself.

 

She checked in at the counter, and Wendy gave her an encouraging smile. “David’s doing the interviews today. He might seem a little...distant, but don’t worry,” Wendy said, her eyes twinkling. “Just be yourself. He’ll come around.”

 

Anna nodded, grateful for Wendy’s reassurance. She waited by the back office until David emerged, his face weary and unreadable. He gave her a brief nod and gestured for her to follow him into the small, cluttered room.

 

The interview began with standard questions, but David’s demeanour was so detached that Anna couldn’t help but feel a pang of doubt. He barely looked at her, reading off questions from a form in a low, almost monotone voice. “Do you have any previous work experience?”

 

“No, but I’m a fast learner,” she replied, hoping she sounded confident.

 

“Why do you want to work here?”

 

“Because I’d like to gain some experience, and, um, I really want to be part of a team,” she said, fumbling slightly as she tried to match his impassive tone. But David barely acknowledged her answers, simply nodding and moving to the next question.

 

By the end of the interview, Anna was convinced he didn’t like her. She looked down, avoiding his gaze as he flipped through his notes. But then he cleared his throat. “You’re hired. You can start on Monday.”

 

Anna’s eyes widened, and a grin broke out across her face. “Really? Thank you! I promise, I won’t let you down!”

 

He gave a quick nod, looking slightly uncomfortable with her excitement. “Just be here on time. Wendy will show you the ropes.”

 

That evening, Anna dashed into the house, bursting with excitement.

 

“I got the job!” she announced, unable to keep the joy out of her voice.

 

Brenda gave a tight smile. “Congratulations, honey,” she said, her voice careful. “I’m so happy for you.”

 

“Yes, well done,” Stuart added, his smile just as strained. “Just make sure you’re safe, okay?”

 

Anna sighed. “Of course, Mom, Dad. I’ll be fine. It’s just a grocery store.”

 

But Brenda seemed unconvinced, a flicker of worry still in her eyes. “Well, just in case,” she said, reaching into a drawer and pulling out a small canister of pepper spray. “I want you to take this. You can’t be too careful.”

 

Anna rolled her eyes, but she took it, tucking it into her pocket. “Alright, I’ll carry it with me.” She didn’t want to argue, not when they’d finally let her do something on her own.

 

**Monday**

 

On her first day, Anna arrived early, nerves bubbling up in her chest as she walked through the doors. Wendy was waiting for her, as promised, wearing her usual warm smile.

 

“Welcome to your first day, Anna!” she said cheerfully. “Let’s get you started.”

 

Wendy showed her the basics, explaining the register, introducing her to a few regulars, and giving her a sense of the store’s rhythm.

 

“And don’t worry about David,” Wendy added with a wink. “He’s a little gruff, but he has his reasons. Underneath, he’s got a good heart.”

 

A few hours into her shift, Wendy led Anna over to the shelving section and introduced her to Miguel, her trainer for the day. Miguel was about twenty-five, with a mischievous smile and a constant stream of stories about his life. He started by showing Anna the best way to stock and organise, going over the basics.

 

Before long, Miguel was recounting some of his recent dating disasters with flair. “So, I went on this date with this guy,” he said, gesturing with a can of soup as he spoke, “and he tells me he’s a professional magician. Well, turns out his ‘magic trick’ was disappearing halfway through dinner.”

 

Anna stifled a laugh, already warming to Miguel’s playful energy. “Well, at least you don’t have to wonder what happened to him,” she said, grinning.

 

“Oh, you think that’s bad? Wait until I tell you about the guy who showed up in a suit covered in sequins.” Miguel raised his eyebrows and gave her a knowing look. “That was a whole adventure.”

 

Throughout the day, Miguel’s chatter kept Anna entertained, and her nervousness gradually faded. By the time her shift ended, she felt like she’d known him for ages. She waved goodbye to Wendy, who winked and told her she’d done a great job.

 

**Later That Week**

 

Anna rushed through the kitchen, grabbing her jacket from the back of a chair, her eyes darting toward the clock on the wall. Her shift started in ten minutes, and she was already running late, thanks to her parents’ sudden insistence on a family breakfast. Stuart had lingered over his coffee, and Brenda had asked her three different times if she was sure she had everything she needed in her bag. It was starting to feel like they were stalling her on purpose.

 

“Mom, I’ve got to go,” Anna said, trying to keep the edge out of her voice as she put her jacket on.

 

“Are you sure you don’t want a little more toast? You’ve hardly eaten,” Brenda replied, fussing over the dishes as if there wasn’t a clock ticking.

 

“No, I’m good,” Anna said firmly, squeezing her way past her parents and toward the door.

 

She was getting the distinct impression they were secretly hoping her job wouldn’t last long. Brenda still had that worried look whenever Anna talked about Bargain-Mart, and Stuart kept making comments about how tired she seemed. They wanted her safe, sure, but it was more than that—they just didn’t want her out there, in the world, doing anything on her own.

 

Finally, she was out the door and half-running to Bargain-Mart. She arrived, breathless, ten minutes past her start time, and spotted David by the registers. He glanced up as she hurried in, his mouth set in a line as he took in her flustered appearance.

 

“You’re late,” he said, his tone flat but unmistakably irritated.

 

“I’m so sorry,” Anna replied quickly, not wanting to get on his bad side this early on. “It won’t happen again.”

 

“I understand things happen, but being on time is important. Try to make sure it doesn’t happen again.”

 

He didn’t wait for her response, just nodded curtly and walked off to handle a small line at the register. Anna swallowed, a prickle of embarrassment creeping up her neck. She didn’t want to lose this job; it was the first time she’d really felt like she belonged somewhere, and she didn’t want to give David any more reason to doubt her. She made a mental note to be extra careful about leaving the house on time from now on.

 

When her break finally arrived, Anna made her way to the break room, where Wendy was sitting with a cup of tea and a crossword puzzle.

 

“Long morning?” Wendy asked with a sympathetic smile.

 

“You could say that,” Anna replied, letting herself sink into a chair. “David nearly bit my head off for being late.”

 

Wendy chuckled, shaking her head. “He can be a bit of a stickler, can’t he?”

 

“A bit?” Anna muttered, feeling the last of her frustration bubbling up. “I mean, I was only ten minutes late, and he looked at me like I’d committed a crime or something.”

 

Wendy paused, a thoughtful look crossing her face. “You know, David’s had a rough go of things. He might not show it, but he’s had it harder than most.”

 

Anna’s irritation softened as Wendy went on, her voice lowering.

 

“A long time ago, he had a little girl. Tanya. Sweet as a button, or so he used to say. But one day, she… disappeared. Right from under his nose. They were in a store, just like this one, and he turned away for a second. When he turned back, she was gone.”

 

Anna felt her heart sink. She glanced down at her hands, feeling the rush of guilt sweep over her. She’d been complaining about David’s grouchy attitude without any idea what he’d gone through.

 

“That’s… awful,” she murmured.

 

“It was,” Wendy replied, her voice softening. “He searched everywhere, did everything he could, but she was just… gone. And David… well, he lost everything. His home, his job, his wife had died six months before. He eventually moved here to be with his sister, and now he just works to keep himself busy. He doesn’t like to talk about it, so I wouldn’t bring it up.”

 

Anna swallowed, feeling a lump rise in her throat. “I didn’t know.”

 

As Anna’s break ended, she stood up with a new resolve. She was going to show David he could rely on her, that she wouldn’t be a disappointment.

 

At the end of her shift, she spotted David by the back office, tallying receipts from the day. She walked up, taking a steadying breath as she approached.

 

“Mr. Black?”

 

He looked up, his expression wary.

 

“I just wanted to apologise again for being late. I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again.”

 

David studied her for a moment, his eyes softening slightly. He nodded. “Thank you, Anna. Just… work on your timekeeping, alright?”

 

“I will,” she promised, giving him a small smile before heading toward the door.

 

That night, as Anna sat in her room, she thought about telling her parents what she’d learned about David. But as she turned the idea over in her mind, she hesitated. Her parents would probably just latch onto the story as another reason to worry, another reason to keep her close and sheltered.

 

No, she decided. This was her life, her job, and her chance to do something for herself. She’d keep David’s story to herself.

They say necessity is the mother of invention, but I say sleep deprivation is the mother of shut up and take my money. Which is why I decided to check out this formula dispensing machine from Baby Brezza.

# First Impressions

The box itself had more warnings than my birth control pills, which seemed appropriate given that both are designed to keep you from losing your mind, just in very different ways.

Setting it up on my counter, right next to my actual coffee maker, I couldn't help but feel like I'd crossed some invisible line into ""extra"" parent territory.  But sleep deprivation makes you do crazy things.

The setup process was mostly straightforward, though I did spend an embarrassing amount of time trying to figure out which way the funnel went in.

This machine doesn't just look fancy, it looks purposeful. Every feature seems designed by someone who's actually been in the trenches of night time feedings. It's like they gathered a focus group of zombie-like parents and said, tell us what would make your life easier, and then actually listened.

# My Favorite Features

**One-touch operation**. Press one button, and bam  perfectly mixed formula appears like magic. No more shake-weight bottle mixing sessions that leave you looking like you just completed a CrossFit workout in your pajamas.

**Temperature control system.** Three temperature settings might seem excessive until you realize your baby has opinions about bottle temperature that would put a Starbucks barista to shame. The highest setting hits about 98°F, which is basically body temperature - because apparently, babies are fancy like that. It's like having a tiny Gordon Ramsay who can't talk yet but definitely has thoughts about food temperature.

**Formula storage container**. The airtight container on top holds about 700g of formula, which translates to enough to get you through several days without having to refill. The container is UV-protected, which means your formula won't get a tan sitting on your counter. It's more protected from sun damage than I am on my best day.

**Customizable portions.** You can choose between 2-10 ounces in 1-ounce increments, like having a bartender for babies. The precision here is crucial because apparently, babies are very particular about portion control (unlike me during the fourth trimester)

**WiFi connectivity**. Yes, you can make bottles from your phone. It's nice for those moments when you want to feel tech-savvy while still wearing yesterday's sweatpants. But you'll probably still get up to grab the bottle anyway, so this feature is more neat party trick than anything.

# Pros

**Saves time.** Making a bottle takes about 10 seconds. In parent time, that's approximately 0.2 meltdowns. And it means no more shaking, yay!

**Consistency.** Every bottle comes out perfectly mixed, and your baby gets the same concentration every time, (which is more than I can say for my manual mixing abilities after 48 hours of no sleep.)

**Excellent temperature control.** No more playing ""is this too hot?"" with your forearm like some sort of sleep-deprived temperature gauge.

**Clean to use.** Less powder flying around means less formula dust coating every surface in your kitchen. Your counter no longer looks like Tony Montana's desk, which is a definite plus. Plus, you can pretend your kitchen is actually clean when visitors come over (just don't let them open any cabinets).

# Cons

**Cleaning.** You need to wash the funnel every four bottles, which feels like a lot when you're in the trenches of newborn life. It's like having a high-maintenance pet that also feeds your baby.

# Final Thoughts

**It's a great buy for:**

* Parents who value sleep over money
* Anyone who's ever dumped formula powder all over themselves at 3am
* People who appreciate the finer things in life, like not having to do math while sleep-deprived
* Parents who have given up on ever having nice things again but will make an exception for this

**Not for:**

* Minimalists who break out in hives at the sight of another kitchen appliance
* Budget-conscious people who don't mind playing midnight chemist
* People who actually enjoy measuring and mixing formula (who hurt you?)
* Those who think ""roughing it"" builds character (your baby disagrees)

Results:

https://preview.redd.it/35xdjhcfr41e1.png?width=996&format=png&auto=webp&s=715426b1bddcd1eb7b7a1a847cbca91ab8983684

Background:

I took my 1st blood test \~6 months ago (May). I was shocked to learn I had high cholesterol and to get prescribed a statin. I decided to not take the statin and to try lifestyle changes first.

Previous lifestyle:

* Healthy weight, didn't smoke, didn't drink anything except water (no alcohol, energy drinks, soft drinks, coffee)
* Mostly cooked at home (ate out 2-3 times a week, sometimes fast food), didn't eat snacks or junk food but ate white rice, pasta, ground beef, sausage, hot dogs, and cheese frequently
* Mostly sedentary (WFH), but I had just started walking on an under-desk treadmill and had lost a few pounds

After 1st test (May-September):

* Diet changes:
   * Stopped eating: red meats, processed meats, dairy, added sugar, ultra-processed foods, fried foods, eggs, white flour, white rice
   * Started eating: brown rice, more vegetables (red/black/pinto beans, lentils, okra, green beans, carrots), more fruit (apples, peaches, plums, avocados), nuts (pecans, cashews, almonds)
   * Replaced red meats with skinless chicken breasts/thighs/lean ground turkey and replaced butter/other oils for cooking with olive oil
   * Reduced eating out to about once a week, keeping to my diet (examples: Chipotle brown rice bowl, grilled chicken salad w/o cheese or dressing, corn tortilla tacos w/o cheese or sauce)
   * Drank more water
* Exercise changes:
   * Increased my treadmill walking to \~3 miles a day and was a bit more active in general

2nd test (September):

* I lost 15 pounds from these changes and felt much healthier, but I was out of the country for 1 month & not able to keep up most of my new lifestyle during that time, so I was not expecting a huge improvement after \~3 months. However, I was disappointed with the minor improvements and I started to doubt that my lifestyle could lower my numbers significantly. Ultimately, I decided to continue with my changes, make some additional changes, and be more strict with my diet and exercise.

After 2nd test (September-November):

* Diet changes:
   * Started eating chia pudding (2 tbsp chia seeds + 1/2 cup almond milk + berries) every day
   * Tried to add more vegetables and fruits every day for more fiber
* Exercise changes:
   * Started doing a 30-minute elliptical workout every day (aiming to stay in Zone 3 on my Apple Watch to get the recommended amount of moderate-intensity exercise)

3rd test (November):

* I was honestly not expecting much improvement with my 3rd test after the minimal improvements with my 2nd test, as I hadn't made many additional changes and I'd only lost a few more pounds. Here are my guesses as to why my results greatly improved with my 3rd test:
   * The initial lifestyle changes were working, they just took longer than 3 months to show (I've read that this can be true for women)
   * The moderate-intensity exercise made the difference (seems unlikely given everything I've read about LDL) or the chia seeds made the difference (seems unlikely for such a small change)
   * My higher numbers were caused (at least in part) by active weight loss, which is now stabilizing

All in all, I am so happy to have improved my cholesterol and my health, and I plan to continue with all of these lifestyle changes. I hope this is helpful to anyone who was upset by their initial results or anyone who has not yet seen results from their hard work - I've been there too, and you can do it! Happy to answer any questions!

However, I have recently been experiencing some discomfort when visiting the outlet near my house. The barista manager there has been giving me rather unpleasant vibes lately. For instance, on Halloween, I had taken my sister to Dutch Bros as she wanted the  salted caramel hot chocolate. When we had gotten there it  was packed  and the brorista manger was taking orders outside on both first and second  lane well it was my turn to order they came off a bit rude when I was ordering. I payed then I was about to pull up when he let a car from the second lane cut infront of me which was fine it wasn't  an issue. I got my drink then I left.  We'll today I went to dutch bros to get some coffee to get my morning  started when I had order a small hot chocolate  and a large lemonade for my lunch  later and I remember that they were still giving away the bracelets well I pulled up and got my large and small drink and I asked nicely about the bracelets only for the brorista manger to look at me rude while the very polite brorista was looking for them and tell her that there weren't  anymore but I clearly  saw them because she had them. I said that  it was okay and to have an amazing  day as I drove away.

1gs5ufz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateHistoryHub/comments/1gs5ufz/cleopatra_and_antony_win_the_battle_of_actium/,Cleopatra and Antony win the Battle of Actium,"The Battle of Actium was really the first and last battle of consequence in the final civil war of the republic. 

The skirmish outside Alexandria by the Hippodrome a year later only slowed Octavian down for a day. There was no hope of victory. 

I won’t go into a recap of the battle but it ended with Antony and Cleopatra breaking Octavians blockade of the Ambracian gulf thus securing her massive treasury and the core of the heavy warships. 

The rest of the navy was meant to disengage and follow. The massive but disease ridden land army was meant to make its way to Egypt or possibly Antioch, on foot. 

Both were captured. 

In my alternate history, 16 year old Caesarion recklessly arrives unlooked for with the Ptolemaic internal army and fleet that worked within Egypt.  His arrival is cinematically just as Cleopatra’s squadron has broken through Octavian’s center and opened its sails. 

Caesarion descends on Octavian’s rear as Cleopatra’s heavy ships turn round and follow suit. Antony, instead of abandoning his flagship for Cleopatra’s, abandons it to rejoin his land forces. 

Hilarity ensues. 

Jk jk. I imagine such a reversal would win the day for Cleopatra, hopefully killing or capturing Agrippa, without losing Caesarion or Antony. Agrippa was too damn good and would need to go to secure the future since Antony wasn’t on the same level strategically or tactically. 

Anyway, from there the future is bright. In my head, Caesarion and Antony invade Italy. I think with Caesarion at her side even Cleopatra could be present since she could now remind the populace of her connection to their beloved Caesar in his true heir. 

But here my revision gets fantastical. Antony dismantles Rome’s empire into independent republics:

- Italy/Rome
- Gaul. Which could be split in two to remain powerful enough to check Rome. I imagine a reinvigorated Massalia.
-  Sardinia, Corsica
-  Spain

I imagine Antony turning Sicily into his personal kingdom to be inherited by Antyllus.

North Africa - Mauritania, Numidia, Carthage - would be divided into client kingdoms similarly to actual history. 

The Ptolemaic Kingdom would now include Greece and Asia, possibly annexing the treacherous client kingdoms of Anatolia. It would effectively be the eastern Mediterranean from Greece and Cyrenaica to Armenia. 

I imagine Caesarion would be 18 by the end of the conquest of Italy and truly rule jointly with Cleopatra. 

Ok coffee’s done and I’m off.

Harsh coffee and lots of channeling first, but OPV mod from 14 to 8.5 bar solved this problem. I'm using traditional very dark Italian beans and the single basket. I know people hate it, but find the difference to the double basket small enough to not really notice without side-by-side comparison. Guess it's more of a problem with lighter specialty roasts. 

Everyone is saying the grinder is super important and the Sage grinder is awful. I recently bought a Kingrinder K6 for pourover, so I have the opportunity to test this myself. Dialed it in today and I think the coffee was much smoother and less harsh, but without a blind side-by-side comparison, this is useless IMO. 

## Now to the question:
How do I properly set up a comparison? Do I dial in the K6 to get the exact same extraction time? I guess this would mean a smaller grind size for the K6, which probably produces less fines. Or do I dial in by taste to get the same balance of acidity and bitterness that I get with the Sage grinder? And how do I get the first cup to have the same temperature as the second when I try them side by side?",2,1731702345.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Humira didn't seem to work and I hope the prednisone stop gap kicks in but my symptoms seem even worse. Maybe stress. I got an appointment with my GI doc next week and I know her answer to this will be go for a better diet, some of her patients say it helps, but it's not really evidence based. 

I know diet is a contentious topic here at times, but I'm asking this respectfully and I know individual differences are extremely real with health and diets.

I do wonder if a full overhaul has made a difference for anyone. I eat a lot of trash and I do wonder if that caught up to me after being lucky to be in remission over half my life, (for which I'm still very grateful!) I hope my colon isn't giving me the finger forever now lol. 

A better diet can't ever hurt one's health, of course. I should read literature, but my gut feeling (haha) is that a rogue autoimmune system only cares so much about an anti-inflammatory diet.

I have mental health stuff and hang-ups about food, and a dietician said I need to be ready. I'm trying a bit but an overnight overhaul is a lot. The dietician said diet can substantially help UC but yeah again idk.

A simpler day-to-day and less loaded question too though! 

Sometimes folks here mention trigger foods. Do you usually mean an annoying blip or a full blown flare when you eat or drink these things? It's not smart or pleasant but coffee doesn't send me to the ER or anything even with my going on a year flare existence. 

Is it more like food sensitivity where you eat a trigger food and then ""oh God that was a mistake"" for a few hours or a day or two? Like FODMAP IBS say? Iykyk. Or a friend with divereticulitis said sometimes she caved and ate popcorn and paid. Or a lactose intolerant person hitting a milkshake even know they know better.  Etc etc. 

It's not like you have food X and your biologic stops working full stop, right? This seems like kind of a silly question, but I'm curious about experiences.

1gs5rr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1gs5rr8/healed_from_esophagitis_gastritis_4_months/,Healed from Esophagitis & Gastritis (4 months),"Hello. I just wanted to share my recent experience of Esophagitis and Gastritis with ulcers. I wanted to share what I believe did right and also mistakes I think I made. This is also in no way shape or form medical advice... just sharing a personal experience.

Brief history: 31 year old male. Have suffered from heartburn & gerd since mid to late teens. Self treated with over the counter antacids and acid reducers such as tums and pepcid. Symptoms generally were on and off throughout the past decade but definitely triggered by coffee, oily foods, and sleeping too soon after meals. Symptoms finally spiraled during my late 20s and started becoming harder to manage. Finally got esophagitis and gastritis 4 months ago.

First thing - the gastritis & esophagitis was brought on mostly by my own bad habits, diet, and stress. This is my belief.

Things I did correct:

- went to urgent care clinic & sought treatment. Received pantoprazole PPI to control stomach acid and help stomach healing.

- scheduled an endoscopy to evaluate any damage, possible H.pylori, etc

- took the medication (40mg pantoprazole) every morning daily for over 1 month.

- stuck to a very strict bland diet for at least 2 weeks before slowly introducing other foods. (Eggs, and cream of wheat were my go-to)

- identified primary trigger (coffee. In this case espresso)

- made sure to sleep in an elevated position to avoid acid regurgitation while sleeping

- made sure to eat no later * than 4 hours before bed

Huge Mistakes I made:

- reverted to old habits almost as soon as I started feeling normal again.

- did not follow through with endoscopy (appointment cancelled due to florida hurricanes, and never rescheduled)


After 1 month of panto/PPI I was back to feeling normal. After reverting back to my old ways, it only took about 2 weeks for the gastritis symptoms to come back, except different and worse. This time rather than having the globus sensation, it felt like a sharp stabbing pain throughout my stomach (ulcers).

Called and had panto prescription renewed and began taking it again. Only this time the panto didnt seem to do much. 

Now here is the strange part. After the endoscopy was cancelled, I called and insisted that I have an H.Pylori test done. They told me I would need to get off panto for 2 weeks for the h. Pylori test to be accurate. I immediately stopped the pantoprazole. The next 2-3 days I experienced extreme acid reflux, beyond what I had previously experienced. I believe they refer to this as rebound acid production. After the 3 days however my symptoms completely disappeared, and for the remainder of the two weeks, my stomach pain and acid reflux was gone. And this was OFF pantoprazole.

I am currently still off of my pantoprazole, as I appear to have less symptoms than I had while taking them. I understand that this may not be the case for most people, however at this current time it looks like the PPI's were actually causing more acid reflux and prolonging my issues instead of resolving them. Currently grateful as I thought I would be on PPI's for life.

I do believe however that the Pantoprazole was instrumental in healing during that first month of treatment, as it did work during that time. This is important. However its effectiveness disappeared after about a month.

My biggest lesson and takeaway from this, is to not revert back to my old habits and diet that caused the issues. Now that I have identified the main triggers, I will be avoiding them.",0,1731702254.0,GERD,0,0.5,False

I would really appreciate any feedback for revisions or suggestions (places to check out, to dine at, etc.) for our itinerary! I've done my best to read the winter FAQs and read the other posts here. We prefer suggestions from locals and love hidden gems and don't mind doing touristy things as long as the crowds aren't too large.

This is our last minute, unofficial honeymoon getaway. Our primary focus is taking in as much of the beautiful scenery as possible. We're interested in doing a couple easy-to-moderate hikes (we are bringing ice cleats), but not interested in anything particularly adventurous; no skiing/snowboarding. We will be renting a car from YYC so likely we'll be driving to most destinations. No interest in drinking/nightlife. Due to health concerns, unfortunately I cannot visit any of the spas/hot springs at the moment.

I was having some abdominal pain over the summer, and saw my doctor in July for it. The pain was hard to describe, but for the most part I think it was right around my breasts (on both sides) and going down the middle. I initially assumed it was anxiety related. 

My doctor sent me for some ultrasounds, which I didn’t get done until October. Everything is looking okay except for a small mass on my liver (2.3x1.7x1.4cm). The report states it’s “benign-appearing” and likely a focal nodular hyperplasia. 

The abdominal pain seems to come for a few days every few weeks (hence why I assumed it was related to anxiety or just my mental health in general). This week I’ve had a loss of appetite, but I’ve been eating one small meal a day along with my daily coffee. I am feeling very full, up to my throat - I don’t know how else to describe it. I’m having heartburn, and every now and then I’m having abdominal discomfort. 

Could all of this be related to the mass they found? I understand the mass is quite small, but I’m not sure what would cause such significant discomfort. I have not changed my diet. I’m low carb… but not quite keto. I’m not focusing on fats at all. 

I’m female, 5’9 and 176lbs.

Back in August our landlord gave us an eviction so her son could move in. Now, we've lived here 6 years and rent prices have skyrocketed since then, so we're pretty sure they want more money, whether their son moves in or not. So we've been looking for a new place. 

I've lost count of how many places we've seen and applied to. We both have good jobs and are fortunate that we make good money and have enough savings we can afford to move and pay more than we are now. And we've been rejected for our credit scores, our income, our adorable sweet kitten and because we don't have children. We looked into buying, but couldn't find anything in our price range that won't need major renovations. Prices are so ridiculous in our area, we'd be paying at least an extra $1000 a month for something similar. In fact, we would be lucky to get a studio apartment for what we pay right now. 

So we expand our search area to pretty much anywhere in southern Ontario. It's a big province, you'd think there would be something. Nope, either ghosted or things get snapped up before anyone answers. 

Today a place we've been interested in took a price drop, so I called them and asked hey can we come see it and get an application. To even get the application, the landlord is only considering people with a minimum $100,000/year salary and 800+ credit score. 

Landlords will also rent to you if you pay multiple months in advance. Lost out on at least one place because of that. 

Did you know everyone does credit checks for rental applications and your credit takes a hit every time? Found that one out the hard way when my score dropped 100 points over the last few months. 

Oh and I might lose my job if we end up having to move out of the area, because being able to be in an office where we still take all of our meetings online instead of in a room together is more important than having safe, affordable housing even though I can easily be fully remote and was for over a year.

\---

Sonic was dead.

Eggman should have been elated, he should have been excited. After all, he no longer had that pesky Hedgehog foiling his plans for world domination! But that was also the exact issue at hand here. He no longer had that pesky Hedgehog foiling his plans, it practically meant that the world was his to conquer . . . but there was a hollowness to that victory.

One that soured any thought of conquest.

What was the point of conquest if he couldn't crush the spirit of his greatest enemy?

Thus here he found himself, despondent and in his own grief. He was hunched over a table as he operated upon Metal Sonic, giving him back the ability to transform into his Overlord self. Sage had insisted upon it, wanting to see her brother as powerful as he could be.

She had also insisted that he reintegrated Metal Sonic's vocabulator, but Eggman had pushed back on that one. He recalled the utter arrogance that Metal Sonic used to have, the pointed insults towards his creator. He was not eager to experience that anytime soon.

So, he compromised and  told Sage that he'd give Metal Sonic his voice back for his birthday.

That was enough to make his daughter smile and dismiss herself to her duties.

As he continued to operate upon his greatest creation, the door wooshed open and entered his assistants, Orbot and Cubot.

""BOSS!"" Cubot shouted to garner the attention of Eggman. In an instant the scientist turned around glaring at the two assistant droids.

""Can't you see I'm busy!""

""R-right, your sourness!"" Cubot retreated back behind Orbot. The red robot instead rolled forward, unperturbed by Eggman's rage.

""You said to come get you if we have any updates on the Sonic situation, sir!""

Eggman's back straightened in surprise. He took a breath as he focused back on upgrading Metal Sonic, his head tilted towards Orbot as he heard out his droid.

""We followed the trail of chaos energy and found it disappeared! Of course, Sage set up a program to try to find vestigial energy and eventually we found that there was a warp there! The chaos energy entered into a new universe before emerging back into our own.""

Eggman mulled over this information, recognizing the implications of that statement. Sonic was in a different universe and had called the Chaos Emeralds to come to him. Something had pressed him to go into his Super Form, and he had never returned from it.

""Orbot! Cubot! Warm up the Eggmobile and insert the Warp Topaz into the gem slot! I'll investigate myself once I'm done here!""

He ordered them, ignoring the worried looks of his droids.

The door wooshed closed, leaving him with only his thoughts. His fists clenched tightly around his tools, questions and anger bounced around in his skull. He had thought by finding the source of the incident, that he would know what happened . . . but instead he received far more questions than answers.

A soft breath taken.

He closed up Metal Sonic and ran diagnostics before booting him back up.

""Your upgrades are complete and just in time too, after all we just found out where that blasted hedgehog perished! You'll be coming along with me as I investigate.""

He informed the robot, who looked at him with rage filled optics. Just the name alone was enough to send Metal into a fury, but more than that . . . his goal had been stolen from him. He hadn't the chance to prove that he was the /REAL/ Sonic, that he was better than the faker.

Soon enough the Duo were on their way, with Sage tagging along within the Eggmobile's system. They found themselves on a remote beach, a crater on one side of it and scorched marks littered the battle field. Eggman happed out of his Eggmobile and crouched down, eyes narrowing as he spotted something. His gloved hand came down and grabbed a blue needle.

""One of Sonic's quills. He was here.""

He muttered to himself, before bringing up his communicator.

""Egg Memo: I am experiencing a heightened sense of aggression and blood lust that is atypical from my normal attitude. Scanning the area indicates the remnant of some sort of energy, the half life systems indicate that this originated at the same time as Sonic's entrance to this place. I theorize that whatever this energy is, that it sent Sonic into a frenzy which ended with his demise. Will have to study this some more, to confirm my theory.""

He moved further along the coast, finding a ragged beach umbrella that had been blown away by a blast, as indicated by the scorch marks. He moved it around and saw a label upon it which said 'Property of Mario'.

""And now we have a new name, we'll have to investigate. SAGE! Have you accessed this universe's internet, yet?""

He questioned, as a red light flickered in front of him. It soon took the image of a young girl,

""It appears that this world is not as developed as our own, Father. The satellite network here is sorely lacking. That being said, Father, someone attempted to hack into my systems. I have isolated the intruding code.""

Eggman's eyes narrowed, not at all liking that. He glanced over at Metal Sonic,

""Investigate the island. I want to know if we're being watched!"" With that, Metal Sonic disappeared from view, ""As for you Sage, upload that code into an external hard drive, before eradicating it from your system with extreme prejudice! I'll decompress it and review it's intent on a private system, not connected to the Eggnet at all. Last thing we need is to accidentally release a trojan . . . not that my firewalls couldn't handle it, mind you.""

Moments later Metal Sonic returned, reporting that he had not seen anyone.

""Interesting.""

Eggman muttered to himself as he glanced back over at the data reading of the initial energy signature. He wondered if it also carried a virus with the same effect that it had upon humans.

""We've found everything we can here, let's head home!""

He announced as he got onto his Egg Mobile.

Once he was back to base, the Mad Scientist began to issue out orders. He was like a man possessed, as if the drive had returned back to him with a vengeance!

""SAGE! Contact Fang and his gang and send the Warp Topaz to him! I want him to investigate that Universe and get me word on this Mario character. I want to know everything about him! Cubot, contact Infinite and see if he's out of physical therapy, yet! Orbot, contact the Babylon Rogues I need them to get a chaos emerald for me! AND WILL ANYONE TELL ME WHERE STONE IS WITH MY COFFEE!""

He shouted as he he marched into his own private office. His headquarters breathing with more life than it had in months. The factories were back on at full capacity, his creations rushing down the hall to fulfill their duty.

All the while Eggman pulls out a laptop. He ensured that it was not connected to any network before putting in the flash drive. He copied over the data and decompressed it, scrolling down as he read over the code.

His eyes narrowed.

He recognized it.

He had seen it time after time after time from Metal Sonic's own code. It was was what gave Metal Sonic his bloodlust and hatred towards Sonic. Of course, this wasn't a carbon copy of Metal Sonic's own line of code, it was unique.

""Hmm.""

He leaned back in his chair, taking in this new information. A virus that created aggression and an energy that had done it to. A fight that took place with Sonic and possibly a being named Mario. Was it possible here that Mario was another victim?

Yes.

Mario had to have been the intended target, if he was there.

Which meant that Sonic was kidnapped and transplanted into that universe, used as a weapon against this Mario . . . and Sonic was the one that lost.

"" . . . ""

\---

Weeks had passed since that day.

The Eggman Empire was stronger than ever, finally recovering from the last debacle against Sonic and the Resistance. The army was at its full might, running at 100 percent capacity. The mechs had been polished and fully modernized. They had even managed to collect the chaos emeralds, among some other artifacts. It seemed that guarding them had become quite lax after Eggman's grief fueled sabbatical.

Everything was coming together swimmingly, and the last piece that Eggman needed was from Fang.

""Report!"" The Mad Scientist demanded as he loomed over the purple jeroba. Fang for his part didn't flinch, though he did visibly look nervous.

""Alroight, well Oi got what y'wanted! Schmoozed up t'the populace an' all that jazz. So Oi know lot 'bout Mario, he's bit of a local hero. Savin' some sorta Princess from Bowser, an' stoppin' Bowser from takin' over  th' Mushroom Kingdom, or stoppin' Bowser from tryin' t'rule the Galaxy. An' fightin' Bowser on Bowser's weddin' day. That really is a lot of it . . . that he fights Bowser a lot, usually t'save that Peach girl.""

Eggman twirled his mustache as he took in those statements.

It all fit in with his current theory. That someone manipulated Mario and Sonic into fighting, and Bowser was the prime suspect for such an action. He accordingly had the resources to try and take over the Universe at one point in time, which meant that he had the resources for this plan as well.

""And what do you know of this Bowser creature?""

Fang gulped as he leaned back, resting upon his tail.

""Crikey . . . well, he's a King, I think. Rules over the Koopa Kingdom, nobody Oi talked t'liked him. He's a big bully in their eyes, kind o'like ya . . . Oi mean, not at all like ya! A-anyways, the last Oi heard of him was that he was makin' some sort of theme park.""

Eggman smashed his hand into the wall, leaving a fist sized dent into the metal.

""He goes out and gets /my/ rival killed and then he goes ahead and builds an amusement park! Where does this so called king get off! The only one who should be killing Sonic is me! The only one that should be celebrating and creating Eggman Land is me! I swear . . . when I get my hands on him!""

He stepped out of his office,

""Sage! Prepare the Eggman Fleet! We are going to war!""

\---

""Gotta admit, Wiz, I was kind of worried there. I thought he was going to figure out about us!"" Boomstick laughed as he leaned against the wall, cracking open a beer. He glanced over at his friend who was currently typing away on his keyboard.

""I'm more annoyed that my hack failed than anything. I should've known that Robotnik would have his own custom programming language. Wonder if there is a guide book about it, or if I'll just have to learn from trial and error."" He muttered to himself.

Boomstick chuckled and slapped Wiz on the back,""Don't worry 'bout that now! Let's just go and make sure that Bowser is prepared! We don't want ol' King Koopa to get caught with his pants down!""

""Right, right! We have to get Bowser ready, or else we won't have a proper Death Battle on our hands.""",18,1731701719.0,deathbattle,5,1.0,False

1gs5hrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlternateHistory/comments/1gs5hrj/what_if_cleopatra_and_antony_had_won_the_battle/,What if Cleopatra and Antony had won the Battle of Actium?,"The Battle of Actium was really the first and last battle of consequence in the final civil war of the republic. 

The skirmish outside Alexandria by the Hippodrome a year later only slowed Octavian down for a day. There was no hope of victory. 

I won’t go into a recap of the battle but it ended with Antony and Cleopatra breaking Octavians blockade of the Ambracian gulf thus securing her massive treasury and the core of the heavy warships. 

The rest of the navy was meant to disengage and follow. The massive but disease ridden land army was meant to make its way to Egypt or possibly Antioch, on foot. 

Both were captured. 

In my alternate history, 16 year old Caesarion recklessly arrives unlooked for with the Ptolemaic internal army and fleet that worked within Egypt.  His arrival is cinematically just as Cleopatra’s squadron has broken through Octavian’s center and opened its sails. 

Caesarion descends on Octavian’s rear as Cleopatra’s heavy ships turn round and follow suit. Antony, instead of abandoning his flagship for Cleopatra’s, abandons it to rejoin his land forces. 

Hilarity ensues. 

Jk jk. I imagine such a reversal would win the day for Cleopatra, hopefully killing or capturing Agrippa, without losing Caesarion or Antony. Agrippa was too damn good and would need to go to secure the future since Antony wasn’t on the same level strategically or tactically. 

Anyway, from there the future is bright. In my head, Caesarion and Antony invade Italy. I think with Caesarion at her side even Cleopatra could be present since she could now remind the populace of her connection to their beloved Caesar in his true heir. 

But here my revision gets fantastical. Antony dismantles Rome’s empire into independent republics:

- Italy/Rome
- Gaul. Which could be split in two to remain powerful enough to check Rome. I imagine a reinvigorated Massalia.
-  Sardinia, Corsica
-  Spain

I imagine Antony turning Sicily into his personal kingdom to be inherited by Antyllus.

North Africa - Mauritania, Numidia, Carthage - would be divided into client kingdoms similarly to actual history. 

The Ptolemaic Kingdom would now include Greece and Asia, possibly annexing the treacherous client kingdoms of Anatolia. It would effectively be the eastern Mediterranean from Greece and Cyrenaica to Armenia. 

I imagine Caesarion would be 18 by the end of the conquest of Italy and truly rule jointly with Cleopatra. 

Ok coffee’s done and I’m off.
