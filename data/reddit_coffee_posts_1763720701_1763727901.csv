Hey, I’m 32 and based in Osaka, enjoying life in a city full of energy and culture. I speak English, French, and Arabic, and I’m still learning Japanese—so maybe you can be my teacher, or perhaps my partner in something more fun. I’m open to meeting casually first: coffee, drinks, or exploring hidden corners of the city. If the chemistry feels right, I’m happy to see where attraction naturally takes us. I love playful banter, teasing conversations, and the thrill of discovering sparks. I’m glad to share pics before we meet, so you’ll know who’s making you smile.",1,1763727739.0,r4r,1,1.0,True

To be honest I’m feeling okay since I’ve got money that I don’t rush to spend since I have no idea when I will be able to start making money in a healthy manner, but I’m not restricting myself either. Today I bought a coffee, something to eat and tobacco since I’m a smoker disgracefully.
Right now I actually taking things in my hands and I’m getting ready to get my docs in check.
I honestly was living without the documents since I had no idea what I needed them for. Nobody has ever informed me that I had the right to get economically helped by the state, not even the people that were fully informed and receiving the help. I don’t know why they kept quiet. Maybe not to judge me or because they didn’t want to see me doing well. But it doesn’t matter, I don’t blame them. Even though this thought pops up once in a while when n my head.
At the end one has to do everything by herself but it’s ok.
Anyways, I have the right to live a normal life so I will get it. I don’t dream of boats and luxury parties anymore. Honestly I’ve been to some and I never felt good being there so I would drink myself unconscious because it was pretty on the outside but those places usually had the most toxic vibes that I’ve ever seen. It really depends on the context, not judging boats or the luxury, but if it’s a place where the book “girls” it has usually nothing good behind it.
I just want to be able to have a roof over my head, food in my fridge, a stable job that I’m good at and access to the university. Maybe one day I’ll meet the love of my life but honestly from all this trauma I can’t even look men in the eyes nowdays.
Another minus of sex work is that you get disgusted my any man who tries to love you. I’ve had several men try to get with me but I’m disgusted by the fact that they even imagine me without anything on or the fact that I would have to get in bed with them. FOR FREE.
To be honest a fact that not every client would like to read is that during that whole process I hated sex and I still do. I find it disgusting and that’s why I would blur do it for money. Everything that you would see was a mask. A role. I remember lying to my last client how much I’m enjoying sex and how necessary and fun it was for me. It’s so funny. I realised what a good actress I could be if I really need it. 🤣
I have not enjoyed the act. Not one single time.
I stopped enjoying sex since the day that my ex fiancee has raped me while he was high on drugs. I’ve totally shut down after that day.
I’m sorry.

Hi! I’m looking for a dedicated writing partner for a slow-burn story in 3rd person, where replies are usually 3–5 sentences. The goal is a gradual, tension-filled dynamic between two characters whose personalities clash but evolve over time. I write on Discord.

Scene Setup:
The story begins in a cozy, slightly run-down bookstore in a small town. The bookstore owner, organized and introverted, prides themselves on a quiet, calm space for readers. Recently, the shop has added a small coffee counter run by a new barista, whose energetic and messy style clashes with the owner’s orderly routines. The two meet on the first morning the barista arrives: the barista is setting up their station while the owner nervously checks inventory, already irritated by the noise and smell of coffee. Both characters are immediately frustrated with each other, and the tension sets the stage for slow-developing interactions.

Opening scene :

The bell above the shop door jingled far louder than it should have in a place meant for quiet, and (your name here) winced at the sound. She stood behind the front counter with a clipboard tucked under her arm, double-checking inventory while trying to ignore the sudden hiss of the espresso machine warming up. The smell of coffee, rich and intrusive, drifted through the aisles of old paper and dust—an unwelcome guest filling the shop faster than the morning light. She cast a wary glance toward (my name here), the new barista, who was unpacking supplies with noisy enthusiasm, scattering napkins and metal tins across the counter as though chaos were simply part of the job. Jaw tightening, she cleared her throat. “Could you… maybe keep it down a bit? Some of us open the shop quietly.”


Story Goals:
The focus is on how these two very different people navigate sharing the space, their misunderstandings, arguments, and gradual respect. The progression is meant to be slow and detailed, showing character growth and the subtle shifts in their relationship.

If this setup interests you, please message me! I’m looking for someone ready to explore the dynamic and develop the story organically.",1,1763727535.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,0.99,False

I really hope it’s okay to post this. I read through the rules before posting and I don’t think I’m breaking any, I’m really sorry if I do. 

I’ve been a stay at home mum for a long time, and hadn’t worked in nearly 20 years (since I was a teenager). I Was diagnosed earlier this year with autism and adhd. My family of four have been living off my husbands income forever but it’s just not sustainable anymore, our finances are so bad we never have more than $100 in savings and it’s always gone by the end of each pay week. 

I’ve spent the last year and a half getting my official diagnosis (after suspecting for years), so I could try to access some government funded disability support, like a disability employment service and access to more mental health care and support. I was rejected because apparently I don’t need enough support because I’ve “managed” 30-something years without it?

Anyway, I decided to try to get a job on my own. I have a little experience in retail, ideally I would’ve liked to try packing or stacking shelves or something with minimal human interaction but I kept getting rejected. So I resorted to applying at fast food places. More rejections, then finally I got an interview at pretty popular fast food chain. The interview was three weeks ago. 

The manager liked me and called me in for a second interview, and the next day they offered me the job. They said I would be starting on registers and packing orders, then drive thru, then frying/kitchen, and eventually hoping to work up to a day shift manager. 

First shift on Monday evening, packing orders and taking a few orders at the counter, and cashing a few drive thru orders, learning the registers and what items come in what meal. It was a lot to handle, but I coped okay and thought, yep shouldn’t take long to get used to this, in a couple of weeks I think I’ll feel much more at ease. 

Second shift on Wednesday, more of the same, except triple as busy. But I still coped okay and started feeling more confident in what I had already learned and less intimidated by what I still had left to learn, but struggled to function at home after. Didn’t seem to be able to speak to my husband or kids at all for the rest of the night. 

Third shift on Thursday…. They put me on drive thru. With a headset. During peak dinner rush. My trainer goofed and didn’t follow the bosses instructions with having me only on drive thru for the night, my trainer threw me out at the front counter, as well as expected me to be aware and responding to cars approaching the drive thru. 
Boss told my trainer off and sent me back to the drive thru. 

Along with my autism, I have to deal with auditory processing disorder. I had to ask every customer in the drive thru to repeat themselves at least twice, sometimes even more. When ordering a roast chicken meal one meanie goes “A LEG PIECE, GENIUS!” after I said “I’m so sorry, I’m learning, would you mind repeating that one more time?” But I didn’t even freak out at the rudeness. I brushed it off and moved on (very unlike me)

But the noise. Every time I misheard or couldn’t hear a customer, my brain would scream louder and louder. By the end of my shift I was having to squeeze my shoulders into my chest to stop my whole body shaking and bite the insides of my cheeks to stop from crying every time I saw a car approach the speaker. I felt more and more like I was going to vomit or fall to the ground with each customer. 

Then the boss told me that as of next week, I’ll be doing all of it (for longer shifts) and won’t have a trainer. There will be one other person around to help but I would be expected to be able to serve customers at the front checkout (using a register I’m obviously not very familiar with at all and have no idea yet what each meal includes when people ask “what can I get with a roast and vegetables or what packs come with fried chicken and mash potato, sweet potato and peas or whatever else), pack those orders, keep track of and pack uber online orders and hand them out to the drivers assigned to that order (there can be up to 7 different orders and uber drivers at a time) take, cash, pack and hand out drive thru orders all while this headset is screaming in my ear constantly and my brain is screaming even louder. AND learning all the cleaning jobs around the restaurant as well and learning when and how they need to be done and coordinating that amongst all the serving at two different spots and packing and internal screaming. 

I walked out the door at the end of my shift to where my husband was parked waiting to take me home and just cried. This was 9.15pm last night. It’s now 9.17pm the following night and I’ve not stopped crying since for longer than 20 minutes at a time. 

All last night I kept waking myself up crying in my sleep. Woke up this morning with instant fear of going back tonight for my next shift. Not just dread of having to go to work, full on fear and feeling like if I walk into that building again I’ll die. 

Did what I had to do to get my kids off to school, came home and had a coffee with my sister, then she went home and I sat on my couch for a couple of hours and tried to play my comfort game. Ended up just staring at a wall for ages. 

Some loud noise outside snapped me back to present. I got up to see what happened and saw on the clock that it was only 5 hours until I had to go back. I started screaming and fell to the floor. The last thing I remember is messaging my sister to say please help me. Next thing I know she’s there with me wiping my face with a cold cloth and holding a huge pile of my hair. She said she had been there for a while before I actually seemed to notice her and stop scream-crying. She found me on my chair rocking and screaming and clawing at my arms with a bunch of my hair ripped out all over me and the floor.

She stayed with me a while and I eventually started to calm down a bit but when she asked if I thought it will get easier in time, I started screaming again don’t make me go back don’t make me go back. She just said okay, I think you need to message your boss. 

After a bit when I could actually use my hands properly again I messaged my boss and apologised for wasting her time but I don’t think I can come back as I’m not coping. She said no worries and wished me well. But I still just keep crying. 

The panic or whatever the heck that was today has eased, I still have this overwhelming feeling of wanting to go home (even though I am home??)  the last three weeks are such a blur. I’ve only ever experienced a panic that intense once before right after my mum died, and even that wasn’t as bad as this was. It was the most horrible thing I’ve ever experienced. 

I have no idea what I’m hoping to accomplish with this post. Validation? Advice maybe? Will it be like this with any job or was this type of job just incompatible with my mental health or whatever? I just want to help provide for our kids and keep a roof over our heads. Now I feel like everything’s completely hopeless. That because of me we will never stop struggling financially because I can’t figure out how to function like everyone else. ",1,1763727264.0,AutisticAdults,0,0.67,False

For those not in the know, these are deals where you pay a one-time fee for lifetime access to a piece of software. It’s a fantastic way to keep your overheads low, especially when you're starting out. But like anything that sounds too good to be true, there are pitfalls. I’ve seen my fair share of them, and I've learned a few things along the way.​

First off, not all LTDs are created equal. I've seen deals that have paid for themselves a hundred times over, and I've seen deals that have disappeared into the ether, taking my money with them. The key is to know how to spot the difference. One of the first things I do is look at the team behind the software. Are they active on social media? Do they have a public roadmap? A company that's transparent about its plans is a company that's likely to stick around.​

Another thing I’ve learned is to be wary of deals that seem *too* good. A lifetime deal for a brand new, unproven piece of software that promises to solve all your problems for the price of a coffee? That’s a red flag for me. I’d much rather pay a bit more for a tool that has a proven track record, even if the lifetime deal isn't as cheap. I also make a point of checking out reviews from other users. Not just the testimonials on the sales page, but genuine, in-depth reviews on blogs and forums.​

But when you find a good one, man, it’s a beautiful thing. I've got tools in my arsenal that I bought years ago for a one-time fee, and they're still bringing in value every single day. They’ve scaled with my business, and I've never had to pay another cent for them. It's like having a secret weapon in your back pocket.​

So what's your take? Have you had any big wins with LTDs? Or any horror stories? I'd love to hear your experiences.​",1,1763726881.0,SaaS,1,1.0,False

I'm a uni student who needs to wake up in the morning to study.   
Throughout all my life, I was never an early bird and when i was younger my dad literally had to shake me to wake me up.   
  
During university everything just got worse. I'm doing electronic engineering and during finals month I always get devoured by stress and anxiety, so much so that last year I completely fucked up my body by giving me a mental breakdown and a burnout, since i was waking up around midday and studying 'till 3am. 

At some point I realized that i needed to sleep more. So I stopped looking at my phone before going to sleep, stopped having milk-based products for dinner, started getting in bed around 10/11pm.  
Results: I literally stay in bed awake for hours, while my brain is eating me alive by constantly saying stuff like: ""Yeah, you didnt do everything you planned to do today"", ""Look at the time, you only have 5 hours of sleep now"" , ""Finals are coming, are you ready?"" and all of this stupid shit. 

I tried everything and I mean EVERYTHING. Melatonin kinda works, but I need a lot of it. Tried to stop drinking coffee, I feel like shit all day.   
The only thing that works are edibles, since my brain just shut down and i can collapse from  the tireness. I sleep like 10h and i wake up fresh and ready. But i dont want to depend on weed to sleep.

After all of this, I tried to **force** myself to wake up in the morning, no matter what. Putting the alarm far away, setting multiple alarms, tried sleep cycles alarms. They work for a couple of weeks, then I literally shut them down WHILE IM SLEEPING. One time I was sleeping at a friend house and he witnessed me PUNCHING MY PHONE TO TURN OFF THE ALARM WHILE SLEEPING.

I really really reallly need help. I cant go on like this, everyday i feel like shit all day and cant function properly. I lose a lot of time just because I need to sleep. What will I do when I work a 9-5? Tell my boss i cant come? Please I really want to change this part of myself.

I’m planning a trip to Beijing with a group of 10–12 friends (we’re all 23–26) and I’m trying to figure out the best area to stay in. We’re looking for a good mix of:

* youth culture
* nightlife
* walkable food/coffee spots
* safety
* easy access to major attractions
* somewhere that’s foreigner-friendly (we are all black)

Right now I’m leaning heavily towards **Sanlitun** because it seems like the main hotspot for nightlife, restaurants, and modern Beijing energy. Taikoo Li looks like a vibe. But I’m also curious about the **Houhai / Shichahai** or **Nanluoguxiang** areas since they seem to have more traditional hutong atmosphere.

For anyone who knows Beijing well:

1. Where would you recommend a big group of young adults stay for the best overall experience?  
2. Is Sanlitun the move, or is there another area we should consider?

It really hurt me especially since I feel like I do everything for them and care about her kid a lot. I know it’s not my kid by blood and so I don’t have the same rights but I feel like I deserve to be there when he wakes up and he’s jumping to open presents, getting hot cocoa or coffee and watch him be so happy and I don’t get why she thinks I shouldn’t get that privilege. Idk to me it’s just not the same as when you wake up on Christmas compared to later in the day. I also don’t really understand why she would even say that or not want me there?

1p2wuwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1p2wuwx/ultimate_hack_tell_them_theyre_not_christian/,Ultimate hack: Tell them they're not Christian,"So. I was raised like many here in an extremely conservative  Christian community in a very conservative Christian state.

Recently I went back to visit and was getting coffee with an old friend in a cafe in the morning. Unbeknownst to me, the café was also a meeting place of an evangelical Christian group. But whatever, no big deal right? I lived among these people my whole life and learned to tolerate their arrogance and pride.

So we're getting coffee and talking about the good old days and a couple women from the church are saying hi to him because I guess they're all regulars and it's not that huge of a city. 

So we've been there for a bit and a couple of the women ask to sit at our table. I'm kind of annoyed because I don't have much time to chill with my friend as I only come back to visit once a year, but again. Whatever. So they sit at the table. Now we're doing the normal chat ""where did you move, what do you do there etc."" and then one makes a comment about the Gay and trans agenda... 


Now... My friend and I have a friend who killed himself in high school because he was gay. Nobody knew it at the time. It came out after he killed himself. And nobody would've guessed this kid was gay either (he was 16 when he did it) 

All the years of my rage  against  these religious bigots came out at once, but in a way I didn't expect. But it had great results. I told the woman straight up ""I don't think you're a Christian"". And my friend is kind of like ""whoa whoa"" but I'm laser focused on this woman and taking her down now. And she's locked on to me. And she's like ""I know God bla bla. who are you to say?!"" and the usual nonsense. And I just continue. Using all of their words against them. There was no need to argue about their pride as a deadly sin or the Bible. I told her she needed to let Jesus into her heart. And repent. And asked if she wanted to go to hell. She basically called me sick and angry and she and her friend got up from the table and left. 

I consider this a very easy win and I've got into many arguments over the years but all it took was using their own words against them to finally get them to shut up. 

So in summary. Just say you're a Christian when dealing with these people and tell them to repent or let Jesus into their hearts. They take this as very aggressive, but it's no more aggressive than what they do. You're literally using identical language and it can stop them on their tracks and make them rage quit.

1p2wtbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lincolnshire/comments/1p2wtbi/location_location_location/,"Location, location, location","Hi guys, 

I'll be spending the next year or so commuting into the Retford/Worksop area for a fixed-term contract. I need to be on site for about two or three says a week. Currently based in Kent, so we're going to have to move, I think: commuting in from here is just not realistic.

We are a family of two, both in our 40s. Not terribly keen on nightlife and the big city buzz.  
  
What matters to us, as a family, is, in order of priority:  
\- Access to nice areas to walk/cycle in (walking for my wife, road cycling for me)  
\- A fairly quick and uncongested road to Retford for me; access to public transport for my wife.  
\- Security  
\- A squash club nearby  
\- Would be great to be within walking distance from a nice, friendly coffee shop and, perhaps, something like a small Tesco/Sainsbury.  
\- Access to open water (the sea or a river etc.)  
\- Reasonable distance from a town centre of some sort for when the mood takes us (not often)

With this in mind, could you please help me understand which areas would you be looking at, within, say, a 50 mile distance from Retford?

We only want a one-bed, max two-bed, nothing fancy.

Thank you!

1p2wioy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_mrs_freed/comments/1p2wioy/i_think_i_physically_assaulted_my_sleep_paralysis/,I think I physically assaulted my sleep paralysis demon.,"I (30f) never Reddit, stuff isn't interesting enough in my life to share in my opinion. But I had a very interesting morning. 

     So typically, I put my daughter to sleep, get some house work done, then go to sleep myself before my husband goes to work. But lately I've been able to just go to bed at the same time I get our daughter to sleep. Feels like I'm getting more hours of sleep and waking up early has felt easier. 

     Yesterday morning, I wake up to my husbands alarm, got up, made his coffee and see him off before I go back to bed. Our daughter is 4 and still cosleeps with us most nights. So I go to bed after I take her for a potty break and she goes back to sleep. I'm having a hard time though. Usually I do some sudoku and fall back to sleep. But I'm on my period and feeling a little extra crappy. So I end up tossing and turning until I finally get that slightly awkward position that just feels right. I'm on my side with my head tilted up just a little with a pillow between my knees and both sides of it are cold. (I normal just fall asleep on my back and I don't move much in my sleep) 

     I guess my brain is finally relaxing and going into REM because I start to feel my bed sway from head to feet. As if someone were under the mattress alternating lifts at each end. I feel the head end go up, then as it goes down, I feel the foot end of the mattress go up then down. This goes back and forth as I'm drifting to sleep. SUDDENLY, my side of the mattress is complete lifted, I feel my body lifting and rolling like someone was looking between the mattress and the box spring on my side of the bed and didn't care that I was there. My eyes adjust in the darkness and I clearly see my side of this mattress going up. 

     I feel two hands pulling it up, and I slam my mattress back down and am met with this human like figure right on my side, we are face to face, not even a full foot apart, and my eyes adjust more to see they have some kind of sheet over their head. I'm in fight or flight by now, I feel my daughter behind me, still sleeping, and I grab this figure by the head. And lift them up. This is a whole person, but they feel almost weightless. I can't sit my whole body up, but I get them in a hold and try turning my lamps on. 

     We have those lamps that you just touch and the have 3 levels of brightness before turning them off. I'm touching both lamps and they won't turn on, while also trying not to loss my grip on this person. I can start to see more and more. Like my eyes are adjusting beyond just seeing shapes in the darkness, I can see the creases of the sheet used to cover their entire head,. I start raising my voice, repeating ""who the f*** are you, why are you in my house, why wont my lights turn on, who are you, what do you want!?"" In the middle of all of this, I pull the sheet off their face. 

     I can see her... An old, almost decrepit, wicked looking woman. She has pale greyish skin, eyes that shine like a dark honey color from a very dim Hugh light I have no idea where it's coming from, she's smirking for a second after I pull the sheet off her face, then she stops and we are making eye contact. Her old, fried hair is long and I can feel it on the back of my hands while I'm holding her by the neck with both of my hands. Keeping her a safe distance from the side of the bed my daughter is on. I can feel her jaw move while she is trying to speak, but I can't hear her. I'm asking over and over why she is here and how she got in. Right as I start to hear sound come from her mouth, her weight starts to increase, my wrist almost not being able to support the grasp I had on her, I start feeling her get closer, her eyes getting more sinister, and her face starts to distort, almost like she is trying to shape shift and overcome me in some way. Then right as I'm about to make out what she is trying to say, I speak over her involuntarily, ""GET OUT OF MY HOUSE"" and at the same time, I open my eyes and Im back in the same position I was in before I felt the sway of the bed. 

     I woke up... I had been asleep the entire time I was, I guess fighting, this old woman. I sit up fast, turn on my lamps, and check on my daughter. She is sound asleep, on the other side of her is my 16 year old dog who always lays right next to her after my husband goes to work. Breathing normal and hasn't moved from her position since going back to sleep. I called my husband, told him about this very vivid and physical dream, and even tried looking some stuff up. 

     Now, I knew about the sleep hag being one of the paralysis ""demons"" that many people would see when going through sleep paralysis. When I was younger and going through high school, I had a few experiences with sleep paralysis where I would see an old  woman, covered in a thin black clothe, but she was always standing in the corner of the room. Not at my bed, or on my chest as many stories have said they experience this specific ""entity"" sitting on their chest, causing their breathing to feel heavy and more difficult. She had never gotten that close until one night, her hands come from a black mist that appeared over me, they were old, wrinkles at every joint, thin, and very long. With unkempt long pointed nails, and sickly greyish skin, I was screaming, but not even a whisper came out, I tried moving at least one finger, until I could regain control and I gripped my bed, pulled myself up and was able to scream and she would just vanish. Ive mentioned this experience maybe 3 or 4 times in my life after, and it never happened again. Well, I guess I finally got to get her back. Yesterday was the first time in like 12 years I saw her, was able to see her face, and I almost got her to speak. I still remember the feeling of her neck in my hands, her weight on my wrists, her stringy, dry grey hair on my hands and between my fingers. I remember pulling the starched cloth off her face, like she had a brand new bed sheet covering her. It was all real, my body felt like I had just been in a fight. I had the b**ch in my hand's. 

     My husband called me back after maybe an hour, checked on me to see if I had tried to go back to sleep or if anything else happened, because before I realized it was all a dream, I really thought some old woman got into my house, hid under my bed, and waited for me to go to sleep to get out and do whatever. thankfully it was just a dream, and I might need to work on some stress and maybe trauma? I don't know. Anyways, I told my husband that I'm fine, said a few prayers for my house and my family, and I may have mentioned that I'm leaving the lamp on the dimmest setting so I can see the b**ch entirely next time. 

     My home feels the same. I don't feel any negative energy and I did a full deep clean with a little prayer in each room when I got up for the day. I feel like I wasfvisably exhausted though. My mom checked on me several times. She lives next door and of course I went to her house and told her about my little sleep paralysis reunion. she actually suggested I share with Reddit because she listens to creepy Reddit stories a lot and maybe someone will have a similar experience. Anyways, I hope it wasnt too long, or boring. Thanks for listening. ",1,1763725581.0,u_mrs_freed,0,1.0,False

It’s been some month since last time I updated about this, I live rushed and hadn’t the full time to put my hands to this at once, so I did like a bit every day.

Here’s a bit of the process… Printed, sanded, coated, painted. Can be done MUCH better but wanted to check how it looks and feels overall. I’ll correct the finish details for the next one haha

Its printed in PETG, 5 walls, 40% infill (though there are very few parts with infill)

It doesn’t has a hole/s for cables coming from the lights, I’ll do that with a drill bit or a solder in the more convenient place after tightening all the screws

I did with my father an inox reinforcement to take the load of holding the subchasis together

I did the plate holder custom because the Chinese bs I bought got the threads damaged.

The small piece between the tail and the plate holder is also custom, printed in TPU so it works a bit as a dampener

 

Hope I’m not missing anything, feel free to ask. I’m also open to do lil modification if any of you have a special requirement for your bike.

 

Yes, I’ll upload the file and put a link for buying a coffee those who want to help a lil bit

Back in India, our “pantry” was basically one kettle, a jar of instant coffee that nobody refilled, and a few tea bags that tasted like sadness. If someone brought biscuits, it was treated like a festival.

Then I walked into my first Singapore office pantry  and I swear it felt like entering a mini café. There were different types of coffee, a proper machine that hissed like it meant business, shelves of snacks, Milo packets, sparkling water, cereal dispensers, even oat milk. OAT. MILK.

People here don’t just grab a drink and go. They have entire routines. One colleague has a “morning kopi ritual” where he stands at the coffee machine like a barista. Another person brings their own matcha whisk. Someone else has a secret snack drawer they refill every week like they’re running a convenience store from their desk.

And every office seems to have that one person who treats the pantry like their personal living room. They chat there, take calls, eat lunch, refill snacks, wipe counters, give life advice  it’s like they’ve become the unofficial “pantry manager.”

Slowly, I’ve become one of them. I go there for a break, make a drink, have a random conversation, or just stand there staring into the fridge like it’s going to reveal the meaning of life. It’s weirdly comforting.

Now I understand why people say the pantry is the heart of a Singapore office. Work happens everywhere else but the real bonding, gossip, and therapy sessions? Always in the pantry.",1,1763725047.0,indiansinsingapore,2,0.6,False

I’m **Moonah Celeste**, a variety VTuber who focuses on **story-based games, narrative adventures, and chaotic-but-cozy streams** with the Cowmoonity.

A little about me:  
✨ I started mostly with cozy games → but story games absolutely stole my heart, to the point where we are now playing also Horror games with a strong story!   
🎮 Recently I finished FNAF: *Secret of the Mimic*, Silent Hill 2, and Little Nightmares 3  
💫 My theme is “cosmic cow” and Barista with fresh coffee, sparkles, chaos and kindness!  
Our Stream Motto is right now "" Spread Love, Kindness and Headshots!""  
🌟 I’m currently upgrading my Design to 2.0→  to a version with **crystal horns + a glowing halo** (my first lore arc!)   
🐄 My community is lovingly called the **Cowmoonity**… and yes, I fully encourage cow puns

Since I want to be more active here again, I thought I’d show my model + say hiiii 👋  
I’d also love to get to know more VTubers and viewers around here.

**Question for everyone:**  
What’s a story-based game (cozy OR spooky) that left a big impact on you?  
I want to play more Games that leave my mind blown and my palms sweaty as i get through the next Level. IF you suggest horror games, please make sure they are not too Gorey, as i usually look at 16+ Games :) !

I’ll drop my Twitch link in the comments so I don’t anger the Reddit gods. 💫

1p2w8f9,https://www.reddit.com/r/KongDotAIChatbotAgent/comments/1p2w8f9/the_training_trap_why_your_ai_should_work_for_you/,"The Training Trap: Why Your AI Should Work for You, Not the Other Way Around","We created AI to save time, yet we’ve normalized spending weeks configuring it. It’s like buying a microwave that requires a thermodynamics course before reheating your coffee.  
  
The Emperor's New Complexity  
In many companies, “AI training” becomes its own project i.e. teams, spreadsheets, meetings, and months of setup. The enthusiasm fades into quiet resentment. If your AI needs weeks of training before it’s useful, it’s not as intelligent as advertised. We’ve forced users to become amateur data scientists for basic functionality.  
  
When Did Simple Become Radical?  
Software was meant to make life easier, but AI tools now demand more cognitive overhead than the problems they solve. Real innovation is removing complexity, building systems that understand context without requiring it in seventeen formats, and working with what you already have. Simple isn’t unsophisticated, simple is hard.  
  
The Mythology of Training  
There’s a narrative that more training equals better results. Often, it’s an excuse for poor design. Yes, specialized models need training, but for answering questions or scheduling appointments, why should AI need months when humans don’t? The assumption that AI must be trained extensively is often just bad product design disguised as necessity.  
  
What “Just Works” Looks Like  
Imagine uploading your docs, connecting your channels, and the AI works within minutes. No spreadsheets, no data scientists, no three-month roadmap. This is what happens when AI is built around user needs. Speed matters because delayed value is diminished value.  
  
Reducing Work, Not Redistributing It  
If implementation requires new staff, new skills, and workflow changes, is it really saving work? Often, we automate the easy part and complicate everything else. True utility means the tool adapts to you and your existing processes.  
  
The False Choice  
We’ve been told to choose between weeks of training for customization or generic bots that barely function. But there’s a third option: systems that are powerful, accessible, understand nuance, and deliver value immediately.  
  
What This Means for You  
If your AI project has its own project manager and people are learning Python to configure it, you’re in the trap. Ask yourself: do you want a perfect system in six months or a working one in six minutes?  
  
The Shift  
Early AI tools reflected the complexity of their creators. Now the question is: how can the technology serve? Winners will be companies that make sophistication invisible and respect users’ time. Speed is a philosophy: AI should adapt to human workflow, not the other way around.  
  
Conclusion: Choose Different  
When someone sells you an AI that needs weeks of training, ask: why? Why should software need more time to learn than humans? Good AI works now or admits it can’t. The future isn’t more training, it’s no training. AI should finally deliver on its original promise: making things easier.",1,1763724621.0,KongDotAIChatbotAgent,0,1.0,False

Looking for: Minimal mess, easy workflow, and aesthetic/build quality. Don’t plan to change out burrs or get too fancy.

Overthinker and new to espresso. Overwhelmed with options. At this point, I’d like to buy once, cry once within reason. Was originally going to get the DF64 gen2, but kept reading about static and quality issues. Minimal mess, workflow, and admittedly aesthetic/build quality are most important to me. That lead me to the Lagom Casa, which also looks a lot better. However, now I’m thinking a GBW is the way to go since I tend to finish one bag before going to the next one. So now I’m looking at the All Ground Sense grinder, but that thing looks hefty and large for my counter space. 

Love that the lagom casa is more compact, but will the single dosing/RDT/cleaning going to feel like a hassle over time? Should I just get over how big the all ground sense is and get that? Any other grinders to consider? Those who have used both single dosing and hopper: in terms of work flow, is it a huge upgrade with the hopper? 

Eureka mignon Libra 65AP, specialita, and oro/oro xl are other options that I think can work, but feel overwhelmed with trying to compare. Zerno looks nice, but likely much more than what I need and will be more of a luxury addition.

Does FIRE have to be binary? Can I one day getup and live a FIRED life? Other than finances - what steps I need to take today for FIRE !

In my opinion one of the biggest changes which will happen with FIRE is that the goals shift dramatically from being extrinsic to intrinsic. But Living an intentional life isn't easy. The biggest challenges aren't external obstacles, but internal !

So the realization is that I need a transition plan from my current life to a FIREd life. Its not going to be easy to change mindset of past many years of from the fixed, finite target of the FIRE number to the infinite, evolving process of building a purposeful, structured, and meaningful life.

 So I did the following

1. Understanding - Fired up my fav gen ai and looked up different aspects that I matter
2. Action Plan - What steps I would take to help transition to that life. These actions will be different for each of us! And like with any transition this is something which would make sense when we are about to cross over to the other side in my case I see this plan for next couple years.

1p2vr4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1p2vr4h/just_some_random_local_tips_for_traveling_in/,Just some random local tips for traveling in Korea (from a local),"Hey everyone, I’m a local living in Korea.  
I’m using Gemini to translate this, so the English might sound a little off, but I wanted to drop some random tips for anyone planning to visit. If you guys find this useful, I might post a series.

**1. Hongdae/Sangsu/Hapjeong area is top-tier for Ramen and Tonkatsu.**  
Honestly, the density of high-quality Ramen and Tonkatsu places in this area is higher than anywhere else in Korea. There are tons of shops here, and the quality is genuinely excellent. If you’re into Japanese-style food, you should definitely give this area a shot.

**2. Consider visiting Suncheon, Gyeongju, or Gangneung.**  
These are my personal favorites and are very popular domestic travel spots for Koreans too. If you have time in your schedule, all of these are accessible via KTX (high-speed train).

* **Suncheon:** Famous for Kkomak (cockles) and the Suncheon Bay National Garden is beautiful. It’s located in the Jeolla province, which is known for having the best and most generous portions of food in Korea. If you like food, you'll love it here. I recommend visiting during the Garden Expo season, which usually runs from April to October.
* **Gyeongju:** A classic, but highly recommended. The royal tombs you see just walking down the street feel surreal and beautiful. It’s a city packed with cultural heritage from 1,000 years ago. It’s also the traditional ""school field trip"" destination for almost every Korean student.
* **Gangneung:** The East Coast scenery is amazing. It’s famous for Sundubu (soft tofu) and coffee. If you’ve never had Sundubu, imagine a super soft, silky version of tofu. Gangneung is also packed with great cafes, so it’s perfect if you’re a coffee lover.

**3. There are SO many festivals and events.**  
I feel like there’s always some cultural event happening here.  
From daily indie band gigs in Hongdae to major rock festivals like the Incheon Pentaport Rock Festival, Busan International Rock Festival, DMZ Peace Train, and Asian Pop Festival. We also have the Busan and Jeonju International Film Festivals.  
Even local festivals are fun. Recently, the ""Gimcheon Gimbap Festival"" went viral. (Fun fact: It was held there because the abbreviation for the famous chain Gimbap Cheonguk sounds like Gimcheon). Visiting these kinds of local events is a cool experience.

**4. Seasonal Seafood: Gizzard Shad (Aug-Sept) and Giant Yellowtail/Oysters (Nov-Jan).**  
Koreans love eating seasonal seafood.

* **Aug-Sept:** Gizzard Shad (Jeoneo). It’s a small fish. There’s an old saying that ""the smell of grilling Jeoneo brings a runaway daughter-in-law back home""—the taste is that rich and savory.
* **Nov-Jan:** Giant Yellowtail (Daebangeo) and Oysters.
   * **Giant Yellowtail:** It’s extremely fatty and delicious. The ""Giant"" version is much more famous and prized than regular yellowtail.
   * **Oysters:** Seafood isn't too expensive here, and oysters specifically are very cheap, so you can eat a lot for a low price. **However, be careful with raw oysters.** Many Koreans let their guard down and get Norovirus. Also, raw oysters sold in supermarkets are often meant for cooking, not eating raw. If you eat them raw, do it at your own risk (be prepared to potentially get sick the next day). I recommend trying Oyster Bossam, steamed oysters, or grilled oysters instead.

Yes, she died in my apartment.

Yes, I was by her side as her heart turned cold.

But God, no - I didn’t kill her.

It *may* look like we were alone, like no one broke in, but it’s a cruel trick. My fingerprints *may* be the only ones that were found on her body, but they didn’t need to lift a single finger to bleed her out.

So, I implore you - same as I’ve implored countless cops and detectives- don’t write me off because it’s easy. Don’t send me upriver for the rest of my life because it’s convenient. 

Read what I have to say. Then, consider the blood.

Because the truth is in the blood.

Both mine *and* hers.

\- - - - - 

*That night, I heard her knocking at seven on the dot…*

I sit down the silverware I’d been unpacking, wipe a thick film of sweat from my forehead with the collar of my already drenched T-shirt, and walk to answer it. I must have been wearing my surprise like a pair of oversized novelty glasses, because the first thing out of her lips when she sees me is: 

*“You forgot about movie night, didn’t you?”*

I consider fibbing, but think better of it.

*“Sure did.”* 

Bowing as if in the presence of royalty, I hold the door open for her, gesturing inside my war zone of an apartment. A wolfish smirk creeps across her lips. She walks in, gives me a good-natured pat on the head, and tosses a family-sized bag of white cheddar popcorn onto my black leather sofa. A waft of perfume-soaked air whispers to me as she passes by; it smells of citrus and sea spray.

*“You’re a fortunate man, Mateo.”*

I nod. As the door’s deadbolt clicks into the lock, I find myself disagreeing with her. I've never felt like I've had much luck at all. I keep the sentiment internal.

She smells too nice to argue.

As we have sex, the wrathful Florida sun mercifully sets under the horizon, though that did little to cool us and the apartment, even after we were done.

Earlier that week, I’d begun moving into the townhome’s lower level, and - just my luck - the unit’s air conditioning wouldn’t turn on. I wasn’t entirely shocked. The row of newly constructed houses on the isolated strip of land looked like a rush job. Some were still only half-built, for God’s sake.

Far as I could tell, I was the only person living there, too.

There wasn’t a great alternative for cooling the apartment. Mitigating the boiling summer heat with dollar store plug-in fans, as the landlord had so graciously suggested before hanging up on me, was a *very* funny joke. 

Wasn’t keen on keeping the windows open either. 

Behind the house, a two-minute walk down a steep, overgrown hill, sequestered behind a rusty fence, there’s an abandoned reservoir. It’s the literal definition of a cesspool. A tub the size of a battleship filled to the brim with stagnant water, which of course meant it was a breeding ground for insects. The one time I cracked a window, a downright biblical swarm laid siege to my apartment within the hour. 

To keep out pests, I learned I had to maintain a tight perimeter.

I pull some fresh clothes from an open box in my bedroom. When I return, I apologize profusely for the stuffiness. Elise smiles. Dimples crest up her cheek like a stone skipping across the surface of a lake. She dismisses the apology with a wave of the hand, never one to pollute a quiet moment by dwelling on the unchangeable.

I loved that about her.

A few minutes later, we finally settle onto the couch. She opens the bag of popcorn. I pop on a movie. 

Whether out of grief, or longing, or some misplaced sense of responsibility for what happened, I replay the events of that night in my head every day, on an endless loop, over and over again until I start to feel physically sick. 

Every window was shut. The door was locked. I’m sure of it.

I have to be sure of it.

\- - - - - 

We’re reclining next to each other on the couch. It’s too hot to cuddle, but we’re still holding hands. Our feet are propped up on the coffee table.

It’s not perfect, but it’s damn close.

Exhaustion sets in. The move has been tiring. I’m fading in and out of sleep. The pearly light of the TV glitters against my tired eyes. All of a sudden, my body feels simultaneously hot and icy; a halfway point between being feverish and being drunk. 

I don’t mind the feeling. It’s not unpleasant; it’s just strange.

There’s this *whooshing* sound. It’s right next to my ear, but I can’t place what’s making it. The sound reminds of my baby sister using her asthma inhaler - sharp, breathy gulps - but it’s much, much quieter, barely audible.

My head leans back. We haven’t touched the remote for hours, so the TV clicks itself off.

I drift through a long, dreamless sleep. A cozy sort of paralysis.

Slivers of golden light needle my closed eyelids.

It’s morning. I start to stir.

I feel her hand before I see her. Woozy, vision focusing, I sort of think I’m feeling the couch: a palmful of cold, stiff leather.

But there are fingernails.

I turn to look at Elise.

Inches away, a pair of soulless, moon-tinted eyes stare back at me. Wilted skin wraps tightly around her skull. Makes the angles of her cheekbones look like two trapped elbows desperately trying to break free. Her craggy, shriveled lips are slightly pursed. There’s a slit across the side of her neck. Its pale edges are serrated and dainty: death-colored petals of a carnation blooming along the bank of the River Styx.

I stare back at her and wait patiently for this macabre dream to end.

My body is in the moment, reactive: heart galloping, breathing shallow, sweat torrential. My mind is anywhere *but* the moment: numb, emotionless, and nearly blank, save for one question:

*Where did all her blood go?*

It’s clearly not in her. It’s not on her, not even around the slit in her neck. I scan my apartment - the couch, the floor, the walls - it's all spotless. So, where the hell else could it be?

I review that damning peculiarity until, finally, my mind catches up.

This is no dream.

Then, the brain-splitting panic sets in.

I don’t have dreamless nights anymore. 

Now, every night, I dream of a ghost-white, bloodless Elise, lips pursed, perpetually about to speak.

But I always wake up before I hear what she wants to say.

\- - - - - 

My mind catalogued the day that followed into short, fragmented memories. A stack of blurry polaroids shuffled out of chronological order, but the story they tell always ends at the police station.

I’m sitting at a wobbly steel table across from Detective Frank. He’s quickly proven himself to be a real bastard, so when he demands that I address him by his last name, I make sure to call him Frank.

He has a small head on a narrow neck leading down to a monstrous, pulpy gut. His body is shaped like a tube sock stuffed with ground beef being held in the air, fabric sagging into a mushy ball as gravity fights to claim the meat. Either Frank or the interrogation room stinks of piss. No reason it couldn’t be both, I think.

He insists on asking me the same three questions:

*“Why’d ya kill her?”*

*“Where’d ya hide the knife?”*

and

*“Do you really see y’self gettin’ away with this?”*

By the time I’m being berated by Frank, I’m done earnestly pleading my innocence. Initially, I’d been appealing my case, saying things to dead-eyed police officers like: 

*“Why would I call it in if I was the one who hurt her?”*

or

*“I loved Elise.”*

or even

*“There should have been so much blood - where was all her blood?”*

No one believes me, though. No one has even *pretended* to believe me to save face. In a bitter, painful way, I’m not entirely surprised: a white girl was found dead in my apartment. Even if the mechanics of her death beggar belief, it doesn’t matter - I’ve been convicted by circumstance. Might as well have put a shotgun to her head in the middle of Times Square and pulled the trigger.

Eventually, Frank gets bored and starts to play dirty.

*“Would you say you have a history of violent behavior, Mateo?”* He doesn’t smile, but there’s an impish lilt in his voice. Frank is pleased because he knows it’s a trick question.

*“I didn’t hurt Elise.”* I mutter, bleary eyes fixed on a small crack in the table.

There’s a pause. My heart thumps indecipherable code against the back of my throat. All of a sudden, he shoots up from his chair like a puppet sprung from a jack-in-the-box and repeats the question with righteous zeal.

*“Would you say you have a history of violent behavior -* ***yes*** *or* ***no****?”*

Still, I don’t respond. I have no winning answer.

*“If you asked me…”* he starts, now smiling, *“…I’d say yes. Nearly blindin’ a poor young man with a broken beer bottle sounds pretty violent.”*

He wants me to bite, but I stay silent, gaze fixed on the crack in the table, dread bloating in my gut as I imagine all the ways it could have gotten there.

There’s a knock. 

I look up long enough to catch Frank’s dismay. His jaw is clenched tight enough to chip a tooth. He’s staring daggers at the steel door, but the person on the other side doesn’t wait for him to become civil; she enters.

Surprisingly, I recognize her. I’ve seen her interviewed on the news plenty, usually on the steps of the courthouse.

The woman is tall and slender. She has brittle, ancient-looking gray hair, but her porcelain skin is smooth, youthful, and confusingly wrinkleless. Her brown eyes are hard as stone. Her expression betrays confidence. The clunky, navy-colored vest strapped over her well-pressed Italian suit is the only piece of her that lacks poise, but the item is clearly one of necessity, not of choice. It’s gently vibrating against her chest. Plastic tubing connects the vest to a lunchbox-shaped machine resting atop a rolling metal cart behind her. A young man with tense, overly-slicked hair is standing beside the cart. I assume correctly that he’s an underling who’s been assigned the inglorious task of driving it. 

Her name is Danica. She’s a hotshot lawyer with an undisclosed lung disease - hence the vest. It vibrates to break up mucus or something. I have no idea what she’s doing in my interrogation room.

I didn’t call her, and whatever she costs, I certainly couldn’t afford her.

*“Same shit, different day - isn't that right, Frank?”* she booms.

He straightens his spine and sputters a few embarrassing half-words, none of which are worth mentioning.

*“Has this man even been to the hospital yet, Frank? I mean, for the love of God, he’s clearly injured.”*

She points a long, unpolished finger at my neck. I tilt my chin down to look to where she’s gesturing. To my profound bewilderment, she’s right: if I really crane my eyes, I can see the jagged corner of a cut peeking out from under my shirt collar. There’s a splotch of dried blood the size of a quarter next to the lip of it. I lift my hand and run a fingertip over the edges, feeling the laceration snake over my shoulder.

The area around the cut is swollen - absolutely ripe with trapped fluid - but it doesn’t hurt. Even when I press a trembling fingertip into the slit, feeling it plunge beneath my skin, so deep that I can appreciate the hot, spongy muscle lying at the bottom, all I sense is a dull pressure. Despite being open, the wound is dry. The sticky moisture of blood is completely absent. It's like the entire thing has been both anesthetized and clotted over.

How is *any* of that possible?

Before I can get too wrapped up in the question, Danica motions for me to follow her. I do as I’m instructed. I can feel Frank’s eyes crawling over my body as the door slams shut.

The hallway is buzzing with activity. My eyes squint against the phosphorescent bulbs overhead, which are blinding compared to the dim light of the interrogation room. The lawyer looms motionless in front of me, statuesque, her mechanical vest quietly pulsing.

*“I’ll be taking your case pro bono - do you understand what that means?”*

I nod slowly, though I’m not confused by the legalese; I’m confused why she’s representing me free of charge in the first place.

*“Great.”* She snaps her fingers. Her intern - an overeager twenty-something I’d later find out is named Tim - hands me her card.

*“First and foremost, get that cut checked out at the ER. Tim will call you tomorrow to set up a meeting. Do you have anywhere else to stay other than your apartment?”*

I do, but I lie.

*“No.”*

Her gaze narrows. She looks disappointed. Without another word, Danica turns and walks away.

I watch as she strides down the corridor, weaving herself through the crowd, nimble and elegant, never losing her pace.

All the while, Tim and her artificial tail struggle to keep up.

\- - - - - 

I sleep through most of the wait at the emergency room. 

I’m nudged awake by a nurse with a kind voice. I sit up straight, grimacing as I stretch. My neck is stiff. It aches from the awkward rest, body curled into a chair, head draped over its cushioned handle. In comparison, the deep, muscle-exposing gash in my shoulder still feels fine. No pain at all, and it’s barely bleeding. A few drops here and there. Nothing more.

I’m led by the nurse into an exam room that smells of days-old coffee and fresh bile. As I lower myself onto a hospital bed, a gruff physician with meteor-sized bags under his eyes stomps in after her. He inspects the wound with the tenderness of an MMA fighter, yanking and pulling the edges, out then in, lips open then closed, like he’s pretending to make it speak. I’m glad I can hardly feel it.

*“How the hell did you get cut like this?”* he barks into my ear.

I fabricate a story. Something about a construction accident. He grunts.

He draws a few blood tests to confirm I’m not in need of blood from the injury, which feels ass-backwards, taking blood to decide if I need *more* blood, but I don’t complain. Then, he sews the wound shut, and stomps off to see some other patients while the labs are cooking. I lay back on the hospital bed and try to relax.

While he’s gone, I think about the cut. 

Elise had an identically shaped cut across her neck. I figure it can’t be a coincidence, but that begs the question - why am I still alive? Why wasn’t I drained like she was?

As I consider the possible answers, misery digs its roots in deep. The chaos of being implicated in her murder led me to barricade my emotions in an act of self-preservation. Now, with the threat somewhat managed, that barricade was melting down.

Tears well. My chest feels tight. I’m scared, and I’m angry, and, God, I just don’t understand.

As if to comfort me, Elise materializes in my mind. Her bouncy, cocoa-colored curls. Her glacier-blue eyes. Her world-soothing smile.

The image flickers. Fades.

Then, all I can picture is her waxy, soot-tinted face and her soulless eyes; a pair of white grapes wilted to the size of raisins.

Dead Elise won’t leave, and I can’t get her to go.

Panic drips down my spine.

I leap up from the hospital bed and throw the sliding doors open. I hear the physician behind me. He’s attempting to flag me down. Something about my blood is off, he says. More tests are pending.

I’m not listening, and I don’t slow down.

Before long, I’m in an Uber, head leaning against the warm glass of the passenger side window, watching Miami dissolve on the horizon. When I step out of the car, the wrathful Florida sun is starting to set once again.

And there’s a humming in the air.

\- - - - - 

The evening devolves into an alcohol-fueled daze. 

I’m in my bedroom, slumped over my desk, head down. I lift the bottle from the floor and take a lazy sip. Whiskey burns a numb pleasure in the pit of my stomach.

I’m listlessly staring out the window that faces the hill behind my house. I can’t see the reservoir through the blackness, but I know it’s there. My neck feels tight and frozen, like someone is tenderly strangling me with an icepack, but my torso feels warm and full. There’s a gentle *whooshing* right next to my ear. None of this bothers me in the moment, not even when a human-shaped silhouette drifts into view outside the window, wearing the night like a shroud.

I squint, but I can’t make out their features. It’s just a blurry head with broad shoulders atop an unnaturally slender torso. The figure drifts closer. A rapid thrumming overwrites the *whooshing*. It sounds like the beating of helicopter blades.

Because of the sharp decline, it’s a fifteen-foot drop from that window to the ground.

How could anyone be standing there, and, more importantly,

where did Elise’s blood go?

\- - - - - 

I wake up gasping and terrified. 

I fall off the chair. My ass hits the floor with a painful *thump.* The half-empty whiskey bottle tips over in the commotion, clattering against the hardwood, spilling its copper contents into a small, sticky puddle.

It’s morning. No specter of death hovering outside my window - just harsh sunlight.

A groan mixed with a sigh billows from my lips. I’m about to get myself upright when I notice something odd. 

There’s a slight wetness beneath my shirt, but it’s not on the correct side. My healing cut is on the right shoulder, not the left, and it’s bandaged - it shouldn’t be leaking *anything*. 

I rip off the shirt, jump upright, and sprint to the bathroom.

When I flick on the light, there it is: 

another identical cut. 

A mirror image of the older one hidden under the white bandage.

It doesn’t hurt.

It’s barely bleeding.

And for some inexplicable reason, unlike Elise,

I remain unfortunately alive. 

\- - - - - 

Honestly, I expected Danica’s office to match her character. Lavish. Larger than life. A corner office at the apex of some monolithic skyscraper. In reality, the space is little more than a broom closet with a filing cabinet in the courthouse's basement. Tim has to wait in the hall to make room for me.

Her desk is cluttered with used coffee cups and haphazard stacks of jaundiced legal paper. She leans forward and asks me to recount the events of that night. Her gaze is intense. Minutes turn to hours, and she never seems to blink.

At first, I’m reluctant. I know the story sounds unhinged; I can hardly believe it myself. Danica was different, though. She didn’t sneer. She didn’t roll her eyes. Even when I show her the second cut, she remains neutrally attentive. It’s an incredible breath of fresh air.

*“Do you believe me?”* I ask.

*“That’s not really the point,”* she quips. There’s a pause. The soft buzzing of her vest fills the silence. After what felt like days of unbroken eye contact, her gaze floats away from me.

*“But I do, yes.”*

I watch the words stumble over her tongue; each syllable is slow and drawn out. Bathed in the piercing glow of the ceiling bulbs, her porcelain skin almost appears to gleam. It’s not as perfectly smooth as I first thought, though. Close up, I detect a few subtle creases both above and below her lips, crisp and thin like tally marks.

*“So, what’s next?”*

*“Well, the police will get a warrant to search your house. Presumably, they won’t find the murder weapon, but I don’t think that’ll steer them away from indictment, and they might elect to arrest you, regardless of what they discover. Do you have money to pay bail if they do?”*

I shake my head *no.*

*“Don’t worry. Just call me. I’ll see what I can do.”*

Danica is undeniably the single beacon shining in the depths of a very black night, but I don’t understand *why*, and the amount of things I just plain don’t understand are starting to weigh heavy on my chest like a load of bricks, making each breath shallow and agonizing.

*“What’s your angle?”*

She cocks her head.

*“I mean, why are you doing all this? What do you get out of helping me?”*

*“Do I need a reason to want to help someone? Someone who’s inches away from becoming just another martyr to a very old, very broken system?”*

I hesitate, but an answer eventually slips out.

*“Yes. I think so.”*

Tim knocks on the door and then swings it open.

*“Your two’o’clock is here, ma’am.”*

Danica forces a weak smile.

*“We’ll discuss this another time, Mateo. In the meantime, you need to be safe. If I were you, I wouldn’t go home. Call in a favor. Crash on someone’s couch. Just don’t skip town.”*

As I step out, she volunteers one more piece of unsolicited advice.

*“Might want to get that second cut looked at, too.”*

\- - - - - 

I make a stop on my way home, but it’s not back to the emergency room; it’s to the hardware store. The pair of wireless video cameras I can afford aren’t top of the line, but they’ll make do.

Just as the sun begins to set, I’ve finished installing them: one in my living room, one in my bedroom. I hop in my car, flip my laptop open in my lap, and drive until the feed starts to get hazy, which ends up being about halfway down the block.

Night falls.

The bitter sting of an energy drink trickles down my throat. I crush the can and lob it into the back seat. I have five more where that came from if need be.

I’m not sure what I think I’m going to catch, but my eyes remain glued to the screen in anticipation.

Hours pass. 

I chug another caffeine spritzer and wring my shoulders out. I wonder if paranoia is a known symptom of grief. I’m about to call off the amateur stakeout when I spot movement.

My jaw drops. I rub my finger so vigorously against the screen that it squeaks, but it’s no smudge, and it keeps moving, slithering through my house, searching for something.

Searching for *me*.

It came from under the door; pinched itself through the tiny space between the door and its frame.

A tube.

The front of it glides like an elephant trunk, fanning side to side, edges wrinkling like it’s sniffing the air, but it’s much, much longer. Five feet, ten feet, fifteen feet - the silent worm continues to elongate.

I can see it on the bedroom feed now.

My phone vibrates in my pocket. My entire body spasms. I yelp.

Clumsily, I retrieve it.

The name of the emergency room flashes across the screen. I silence the call and toss my phone into the cupholder.

I bring my eyes back to the feed. It’s rooting through a box of my clothes now. When it finds nothing, the head reappears, spinning in small, dizzy circles. Eventually, it springs forward and plunges into my laundry hamper, passing right by the camera lens as it does.

Paper-thin teeth line the rim. They’re shaped like candy corn. The tube itself is translucent. I can see the rest of my room through its diameter, though it’s blurry and distorted, as if you were to use an unwashed glass as a telescope.

All of sudden, I have an epiphany.

If it came from under the door, there should be *some* part of it lingering on my stoop, right? 

I try to look, but I can’t see my stoop from my position: there’s a mass of shrubs in the way. Setting my laptop on the dashboard above the steering wheel, I roll down the window, and shove my head out of the car.

With enough elevation, I see something. 

There’s someone standing at my door, facing away from me. 

They’re tall, and they’re naked. Their hair is long and uncut. Thin black strands dangle against the small of their back. 

My heart flutters wildly against my rib cage.

Movement on the video feed catches my attention. I throw myself back in the car and grab my laptop from the dashboard.

The snout of the tube is pointing straight up. The edges appear agitated, or excited; they’re expanding and contracting feverishly. From the size of a soup can to the size of a manhole cover and then back again, over, and over, and over.

Then, at a seemingly impossible speed, the tube retracts. 

It retreats from my bedroom to my living room to explode out from under the door like a bolt of lightning. 

I look up from the screen. 

My eyes bulge from their sockets. 

I launch myself back out the window.

There’s no one on my stoop anymore. 

A distant thrumming slinks into my ear. 

The sound is directly overhead. It’s eerily familiar, and it’s getting louder.

It’s getting louder, because *they’re* getting closer. 

A wave of panic surges through my skull. I ram the key into the ignition. My foot crashes onto the pedal. The acrid odor of burning rubber fills the air as I peel out, and I hope that masks my scent.

Because I think that’s how they found me in the first place.

\- - - - -  

I’m driving down the highway towards Miami. My body is depleted, but I don’t expect my mind will be ready to sleep for another few decades. I rack my brain, trying to place where I’ve heard that *thrumming* sound before.

Suddenly, a nagging question pops into my head.

How Danica know about the cut before I did?

I make a wild U-turn, nearly clipping a city bus as my car skids. 

The courthouse is in the other direction. 

\- - - - - 

*“Why did you kill Elise?”* I demand. 

Her overstuffed office feels like an oven in the early morning. Viscous globules of sweat pour from every inch of my body. My grip on the pocket knife becomes tenuous. I can feel the plastic handle sliding in my palm. Still, I point the blade at her like I plan on using it.

Danica doesn’t look frightened. She doesn’t look fazed at all, really.

She just sits at her desk, staring at me.

I decide to show her what I know.

I stomp around the side of her desk and begin ripping the tubes from her vest. I even slam my fist into the connected machine’s conveniently labeled *“OFF”* button for good measure. 

The vest stills. The machine powers down.

And yet, the *thrumming* continues, emanating from her chest, buzzing like the wings of some elephantine mosquito.

It was all just camouflage.

Guess she can’t control the noise. 

*“Why did you kill - “*

*“Not me,”* she mutters.

*“What…?”* I ask, not convinced that I heard her correctly.

She leans back in her chair and sighs. I shake the knife closer to her. It wobbles in my grasp.

*“You wouldn’t happen to know what was there before they built your housing complex, do you?”* She looks up and meets my gaze. Her sharp, bark-colored eyes bore vicious holes into me.

*“Of course you don’t,”* she continues. *“Well, it was an old slaughterhouse. A big one, too. A giant slaughterhouse perched above a massive reservoir. A strange pairing, but it worked just fine. Better than fine, actually. Plenty of blood dripping down that hill, and it all disappeared into the water.”*

The thrumming in her chest intensifies, becoming shrill, almost melodic.

*“It was a good system, Mateo. That arrangement held things in balance for nearly a century,”* she scowls, gathering the tubes and reinserting them into her vest with a glint of annoyance in her features.

*“But now, things are different: my nieces…my nieces are going hungry.”*

I step back, stumbling over loose papers on the floor. The corners of Danica’s mouth ripple. They extend a few centimeters from her face, and then quickly retract. Her teeth seem to swirl around her gums like shards of glass in a washing machine.

*“My one niece - Rossa - she’s a nasty, voracious little thing. I’ve seen her proboscis grow miles long, and boy, has she developed a taste for you.”*

I still have the knife pointed at her, and yet, she feels safe enough to turn away. She flicks the her fake appliance back on and begins tinkering with settings.

*“Your blood is different, she claims.”* Danica snaps her fingers. She’s trying to recall the word Rossa used.

*“Ah!”* she gasps, pivoting back to face me.

Leaning forward, she whispers: *“Sour. That’s what she said - ‘exhilaratingly sour’. Unfortunately, she can’t have very much at one time. Hurts her stomach. Still, she loves it. Unlike your partner, who was evidently quite bland in comparison, and not very filling…”*

My fear curdles into a seething rage. I squeeze the handle of the knife so hard that the bones in my fingers ache. I shoot towards her and place the edge to her throat. I expect her to recoil, but she tilts into my advance. The blade rests tightly on her skin.

*“Listen, Mateo - to answer your question from yesterday: yes, my desire to help you wasn’t purely altruistic. I suppose I feel partially responsible for your…situation. They are my kin, after all, and they haven’t developed self-control, or a place in your society, like I have…”*

She twists her neck. The knife draws blood. Delicate crimson dewdrops fall, sizzling as they contact the metal.

*“But don’t fool yourself. Killing me here changes nothing. In fact, I’d argue it would make your predicament substantially worse, because, at the end of the day, who will believe you? They didn’t believe you when you said you didn’t kill Elise. They didn’t believe you when you said you hit that boy with a beer bottle in self-defense.”*

She winks, then continues to whet the blade against her porcelain skin. More boiling blood sprays against the knife.

*“That ‘boy’ has been charged with multiple counts of assault since your encounter, by the way. I checked. A real bellicose individual, it seems.”*

Danica’s mouth narrows to the diameter of a straw. Like a tornado hovering over the earth, it skirts across the knife, suctioning the blood back into her gullet. I hear her shifting teeth clinking against the metal. It sounds like hail. 

Hot nausea licks at my tonsils. My entire body is becoming numb and heavy.

Once the knife practically sparkling, her mouth snaps back into its normal shape.

*“My question to you is this: why now? When you’re caught standing over my corpse, cradling a blood-drenched knife like it’s the only thing you have left in this world, why do you expect they’ll believe you* ***now****?”*

My grip on the blade loosens. Every painful emotion - all the terror, all the anger, all the hurt - seems to evaporate in my veins. They leak like steam into the stale air of her claustrophobic office.

Because she’s right.

I fold my knife inward, shove it in my pocket, and sprint from Danica’s office.

*“Only come back if you’re willing to cooperate,”* she shouts after me.

*“And if you see Rossa before I do, well, tell her I say hello.”*

\- - - - - 

And that brings me up to this evening.

I’ve thought long and hard about what Danica told me. Don’t know if her intention was truly one of guidance, but I’m thankful nonetheless. 

Like I mentioned, she’s absolutely right. As it stands, there’s no reason for anyone to believe what I have to say. It’s an outlandish story, and a pisspour alibi. The scales of logic and objectivity are weighted against me.

But that makes the solution simple. All I need to do is put my finger on the scales. Tip things back in my direction.

So that’s what I plan on doing. 

Right now, I’m sitting in my car with the windows rolled up tight, down the street from my house.

I just got off the phone with Detective Frank.

Told the poor bastard that I have *so much* to show him regarding Elise's murder. He can bring as many friends as he wants, too; he just needs to meet me here *now*.

If Rossa is truly as voracious as Danica claims, I figure she’ll make an appearance, flying up from the reservoir to get a taste of all this nice new blood. Either Frank will survive with the image of that human mosquito burned into the back of his eyeballs, or he won’t survive at all.

Seems like a win-win to me.

While I wait, I plan on listening to the message the emergency room left on my voicemail when they called last night.

The wrathful sun is beginning to set once again. 

Danica, if you somehow find this, I want to thank you for the wisdom.

I’m about to render that very same wisdom to sweet old Frank:

Seeing

It’s usually the kind of table you’d expect in a living room, but the design actually works really well in a bedroom setting. What makes it fit is the rounded, cloud-like shape and the glossy white finish.   
  
It doesn’t feel bulky, and it sits low enough to work beside a chair or near the edge of the bed without getting in the way. The surface is just enough for a candle, a plant, a small book stack, or whatever you normally keep within reach. It adds a clean, modern touch without overpowering the rest of the room. I also noticed it reflects warm lighting nicely at night, which gives the room a softer feel.   
  
It’s one of those pieces that adds personality with very little effort. I’m still trying different setups and will probably share more pieces later, but I wanted to start with this one.

1p2vltx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p2vltx,Eleven- how the confines of Romance shaped her.,"(EDIT : Guys, I had made this post in the main sub a few days ago but it got reported and deleted duh. It's very Mileven coded. Don't come for me (TT) But it's my dissection of her character. And I will only accept this kind of Mileven ending even though I am raging byler shipper lol. I am posting it here because I don't think this deserves to go to complete waste)

Original post:

 I love El way too much that I had to sit down and write this. Eleven/Jane Hopper still confines all of what she does with Mike and being his girlfriend. 

You don't have to agree with my thoughts and that's cool. I just hope we all can have respectful discussion. If you think Mike and El are the best romance in the show, you are welcomed here. If you don't think Mike and El are the best romance, you are still welcomed here. Now, moving onto the real discussion.

It was the night of November 6th 1983 when everything changed for El. She ran and ran. Finally breathing in the fresh scent of freedom. We, as the viewers, don't know much about El up until now other than the fact that she was a lab experiment all her life, produced and raised to be treated like a powerful weapon. We could see that she was a completely disoriented kid and lacked  communication abilities. She didn't understand what Friendship, privacy, societal norm or romantic love were. She was basically a toddler in the body of a 12 year old. Not emotionally mature enough for her age. Distinctly different from other kids. And then she was rescued by a group of boys who were looking for their lost friend. It was a ray of hope in the pits of darkness she grew up in. The boys showed her kindness and helped her. One of them sheltered her in his basement. He was her mentor, a guide into the real world. He taught her normalcy and how to behave and act. And then that boy kissed her after a few days of knowing her. He had a crush on her. But she did not know what a crush was. They were in a romantic relationship within 6-7 days of her escape. She sacrificed herself to save all of them but she came out safe.

Now fast forward to season 2, she misses Mike, her friend and lover. She is now learning all about romance from soap operas, a very dysfunctional way of discovering romance for such a traumatised kid like her. She needs good examples of romantic relationships in her life from elders and then discover romance herself but that is not what happens. Instead, she learns to love the way of the operas. She finally gets reunited with Mike, the love of her life at the age of 13.

Then season 3 rolls around, El and Mike spend the whole summer making out. Their relationship is in the honeymoon phase. Her room is filled with Mike, his name, his pictures, his drawings and a lot more. We see Mike's room but it doesn't really have anything that reminds him of El in his room or basement. She is shown as being obsessed with Mike, which is not really a bad thing if done in moderation and for a brief period of time. Then we learn that she has become friends with Max. And we come to see that she has the most character growth in season 3 when Max comes into her life and she is not Mike's girlfriend anymore. Then they fight the flesh monster. Mike is worried about her pushing herself too much. She loses her powers. And then learns about Hopper's death. She is heartbroken to lose her father. And she finally gets back with Mike right before moving to California, with him being the only emotionally reliable figure in her life now. 

In season 4, we can see that she has made her entire identity about Mike. No one can blame her. She is trying her best to be accepted and feel loved. But something feels off. The way her smile drops and she plants a new one. But in all of this mess, from the time she escaped that lab, did we ever sit back, think and question on why we don't really know much about her? Did we ever notice that we know almost nothing about HER? 

Did we ever see her just yk being herself and not Mike's thoughts interjecting into it or her thoughts circling back to Mike in some way? We can compare Max with her to analyse. We know so much about Max. From her song choices, to her dressing sense to her love for stake boarding to her way of Halloween and so much more.

In the 7 months of living in California, did we ever see any quirks that she has learnt or picked up in this new town or how she interacted with her family or just her life as a little girl? What did she do in the free time in her bedroom or just literally anything except her school project which again was there to depict the grief of losing her father figure. Do we know anything? Her excessive dependency issue was blatantly visible in her letters, her room, her shrine box for Mike & her dressing sense. Heck, it was even visible in her talk, lies and smiles. Her mind was completely consumed by Mike and how she needed to prove to him that she was happy and perfect so Mike wouldn't reject her or lose interest in her because she was scared of losing the only other stable figure in her life. Which is fair. But all of this is quite an unhealthy practice for a traumatised kid like her. (Again this was all her thoughts, not Mike's so I am not bringing him down. He was also trying his best.)

And after practically begging for Mike's verbal affection, she did not get any. Then she was taken away from Mike. And we can see she had the most growth in her character arc only after that. From standing up against Papa to facing her darkest memories to realising her true potential to exploring her own feelings. 

I would like to point out...I mean what do you truly know about her, about her hobbies, her interests, what she likes to do in her free time, how she interacts with her found family, what is her favorite subject, what is her least favourite thing in the entire world? What does she like to eat and what does she dislike? We know nothing about her except her fascination with Eggos which she had picked a liking for when she was 12. What else?

The same cannot be said about the other kids. We know a lot of things about the other kids who had a more peaceful ""normal"" life. So why do you think we know nothing about her? It's because she herself hasn't discovered anything about her life due to her traumatic past and escape through Mike.....she is unable to heal herself because she is too focused on appearing perfect in front of Mike and confining her entire self to romance. This is because he is her only escape from the grief of Hopper's death and her way of stepping into normality. Again, the only time she had discovered a bit of herself was with Max. She loves Max and cares about her deeply. Max was the first person to show kindness to her without any expectations of being a girlfriend or a daughter. Just a friend who understands. Her being just El was enough for Max. And that was the real reason she was able to fight Vecna in the finale of season 4. It was due to her love for Max that motivated and pushed her, not Mike's speech. I will never diminish her love for Max by prioritising Mike's speech. Ofcourse Mike's speech definitely helped in boosting her confidence but the major reason she was able to overcome Vecna's grasp was when she saw Max on the verge of death, suffering in agonising pain. I am a firm believer of the fact that it was Max and her suffering that pushed El, not Mike's confession speech. Her love for Max was already powerful enough. Though, Mike's speech definitely helped.

And now we know this is a girl who has gone through so much. She deserves a break from literally everything and just take a deep breath of fresh air and live freely. Her story, in my opinion is about her finally learning to be herself and learning to live for herself. Discover life without the confines of Romance or expectations. Find out if she likes coffee with cream or not, her favourite music band, her favourite food spot and her go-to-drink. There are so many things she has yet to do. Just so many things. And I just feel heartbroken that all her childhood she wasn't able to discover this part of herself. This is my love letter to El, Miss Jane Hopper, the girl whose monsters I wish I could paint over with life and hope and love. The girl who could live with her own quirks, the one who finally looked inside herself and saw a shining colourful mess waiting to blossom and thrive. 

And only after all of this should Mike should come into the picture. I love him and I know he loves her so much but she needs a break from everything for a moment and some time to look inside herself. Her dating Mike after she finally finds herself makes perfect sense in my head. Ofcourse Mike is going to wait for her so yes, she can get back with him at anytime she feels she ready. But they need to spend time again as just friends, atleast for a while, and learn to communicate, understand and be honest with each other without the sweet but cruel veil of romance engulfing everything. Their love is beyond friendship or romance. It's something precious and innocent that should be untainted by the tragidies of unfulfilled expectations. I don't want them to spoil their bond because of their ongoing immature romance. They need to grow into adults separately and then get back together. It would be straight outta romance book lol if it actually happens.

But I don't really see how them being together in this particular situation is going to benefit either of them in the long run. Even Mike needs some time separate from El to tackle his insecurities on his own without the constant reassurance of Will and grow as a man. Their souls are severely bruised from all the trauma and they both need each other without the neverending expectations being attached to it. Just pure company and support. Atleast for the time being. It's a bond that's worth investing time on.

So what do you all think? Was it Mike's love that pushed her or was it her love for Max? And are you satisfied with her current arc? Is it unecessesary or odd for her to live a little, apart from romance? Or is romance appropriately necessary for her self discovery arc? Will it be weird if she comes into her person without Mike completely occupying and shaping every part of herself?

Sorry for such a long rant but El is my favourite character and I feel strongly for her so I just wanted to share my thoughts. What do you all think? 

(Edit: What you all think as byler fans? I used to be a Mileven shipper so I have a soft spot for the ship and that's why I wrote this. Also because I love my baby El)

Started cutting up the material yesterday and that pool was very clean, well it looked clean when I left last night, arrived this morning pump not working and miss says pool looks dirty.

Took me a while to get going this morning like I suggested we stay a couple of nights  ( not moved in yet) since honey had today off/long weekend, well the big bash you know the monks the family and friends the party and the ritual to bless the new house etc not tilll next month, so says her favourite monk who is up country near mum, who she sent to ask for the date etc etc, Stevie wonders superstation is playing in my mind, it’s ok, no big deal if you have to wait 3 weeks, gives me a chance to get a few things done.

We’ll miss says if you want to stay over night we have to do a mini ceremony, ummm ok, then drags me to big c makes me spend 3000 on fruits etc just to give it all away to delivery people that rocked up today, and yes we had our mini ceremony pic included now she can sleep in peace tonight… 

Well she wanted a early start the brain was not engaged as there was no time for my heavy duty expresso this morning, turned the pump on to manual about 20 min later realize I arrived just after 7 am the auto kicks in at 7.30, haha well there you go, thought the builder got me a cheapo pump…

3rd attempt at a coffee was successful, first, milk was off, so when to big c and bought another bottle, 2cd attempt brain fog and now around 9 pm no caffeine in me and im just not working, forgot to put the filter on my aero press, now im rather pissed off and on withdrawal….miss says you can stay here on your own tonight if I don’t calm down.

Got a pool service guy to look after the pool since I know nothing about them, and he arrived not long after the caffeine does its trick, drops something in the pool says he’s back Monday, cut some more material today and there a lot of saw dust on the pool surface, guess I’m gonna drive him nuts untill I Finnish what I’m doing.

I should get a great nights sleep tonight we bought a king size bed, never known anybody to sleep like eagles wings spread like she and then it’s my fault I wake her up. She is always cold too, I did  suggest not sleeping with air con on, noooooooooooo, I have air con set at 26 in bedroom, she wants it cooler, we compromised as I prefer no air con all year round, just recently I dropped it too 21 for two nights when told her after the fact she goes ho that’s why I was cold!, as you have guessed women don’t ever know what they want…",3,1763722194.0,THAILANDliving,1,1.0,False

I have irregular cycles lasting anywhere from 18 to 31 days, so I can’t properly predict when my period will come, but I do know it’s almost always towards the beginning of the month. With that being said, I also don’t track ovulation.

I had unprotected sex twice just after my period ended. Then about a week later I started noticing cramping in my lower abdomen, more pronounced lower back pain, bloating, headaches, my breasts feel bruised, off-and-on nausea, lower abdominal cramps that felt like menstrual cramps but also somehow different that only lasted a couple of days? I also couldn’t stand the taste of coffee—and I love coffee, so this was very strange for me. The next day I felt a sharper, more pronounced cramp in my lower left abdomen that lasted only a few seconds. Fast forward a couple of days, and I’m still experiencing all of this, but now I’ve noticed increased urination (I’m peeing like once an hour minimum), some discharge when I wipe (pale yellow on the tissue with clear jelly-like mucus, which I have never noticed before), as well as little white “floaties” in my urine that I’ve never seen before. I’ve also been vegetarian for a bit now and I was craving meat (specifically biscuits and sausage gravy from this little chain in my town) that I went and got a double serving and devoured it. Plus I’ve had increased thirst and hunger today, like I’ve been starving all day. Now I’m literally sat here eating a banana with roasted red pepper hummus and lemon juice because it just sounded so good—and it’s pretty amazing. On top of that I’ve just been really tired and gassier than normal.

I would be more than happy to chalk this all up to PMS, but I never have PMS symptoms this far away from when I typically menstruate, so it’s really throwing me off. I normally don’t even cramp until the day of my period. If I’m to believe my period tracker app, I’m still about 10 days or so away from when I’m “supposed” to start my period. And my breasts are NEVER sore.

They had a very strict rule, that no one in high school was aloud to work there. They ended up making one exception to this rule last year. The hired a 16 year old girl who’s parents were friends with the owners, and she was homeschooled so her class schedule didn’t interfere with the hours.

When this girl started I couldn’t stand her and I wasn’t the only one, but since they saw me as the strongest employee I was scheduled to work with her most days. The more I got to talking with her the more I realized she wasn’t that bad, she just didn’t have the best work ethics. A lot of the stories she would tell me about her current life, were very similar to things I had gone through in my teen years. I started to see myself as an older sister and I think she felt the same way. She’s come in and see me on her days off just to keep me up to date with her life and her mom would even come in and tell me about how happy she was working with me.

I don’t think the manager and owner liked this girl and I getting along, and they started treating her like crap. They cut her hours  so she would only work once a week and when I asked the manager about it, I was told they were trying to get her to quit. I really didn’t see the point as she was only working with me and since we started getting along her productivity at work improved. When I heard that I started offering her one of my shifts a week so she could make some more money. She would also cover me if I needed to call out, which she had never done for anyone previously. 

A while later, there was an incident, and it escalated to the point that the owner threatened to fire me. That night, I called this girl, balling my eyes out, letting her know that I would be quitting the next day. She also started crying. I let her know that I wasn’t crying because I was sad about the job, I was just so upset and touched by her friendship. It felt so nice to have a friend I could talk to at work and share some of my wisdom with. Before I hung up I let her know that she should also quit before they start treating her worse and I’d be happy to give her a recommendation for a job when she found one. She needed up quitting a few weeks later and got a job doing what she loves.

I've been wearing my watch for 3 months now 24/7 (with small forced breaks for showers or some manual work).
I'm not new to the world of watches, I have a modest collection of 9 pieces, which I recently wrote a post about.
But some time ago I bought a Casio lineage LCW-M100TS watch, which has become not only my GADA watch, but also my always on wrist watch.
I understand that this case is not for everyone, but I hope I'm not the only one in the world.
The thing is that there is a real need for this, it's not just an experiment.
It's also especially important that this watch is currently the most comfortable of all that I've had, due to its lightness, materials and low profile.
We recently had a child and a lot in our lives now depends on timing.
So as it turned out, the most convenient way to answer the question ""what time is it?"" in the middle of the night It's looking at your watch on your wrist instead of looking for your phone on the nightstand and blinding yourself with the backlight.
By the way, about the backlight, the built-in diode is enough to banally illuminate your way in a dark room or bathroom, so as not to turn on the light and suddenly wake up the child.
We also like coffee (v60 clever dripper) which needs to be brewed according to the time and here the stopwatch turns out to be very convenient, much more convenient than the stopwatch in the phone, because you can go do other things and always control the time.

I don’t have an IBS diagnosis, no cramps, no pain, and I’m otherwise healthy. But every morning I get:
	•	1st poop: comes out fast/explosive but more formed (not fully solid)
	•	2nd poop: a few minutes later, softer/runny but still brown (not watery)
	•	Sometimes a 3rd: even looser
Then I’m fine for the rest of the day.

Some background:
	•	This started after I switched protein powders multiple times. One of them had acesulfame K and made me bloated.
	•	I’m now using an unflavored whey isolate (1 ingredient, no sweeteners) and it doesn’t bloat me, but I’m wondering if whey itself could be causing loose stools even if it’s lactose-free or low-lactose.
	•	I eat oatmeal every morning with chia and lactose-free milk. I’ve eaten this for over a year without problems.
	•	My stool is always brown and digested—just loose, not watery.
	•	I recently had some very large meals (huge brunches). Could overeating or gut irritation cause this for weeks?

I tried taking psyllium at night, and the first poop in the morning became a bit more formed, so that helped. But the second poop is still loose.

Can anyone explain what might be going on?

My oatmeal:
- 40g rolled oats
- splash of lactose-free milk
- 1 banana
- 1 tablespoon chia seeds
- 1 teaspoon cacao powder
- a bit of cinnamon
- a bit of instant coffee
- ~15 drops monk fruit sweetener

The thing is, only Devan's Plantation AAA dark roast and Tulum coffee that I had were actually likeable.

I would say Plantation AAA dark roast from Devan's is hard to fuck up - because I used to make great coffee with Agaro manual grinder too with it. 

Apart from that I haven't really enjoyed coffee despite trying pour over or espresso or aeropress in all the other coffees ground by C3S at various grind settings and water temperature and even using bottled mineral water.

Which leads me to ask the question - what am I doing wrong? 

Most of the times I have seen that if I grinder below 13 clicks I get a good flavor but above it I get weak woody flavours - heavily under extracted even if I steep for 4+ min in aeropress or use 95°C+ water

I'm really frustrated and doubting my taste buds tbh. 

I saw a short video of James Hoffman discussing importance of bad coffee from outlets and instant coffee etc. To basically reset your already heightened taste buds ""used to"" the best flavors and thus needing more highs otherwise feeling great coffee as just meh. So I tried a reset with instant coffee and there was surely an appreciation of brews I made after it but then again I felt like I was drinking sub par coffee. 

Anyone else feel like they're making meh coffee all the time?

I was a long-time Revolut user (I still am), and in Europe, I paid for almost everything with it just because of the **built-in analytics and budget tracking**. We even had a joint account with my girlfriend to keep track of our shared expenses.

**Everything was great until we moved to Asia and started to live a nomadic lifestyle.** There are still places in the world where **cash is still king** and you just can’t pay by card. We juggled with cash and card for some time, now it is QR payments, cash, and card (for bigger payments in trusted places). But, as you can imagine, *our spending tracking system went to hell* with this variety of payment methods.

I started to look for a solution, tested a bunch of expense tracking apps on the App Store, but the closest thing I could find to the features list we needed was TravelSpend. It probably works great if you are a tourist, but we needed **monthly-based tracking, not trip-based.**

The features list we needed:

* **Monthly budget target and spending stats in our home currency** (my income still in CZK)
* **Multi-currency support**: to pay in VND, THB or whatever and don’t convert in our heads or using the calculator app, but I still need to see both numbers (paid in and home currency)

1p2vcox,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1p2vcox/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1p2vb3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBrits/comments/1p2vb3o/britisheuropean_coffee_brand_with_a_car_mascot/,British/European coffee brand with a car mascot???,"A few years back, around about after the pandemic ended I started going to more cafes and restaurants with my family. And near those places there was this one small shop that sold a lot of deli products and other interesting food and drinks, and they had this small, generic looking coffee station. One day I went to get a hot chocolate since it was cold outside and I didn't like coffee, but I decided to do something different and get a mocha, and it ended up being the best mocha I'd ever had. Most times I'd had mochas it just tasted like regular coffee that I didn't really like with a tiny bit of sweetness, but this I genuinely really enjoyed. I ended up getting it a couple times after that before one time I accidentally clicked on a regular coffee instead of the mocha, and somehow it was just as good if not better. It wasn't bitter, it wasn't really sweet or too milky or bland or anything, and it was actually tasty, like I wanted to get more. To the point where I would get one every time I was in the area and would even go out of my way sometimes just to buy this coffee from some random ass machine.

The problem is, now the store is permanently closed, I tried to look up what coffee they used a while before that, but I couldn't find much and didn't bother looking any further since I didn't think they'd close any time soon. It was a generic looking machine kiosk thing, but it looked a little more nice/fancier than most machines, it had a bright teal/aquamarine and white colour scheme, and the main detail was they had a weird, 3D render of a van/car thing that looked like a shitty ripoff car from the movie cars with the same colour scheme as a mascot for some reason. 

Does anyone know what I'm talking about? I can't find it online absolutely anywhere, and I think it was a relatively small company, but I can't stress how damn good the coffee was, it tasted like how coffee actually smells, and I've had coffee since that my dad has said is good quality, and I trust his judgment but it tastes no where near the level of this regular looking coffee machine coffee. 

Any help greatly appreciated I desperately want to try it again it's the only coffee I've genuinely loved the taste of


Update: I found the brand and the actual beans are available for purchase! I found an old stamp card that I had in my wallet from a while back. I'm 100% sure this is the same company, so this should be the same coffee, but there's still a chance the shop used different beans

So I 25F got ghosted by my 33M situationship, the thing is we’ve been seeing each other casually for 2 years,  neither of us made the step to know the other, or I’d say I followed his energy because at first I was suggesting like let’s have coffee together let’s kind of make a friendship at least but his actions made it clear that he doesn’t want anything. so like for two years we see each other like once every 4 weeks to two months just for some casual stuff, and every time I needed a break or to back away i made sure to let him know and not just ghost, things were tiring in moments like when i try to see him casually he refuses with the excuse that he’s with his friends, He’s not available, but when it comes to him every time he wants to see me I should be available, so sometimes I got overwhelmed, and I wanted to back away and we kind of parted ways two times in the span of two years. 
The thing is, he made sure that I respect his boundaries and stuff and i did but when I put a boundary, he took it personally and like he started acting weird, my boundary was I would not invite him to my place or any other man,  if there is not even slightest friendship between us, I told him if this bothers him and he wants to stop things here I am ready to respect his decision so he just need to tell me,  he said it does bother him, but he’s gonna respect my decision, and then he made a weird comment that we should act strangers in the streets, but know each other in the  sheets, we’re literally neighbors We could see each other at any moment in the Neighbourhood.
So  the thing is this last conversation happened last summer and then we saw each other in August he told me he’s  going on vacation and coming back on September 4th but he ghosted me so when he came back, he didn’t text me to tell me that yeah he came back he ghosted me since, for 4 months now and last night he unfollowed me. 
I feel so weird about it like why would someone do that, he didn’t even bother letting me know that he’s kind of done so the thing is, I want to text him and tell him that he didn’t even have the balls to tell me that he’s done and wants to move onto something else, so what do you think guys should I do it or should I leave the ghost alone??

“I’m not a carrier pigeon!!!”

These are words that you don’t expect to hear from a Project Manager.

We laugh about it now, but when exasperated PM Marcus blurted this out after leaving a meeting, it was a cry for help.

**CARRIER PIGEON PM SYNDROME**

At Stoneseed, we have a unique and privileged insight.

Through our [Project Management as a Service (PMaaS)](https://www.stoneseed.co.uk/project-management-as-a-service/) engagements we get to work with organisations of all shapes and sizes, from all sectors. We see them at their best, and, as [PMaaS](https://www.stoneseed.co.uk/project-management-as-a-service/) can occasionally be an emergency rescue service, often at their worst too.

More and more, we meet project managers whose main job seems to be delivering messages up, down, here, there and everywhere across the project ecosystem! They share team updates with leadership, relay vendor reminders, escalate client issues, but rarely get to interpret, challenge, or influence any of it. They cannot ask questions, clarify intent, or argue for a different perspective. What a waste!!!

They are voiceless messengers … although seemingly without the protection of the old adage – “Don’t shoot the messenger.”

The result? Projects stall and talent burnout is quick to follow, not from the complexity of projects, but from the suffocating lack of agency and engagement.

**HYPOSTRESS**

Marcus the PM would eventually be signed off work with something I had never even heard of: hypostress.

Hypostress happens when a person doesn’t have enough stimulation, challenge, or engagement in life. It’s the stress of boredom, of having nothing that pushes you, excites you, or gives you a sense of purpose.

Your brain and emotions work like muscles. With less use, they weaken! As PMs we need a bit of challenge and excitement to stay healthy.

Marcus would joke that while peers suffered burn-out, he’d get bored-out!

Elsewhere, at another [PMaaS](https://www.stoneseed.co.uk/project-management-as-a-service/) engagement, the project manager was embedded specifically to “improve communications.” The reality: their days were spent collecting daily reports from teams and dispatching them, unedited and unquestioned, to executives who barely glanced at them. Major risks went unchallenged, because the PM was never asked for an interpretation, only a transmission. Only when a critical deadline was missed did leadership demand answers, by which point problems had grown too large (and too expensive) to fix quickly.

Cases like this, and Marcus’, have revealed a truth that’s as frustrating as it is universal: most project disasters aren’t about technical failure, they’re about failures in communication. Yet too often, organisations unknowingly force their project managers into the role of silent messengers—carrier pigeons, tasked with shuttling information but never trusted to speak up.  


**ROOT CAUSES: WHY DO ORGANISATIONS CREATE CARRIER PIGEON PMS?**

The patterns are familiar:

* Command-and-control cultures where decisions live at the top.
* Fear of transparency that keeps honest dialogue buried.
* Underinvestment in governance, forcing PMs to act as human buffers.

When PMs can’t speak or interpret, risks balloon, silos persist, and communication either floods everyone or starves those who need it most.

**BEST PRACTICE**

At Marcus’ current organisation, the culture is very much geared towards PMs having a voice and being encouraged to lean into their experience for the benefit of project and business outcomes.

We ‘ve all done Post-Mortems on our IT Projects, the lessons from failure are vital going forward. Marcus’ new team is so eager to learn, they go in search of the learnings before the project even has had a chance to fail!

“It’s learning from failure before the failure happens. Why wait for the mistake to occur to get the lesson? We are encouraged to predict why our project will fail if we continue down this course.”

A protocol has evolved where everyone is encouraged to flag current or potential issues and everyone else gets to vote them up or down (and/or leave a comment) This way, the things most people agree are real risks naturally rise to the top. It’s a lightweight way to surface what actually matters because as Marcus says, “The hive usually knows where the real problems are hiding.”

Of course, the right culture is crucial, as Marcus told me, “If someone speaks up about a risk, and they catch heat for it from the colleague closest to it, as a culture we need to have their back, or they won’t speak up again. What they are highlighting won’t necessarily turn out to be right, but they cared enough to say something. That’s celebrated and encouraged!”

“Nine times out of ten, the issue raised is on the radar of the relevant PM, but occasionally a piece of project gold is unearthed.”

Engagement scores on the annual staff survey are high, and best of all Marcus hasn’t had a day off sick in years.

**HOW TO AVOID THE CARRIER PIGEON TRAP**

Three key takeaways:

**Empowerment:** Before engaging a PM, clarify the decision rights, escalation paths, and level of authority for project managers. PMs must be able to do more than pass notes.

**Openness:** Insist on governance forums where PMs can surface risks, pose questions, and drive issue resolution. Don’t let silence be your default.

**Outcome-Focused Approach:** Align KPIs and service-level agreements with meaningful project outcomes, not just message throughput. When PMs are measured by impact—not just the speed of their deliveries—the value of insight, challenge, and interpretation is obvious.

And lastly, an obligatory nod to the benefits of [Project Management as a Service.](https://www.stoneseed.co.uk/project-management-as-a-service/)

**PMaaS: TRANSLATORS, NOT COURIERS**

The best PMaaS partnerships can be transformational. We’ve seen what happens when PMs are treated as full project leaders: empowered to ask questions; challenge priorities; and convene cross-functional conversations.

Delivery accelerates, blockages shrink, morale soars.

At one SaaS provider, Stoneseed’s [PMaaS](https://www.stoneseed.co.uk/project-management-as-a-service/) project managers succeeded in getting invited into executive standups (not previously the case for inhouse PMs there) and were authorised to challenge the conventional, suggest better ways and trusted to shape delivery.

Our team doesn’t have “company baggage” holding them back! Now in-house PMs there don’t either, nor do they just move messages! They have meaningful roles.

**COOOO-NCLUSION: LET YOUR PMs HAVE A VOICE**

Projects succeed when information flows, but only when that information is meaningful, contextual, and open to challenge.

When you relegate your PMs to the role of carrier pigeons, your organisation loses not just communication, but understanding, risk management, and ultimately, control over outcomes.

[Stoneseed’s PMaaS](https://www.stoneseed.co.uk/project-management-as-a-service/) offers strategic agility and organisational depth, robust governance and operational resilience, but only when PMs can speak, lead, and build.

Yet none are interested in me. Then on the other end I have been told I'm not ambitious enough, Don't have the looks, the money, or the connections for a real woman.

I am a shy, introverted guy. I don't like crowds or large gatherings. I do like going to concerts or other events but its draining. I have never gone clubbing or Bar diving/hopping and probably never will as im not interested in such things.

1p2v6u9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p2v6u9,"THE WAY WILLIAMEST AND JOONGDUNK FANDOM ARE PRETENDING. IT’S SO CUTE: HOW EST, SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WANTED TO DO FANSERVICE WITH WILLIAM, ACCIDENTALLY (OR VERY INTENTIONALLY, WHO KNOWS) REVEALED THAT WILLIAM WAS ACTUALLY DRIVING HIM… TO PICK UP JOONG AT THE AIRPORT, Tuesday 18/11/2025.","Hi JEms. 

Alright, today we’re analyzing the comedy of the week: how Est, simply because he wanted to do fanservice with William, accidentally (or very intentionally, who knows) revealed that William was actually driving him… to pick up Joong at the airport.

Yes. All of this because he wanted to act like a Passenger Prince.

Let’s begin.

⸻

🛫 1. Joong goes to Chiang Mai (or Lampang, pick your flavor)

On Monday the 17th, Joong was in Chiang Mai.
Or Lampang. Those two cities are practically glued together anyway.

He posted that his flight was an hour long, which confirms he left Bangkok that day (or the day before).
He also took a little social media break.
And honestly? It felt good. It felt good that he listened. When he breathes, we breathe.

And no matter which airport he used, all flights land in the same airport, so we’re not doing a geography thesis here.

⸻

🚗 2. November 18: Est posts THE video

On November 18, Est posts a video in the car with William.
Classic fanservice:

“Look at me being a cute little prince on the passenger seat…”

The issue?
When he turns the phone, we clearly see they’re heading to the airport. In Din Daeng.

Which airport?
The one in Din Daeng, Don Mueang Airport.

And you even see the Rama IX Road sign.
Case closed.
 And just guess who ate the same time was in this airport! 
I know it’s so hard… just guess.
⸻

🕒 3. Timings don’t lie

Est posts his video → 20:07
Joong posts his arrival → 21:53

Flights from Chiang Mai → Bangkok take:
1 hour to 1h20.
Joong said it himself.

Meaning:
Est leaves at 20:07 → Joong lands an hour later → they go home together.

If Joong left his car at the airport, it’s still there.
So Est goes to get him → they drive home in Joong’s car.

And for the people who still struggle to connect two brain cells:
the reason Est didn’t take his own car is because Joong left his at the airport. So when Est arrives, they go back home together in Joong’s car, and William goes back with the manager.
Easy. Simple. Kindergarten-level logic.

William goes back with the manager.
As usual.

⸻

🧢 4. The manager… oh my God

The manager tried to “save the situation” by reposting the story but hiding the destination.
Hilarious.
It actually made the situation worse.

Same energy as when he tried to cover up Est’s bathtub accident, with Joong’s feet in the reflection.
He should stop.
He keeps making it worse.

⸻

🛬 5. The next day… radio silence

Of course.
As if someone had… come home.
I’m saying nothing, but I’m saying everything.

⸻

🏢 6. Visual proof: THE CEILINGS about the airport.

Same ceilings, same columns, same layout.
The airport where Est was going = the airport where Joong filmed Pond at the same hour.
Same place.
Identical twins.

⸻

✨ 7. And the dessert: the matching posts

The next day, Joong posts a picture that copies the exact layout of Est’s previous table picture.
Same vibe, same setup.
Est posts “Orange Café”.
Joong posts Orange Café too.
Like coded communication between soulmates.

But sure, ignore all the signs.

⸻

🧠 8. Accident or on purpose?

Did Est post it by accident?
Did he do it on purpose?
Who knows.

Both are possible when someone is happy.

⸻

📝 9. PS

This clue wasn’t found by me.
Someone else noticed it.
I’m too busy these days to track everything.
Credit goes to them. Thank you very much honey. Love you.❤️✨❤️


So: 
But…
Let’s start with something absolutely hilarious: the way some of you genuinely believe that the managers are the ones giving “credibility” to your little fantasy relationships. Babe… no. If anything, the manager’s constant presence proves the exact opposite, that there is absolutely nothing going on between William and Est. Nothing. Zero. Void. Empty. Sahara.

But what it does prove is that the manager is working overtime covering every tiny little slip that Est makes. And honestly? That’s what makes everything even more obvious. Did you see how William avoids to post anything? Yeah it’s because of this kind of mistakes. William is so young…and at this age, love is incredible 😏 if you understand what I means, you understand.

I swear, our fandom has detectives better than the FBI. I feel so comfortable with all of you. Send me everything you find, every screenshot, every video, every little clue. I need you. I can’t see everything, especially right now. I’m so busy. I’ve missed so much. So please, feel free to send it all. And if you want it to stay private? It will stay private. You can trust me, I promise.

⸻

Now, let me address the denial going on in the WilliamEst fandom. The level of delusion is honestly award-winning at this point. Est, by pure accident or on purpose , who knows exposed himself so badly that he practically published a breaking news headline saying:

“I’m going to the airport to pick up my man.”

And the irony? The delicious irony?
He exposed all that while literally sitting in the car of the guy you think is his boyfriend/husband/partner-for-life. To go pick up Joong the same Joong you insult daily? Yeah truth hurts.😂

Be serious for once.

And Joongdunk Why are you insulting Est? Because he’s in a relationship with Joong it’s funny.

Make it make sense.

⸻

Let me break it down. Slowly. Patiently. Like explaining shapes to kindergarten children:
	1.	Est had a full day of work.
	2.	He still made time to go to the airport.
	3.	He did not bring his own car.
(Congratulations to the kindergarteners who guessed why: because Joong’s car was already at the airport.)
	4.	Est sat in William’s car, yes, the same William you insist is his boyfriend.
	5.	William drove him…
	6.	…to go pick up Joong, yes, the same Joong, Est have dating rumors with.

So William drove his “boyfriend” to pick up his actual boyfriend.
If that’s not peak comedy, I don’t know what is.

Then what?
Simple: Est and Joong went home together in private, and William went back with the manager like a good supportive bestie.

⸻

And don’t even get me started on what happened the next day. Joong literally set up the breakfast table exactly like Est did in his latest post. I screamed. I ascended. I saw the light.

Then Est song mentions “orange coffee”, and guess what Joong goes and makes that same day?
Orange. Coffee.
As if Est wasn’t basically inviting us to join them on their little orange-coffee date.

At this point, if you still deny it, it’s not confusion, it’s just bad faith.
You don’t like Joong because he’s with Est.
And you don’t like Est because he’s with Joong.
You’re incredible and that’s why you’re not their fans, you 
That’s it. That’s the whole truth. Own it.

Let’s be brutally honest here: the reason you hate Joong is because he’s with Est, and the reason you hate Est is because he’s with Joong. Your two fandoms are not “protective,” you’re just mad that reality doesn’t match your fanfiction. That’s it. That’s the whole plot twist.

You know how I can tell you’re not real fans?
Because you’re not happy when the person you claim to love is happy. A real fan doesn’t break down because their idol is loved, protected, and emotionally stable. 

A real fan wants peace for them, even if tomorrow they date someone else. Meanwhile, you? You want to sabotage their relationship because it ruins your fantasies. That’s not love. That’s selfishness.

Try, for one second, to imagine being in their place. Being in love, seeing thousands of people actively trying to erase your partner because it doesn’t please their shipping preferences. Do you understand how cruel that is? Do you even realize how much it hurts when strangers want to destroy the person you love?

The way some of you desperately try to create problems between them… it’s embarrassing. Truly. And spoiler alert: it’s not going to work. Whether you approve or not, reality is not waiting for your permission.

And the funniest part?

You’re mad because Est’s real partner isn’t your fantasy. You need the “fake ships,” the corporate-made pairings, the on-screen coworkers. As if you, personally, date your coworkers. 

Even a kindergarten child knows their dad doesn’t date his colleague because they film videos together. 
But here you are, grown adults 18, 20, 30, 50 , believing William and Est are secretly married because they touched shoulders on camera. What exactly is broken inside those brains?

Here’s a truth bomb for free:
Most BL actors date in real life. Many date women. Yes, women. Reality isn’t obligated to follow your fanfiction.

Being a fan means supporting what makes them happy.
If Joong loves Est, then Joong’s fandom should respect Est.
If Est loves Joong, then Est’s fandom should respect Joong.
If you don’t want to? Fine. They’re still together. Your feelings are not part of the relationship contract.

And the WilliamEst fandom? Let’s be honest: that’s a daycare. A group of kids who just discovered that men can kiss on screen and suddenly think every BL ship is real. 

They cheer for men kissing in a drama, but the moment they find out Est actually has a real boyfriend, suddenly they choke. Suddenly they hate Joong. Suddenly homosexuality only exists inside a series but not outside. The level of hypocrisy is unbelievable.

But the saddest part?
You want their real love to break just to feed your imaginary one. You want to destroy something real to protect something that never existed. And never will.

Because one day, the ships will fade.
The contracts will end.
The series will finish.
The hype will pass.
Most of you will move on to new actors.

But Joong and Est?
They’re building something that lasts. They will have a life, a home, memories, their stability , long after Dunk and William have moved on, long after the BL trend cools down, long after the fandom reshuffles for the 100th time.

And the idea that you want to tear that down just to satisfy your fantasies… it’s pathetic. And cruel.

You may think it’s cool to insult them, to act like “bold” fans, to flex how rude you can be. But trust me: that trend dies fast. The “savage fan” era ages horribly. In five years, nobody will remember your tweets. But Joong and Est?
They will remember the damage you tried to do.

And guess what?
They’ll still be together.

⸻

Like Wedgies 
Your idol literally makes time, after work! to go pick Joong up from the airport.
Even though Joong could have gone home perfectly fine by himself.
But no. Est said: “I’ll go get him.”
And he went.
In William’s car.
Because comedy must live.

What kills me is how obsessed some of you are with Joong. I know that yall understood immediately that Est was on this airport for Joong. You know everything about this guy. Everything…

So obsessed that you immediately recognized he was the one Est was going to pick up…
…but somehow skipped that question on purpose because you didn’t want to face reality.

I’m sorry, but that’s hilarious.

Est didn’t even do it on purpose or he did…😏
If he hadn’t been doing fanservice, we would never have known he was on the way to pick up his man.
So thank you fanservice! You finally did something useful.

⸻

Anyway, let’s all wait for New Year’s vacations now.
Let’s see where Est and Joongdunk magically appear coincidentally together this time.
I’m already laughing in advance.


_______

CONCLUSION:

So, to wrap this masterpiece of accidental reveals: Est tried to do a simple fanservice moment, and instead he ended up exposing an entire relationship dynamic, a logistical operation, a car-sharing system, and two fandoms’ collective denial issues. Honestly? Iconic behavior.

At this point, the signs aren’t “subtle clues” anymore, they’re traffic lights, billboards, and airport arrival screens screaming “THEY ARE TOGETHER.” And if you still don’t see it, that’s not blindness. That’s a personal decision.

Meanwhile, Est is out here being chauffeured by the man you claim is his husband… to go pick up the actual man he’s dating. Joong is decorating breakfast tables like Est, making orange coffees on command, and basically writing “I MISS MY BOYFRIEND” in invisible ink across social media.

But sure. Continue denying.
The rest of us will just be here enjoying the comedy show for free.

New Year’s is around the corner.
Let’s see where the two lovebirds teleport next.

I’m bringing popcorn.


Ok, bye Laura.

The split criteria is an AHI of 5 or more for adults and an AHI of 1 or more for pediatrics. The rooms are tiny! The beds are pushed against the wall and only have about 2-3 feet between the bed and the wall. No gurney would be able to fit into the room and would be almost impossible to do a blanket lift if needed. No AED in lab. No standing order for O2. CPAP masks are old and yellow and crusty. Respiratory belts are old and most don’t work. No extra pulse ox if one were to break and we still use sandman. Cameras work intermittently and no mics in the room so we can’t hear our patients. If cameras are down we would have no idea what’s going on in the patients rooms. Beds are a size full and they always tell patients they can bring a plus 1 to sleep in the bed with them. 3:1 ratio and sometimes you have 2-3 peds per tech. One time, Dr asked me to do a sleep study without eeg leads because patient didn’t want to take her scarf off her head. Paychecks aren’t allowed to be cashed, they can only be deposited into an account and no direct deposit. Used CPAP masks are to be cleaned in a boiler for 30 minutes not Control III. No water or coffee for techs. No gloves, barely have enough supplies.",3,1763720819.0,SleepTechnologist,6,0.81,False
