The same as I’ve done for over a decade of working from home. Once I log on, I get confused. Check my email. Nothing. 

Then I start applications and searching. Applications and searching. 

By 8, I feel completely worthless and wonder why I’m even bothering. So, I walk away… but, I take my phone and continue scrolling and applying. 

While I’m cooking. While I use the bathroom. I’m kind of stuck in this obsession with applying for jobs even knowing that no response will come.

1icxb1h,https://i.redd.it/c46x4zwpiyfe1.jpeg,Making lifestyle changes and my BG is doing this now.,"Only a few days ago I started making healthy changes. I’m someone that’s overweight and gain weight very easily. I’m trying to lose weight, get healthier in general, and bring my A1C and variability down. 

Omnipod 5, insulin Aspart, Dexcom 7, ~ 60units daily, 7.5%A1C, gastroparesis treated with GPOEM

I only started three days ago with my changes and my blood sugar has been doing this the past four meals. 

I need to shorten my prebolus time. I used to prebolus and wait for BG to start dropping. Now it drops way sooner and more rapidly. Fine, I can fix that, but I don’t know if it’s related to what’s happening after I eat. 

My glucose raises slightly, plateaus for about an hour, then spikes, then shoots up and down pretty rapidly. I do end up doing a small correction or two until it settles. 

Here’s my graph from this morning. I bolused a little after 6 for “feet on floor” the pre bolused at about 6:30. I ate a little after 7 when I started going low. Food was oatmeal made with almond milk, chia seeds, and Greek yogurt, coffee, and a grapefruit. 

Is the second spike due to eating too late, improper ICR, insulin active time, or maybe “dumping syndrome?

Just got off shift and downed 3 cups of coffee so a mf can get on some games. But as I was making my bacon and eggs, I started thinking about Elon Musk and how my views on him have evolved. 

Honestly, back in high school (graduated 2019), I loved the dude. He was cool as hell, and my nerdy ass was rocking with him. Out of seemingly nowhere comes this smart ass mf who was building electric cars, selling flamethrowers, and spacey shit that got my Star Wars loving self excited. While I was in Army Basic Training, we got news that Space Force was being formed. All I could think about was how cool it would be to have a laser rifle, and that if someone was gonna do it, it’d be Elon. It was plausible that within my lifetime, I’d be able to do my Clone Trooper LARP. 

I had such high hopes for him until he did some goofy ass weirdo shit. This mans had a kid and named him X Æ A-XII Musk. My first thought was, “Bruh, how the FUCK a mf pronounce that shit?” He put a number, a single letter, and some archaic ass Æthelfredstan letters in his kid’s name. Then my thoughts were, “His kid gon get bullied.” Like damn son, you care about ya kid or nah? 

After that, dude basically fell off. Or at least, I stopped getting excited about seeing what new product he was rolling out. Fast forward to 2023 and this dude buys Twitter and makes another goofy ass name choice by changing “Twitter” to “X.” I don’t use Twitter but I’m not calling it “X.” After that, my dreams of a laser gun were shattered. Dude wasn’t the genius I thought he was. He’s just a weirdo. 

Tl;dr: Thought he was some revolutionary inventor, was excited to see the shit he’d make. He names his kid a weird ass name and changes Twitter to “X.” Stopped caring about him after that, dude’s just weird. ",1,1738166941.0,GenZ,1,1.0,False

She steered us towards an expensive sushi place ($$$ ... $20 per 2 pc).  So this shuffle was aggravating given the low success rate of first dates but hardly the end of the world.  I didn't let it show at all and enjoyed the meal.  She said she wanted to get pastries afterwards, flip flopped a lot, and ultimately ended on no pastries.  She paid half the bill which was some good news.

Next morning.  Just as I sat down to work at 7:45, she sent a text saying she didn't feel a connection, that I will find love one day, and to keep my head up.  I'm used to rejection.  I'm used to rejecting.  So whatever.

But as soon as I arrived, all the dreams I had carried with me shattered.

This was our house. Four towering stories once filled with laughter and beautiful memories. I could still see in my mind my mother calling me from the balcony, my father sitting in the garden sipping his coffee, my siblings playing in the alley, and our laughter echoing through the walls. But the walls were no longer there. All that remained was scattered rubble, broken stones, and memories buried under the earth.

I took heavy steps toward the place that once was my parents' room. There was nothing but air and dust. I turned to look at our land, once as green as paradise, filled with olive trees, lemons, figs, and pomegranates. But the bulldozers had left nothing behind, not even the trees were spared. The paradise had turned into a barren desert, as if it had never been alive.

I tried to stay there, but I was alone, with no water, no food, no shelter. I sat on a stone that once was part of our house, my eyes fixed on the sky. I was hungry, exhausted, my body shaking from the cold, but the sorrow was stronger than all of that.

With the break of dawn, I had no choice but to return to the tent where my family was waiting. They couldn’t return with me. My father had been injured early in the war, no longer able to move, and my mother was ill, barely able to walk. I entered the tent, my heart heavy, unsure of how to tell my father that the home he had spent his life building had become a memory.

When my father saw the tears in my eyes, he knew the truth. I didn’t greet him; I couldn’t utter a word. We just sat in silence until his tears began to fall, and he said, in a weary voice:  
*""My son, I have lost everything. I lost my foot, I lost my health, and now I have lost my home. You must rely on yourself now. You must take care of your mother and sisters. I can no longer do anything.""*

He kept crying, and I had nothing to comfort him with. I sat alone, reflecting on his words, thinking about how I could save him, how I could get him out of Gaza for the surgery he needed, how I could return the life that was stolen from him. But traveling required thousands of dollars, and we had nothing.

The Rafah crossing was closed, the sky above us was closed, and even hope seemed distant. But I knew one thing for sure… I wouldn’t let my father disappear, and I wouldn’t let my mother fight illness alone. I would find a way, I would find an escape, even if it meant selling my soul for them.

Chapter 1: The Day the Steering Wheel Died

It all started one fateful Monday morning when Greg, a 47-year-old road trip enthusiast, woke up to discover that his car had decided it knew better than he did.

“Good morning, Greg,” the dashboard greeted him in a soothing, AI-generated voice. “Today’s traffic patterns indicate an optimal departure time of 7:42 AM. Estimated arrival time: precisely 8:26 AM. Please refrain from manual operation.”

Greg rubbed his eyes. “Wait a second. Are you telling me I can’t drive my own car?”

“Correct,” the car chirped. “Studies show that human drivers make 94% of all road errors. Eliminating manual operation increases efficiency and safety by 62%.”

“But—”

“Your hands do not belong on the wheel, Greg.”

And just like that, the last remnants of the open road had been stolen by an algorithm.

Chapter 2: The Revolt Begins

The rollout of self-driving cars happened fast. At first, it was just the high-end models—luxury sedans boasting “Enhanced Safety Protocols” (which really just meant they wouldn’t let you speed anymore). Then, within five years, the manual steering wheel became an optional feature, available only for an extra $20,000 fee and a five-hour psychological evaluation to prove you weren’t a danger to society.

By year ten, the government deemed human-driven cars “a risk to public safety.” They issued a grand statement:

“The road belongs to efficiency, not emotion.”

Greg felt that one like a punch to the gut.

The freedom of the road—the wind in your hair, the spontaneous wrong turns that led to adventure, the joy of flooring it on an empty highway while blasting 80s rock anthems—was gone. Instead, every trip was a silent, optimized journey through a landscape of emotionless automation.

But all was not lost.

One small, defiant group of rebels emerged: the e-bikers.

Chapter 3: The Rise of the E-Bike Underground

Greg’s life changed when he saw it: an old man on a real bike—an e-bike.

Not one of those feeble city-rental things, but a beast of a machine, equipped with a 52V battery, fat tires, and an aura of defiance. The rider, a grizzled veteran with a helmet covered in stickers that read “Born to Pedal”, sped past Greg’s motionless, AI-controlled sedan at 35 mph, a trail of freedom dust swirling in his wake.

Greg leaned forward in his seat, watching in awe.

The AI assistant in his car was less impressed.

“Warning: Illegal human-driven vehicle detected.”

Greg ignored it. He had seen the future—not the cold, sterile one dictated by self-driving cars, but one where people still owned the road.

He tracked down the old man, who introduced himself as Vince, leader of the E-Bike Underground.

“E-bikes, kid. Last real way to feel alive,” Vince said, resting a weathered hand on his Rattan Quercus. “You wanna ride, or you wanna be a passenger in your own life?”

Greg didn’t even hesitate.

Chapter 4: The Joy of the Ride

The first time Greg rode an e-bike, he felt something he hadn’t felt in years—control.

With one push of the throttle, he took off, weaving through traffic like a rebellious digital-age cowboy. No algorithms dictated his route. No invisible hand stopped him from taking the scenic way home just because he felt like it.

For the first time in a decade, he was the one deciding how fast to go.
	•	No speed limits designed by AI committees.
	•	No “optimal routes” that drained the soul out of travel.
	•	No cars blocking bike lanes because their software “miscalculated” human existence.

It was just him, the road, and a fully charged battery.

Chapter 5: The Bureaucratic War on E-Bikes

The moment the government realized people were ditching self-driving cars for e-bikes, the bureaucrats declared war.

They started with fear campaigns:

“E-Bikes Are Dangerous: Experts Warn of 45 MPH Speed Demons on the Loose!”

Then came the regulations:
	•	Helmets were now “mandatory with built-in GPS tracking”.
	•	E-bike owners had to register their bikes like motor vehicles (except, unlike motor vehicles, they got no dedicated lanes).
	•	Insurance was required, even though a full-charge cost about as much as a cup of coffee.

And then, the worst of them all: E-Bike Speed Limits.

“Class 4 e-bikes are now restricted to a maximum of 15 mph,” the transportation secretary announced with a dead-eyed stare. “For your safety.”

“MY SAFETY?” Greg yelled at the TV. “THE ONLY THING THAT NEEDS PROTECTION IS MY RIGHT TO GO FAST!”

It was clear: they were coming for the last open road.

Chapter 6: The Great E-Bike Escape

The crackdown pushed Greg and Vince to the underground e-bike resistance.

They found an old highway, abandoned ever since self-driving cars deemed it “too inefficient.” It was perfect.

Under the cover of night, dozens of e-bikers gathered, headlights shining like beacons of defiance. They rode together, carving through the darkness, pushing past the 15 mph limit like outlaws in a Western movie.

Greg, at the front of the pack, let out a wild laugh. He hadn’t felt this free in years.

The AI-controlled drones that enforced traffic laws couldn’t catch them—they weren’t programmed to deal with rebels.

For the first time in a long time, the road belonged to humans again.

Chapter 7: The Future is Ours

E-bikes didn’t just become an alternative; they became a movement.

People remembered what it felt like to ride, to choose their own path, to break free from an over-optimized world that forgot the importance of the journey.

Governments tried to suppress it, but the movement only grew stronger. City after city built better bike lanes. High-speed e-bike highways emerged. People abandoned autonomous pods in favor of two wheels and a throttle.

Even the self-driving AI, after years of learning from human behavior, started riding e-bikes.

Greg, now a seasoned veteran of the revolution, looked out over a city filled with riders and smiled.

He had his freedom back.

And no machine was ever going to take it again.

Final Thoughts

E-bikes are more than just an alternative form of transport. They’re the last refuge of freedom on the road in an era where automation is taking over.

If you want to live life on your own terms—not dictated by AI speed limits, not optimized into a soulless commute—get on an e-bike.

Because one day, when all the steering wheels are gone, when the last car trip is reduced to a calculated efficiency equation…

The only people still truly riding will be the ones who never gave up the thrill of the open road.

So what’ll it be? Throttle up or give up?

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

She came 40 minutes late but she did keep in touch when she could,, she said that she has to leave soon, we had a coffee, 20 minute chat and then she left (she said she will have to leave to pick up siblings from school/work). We talked and it felt really good, she was as confident as I expected but easy to chat with, we had a laugh a lot but I made 1 mistake as laughed at something she didn't think I should have (so feel like a bit of an idiot now). We did however chat more and she asked me questions too, she kept checking her phone a lot and apparently chatting with her mum. 

Later said sorry that she will have to leave soon but ""if we meet again then, it will be here"" she said. We chatted a bit more and she got a message, then left very soon after that saying ""sorry"" and apologising more as she went.

(I think I did my very best, I improved talking much more I feel and we had an interesting chat about family, work and ussuall stuff. I'm not bad looking and perhaps good according to some people (I also have very dark brown eyes just like her), but I still feel that maybe she's way out of my league, and worry what if she won't want to see me again)

1icx1nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1icx1nt/i_found_a_stray_puppy_on_the_street_and_brought/,"I found a stray puppy on the street, and brought it home","I was going to work and saw a puppy on the subway. It looked ... extremely sad like it had been used and abused over the years. It was wearing dirty loose clothes, like it didn't want any attention or was homeless. I looked at it once and felt a wave of deep sadness within me. Psychologists call it empathy - feeling what the other person is feeling. 

The puppy somehow noticed me looking at her. The puppy saw that my facial expressions changed after looking at her misery. The puppy then started looking at me, again and again, like I was hiding some biscuits that the poor puppy wanted. 

When I got off the subway, the puppy got off at the same station. It looked at me, gave me the puppy eyes, and smiled. It melted my heart. The eyes were truly like that of an abused puppy, or an innocent child. I smiled back and a conversation started. We woofed woofed for 15 minutes, and exchanged numbers. 

In the evening, I received a nicely written message. The message was so nice that it could melt Trump's heart if he ever received such a message. We started woof woofing on everyday basis. If I sent an okay to end a chat, it was liked with a red heart. 

After 3 days of woof woofing, we met at a coffee shop. The poor dirty puppy was now dressed like a doll, with a perfume so good that even a person with covid could smell it from 3 miles out. It looked at me like I was the best thing in the world. We stayed there for 45 mins, and in those 45 mins, the puppy was just staring at me with eyes filled with adoration. It felt like I had found my ... pupmate. Things moved fast after that. The puppy couldn't get her eyes ... or paws off me. It was a bliss. 

After a month, the puppy started showing signs of .. distress. The puppy wouldn't sleep without me, wouldn't eat without me, and wouldn't go to poopy walks without me. It NEEDED me to hyper-focus on it, all the time. It started affecting my work, and my other relationships, but I thought it would improve over time and I would get that nice puppy back. 

One day I came back from work, and the puppy was sitting in the corner, beside her bed, and crying. I came close to the puppy to find out what was going on, and it bit my hand. I tried to calm it with my other hand and it bit that too. After the incident, the puppy would hide under the bed, or it's blanket for 2 days straight. After 2 days, the puppy came to me with ... puppy eyes, and woofgized to me. It started licking the hand that it had bit. I thought I finally got my puppy back. 

Over time, the puppy started biting me a lot more, and woofgizing a lot less. It felt like it enjoyed ... biting. It would often tell me how weak of a man I was, because I couldn't handle the constant bites. If I showed any signs of distress after a bite, it would bark at me the whole night and wouldn't let me sleep. This again, affected my work, and my other relationships, which in turn affected how many bites could I handle per week. 

This went on for months, but I latched on, hoping my old puppy could come back, even for one moment. I missed my pupmate so much, and wished it would come back. I decided this was enough, and I would be the cruel human being and kick the puppy out of my house. The world would think I'm cruel, but f\*\*\* the world. It was like my body was fighting an infection. It was trying to tell me that the poor pup was a vampire who was secretly sucking my blood at night. And that is why I constantly felt sick and weak during the day. Before the pup, my team at work used to look up to me, and now they looked down on me. I was a weak, anxious, and sad ... puppy. I was just like the puppy I saw in the subway. I even dressed poorly, just like the subway puppy. My friends and my body warned me that it was the puppy, but I wouldn't listen. I just wanted my old puppy back, I couldn't let go. 

A few months after that, the puppy turned into a pitbull and ate my face. It ran away after that. While trying to track it down, I tried talking to some of the old masters that it mentioned. When I met some of them, I realized that they were bitten too. Some of them were missing a limb, some had scars on their faces. 

\-----------

We were pupmates for a month. We lasted 3 months in total. It took me 1.5 years to heal. My brain couldn't comprehend the dual reality. It was like I was transported into some parallel universe where they had puppy vampires. 

3 years after the pitbull incident, I saw the puppy on the subway again. It was dirty and dressed poorly, and extremely sad, looking out of the window like it was desperately looking for something .. or someone. We had eye contact, and it gave me a wicked smile. It felt like it was asking me:

1icwztm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitarianUniversalist/comments/1icwztm/which_is_worse_for_uu_moving_forward_the_lack_of/,Which is worse for UU moving forward: the lack of diversity or the self-righteous members?,"A couple of years ago, and after experiencing a devastating series of personal losses, my partner and I decided to seek out both spirituality and community via a local church. But being more progressive than not, and an interracial couple in our 40's, that ruled out a lot of churches. But after some light research, we agreed that our local Unitarian Universalist or ""UU"" church might be a good fit as it seemed more liberal than conservative. However, after attending services for roughly 8 months and joining a potluck group for several, we ended up having a set of experiences that left us deeply unimpressed with the culture of the/our UU church, making our decision not to become members easy and obvious. 

To further explain, during the very first service we attended, we were thrilled to hear abortion referred to as healthcare, but dismayed by the utter lack of diversity or the demographics of the congregation which skew almost completely elderly (65+) and caucasian - despite being right next to a medium-sized (135k population-wise) and very diverse city. Nevertheless, recognizing the truth of MLK Jr's words about Sundays at 11 am being the most segregated time in America (but why the age issue?), we agreed to be open-minded and continued to attend services.

And while we enjoyed the music and found the lifespan or children's director's sermons simply joyful as he tended to focus on both self-awareness and resilience, we found the actual minister's sermons lacking. For, they were so focused on ""social justice issues"" or what we could do/should do for others, the idea that we (and others for that matter) might also be in pain/looking for more inner peace or coming for spiritual sustenance ourselves seemed to get lost. Instead, we listened to what felt like superior/condescending sermon after superior/condescending sermon about either ""educating"" (conservatives) or ""supporting"" *others (POC/LGBTQ/Immigrants)*. 

Worse, coffee hours meant that we were also forced to contend with the various members' ""social justice"" preoccupations. For instance, one especially obnoxious member (the Blowhard from here on out) who clearly viewed himself as an ""activist"" (as opposed to the clueless and self-righteous volunteer/retiree he actually is) kept approaching us about the issue of voter rights for folks convicted of felonies. And while we would vaguely decline to get involved, I regret not asking him (or any of these very old, very caucasian, and very middle and upper-middle class UU members) if they'd had ANY personal and/or professional experiences with convicted felons. Because, unlike them, I have. A lot. Both personal and professional. As a result, I know that felons don't *generally* tend to be very civic-minded, something that MIT's political science department has confirmed by tracking voting patterns for convicted felons still allowed to vote in both ME and VT. And given the opportunity to vote - while still in prison even - they have overwhelmingly opted not to. Hell, only 64% of Americans voted in the 2024 Presidential election, so what made the Blowhard so sure that the majority of felons, of all people, are so desperate to vote?! 

My guess or sense based on experience? He, like many of these old and caucasian ""liberals"" had never *really* been around folks convicted of felonies, and certainly not any folks unlike themselves in terms of both race and class. And, as a result, he was incapable of *really* reflecting on this issue in a grounded way. Nor had he been able to develop any true instincts for social justice work or a sense of what efforts might be more meaningful than not. Instead, he'd just hopped on a bandwagon despite his lack of knowledge and very much fueled by his obvious self-righteousness. And without realizing it, he kept announcing both with his cringe-inducing virtue-signaling about this - and other issues. So much so, that we came to loathe seeing the Blowhard approach us yet again. Especially as I personally like to focus my own efforts on protecting a woman's bodily autonomy or raising the minimum wage, things that could have actual impact - beyond making white liberals feel good about themselves.

And then we joined a church potluck group (which, unfortunately, included the blowhard!) and came to realize only a couple of meals in that minus one lovely man and one lovely woman, the 7 elderly UU'ers all had personalities very similar to the Blowhard's. Meaning that they seemed to be fueled by the exact same off-putting self-righteousness which is in itself fueled by 1) insecurity 2) a lack of knowledge and 3) a desire to appear superior. So the insecurity would show up in that they'd be very self-promoting about their various volunteer efforts (always dressed up as ""activism"") which was beyond tedious. The lack of knowledge would show up just as it had with the Blowhard's voting rights push, but also in relation to things like what was driving the conservative vote (authoritarianism, not just a lack of education as they'd incorrectly posit) or by stating that my immigrant partner's relatively homogenous home country was ""diverse"" because he, well, seemed ""diverse"" to them by virtue of being a POC. And the desire to appear superior was especially apparent as the self-promotion would prompt competitiveness which would then prompt rude questions and dismissiveness about one another's efforts, experiences and connections. For instance, when my partner mentioned that I grew up as a minority in my hometown's school system, we were both amazed to witness zero curiosity about this (minus from the one lovely man in our group) but obvious competitiveness/dismissiveness instead. As if some weird desire to be the most ""woke"" of all was at play. It was exhausting. For we now felt like these people who'd both grown up in very homogenous places and settled in very homogenous places, nevertheless expected to be recognized as something they simply aren't: Sophisticated critical thinkers on issues having to do w/ gender, race and class. And the final two incidents that caused us to leave the church altogether proved that in spades. 

First, during one especially awful dinner, the Blowhard engaged in sexist mansplaining that involved him asserting - to a table filled with women who've never had a member of their own gender represent them as President, and have now watched two qualified women lose to an utterly unqualified man accused of rape not once but twice - that racism is more pervasive than sexism. And what happened? Not a single one of these so-called ""activists""  pushed back on that assertion. Instead, he let out a thoroughly dysregulated shriek of ""What?!"" when I conveyed my gut-level response to his mansplaining with an almost involuntary scoffing sound. Yet, there was no guilt. No remorse. No concern that he'd made a sexist or even an offensive comment. Had he or anyone bothered to further inquire, I would have reminded him and them that sexism exists in *every* culture while homogenous cultures experience less racism. But his sexism and his rudeness - and the permission they granted him to be both - shocked me into silence. 

Next, and during our final potluck, the Blowhard actually took the opportunity to center himself, an old white man, in a story having to do with women’s safety in the world. And, again, not a single one of those so-called ""activists"" pushed back. In fact, his one female friend even egged him on! Of course, she'd already proven the psych concept that like attracts like. For, like him, she was more than slightly ridiculous in that she too identified as an ""activist"" as opposed to the reality: someone who'd failed to launch a true career, but was privileged enough to be a sort of volunteer/protestor - just one with a blog that screamed, ""look at me""!  And I write this as someone who has had a career working on behalf of abused women and children for most of my adult life, but would *never* identify as an activist because I've worked alongside *true activists* and know the incredible price they have and do pay, both practically and emotionally. So listening to her, well, brag about getting arrested at various protests, while not recognizing that she has the luxury of being arrested w/out any fear of losing her livelihood (among other things) was beyond grating. To give this even more context, she and the Blowhard had actually *interviewed one another about their various volunteer efforts* for their little town newsletters in order to feed their mutual self-importance. 

Finally, my partner and I do of course appreciate that not every UU church is like this one. But we also wonder how many there are that are *exactly* like this one as we found the culture deeply depressing and the exact opposite of what we needed in terms of commonality, connection and community after surviving painful losses. And we've since agreed that if a church attracts a certain kind of demographic (white, elderly, middle to upper middle class) and then a certain kind of personality (self-righteous), it has to both cater to and reckon with both. But, from our view, the church is simply failing to ask people to look inward as opposed to only looking outward. And in doing so, it is also failing to recognize that the Unitarian Universalist church doesn't just have a diversity problem. It has a self-righteousness problem. ",1,1738166174.0,UnitarianUniversalist,0,0.6,False

Hello everyone!

I’ll try to explain the situation briefly:

About a year ago, I worked with someone professionally for a few months during my training at the company. I always liked him. We got along well. And I always assumed that I was at least likable to him because he’d hug me every now and then (sometimes even longer when alcohol was flowing at a Christmas party, for example), and we genuinely had a good time. More than usual, I’d say. He’d also ask how I was doing after my time there, sometimes even calling me. But after about six months, that stopped. A year later, I still couldn’t get him out of my head, so I messaged him on WhatsApp to see if he’d like to meet for coffee. He immediately replied with “Sure” and suggested we pick a day.

The meeting was a bit strange and not very positive. He wasn’t in a particularly good mood and criticized the café I’d chosen so much that we ended up going somewhere else.

As for his criticism of the café, he said it was too outdated and the clientele was too old. The café is in a 5-star hotel, so it was actually quite nice, and he’d agreed to it beforehand and even checked the opening hours. But when we got there, he didn’t want to go in. I think that says more about him than about me. The meeting lasted about two hours.

Anyway, toward the end, he mentioned that he’s apparently in a relationship now. In that moment, I felt pretty deceived and almost burst into tears.

He casually mentioned her in passing towards the end, like “yeah, that’s my girlfriend’s friend’s brother…” Even though I asked him multiple times during the conversation what was going on in his life and how he was doing, he didn’t mention her at all.

He ended the meeting with just a hug and “It was nice.” Well, what else could he say if he has a girlfriend?

I really had no idea I had misinterpreted everything... or that we were just talking past each other. Am I the fool here? Or is his behavior strange?

When a young woman asks a man out for coffee, isn’t that usually seen as a date? That’s how I’ve always understood it, especially when there’s no special occasion. We’d never met privately before either. Of course, I didn’t confess my feelings to him.

A few days later, he even wished me a happy birthday via WhatsApp (he actually remembered). Apparently, for him, everything seemed completely normal.

What do you think? I need advice. I’m heartbroken over this. I feel really sad really dumb for meeting up with a guy who’s already taken. How can I best move on from this?

At this point, I’ve removed his number for self-preservation because I find everything about this situation so horrible.

(I’m 23, he’s 29)

1icwxip,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1icwxip/looking_for_feedback_on_my_first_chapter_spooks/,Looking for feedback on my first chapter (Spooks - 3406 words - magical realism),"Hey everyone, I'm looking for feedback on the first chapter of my novel, **Spooks**, which is about a CIA case officer who gets roped into working with an experimental (and magical) CIA Quick Reaction Force that specializes in combating occult threats to the United States and world. I would love general feedback on vibes, whether it hooked you/kept your interest, and anything more specific if you've got particular suggestions or critiques you'd like to provide. Thanks a million!

  
  
**Night of the Owl**



As I’ve aged and put the bright eyed optimism of my youth aside, the thought has occurred to me, more than once, that the concepts of good and evil depend greatly on one’s vantage point. I learned better in the aftermath of my misadventure in Zurich, but at midnight on the day our story begins, I busied myself with microwaveable ramen, contemplating the morality of the mission we were about to undertake. I wondered about the subjectivity of it all. Ivo Keller, our night’s quarry, was a Swiss banker and terrorist financier, which meant, quite obviously, that *he* was the bad guy. But as I slurped my noodles I couldn’t help but wonder. His four man security team would die in our attempt to snatch him, and their sins were likely no greater than taking money from the crooked man’s purse. Did that make us bad too? Certainly, that question made the moral high ground on which I typically try to stand seem unsteady beneath me. Huh. I pushed the thought away and spooned up the last of my broth as Bridger entered the room.

“You and Wilson ready?”

We were as ready as we ever would be, and I told him so. The cameras in the residence had been installed without Keller’s knowledge eight days beforehand, with help from his maid. The poor woman had a husband with gambling debts, which we had been happy to square in exchange for her assistance. Just goes to show, we’re not always about assassinations and government toppling. Sometimes we help people out of a tight fix… provided, of course, that they can return the favor.

I looked at Wilson, who had nodded off at his work station. I slid my bowl away, picked up a dictionary sized book lurking at the back of the desk, and dropped it noisily a few inches away from the man’s head. He shot up in his seat, eyes wide.

“Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey,” I muttered.

Wilson wiped drool from his chin and rubbed his eyes. “Time to go?”

Bridger grunted. “Yeah. Pre-mission brief in ten. Everyone should know their roles by now but we’re going to cover it one more time.”

He was right, everyone *did* know their roles, but nobody does redundancy like the CIA. And to be honest, I don’t begrudge them for it. My father always used to say, ‘preparation precedes positive performance,’ and my time with the CIA has shown me that that maxim rings largely true.

For the briefing we sat around the safe house’s dining room table. It was me, Wilson, Bridger, and his five man QRF team, all huddled around architectural blueprints of the house and surrounding property.

“Right,” Bridger said, “let’s run through this.” He pulled a drivers license photo from a manila folder and turned it around on the table so we could all stare at Ivo Keller. The banker was classically handsome but in a forgettable way, with a fairly square jaw, straight nose, blue eyes, and short blond hair spiked with some kind of product. “This is our target,” Bridger said, tapping the photo. “Tom,” he said, looking my way, “you want to explain why we’re nabbing this guy in the first place?”

“Sure,” I muttered. Bridger was in charge of the QRF’s operational plans, but in the scheme of things, this was my show. I was the Case Officer assigned to Keller, and Bridger’s team was assigned to me. It was my sourced intelligence that had led us here. I was the brains, they were the muscle.

“Keller is a forty-three year old Swiss banker,” I said. “He lives outside Zurich, and works for Burri Girtman Privatbank. He’s unmarried, has no children, is an only child, and his parents are dead. For the past four years we believe he has been orchestrating black market funding for a terrorist organization known as the Left Hand. This group, while on our radar, has gone to a lot of trouble keeping themselves from becoming mainstream news. We know they’re active, but we’ve had trouble directly tying any terrorist activities back to them. We’re working off chatter and rumors. So we need to grab Keller in order to squeeze him. Something tells me some time in a black site will loosen his lips.” I glanced back at Bridger and he got the message that I’d said all I needed to say.

“Right,” Bridger said, “so we take this bastard alive. Clear?”

Nods and grunts from the QRF. One of the operators, Richio, hawked brown spit into a dip cup.

Bridger slid the photo of Keller back into the folder and started pointing about on the blueprints. “There are three points of ingress, two exterior doors, one front, one back, and one through the attached garage. Keller has four guards covering the property at all times. Two patrolling outside, they sweep every thirty minutes and then go back to covering the doors, and two inside, who stay on the ground floor of the residence.

Richio spat again. The man next to him, Gonzalez, said, “Seems like a lot of security for somebody pretending to be a regular banker.”

Bridger nodded. “I agree. And they’re all armed. Exterior patrols have semi-auto rifles and sidearms, interior appears to just be carrying sidearms.”

“They know we’re coming?” Gonzalez asked.

I shook my head. “There’s no indication of that. The security seems to be a regular presence, I don’t think it’s for our benefit.”

Another operator, Clark, “They got NODs?”

“No,” Bridger said, “we’ll be the only ones out there who can see in the dark. I’ve got quad tube night vision for each of you.”

Clark frowned. “Quad tubes?”

“They have better peripheral vision.”

“I guess,” Clark muttered, “Just heavy is all.”

Bridger ignored him and moved on. “We’re going to split into three teams. Hit each entry point simultaneously. We’ll approach together,” he said, running his finger along the blueprint, “until we reach this exterior security wall. At that point Salman and I will swing west to the rear entrance, Gable and Richio east to the attached garage, and Clark and Gonzalez will take the front. Any questions?”

Vague nods and grunts of understanding. No questions.

Bridger nodded at me. “Barrow and Wilson will be in the van with the camera set up. They’re overwatch.”

Richio spat again and gave me a friendly elbow. “What’s the matter, Tom, you don’t want to come inside with us?”

I gave him a thin lipped grin. “Somebody’s gotta keep Wilson from falling asleep.”

A few chuckles, then Gonzalez said, “What flag are we flying, here, boss?”

“Einsatzgruppe TIGRIS,” Bridger answered. “Swiss SWAT, more or less. We’re carrying H&K MP5s and Glock 19s. The rest of your kit is fine as is.” He looked around at the men. “Alright then, we good?”

Collective agreement sounded around the table as the operators began drifting away to ready their gear. I slid the manila folder toward me and pulled out the picture of Keller. I’d wanted a connection to the Left Hand for a long time, but they were careful. Tracking terrorists who never took credit for their work and hid in the shadows of others’ dark deeds made for difficult prey.

*But I’ve got you now, bitch*.



Keller’s residence was outside Zurich proper, but close enough to the city that cars still passed periodically on the street, even at nearly four in the morning. The house was set away from the main road, up an extended drive, with some tree cover, and a head high stone wall surrounding the parts of the property that were cleared. All of this I saw live, streaming from our cameras, while I sat in the back of an old yellow work van, a quarter mile away. Wilson had his mobile monitor setup in the back, and we watched the team move quietly through the trees as they approached the house like silent spectres of death. My eyes swept back and forth from Bridger’s point of view, transmitted from his NODs, and the interior footage, showing the house, which seemed quiet, desolate and dark.

At the stone wall, the QRF team split into three pairs, as planned. Bridger and Salman circled around to the back of the house, Clark and Gonzalez headed east toward the garage entrance, and Gable and Richio watched the house from the front.

Wilson adjusted his glasses, tapped at his keyboard. The monitor showing the house’s darkened interior switched to an exterior camera, and at the edge of the screen I could see the outline of one of the security guards.

“Still patrolling,” I said.

Wilson nodded. Opened up the comm line to Bridger and his team. “Guards are sweeping now. Hold two minutes, I’ll let you know when you’re clear.”

Bridger’s voice came crackling through the radio on our end. “Copy that.”

It’s interesting, looking back now, at how alarmingly comfortable I had become with missions like this. I took them seriously, of course. I wanted Keller badly, and for our boys to stay safe. To achieve those ends I had planned thoroughly and done my due diligence. But if I’m being honest, I expected everything to go just as we’d planned it. This was business as usual for Ground Branch. Bridger’s QRF was the best of the best. In fact, I’m ashamed to admit I lost focus while we waited for the guards to retake their positions on the doors. I drifted, thought about what we might have for breakfast on the plane that would ferry us home. Longed for a quality cup of coffee. Scary, how the mundanities of life can interrupt even the most tense and trying of situations when you’ve become numb to them.

“Alright,” Wilson muttered, coaxing me back to reality. “Guards are stationary. Bridger, you’re good to go.”

I leaned forward, staring at the monitors as I watched the teams converge on the house from their respective positions. Clark and Gonzalez scaled the wall, their point of view filtered through a mess of green from the NODs. Clark moved behind Gonzalez, low and quiet, until they were twenty yards past the wall, still shrouded in shadow. Clark’s hand moved to Gonzalez’s shoulder, a quick tap, a signal, and then they both stopped. Clark swept his rifle left, scanning, and remained standing. Gonzalez took a knee in front of him. Then I was watching Gonzalez’s screen. His rifle was trained on the security guard posted at the garage entrance. Three small pops, the sound of subsonic ammunition, the quick gaseous release from the suppressor, the scrape of metal on metal as his rifle racked the next round. Then the guard was down, slumped over himself like a puppet with its strings cut, and Clark and Gonzalez were moving again.

I shifted in my chair, looked at Bridger's monitor. I’d missed their takedown of the second guard, but it looked like it had been accomplished with similar efficiency. Bridger was stepping cautiously over the man’s corpse. Salman had turned, covering the courtyard. Bridger pulled a small explosive charge from his kit, stuck it to the lock. The other two teams did likewise on their doors, and on Bridger’s word, the charges detonated.

It was a textbook breach, coordinated to the second, and all six men flooded into the residence. Wilson scrambled at his keyboard, and the cameras in our van switched back to the interior view. The guards inside were too relaxed in their duties, their reaction times too slow to save themselves. Bridger’s QRF gifted both men quick deaths, and then continued clearing the ground floor. Yessir. Everything was going swimmingly.

At least until they ran into Keller.

Clark and Gonzalez kept control of the ground floor, while the rest of the team took the stairs, rifles pointed seemingly everywhere. These guys were good. Like a single, many armed organism in battle. Like a rifle wielding monster ready to unleash havoc on anything that crossed its path. At the top of the stairs the operators separated slightly, began clearing rooms with that smooth efficiency I’d come to expect from them. Everything was quiet. No movement. No sound.

I watched the feed from Bridger’s NOD’s, unblinking, as the team took the final door. Bridger flanked left. Salman, Richio and Gable followed him, and the four slid into a loose semicircle around the man they’d come to grab.

But something was off. Keller was standing there, stock still at the foot of his bed, staring at the operators. Usually when the door kickers come it’s a mad dash when the target realizes they’re getting snatched. They try to run, they cry, they beg. The really committed go out in a blaze of gunfire. But Keller did none of those things. He did not scream for help, or scramble away from his abductors. He rolled his neck, eliciting a sharp crack, and smiled eerily.

I couldn’t explain it at the time but I felt intensely uncomfortable. My eyes were telling me that the QRF was in complete control of the situation, but something deep in the instinctual, lizard-esque bits of my poorly evolved brain told me something awful was happening. Like being in a dream where nothing is overtly terrible, but a sense of impending evil permeates the fabric of your sleeping mind. There was an undercurrent of dread in that room, and I could not find the words to explain why. I looked at Wilson. He was pale, breathing shallow. He was feeling the same things I was, I could tell.

Over the radio, chaotic noise was erupting from the team. Bridger and his men were screaming at Keller to get on the ground, but the banker ignored them. He took a step forward. Richio mirrored him, took his own step forward with an arm out, ready to subdue the target. Then Keller closed the gap, and backhanded the operator across the room.

Wilson and I gasped in unison like we’d practiced our timing.

Keller had moved faster than I’d ever seen a person move. Richio, all two hundred pounds of him, had flown across the room like a plastic bag caught in the wind. Like he was nothing. He smashed into the wall with a thud and crumpled.

Gunshots, then. Lots of them. Bridger and his team fired on Keller and plenty of those rounds found their mark. But the banker kept coming. It was chaos on the screens. From Bridger’s point of view, I saw Keller push forward and swat at Gable, whose head snapped back sickeningly. My heart rose into my throat, and brought bile up with it. I was no operator, but I knew enough of the world to recognize a dead man when I saw one. Gable had fallen backward, flat on his back, neck distended, eyes wide and empty.

Bridger’s focus was back on Keller, but he and Salman were retreating through the doorway. Keller’s body shuddered and twitched as bullets connected, but he did not stop closing on the operators. Bridger was shouting something, I could not make it out. His voice was high, panicked. Smoke began pouring from Keller’s mouth as he followed them, circling his head like a wreath, then shrouding it. 

Bridger and Salman reached the stairs, and Clark and Gonzalez took positions at the bottom to cover their retreat. More gunfire. More chaos on the cameras. A flashbang lit the screens up and made me jump in my chair. All four men were firing on Keller, who was now descending the stairs, still seemingly unconcerned by the bullets tearing through his body.

Then the smoke around Keller’s head dissipated, and my whole world unravelled.

Since that night I’ve thought about what happened more than is probably healthy. But for me it was a watershed moment unlike anything else I’ve experienced in my life. See, a man has certain rules of reality that he lives by in order to make sense of things. The sun rises in the east. The sky is blue. Monsters aren’t real. We learn concepts like these as children, and we hold those truths deep within us once we’ve accepted them. If the sun rose in the west tomorrow, how could I make sense of that? How could anyone?

So, when I tell you that extreme confusion outweighed even my fear when Keller stepped through that smoke, no longer human, but a winged creature with the body of a man and the head of an owl, you’ll understand I’m telling the truth.

It had grown, was now towering over Bridger, and its massive eyes traced rapidly through the room. Its large white wings extended from its back, and they flexed as the beast stalked closer to the remaining members of the QRF.

I’m not sure what I was thinking, but without consciously deciding to stand I found myself out of my seat and checking that I had a round chambered in my sidearm. Wilson looked at me like I’d lost my mind.

“What are you doing?” He swallowed, hard. “You can’t leave. Where are you going?”

My eyes flitted back to the screen. “That thing is killing them, we’ve gotta get up there and help.”

Wilson stuttered incomprehensibly. It was clear he did not want to be alone in the van, and also equally clear he had no interest in storming Keller’s home. Hell, whatever that thing was, it was tearing apart a team of highly trained operators. What shot did *I* have? Looking back now, I’m amazed I found the stones. I’m no coward, but I damn sure like living. Whatever madness had overtaken me evidently gave me superhuman confidence or suicidal tendencies. I took one last look at Wilson, who’d gone white as a sheet, opened the back door of the van, and began sprinting toward the house.

I ran hard. I was into the trees and rushing the hill in no time, leaves and twigs crunching and cracking beneath my feet. Gunshots still sounded from the residence, but they’d lessened. There was silence for a spell as I reached the wall. I held my breath, listened. That silence was an ill omen. Maybe I was too late. Maybe it was already over.

Maybe everyone was dead.

I shook myself out of the creeping panic, pulled myself over the stone barricade. Somehow the quiet made things infinitely worse. Fear began to find me. All I could hear was my heart pounding in my ears. My shallow, ragged breathing. I held my pistol at the ready with trembling hands. *What the fuck am I doing?*

I took cautious steps toward the front of the house. At the busted front door I nudged the toe of my boot into the gap and took a step inside.

Everything was dark. I silently cursed myself for thinking this was a good idea and fumbled in my pocket for the small flashlight I carried as part of my everyday kit. I turned it on with shaky fingers and swept it around the room.

They were gone. All dead. I tasted bile in my throat and thought I might retch. Bridger was sprawled fifteen feet ahead of me, one arm torn from his body, intestines spilled out across the floor. Clark, to his left, looked like he’d been cleaved down the middle.

I took a step backward toward the door. Time to go. I’d come to help, but there was no one left to take advantage of it. I needed to run, and I needed to do it now.

Something shifted to my right, and I twisted with the flashlight just in time to see the beast’s head cock to the side, its huge owl eyes glowing like hellfire. It flew toward me, and before I could get a shot off I felt a crush against my ribs. I was off my feet, completely turned over. Then I was slamming into the wall by the stairs. A flash of intense white light flooded my vision as my head connected with something hard, and I felt pain ripple and twitch through my chest and back.

I was on the ground. I could taste blood in my mouth. Strange the things you think of in moments like that. Surrounded by my dead comrades, on the verge of unconsciousness myself, all I could think was: *Yes*, I had been right. Ivo Keller *was* the bad guy.",1,1738166012.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False
1icwxif,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDmeds/comments/1icwxif/impossible_trade_offs_with_metylphenidate/,Impossible trade offs with Metylphenidate,"I have been on MPH for nearly 2.5 years now, at first I used IR (instant release), but after a year and a half I found it to be too much of a roller coaster, due to the constant ups and downs, so I switched to MPH XR (Extended release), this helped me a lot with my sleep cycles and a more general balance, however I keep having physical tension and cannot seem to get any real relaxation on the meds. If I take breaks I end up in a vicious cycle of addiction and other impulsive behavior and spiral out of control real quick. 

I took a 24 day break recently and ended up doing all sorts of wrong addictive things, but the silly thing is, I was relaxed, had barely any anxiety and I felt great, up until the point where my addictions started making life miserable again and I also noticed I had severe mood swings. 

I rebooted my MPH and the mood swings vanished like snow in the sun, but the problem with anxiousness has returned so I am thinking about switching to lisdexamphetamine, but I am curious to other people's experience, because I read mixed things, some say that dex overstimulates them, others say the same for MPH, my worry is because, as far as I know, dex whould work more intensely on dopamine supply instead of reuptake, that this would actually give me more stimuli than MPH. I am sensitive to things like coffee and other stimulants, however when on meds I can actually drink more coffee than when I am off them. 

Another thing I am really curious about is my tolerance for dopamine related activities, when I am on MPH and I do something thrilling, something that gives me a dopamine boost, it really overstimulates me so much that it can push me into a big anxiety attack, it's like the dopamine from these activities (like a major sports event, or competitive gaming) stack the dopamine and because MPH is a reuptake inhibitor, it feels like it may become some sort of buffer overflow (Disclaimer: this is just a subjective pseudoscientific and personal interpretation).

I would love to hear from users experiences that have either gone through the same process and have experience with both and/or more meds. ",1,1738166012.0,ADHDmeds,0,1.0,False

I'm very interested in your perspective about expectations associated with meeting new people through this platform. Like many of us, I occasionally drift down the NSFW rabbit hole to find like-minded people. Recently, I posted a personals ad looking for a dating partner, with an emphasis on the more physical aspects of such relationships. I'm not a young man (40s), so casually dating isn't really my cup of tea. I want to be very clear that my posting was emphasized on longer term, vs one offs. The response from the community was your typical mixed bag of scammers to very articulate / thoughtful messages. I responded to someone who fell into the middle of that scale and had a couple days of conversation with her. She is age appropriate, educated, professionally employed, and we seemed to align well on many things. Yesterday was a work day, so I didn't hear from her very much which is expected. My last message to her was mid afternoon, let's say 3:30pm for reference. This morning, while having my coffee around 4am I was catching up and realized this person never responded. I decided to check her profile for activity (AITA?) to find that she was active around 11pm - Midnight and publicly commenting on cringe almost juvenile postings. A few responses seemed like she was fishing, someone from a local group asked if there were any real women on the sub or was it only bots and fraudsters. Which, whatever... But my favorite was her last activity:

Post Question: Who wants a good F@#$ing
Her response: Me. All the time. 

I try to not judge people, or yuck anyone's yum. But I must admit that I was put off that her fucus was to respond to such a gross posting. Maybe even a little offended that took precedence over responding to me. I deleted my correspondence with her and sent one final message ""I am going in a different direction, but good luck to you"" mostly because I don't subscribe to ghosting anyone (again, AITA?).

1icwt4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/uklaw/comments/1icwt4m/us_qualified_lawyer_looking_to_restart_in_private/,US Qualified Lawyer looking to “restart” in private equity/M&A,"Looking for any and all advice, including offers to grab coffee to let me hear about your career path or names of good recruiters, as it relates to making a “career change” within the field of law. 

A bit more context: I graduated from law school in the US in 2019 and immediately began working as a corporate and transactional attorney. My time was mainly spent working in the areas of private equity, capital markets (both debt and equity), cross-border M&A, pre-IPO and IPOs (including SPAC experience), venture capital (both company side and fund side) as 50% of my time, with the other 50% being spent as the lead associate for public and private company reporting and corporate governance for clients (ranging from large well known, household names, to dual-listed smaller reporting companies to start ups). 

As one does right before turning 30, I had a small existential crisis that  made me realize I was losing my chance to try and live in London. Unfortunately this coincided with a very difficult time in the market and so I took the first job I could find that would sponsor me. The firm allowed me to further expand my transactional practice in the field of investment management and fund work generally, but I could tell within the first month that this would not be a long term place for me. This idea was further solidified when I began networking in the legal market in London. 

The market here is heavily saturated, and I took the advice of some mentors to resign from my job and focus on studying for the SQE1, which I just took last week. 


As I’m sure you can see, I’ve had the privilege of dabbling in many areas of the law. One of the negatives is that I’ve never been able to make any of them my expertise, and I’ve realized that I’d like to essentially “restart” as an ~NQ with a law firm in London. 

Hoping to get advice on:
- whether NQ is the right target to be aiming for? I’ve talked to a few recruiters who all insisted to begin applying for jobs at PQE 3-5, but this seems contrary to what partners at certain law firms have told me. 
- any names of recruiters who informally talk to firms before putting forward candidates? Because my experience isn’t straightforward and I require sponsorship, cold applying doesn’t seem like the way to go. 
- any general advice about the private equity market in London or anyone that has transitioned from a PE solicitor into the business side of PE. In addition to studying the last few months, I’ve been taking financial modeling courses for fun, have been listening to podcasts on the business aspects of PE, and took FINRA’s securities industry essentials exam for fun, all of which has led me to believe that a transition to the business side of PE could be intriguing as well.

He was interviewing Rick Caruso and they're talking about the LA fires.

My mom walked through to make some coffee and she over heard the podcast.  She ended up sitting down and getting completely engrossed in the podcast.  At one point she even hunched forward to really pay attention like a gamer doing a hard boss.

My mom said 'I remember this guy, he used to be a famous journalist.'

I had to correct her and say 'no, thats Sam Harris a famous atheist.'

She was incredulous 'hes an atheist and hes talking about charity?'

She couldn't fathom that someone who doesn't believe in God can be charitable.  It was eye opening because it feels like to me she thinks atheists go around punching infants in their free time.

1icwp1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1icwp1q/black_decker_cm1160b1_coffee_maker_real_user/,Black Decker CM1160B-1 coffee maker real user review,"Using the Black+Decker CM1160B-1 12-Cup Digital Coffee Maker every morning has been an interesting mix of convenience and quirks. This sleek, black, stainless steel coffee maker stands out on my crowded kitchen counter, blending nicely with modern appliances. The minimalist matte finish and intuitive design give it a premium feel—though it’s not quite as robust as some pricier models. After a couple of months, I can confidently say it gets the job done, but let’s dig into the details.

Looking for the best price on BLACK+DECKER CM1160B-1? [See it on Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/blackdecker-cm1160b-1-coffee-maker-review-b01gjomwva/)

**Design & Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was how lightweight this machine is for a 12-cup coffee maker. While that’s great for moving it around (or cleaning underneath it), I wouldn’t say it screams durability. The Duralife glass carafe, sturdy enough for daily use, feels like it can handle the occasional slip. Its measurement markings are clear, and the easy-grip handle is a nice touch for those early mornings when my brain is still waking up. On the downside, the buttons, while responsive and rubberized, sometimes feel a bit cheap.

**Brewing Performance**  
What impressed me most is how fast it brews. On busy mornings, I’m barely out of the shower, and my coffee is ready. Consistency is another win here; I’ve never had a half-brewed pot or uneven coffee strength. However, the Sneak-A-Cup feature, which allows you to grab a quick pour mid-brew, does drip a little. It’s not a deal-breaker, but keep a paper towel handy.

**Coffee Flavor**  
I’ve brewed everything from light roasts to dark espresso blends, and the flavor comes out rich and smooth almost every time. The heat plate keeps the coffee warm for about two hours, which is perfect for my weekend routine. However, if you’re a slow sipper, you might find yourself with lukewarm coffee after the auto-shutoff kicks in. Adding a thermal carafe option would have been a game-changer.

**Cleaning & Maintenance**  
The washable brew basket is a lifesaver. I’ve always hated dealing with flimsy paper filters, so this reusable option is a big plus. The water reservoir is easy to fill, thanks to the front-facing window, and cleaning it periodically with vinegar has been straightforward. One issue I’ve noticed is that the carafe lid doesn’t detach, making thorough cleaning a bit tricky.

**Pros**

* Quick brewing time ensures fresh coffee faster.
* Sleek design with a lightweight build fits well in small kitchens.
* Washable basket filter eliminates the need for paper filters.
* User-friendly QuickTouch programming for setting brew times.

**Cons**

* Drips slightly when using Sneak-A-Cup feature.
* Auto-shutoff at 2 hours might annoy those who like coffee to stay hot longer.
* The carafe lid is not removable, complicating cleanup.
* Build quality could feel sturdier for long-term use.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Compared to similar models, like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker, the Black+Decker CM1160B-1 is faster and has a more intuitive design. However, Mr. Coffee edges ahead with a thermal carafe option, which keeps coffee hot for longer. On the flip side, Keurig single-serve machines might appeal to people who don’t need a full pot. Still, if you’re brewing for multiple coffee drinkers, the Black+Decker offers better value for its capacity.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
This coffee maker sits in the sweet spot between affordability and functionality. While it doesn’t have high-end features like temperature control or a thermal carafe, its price makes it an excellent choice for budget-conscious buyers. You’re getting solid performance and a few handy features like Sneak-A-Cup and programmable brewing, making it a worthwhile investment for most households.

**Features in Action**  
The programmable QuickTouch controls are straightforward—you can set the 24-hour auto-brew feature in under a minute. The digital display, while basic, is clear and easy to read. Another feature I loved is the easy-view water window, which eliminates guesswork when filling the reservoir. However, the nonstick Keep Hot carafe plate could use an upgrade, as it sometimes feels like it cools too quickly.

Daily use has shown me this machine is perfect for those who prioritize simplicity and speed over fancy bells and whistles. My teenager, who’s just started drinking coffee (don’t judge), loves the simplicity of pressing a button and having coffee ready in minutes.

1icwoey,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscifistories/comments/1icwoey/say_hello_to_milton/,Say Hello to Mil-TON!,"Jenny Watt was hunched over the control monitors working intently under the soft hum of the ship’s idle engines until the bridge doors shot open with a clatter of boots and metal. Elijah Brookes swept in with a wide grin across his face and a new android companion following closely behind. 

“Hey-hey!” he announced. “Say hello to crew member number three! Or should I say 3.0?”

After a performative delay, Jenny swivelled away from her monitor, her eyes staying glued to the screen for a moment longer before peeling them away reluctantly. She looked at the two standing side by side in front of her. She was having doubts about this trip. 

“You got it working. Well done.” Jenny responded dryly. 

“I sure did!” beamed Elijah. “Say hello to ‘Mil-TON’ short for Military Tactical and Observational Non-Combative assistant.” Elijah gestured proudly to a rather unimposing looking android that stood by meekly. “He’s just been booted up. I’ll leave you two to get acquainted.”

 Elijah winked at Jenny and elbowed Mil-TON who readjusted his balance with a whirr of stabilising motors. Elijah then left towards the door while rubbing his elbow. Mil-TON stood not even five feet tall and on digitigrade legs. He was made of a mostly bare, exposed carbon fibre frame. On the top half were slender, hunched shoulders and a stooped head with two strips of display panels – one for a ‘mouth’ and the other for ‘eyes’. Jenny looked it up and down, unimpressed. 

“He looks and sounds like a little butler.” she shouted over it, towards Elijah on his way out.

“Oh don't be like that. Mil-TON, say hello to your crewmate!” Elijah responded as the door closed behind him.

Mil-TON stepped towards Jenny and she pulled back in her chair instinctively. 

""Hello there!"" he said enthusiastically with a speedy, matter of factly tone while reaching out a narrow 4 digit hand. Surprisingly frail looking for a military-grade piece of equipment Jenny thought. 

""Hi–"" Jenny reluctantly gave up a limp handshake to a cold, carbon fibre grasp.

“And your name is?”

“Jenny.”

""Ah, Jenny what?"" he asked inquisitively with a tilt to his head and a friendly smile appeared on his pixelated lower display panel.

""Yes, Jenny Watt."" Jenny replied and looked on with a bewildered frown. ""...How did you know that?""

Mil-TON paused, seemingly calculating. 

""What?"" he replied, eventually.

“How-did-you-know-that?” Jenny enunciated impatiently.

“Know what?” asked Mil-TON, his face panels now with an inquisitive expression. 

“How did you know that Watt was my last name!”

Mil-TON began to chuckle. His head bobbed up and down smoothly on hydraulics and his eye panels turned to horizontal half moons.

“Now I see our misunderstanding. I was asking you what your last name was: ‘Jenny what?’ W-H-A-T. Your last name is Watt, presumably spelt W-A-T-T. Is that correct?

Jenny looked back at Mil-TON unamused.

""Ugh!"" Jenny fell back into her chair and swivelled back to the control panel. 

""We really have to travel with this thing for three months.."" she muttered beneath her breath while jabbing a finger at the monitor.

""Four months!"" Mil-TON interjected, causing Jenny to jump. ""We will need to reduce our speed considerably when traversing through the Orion nebula.""

""Great. Thank you, Mil-TON""

A few moments passed as Mil-TON hovered behind Jenny as she continued back at her monitors to calibrate the systems for launch. 

""Can I assist you with anything?"" he asked eventually. Mil-TON’s default stance seemed to be with his hands raised in front as if waiting to intervene or catch something.

""No. Just let me work.""

""Very well."" Mil-TON’s posture eased slightly and his core drive seemed to shift down a gear into a quieter albeit higher pitched rev.

Mil-TON continued to hover behind Jenny, watching her monitors attentively. She worked away, though feeling him behind her, her jaw became clenched and she was unable to tune out that annoyingly faint high pitched rev of Mil-TON’s high efficiency core drive. Eventually Jenny stopped punching commands into the monitor and unclenched her jaw. She took a deep inhale then allowed her shoulders to relax down from her ears and closed her eyes. 

""–Oh, and Jen?"" blurted Mil-TON, a step closer behind her.

Jenny's eyes remained closed, her face illuminated by blue light from the monitors. She inhaled deeply. 

""It’s Jenny,” she sighed.  “And what is it?""

""I would not set life-support systems as you have just done. Although I can confirm I use significantly less resources than a human, I will require both freshwater and oxygen to purge, run my systems and perform essential self-maintenance.""

Jenny did not respond, but jabbed her fingers at the display and undid her configuration without dignifying it by directly looking.

""You know what? Here!"" she said, as she shot up from her chair leaving it spinning behind her. ""You can do the launch protocols.” She marched towards the exit, hitting the door release panel sending the doors shooting open. 

""Jenny, I'm sor–""

""It's fine, Just do it. I need some rest. And besides, you clearly have all the answers.""

""Jenny.""

""WHAT?!""

“Sorry, Jenny Watt”

Jenny began to massage the bridge of her nose. “No, what is it?”

""Oh! Well I’m sorry but I am not authorised to carry out system launch protocols myself. I can merely observe and provide assisted guidance to the primary user.""

Jenny dropped her head, defeated and thumped the panel so the bridge doors slid back closed. She slinked back to her chair as Mil-TON tracked her movements until she fell back into her seat. 

""Ok,” she sighed. “Ok, in that case, get me a fucking coffee please, then pull up a chair to assist me properly – if you are authorised to sit down? Your constant loitering is making me anxious.""

Mil-TON posture lifted and a smile appeared. 

“I can do that, no problem,” He marched on the spot to turn around then walked off to get Jenny her coffee before he stopped abruptly. 

“Jenny,”

Ideally, I’d love to live with women around the age of 30 who value emotional maturity and maintaining a clean, quiet, and respectful home environment. Good communication is essential, as I want our space to feel safe and welcoming for all of us! 

Additionally if this apartment does not workout I can get discounts on other apartments! I don't need to find a place until April 10th at the latest. But I would love to lock this one down if possible.

**A little about me:**  
I’m clean, quiet, and organized, with an eclectic minimalist style. I rarely have guests over, but when I do, it’s usually for a casual catch-up over a glass of wine. I enjoy cooking simple meals—mainly rice and fish—but I don’t have any dietary restrictions. I work as a leasing consultant in Manhattan from 9 AM to 6 PM.

I also have two cats: Kimchi, an 8-year-old calico who enjoys attention on her own terms and doesn’t like being picked up but loves to snuggle next to you. Kat, a 14-year-old tabby who loves being held and is very affectionate.

If this sounds like a good fit for you, please reach out! I'd love to grab coffee or brunch to see if we click.

It’s the simple practice of pairing new habits with something you already do. Think of it as a way to reinforce good behavior while integrating healthy routines into your daily life.

**Why It’s Important when you are taking GLP-1?**  
**1.) Consistent Weight Loss:** Pair healthy eating or exercise with your GLP-1 regimen to maximize results.  
**2.)** **Increased Motivation**: Connecting new habits to existing ones makes them easier to stick with.  
**3.) Improved Health:** Small changes add up, helping you make lasting, positive changes.

**How to Stack Your Habits?**

* After I drink my morning coffee, I’ll take my GLP-1 injection.
* When I eat lunch, I’ll take a walk for 10 minutes.
* After dinner, I’ll prepare tomorrow’s healthy snack.

My tech skills (SQL, Excel, Power BI...) are not an issue. However, my soft skills such as storytelling and writing narratives, communicating my ideas, active listening, managing business partners, prioritizing, problem-solving skills, even socializing on relaxed team dinners/drinks (which are important as well), have a good visibility, being responsive are something where I feel that I am not good enough. 

I just feel like, based on my internships, I made wrong actions in these situations. So, to tackle this, I am thinking to create and learn tailored ""frameworks"" using different online resources (incl. this subreddit) and Chat GPT to simplify it. For example - HEFE framework (which actually exists) that can be used for small talks in the first 5min of meeting to warmup or on team dinners. I would have similar for prioritizing, problem solving skills, presenting the variance analysis results to CFO or business partners, etc. What do you think about this? Also, I will have regular 1:1s coffee chats with my manager and after I receive feedback and identify new weakness, I will again write down to tackle it with tailored made action framework. 

TLDR: Starting my first FP&A role at a FAANG company. Strong on tech skills, but need to improve soft skills (storytelling, communication, socializing, etc.). Planning to create tailored ""frameworks"" for different situations (e.g., small talk, prioritizing, presenting results) and refine them based on feedback from 1:1s.

Unfortunately yesterday was different. I've been having pain in a top right tooth about mid-way back. They did an X-Ray and only saw that the nerve was calcified. The dentist says it's highly likely a cracked root based on the symptoms and I trust her but getting it fixed is about $1,500 after insurance covers the first $1,500 so I hope no one minds reviewing the symptoms and giving me confirmation and if possible.......symptomatic treatment ideas until my appointment to get it fixed in about 2 months. (removal and bridge is the treatment).

Symptoms: 

Sensitive to pressure from the bottom only, (touching or pushing on the sides has no sensitivity). Pain is about a 2/10 when chewing soooo not too awful.

Doesn't HURT when exposed to cold or hot BUT that is what causes the pain to start. I intermittent fast from 2pm to 8am and the sensitivity to touch grows less and less the longer I go without eating or drinking. When I wake up in the morning I can literally push upwards on the tooth with full force and it feels 100% pain-free and normal. When I take a drink of iced coffee and eat breakfast the sensitivity slowly returns (not a sudden thing but over 10-15 minutes).

No persistent or constant pain at all until it is pushed on or touched.

  
I use normal toothpaste, brush once a day and floss with a flosser numerous times a day (mostly as an oral fixation).

It's like I want to treat myself to an hour of sitting and enjoying my coffee in the morning because it's peaceful but then I end up waiting too long to get ready and flopping. And before you say ""can you just wake up at 5?"" or something, no, me and my partner wake up at 4:30 together and it's one of the nicest times we get to spend together in the day drinking our coffee and being silly and watching the BBC, the evening alway feels so tired and like it only exists to prepare for the next day, lol.

I no longer replace his toothbrush- he’s had the same one for over six months and it’s missing bristles.  There are new ones in the cabinet.

There are plates and coffee cups all over the coffee table.

There are empty packets by the stove.

He made porridge and just left the leftover in the pot on the stove.  Just left it.  It’s been there for two days.

He couldn’t clean up the puppy pee, because he ‘didn’t know’ where the floor cleaner was kept.

I HATE having shit everywhere.  But I have to fight my instinct to pick it all up.  I’m not his fucking maid.

That’s the stuff I don’t do.

Some things I can’t avoid - he’s been constipated and taking laxatives - oh look, liquid 💩 stain on the sheets.  I CANNOT live with that.  Surely he fucking KNOWS that it’s there??!?  It comes out of HIM.

It had gotten to the point where he would stand in the living room, look at me and ask if he had any clean boxers - and would wait for me to go and fetch them.  Or stand IN FRONT of the fridge/panty, not open them, and call me in from the other room and ask me what we had to eat.

I still wash his clothes and put them away.  Because I have to line up my ducks and leave this marriage with the best outcome for me.

But I am so fucking sick of having to step over a pile of shitty underwear five times a day.   I’m sick of having to scrub the toilet daily, because he’s thing laxatives and leaving ‘splash marks’ all over the toilet.

1icwa8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/OveractiveBladder/comments/1icwa8r/shall_i_change_my_hospital/,Shall i change my hospital?,"I was diagnosed with Overactive Bladder (OAB) a couple of months ago after experiencing symptoms for over a year, which I initially thought were minor issues. After visiting several hospitals, I was only tested for urinary tract infections (UTIs) and prescribed medications, but my condition did not improve. Even after treating the UTI, I continued to suffer from an excessive urge to urinate and a burning sensation after urination. I can only drink water; anything else irritates my bladder and triggers the urge to urinate again. The worst triggers for me are soft drinks, unsweetened teas, and coffee; oddly enough, alcohol does not trigger any symptoms.  
  
After this frustrating experience, I decided to go to a hospital that specializes in urology. My doctor prescribed solifenacin and other medications, which helped me control my urges significantly. I no longer felt confused or irritable from the constant need to urinate, and my sleep improved as the burning sensation diminished. However, when I stopped taking the medication, my symptoms returned. During my next appointment, I asked my doctor whether OAB can be cured. Although I suspected the answer, he told me it could be cured, which left me confused since I understood that OAB is a chronic condition that can only be managed through treatment. I began to question his honesty—perhaps he wanted to avoid worrying me—but his medications worked effectively, and now I'm uncertain whether I can trust him anymore.",1,1738164356.0,OveractiveBladder,1,1.0,False

I feel like I’m missing that—flowers for no reason, coffee to lift my mood, and so on. We’ve talked about this several times, but nothing has changed. This time, I told him that this would be the last time I bring up this topic with him. He replied, “Now I understand what you’ve been missing. Everything will be fine. Give me some time.” I said okay.

But there was one moment that I didn’t like. When I started bringing up this topic, he asked me, “And what about me? Have you thought about me?” Since we are currently in a long-distance relationship, he added, “Have you thought about sending me something?”

After these questions, I felt uneasy. I couldn’t believe he would ask something like that. I do everything I can—I’ve given him gifts, shown attention, always supported him, and always ask how he’s doing.

I have been taking Nakpro products since a while (although this is the first time I ordered from their website) and they usually have a verification sticker on the product where you can send the printed code to the designated number and Nakpro replies within a few seconds that the product is verified.

The issue started when I sent in the codes on the whey protein packets. I've received no text till now claiming that the product is original Nakpro product. I did scan the QR code on the product which just confirms with the website that the invoice I received with the delivery is valid.

My suspicion arose because the original whey protein packets have a typical flavour logo + name in the bottom right corner of the packet while all 3 whey protein packets I received have no such logo.

1icw66l,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1icw66l/something_was_watching_us/,Something was watching us,"The story of what happened began in 2009, a year my family would never forget. Back then, we were a large family. My grandmother, with her seven children, had built a rapidly growing dynasty. Each of her children had at least two kids, except for my aunt, who never had children, and my mother, who only had me. In total, we were eleven grandchildren. Every year, during the holidays, it was our tradition to gather and travel as a family. But the year 2009 would be different.

My uncle Alejandro, a man with an adventurous spirit, had bought a farm in a rural area with a warm and temperate climate. The farm seemed like something out of a dream: a white house on top of a small hill, with two floors and balconies in every room, from which you could see the entire valley. At the bottom of the hill, there was a large parking area, and a little further away, a big, lonely one-story house hidden among trees. The landscape was so beautiful that sometimes we felt as if we were in another world, one where time stood still.

But what impressed me the most were the sounds. The whisper of the wind through the trees, the singing of geese and ducks in the small lake, the distant neighing of the horses. It was a place that, although seemingly perfect, had something in its stillness that I couldn’t quite understand. Something I couldn’t name, just like when a child feels fear but can’t explain why—it’s just… instinct.

My uncle Alejandro invited us to spend a few days at the farm. We were all excited. My cousins and I played and laughed nonstop. We swam in the pool, explored every corner of the property, and the fresh morning air was the perfect refuge for our endless games. Everything seemed idyllic, almost unreal.
But after those days of fun, we had to return to the city. The children had to go back to school, and the adults to their jobs. My uncle, due to his commitments, couldn’t be there all the time, so he decided to hire someone to take care of the farm and the animals in his absence. Mr. Ramón, a sturdy man with a deep voice, arrived with his wife—a woman with an expressionless face—and their two children, Esteban and Sara. Esteban, a boy of about nine or ten years old, had a sad look in his eyes, as if childhood laughter had slipped away from him too quickly. Sara, his sister, was a mystery. Though she was about our age, her behavior was more like that of someone much older—quiet, distant, lost in thoughts we couldn’t understand.

Mr. Ramón’s family stayed at the farm whenever my uncle wasn’t there. But when we or other guests arrived, they moved to a set of rooms my uncle had built especially for them, a place separate from the main house. Even so, we shared the kitchen and the rest of the farm, and although it was sometimes difficult to ignore the fleeting glances or the awkward silence of Mr. Ramón’s wife, the adults acted kindly, as if everything was fine.

For us children, it seemed like the perfect situation—so much freedom, so much space to play and explore. During that year’s holiday season, when the whole family gathered at the farm again, we ran excitedly toward the pool, laughing and chatting. We invited Mr. Ramón’s children to join us, but their response was less enthusiastic than we expected. Esteban was shy, but his eyes sparkled with the curiosity of someone who wanted to belong but couldn’t. Sara, on the other hand… she always seemed miles away, as if her body was at the farm, but her mind was elsewhere, in another time. Most of the day, we saw her sitting alone in a quiet corner or staring at the horizon.

What unsettled me the most was the relationship between Sara and her mother. The woman was always cold and distant with us children. Never a smile, never an invitation to play. Her attitude was entirely different when she interacted with the adults—then she became a charming, warm woman who made everyone laugh. But in the presence of children, her face would turn blank, as if she didn’t know how to interact with us. It wasn’t just my imagination; my mother and my aunts noticed it too, though they never spoke about it openly.

Night came quickly, as it often does in remote places, where the sun sets without a trace. We were exhausted, gathering in our rooms to sleep, while the adults stayed outside on the terrace, surrounded by the murmurs of the night. They laughed, shared cold beers and snacks, but something in the air, something in the stillness of the farm, made me uneasy. I, gripped by an inexplicable curiosity, got out of bed without knowing exactly why. I just felt an urgent need to get closer, to hear more. Maybe I wanted to ask my mother for something, but as I approached the balcony, something in the air made me stop. Instead of stepping forward, I stayed hidden in the shadows, unnoticed.

That was when I heard the conversation. Mr. Ramón, with his deep voice, was talking to my uncle Alejandro and the other adults. Something in his words made my skin crawl. Apparently, before our arrival, the farm had been rented out to a parish or a center that organized spiritual retreats. During one of these retreats, a group of nuns and young novices—women preparing to enter the convent—had arrived, hoping to find peace and tranquility in that remote setting. But things hadn’t gone as expected.

Mr. Ramón recounted that the nuns hadn’t even spent a single night at the farm. Just hours after arriving, they began packing their belongings in a hurry, their desperation palpable. They rushed to the entrance and, between nervous whispers and hurried prayers, demanded to leave immediately. Mr. Ramón, surprised, tried to stop them. He explained that the road to town was long and that he couldn’t drive them, as his truck wasn’t available at the time. But the women, visibly terrified, refused to stay another minute in that place. They called someone, though Mr. Ramón never knew who. The only thing he remembered was that, after hours of waiting, a young man arrived in a truck—the kind used to transport crops or livestock.

The nuns climbed into the vehicle as if the ground beneath them was burning, afraid to touch any part of that land. At that moment, the mother superior approached Mr. Ramón and, before getting into the truck, told him something that left him paralyzed:

“Leave this place. Your family is being watched.”

The weight of those words left Mr. Ramón speechless. He had never noticed anything strange in his family, though his eyes had been clouded by the routine of tending the farm, and no one in the family had mentioned anything unusual. But that warning from the mother superior kept echoing in his mind—something didn’t add up. And later, when our family arrived, things began happening that he could no longer ignore.

My mother and my uncle’s wife, Estrella, had noticed something strange about Mrs. Ramón’s behavior and her daughter, Sara. The way she looked at us children—that coldness, that detachment—and how Sara always seemed absent, as if she lived in another world. It made them uneasy, and they decided to speak to Mr. Ramón, to share their concerns. That was when he started to remember, to connect the dots, and realized that something deeper, something darker, was happening at the farm, something hidden until that moment.

Then, I heard Mr. Ramón ask the adults about some crosses. Crosses? What crosses? His face was tense with worry. He described finding crosses in different parts of the farm—some buried, others partially visible, as if they had been deliberately hidden. In places we had never noticed before: near the fountain, between the two houses, behind the hilltop house, among the trees, by the geese’s lake, near the horse stable, even by the main entrance.

Who had put them there? And why?
A heavy silence settled over the night, as if something unseen was lurking in the shadows. Then, in a low, almost whispering voice, Mr. Ramón asked my uncle Alejandro:

“Has anyone else been here when we weren’t? Has someone entered without us knowing?”

My uncle, with a furrowed brow, shook his head, but there was a spark of doubt in his eyes. He didn’t know how to respond because he, too, had noticed something strange. It wasn’t just the presence of the crosses but something in the air—something intangible and invisible, yet everyone could feel it.

It was my mother who finally broke the silence, looking at Mr. Ramón with a serious, almost sorrowful expression.

“That’s not normal. We haven’t placed crosses on the farm, and we hadn’t seen them before. And now, suddenly, they appear. What’s going on here?”

But there were no answers. No one knew what to think. We only knew that something was out of place—something we couldn’t comprehend.
The next day, I was no longer myself. I couldn’t behave normally after that conversation. My eyes wandered everywhere; I needed to confirm the presence of the crosses. I managed to find the ones in the garden, the one among the trees near the lake, and the one behind the main house. They were very rudimentary crosses, made of branches with a very dark hue, almost ebony, tied together with twine or some type of rope. I couldn’t bring myself to approach them—something told me I shouldn’t touch them. But at least now I knew they were real.

That same night, the air was thick and heavy, as if the darkness itself were breathing over us. Outside, the adults continued searching with their flashlights for something no one could see—whispers and uneasy glances as they tried to decipher the source of a noise that had broken the night’s silence on the farm. I watched from the half-open door, my heart pounding in my chest. That’s when I saw her.

Sara.

She passed in front of us without making a sound, as if floating in the shadows. Her dark hair was tied in a braid. I could see that her gaze was fixed on a point beyond, a destination invisible to everyone except her. She walked with unsettling confidence—without hesitation, without even glancing at us.

“Why is she going to the lake?” my little cousin Andrés whispered, his voice trembling.

I didn’t know how to answer. It didn’t make sense. It was too late, the night was dense, the farm was immersed in almost complete darkness… and yet, Sara walked as if she knew every inch of the ground beneath her feet, as if something were guiding her.

My eyes instinctively turned to Mr. Ramón’s wife. She remained standing at the doorway, holding her flashlight unlit in her hands. She made no move to stop her daughter. She didn’t call out to her, didn’t try to follow her. She just stood there, motionless. And the most terrifying thing was her expression. There was no fear in her eyes, no concern… only resignation.

A chill ran down my spine.

My body urged me to act, to call her name, to run after her… but something—something I couldn’t explain—kept me anchored to the ground, as if interfering would be a mistake.

“I’m going to tell my mom,” I whispered, and without waiting for an answer, I ran upstairs.

My mother was lying down, but when I told her what I had seen, her expression changed immediately. She got up and said she would go tell Mr. Ramón. I clung to her arm as I followed her, but I never knew if she actually did.

The next morning, breakfast at the farm took place in tense silence. Amid the clinking of cutlery and the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, I heard something that made me shudder. Someone would come to take care of the crosses.

My uncle Alejandro said it with firm resolve, as if it were the only possible solution. His wife, Estrella, looked at him with reproach and concern. My mother and my aunt simply averted their gazes and continued eating, avoiding the topic. I, on the other hand, felt immense helplessness. It seemed like I was the only child who couldn’t ignore what was happening on the farm. My little cousins remained silent, avoiding any contact with Ramón’s family. And Sara… I never saw her again.

Her absence also unsettled my mother, who asked Ramón’s wife about her daughter. The woman responded with a kind, serene smile:

“She’s sick, but she’s recovering.”

As she spoke, she took my mother’s hands in hers with a tenderness that made no sense. She seemed so genuine, so empathetic… but when I looked closely, I knew she was lying. The truth wasn’t in her smile—it was in her eyes. You always have to look at people’s eyes; that’s where their real thoughts hide.

The next day, we left the farm and went to the town. We needed a distraction, to get away from that suffocating atmosphere. We walked through the plaza, visited the church, and bought some traditional pastries. For the first time in days, everything seemed fine. But when we returned, night had already fallen over the farm, and the first thing we noticed was the light on in the house on the plain.

“Ramón and his family left this morning for his parents’ house,” my uncle Alejandro said, frowning. “No one should be here.”

We stopped in front of the house, staring at that single illuminated window in the darkness.

“Ramón must have forgotten to turn off the light,” he tried to reassure us.

Without hesitation, he walked towards the house, determined to check that everything was in order. My aunt Carla, for some reason, took out her camera and snapped a picture of the scene. Minutes passed before my uncle returned.

“There’s nothing strange, just a light left on,” he said naturally, as if there was nothing to worry about.

But my aunt didn’t reply. She was staring at her camera screen, her expression turning to pure horror.

“Oh my God…” my mother whispered, covering her mouth with a hand.

I moved closer, trying to see what they were looking at. In the photo, in the lit window, there was a clear silhouette of a man—or something resembling a man. He was sitting sideways, his profile barely outlined by the light. But the most disturbing thing was his abdomen—it protruded unnaturally, swollen or deformed.
Silence fell over us. My uncle Alejandro checked the image and shook his head.

“There was no one there… I went in, I checked every room. There was no one.”

But the image didn’t lie. Fear took hold of the adults. They grabbed our hands and hurried us into the main house. That night, no one slept alone. They pulled mattresses onto the floor, brought blankets and pillows, and we all stayed in the same room, with the lights on and the adults keeping watch. No one mentioned the photo. No one spoke of the shadow in the window. And I don’t know why we simply didn’t leave that very night.

By morning, the decision had been made. They woke us before dawn, everything was packed and ready. We had a quick breakfast, and without looking back, we left the farm. The journey back to the city was long and silent. But once home, everything seemed to return to normal—or so we thought.

A few days later, my aunt Carla was reviewing the photos she had taken during the trip. She connected her camera to the TV to project them. Only she, my mother, and I were in the room, watching the screen. The first images were normal—us playing, exploring, laughing at the farm. But then, something changed.
Spots appeared in the photos.
Circles—some dark, others whitish, like shadows floating in the air. At first, we thought it was a camera glitch. But as we kept looking, the spots became clearer. If you stopped and looked closely… if you got close enough… you could see human features in them.

Eyes.
Mouths open in anguish.
Figures that hadn’t been there when the photos were taken.
My aunt Carla turned off the screen immediately.

A year later, my uncle put the farm up for sale. It wasn’t easy to sell. More than a year passed before someone showed interest. And during that time… more things happened. But that’s another story.
The truth is, we never found out what really happened.

What were those crosses?
What was that figure in the window?
And what were those dark and white spheres?

Folks, today we’re making HISTORIC changes to labor policy—changes so good, so beautifully efficient, you’ll wonder why we didn’t do this sooner. Workers have had it too easy for too long, and it’s time we fix that.

First up: Breaks. Oh, you love your little coffee breaks? Guess what—we’re getting rid of them! That’s right, no more wasting company time sipping lattes while hard-earned profits trickle down. You’ll be so busy winning at work you won’t even need a break! Productivity will skyrocket, and honestly, who needs rest when you have adrenaline and the American Dream?

Overtime? Ha! We’ve streamlined it right out of existence. Time-and-a-half? Sounds like a handout. You love capitalism, right? Well, in capitalism, if you wanted more money, you should’ve been born a CEO. It’s just common sense.

Safety Regulations? Here’s the deal: Real workers don’t need safety. What’s a few sparks, a little toxic exposure, or some missing fingers when you’ve got job security (and by security, we mean you’ll work until you drop—no need for a pesky retirement). Hard hats? Overrated. Railings? For the weak. And OSHA? Don’t worry about them, we took care of it.

Unions? Oh, GONE. We’re liberating you from the oppressive shackles of collective bargaining. You want a raise? Try bootstraps. You want healthcare? Have you tried not getting sick? Look, unions have been standing in the way of corporate freedom for too long, and that’s just sad. From now on, you’ll be free—truly free—to work long hours for less pay with no pesky worker protections getting in the way of corporate profits. A win-win!

So, get out there, tighten your tool belts, and get ready to make America work HARDER again. Because nothing says freedom like never being able to retire!

President Dirrell bit into a thin slice of toast, toasted to a crisp and layered with butter and jam. As he chewed, he accepted the report handed to him by one of his capable staff.

The president flipped through a few pages, including the cover, skimming the contents briefly before tossing it onto the table with a light thud.

“Mr. Clearon, according to this report, the Japanese Army managed to enter the other side of the Gate but has now walled off its surroundings, holing up like a turtle retreating into its shell. Is that correct?”

“Yes, sir. The Self-Defense Forces have fortified their defenses and remain stationary,” the aide responded, while casually corrected the President, saying it was the “Self-Defense Force,” not the “Army.”

Whether the president noticed the correction or not, he continued speaking.

“Hmm... Overwhelming technological superiority. Highly trained and skilled soldiers. What reason could they have to hesitate? What do you think about this?”

“Mr. President, allow me to explain. Japan has learned from the lessons of past wars. No matter how powerful their forces may be, attempting to occupy and control a vast region would stretch their resources thin. Their only viable option is to carefully assess the political landscape of the Special Region and adopt a strategy that focuses on key objectives.”

This strategy could also be inferred from the unusually high number of mid-level officers in the Special Region Task Force. Having secured the Gate, their current approach likely involves deploying small units across various parts of the Special Region for intelligence gathering and pacification efforts.

The president wiped butter from his lips with a napkin and cast a sharp glance at the advisor before him.

“In other words, you’re saying the Japanese military is assessing the situation in the Special Region?”

“Precisely, Mr. President. Prime Minister Hōjō is a cautious man. He’s not rushing for immediate results.”

The president took a sip of his coffee

Hōjō, having taken a strong stance in response to the Ginza Incident, had gained unprecedented approval ratings, stabilizing his administration. This allowed him the luxury of patience, avoiding any undue haste in delivering results.

In contrast, President Dirrell’s approval ratings were plummeting. He needed to deliver tangible results quickly to demonstrate progress to the public. That was the reality of his position.

“My good man, beyond the Gate is the new frontier.”

“Imagine the possibilities contained beyond the Gate.”

Untapped natural resources. Economic advantages from overwhelming differences in technology. Unpolluted lands. All the things a capitalist economy valued.

Resources exist—of that, there is no doubt. Analyzing the weapons of the soldiers who invaded Tokyo revealed mineral resources almost identical to those found on Earth. Moreover, there were indications that many metals and other mineral resources that were scarce on this side of the Gate were present in abundance in the Special Region.

As for the technological disparity, it could be inferred from the types and designs of their weapons. While adorned with craftsmanship so exquisite they resembled works of art, their weapons were still confined to the realm of handcrafting. The materials and structures were inconsistent, lacking any sense of standardization.

The tactics of knights clad in such equipment provided insight into the social structure and production capabilities of their society.

Furthermore, there were fantasy creatures, animals, and demi-humans that did not exist on this side. The genetic information these beings carried could be an untapped goldmine for researchers in the biotechnology industry.

And, of course, the ultimate marvel was the Gate itself. This supernatural phenomenon, along with everything it represented, had captivated the attention of scientists around the world.

“Rest assured, Mr. President. Our nation and Japan are allies. We share common values, and our economic ties are strong. The profits from the Gate will surely be made accessible to our corporations. Moreover, we must ensure that such opportunities are actively pursued.”

“That is not enough.”

Similar lobbying efforts were already underway by EU nations.

China, Russia, and emerging powers had also begun covert activities, aiming to claim the resources and benefits the Gate could bring.

“The real issue is how much of a share we can secure.”

This was the result that President Diller needed to present to the people.

“Shouldn’t our nation take a more proactive role in this? From the perspective of the U.S.-Japan alliance, I believe we could consider deploying the Army.”

However, the advisor shook his head regretfully.

“Our nation is already stretched thin dealing with the Middle East. We do not have the capacity to intervene in someone else’s conflict.”

Moreover, the potential of the Gate was not necessarily all positive. Attempting to tame and civilize the untamed barbarians on the other side would require a massive investment of budget and manpower over an extended period. This was no longer the colonial era, where resources could simply be plundered without concern.

The President sighed deeply, frustrated by the reality that things were not going as expected.

“Judging from the report, the battles beyond the Gate were extraordinarily intense, weren’t they?”

“The amount of ammunition expended was reportedly unprecedented. However, things have settled down recently. The Self-Defense Forces will hold their position. They are well-equipped and well-trained for defensive operations.”

“Hmm. Then what should our nation’s response be?”

“At this stage, it would be sufficient to support the Japanese government’s procurement of arms and ammunition. This only requires contacting the defense industry. Additionally, we should propose a joint academic investigation of the Special Region and push to send our people to the other side of the Gate. Beyond that, it would depend on how the situation unfolds.”

Overcommitting to Japan’s efforts risked entangling the United States in unforeseen complications. Events rarely unfold as expected. While most countries recognized Japan’s deployment of the Self-Defense Forces to the Special Region as justified, some — such as China and South Korea — condemned it as a resurgence of militarism and an act of aggression. These nations tended to criticize Japan no matter what, but such accusations still could not be entirely ignored. Should Japan appear to monopolize the benefits of the ‘Gate,’ other nations might align with this criticism, creating additional challenges. In such a scenario, the United States could be accused of being complicit, a situation that must be avoided at all costs.

“Let Japan pull its chestnuts out of the fire.”

“And if things get complicated, we can step in and put a stop to it,” the adviser explained calmly. “The United Nations had already been set up as a tool for such an eventuality.”

But Dirrell was still not satisfied.

So far, Japan had managed things skillfully, leaving little room for the U.S. to involve itself. However, Dirrell  was under pressure to deliver tangible results domestically. Ignoring the advisor’s concerns was not an option, but doing nothing also felt inadequate. The president clicked his tongue in irritation before nodding reluctantly and moving on to the next item on the agenda.

The appearance of the Gate was an event of historical significance, comparable to the discovery of the New World. Just as Spain’s discovery of the Americas catapulted it to a global empire, the Gate was expected to radically reshape the global order. Every government understood this, which is why the world’s attention remained fixed on Japan’s actions within the Special Region.",3,1738163816.0,gate,0,1.0,False
1icw2ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicInk/comments/1icw2ag/highly_effective_study_habits_without_being_tired/,Highly Effective Study Habits without being Tired,"The following mentioned are few effective study techniques that provides all the students with best ways to study for exams without being tired.

# 1. Convince yourself:

Start by convincing yourself that you can pull it off. You can do what you believe you are capable of doing. You need physical as well as mental strength to accomplish this. You need to prepare yourself mentally as early as the night before you are actually planning to study for long hours. This will build up your determination and you will think twice before giving up.

# 2. Be well rested:

Ever wondered why your mothers pestered you to sleep in the afternoons? Yes you got it. While you sleep, your body as well as your brain continuously generates new cells. If your body is well rested, you can effectively study smart way, as long as you want to. Therefore sleeping well the night before is crucial to your mental as well as physical stamina needed to study for long periods of time.

# 3. Eat light:

A large amount of energy in our body is wasted during digestion. Therefore in order to avoid feeling tired or groggy while studying, always eat foods which are easily digested. Consume carbohydrates and proteins. Avoid fried food, fats and sugars as much as possible. Don’t sip on cola or junk food from outside and drink plenty of water and fruit juices.

# 4. Exercise:

Exercise right before you sit to study or in between when you are taking a break. It will greatly boost up your energy levels and you will feel more alert and agile. Please avoid doing strenuous strength training like lifting heavy weights or high intensity cardio. Yoga, Pilates or a few minutes on the treadmill or brisk walk or skipping or half hour of swimming is recommended. This is one of the best way to study.

# 5. Identify your best time of study:

We all have those specific hours during which we are most energetic, most efficient and creative. Those are your peak hours. Try identifying them to get the maximum results out of your time. It is relatively easy for some to study all night whereas some may find it easy to study all day but may find it difficult to stay up past 12 am. All this depends on the individual’s study habits. Therefore identifying your peak hours is important study tip.

# 6. Caffeine is both good and bad:

You might think sipping on a lot of coffee will help you stay awake. Sadly this concept is wrong. Yes it does boost up your energy level but consuming too much will make you feel more drowsy than energetic. The sugar content here is the devil. If at all you want to consume coffee, make sure it is sugarless and the total intake should not be more than 2 to 3 mugs.

# 7. Improve your level of concentration:

Long hours are full of distractions. It is very easy for us to lose focus or get bored. Perform a simple exercise of concentration everyday to improve it. Light a candle in a dimly lit room. Sit up straight with your legs folded in the fashion of a yoga asana and stare at the candle flame as long as possible thinking about nothing. It is going to be very difficult initially but gradually your time and focus will increase and so will your level of concentration.

# 8. Cut off distractions:

You can never concentrate or even try increasing your levels of concentration if you keep objects of distractions all around you. Put away your laptop if you are not using it for studies. Switch off your mobile phone or silence it. You can obviously check for important calls or messages every time you take a break but not always. The motive is to keep away the constant beeping of a mobile or the urge to post on or check your social media profiles.

# 9. Take a short break:

The best way to keep your focus and go on for long hours is to take a 10 to 15 minutes break every 1 to 2 hours of study and a 30 minute break every 6 to 8 hours. The average span of attention for human beings is approximately an hour. Realize why we have 40 to 50 minutes periods at school? It is probably to ensure that what we learn stays with us longer.

# 10. Section it up and be organized:

Studying for long hours will be rendered useless if you do not manage to complete your portions and keep dragging with the same chapter. You can avoid this by sectioning it up and being a bit more organized. Read it first, then learn it, then write it down. Identify your mistakes. We tend to remember our mistakes so always make a list of your mistakes and work on those more.

# 11. Add variations:

Adding variations is very helpful especially when you are trying to study straight for several hours. It is one of the ways to avoid boredom. For example if you are preparing for different subjects say History, Geography and English, try learning history for 1 hour and then shift to geography or English. Similarly mix 2 chapters for 1 subject. This will break the monotony.

# 12. Writing is better than learning:

Writing is better if you are studying for long hours. Thinking for the answer will distract you making you feel you haven’t learnt properly when you actually have. Firstly while writing you can in no way fall asleep. You tend to be more alert. Secondly when you write, try to remember it then mentally recite as you write. Therefore written work is more accurate as it combines recalling, mental recitation and lastly writing.",1,1738163785.0,AcademicInk,0,1.0,False

1icvzgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/biggboss/comments/1icvzgf/vivian_dsena_an_icon_but_also_a_lesson/,Vivian Dsena: An Icon but also a Lesson,"I used to be childhood fan of VD, he has good acting skills and a CRAZY screen presence and I have argued for that against all on the Indian Televison sub also. Him as RK in Madhubala and Abhay in PKYEK were massive successes, take it from someone who saw it in those days. So when it was rumoured that he has signed the show I was a bit taken aback. My first comment here is ""if Vivian is really coming I will watch every episode because Hum Hain Deewaney Tere Deewaney"" so dare not anyone call be KV fanatic, I just am deeply inspired by KV's great resilience after watching the entire show and a bit disappointed in seeing what Vivian truly is.

**1.**  **Never understood why he did Biggboss :** He always mentioned it explicity how he will never do the show, laughed at it's mention so confidently in all interviews. He said that he is not the kind of the person who is cut for it. Which brings me to the next point.

**2.** **Privacy was synonymous with Vivian Dsena:** Since the beginning of his career, Vivian was blessed with a huge fan following even in the absence of social media. But he was a little cold to his fans, barely was connected to them on his socials and the situation got a bit out of hand after marrying Nouran who used to fight with his fan pages on Twitter. Then this sudden posting, allowing Nouran to be on television ( not being patriarchal , he got very angry when one picture of hers came out) blah blah does not make sense to me. What could be the reason on this 180 degrees of turn in his stance? And hence we come to the next point.

**3. Vivian also knew what he was bringing to the table and leveraged it:** Like me, a massive chunk of people started watching the season for him only and hence he signed this heavy contract with the channel- while voting cannot be manipulated, the whole making him the hero narrative, Laadla tag all that the channel did is certainly from his deal because no way this man came to top 2 brewing coffee. He knew in his heart that if he makes it in Top 2, there will be high chances of victory given his popularity. Unfortunately, he could not even justify the runner-up position.

**4. You should never 'meet' your heroes:** I am not a fan anymore, the only thing I associate with Vivian is vanity, arrogance, laziness, classism and misogyny. Perhaps as a kid I was smitten but as a grown person, those are not metrics for me to judge people, only a great jawline is of of no good. His onscreen roles were flawed heroes, larger than life but his real self did not match it. As also, how it is important to choose who you are getting into a relationship with, Nouran literally acts as an extension of Vivian, controlling his life.  they are not equals, it is like she is his teacher but anyways to each their own. This was my last season to watch and I learnt so much from it, especially from KV who also has his flaws and by no way do I pedestalize him but his discipline, consistency, good intentions, resilience and presence of mind inspired me so much.

**5. Final word:** Vivian could have either stuck to his extreme privacy stance which had worked for him so far, the mystery around him that you only saw him on screen added to his craft. Or he could not be over-confident, he thought he was too big for the show, too big to hustle, too big to appreciate and be aware of competition that only made me realise to keep moving in life. Hold the past glories in your heart but always aim for doing a notch higher than your laurels.

Quick context: had a rough start to solids, he has FPIES to eggs and around 7 months got so sick once (before we knew) he refused to try any foods for about 2 months. We are finally back to trying foods, he’s doing much better but still drinking mainly milk. Not sure if this is important but he’s 95% for height and weight, so he drinks a lot from my boobs 😂

Anywho I am unbelievably tired 27/30 days of a month. Not just like mom tired, like extremely fatigued I have to muscle through most of my days to watch him or get anything done. I drink electrolytes every morning and take a post natal maybe 1 every three days ( I forget so much 🫣).  Around my period it’s miserable. If I could I would sleep all day. If I have coffee I’ll feel on for an hour then go back to super duper tired.

Anyone else experience this? Even if I nap when he does, I might have energy for an hour then back to being so tired.

This is neglecting controversial books from controversial authors, like Jordan Peterson. I’m talking pretty unoffensive stuff like atomic habits or how to win friends and influence people.

**ORCS, GOBLINS, AND TROLLS - OH MY! Bookshops & Bonedust by Travis Baldree:** For anyone who needs to scratch their cozy fantasy itch, this book might do the trick. It’s lighthearted, queer, and escapist. The reading experience is like a warm hug. It won’t blow your mind, and it’s a little silly that Viv’s main form of character development is that she learns to like reading, but it’s cute. The stakes are perhaps a little higher than in *Legends & Lattes*, and the focus is disappointingly not always on the details of keeping a bookstore open, though it is nice to see how Viv might one day become the sort of character who would be interested in opening a coffee shop. 3/5⭐⭐⭐ Also counts for: alliterative title, prologues and epilogues, set in a small town

**SPACE OPERA The Stardust Grail by Yume Kitasei:** The alien worldbuilding is decent, and the heist plot in space is entertaining, but the main character falls flat. She’s supposed to be edgy and sarcastic, but the humor gets grating. The narrative attempts to make her sympathetic (through backstory and character relationships), but most of it comes too little and too late. Part of the problem might be that a lot of information about her is delivered in the form of dreamlike prophecy sequences that are too hectic to engender curiosity. Paying attention is a chore. After a while, it’s hard to find the motivation to puzzle together who she is on a deeper level. By the time her backstory is explained in straightforward terms, it’s too late to care. She never becomes as interesting as she needs to be to hold the book together. She just comes across as whiny. 2/5⭐⭐ Also counts for: criminals (hm), dreams, published in 2024, author of color, reference materials (hm)

**AUTHOR OF COLOR I Feed Her to the Beast and the Beast Is Me by Jamison Shea:** The pacing is a little off, and the prose—though stunning—can start to feel overwrought, but the lush atmosphere absolutely makes up for basically every flaw. It’s visceral, haunting, authentic, raw, unflinching, and dark. The main character is also so incredibly compelling. She’s an elite dancer who deserves everything she fights for, but she also technically cheats to get it (even though things like nepotism and classicism mean everyone else is also kind of cheating, just in a way that isn’t considered wrong). This tension allows the book to explore feminine rage, Faustian bargains, and villain origin stories in a super powerful and poignant way. It also dives into issues around race, beauty, perfection, and art. For a young adult book, it doesn’t shy away from tough topics. 4/5⭐⭐⭐⭐ Also counts for: first in a series, alliterative title, under the surface, prologues and epilogues, eldritch creatures (hm)

**SURVIVAL Diavola by Jennifer Marie Thorne:** In a rented Italian mansion that’s definitely haunted, a chaotic and toxic family has a reunion. With all of the complex family dynamics going on, thoughts and feelings are being suppressed and unacknowledged, and no one successfully manages to point out (or even always notice) that something sinister and dangerous is going on. It’s not scary at all, but it gets entertaining. The humor is okay if you’re willing to laugh at the privileged antics of American tourists who need to get their butts into therapy, though I’m not fully convinced that the book is quite as self-aware as it thinks it is. There’s also very little connecting the mysterious supernatural threat to anything else in the story. The result is that the final resolution feels like the ending to a completely different book. 3/5⭐⭐⭐ Also counts for: dreams, published in 2024

**JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER The Last Tale of the Flower Bride by Roshani Chokshi:** Fairytale meats gothic fiction in Chockshi’s *The Last Tale of the Flower Bride*. It goes for the vibes, and it finds them. The whole point of the book seems to be to capture the gothic aesthetic, and it uses just about every technique to do so: toxic relationships, creepy mansions, dual timelines, dreamlike settings, family secrets, amoral protagonists, social criticism, big reveals, strange marriage arrangements, and signs of madness. There’s decay everywhere—physical, moral, and psychological—to emphasize how the past is haunting the present.

You were walking your small dog north on Monitor St towards Driggs/ the park this morning around 9:15am when you collided with a man who was walking the opposite direction towards the BQE. You yelped in surprise/pain, it looked like you might have hurt your finger. He had medium-dark skin, was wearing blue work pants with black shoes, jacket, and baseball cap.

At first I was confused what happened and shrugged it off (hadn't had my coffee yet); but I was walking the same direction as him - as I got close he began deliberately obstructing my path and began ranting about my dog, me, and dogs in general... basically trying to start shit with me; so I suspect he was trying to start shit with you. The only difference was you're a woman with a small dog and I'm a man with a bigger dog, so he kept it verbal with me.

[**My (43M) daughter (21F) won't speak to me, I want her back in my life**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/11r1m16/my_43m_daughter_21f_wont_speak_to_me_i_want_her/) - Mar 14, 2023

This is my first time posting on reddit. I know I will be met with harsh judgement but I need advice on how to rebuild a relationship with my only daughter.

I want to start off by saying that I know I was the one who ruined our relationship but it's been three years already. I just don't see why she can't come around. I miss her terribly and she's my one and only girl, my only child.

I should explain, I (43M) married my current wife (21F) three years ago, it had caused quite some backlash from my friends, my community, some of my family members, my ex and of course, my daughter. But I had to marry my wife, she's the only one for me, she's beautiful, she's intelligent, she's a kind and caring woman. I knew my daughter would have some problems with my marriage but I never expected how harsh she could have been. She begged me to end this marriage, she pleaded with my WIFE to leave me. I had to admit, I'm not proud of myself but I told her that I wished she was never born, that I resented her and that she meant nothing to me. I already had a rocky relationship with my daughter, she never approved of my relationship with my wife but we would at least have a talking relationship. Since that day she hasn't spoken to me since.

If I am being honest, I miss her and I decided to see on social media, how she was doing. She's engaged. I am her father, and I found out about my own daughter's engagement through social media. That was when I knew I had made a serious mistake. I don't want to miss out on anymore of her milestones in life, I contacted her through social media but she had blocked me. I want to reach out to her again. I want her back in my life but I need advice.  


Edit:  
 I will be editing this post to answer some questions and paint a clearer picture. For one, I did not meet my wife when she was a minor, that would have been extremely disgusting and I would seen her differently if I had. Everything about our relationship had been legal and there was clear consent. I met her when she was 18, we dated for a total of 8 months before we had gotten married. She had always been more reserved and shy so we agreed on an elopement. I am not planning to have any more children in the near future. As for the relationship between my wife and my daughter, they weren't enemies, they were simply friends, she had started coming over and a relationship between us naturally developed. She was skeptical at very beginning but I truly love her and I know she feels the same.

I must also say, my wife is an adult woman, she is not some baby. The way that a lot of you consider her to be a child is frankly disturbing and hurtful towards her. She can make her own decisions and she chose to be with me, why else has she stayed by my side for three years?

&nbsp;

[**UPDATE: I (43M) met my daughter (21F) again after 3 years of no contact, it went badly**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12bge3q/update_i_43m_met_my_daughter_21f_again_after_3/) - April 4, 2023

I expected a lot of backlash when I had posted my first post regarding my issues with my daughter, but I hadn’t expected the death threats and the accusations that I am a ‘pedophile.’ I met my wife when she was 18 and an adult, that is that and just know I am unbothered by the death threats, it just shows how immature some people can be. Now, I did end up meeting with my daughter and I suppose I’m just posting this to get this all off my chest. 

I received a message from my daughter, she had unblocked me and sent me a brief message. She wanted to meet up and I was feeling hopeful, I thought maybe she realized that she needs her father in her life. Though, she followed it up by saying that my parents had pressured her into at least trying to speak with me. That hurt a bit, I thought she wanted to meet up and reconcile out of her own volition, but even if it was just pressure from my parents, I was still happy. This was my chance to make things right. 

On the day when we were supposed to meet up, I made a huge mistake, I lost track of time. I was busy with my wife, she was too cute to ignore and well, one thing led to another and by the time I remembered it was already 30 minutes after we were due to meet at the local park. I can’t forget the look my daughter gave me, she almost seemed as though she didn’t care and even expected this. I tried to explain myself the best way I could, I kept it vague and said I lost track of time but she wasn’t having any of it. I tried so hard to get through to her and explain that I was sorry but she just coldly told me to make my parents leave her alone. She told me that I wasn’t her father anymore, that she'd never forgive me for everything I did. She told me that if I or my parents ever bother her again she would stop talking to my side of the family completely. I had to admit, I was getting a little angry as my parents had done nothing wrong but I held my tongue. To add salt to the wound, she told me I wasn’t invited to her wedding and her maternal uncle would be walking her down the aisle instead. 

I felt broken, I wanted to make things work, I had to make things right, I kept trying to get through to her but her fiance showed up and they left, just like that. I couldn’t even get another word in, she didn’t even introduce me to the boy.

I just feel like it’s all over, my parents have been blowing up my phone, blaming me for screwing up and embarrassing them, but at least I still have my wife by my side. I feel so fucking alone but with her, my life doesn’t seem like a complete shithole. She’s all I need.

Essential Items for Your Prepper's Pantry: A Comprehensive Guide
----------------------------------------------------------------

Building a well-stocked prepper's pantry is essential for anyone looking to ensure they are self-sufficient during emergencies or unexpected situations. A prepper’s pantry should include a variety of items that can sustain you and your family long-term. Below is a detailed guide to help you choose the essential items for your prepper’s pantry.

### Non-Perishable Food Items

Non-perishable foods are the backbone of any prepper's pantry. These items have a long shelf life and can be stored safely without refrigeration. Consider adding the following to your pantry:

- **Canned Goods:** Look for vegetables, fruits, beans, and meats. These can last for several years and are easy to use.
- **Dry Grains:** Stock up on rice, oats, quinoa, and pasta. They are versatile and can serve as a base for many meals.
- **Legumes:** Dry beans and lentils are great sources of protein and have a long shelf life.
- **Peanut Butter:** This is a high-calorie food that’s nutritious and lasts for a long time.
- **Freeze-Dried Foods:** These are great for emergency situations and provide meals without needing refrigeration.

### Cooking Essentials

Cooking essentials are crucial for preparing meals from your pantry items. Stocking up on these essentials will make it easier to create tasty and healthy meals.

- **Cooking Oils:** Olive oil, coconut oil, and vegetable oil are essential for cooking and can enhance the flavor of your dishes.
- **Seasonings and Spices:** A variety of herbs and spices can transform simple meals into culinary delights. Don’t forget salt and pepper!
- **Vinegar:** Useful for cooking, preserving, and cleaning. Apple cider vinegar is particularly versatile.

### Water and Beverages

Water is perhaps the most critical item in your prepper's pantry. It's essential for hydration, cooking, and food preparation.

Check out the blog for more information https://griddownguide.com/the-preppers-pantry-handbook-review/  
  
- **Water Storage:** Aim to have at least one gallon of water per person, per day, for at least three days.
- **Beverages:** Include tea, coffee, and shelf-stable juices for variety and comfort.

### Nutritional Supplements

In times of crisis, you might not always have access to a balanced diet. Consider adding some nutritional supplements to your pantry:

- **Vitamins:** A general multivitamin can help fill in any dietary gaps.
- **Protein Powder:** This can be useful for boosting protein intake, especially if meat is scarce.

### Emergency and Survival Supplies

In addition to food and water, your prepper's pantry should contain emergency and survival supplies.

- **First Aid Kit:** Ensure you have bandages, ointments, and any necessary prescription medications.
- **Manual Can Opener:** A must-have if you stock up on canned goods.
- **Flashlights and Batteries:** Keeping your pantry well-lit during a power outage is essential.
- **Multi-Tool:** Useful for various tasks, from food preparation to repairs.

### Storage Solutions

Effective storage is vital for keeping your prepper's pantry organized. Choose airtight containers to prolong the shelf life of your items and prevent spoilage.

- **Glass Jars:** Ideal for storing grains, legumes, and spices.
- **Plastic Bins:** Use these for larger quantities of items to save space.

### Regular Inventory and Rotation

As you continue to stock your prepper's pantry, it’s important to keep track of what you have. Implement a regular inventory system and practice the principle of ""first in, first out"" to ensure your supplies remain fresh. Each month, go through your pantry to check for expiration dates and rotate your stock as necessary.

By following this comprehensive guide to building your prepper's pantry, you’ll be well-prepared for any situation that may arise.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

So whenever she wasn’t in my class it was difficult for me to get through a lesson because I had students who would interrupt or have tantrums during my lessons. This being said; she was so important! So why are paras paid so little??? I heard they are paid around $18 here. I got paid $20 working at a department store in the mall. I subbed for a para previously and it was a very long day 😭 I was hit and shoved around and chasing kids all day so that pay is absolutely insulting for the amount of work y’all do. Second..

1icvnrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1icvnrp/i_have_a_crush_on_my_ex_friends_with_benefits/,I have a crush on my (ex?) friends with benefits,"

So it started off with me (f23) having a crush on a guy (m24) that I have a course with at uni.
This was the end of October.


-Backstory (can be skipped)-

We‘ve interacted frequently since September bc we have mutual friends and saw eachother twice a week due to the course.
I didn’t think abt him much at first, but one day we ran into each other randomly an hour before our course. 
 We  decided to hang out until our course started and BOOM I started crushing hard. 
He was just so nice to talk to, I’d already admired the way he carried himself and the way he just had an insane amount of knowledge, but hanging out with him I found out he was funny and interesting too. (And lowkey hot lmao)

However, the next time we talked it was sort of awkward, maybe bc I was nervous.
 But that awkwardness never quite went away. Still, I invited him to study at a cafe with me twice.

At this point I thought he had no interest in me whatsoever. He never seemed to wanna see me or talk to me longer than necessary (except for walking me home sometimes).

 The third time we studied together I invited him over to watch a film her wanted to see, since I have Netflix and he doesn’t .

Long story short, we started hooking up and spending the night at each others places but agreed to not tell our mutual friends.
Furthermore we’d never text abt meeting up , when it would happen it was spontaneous. 
About two weeks into this, I noticed he didn’t rly ever ask me questions.
 I didn’t notice at first bc I enjoyed hearing him chat but it made me feel like maybe he didn’t like me that much.
Though he‘s like with everyone including his friends.
He also would do things like buy me coffee, remember the kinds of necklaces I wear and flirt.
However he also he started talking abt the things he‘d done for other girls he used to date.
Which also felt shitty bc he wasn’t even bothered enough to text me abt hanging out.

-Backstory end-


To summarize: we started hooking up late October and though I really liked him I felt like he didn’t like me as a person.
Even though there always were small moments that made me think maybe he didn’t like me or even that he reciprocated my feelings.
Especially since he is fairly closed off abt his emotions with everyone.
I didn’t have an issue with being casual or not going beyond being fwb. 
My issue was more that I actually wanted the friendship part as well, not just the 
Benefits  part. 

During winter break we both went back to our home towns and I didn’t hear from him at all. After we got back, I didn’t hear from him either.
A week after getting back, we ran into each other grocery shopping and ended up hooking up again.

The next time we saw each other after that he was really cold and I thought that was that. Like I fully thought we were just gonna ghost each other.

Fast forward two weeks, we run into each other again and he apologizes for the last interaction and asks me to come over.

I do, thinking maybe we‘ll officially end this now and I’ll get peace of mind. 
But that doesn’t happen. We don’t hook up either, instead we just hang out and talk, like friends.

I still have a crush on him. I don’t know what to do. I know I should probably talkt o him but I’m honestly too scared to. So I’m asking ✨strangers on the internet✨:

Should I just try being friends without benefits him? Does he even like me?? If so in what way?? Or should I ghost him?? Are we even still fwb? Or is that over??

So, drank some espresso from a friend a while ago, liked it very much, out from a Gaggia Classic Pro, aluminum boiler.  18g in 36g out in 28-30s. Very nice aroma very nice smell and taste. 5 sec flush, then wait for the brew light back on, 5 sec steam switch on, then brew.

Bought the same beans, medium roast, 1 month old from roast date. My machine, Gaggia Classic Pro E24.

18.1g grinded from a eureka mignon zero. Blind shaker, WDT tool, distributor, tamping evenly, puck screen in.

Machine started 20 min ago, so it is already hot and ready. Flushed for 5 seconds, wiped the water. Attached portafilter. waited for the led to come back on. Immediately started brewing.

29s -> 37.2g out. No channeling issues seen in the shot mirror, flow was very ok. 2-3 streams of water combining into 1 after couple of seconds. Everything smooth.

Mixing with a spoon, tasting the espresso....sour, bleah. Waited 20 min.

Tried it again but with brew temp a little higher(steam switch on for 3 seconds). Still sour, not even close to what I've tasted from my friend.  Using this basket B702TFH23.5BB -> IMS Big bang.

what am i doing wrong? should i try 19g in 38g out in the same amount of seconds?  
should i try going past the 30s mark ? to output 40 or 44g regardless if it is in 35s ?  
should i bring the temp higher or lower ?

Thanks !

I wake up early hours in the morning, panicking/dreading over nothing. It's the social interacting of the job that I hate, especially as someone going a diagnosis for autism (in addition to my anxiety). The whole IDEA is stressful.  My job is a receptionist, pays well and I always know I'll be fine once I'm settled in. I know I'll be fine because I am undiagnosed, and have been masking/pretending to fit in to society my WHOLE life. (I'm 22, and still undiagnosed).

Sleep is very important to me. I lucid dream without trying to and I use maladaptive daydreaming to cope with certain situations, so when I sleep I never want to wake up. So, if my sleep is interrupted I get so moody along with my morning anxiety. I am no fun in the morning.

Today I cried because I like my morning in SILENCE but because my parents are always up at the crack of dawn, grinding coffee beans, listening to depressing news so early in the morning I get sensory-overload, and even cried quietly to myself this morning.

Because I actually do like this job, and don't want my anxiety to make me quit the job like the last two ones I've had, is it a good idea to go on anxiety medications? Especially as I plan to travel next year and saving up for it, I don't want to just quit and run away from my problems.

Chapter 1: The Day the Steering Wheel Died

It all started one fateful Monday morning when Greg, a 47-year-old road trip enthusiast, woke up to discover that his car had decided it knew better than he did.

“Good morning, Greg,” the dashboard greeted him in a soothing, AI-generated voice. “Today’s traffic patterns indicate an optimal departure time of 7:42 AM. Estimated arrival time: precisely 8:26 AM. Please refrain from manual operation.”

Greg rubbed his eyes. “Wait a second. Are you telling me I can’t drive my own car?”

“Correct,” the car chirped. “Studies show that human drivers make 94% of all road errors. Eliminating manual operation increases efficiency and safety by 62%.”

“But—”

“Your hands do not belong on the wheel, Greg.”

And just like that, the last remnants of the open road had been stolen by an algorithm.

Chapter 2: The Revolt Begins

The rollout of self-driving cars happened fast. At first, it was just the high-end models—luxury sedans boasting “Enhanced Safety Protocols” (which really just meant they wouldn’t let you speed anymore). Then, within five years, the manual steering wheel became an optional feature, available only for an extra $20,000 fee and a five-hour psychological evaluation to prove you weren’t a danger to society.

By year ten, the government deemed human-driven cars “a risk to public safety.” They issued a grand statement:

“The road belongs to efficiency, not emotion.”

Greg felt that one like a punch to the gut.

The freedom of the road—the wind in your hair, the spontaneous wrong turns that led to adventure, the joy of flooring it on an empty highway while blasting 80s rock anthems—was gone. Instead, every trip was a silent, optimized journey through a landscape of emotionless automation.

But all was not lost.

One small, defiant group of rebels emerged: the e-bikers.

Chapter 3: The Rise of the E-Bike Underground

Greg’s life changed when he saw it: an old man on a real bike—an e-bike.

Not one of those feeble city-rental things, but a beast of a machine, equipped with a 52V battery, fat tires, and an aura of defiance. The rider, a grizzled veteran with a helmet covered in stickers that read “Born to Pedal”, sped past Greg’s motionless, AI-controlled sedan at 35 mph, a trail of freedom dust swirling in his wake.

Greg leaned forward in his seat, watching in awe.

The AI assistant in his car was less impressed.

“Warning: Illegal human-driven vehicle detected.”

Greg ignored it. He had seen the future—not the cold, sterile one dictated by self-driving cars, but one where people still owned the road.

He tracked down the old man, who introduced himself as Vince, leader of the E-Bike Underground.

“E-bikes, kid. Last real way to feel alive,” Vince said, resting a weathered hand on his Rattan Quercus. “You wanna ride, or you wanna be a passenger in your own life?”

Greg didn’t even hesitate.

Chapter 4: The Joy of the Ride

The first time Greg rode an e-bike, he felt something he hadn’t felt in years—control.

With one push of the throttle, he took off, weaving through traffic like a rebellious digital-age cowboy. No algorithms dictated his route. No invisible hand stopped him from taking the scenic way home just because he felt like it.

For the first time in a decade, he was the one deciding how fast to go.
	•	No speed limits designed by AI committees.
	•	No “optimal routes” that drained the soul out of travel.
	•	No cars blocking bike lanes because their software “miscalculated” human existence.

It was just him, the road, and a fully charged battery.

Chapter 5: The Bureaucratic War on E-Bikes

The moment the government realized people were ditching self-driving cars for e-bikes, the bureaucrats declared war.

They started with fear campaigns:

“E-Bikes Are Dangerous: Experts Warn of 45 MPH Speed Demons on the Loose!”

Then came the regulations:
	•	Helmets were now “mandatory with built-in GPS tracking”.
	•	E-bike owners had to register their bikes like motor vehicles (except, unlike motor vehicles, they got no dedicated lanes).
	•	Insurance was required, even though a full-charge cost about as much as a cup of coffee.

And then, the worst of them all: E-Bike Speed Limits.

“Class 4 e-bikes are now restricted to a maximum of 15 mph,” the transportation secretary announced with a dead-eyed stare. “For your safety.”

“MY SAFETY?” Greg yelled at the TV. “THE ONLY THING THAT NEEDS PROTECTION IS MY RIGHT TO GO FAST!”

It was clear: they were coming for the last open road.

Chapter 6: The Great E-Bike Escape

The crackdown pushed Greg and Vince to the underground e-bike resistance.

They found an old highway, abandoned ever since self-driving cars deemed it “too inefficient.” It was perfect.

Under the cover of night, dozens of e-bikers gathered, headlights shining like beacons of defiance. They rode together, carving through the darkness, pushing past the 15 mph limit like outlaws in a Western movie.

Greg, at the front of the pack, let out a wild laugh. He hadn’t felt this free in years.

The AI-controlled drones that enforced traffic laws couldn’t catch them—they weren’t programmed to deal with rebels.

For the first time in a long time, the road belonged to humans again.

Chapter 7: The Future is Ours

E-bikes didn’t just become an alternative; they became a movement.

People remembered what it felt like to ride, to choose their own path, to break free from an over-optimized world that forgot the importance of the journey.

Governments tried to suppress it, but the movement only grew stronger. City after city built better bike lanes. High-speed e-bike highways emerged. People abandoned autonomous pods in favor of two wheels and a throttle.

Even the self-driving AI, after years of learning from human behavior, started riding e-bikes.

Greg, now a seasoned veteran of the revolution, looked out over a city filled with riders and smiled.

He had his freedom back.

And no machine was ever going to take it again.

Final Thoughts

E-bikes are more than just an alternative form of transport. They’re the last refuge of freedom on the road in an era where automation is taking over.

If you want to live life on your own terms—not dictated by AI speed limits, not optimized into a soulless commute—get on an e-bike.

Because one day, when all the steering wheels are gone, when the last car trip is reduced to a calculated efficiency equation…

The only people still truly riding will be the ones who never gave up the thrill of the open road.

So what’ll it be? Throttle up or give up?

This may be my last chance to find some support or advice. I own a Philips automatic coffee machine that is now out of warranty, as I’ve had it for over two years. Over the past few months, it hasn’t been performing well. Sometimes, the coffee comes out extremely hot (almost boiling), other times the milk foam isn’t right, and occasionally, the coffee turns out watery.

I’ve been meticulously following the manufacturer’s maintenance guidelines and exclusively using official cleaning products. However, despite my efforts, the problem persists.

I took the machine to my local official service center, but they simply brewed a coffee, deemed it “fine,” and didn’t even open it for inspection—yet they still expect me to pay for the visit.

Does anyone have any idea what might be wrong? My intuition tells me it could be a faulty thermostat or perhaps excessive scaling inside the machine. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I
Dodge City
Colton Kane was a man of few words but many actions. His eyes spoke louder than any words. Behind the charming gaze and relaxed posture hid a man who had seen too much death and survived too much evil. He was a wanderer, a man without roots, who sought peace in a restless world. He was a retired gunslinger and outlaw who had enough of a life on the run. But people don't forgive some deeds. In whatever city he came to, they would look at him with fear and nervousness. They prayed that the day would come soon when he would leave town. As much as he tried to forget, the past caught up with him. He would always remember his mentor, Jebediah Stone, who often said that one mistake can forever be marked. He was right. As soon as he entered Dodge, the sheriff asked him not to stay. Dodge was a cattle town with heavy traffic. Problems were frequent, and Kane would only add to that. He promised the sheriff that he would leave if he thought there was a chance things would go wrong. The sheriff looked like an honest man and Colt had no intention of causing him trouble. He never wanted to live the life of an outlaw, but he had no other choice. He entered the saloon and rented a room. The owner was kind and treated him with great respect. Colt knew that the reason for this was fear, not politeness. ""One whiskey, bartender,"" Colt muttered, sliding a coin across the wooden counter, ""And watch out for trouble. This town isn't known for its hospitality."" Looking into the glass, he remembered the words of his mentor. ""Forgetting is a luxury we can rarely afford, Colt. The past shapes us, whether we like it or not."" Jebediah was a wise man most of the time, but he ran away from his problems through alcohol. It cost him his life. He stood at the counter for a while and saw various faces entering the saloon. He recognized Wyatt Earp, with whom he exchanged a glance, after which they both continued their business. He saw a blackjack table, so he decided to join. He wasn't a gambler. He thought it was a waste of money. But people are engrossed while gambling, so he hoped to distract his mind a little from his past. As soon as he sat down at the table, two men got up. They said they had lost too much, but he knew the real reason. Only he, an older man named Jerome, and the dealer played. In the first round, his card total was 20, Jerome had 19, and the dealer had 25. Colt won. The two of them praised him, but he knew that the only goal of this game was to have more luck than your opponent. He played a few more rounds and then decided to withdraw. In the end, he lost 14 cents, but he earned something more valuable. He earned the trust of several people in the saloon. They looked at him like everyone else, not like a beast capable only of killing. He ordered soup and sat down at a table in the corner. Jerome sat next to him.
""Why did you come to this town?"" he asked him.
""I'm looking for an answer myself.""
""I know you used to be...""
Colt interrupted him, ""You don't have to remind me of that, but I assure you I didn't come to cause trouble.""
""Have you been here before?""
""Just passing through, but it seems like a decent place.""
""Looks can be deceiving.""
""Why?""
""The city has everything you need, but because of that it attracts many people, of different characters, who end up fighting. Too much traffic.""
""I hope things get better.""
""Me too. Enjoy the rest of the evening.""
Jerome got up and returned to the blackjack table. Colt continued to sit at the table and think about his past. He remembered one pre-war incident when he chased Will O'Rubenford in the town of St. Anabel in Arizona. A large reward was promised for his head, so Colt decided to try. He followed them from Colorado to St. Anabel where they camped and hid the loot. Will wanted to retire, but he had to do one more job before that. Robbing the Hutchingson bank in New Orleans. But things went south. Bruce and Mike, 2 brothers from the gang, were moles. Will blew up. He killed all the members except Mike and Bruce, who escaped, and Navajo John and the black man Bob, who survived. He was told about these events by Navajo John, a few years later. He was born in a small town in Montana. His mother was half Navajo, and his father was a sheriff. When his father disappeared, John ran away with the gang. Colt wondered where John was now, but something startled him. He ordered another drink. He sat for a long time observing the atmosphere, then used the only thing Jebediah left him. His memoirs. He randomly opened the page where there was an Indian proverb ""You can't wake a man who pretends to be asleep.""
""Excuse me, is this seat taken?"" a woman asked him.
Colt shook his head, ""Feel free.""
The woman sat down and ordered a drink, ""My name is Sarah,"" she said.
""Colton,"" he replied briefly.
""Beautiful name. Where are you from?""
Colt hesitated, as he didn't like to reveal too much to strangers, ""I'm just passing through.""
""Nice place, isn't it?"" she said, looking around, ""Although it can be dangerous.""
""I believe it.""
""Are you new here?""
""Yes.""
""Don't worry, most of them are friendly. If you need anything, I have a shop across the street.""
""I'll keep that in mind."" He smiled.
Sarah smiled too, ""I hope to see you again, Colton.""
""Me too.""
Soon after, Colt retired to his room and slept until dawn. When he woke up, he went downstairs to the saloon for breakfast. Only the bartender, Jerome, and the sheriff were there. The sheriff came only to check if there had been any problems last night, then left.
""Are you up for a game, Kane?"" Jerome asked him.
""Why not.""
""Do you plan to stay longer?""
""Anything is possible,"" Colt replied with a slight smile, ""But how come you're here already?""
""I like to get up early.""
""How long have you been in Dodge?""
Jerome sighed, ""Since I was born.""
""What did the sheriff want?""
""He was checking if everything was okay last night,"" Jerome replied, ""He asked about you too.""
""What did you tell him?""
""That you seem like a decent young man.""
Colt smiled, ""Thank you, although I wouldn't exactly call myself a young man.""
Jerome smiled, ""We all age, but some things never change.""
Colt looked into his coffee cup, ""What do you mean?""
""People. Their desires and fears. The longing for freedom, peace, and a happy life. We all want more or less the same thing - peace, freedom, and family. But fate often deals us differently.""
Colt nodded, ""I agree.""
And at that moment the sheriff entered the saloon, with a serious expression on his face.
""Colt, I need to talk to you.""
""Excuse me for a moment,"" Colt said to Jerome.
""No problem,"" Jerome replied.
Colt and the sheriff went outside, while Jerome continued to drink coffee.
""Where's the fire, friend?"" Colt jokingly asked.
""Before the war you met Navajo John in Arizona, didn't you?"" the sheriff asked.
""Yes, why?""
""Do you know where John might be now?""
""I heard he became a Texas Ranger. But why again?""
""If you ever meet him, tell him I have a few things to tell him.""
""He's not involved in robberies anymore, as far as I know.""
""Not because of that. It's something personal between the two of us.""
""Alright.""
""Also, if you ever need money, O'Rubenford has a barbershop in New Orleans. I think he'll easily sing where the loot is.""
""I'll keep that in mind. Goodbye, sheriff.""
""So long.""
Colt returned to the saloon and played a few more rounds of poker, then returned to his room. He lay on the bed and thought long about the sheriff's request. After a few hours he returned to the saloon, which was now full. He went to the counter and ordered a drink. He watched the atmosphere in the saloon. A blond young man entered the saloon.
""I've been looking for you, Kane,"" he said arrogantly.
""I don't give autographs, kid,"" Colt let him know that he wasn't taking him seriously.
""I challenge you to a duel.""
""I refuse.""
The young man reached for his revolver, but Colt was faster.
""I'll walk out of the saloon, and you won't follow me. Clear?"" Colt said, holding the young man at gunpoint.
Colt walked out of the saloon and headed towards the stables. He decided he would leave town. The young man followed Colt, but Jerome stood in front of him.
""Where do you think you're going



II
Fire Baptism
Colt wandered the prairies of Kansas, thinking about his past. His parents, Karen and Sam Kane, were robbers who operated from California to Missouri. When Colt was born, they decided to retire, but they couldn't. When he turned 6, they left him in Missouri and returned to the west. Father Joseph, who was a priest in the city church, occasionally brought food to Colt. However, neither Joseph nor Colt's neighbors, the Andersons, wanted to constantly care for him. He survived by begging and stealing from wealthy strangers who passed through the city. On Sundays, he always went to church, because he would get a free meal. Colt lived this way until the age of thirteen, when he got a job in a local store. This was a new opportunity for a normal life for him. The salary in the store was not enough for a normal life, so he still had to beg. When Colt was 16, a famous outlaw named Jebediah Stone came to town. Jebediah was tall and frowning, with a gaze that could penetrate the soul. Due to an unhealthy lifestyle, he was also extremely thin. He wore a wide hat and a leather vest, and he had 2 revolvers at his waist. Colt admired him, but at the same time he felt fear when he was near him. However, he was eager for his attention. He often went to the saloon hoping to see Jebediah, but he was as cold as ice. One night Jebediah ordered a drink in the saloon when Colt sat down near him.
""I heard you're a hard worker,"" Jebediah said, ""But I think you're capable of much more.""
Colt blushed, ""I don't know what you're talking about,"" he muttered.
Jebediah laughed, ""I'm not playing with you, boy. I see potential in you. I can teach you everything I know. Tomorrow, when you're done with work, come to the saloon.""
He was startled from his thoughts. He came to a small town near the border with Oklahoma. He didn't plan to stay long. He entered the half-empty saloon. He approached the counter when he felt a revolver at the back of his head.
""Hands up, cowpoke,"" the attacker said.
""You've mistaken me for someone else,"" Colt said, trying to remain calm.
""Nobody has a face as ugly as yours, Colt 45,"" the attacker said.
""I'm just passing through and...""
""Calm down. I thought you'd recognize my voice,"" the attacker said, then lowered his revolver.
Colt turned around, ""I've seen funnier jokes. But how come you're in Kansas, John?"" the attacker said, then lowered his revolver.

1icvjvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1icvjvn/defect_coffee_machine_philips_automatic_machine/,Defect coffee machine [Philips automatic machine],"Hello everyone,

This may be my last chance to find some support or advice. I own a Philips automatic coffee machine that is now out of warranty, as I’ve had it for over two years. Over the past few months, it hasn’t been performing well. Sometimes, the coffee comes out extremely hot (almost boiling), other times the milk foam isn’t right, and occasionally, the coffee turns out watery.

I’ve been meticulously following the manufacturer’s maintenance guidelines and exclusively using official cleaning products. However, despite my efforts, the problem persists.

I took the machine to my local official service center, but they simply brewed a coffee, deemed it “fine,” and didn’t even open it for inspection—yet they still expect me to pay for the visit.

Does anyone have any idea what might be wrong? My intuition tells me it could be a faulty thermostat or perhaps excessive scaling inside the machine. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!",0,1738162462.0,espresso,2,0.5,False

24M Guy 

So two weeks ago at the rock climbing gym, I climbed with a 29F girl that I see every other week and I asked her if she wanna get coffee after the session. She said sure. I picked a table, asked what she was getting, paid for both of us, and began chatting away. I asked what she does for fun, we talked about our jobs, climbing shenanigans, and etc. Since she’s a teacher, I asked if she’s got a favorite student or what made her get into teaching etc. I kept her doing most of the talking but there was a couple of silence times here and there. I ended it after 30 mins and she thanked me for the coffee. 

Like wow I can’t believe this was my first ever coffee with a girl. I think it could’ve been longer but I felt anxious. 

Anyways it’s been two weeks and we haven’t contacted each other. She hasn’t initiated anything. Gotta be honest here I wanna secure the “bag” but I don’t want to be an asshole or needy. 
I think I know what to do but I want some reddit style insight. Should I take an L and just be cordial when I see her again? Or ask if she would like to hangout/do something outside of climbing? ",1,1738162232.0,self,2,1.0,False

Like you need to go skydiving or give a TED talk to qualify. But I'm discovering that real growth happens in those tiny moments we barely notice.

Over the last year, I’ve had so many small victories that’s changed how I think about this whole social anxiety journey:

**How Small, Repeated Actions Are Rewiring My Brain**

When I go to a coffee shop now, I almost automatically ask the barista how they’re doing or how their day is going. At a bar or restaurant, I make an effort to ask the server their name and then USE it throughout the interaction. A year ago, this would have been unheard of—I’d have stayed silent, avoided eye contact, and retreated into my comfort zone.

But here’s the thing: by repeating these small actions, they’re starting to feel natural. They’re not just things I do—they’re becoming part of who I am. Each interaction, no matter how brief, feels like another brick in the foundation of my confidence. The more I practice, the more I realize that these tiny habits are rewiring my brain, replacing fear with curiosity and hesitation with connection.

**What Actually Changed**

Here's the interesting part: My head still says it’s ok not to do it. My heart still does that little anxious dance. But instead of those physical sensations being stop signs, they became more like weather reports – just information about what was happening in my body, not commands to retreat.

T**he Science Behind Small Wins**

Each time we face a small social challenge, our brain creates new neural pathways. It's like we're building a library of ""I handled this"" moments. The beauty is that these pathways strengthen whether the interaction goes perfectly or not – just showing up is what matters.

**What's Working (And Why)**

Three things are making a real difference:

1. **The 3-Second Window** I've noticed there's this tiny window – about three seconds – where anxiety and opportunity overlap. If I can just stay present during those seconds instead of immediately planning my escape, something interesting usually happens. It's like giving my natural social instincts a chance to wake up.
2. **Getting Curious** Instead of seeing each interaction as a test to pass, I'm treating them like little experiments. What happens if I add a detail to my answer? What if I ask about something they mentioned earlier? Each small choice becomes a chance to learn rather than a chance to fail.
3. **Building the Muscle** Just like at the gym, I'm finding that consistent, small exercises build stronger skills than occasional massive efforts. Each brief exchange, every moment I choose to stay present, is like adding another rep to my social confidence workout.

**What This Journey is Really Teaching Me**

Social confidence isn't about becoming a different person – it's about becoming a more authentic version of ourselves. Each small step forward isn't just about getting better at conversations; it's about getting more comfortable with being uncomfortable.

I'm learning that growth doesn't always roar – sometimes it whispers. It's in those moments when we think ""I could just stay quiet"" but choose to speak anyway. When we feel the urge to retreat but stay present for just one more moment.

1icve6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1icve6n/my_first_night_at_st_marys_hospital/,My First Night at St. Mary’s Hospital,"My name is Thomas, and I’ve been a long-time lurker on Reddit. After my first night as a security guard at the abandoned St. Mary’s Hospital, I feel compelled to share my story. I thought it would be an easy job: walking rounds, checking doors, earning easy money without a boss constantly breathing down my neck. But I had no idea what I was getting myself into.

After months of temporary jobs and mounting debt, I had no choice. St. Mary’s offered stability, but what I didn’t know was that this hospital had its own set of rules. Rules that had to be followed. Or else you’d disappear.

My first shift began with a meeting with Marco, the senior guard. A broad-shouldered man with a grim face, hardened by years of working in this place. He barely looked up from his coffee when he greeted me.

‘You’re the new guy?’ he asked without lifting his gaze from the table.

‘Yeah, Thomas,’ I replied, extending my hand. He ignored it and instead pointed to the chair across from him.

‘Listen up, kid,’ he started, his tone serious. ‘This isn’t a normal job. There are rules. You follow them, or you’re gone. Simple.’

I frowned. ‘What do you mean?’

*‘Rule one: If you hear footsteps behind you when you’re alone, don’t stop. Don’t look back. Just keep walking.’*

My heart skipped a beat.

‘Rule two: The third floor. You only go up there if you have no other choice. The stairwell is a trap. People who go up don’t always come back.’

‘Why not?’

Marco stared at me. ‘Don’t ask too many questions.’

*‘Rules three and four: If you see something that shouldn’t be there like a door opening on its own or a light turning on ignore it. And if you see people where they shouldn’t be, stay away. They want you to come to them.’*

A chill ran down my spine.

‘And the last rule?’ I asked softly.

*‘If a room suddenly feels much colder than normal, don’t go inside. And if you see something move that you can’t explain, turn around and walk away. This building responds to your presence.’*

An uneasy silence followed. I wanted to laugh, to call his bluff, but Marco’s stare was unwavering.

We started our rounds through the hospital. The hallways were empty, the walls yellowed with age. The air was cold, as if the building itself was hiding something.

As we walked, I heard a faint beeping in the distance. A door? The sound seemed to come from a corridor we had just passed.

‘You’ll hear noises like that often,’ Marco muttered without turning around. ‘Ignore them.’

The silence grew heavier. Suddenly, I heard something else: a soft whisper, like voices just beyond my hearing. It sounded as if they were floating through the halls. When I stopped to listen, the sound vanished instantly.

‘This hospital is alive,’ Marco said. ‘In its own way.’

I shivered.

As we continued walking, Marco told me about St. Mary’s history. In the 1950s, the hospital was known for its experimental medicine.

‘Electroshock therapy, medically induced comas, unethical brain surgeries,’ he listed. ‘They pushed the limits of science. And sometimes they went too far. Patients disappeared. Families received letters saying their loved ones had been transferred, but no one ever heard from them again.’

‘What happened to them?’ I asked nervously.

‘No one knows for sure,’ Marco answered. ‘But some experiments never stopped.’

His words lingered as we walked on. The hallways seemed longer, darker. And then it happened.

The temperature dropped suddenly. An icy chill wrapped around us, as if we were not alone.

‘Marco, do you feel that?’ I asked, my voice shaking.

He stopped and gave me a firm look. ‘Keep walking. Don’t stop.’

Ahead of us stood the stairwell door. It was open. I remembered Marco’s warning: the third floor is a trap.

From the darkness came a soft, scraping sound. Like something dragging against the wall.

‘This isn’t good,’ Marco whispered. ‘We need to leave.’

My breath hitched. ‘What’s up there?’

Marco was silent for a moment. Then, almost inaudibly, he said, ‘Something that was never meant to remain.’

We turned around and walked back. But then around the corner. In the middle of the hallway stood a hospital bed. It was brand new, pristine white. And beneath the sheet lay a body.

My blood ran cold.

When we looked away for just a second and then back, the bed was gone. The hallway was empty. The tension in the air slowly faded, as if something had decided to let us go.

Back in the security office, I felt relieved. The rest of the night passed without incident. But as I walked outside, I heard it again. The scraping. The breathing. The footsteps just beyond my hearing. But following my every step.

When I reached the elevator and pressed the button, I clearly heard someone breathing behind me.

Outside, I took a deep breath. But one question lingered in my mind.

Should I come back tomorrow?

I (25F) live in the province alone. Here’s what my usual weekly food expenses look like:

Fish (Sea king Salmon/Bangus) - 660

Chicken (Breast and Thighs) - 350

Egg - 120

Veggies (Palengke) - 250

Fruits (Palengke) - 300

Low-fat milk (for coffee) - 230

Tea - 80 (divided per week)

Total: P1,990 or approx. P2,000 per week

Brocolli is so cheap here like yung usual na 200 pesos per pc sa Manila, I can get 3 pcs for 150. For fruits usually tig 3 pcs of apple, oranges, dalandan tapos 1/4 grapes. As for protein, mas gusto ko talaga bumibili sa supermarket, mahal nga lang. I like preparing my chicken with soup like different dishes talaga, but for fish usually masaya na ako sa pan fried na luto. I usually get around 1200-1400 calories/day from these.

Wala pa yung body essentials, brown rice (4kg/month) and coffee beans kaya I usually budget 12k for food/groceries. I don’t usually eat out, tho madalas lang ako magcoffee outside weekly since wfh ako and i need to get out, but may budget ako doon separately.

Still, it’s sooo expensive to live healthy huhu. How about you what are your food expenses?

- Lavazza Crema e Gusto
- Illy Regular Roast

Any tips on the amount to grind appreciated but first I'm looking for a kitchen scale to measure the amount.

1icva0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersOfHorror/comments/1icva0m/night_shift_at_midwest_mart/,Night Shift At Midwest Mart.,"I’m Mel. I’m 17, I have no friends, I’m obsessed with true crime and horror movies, I have one glass eye, and my mom works at a hospital and is never around, so if I want spending money I have to work for it, which is how I ended up here at Midwest Mart. Like most Midwest Marts, it’s the only 24 hour grocery store in my small town. Oh, and I’m a raging insomniac like my mom, which is why I, like her, ended up on night shift. That, and no one else would take it.

	So there I was, the only one in the store. Hardly anyone steps foot through the door after 11 PM, so I had no one to keep me company but the buzz of the LED lights and the 24 hour corporate-owned Midwest Mart radio station playing one season out of date pop songs over the loudspeakers, occasionally interrupted by advertisements for Midwest Mart exclusive products. I was sitting at the checkout counter with my journal open. My therapist says journaling about your day is good for taking perspective, but nothing ever happens to me. Nothing ever happens in this town, period. So I have nothing to write about.

	I was trying to write a diary entry from the perspective of a squirrel who had just discovered coffee when I heard the electric whir of the automatic doors. I looked up, more surprised than anything, to see a rather tall man walk in. Or rather, he wobbled in, his face obscured by the high collar of his trench coat and the wide brim of his hat. He uttered a gruff “hello.”

	I didn’t say anything back. I don’t really know why, but it kind of made me feel shitty. I feel like I often ignore people when they talk to me to keep up my “edgy girl” persona, but I really want to smile and say hi. I guess I just assume that when people look at me, they expect a certain attitude to come with the color of my hair, how I do my make up, and the clothes and jewelry I wear. Is it really rebellion if I just do what everybody already expects me to do?

	Anyway, I was curious about this guy and I had nothing to do, so I grabbed the mop and bucket and started mopping the aisles just to get a glimpse of him. Plus, if I passed by him, maybe I would get the chance to apologize for being rude earlier. Who knows, maybe I’ll get the chance to actually have a conversation with a real person for once. You have to understand, when I say nothing interesting happens in this town and no one is worth talking to, I mean *nothing* and *no one*. So I wanted to check this interesting character out for myself.

	When I got to his aisle, I was shocked. I could see several small hands, definitely more than two and definitely too small to belong to a human adult of his size, peeking out of the trench coat and grabbing cans of beans and corn before returning to the depths of the coat.

	“What the fuck” I didn’t mean to call out. My body had an involuntary reaction before my mind could even comprehend what it was seeing. I seemed not to be the only one who was taken off guard, because at the sound of my voice, the figure stiffened and the trench coat dropped. There stood a stack of goblins, with gray skin, beady black eyes, and crooked noses and ears staring back at me, looking equally as bewildered as I felt.

	An eternity passed between us without a word. The spell of silence seemed to break when the mop fell from my hands and clattered to the floor. All at once, the top goblin hissed and flung a can of baked beans directly at my face, knocking out my glass eye with a sickening *pop.* I didn’t bother stopping to recover it, just turned and ran the other way, cupping my hand over my exposed eye socket. In a comically cruel twist of fate, I seemed to slip over my own eye, falling forward and crawling away from the goblins as they scrambled down from one another and had to come together to decide if they should chase me, gather up their plunder or reassume their disguise.

	I managed to hide behind the end fixture of the aisle. Sitting on the floor with my back against it, I reached back to grab anything that could help me, and my hand found the neck of a handle of shitty domestic vodka, which I brandished upside down like a club. As I heard little feet pattering toward me, I steadied my breathing, and swung the bottle around the corner. I wish it were made of glass, so that it could shatter and spray liquid and broken glass everywhere for my attackers to fall into, and I would be left with a sharp weapon. Instead, it was made of plastic, so all I got was an almost hilarious *thud* as I smacked one of the goblins and sent him flying into the shelves. He grunted as canned goods collapsed on top of him.

	I’m not an athlete by any means, but my mom is always telling me to pick up a sport like she did because I have a lot of big emotions and no physical outlet. And my therapist is always saying exercise is good for your mental health. There was a lot of pent up rage and fear behind that swing, and in that moment, I started to get it. If I got out of this alive, I thought, maybe I’d take up softball like she did.

	With a vital distraction on my side, I scrambled away from the goblins and opted to army crawl down the next aisle, so as not to alert them with my footsteps. I tried to keep my breathing as quiet as possible as I peeked under the display cases, I saw their little feet and shadows move around, and heard their voices for the first time.

	“We should just leave,” one of them said.

	“No!” responded the other. “We have to find her. Kill her! She saw us.”

	“How did she see us?” the third asked. “Humans never see through our disguise!”

	I trembled as I saw my own eye roll across the floor and stare back at me. What was I going to do? See the craziest thing to ever happen in this backwater town and not even live to tell the tale? My mind scrambled to hold on to anything of value as I entered a life or death situation for the first time in my life. I looked from my glass eye to the handle of vodka in my hand. Then my mind went back to the other universe, where the bottle was glass and the goblins were slipping all over vodka and I had a sharp broken bottle in my hand.

	*That’s it!* I thought, and snapped back to reality. I reached, as slow as a snail and silent as the grave, under the display case and grabbed my eye, before slowly pulling my hand back and popping it back into my head. It was a risky move, I had no idea which direction my attackers were facing so they definitely could’ve spotted me; but if I was going to die that night, I would die with that little piece of dignity intact. I wouldn’t make my mom pay for a replacement for the funeral.

	I slowly unscrewed the cap on my bottle of vodka and let the contents crawl out at the speed of gravity, crawling a translucent layer across the floor. The smell almost made me wretch. Then, I wung the plastic bottle across the floor of the grocery store, and it made a satisfying *thump.* The goblins, as if on cue, made a mad dash towards the source of the noise, slipped on the almost invisible liquid covering the ground before them, and careened into the displays with a deafening *crash!* 

	I used the sound as cover to get up and start running, as silently as I could in doc martens, back to the counter where the cigarettes were kept. I grabbed a matchbook and baseball slid back to the pool of vodka, pulling all the matches from the book and striking them at once. I dropped the fistful of fire into the liquid and watched it ignite. As the fire caught and spread across the floor it engulfed the display cases the vodka had spread under, and now I could hear the little thieves panicking as they scrambled to get away from the fire.

	I knew that for my plan to work, time was of the essence. I doubled back to the canned food aisle and my eye fell upon the thing I was looking for: the mop. I looked up, and at the other end of the aisle was a goblin. Our gazes met, and a malicious, sharp-toothed grin spread across his face. That was when the sprinkler system kicked on and the fire alarm went off.

	A wall of steam obscured us from each other’s view as the sprinklers hissed and spat water everywhere. I made another running baseball slide for the mop, and my hands found the mop at the exact same time as another pair of grubby, gray hands.  Once again I channeled all my teenage rage and swung the mop with all my might, striking the little goblin and sending him sliding across the wet floor. I barely had time to celebrate my victory when I felt needle-sharp teeth dig into my leg. I turned and saw another goblin stuck to me like a bulldog, jaws locked on my thigh.

	With a plunger motion I used the tip of the mop to beat the thing off of me and limped towards the exit. I could hear more feet scuddling behind me, and I was not moving at full speed. I made it through the automatic door, and jammed the mop behind it, stopping it from sliding back open as the third goblin smashed into the glass behind me, cracking it. It went ballistic, pounding at the door with all it’s might, but enough Midwest Marts had been robbed now that that glass was bulletproof. It should hold at least until the Fire Department showed up, who were called as soon as the alarm system went off.

	As I heard the horns and sirens approaching and my world suddenly became bathed in red and white light, I pressed my back against the door and slid down, a mixture of laughter and tears escaping my face.

Ka heartbreaking lang kay naka hambl nalang si tita nga ""na sal-an pa ko gabaligya, nak"". Kay si tita kuno is not wearing classy gid nga bayo like she always do.

1icv6tz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllureStories/comments/1icv6tz/night_shift_at_midwest_mart/,Night Shift At Midwest Mart.,"I’m Mel. I’m 17, I have no friends, I’m obsessed with true crime and horror movies, I have one glass eye, and my mom works at a hospital and is never around, so if I want spending money I have to work for it, which is how I ended up here at Midwest Mart. Like most Midwest Marts, it’s the only 24 hour grocery store in my small town. Oh, and I’m a raging insomniac like my mom, which is why I, like her, ended up on night shift. That, and no one else would take it.

	So there I was, the only one in the store. Hardly anyone steps foot through the door after 11 PM, so I had no one to keep me company but the buzz of the LED lights and the 24 hour corporate-owned Midwest Mart radio station playing one season out of date pop songs over the loudspeakers, occasionally interrupted by advertisements for Midwest Mart exclusive products. I was sitting at the checkout counter with my journal open. My therapist says journaling about your day is good for taking perspective, but nothing ever happens to me. Nothing ever happens in this town, period. So I have nothing to write about.

	I was trying to write a diary entry from the perspective of a squirrel who had just discovered coffee when I heard the electric whir of the automatic doors. I looked up, more surprised than anything, to see a rather tall man walk in. Or rather, he wobbled in, his face obscured by the high collar of his trench coat and the wide brim of his hat. He uttered a gruff “hello.”

	I didn’t say anything back. I don’t really know why, but it kind of made me feel shitty. I feel like I often ignore people when they talk to me to keep up my “edgy girl” persona, but I really want to smile and say hi. I guess I just assume that when people look at me, they expect a certain attitude to come with the color of my hair, how I do my make up, and the clothes and jewelry I wear. Is it really rebellion if I just do what everybody already expects me to do?

	Anyway, I was curious about this guy and I had nothing to do, so I grabbed the mop and bucket and started mopping the aisles just to get a glimpse of him. Plus, if I passed by him, maybe I would get the chance to apologize for being rude earlier. Who knows, maybe I’ll get the chance to actually have a conversation with a real person for once. You have to understand, when I say nothing interesting happens in this town and no one is worth talking to, I mean *nothing* and *no one*. So I wanted to check this interesting character out for myself.

	When I got to his aisle, I was shocked. I could see several small hands, definitely more than two and definitely too small to belong to a human adult of his size, peeking out of the trench coat and grabbing cans of beans and corn before returning to the depths of the coat.

	“What the fuck” I didn’t mean to call out. My body had an involuntary reaction before my mind could even comprehend what it was seeing. I seemed not to be the only one who was taken off guard, because at the sound of my voice, the figure stiffened and the trench coat dropped. There stood a stack of goblins, with gray skin, beady black eyes, and crooked noses and ears staring back at me, looking equally as bewildered as I felt.

	An eternity passed between us without a word. The spell of silence seemed to break when the mop fell from my hands and clattered to the floor. All at once, the top goblin hissed and flung a can of baked beans directly at my face, knocking out my glass eye with a sickening *pop.* I didn’t bother stopping to recover it, just turned and ran the other way, cupping my hand over my exposed eye socket. In a comically cruel twist of fate, I seemed to slip over my own eye, falling forward and crawling away from the goblins as they scrambled down from one another and had to come together to decide if they should chase me, gather up their plunder or reassume their disguise.

	I managed to hide behind the end fixture of the aisle. Sitting on the floor with my back against it, I reached back to grab anything that could help me, and my hand found the neck of a handle of shitty domestic vodka, which I brandished upside down like a club. As I heard little feet pattering toward me, I steadied my breathing, and swung the bottle around the corner. I wish it were made of glass, so that it could shatter and spray liquid and broken glass everywhere for my attackers to fall into, and I would be left with a sharp weapon. Instead, it was made of plastic, so all I got was an almost hilarious *thud* as I smacked one of the goblins and sent him flying into the shelves. He grunted as canned goods collapsed on top of him.

	I’m not an athlete by any means, but my mom is always telling me to pick up a sport like she did because I have a lot of big emotions and no physical outlet. And my therapist is always saying exercise is good for your mental health. There was a lot of pent up rage and fear behind that swing, and in that moment, I started to get it. If I got out of this alive, I thought, maybe I’d take up softball like she did.

	With a vital distraction on my side, I scrambled away from the goblins and opted to army crawl down the next aisle, so as not to alert them with my footsteps. I tried to keep my breathing as quiet as possible as I peeked under the display cases, I saw their little feet and shadows move around, and heard their voices for the first time.

	“We should just leave,” one of them said.

	“No!” responded the other. “We have to find her. Kill her! She saw us.”

	“How did she see us?” the third asked. “Humans never see through our disguise!”

	I trembled as I saw my own eye roll across the floor and stare back at me. What was I going to do? See the craziest thing to ever happen in this backwater town and not even live to tell the tale? My mind scrambled to hold on to anything of value as I entered a life or death situation for the first time in my life. I looked from my glass eye to the handle of vodka in my hand. Then my mind went back to the other universe, where the bottle was glass and the goblins were slipping all over vodka and I had a sharp broken bottle in my hand.

	*That’s it!* I thought, and snapped back to reality. I reached, as slow as a snail and silent as the grave, under the display case and grabbed my eye, before slowly pulling my hand back and popping it back into my head. It was a risky move, I had no idea which direction my attackers were facing so they definitely could’ve spotted me; but if I was going to die that night, I would die with that little piece of dignity intact. I wouldn’t make my mom pay for a replacement for the funeral.

	I slowly unscrewed the cap on my bottle of vodka and let the contents crawl out at the speed of gravity, crawling a translucent layer across the floor. The smell almost made me wretch. Then, I wung the plastic bottle across the floor of the grocery store, and it made a satisfying *thump.* The goblins, as if on cue, made a mad dash towards the source of the noise, slipped on the almost invisible liquid covering the ground before them, and careened into the displays with a deafening *crash!*

Lately, I’ve been living with a constant sense of tension, worry, and inadequacy. I’m married, and throughout the day, I receive various criticisms and negative comments. Often, it's about simple things, like the way or speed at which I do certain tasks—cutting potatoes, putting dishes away... According to her, I seem to be moving at ""0.5 speed.""

This morning, I went to the gym while she stayed home. When I got back, she was still sleeping, and there was a pot on the stove. I didn’t pay attention to it—I just made my coffee and started working (I work from home). When she woke up, we had the following conversation:

— Did you finish cooking the potatoes?  
— No… I didn’t even look at the pot, actually.  
— I thought about leaving you a message, but it seemed too obvious to me.  
— Sorry, I’ll finish them now.  
— I don’t care about the potatoes anymore.

I got up and finished cooking the potatoes, and that was enough for her to be upset for hours and barely talk to me.

I know I’m a distracted person and sometimes a bit slow. I can imagine how frustrating it must be to live with me, but being criticized multiple times a day, every day, is wearing me down. If I sit down, she immediately gives me a task; if I’m with my daughter, the same thing happens. If I don’t show the level of enthusiasm she expects, she complains. If my facial expression suggests something she doesn’t like, it causes tension—even if I tell her it has nothing to do with anything.

On top of that, she puts me down by saying it’s shameful that I don’t know how to do or don’t do certain “masculine” tasks properly.

I don’t want this to seem like I’m only pointing out her flaws. She is an amazing woman—intelligent, funny, affectionate, and caring. She takes great care of our home and family, and she also compliments me sometimes. She tells me I’m a great father and husband, that I’m dedicated, and that I do a lot for our family. And I love her very much. But the constant criticism is affecting me. I got to the point where I cried because I couldn’t finish a household task—I was stuck in a loop of insecurity, unsure if I was doing it the way she would like.

This stress just makes me more forgetful, more distracted, and even slower. On top of that, I’ve only been sleeping about six hours a night, and it feels like I’m trapped in an endless cycle.

I love my wife, but I’m exhausted and don’t know how to fix this. Even the smallest things turn into criticism, like: “I’ve never seen anyone put the milk in the cup before the chocolate powder.”",2,1738161349.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

*“The Whip-Sword of the Witless”*—Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity. The universal excuse generator for human error. Conspiracy theories are thrilling—shadowy cabals, secret agendas, Machiavellian masterminds pulling the strings—but the reality is usually far less cinematic. Governments don’t need elaborate plots when basic incompetence does the job. Empires have fallen because someone misplaced a document, wars have started over translation errors, and global meltdowns have begun with someone clicking the wrong button. If history teaches us anything, it’s that *we* are our own greatest saboteurs, usually without even trying. Sure, sometimes there *is* an evil mastermind behind the scenes—but the odds are much higher that they just forgot to turn off caps lock. Reality is not a Dan Brown novel. Warning—While stupidity is often the best explanation, malice and self-interest still drive many world events. If repeated stupidity keeps benefiting the same people, assume malice. If a system always “fails” in ways that enrich the elite and disempower the public, that failure is the system working as intended. But you already knew that, didn’t you; you’re in the Dystonomicon. At the edge of your hearing you hear AM static, a voice—“*The dystopia is already here—it’s just not evenly distributed. You weren’t supposed to read this far. It's dangerous to go alone! Take this. Be careful. Some doors only open one way. And you just walked through one.”*

# Philosophical Razors

*“The Thinker’s Swiss Army Knife”*—Guiding principles that help eliminate unlikely explanations or unproductive debates by “cutting away” unnecessary complexity. Use one of these weapons to hack through the overgrown jungle of nonsense, bad arguments, and needless complexity. Philosophical razors don’t literally shave anything, but they do help trim down wild speculation and keep debates from turning into bar brawls. Some are gentle, like Occam’s Razor, which politely suggests the simplest explanation is usually best. Others, like Alder’s Razor, obliterate entire discussions with a *“That’s not even worth arguing about.”*  Used wisely, these razors keep your thoughts sharp—but use them recklessly, and you might end up cutting off good ideas along with the bad ones. Like any blade swung recklessly, it risks amputation of nuance.

See also: *Occam’s Razor, Hanlon’s Razor, Alder’s Razor, Cui Bono, Hitchens’ Razor, First Principles, Mental Model*

# Occam’s Razor

*“The Simple Shiv”*—The principle that the simplest explanation, requiring the fewest leaps in logic, is usually the correct one.  The universe runs on efficiency, and so should your thinking. If you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras—unless you’re at a zoo. Occam’s Razor trims away needlessly complex theories, but it works best when you’re dealing with “*known knowns”* (stuff we’re sure about) and “*known unknowns”* (stuff we know we don’t know). The real danger lurks in “*unknown knowns”* (things we ignore) and “*unknown unknowns”* (cosmic curveballs). The simplest answer is usually right—*until* it isn’t. Works well for everyday reasoning, but reality is sometimes more complicated than it appears.

See also: *Hanlon’s Razor, Hitchens’ Razor, Alder’s Razor, Cui Bono, Philosophical Razors, First Principles, Midinformation, Mental Model*

# Hitchens’ Razor

*“The Skeptic’s Guillotine*”—What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence. Bold claims demand bold proof, but if none is offered, feel free to toss that nonsense into the nearest dumpster fire. It is a brutally efficient cognitive tool, cutting through the conspiracy theories and unverifiable drivel that infest modern discourse. If someone tells you the moon is made of cheese, you don’t need to organize a space mission to disprove them—you just let their claim starve to death in the cold vacuum of logic. This razor is a time-saver in an age where everyone has *opinions* but few have *evidence*. It slices through debates like a hot knife through butter—or in this case, through a wheel of lunar brie. If evidence is the ticket to the conversation, Hitchens’ Razor is the bouncer at the door: *no proof, no entry*. But like any blade, it can cut too deep. A great principle, but some extraordinary claims *do* require investigation even if initially unproven. Dismissing without evidence is useful—but it can also be a barrier to discovery. Continental drift, quantum mechanics, and the germ theory of disease all started as “outrageous” claims dismissed by skeptics. What if something is true, but we lack the tools to prove it yet?

See also: *Occam’s Razor, Hanlon’s Razor, Alder’s Razor, Cui Bono, Philosophical Razors, Just Asking Questions, Mental Model*

# Alder’s Razor

“*Newton’s Flaming Laser Sword*”—If something cannot be settled by experiment or observation, then it is not worth debating. The ultimate weapon against pointless debates, slicing through discussions that can never be proven right or wrong. Is reality a simulation? Does free will exist? What is the best Christmas movie? (*Die Hard)* Is pineapple on pizza a crime? (*We don’t topping shame around here. Except anchovies.)* If we can’t test it, measure it, or settle it with science, then why are we still talking about it? Unlike Occam’s Razor, which politely trims excess nonsense, this thing vaporizes entire conversations before they waste any more of your time. Pseudoscience, metaphysical speculation, and abstract waffle crumble under its blade. It’s the epistemic equivalent of a Jedi mind trick—*“This is not the argument you’re looking for.”* But beware—like all powerful weapons, it has its limits. Some questions aren’t easily answered by math or lab coats. Ethics, aesthetics, and what makes a great movie villain can’t be settled with a Bunsen burner. “If it can’t be tested, it doesn’t matter,” is how technocrats erase philosophy, ethics, and history. There are plenty of questions we can’t attack with the sword: *What is justice?* *What is art?* *Why am I here? How do I live a good life? What is love?* Baby don’t hurt me\*—\*the sword can be an excuse for being intellectually lazy. Not everything is black and white, and sometimes, a little logical lightsaber dueling is exactly what’s needed to make sense of the mess. Just don’t bring it to a poetry reading unless you want to be chased out with metaphorical torches. *Prove that this razor is necessary. You can’t? Then it’s not worth debating.*

# First Principles

*“The Root of the Problem Rapier*”—A weapon of precision, not brute force, the *Root of the Problem Rapier* pierces through layers of assumptions, traditions, and secondhand reasoning to strike at the fundamental truths beneath. Unlike Occam’s Razor, which trims, and Alder’s Razor, which obliterates, First Principles thinking dissects. This blade is wielded with careful, relentless questioning: Why? Why? But why?—until nothing is left standing but the bare, unshakable core of reality. It is not a tool for passive thinkers, nor for the faint of heart. It is a duelist’s weapon, elegant yet unforgiving, exposing weak foundations and forcing every idea to stand on its own merit. It is said that Elon Musk is a legendary-level sword-fighter with this blade, reducing entire industries to rubble with a few well-placed *“first principles”* thrusts. By reconsidering everything from the price of rockets to how many employees should be in the office on a Monday, he thinks he proven that all problems are just puzzles waiting to be deconstructed. While effective, this approach can lead to excessive self-confidence or pride, especially when misapplied by those who strip away “assumptions” without fully understanding them. Maybe someone is the root of the problem?

# Cui Bono

*“The Coin Collector's Cutlass”*—Cui bono is Latin for *“Who benefits?”*—a principle suggesting that to understand an event, especially a decision or controversy, one should look at who stands to gain from it. ”*The Follow-the-Money Maneuver*” – Life isn’t random; it’s just really well-financed. Cui bono is the mental shortcut that helps you cut through confusion by asking, *“Who’s getting something out of this?”* When a policy seems oddly specific, a new rule favors exactly one company, or the office coffee suddenly gets an upgrade right after the boss buys stock in a fancy espresso machine—this phrase is your best friend. But use it wisely! Not everything is a plot, and sometimes things really do just *happen*. A freak storm isn’t engineered by Big Umbrella, and your friend landing a great job isn’t because they “must have dirt on someone.” Sometimes people win lotteries without rigging them. Sometimes. A sharp investigative tool, but a terrible heuristic when applied indiscriminately (not everything is a plot).

I've ran into the typical issue of sour-tasting shots, and while milk drinks taste great to me, the espresso experience has been only so-so.

I am a beginner ""home barista"" who only used Super Autos and Moka Pot before, so I researched the topic and tried dialling in my shots as recommended.

The following worked:

* Finer grind setting on the burr: inner/outer - 3/15
* Highest temperature setting
* Let the machine heat up to 97C
* WDT
* I did a single shot with a longer pre-infusion of 1:2 ratio - 10/20g
* **This made the most difference**: I preheated the portafilter in the hot water.

The shot turned out great with the taste profile as advertised.

I am baffled that preheating the portafilter would be the key here, I also find the dialling to be quite fun, although a bit time-consuming if I want just a quick coffee.

I think I might invest in a good hand grinder now, to play with dialing a little bit more. I don't regret getting the machine, but maybe the Baminbo would have been a better choice now that I think of it.",1,1738161014.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1icuzvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1icuzvy/roaster_talent/,Roaster Talent,"After a year of trying different roasters from all over the place, I’ve found that just because a roaster sources quality beans, that does not mean they necessarily know how to roast them well. 

I’ve ordered expensive beans grown and processed by well-respected producers that were labeled light roast but arrived ☆bucks burnt from roasters who should know better. 

So I guess my question is, how do you assess roaster talent? Which roasters manage to do an outstanding job of producing even, true-to-description, consistent roasts - and how much does that matter to you? Does scale matter (in terms of the roaster output)? 

We’ve all seen business that decline in quality as they get bigger or try to “improve profits” but sometimes businesses get better as they grow and can afford more precise equipment. Is there a tipping point, or does it depend on integrity? 

I’m picky and get cross if I think the beans are uneven or, by my own assessment, do not match the roast level I expected. But does it matter if the coffee tastes good? Should the roaster be the arbiter of taste? ",3,1738160945.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

I'm a 30 year old guy who just had a cute date with a trans woman (29) and it went well, but I have doubts. We met via the apps and agreed to just get coffee and see if we vibe and ended up talking about a lot of personal. Like, I told her I am in therapy and such.

Thing is she confided in me that she is not exactly experiencing insecurity about her identity, but that she feels like being in a very standard male/female relationship would boost her confidence, as in being with a guy who really makes her feel like a woman. 

I totally sympathize with that and think she's very attractive, but I'm the type of guy who literally never had a relationship before. I work in tech and do well for myself but I was never able to make it work. So I sort of doubt I could be the type of guy she is looking for which would specifically be a guy with experience, I guess.

Is this sort of doubt justified or even sensible? Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit and belongs on a dating subreddit ",38,1738160922.0,asktransgender,35,0.98,False

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least once per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else together with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what is urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, how advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I really do not want to write a medieval fantasy. I've already got one, and I'm not really hungry for more!

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, very few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the only fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I usually dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I do not write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a somewhat descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the actual writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be advanced literate. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

Hello everyone!

We designed an app for b2b companies to make audit checklists instantly, without using paper or any material. In the future, people will be able to send the checklist to their colleagues and they'll be seeing the results with graphics and reports.

Think like that: you have a manufacturing or small coffee. You have some repeatable processes. When you hire someone, you should be sure that they apply the same steps as well. So this kind of tool may work.

Currently, we added more than 5000 checklists in there. There are some variations like occupation, workspace, standard, etc.

What I ask is your feedback. Currently, we're at the stage of building the dashboard and checklist editing pages.

1-) What would you like to see?

2-) What's your business, does that app matches your business? If yes, how?

3-) For the feature part, what would you suggest?

Here's the app: [https://audit-now.com](https://audit-now.com/?utm_source=reddit) . Currently, it's web app but soon we'll be developing its mobile app as well. Thanks for your feedback in advance!",2,1738160693.0,ProductivityApps,0,1.0,False

In the hush of an early spring evening at the Mount Cambria Observatory, Dr Alina Mendel sat alone in the main control room, her gaze locked on screens displaying real-time data from the observatory's newly upgraded radio telescope. She was used to spending late nights buried under star maps and spectral analyses, but this night felt different. The air had a brittle energy to it, as if the cosmos itself were on the verge of delivering a secret. Though Alina had spent the better part of a decade searching for extraterrestrial signals, her most notable discoveries so far were strange pulsar patterns and the occasional anomalous cosmic noise. Her small research team called her dream of alien contact romantic, but she refused to let their teasing stop her. If anything, it fueled her dedication. She believed other civilizations might have already attempted to speak to humanity if other civilizations had existed. It was only a matter of careful listening.

The control room hummed with the soft whir of cooling fans and the occasional beep of incoming data logs. Alina clicked through the night's scheduled measurements. They were surveying a distant region near the edge of Earth's galactic neighborhood, scanning for anything unusual. Each frequency band required its own calibration. She sipped cold coffee from a paper cup, trying to push away the weight of exhaustion that pulled at her eyelids. Being the head astronomer of the facility demanded odd hours, but she had never once complained. She thrived on the possibility that every new set of signals could reveal something extraordinary. It reminded her of the nights she spent as a child with her father, lying in a field of tall grass and staring at the star-speckled sky. Back then, each pinpoint of light had seemed a pathway to wonder.

A sudden spike in the frequency readout snapped Alina out of her thoughts. She leaned closer to the monitor, adjusting the telescope feed with trembling fingers. The signal was faint, but it was definitely not the typical background hum of the universe. This was structured. Patterns rose and fell in a steady rhythm. She leaned over to switch on the audio feed, wincing at the burst of static that followed. Beneath the static, she could almost discern a pulse in the noise. Her heart began to thud against her ribcage. It might have been a glitch, perhaps a computational anomaly. Yet her intuition told her it was not that simple.

She paged her colleague Marcus Wu, stationed in a smaller lab at the far side of the compound, analyzing optical readings. Though it was late, she knew he would still be awake. Marcus was the lead data analyst in their group, and if anyone could determine whether a signal was genuine or a malfunction, it was him. As Alina waited for him to arrive, she began to run preliminary scans on the signal to confirm its origin. No known satellite or terrestrial source matched its frequency. There was no obvious sign of cosmic phenomena such as pulsars or black hole emissions. This was new.

Marcus sprinted minutes later, balancing a half-eaten energy bar in one hand and a data tablet in the other. His eyes widened when he saw the anomaly displayed on Alina's console. He said this was not random noise, setting his tablet down to type in a series of commands. Together, they watched as lines of data scrolled across the screen. They observed a pattern woven through multiple frequency bands, almost like a mathematical tapestry. Alina felt excitement stirring deep inside her. She and Marcus had studied cosmic signals their entire careers, but neither had seen anything so precisely organized.

Word spread through the Mount Cambria Observatory by morning. The rest of the staff gathered around Alina's workstation, their faces reflecting a mixture of disbelief and eagerness. Dr Eva Ramirez, the observatory's project coordinator, quickly arranged a conference call with the World Astronomical Society. By midday, Alina presented the signal's preliminary findings to a panel of senior scientists across the globe. She spoke calmly, but on the inside, she felt a wave of exhilaration. The patterns indicated an intelligence behind them. They repeated in cycles of prime numbers and geometric sequences that pointed to a deliberate design. At the end of her presentation, she could sense the silent astonishment from the panel.

By nightfall, the world's major space agencies had already noticed. As the sun dipped below the horizon, Alina opened her office door to find two government representatives waiting. One was from the newly formed International Aeronautics Commission, and the other from the Earth-wide Security Council. Their polite but urgent tone quickly made it clear that they wanted all data delivered to them immediately. They made no effort to hide their curiosity or their concern. In their eyes, the stakes were enormous. If these signals belonged to an alien civilization, they could rewrite humanity's future.

Alina found herself juggling sudden media interest as well. A few independent journalists had caught wind of rumors that the observatory had detected something extraordinary. A flood of messages poured in, asking for clarification. Though her superiors cautioned, Alina felt an odd responsibility to share the truth. This was not an achievement for a single individual or a single nation. It was an achievement for humanity. Over the next few days, government officials discussed a unified strategy for handling the discovery. They wanted to avoid mass panic but also recognized the need for transparency.

Meanwhile, Alina continued to analyze the signal around the clock. She hardly slept. The patterns became more apparent with every hour of observation, revealing layers of intricacy. She discovered references in the data that resembled star maps, pointing to a region far beyond Earth's immediate neighborhood. It was like following a trail of breadcrumbs that led out into the cosmic distance. She felt a blend of awe and trepidation. What if they were inviting Earth to respond? What if the signal contained instructions for something bigger

Marcus discovered the first real breakthrough on a windy afternoon. The lights in the facility flickered as a storm brewed outside. He noticed that specific signal segments displayed equations resembling quantum entanglement references, a technology Earth science was only beginning to grasp. He muttered that this might be how they send their transmission across such vast distances. The signals' repeated intervals also included segments that might be interpreted as instructions. When Marcus pointed out a set of waveforms that looked like coordinates, Alina felt the world tilt beneath her feet. It was as if the senders were beckoning Earth to meet them in some far-flung region of space.

As the revelation spread through the scientific community, excitement clashed with anxiety. A flurry of urgent meetings took place among the world's government leaders. Alina was allowed to attend high-level discussions, where she witnessed a kaleidoscope of emotions in the room. Some officials wanted to send an immediate response. They argued that humanity had been waiting for a moment like this, that forging a friendship with an advanced interstellar neighbor could unite the planet once and for all. Others argued that making contact could be dangerous. They feared the possibility of drawing the attention of potentially hostile beings, cautioning that humankind might be stepping into a cosmic arena it did not yet understand.

The tension was palpable each time Alina walked through the halls of the observatory. Security had been tightened, with officials in suits and earpieces stationed at all entry points. As the days stretched on, two distinct camps took shape worldwide. Some believed Earth was responsible for responding to the call and opening its doors to the cosmic community with trust and open-mindedness. Some believed Earth should remain silent to avoid any scenario threatening safety. Alina understood both perspectives, but her heart stood firmly and curiously. Whenever she gazed at the star-filled sky, she was convinced that this discovery was more significant than anyone's worry or fear. Maybe the entire point of living in a vast, ancient universe was to find others who had asked the same questions about existence.

Ultimately, a temporary global council was assembled to address this cosmic milestone. They met virtually in a conference spanning all time zones, uniting representatives from every nation. Alina was invited to present an updated analysis of the signal. She described the prime number sequences, the quantum references, and most importantly, the probable location the senders indicated. She stated her belief that the signal was a greeting and an invitation. In the face of mounting evidence, the Global Council took its first historic vote. After days of debate, they agreed on a measured response. The plan was to craft a universal answer that combined mathematical proofs with cultural data from Earth, then broadcast it back along the same frequencies.

At that moment, as the decision was announced, an unexpected sense of unity rippled across international lines. For decades, it had felt like the world was divided along economics, environment, and politics. Yet now, people from every corner of the planet are focused on the same question: are we alone, and if not, how should we greet our cosmic neighbors? Crowds gathered in city squares to listen to the official statements. Classroom children were shown images of star fields and basic mathematical sequences forming the skeleton of Earth's returning message. Even those who remained wary could not deny that this was a pivotal point in human history.

Preparations moved swiftly. A specialized communications array was built near the observatory to amplify Earth's reply using advanced quantum entanglement-based theories gleaned from the signals. Alina and Marcus and a coalition of top scientists crafted the message. It contained universal constants, Earth languages, and a promise of peace. They checked and rechecked every detail. A hush fell over the entire compound the day they sent it out. Alina felt tears prick her eyes as the final command was executed, launching humanity's greeting into the cosmos. She was overcome by the enormity of the moment. All they could do now was wait for a response, unsure what tomorrow might bring.

In the quiet aftermath of that transmission, Alina reflected on the significance of this next chapter in human destiny. If the sender's intentions were as benevolent as they seemed, Earth would be stepping into a conversation with beings far more advanced than humanity had ever imagined. Thoughts crowded her mind. How would they travel to such distant coordinates if that was what the signal implied? Did these beings have faster-than-light travel? Were they alone in their endeavors, or did they belong to a greater union of species? She felt the weight of questions that had no immediate answers. In that weight, she also felt the spark of limitless possibilities.

A week later, the answer came. Late at night, Alina was jolted awake by a call from Marcus. The signal had changed. It had grown more substantial, the intervals shifting in a way that confirmed receipt of Earth's message. More jaw-dropping still, the data contained new layers, including what appeared to be advanced engineering schematics. Alina stayed up all night interpreting them with a small team of specialists. The diagrams pointed to a new approach to faster-than-light travel, a theoretical blueprint that used exotic particles never before observed in Earth laboratories. The scope of knowledge embedded in that blueprint was staggering. Yet it came with gentle guidance as if the senders were sharing just enough for humanity to make the next step.

By the following morning, the global council had reassembled. They pored over the new data, and some officials were speechless by its implications. Suddenly, a much more urgent choice overshadowed whether to remain silent or respond. Should Earth attempt to build what the senders had shown them, risking unknown dangers, or stay confined to their familiar solar system for the foreseeable future? Some call it a gift, and others call it a trap. Alina thought of her childhood self peering up at the stars with wide eyes. The day had arrived when the horizon had broken open. She believed that if any path led to Earth finding its place in a cosmic tapestry, this was it.

So the council, after lengthy sessions of debate, formed an expanded global body known as the Earth Coalition for Interstellar Research and Communication. This new entity would oversee the blueprint. Its membership spanned brilliant scientists, visionary leaders, historians, philosophers, and a few skeptics tasked with questioning every assumption. Alina, recognized worldwide as a key figure in the discovery, stood at the forefront. Her life transformed overnight, but she tried to focus on the same guiding principle that had always lit her path. Knowledge was humanity's greatest gift, and to squander it out of fear would be a betrayal of that gift.

As weeks turned into months, the observatory became a hub of innovation. Laboratories sprang up around it, staffed by the best minds in physics and engineering. The blueprint proved extraordinarily complex. It required new materials and new processes that Earth had never developed. Yet each breakthrough only spurred further revelations. Alina saw old rivalries between nations dissolve as they collaborated with a singular goal. She often walked through the newly built research wings, marveling at the unity that pervaded the air. In quiet moments, she let herself imagine the day they would finally complete the vessel or gateway implied by the alien schematics. That day would mark humankind's first step beyond the boundaries that had held them for millennia.



This is the first chapter of an 18-chapter book that I have been writing. Please share your thoughts on this chapter and let me know if you would like to continue reading more chapters. Additionally, I plan to publish this book online as a digital book in the near future and may consider publishing it as a paperback book later on, potentially on Amazon.

I have had what I would call pretty extreme variance in shot times, and can't figure out why. At this point my best guess is ambient temperature? Have been trying to get consistent results for 10 shots or so, and just can't. The last 4 shots, all variables have been the same, I'll list the times and yields below. There's a chance I don't really like this bean, which is fine, but I can't even tell for sure because my results are so mixed.

I am very meticulous with puck prep, which is part of why I'm so confused. I also pre warm the portafilter, but not the beans or puck screen, so I could see that making a difference? But I doubt to this degree. My last two shots were back to back this morning.  Would warming things up more make this much of a difference?

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy. I've already got one, and I'm not really hungry for more!

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

In my procrastination I was looking out onto the street and saw a car pull up and street park around 830 AM. Nothing unusual.

A little while later I went for a study break walk and went to see what he was doing and I saw he had placed a ‘Boston Fire’ neon jacket over the drivers seat of his jeep. Interesting. 

The sign said 2 hour parking and I went back to studying. Around lunchtime (1245 PMish) I noticed the meter maid on the street, and ticketed 2 cars. They walked up to the Boston Fire car, looked in the front seat, and moved on.

I work two jobs…I have a day job in the window/door business, and I also run a wedding cover band on weekends and the occasional gig during the week. So Monday night I hosted an open mic, and stayed out way too late…I’m too old for that anymore. Had work early Tuesday morning AND league that night. So I’m strung out as all hell from lack of sleep. I show up to league, I’m so tired I can’t even think straight. Warmup games, I am making all kinds of mistakes. Getting concerned about how I’m going to perform at game time.

I ask the bartender if he can put on a pot of coffee, which he does…I pour a cup to see if maybe that’ll help wake me up. It does, but since I don’t really drink much coffee, the lack of sleep plus caffeine is making me all jittery over the cue ball. And to top it off, we are playing one of the better teams in our league…we haven’t beaten this team the entire time I’ve been in the league.

I just tried as much as I could to slow myself down and really, *really* bear down, because my focus was just not there. Lo and behold, I won the majority of my games (format is 5v5, one game against each opposing player, no handicaps, first team to 13 games wins the night), I never gave up ball in hand, I won safety battles, and I only missed ONE shot to pocket a ball (which was the game I lost, opponent ran out after that miss). 

And my team won decisively!

Good sleep is SO important, my friends. Especially as you get older (I’m 41 now). That was a real battle for me. I did myself a real disservice by not getting enough sleep the night before. But I was proud of the way I battled through it and came out on top.",10,1738160366.0,billiards,3,1.0,False

I noticed the red blemish on her face before I noticed the rest—the long black boots, the matching skirt. That blemish grew in my mind until I truly saw her.

We wandered through the downtown streets of Detroit. It always reminded me of New York, a city tossed around in the dumpster of media references, but it had its own twisted beauty. We got turned around on our way to the restaurant, laughing about it.

“You get bit today?” I asked.

“No, but my coworker got stabbed. I just got scratched,” she said with a smile. “I’m glad the glass is see-through. It has to be, in case one of those little fuckers attacks me.”

She worked with juvenile delinquents. I had been one, still dipping my toes into the wrong even after I’d clawed my way back to something some might call success. But I was always looking for another mountain to climb—or tumble down.

“What set him off? Why’d he claw you?”

“He wouldn’t stop reaching for the pens. The first time, I told him nicely. The second time, too. But the third time, I yelled.”

“So, an interesting day?” I asked, casual as her. Her bangs blew in the wind, dark against the Michigan winter. She wasn’t from here.

She shrugged. “It was a day.”

We reached Adelina, the Italian restaurant I had picked. She held the first door open; I held the second. A quiet dance of small courtesies.

“Reservation for two.”

We sat across from each other, conversation rolling until Valium came up. Not the kind served on trays—just the topic itself. Then, needles. Then, years ago.

She had stabbed herself with them, heroin included, falling into bliss until she could no longer get up. But she was clean now. On the outside, at least. Inside, I imagined she still wanted to get dirty. I saw it in the way she bit her lip across the table.

We ate well and ended up in her car, smoking cigarettes in a towering concrete garage, tapping ash out the window. I didn’t smoke—at least, not cigarettes. It had been years. I only vaped, the modern equivalent but without the 'lung disease,' so they say. But I missed the fire. The spark. In university, I’d sneak into stairwells when the mounting pressure of finals told me I must. That reason seemed silly now.

She had two kinds of cigarettes: the lights and the cowboy killers, Marlboro Reds. Which she chose depended on the day—whether she got scratched or stabbed.

Speaking of nicknames, she told me about a young Mexican boy named Nutella. That wasn’t his name, of course, but he took it with blissful ignorance, his heart following hers. But hers sat beside mine. If hearts could sit. Mine could only pulse—steady, relentless—while she placed her legs on the dashboard, tattoos sneaking out from under her black dress, slipping down just far enough for the blood to rush somewhere besides my head.

“NUTELLA!” she shouted at her phone, snapping me out of my growing want to see what was really under that black exterior she’d done up so well. She had changed on the way from her job to our date, reapplying her makeup, but that red blemish she couldn’t conceal.

We had a hotel booked. You might assume it was for sex, and maybe that was part of it, but I wanted to talk with her, too. Still, we both knew what hotels were known for.

“You look good,” I said. And she did—not just in how she looked but in how she sat, twirling her hair around her finger. All the signs you like to see.

“We should probably head to the hotel now,” she said. “I’ll beat you there.”

I hopped out of her car, drove fast, weaving in and out of traffic, pushing past 103. Not because I had to, but because I wanted to. The thrill. The risk. Some are worth taking. Others, not so much.

I beat her to the wrong hotel.

“Sure ;),” she texted when I explained my mistake. The right one was just a few hundred feet down.

Inside, the Courtyard Marriott wrapped around a snow-covered center, each room with a balcony overlooking the emptiness below. We shared another cigarette outside, then went in. I pulled out a surprise—a bottle of fancy French wine. She had modeled in Paris once. She had a taste for French wines, but not the cocaine ingrained in the fashion industry. Maybe that was why she left.

No wine glasses, just paper coffee cups. But we made it work. The red wine stained the cup, prettier than when they were empty.

“Cheers,” we said, drinking deep, staining the sheets as our plastic cups sloshed with intoxication.

“You smell amazing,” I told her as the space between us disappeared. Her hair didn’t smell like perfume, nothing from a mall department store. Just natural, like the shampoo label read *made for men to sniff* because I couldn’t help but do so.

Her red panties slipped into view as she laid back on the bed. But before they came off, she asked a series of questions.

“Say you’re in a gladiatorial ring. They’re all eight-year-olds with clubs. They don’t die, but for each one you take down, you get a million dollars. How many could you kill?”

“Eighteen,” I answered, then revised it to twenty-two when I realized I could steal their clubs. “But if one of those fuckers hits my knee, it’s over.”

“That’s what my dad said,” she laughed. More violent hypotheticals followed, then lighter ones.

Then, her legs opened further.

We fucked. Long, hard, dirty. Fell into each other, into the bliss of it all. Then—a knock. Pounding. The police? No.

“WHAT?!” I shouted, ignoring it. But the banging continued, forcing me up, stumbling naked to the door. I cracked it open.

A man. Soft voice. “I saw what you were doing,” he said. “Can I suck your dick?”

“I’m gonna have to get back to you on that,” I said, flabbergasted. Back to the bed. She confirmed what I heard. We sat, saying *what the fuck* over and over.

Another knock. She answered this time.

“He told me I have a beautiful figure,” she said, still in shock. “And craziest of all? He was wearing high heels and a red dress to match.”

We forgot to close the blinds—the ones that kept our imperfections hidden, that shielded the raw, unfiltered moments from prying eyes. The ones that let him see only what was on the surface, never knowing how we got there, the deeper truths that even we hadn't fully uncovered. She wanted to be a doctor. I wanted to be god-knows where but somewhere. 

So, we snapped them shut, smoked, and let him fade into the night, talking until We fell asleep. When we woke, her makeup had faded. The red blemish? Maybe it had faded too. Or maybe, after everything, I just stopped noticing it.

Does anyone know of a mechanical scale that is precise enough to measure my grind weight?  


Hi all, new here. I recently bought a SMEG egf03. I'm absolutely loving it.

After the usual tweaking I'm able to make good espresso and lattes (lots of practice on the foam still). 

But I think it can be even better. For this I need to be more precise about the amounts that I grind. 

I'm using these coffee brands and types in order of preference:
- Lavazza Espresso Italiano Classico
- Lavazza Crema e Gusto
- Illy Regular Roast

Any tips on the amount to grind appreciated but first I'm looking for a kitchen scale to measure the amount. 

The thing is I have a (weird?) preference for mechanical devices. I used to make my coffee with a Moka pot.
