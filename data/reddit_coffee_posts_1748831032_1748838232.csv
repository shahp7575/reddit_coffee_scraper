I took my firstborn out today as we never get time just the two of us. we got a coffee (for me haha) and went for a bike ride and to a toy store and before I knew it my boobs were in so much pain and I realized it had been 4 hours! I told him we had to leave so I could go home to pump and he seemed so disappointed. So how do you guys leave the house for longer periods of time? Do you have a wearable pump?

I twisted my ankle when my heel got caught in a crack in the sidewalk. Luckily I didn't drop the coffees I was carrying in a cardboard holder, but I still felt like crying with frustration. Not only did I have to get coffee but also make copies and order food for lunch meetings. I thought I’d be working on cases but I feel like hust a go-fer!

Back at the office I delivered the coffees and took a moment to check myself in the bathroom mirror. My white, long sleeve, button up blouse was still unwrinkled but it needed to be tucked into my black, pencil skirt again. Somehow my stockings didn’t have a run yet, but I had four more pairs in my bag since it was inevitable. I liked the way I looked, though, even though sometimes I felt kind of awkward with my 5’9” frame. At least a lot of that was leg and they looked skinny even though my thighs and butt were kind of thick. My cleavage was hidden by my high collar but my perky B cups weren’t anything to write home about anyway. I let down and then gathered my strawberry blonde hair again into a neat, high ponytail. Satisfied, I went back to my desk, the pain in my ankle already gone.

When I got there a junior associate named Matt was standing there, arms crossed impatiently.

“I’ve been waiting five minutes, where were you? Doesn’t matter, it’s Milly, right?”

“Mila.”

“Right, whatever. There’s a client coming in tomorrow and you need to order lunch. And you need to read and summarize these documents on their ongoing cases.”

He pointed to the thick file folder on my desk. It must have been about 150 pages.

“Have that summary to me by tomorrow morning. Got it?”

He walked away before I could answer. I was dismayed by the new workload but also excited. This was real lawyer work, finally!

*****

A few hours later I felt I had a good grasp of what this client was about. A business man, maybe kind of shady. Lots of travel, lots of deals, and a serious number of lawsuits to match. I googled him but didn’t find a lot of information online. I typed up the summary and left the office at 9:30PM, which wasn’t even close to my record of 11:45. By the time I got into bed I realized I hadn’t stopped thinking about the client. Such an interesting, mysterious guy. I couldn’t wait to meet him.

We dated for around 2 months, but the connection was very strong with lots of chemistry and fun. I even met their family and friends. 

They started pulling away around 2 weeks before the breakup, and I noticed immediately, trying to bring up issues just to be met with “everything is fine, I’m just stressed out.” And other excuses. Deep down I knew it was ending even though I didn’t want it to. Eventually they took accountability and met me in person at a coffee shop. We sat for a while laughing and telling stories, then I asked why they wanted to meet up and they went into the breakup (which was a rude way of going about it, why not start with that?) 

They told me they didn’t have romantic feelings, they “couldn’t give me what I need,” they “couldn’t have sex” (and they didn’t elaborate on what that meant), that I deserve better, I was so great to them, am a great guy, and that they’re sorry (over and over), and they want to stay friends. I told them I understood how they felt, that I saw it coming, that I was disappointed but there was nothing I could do, that I had worked too hard to learn to love myself to accept anything other than reciprocation, and that I most likely couldn’t be friends with someone I previously had feelings for. I asked how long they were feeling this way and got a long pause followed by “I don’t know”. We then agreed to leave and I thanked them for the memories and said it was fun while it lasted. They looked like they were seconds away from crying by this point.

So I left and didn’t look back. The breakup process has been rough for me. It’s been a little over 2 weeks of no contact. I’ve unfollowed her on social media but still check from time to time due to habit. 

Today to mark the start of pride month they posted a selfie with a nonbinary flag and a lesbian flag. So they are a lesbian. It’s making me second guess the entire relationship and I feel used. Like they liked the attention but maybe they were never attracted to me? Even though they said and acted otherwise. And another part of me is almost happy that I got to contribute to them discovering their identity and realizing they aren’t into men at all. It’s almost like “They’re not into me, but they’re also not into 4 billion other people, so it’s less personal and not as much something they could control.” So I’m going through many confusing emotions. Why couldn’t they tell me that? There were signs before but I ignored them because they told me they were bisexual (and they told me they liked me). 

I think I just need some help knowing how to feel and talking about this. I did nothing wrong and I know that. My self worth is thankfully unscathed, but I’m still hurt and confused. ",1,1748837257.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Main appeals are food, coffee, and museums with appeal to kids.

Background: I've road-tripped a fair amount in my younger days and have been through the area a lot. Very familiar with Chicago and Milwaukee; have been to Minneapolis, St. Louis, Omaha, Des Moines, etc. This trip is with my family (including our young child), and we're looking for mid-sized-and-smaller cities to check out for a couple days. (We live in New York but need to be near Chicago and have some time flexibility, so are looking to take advantage of being farther west than we normally go.) (Yes, I know, Chicago is hardly that far out, but our little guy is still acclimating to long drives. Hence.)

We're all low-brow foodies; I'm a bit of a coffee geek; the kid loves science museums and is recently really into the planets and space. The wife loves thrifting, hand-pulled noodles, and doughnuts (to name a couple foods).

Also happy to take recommendations for places in the more obvious places--Minneapolis and Milwaukee will almost definitely be on the itinerary, and possibly Rapid City (I'm angling to pass through the Badlands again), and possibly St. Louis if not and/or time allows.

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Stalking, obsession, mentions of seizures!<

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/eSnlsUYKxm)  **Apr 9, 2015**

My GF (let’s call her Kathy) is off at college. She lives in a dorm on her campus, which is an hour and a half away from my house. She comes to visit me on weekends. A bit rough on gas budget, but it works for us. We actually met at college, she was a freshman and I was a Senior+ taking a couple final classes to fulfill my credit requirement so I could graduate. I finished last semester and she’s still going. Long distance hasn’t been an issue so far, we just text a lot and spend the weekends making up lost time. She’s the sweetest, most easygoing person I know. 

But today, something weird happened. We normally text throughout the day. We texted during the morning, then she had class so I stopped for a couple hours. Normally she texts me at lunch, but she didn’t. I texted her and she didn’t respond. I figured maybe she was busy. I texted her a couple times an hour later when she normally studies. Nothing. I started getting worried at dinnertime. I called her and she didn’t pick up, which is really unusual for her. I started texting things like “Are you okay?” and “Please pick up.” 

She didn’t answer, so I started searching through my desk for my address book to find the numbers for her friends. I figured maybe her phone was dead or broken. But while I was searching, I finally got a response from her phone. It was “im okay sorry my phone was on silent…”

But Kathy doesn’t text like that. She texts with capitals and complete sentences with normal punctuation. And she adds smiley faces to every single text, which I tease her about all the time. I texted “Are you sure you’re okay?” and she said “everything’s fine [my name]...” That really caught my attention, because Kathy exclusively calls me by a nickname. Most of my friends do. So I dug out my address book and found the phone number of Kathy’s roommate Lauren. I texted her, “Hey, this is Kathy’s girlfriend. Do you know if she’s okay?” She responded immediately with “she’s fine she’s right here in our room with me…” No capitals or punctuation, ending the sentence with an ellipsis just like Kathy’s weird texts. I think she was the one sending texts from Kathy’s phone. I called Kathy’s phone again and whoever has her phone rejected the call before it was done with the first ring. 

I got another text from Kathy saying “seriously [my name] stop worrying about me ill talk to you later…” followed by “goodnight.”

Am I just being silly? I feel something really weird is going on but I don’t know what it could be. I don’t think she’s cheating on me. From what she’s told me about Lauren she seems like a totally normal person. I don’t have any specific suspicions, I just feel like something’s gone wrong and I don’t know what to do. Should I badger Kathy’s phone until she actually calls me or someone tells me what’s going on? Should I just let it go? I’m at a loss here. I don’t want to be the weird clingy girlfriend but this seriously isn’t like her.

**tldr; my GF away at college won’t answer her phone and all her texts are in the style her roommate uses and not the way she actually texts. Am I being ridiculous or should I keep trying to contact her?** 


---

**UPDATE**

Hey guys. Thanks for the responses, it calmed me down some. The situation has changed, now I need more advice.

This morning I did what I always do as part of my morning routine, I texted Kathy. I'd nearly forgotten about yesterday. After 20 minutes of no response, I broke down and tried calling her. The call wasn't even rejected, it went to her voicemail. I left a short message asking if she was still planning on coming over this weekend. I decided to take your guys advice and leave her alone from then on. I still felt like something was wrong, but I figured maybe I was misreading it and she just needed space. I tried to focus on work stuff. Stuff's going on in my personal life, but it is still a Thursday.

And then, at about half past noon, I got a text from a mutual friend of me and Kathy, Ben. The exact words:
Ben: ""Hey, [my nickname]. How are you holding up?""
Me: ""What do you mean?""
Ben: ""I mean, with Kathy.""
I called him immediately and asked what was going on, because I couldn't get ahold of Kathy. There was like five seconds of just stunned silence and then Ben dropped the bomb. *Kathy is in the hospital*.

I tried to interrogate him but he didn't know much, just that she was having some kind of emergency and couldn't take visitors. He said he had heard it from her roommate this morning. He apologized because he legit thought I already knew. He was actually texting me because he wanted to know if there were any updates.

I called Kathy and got voicemail. I called Lauren and got another instant rejection. I called her parents house and finally got someone. Her father said that a nurse had called early that morning and her mother had gone out there to see her. I tried to ask more questions but her father really doesn't like me and refused to tell me anything or even give me Kathy's mom's cell number. I've texted a couple of her friends, but like Ben, they couldn't tell me anything. 

So my girlfriend is in the hospital and that is literally all I can find out about the situation. She's been there since yesterday (afternoon? That's what Ben guessed) and she's still there today and still hasn't contacted me in any way. 

What do I do? Do I drive out there? We've only been dating for five months. I have no idea how serious this is. It's a 1½ hour drive. And I still don't know why her roommate went out of her way to hide this from me! Does Kathy not want me to know she's in the hospital for some reason? And even if that's the case, why couldn't she just lie to me herself? Or did her roommate go crazy and hurt her and that's why she's in the hospital and now her roommate is trying to cover it up? Everything is so frustratingly vague. I feel lost. Any advice or insight is appreciated right now.

>From what she's told me, her roommate is a normal person. Kinda flaky, lazy, and more...you know, promiscuous than my roommate is comfortable with (she's a very sweet straight-laced girl from a strict household), but generally nice. She's very LGBT-friendly, which was Kathy's biggest worry about living in a dorm. There haven't been any big problems so far and they've been living together since September.


[UPDATE: Lauren went nuts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/gGoCSF38iR)  **May 11, 2015 (1 month later)**

Hey, Reddit. Sorry I was gone so long. Lots of stuff has been happening. I’ll try to summarize here, and I’ll put the full story behind the first post in a comment.

Kathy had a seizure in class, went to the hospital, told Lauren not to worry me and Lauren misinterpreted it as telling her to lie to me. Ben tracked her down and told her off. I went out and stayed in a hotel and visited with Kathy and also found out from her mother what was going on. She has a rare genetic disorder which I won’t name because that would pretty much instantly identify her. Her mom is warming up to me, even if her dad still kinda hates me. Kathy got out of the hospital after a couple weeks but has to keep going in for checkups on the regular to make sure it’s under control.

Kathy’s recovered mostly. She isn’t supposed to do strenuous activity, but she’s doing good and managed to do well enough on her finals to make up for the work she missed and pass her classes. She apologized for the whole thing, for not telling me about the genetic disease and for saying something that Lauren misinterpreted as “lie to her”. I’ve forgiven her completely, I absolutely don’t think it’s her fault that any of this happened. I don’t even really blame Lauren for the first few lies to me, she was under a lot of stress and didn’t know what was going on. I do absolutely blame her for continuing to lie after she found out I was Kathy’s girlfriend and for the awful text she sent when Ben confronted her, (“hey i’m really really sorry but kathy is in the hospital and its bad she told me not to tell you sorry bye”) because what the fuck. But I was willing to put that behind us because I’m not going to interact with Lauren much.

And then Lauren went insane. 

Lauren started sending me texts begging me to talk to her and let her apologize. I finally relented and let her take me out for coffee, and she all but threw herself at my feet and said she knew she fucked up and asked for my forgiveness. I awkwardly accepted and she thanked me profusely and we parted ways. Kathy moved out of the dorm and moved back into her parents house. I thought everything was over. And then Lauren found out that Kathy doesn’t intend to ask for her as a roommate next year. And shit hit the fan. 

Lauren started blowing up Kathy’s phone, demanding to know why Kathy hated her and saying that she had already apologized for everything and why was she being so cruel and unforgiving and just generally making Kathy feel like shit. I called her intending to ask her to stop, and she started sobbing over the phone and told me she has a crush on Kathy and a crush on me and she can’t bear never seeing either of us again and to give her another chance. I was really startled, so I think I just stammered out something about how I forgave her but she needed to stop harassing Kathy. She worded it vaguely, but I think she agreed. I hung up. She did stop incessantly texting Kathy’s phone, so I thought it was over again.

Now today Ben texted me asking if Kathy and I had broken up. I told him no and asked where he got that from, and he said that Lauren is telling everyone, including a lot of our mutual friends, that Kathy and I weren’t together anymore and Lauren was dating me long distance. 

I have no idea how to react to this. Lauren seemed like such a normal person, and now she’s doing this shit. I told Kathy, and she said it seemed really out of character for Lauren and looked worried. Lauren lives far away, in a different part of the state, so we’re probably never going to run into her again if we don’t want to, but she lives near a bunch of my college friends who I did intend to keep in contact with. Kathy and I hung around in the same circles, and after I graduated she would sometimes bring Lauren with her to events because Lauren didn’t seem to have a ton of friends. So Lauren knows all of these people and I’m sure she’s talking to them. I don’t know if I should clear it up or just try to ignore her or meet with her and hash this out or…? I’ve never been in a situation like this before.

For more details [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/35monc/my_gf_19f_of_five_months_wont_answer_her_phone/) is a post I made in /r/relationships. Lauren (fake name) was roommates with my current girlfriend Kathy (fake name) in college. College is now out, and Lauren lives about 3ish hours away from Kathy and I but near a lot of our mutual college friends. I barely know her. Over the past month Lauren has started to become obsessed with both me and Kathy, especially me. I still do not know what incited this. She found out that Kathy was not going to request her as a roommate again come Fall and started spamming Kathy's phone with texts, calling it a betrayal of their friendship. Kathy was very uncomfortable with it and is bad with confrontation so I called Lauren up and asked her to stop harassing Kathy. She broke down crying and said that she had a crush on me and also had a crush on Kathy, but when I pressed she did agree to stop contacting Kathy. The texts stopped, so she at least respected the request. 

Then a mutual friend told me that Lauren has been spreading around the idea that she's dating me. Kathy and I got together and called her on speakerphone and Kathy asked her why she was doing that. Lauren tried to convince Kathy that I really was dating Lauren. Her story was that I'd told Lauren I'd broken up with Kathy, and if I actually hadn't then I was a liar and cheating on Kathy with Lauren without Lauren's knowledge. But Kathy kept pushing and eventually Lauren had a meltdown and started admitting some horrible things about how she's been treated like shit by past boyfriends and now she's trying to become a lesbian. Kathy suggested she get therapy and Lauren screamed that she wasn't insane and hung up. That's the last actual interaction with her either of us have had. She will not answer her phone. This was about 10 days ago.

Two days ago, Lauren drove three hours from her house to my parents' house and convinced them to let her in. She told them that she was my new girlfriend and they thought it was weird but let her in and she had dinner with them. She was (supposedly) friendly and perfectly pleasant to my parents, talked the whole time about how great I was and how she was dating me, and left without incident. She didn't do anything *wrong*, but I still find it terrifying that she somehow tracked down my parents' address and took a 6 hour round trip just to try to convince them she's dating me. 

This is really freaking me out. Lauren seemed like such a normal person from Kathy's descriptions in college and the couple times I met her, and that's how she comes off to everyone else, too. A lot of people have started giving me weird looks and implying that *I'm* the one lying when I deny that I'm dating her now. She hasn't made any threats, she stopped contacting me and my girlfriend when I requested it, she hasn't come near me personally. But she *drove for three fucking hours to try to convince my family that she's dating me*. Does this qualify as harassment or stalking? Can I get a restraining order? I'm afraid of what she'll do next, but I don't know if I have enough of a case to take any preemptive action against her yet. And I'm very afraid it won't be taken seriously because all of the people involved are women. I've heard horror stories about the police disregarding harassment and even sexual assault in the lesbian community. I'm losing sleep over this. Please help. Thank you.

>My mom and I have never been really close. There's a reason she's far enough removed from my life to not find it weird that I'd break up with a serious girlfriend without her knowing about it. She's been like this my entire life, I don't think she's going to change now. It sounds harsh, but I've sort of accepted that it's best if I keep her at arm's length and just act civil towards her at Christmas and when I go to visit my dad. It does hurt that she'd trust Lauren over me, but I try not to tie my emotions to her reactions anymore.

I’m here to spill the tea, share my honest thoughts, and give you the nitty-gritty on why this stuff deserves a spot in your cabinet—or, heck, even your car trunk (for emergencies, obviously).

So, whether you’re a pro massage therapist, a self-care junkie, or just someone tired of weird, questionable massage creams, you’re in the right spot. Ready to find out if Bon Vital Complete Massage Creme is the real MVP? Let’s get into it!

**What’s the Big Deal with Bon Vital Complete Massage Creme?**

Let’s cut to the chase: **Bon Vital Complete Massage Creme** isn’t your average, run-of-the-mill lotion. You know the type—lotion that promises the world but barely makes it past your elbows? Yeah, this isn’t that.

I tried this cream on a whim. Honestly, I expected it to be “just another cream.” Spoiler alert: I was wrong. The texture alone made me rethink everything I thought I knew about massage creams.

**Key Features That Make Bon Vital Stand Out:**

* **Perfect Consistency:** Not too thick, not too thin. Goldilocks would absolutely approve.
* **Non-Greasy Formula:** I can actually touch my phone after using it (which, FYI, is a big deal in my book).
* **Long-Lasting Glide:** Whether you’re a pro or just giving your partner a quick shoulder rub, this cream holds up.
* **Hypoallergenic & Unscented:** No weird perfumes. No breakouts. Just pure, skin-loving goodness.
* **Enriched with Botanicals:** Think of it as a superfood smoothie, but for your skin.

Ever tried a massage cream that left you smelling like a bouquet of artificial flowers? Yeah, me too. Bon Vital? None of that nonsense.

**Breaking Down the Ingredients: What’s Actually Inside?**

I know what you’re thinking: “All these creams say they’re the best, but what’s actually in them?” Good question! Let’s break it down.

**Main Ingredients (and Why They Rock):**

* **Jojoba Oil:** This stuff mimics your skin’s natural oils, so it absorbs easily without clogging pores. Translation: happy, hydrated skin.
* **Vitamin E:** Not just for your grandma’s face cream anymore. It helps repair and protect your skin—bonus!
* **Aloe Vera:** Calms and soothes, so you won’t walk away looking like a tomato (unless you want to, no judgment).
* **Safflower Oil:** Lightweight and non-greasy, this is the unsung hero of the blend.
* **Botanical Extracts:** Chamomile, arnica, and more add to the skin-loving formula.

I honestly love reading an ingredient list and recognizing everything on it. If I can’t pronounce it, I probably don’t want it on my body. You feel me?

**Performance: How Does Bon Vital Creme Actually Feel?**

Let’s be real: all the fancy ingredients in the world mean nothing if the cream feels like glue or disappears five minutes into your massage. So how does Bon Vital stack up?

**My Hands-On Experience:**

I slathered this cream on for a 60-minute at-home massage, and I barely needed to reapply. The glide stayed smooth, my hands didn’t stick, and (wait for it) the cream actually absorbed at the end—no oily mess, no need for a post-massage shower. I even got a “Wow, that was actually relaxing” from my partner. Trust me, that’s a rare review.

**Biggest Wins:**

* **No greasy residue:** I didn’t feel like I’d just deep-fried my arms.
* **Excellent absorption:** My skin felt soft, not coated.
* **Easy to wash off:** No scrubbing required.

Ever tried a cream that just sits on top of your skin like a clingy ex? Bon Vital isn’t that needy. 😉

**Who Should Use Bon Vital Complete Massage Creme?**

Here’s the million-dollar question: Is this cream just for pro massage therapists, or can regular folks get in on the action? IMO, this cream is for **everyone**.

**Perfect For:**

* **Professional massage therapists:** You want consistent glide and a non-sticky finish? This is it.
* **Home users:** If you’re into self-massage or partner massages, you’ll love how easy this is to use.
* **Sensitive skin types:** I haven’t had a single breakout or irritation, and my skin throws tantrums for way less.
* **Anyone sick of weird scents:** Seriously, you can use this and not smell like a walking air freshener.

**When Should You Not Use It?**

Honestly, unless you’re actively allergic to one of the plant oils or extracts, I can’t think of a reason. If you don’t like awesome skin, maybe skip it? Just kidding… sort of.

**How to Use Bon Vital Complete Massage Creme (Without Wasting a Drop)**

I learned the hard way that a little goes a long way. I once squeezed out a golf-ball sized blob and ended up moisturizing my entire arm. So, pro tip: **start small**.

**Application Tips:**

1. **Start with a dime-sized amount.** You can always add more, but you can’t put it back in the tube. Trust me, I’ve tried.
2. **Warm it up between your hands.** Cold cream = not relaxing.
3. **Apply in slow, even strokes.** The cream glides beautifully, so let it do its thing.
4. **Reapply if needed.** For longer massages, a tiny bit extra can go a long way.

I’ve even used it as a hand cream in a pinch. Multi-tasking? Yes, please!

**Bon Vital vs. The Competition: Is It Really That Good?**

I’ve tested way too many creams over the years. Some were so greasy I felt like I’d dipped my hands in fryer oil, while others dried up faster than my enthusiasm for cardio. Here’s how Bon Vital Complete Massage Creme compares:

**Bon Vital Complete Massage Creme vs. Standard Lotion:**

* **Glide:** Bon Vital wins by a mile. Your hands won’t drag.
* **Absorption:** No sticky or greasy feeling. Standard lotions? Not so much.
* **Scent:** Bon Vital stays neutral. Standard lotions can be overwhelming.

**Bon Vital vs. Oil-Based Massage Creams:**

* **No slip-and-slide:** Oil-based creams turn you into a slip hazard. Bon Vital keeps things controlled.
* **Less mess:** You won’t need to wash your sheets twice.
* **Better skin feel:** No lingering oiliness after the massage.

If you want a quick summary: **Bon Vital is that rare unicorn that actually delivers on its promises.**

**Common Questions (Because I Know You’re Wondering)**

Ever had a burning question about a product, but nobody seems to answer it? Here’s my take on the most common “but what about…” concerns:

**Is Bon Vital Complete Massage Creme safe for sensitive skin?**  
Absolutely! I have skin that gets mad at me for looking at it the wrong way, and I’ve had zero problems.

**Does it stain sheets or clothes?**  
Nope. I’ve tried it on light and dark sheets, and it washes out easily. Pro tip: Don’t pour half the bottle out at once. Your laundry will thank you.

**Can I use this for facial massages?**  
You can, but I’d patch test first if your face is super sensitive. It’s gentle, but everyone’s skin is different.

**How’s the price?**  
Honestly, you get what you pay for. The bottle lasts forever, so IMO, it’s worth every penny.

**Honest Pros and Cons**

Let’s keep it 100% honest. No product is *perfect*, but Bon Vital Complete Massage Creme comes pretty darn close.

**Pros:**

* **Non-greasy, non-sticky finish**
* **Great for all skin types**
* **Long-lasting and a little goes a long way**
* **No overpowering scent**
* **Washes out of fabrics easily**

**Cons:**

* **Price is a bit higher than drugstore brands** (but, you get what you pay for)
* **Some people might want a scented version** (but honestly, unscented is a blessing)
* **The pump bottle sometimes gets stuck** (minor, but worth mentioning)

If you want a cream that actually makes you look forward to massages (and doesn’t destroy your sheets), this is it.

**Why I Keep Coming Back to Bon Vital**

Let me be real: I’ve tried to “cheat” on Bon Vital with cheaper creams. Every time, I regret it. My skin doesn’t feel as good, the massage never lasts as long, and I end up back at square one. It’s kind of like switching from your favorite coffee to the generic brand—why bother?

**Bonus: My Unexpected Uses for Bon Vital Creme**

Okay, confession time. I’ve used Bon Vital for more than just massages. Here are a few of my “creative” uses:

* **Hand cream after too much hand sanitizer** (thanks, 2020s)
* **Elbow and knee moisturizer** (because, why not?)
* **Quick fix for dry feet** (don’t judge me until you try it)

I even caught my partner using it as a post-shave lotion once. I mean, I can’t blame him.

**Final Thoughts: Is Bon Vital Complete Massage Creme Worth Your Money?**

If you’re tired of wasting cash on creams that promise the moon but deliver a soggy pancake, give **Bon Vital Complete Massage Creme** a shot. Your skin (and your massage partner) will thank you. Plus, you’ll finally have a cream that does what it says—no BS, no greasy mess, just pure, relaxing goodness.

So, next time you’re stocking up on self-care essentials, ask yourself: **Do I want to keep settling for “meh,” or am I ready for the best massage cream out there?** (Hint: You deserve the best.)

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/1ro2GeCQvK): **May 10, 2025**

I just created this account because my friend suggested I post here and maybe get some advice too. I don't know how to format for reddit, but he said to make sure that I did.

I live on a large property with a small house in the front. There are many small hot springs in the semi-rural mountain area that I live in, with many used by homeowners in their backyard. Many are piped indoors, but some have hot tubs built around them. I happen to have a active one in my backyard (picture an in-ground hot tub being fed in from the hot spring) near my left neighbors house (I'll call her CN for crazy neighbor). A small stream runs through the far backyards of the neighborhood and it used for gardens and little nature areas that everyone on the street enjoys. I have my small fruit/pepper garden watered by this stream and take really good care of it. For some visualization, it has a good amount of water flowing down and everyone on the street uses it some way. My right neighbor (who's a really chill dude, who I'll call Jay) has small pools he made that are fed by the stream, and two neighbors down has a garden similar to mine. Now on to the actual story.

When I bought the house, the previous owners were sued by CN, her claiming that the land was rightfully hers. I don't know the details of her argument, but it was thrown out (as far as I know). The previous owners warned me of CN and not to engage with her family. When I moved in, CN's kids (I'd say probably 8, 9, and 10) brought over cookies and welcomed me to the neighborhood. I thought that the previous owner was exaggerating as they seemed sweet. I invited CN and her family to a small BBQ and they accepted. The second that they got in the house, CN started to explain the 'rules of the neighborhood'. I thought it was pretty normal (like to not play loud music after 9, keep your car in the driveway to keep the street uncluttered, etc. Common sense rules) until she got to some rules reguarding the stream and the hot springs.

She said that kids were allowed in all parts of the stream (in private backyards) and that everyone could use each other's hot springs (I have the only hot spring on the street, so I was surprised by that). I interrupted her and told her that I wasn't comfortable with those, and she scoffed, saying that all neighbors were fine with it. I told her that I still wasn't comfortable with it. She ignored me, continuing with some questionable rules. The rest of the night was fine, but I felt like I wouldn't want to do it again.

I talked to some neighbors across the next couple days, who all told me to steer clear of CN and that her rules were BS. I went over to CN's house and told her that I had talked to the other neighbors and that I wasn't comfortable with anyone being in my backyard without my permission. She scoffed and said ok. I had a lunch with Jay and he told me who CN was: A serial suer with her lawyer on speed dial to get whatever she wants. CN had sued a small chain pizza place in town into debt for having peanut oil on her pizza when she was allergic to it. The pizza chain didn't even have peanut oil (and many people in the small community believed that she put it on), but still lost everything. I decided not to ever talk to her or her family.

A week later, I got home from the grocery store to see CN's kids (I'll call them EKs for entitled kids) splashing in my hot spring tub (its outside and usually has a lid on that two small kids would definitely not be able to take off as it is heavy and large). I tell them that they're not allowed in it and to leave my yard immediately, and they stand their ground, telling me that their mom (CN) told them that it was theirs and that they could use it. I told them that that's not true and to leave now. They finally do. Before you think that I'm an asshole for that, remember that pools/hot tubs are dangerous and I don't want to be liab le. I headed back out to buy locks for my gates. When I got back, CN was now there, demanding why I kicked her kids out. She reminded me of the ""rules"", but I told her to leave immediately and that my security camera was recording. She cursed at me for a min or two, then left. I was bluffing as I did not have security cameras, but I did order them on amazon that night. The next day was fine, replanting a lot of my plants from my apartment's balcony into the empty garden (the one that's watered by the stream). I noticed that CN kept looking over the fence.

For the following weeks, CN complained about the trees in my yard, the color of the fence, what I'm doing with the stream, etc. Jay occasionally came over and told her to f off. Three weeks ago, I left for a couple days for a friend's wedding. I kept getting security alerts saying that there was motion in my backyard, often her kids playing in my garden (trampling my dear shishito peppers). I texted Jay to tell them to get out. If you're wondering why not call the police, they wouldn't do anything as they're just some kids. I had a suspicion that CN was telling them to do these things, but I didn't have much evidence.

On the drive back, I got a security alert that there was motion in my backyard. I didn't check as I was driving, but when I stopped for gas, I checked and saw CN instructing a plumbing team installing piping from MY hotspring into THEIR yard. I had it save all of the footage and I sent messages to Jay about it. Jay told them that they weren't allowed to be doing that, but since it wasn't his house, they didn't listen to him. I called the police and they went, but they had already installed the piping. The team was just leaving through the gate (with a broken lock on the ground), when the police showed up. They said that they had been hired by the homeowner. The police waited for me to get there while talking to the team of workers, and I told them that I was the homeowner and that I hadn't payed them to do it. They looked confused. I went with the police into the backyard and I started ripping the unsecured piping out with a crowbar.

CN starts shrieking from her yard and puts her head over the fence and starts yelling that I'm destroying private property and that she would sue me. CN then says that she has a contract with the owner of the house to have their (my) hot spring water. The police are now confused. She shows a contract that read that she was paying me $2 per month in exchange for the water. CN won't give it to me so I could look at it besides waving it around in the air. The police eventually leave and warn me not to destroy the piping. I ripped up the small pipe that connects to the source as she's telling me that she'll see me in court. I contacted my lawyer and she said that CN had no case as she didn't know my signature and it would be easy to prove it was forged. I still haven't been served by CN's lawyer, but know that I will soon. In the meantime, I've been sitting in the hot tub for long baths while talking to myself loudly about how much I love it. Petty, but it made me feel good hearing the growls from across the fence.

This is the final thing that made me post here, my garden wilting and dying at an unnatural rate. I heard a commotion out in CN's yard and I peeked over and saw her slowly pouring a massive jug of chemicals into the communal stream, which goes down to mine. I don't know if its herbicides, plant killer, or something like bleach (it doesn't smell like bleach so I don't think its that), but its rapidly killing my plants. I haven't eaten any of the fruit/peppers since as I'm worried I might get sick. I think that if I can get definitive proof of her doing it, I can maybe use it in court to prove how crazy she is. People swim in pools from the stream, so I warned Jay not too for the time being and told him to tell others. I know one neighbor removed her garden from the soil and moved it away from the stream just in case it got down to hers.

I'm unsure of what I should do next. I don't think I live in a two party consent state for video recording as it doesn't list it as one on the pdf I found. I might crosspost this into legal advice just in case (I do already have a lawyer, but it might be useful hearing free opinions from the internet).

Edit: I forgot to say that I had water testing sticks arriving tomorrow.

TLDR: Crazy neighbor steals hot spring water and pours chemicals into communal stream, poisoning my garden

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Get a lawyer, the police, anyone! I'm not a legal expert but if you can prove CNB (crazy neighbor bitch) has been doing all these things you could probably take her to court or the police could end up taking her to jail!

> **OOP:** I already have a lawyer, but haven’t gotten around to talking to her about this yet

**Commenter 2:** Take a water sample and call the police. That's a criminal act. Possibly a terroristic act. (poisoning a community water source).

> **OOP:** Nobody drinks out of it as the stream is a small fork off of a moderately sized gross creek. Would it still count as a community water source?

[Update: The test results](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/qwJA1sdMWb): **May 10, 2025 (four hours later)**

I'm doing this since so many people used the update me bot (I was confused what it was so I searched it up) The original post ([Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1kjm7nx/my_crazy_neighbor_poisoned_my_creek_and_stole/)) will keep having the updates edited to the end, and this is just for people who used the updateme bot. This will have all the updates.

**Update 1:** Jay offered to use a large drum in his garage to temporarily remove the water from the stream and seeing your comments, I’m taking him up on his deal. All the neighbors down the street that I’ve talked to so far (two besides Jay) agreed. One who has two sons said that they might block off the start of the stream. It is a small outlet of a moderately sized creek. It will probably be blocked off not that hard. Jay said that he can probably get the drum in place by tonight as his dad can help. Jay also has a sweet dog and definitely wants to protect it. I am going to remove my plants from the soil nearby the stream. Also, for reference in size of the stream, it’s about 1-2 feet across. Truly just a stream. There’s lots of obstacles and things that would probably filter out, but we definitely still have to be safe. I’ll update later tonight or tomorrow.

**Update 2:** Big news! The nice neighbors’ kids dammed up the stream at where it starts. It’s a couple pieces of wood, a branch or two, and a lot of small rocks. There’s still a tiny bit of water flowing, but it’s absorbed by the soil higher up before CN. Jay got the drum out, but we turned out not to need it. There’s water still in the pools in his backyard and we plan to do a water test. Apparently pH tests are sold in a store just 10 mins away, so I will head there as soon as I finish this post.

**Update 3:** Jays getting the pH test and an oxygen level test, but I don’t know how oxygen levels would play into it. I’ll look at responses and figure out what to do next. I will call authorities soon.

**Update 4:** The water test: pH came lower than the creek water before CN’s house (a full .9 lower). Nitrates a bit higher, Dissolved Oxygen significantly lower. That’s the only real changes in between the two tests. I wonder if she just poured a lot of vinegar. I think herbicides do change pH, but .9 is quite a bit I think.

&nbsp;

[Update: Cops pick up crazy neighbor](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/MJJoQOjH5y): **May 11, 2025 (next day)**

See my original post (original post will have updates. This is for people using updateme and following)

Big update! The makeshift dam broke and water has been flowing down, but it’s been slow. CN complained to a neighbor up the street that she’s on speaking terms with about me being a major asshole for not letting her kids use my hot spring tub. She let it slip that she poured vinegar in the stream as “justice”. The neighbor was also shown the contract for the pipes and she said that she didn’t even have it signed by me. She and her lawyer had signed it, but without any signature space for me. I thought that she forged my signature, but she didn’t have any agreement (fraudulent or otherwise) on my side whatsoever. The neighbor similarly dislikes her, but their kids are friends, so she has to talk to CN. I sent all the info to a local environmental charity that has contacts within environmental protection agencies. They usually deal with lakes and dumping, so this was in what they deal with regularly.

The police were outside CN’s house a couple hours ago and took her to the station. CN is back at her house, now yelling over the fence profanities while I’m having a coffee. I don’t know if they arrested her and she payed bail or that she just was taken in for questioning or something. I know her brother in law works at the police station, but I wouldn’t doubt that her family members have a strained relationship with her. I hope that she’s stuck with a giant fine and/or jail time. CN’s lawyer still hasn’t served me regarding the pipes, and my lawyer is saying that CN has no case whatsoever. I’ll update as soon as anything interesting comes up.

I also don't why on the first post of this update, it didn't contain the update lol

**Update 6:** My power just went out in most of my house. I think CN just flipped the breakers to annoy me. Going outside ASAP

**Update 7:** CN indeed did flip the breakers. As far as I know, the security camera has an internal battery for some time after it’s disconnected from the power so I don’t have to worry about her doing anything.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter:** She must have dumped HELLA vinegar to shift all that water almost a full point down. Are we sure it was household vinegar and not the type that's used as an herbicide?

> **OOP:** The pools in Jay’s yard I think had the water go out and the acidic water stream down into it. When I looked, it looked like she was pouring Costco size jugs of it, but I didn’t know it was vinegar at the time. I guess it could have been a different type.

**Can OOP sue CN for trespassing?**

> **OOP:** I don't think you can sue someone for trespassing... I got a police officer to tell her that she wasn't allowed on my property, so I guess that might answer your question.

While the government does its thing against my neighbor, I would like to do the most legal annoying thing to do. Currently, I'm thinking about removing the piping and seperating the original cost. I think I will send every piece individually through a local copy/print/delivery shop. I know the owner and I think he would think it would be hilarious and agree to it.

The plan (please help with it):

1. Remove the piping from the ground and separate *every* piece into small plastic baggies (and boxes).

2. Bring to copy/print/delivery shop

3. Plan deliveries of each package every period of time over a long time that require signage

4. Wait

5. Tip the copy/print/shop a hundred bucks

What do you think? What else could I do?

&nbsp;

[Update: the beginning of sweet revenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/4S0npgC6zf): **May 11, 2025 (almost three hours later)**

I called the owner of the copy/print/delivery shop and he agreed to what I said in the previous post. I removed all of the pipes from my yard and put them into bags. I didn’t have as much plastic bags and boxes as I thought so I’m paying extra for the owner of the copy shop to supply them. He just delivered the first one to CN (I watched from the street) and CN’s husband answered. He shouted for CN and she came up. I didn’t hear any of the discussion, but she signed delivery sheet, took the package (of a single small corner pipe piece), and stormed into her house. She went up to the 2nd story window and proceeded to glare at me since, still glaring as I sit on my couch while writing this. Working from home will be so nice for watching this.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Why did you not sue HER for tearing up your lawn? Lil miss Sue Happy needs a taste of her own medicine.

> **OOP:** The pipes weren’t buried (much) and there isn’t much lawn. Mostly woodchips and dirt and some native grasses

&nbsp;

[Update: Crazy Neighbor's weak jabs at me](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/OX0lVXVnCE): **May 11, 2025 (four hours later)**

Since my last post, there has been one more pipe delivery to CN and she is *pissed*. She stormed over to my house (after signing the delivery which I thought she would stop doing) and banged on the door. I started recording my front door and opened the door (I'm not dumb enough to let her in). CN starts shrieking about how I'm awful and that I had to keep the pipes installed as it was *her* property and that *we* had a contract. When I told her that the contract wasn't legal at all, she starts screaming at me. I stepped inside for a second and called the police with the door closed. CN continues banging on my door. I don't open until a police car comes down the street.

I tell the police that I don't want her ever to be on my property and that she is tresspassing. They relay that to her, and she takes up a hurt old lady act (for reference, she is in her 40s). CN tells them that my hot tub burned her youngest child and that I was luring kids in. I showed the police the camera footage and they asked her to come to the station with them. I'm assuming that she made some fake report, but I guess that will be another charge of lying to a police officer. I think that the officer (not CN's brother in law) believed me and saw that she was in fact a CN.

I saw CN get back into her house and once again went up to the top window, staring. I closed the blinds. I thought she would stop (honestly it doesn't bother me), but to my surprise, she crosses the street to the side of the hill (theres a slope on the other side of the street from the houses. There's more houses up the slope) and stares through my front window. I don't have blinds for that one and was about to head to a different room when I see her trip backwards (theres a small ditch for runoff) and land on her butt. CN lets out a ungodly shriek (it wasn't that loud, but I'd like to say it was) as she storms back into her house.

I feel at this point, with all of the stuff from my lawyer, from reddit, and neighbors saying that I am completely in the right and that CN is insane has made this more into entertainment than a scary situation for me. I have multiple locks arriving in a couple days and a new security camera for the side yard. If you have any *legal* suggestions, please tell me. If there's anything I should be aware of, please tell me.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter:** I don't understand how this has gone on for so long without LE getting more involved. If you have a clear deed with property lines drawn it should be a cut and dry issue. Just because ""people did it before"" doesn't make it legal if you told them to stop. Which if you haven't done so yet (I can't remember from your OP) do it in writing and have her respond back in writing. Keep EVERYTHING. Get a restraining order. Call the police every time she breaks it.

Keep us posted. She does sound mentally unstable though. Have you spoken to her husband?

> **OOP:** Her husband isn’t willing to talk. When I first met him, he seemed fine, but kind of spineless. I think I will file a restraining order. 

&nbsp;

[Update: Pulling back and going forwards legally](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/hZ2daagGbf ) **May 12, 2025 (next day)**

I’ve been told that messing with CN is probably not going to help out legally, especially with a restraining order, so I just told the copy shop owner just to deliver it all at once. I don’t know if that’s happened yet, but I’m fine not being looking when I happens. I will file a restraining order today. I don’t know how it works, but I hope I can complete it today. No new news from CN except Jay saying that she looked really mad. I know this isn’t a big update, but it’s an update on the situation.

&nbsp;

[Update: Husband comes over to talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/IHUDGiHHgw): **May 13, 2025 (next day)**

This happened last night and I was too tired to update after it. CN's husband (I'll call him NH for neighbor husband) knocked on my door last night, alone. CN wasn't there, so I answered it. He then tells me that CN is ""going through some things right now"" and some other stuff. He then asks me if I could ""let sleeping dogs lie. She did some stuff wrong, but she's a really great person"". I told him that I would consider it. I'm not, but I didn't want to be in that conversation. I honestly thought that he would apologize about it, but making excuses like that is so pathetic. According to many of my neighbors, CN's been like this for years. I think he's trying to cover themselves from the bomb they just planted. That's all. New updates probably coming soon.

&nbsp;

[Update: Some resolution (but not in the way you think)](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/mUVeWilBwq): **May 14, 2025 (next day)**

I was typing this out earlier, but it didn’t save as a draft so I will paraphrase it instead of writing it all out like earlier.

I went out to get my mail and I noticed CN rush out of her house onto her porch to watch me. I take the mail and head inside. Through the endless sea of junk mail, there was a wedding invitation. Nobody I know remotely nearby is getting married and I didn’t recognize the names or the faces. On the back was a handwritten letter thanking me for volunteering my house for the bachelorette party and inviting me to wedding at a local venue.

1) Definitely did NOT invite anyone to use my property for a party

2) My backyard isn’t the biggest for a party

3) I don’t know who these people are

I took a picture of the front and the back and then went and made a copy of the invitation and cut it to the right size. I then took the copy and walked in front of CN’s house (in the street). She is looking from the door. I then light the copy on fire (safely). She runs out and starts yelling at me. I am not entirely listening as I had an earbud in my left ear listening to a podcast (I listen to podcasts while doing my routines and hadn’t bothered to take it out) and at one point, I heard the groom’s name. Clearly she was behind it (I knew before, this just solidified the fact). I called her husband and told him that I was not hosting the bachelorette party and to leave me alone. He asks which one. I told him the names of the bride and groom. He is audibly surprised. He then tells me that the groom is CN’s son from a teenage pregnancy (not with him). He then said that he would talk to CN about it, calling it an accident.

I find the name of the dad of the groom and call him. He sounded super genuinely grateful when I told him who I was. I asked him about CN and he said that she had left the baby with him and when he had sued for child support, the judge said that it was his poor choices that led to the baby and he was responsible for it, without child support. I told him the situation, and he sounded defeated. Apparently, the groom had been quick to forgive his absent mother (CN) and had invited her against the dad’s wishes. He said that he would tell the groom and the bride about the situation.

I then had a thought that would be the absolute perfect revenge: I offered to host the party for free with 2 rules

1) They don’t damage anything and clean everything up

2) CN is blocked at the door of the wedding despite her invitation

3) My invite to the wedding still stands.

He said he would discuss it with the bride and groom. Even if he says no, it’s worth a try.

I just realized I typed it all up in detail despite what I said at the beginning. I will probably get the news in the next couple days.

&nbsp;

[Update: It was worth a try](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/Nf3C0OGEBm): **May 15, 2025 (next day)** 

I will call the groom's dad GD and groom and bride G and B

I was looking over some comments just before posting this and realized I don't want to be screwed over, so I am staying back. 

Also, GD gave me a call *extremely* late last night and told me that G wanted to meet his mom (CN) at the wedding. B was supportive, thinking it would be an extremely wholesome wedding. GD said that he would try to find another location for the party, but that it would be hard this late as B had a large bridesmaids group. GD is going to help CN with preparing for the wedding at his son's request, even though he thinks it might be a disaster. 

  My plants that are near the stream look scorched as if they were in a fire. (I'm talking about the plants that are next and around the stream, not in my garden.

I think the next steps are through legal means and not through petty actions.

I will keep you all updated.

&nbsp;

[Update: Piecing parts together](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/Kf3YW51zje): **May 15, 2025 (six hours later)**

CN had been trying to gain access to the hot spring for as long as she's known of it. She had tried lawsuits, land disputes, and other legal and legally dubious means to get it. When she heard of her son becoming married, she thought that she could have a good attempt at gaining access to the hot spring.

CN had initially offered to use her house for a price for the bridesmaids party, but since it didn't have anything good for a party, B had declined. She couldn't find another place though, but still didn't want CN's house. CN had then had the bright idea to tell the B and G that she had had a *natural, healing, and amazing* hot spring in her yard and B said yes. 

This is when CN tries the whole piping the hot spring to her yard. She obviously doesn't get far into that plan. After I dismantle all the piping, she volunteers my house and backyard for the party.

I think that the stream pollution was lashing out because she was mad before she volunteered my house.

No updates besides what I've pieced together from assorted sources.

&nbsp;

[Update: Revenge is back in action, without me needing to participate](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/WoyeHkiRct): **May 15, 2025 (seven hours later)**
  
GD called me about 10 mins ago. I was going to post the update right away, but I was reading some of the comments.

This is what he said, and asked if my offer about hosting the bridesmaids party was still standing (this is heavily paraphrased to be readable, but all the main points and events are there).

GD met up with CN to talk to her about the wedding, mostly setting boundaries. He went to her house (with his phone recording just in case anything happened, knowing the history of CN). 

GD is talking to CN very formally, as much straight facts as possible when he glances through a cracked open door into her bedroom. I don't remember the word he used to describe it (it was a very good way to say it), but kind of out of the corner of your vision when you're avoiding eye contact. GD sees multiple white dresses laying on CN's bed. They are fancy dresses. Not quite wedding dresses, but definitely close. GD can't stop staring at it. He then asks CN about what she's wearing to the wedding, and CN says that she has a couple dresses picked out.

He connects the dots and subtly leaves the conversation, calls B and G and tells them what he saw. He then gives G some of CN's history. B then asks if they can do the house with the hot spring then.

GD tells me that he knows that I don't like CN and that I wouldn't be at the wedding, but that the rest of the deal would stand. I told him sure, but not to let CN know about it, just letting herself think that I got pushed around by him into hosting.

I know that the agencies I contacted about her pouring vinegar into the creek have been investigating, so even though it likely wouldn't, I hope it all falls out on the day of the wedding

&nbsp;

[Update: CN Angry](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/2UBoowojed): **May 17, 2025 (two days later)**

I’ve been asked for an update. There has not been much crazy neighbor activity over the time that I haven’t updated. I think she installed a step stool on her side of the fence as she’s been looking evil eying me whenever I’m in the hot tub. The weddings coming up next weekend, so I’m interested in what’s going to happen. Not much has happened besides that.

&nbsp;

[Update: Really funny mini-revenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/AY79UY3yJF): **May 20, 2025 (three days later)** 

Ok, I’ve been told to skinny dip in the hot spring. I’m not doing that. I am not socially ok enough for my neighbor to see, even if it’s to get revenge. I do know some people who are.

This happened yesterday around 1, just for reference. I tell some friends who are comfortable in their own bodies that they could hang out in the hot tub and I’m not going to be there, so they could do whatever. I more asked them to do it after I gave a little bit of backstory of the neighbor. They happily agreed and they came around 1. I left for a nice long lunch when they came and I told them to call me if anything happened. I also turned off the back security camera just to not be weird. Not 30 minutes later do the COPS call me asking if I was ok with the people in my backyard. CN had called the cops for a trespassing (hypocrite) and they had arrived and talked to my friends. They had my number and they called me. I told them that I invited them over and the cops left. I didn’t get a call this time, but the police were called again for my friends “exposing themselves to children”. The police knew that they were in a private backyard, but still came and pretty much left almost immediately after (it was the same officers I think). That’s all. I don’t think I’m going to do anything until the wedding. Thank you for the astounding amounts of comments, it’s absolutely insane.

&nbsp;

[Update: Creek modifications](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/VryABURYgM): **May 20, 2025 (three hours later)**

My neighbor 2 houses down just came up to me and asked if I would allow the stream to be changed in my yard (Jay already said yes). There’s a landscaping company that’s going to be installing limestone along the creek for acid neutralization or something like that. My neighbor 2 houses down does have a garden similar to mine and I guess that’s why. Not a big update. I said yes. I hope this can prevent future acid attacks

Not a big update. I said yes. I hope this can prevent future acid attacks

&nbsp;

[Update: The Wedding](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/p0pwrZpxfe): **May 25, 2025 (five days later)**

I haven’t updated in a while even though some stuff is happened just so I could save it for this giant update. I am so shocked by what happened and I guess I should have listened to some advice about being safe. Also, I phrased the update about the card wrong as the bridesmaids party was last night and the wedding is today (the ceremony just finished just a couple minutes ago and I got the news of what happened by a mutual friend who went to the wedding (I didn’t know he was a mutual friend or going to the wedding. I told him about the situation a while ago and he decided to let me know).

Friday: CN kept looking over the fence. I would have turned on sprinklers, but I don’t have any because I don’t really have grass in my backyard. Later in the day, a police car pulled into CN’s driveway and a bit after, it left. CN’s “revenge” of staring at me continued a lot more after that. I don’t understand why she wastes her time doing it. It doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable.

Saturday: Some people knocked on my door mid day asking if I could let them into the backyard to set up for the bridal party. I called GD and he said it was the right people (just to be safe). They set up some surprisingly expensive and nice decorations and furniture in the yard (not in a destructive way). People come in and out while setting up and the backyard looks amazing. CN continuously peered over the fence for a good amount of time, but I didn’t care. Around 6, B and all the bridesmaids (I’ll do M for bridesmaids) (also about 20 bridesmaids there). I stayed inside mostly, but they occasionally asked me to come out and they drunkenly thanked me. I think the Ms were very wealthy as I received a little over 3K in “tips” from them as I occasionally brought out a carton of ice cream. Well worth it I think.

More to the events of the party. CN had a campfire in her backyard around 9, but there wasn’t really any wind, so the smoke just stayed in her yard. I think she tried to smoke us out, but maybe she was just having a little fire (I doubt it though). She then gets her hose to put out the fire and “accidentally” sprays water over the fence. Eventually, once the party winds down and they’re packing up, B hands a card signed by all of them thanking me for hosting with additional tips inside (about 2K). I was honestly stunned how nice they were.

Around 11, a very drunk CN bangs on my front door as I’m about to go to sleep. I don’t answer, but have the video on the doorbell camera. She leaves after a bit and I go to bed.

This morning: this is a secondhand account, so I won’t have all the details. CN comes to the wedding in her very white dress and demands to be let in, but the security denies her. She tries to push the security, but he isn’t fazed. People were watching, but my friend who was there had to go do something (I didn’t ask what). When he gets back, CN isn’t there.

What’s happening on my side: this is my account that is right after, but before I got the news about what happened. CN bangs on my door and tries the knob. Since I was getting groceries a bit before, I had accidentally left it unlocked. She comes into my house. I call the cops as soon as I see her open my door. I run upstairs while I give the info to the cops. CN screams at me and eventually slaps me in the face. I’m screaming at her to leave and she tries to slap me again. I grab her wrist and she screams. I basically drag her out the front door right as the police arrive. She is put in the back of the cop car and the police interview me. I tell them and they leave, then I get the news.

CN is not back. I honestly won’t argue with people about if this is true or not as what happened this morning doesn’t feel real even though I just lived through it.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Cops kept CN?

> **OOP:** Yeah, I think so

**Commenter 2:** OMG!! What did they charge her with? Breaking and Entering? Trespassing? Assault?

You have so much patience with this woman. Way more than I ever would. She is lucky it was your house and not someone else's. She knows she can get shot right? Or is she just that stupid?

Can you get a Restraining Oder against her? That way, she can't even talk to you. Order of Protection? I know you are not afraid of her, but I would do it just so I could get her repeatedly arrested.

I wish I had nerves of steel like you have. I am in my 50s and disabled and I don't have that kind of patience. I never had kids by choice, so my patience has always been pretty good.😄 But I definitely don't have the kind of patience you do with your neighbor.

Seriously, they could make a Lifetime movie about this whole story. I will be looking for it!!

Please keep us posted!! I am so invested in this story!! And Stay Safe!!

> **OOP:** I am pressing charges. I have been trying to be less patient

[\[Chapter 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1l14zwu/rebirth_protocol_bk1_ch_1_blood_memory/)

Friday morning greeted Nick with a pale, golden light—the kind of autumn sunrise that promised a perfect day. He decided to push his physical training further, testing the limits as Arlize’s muscle memory integrated with his own.

*Time to see if this reborn body can do what the memories suggest,* Nick thought with a mix of anticipation and skepticism. *Because doing calculus and statistics with borrowed knowledge is one thing—performing a triple backflip with a sword is quite another.*

The campus lay quiet as Nick jogged to the athletic complex, early enough that most students still slept. The facility opened at 6:00 AM, giving him the privacy he needed. The morning air carried a hint of autumn crispness as he moved across empty pathways.

The complex was nearly deserted, with just a sleepy-eyed student employee at the front desk who barely glanced up as Nick scanned his ID. He headed to the smaller training rooms, finding one with mats and equipment. Perfect.

Nick locked the door, ensuring privacy. He began with his standard regimen—push-ups, pull-ups, and core work—but today he added a bit of complexity. Each movement flowed with a warrior’s precision, his body recalling forms and stances from Arlize’s ancient battlefields.

“Alright, what can we do...” he murmured, moving to the center of the mat.

Nick closed his eyes, visualizing one of Arlize’s most challenging sequences—one requiring perfect balance, explosive power, and controlled precision. He’d never attempted anything similar before.

His body moved without hesitation, muscle and sinew responding to commands from another lifetime. A spinning kick transitioned into a low defensive stance, then an explosive series of strikes against an imaginary opponent. The movements felt natural yet advanced for someone with no formal martial training.

The air around him vibrated with potential energy, a subtle pressure building with each executed movement. Nick felt something awakening within him—a forgotten power responding to the physical catalyst.

As he finished his final movements, Nick noticed a faint blue glow emanating from his forearms, visible for just a moment. It had a crackling energy that left traces of ozone and raised the hairs on his skin. Where his hands moved, faint blue afterimages lingered, tracing perfect arcs through the empty room.

*That’s definitely not normal,* Nick thought, heart racing. *Pretty sure glowing blue arms weren’t covered in Freshman Orientation. Though it’d be a hell of an icebreaker: ‘Hi, I’m Nick, and sometimes I glow like a budget sci-fi prop.’*

The more he focused, the stronger the sensation grew. The blue energy coursed through him, perfectly matching the mana circuits Arlize had mastered. It wasn’t just raw power—it was an intricate system responding to his intent, enhancing his movements and sharpening his senses. Suddenly, the training room’s scents intensified—rubber mats, harsh cleaning chemicals, his own sweat—while sounds separated into distinct layers he could isolate and focus on.

The sight triggered something deep within him—

*The battlefield stretched before him, littered with the fallen. Rain turned earth to mud as lightning split the sky. Arlize stood surrounded by seven elite guardsmen in black armor, their enchanted blades gleaming with menace. Each weapon hummed with suppression tech specifically designed to counteract a mana user.*

*""Surrender, Commander,” their leader called, voice distorted through his helm. “Even you cannot defeat us all.”*

*Arlize’s hands rose, palms up. The blue glow started as a faint shimmer, then enveloped his arms in crackling azure flame. The energy pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat, illuminating the rain-soaked battlefield. Raindrops sizzled and evaporated before touching the blue aura, creating a halo of steam around him.*

*""I am Arlize Dentragon,” he announced above the storm, each word trailing glowing blue mist. “I do not surrender.”*

*The men attacked in unison, a coordinated force that would have overwhelmed any ordinary mage warrior. But Arlize was far from ordinary. His movements blurred, blue energy extending like phantom blades from his limbs. Each strike delivered immense force, each defensive move created shields of solid light that hummed when struck.*

*In moments, six attackers lay incapacitated, their magical weapons shattered by Arlize’s raw energy. The leader, the last one standing, stared in disbelief.*

*“What magic is this?” he whispered.*

*Arlize’s eyes glowed azure. “Not magic,” he corrected. “Something far older.”*

Nick gasped, stumbling as the vision abruptly faded. He steadied himself against the wall he found himself pressed against, breathing heavily, the faint blue glow already fading from his hands. He glanced at the door; still locked. Good.

“Holy shit,” he whispered, flexing his fingers. The room temperature seemed to drop, while the air above his skin shimmered with heat.

He focused on his palm, trying to recreate the sensation. Nothing happened at first—then a spark, like controlled static, danced between his thumb and forefinger before vanishing.

*It’s not just Arlize’s memories,* Nick realized, exhilaration coursing through him. *The Arcadian System is real and somehow... compatible with this world’s technology.*

Every device in the room suddenly appeared different—the security camera, the digital clock, the fluorescent lights. With his enhanced perception, he saw it all—a layer of reality he’d never noticed before.

*I wonder what happens if I...*

Nick raised his hand toward the clock, focusing like Arlize had on the battlefield. For a moment, nothing happened—then the display flickered, numbers jumping one minute ahead.

A wild laugh escaped him, part nervousness, part triumph. *If Matt and Sarah think they’re dealing with the same old Nick, they’re in for a surprise.*

Sweating, he pushed harder, testing both Arlize’s combat training and his own endurance. His body needed to become as sharp as his mind. Arlize’s power both exhilarated and terrified him.

He moved to another exercise, channeling mana through his muscles. The sensation was extraordinary—every fiber supercharged, movements amplified. Weights felt lighter, his reactions sharper. The mana optimized his body at a cellular level.

*This is how Arlize fought for days without rest,* Nick realized. *The Arcadian System removes physical limitations.*

He concentrated on a heavy weight he’d never managed before. Blue circuit-like patterns traced his muscles, guiding energy flow. The weight rose smoothly, feeling half as heavy as it should.

Afterward, his muscles burned pleasantly, but he wasn’t nearly as fatigued as expected. Recovery times that once took days now required mere hours. Another perk of his new existence.

Mana actively repaired his muscle micro-tears, accelerating healing. Tomorrow’s soreness was already fading, replaced by a warm glow radiating from his core. It felt like having an internal medical system, constantly optimizing his physical condition.

Nick examined his transformed muscles in the mirror, striking power poses. He could already see the gains reshaping his body.

*So cool!*

Leaving the room, Nick showered in the gym's locker room, his mind shifting to the day's objectives while still processing the vision's implications. The Business Leaders Association had a happy hour that evening—an event he'd once dismissed but now recognized as crucial for networking with experienced upperclassmen.

Nick kept Fridays free of classes, so after showering and changing, he headed to the campus café for a protein-rich breakfast. At 8:15 AM, the café was nearly empty, just a few bleary-eyed students and professors reviewing notes over coffee.

The café enveloped his senses with rich coffee aromas and toasting bread, underscored by hints of cinnamon and vanilla from specialty drinks. Soft jazz played, creating an atmospheric backdrop to the occasional hiss of the espresso machine. Morning light streamed through windows, casting golden rectangles across the floors.

*The old Nick would still be in bed,* he thought with grim amusement. *It's amazing how a murder threat can improve your morning routine.*

Nick chose a high-protein meal—eggs, turkey bacon, and whole grain toast—fuel for recovery after training. While waiting for his order, he noticed faint energy signatures emanating from the café's kitchen equipment. Each operated on distinct frequencies, and he could perceive the flow of electricity through them.

*I wonder if I could optimize that coffee machine to make a decent brew,* he mused, then caught himself. *Focus, Nick. You're not here to become a mana-powered barista.*

As he ate, he pulled out his tablet and reviewed his weekly progress notes. The quiet morning provided the perfect setting for his next priority: intelligence gathering.

Nick ran his fingers along the tablet's edge, channeling mana into its circuitry. The device responded instantly, boosting speed, closing background apps, strengthening security protocols, and improving battery efficiency by 30%.

He created a secure document detailing his observations of the military-postured student from Statistics class—physical description, behavior patterns, known affiliations—all categorized with Arlize's meticulous precision.

Next, he compiled information on Jordan, noting behavioral inconsistencies—the casual demeanor that occasionally slipped to reveal something more calculated underneath. Cross-referencing Jordan's background with public records confirmed everything appeared legitimate.

By 9:30, Nick moved to the engineering building, ostensibly to use their computer lab but really to observe Maggie Zhang, an engineering prodigy. He carefully noted her schedule, work habits, and social connections for future reference.

Watching Maggie, Nick marveled at his evolution. Old Nick would have blundered with clumsy conversation. New Nick valued reconnaissance, knowing whom he was dealing with before contact.

*Knowing when not to act is as important as knowing when to strike,* he recalled from Arlize's battlefield principles, which applied surprisingly well to college dynamics.

The next two hours were dedicated to campus reconnaissance. Nick visited the business school's research center, inquiring about market analysis databases for his Coleman Fellowship application. He toured the entrepreneurship lab, noting visiting speakers for potential connections.

Most importantly, he mapped key faculty and staff offices in the administrative building—Professor Williams's suite, Dean Harrison's office, and the financial aid department—all becoming part of his mental map of the university's power structure.

Every location underwent Arlize's tactical assessment: entry points, security measures, staff routines, and potential surveillance. Not for anything illicit, but because information was power, and understanding the landscape was essential to success.

By noon, Nick secured his spot on the library's third floor—quiet, with clear sightlines to both entrances and minimal foot traffic. He arranged his materials like a commander at a war table.

First, the Coleman Fellowship application. Nick reviewed the requirements, strategizing: his research proposal needed to be innovative but not suspiciously brilliant. Impressive yet not so revolutionary as to raise questions.

He drafted topics, weighing each against the committee's interests. Dean Harrison had published on market volatility. Professor Kelley focused on consumer behavior in digital environments. The Callahan Industries rep likely cared about corporate growth strategies, given their aggressive expansion.

A memory surfaced—last year's fellowship winner researched sustainable supply chains, aligning with Callahan's recent initiatives. *Information asymmetry is power,* Nick reminded himself, noting ""predictive market analysis in sustainable technologies"" as his leading proposal. It would interest all committee members and allow him to research sectors with known future developments.

As he worked, Nick sensed a familiar presence. He didn't need to look up to recognize the deliberate footfalls and jasmine perfume that triggered an involuntary tightness in his chest—a reaction he needed to control.

""Didn't expect to find you here on a Friday afternoon,"" Sarah said, sliding into the chair across from him. ""Most freshmen are already pre-gaming for tonight.""

Nick looked up, maintaining a neutral expression despite the jolt of aversion. ""Just finishing some work.""

Sarah’s eyes scanned his materials, lingering on the Coleman Fellowship application. The light caught the highlights in her dark hair, a detail he once found captivating but now noted clinically as part of her carefully cultivated appearance.

“Ambitious,” she remarked, one eyebrow rising. “That’s for upperclassmen.”

“Professor Williams suggested I apply,” Nick replied, focusing on his notes instead of her surprise.

“Williams suggested it?” Something flashed across Sarah’s face—annoyance or recalculation. “Interesting. Matt’s preparing his application too.”

*Of course he is,* Nick thought, recalling how Matt had casually mentioned winning the fellowship during junior year—like it was insignificant, not a calculated move. *Probably had daddy make a call before writing.*

“Good for him,” Nick said neutrally, continuing to write.

Sarah leaned in, her designer jasmine-vanilla perfume wafting across the table. A scent that once intoxicated him now sickened him.

“So you’re not coming tonight?” she asked, with a hint of challenge. “It’s the social event of the semester. Everyone who matters will be there.”

*Everyone who matters,* Nick thought, suppressing a smile. *Funny how that list perfectly aligns with Matt’s circle.*

Nick set down his pen and met her gaze. “I’ve got prior commitments.”

“With who?” Sarah pressed, disbelief coloring her voice. “You’ve barely talked to anyone except that Jordan guy from your dorm.”

*She’s been tracking my interactions,* Nick realized. *Surveilling me. Why?*

“The Business Leaders Association,” Nick replied, smiling as surprise registered on her face. “We’re meeting up before I work on this application.”

Sarah recovered quickly, shifting to casual interest. “Tyler Davidson’s group? Didn’t know you’d connected with them.”

Her recovery was impressive, but Nick caught the micro-expressions—the tightening around her eyes, increased blinking, and subtle shift in breathing. All telltale signs of someone recalculating.

“Just expanding my network,” Nick said casually, stacking his papers. “Did you need something, Sarah? I’m trying to focus.”

Sarah’s facade wavered, irritation slipping through her charm, but she quickly recovered, standing gracefully.

“Just checking in,” she said lightly. “Matt and I miss you. When you’re ready to hang out, the invitation’s open.”

Nick watched her leave, noting the tension in her shoulders. Sarah wasn’t used to being dismissed, especially by someone she once controlled.

*That’s right, Sarah. The puppy you thought would follow you just grew fangs.*

Nick returned to his fellowship outline, crafting a research proposal on predictive modeling for sustainable tech markets. It was sophisticated enough to stand out without raising questions about a freshman’s unusual capabilities.

Next, he mapped investment opportunities, using Arlize’s memory techniques to create a timeline of market events from his past life, coded in his personal shorthand.

Helios Pharmaceuticals’ breakthrough in six weeks was just the beginning. He documented other key opportunities:

* Maxwell Technologies’ battery innovation (3 months)
* Riverbend Software’s security vulnerability (5 months)
* Nexus Virtual Technologies’ neural interface patent (18 months)
* Global semiconductor shortage (10 months)

Each event could multiply his investment, building the financial foundation he needed for independence.

*Financial independence is the first step toward true freedom,* Nick thought, remembering his past feelings of entrapment. *That won’t happen again.*

He encrypted the document with multiple security layers, including a mana-enhanced protocol to alert him to any intrusions. It wasn’t paranoia if they were really watching.

As the library emptied, Nick packed up and headed to his dorm to prepare for the BLA happy hour. He changed into dark jeans and a crisp button-down shirt—professional but not trying too hard—and made his way to McAlary Brews, the casual bar where the group was meeting.

Before leaving, Nick paused at the mirror, subtly using mana to enhance his appearance—not changing his features, but optimizing how light played across them. Arlize had developed this technique for diplomatic missions; it wasn’t vanity but strategy. Humans instinctively responded to visual cues, and this enhancement made him appear more confident and trustworthy.

*All warfare is based on deception,* he reminded himself, channeling Sun Tzu with a grim smile. *And networking is just warfare with better drinks.*

McAlary Brews buzzed with Friday energy, its copper fixtures and wood paneling creating a relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere. The bar smelled of hops and cedar, with sweet-smoky notes of the day’s bourbon-glazed appetizer. Classic rock played at the perfect volume for conversation. Students filled most tables, their laughter and discussions weaving a rhythmic tapestry of sound.

Nick spotted Tyler Davidson at a large corner booth, surrounded by about eight students. He approached confidently, nodding as Tyler looked up.

""Nick Valiente,"" Tyler called, gesturing to an empty spot. ""Glad you could make it. We were just discussing Professor Williams' latest corporate valuation model.""

Nick slid in, noting the group—mostly juniors and seniors, judging by their confident postures and easy familiarity with each other.

""Nick's the freshman I mentioned,"" Tyler said. ""The one who knew about the mentorship program before I even brought it up.""

A senior with close-cropped hair extended his hand. ""James Mercer, Finance. How'd you know about the mentorship program? Most freshmen are still figuring out where the library is.""

""I believe in thorough research,"" Nick replied modestly, accepting the handshake. ""The program's too valuable to miss just because of a lack of information.""

""Smart,"" said a Black woman to his left, her crisp business attire suggesting she'd just come from an internship. ""Isis Adebo, third-year Marketing and Data Analytics double major. I wish I'd been that strategic as a freshman.""

The conversation flowed easily, with Nick carefully balancing knowledge and deference to the upperclassmen's experience. He collected valuable insights about professors' grading tendencies, corporate recruitment strategies, and business school hierarchies—information that would have taken months to gather on his own.

""So, Valiente,"" said Marcus, a senior, after their second round of drinks, ""Tyler tells us you're applying for the Coleman Fellowship already. Bold move.""

Nick sensed genuine curiosity behind the comment. ""Professor Williams suggested it. I figure the worst they can say is wait until next year.""

""Williams actually suggested it?"" Alexa raised an eyebrow. ""He's notoriously selective.""

""What's your proposal focus?"" asked James, leaning in with interest.

Nick shared an edited version of his research, sparking genuine interest around the table.

""That's... really insightful,"" Marcus admitted, clearly impressed. ""Especially the predictive modeling for emerging sustainability technologies. Callahan Industries is exploring that exact area.""

""Is it?"" Nick asked, feigning surprise. ""Good to know.""

Alexa explained, ""Their new VP of Strategy gave a talk last semester about their five-year sustainability initiatives. They're working to position themselves ahead of upcoming regulatory changes.""

""Why?"" Nick asked, sensing an opportunity for more intel.

James lowered his voice. ""Word is, Matthew Callahan Sr. has an inside track with regulatory committees. They pivot before major policy shifts happen.""

*Insider trading on an institutional scale,* Nick thought. *No wonder Matt's family has that mansion and all those vacation homes.*

Nick filed this information away, connecting Matt's family to potential insider trading—possibly linked to emerging neural interface technology. This could be leverage to bring them down later.

The conversation drifted to campus social life, with Tyler mentioning the Alpha Phi party happening that night.

""We usually head over after happy hour,"" Tyler said. ""You're welcome to join us, Nick.""

Nick checked his watch, feigning disappointment. ""I need to head back soon. Early commitment tomorrow.""

""On a Saturday?"" Marcus laughed. ""Man, you really are dedicated.""

""Just trying to make the most of this college opportunity,"" Nick replied with a slight smile. ""This was great. Thanks for the invite.""

""You should come to our Tuesday meetings,"" Alexa suggested. ""We have alumni speakers and invaluable networking.""

""I'll be there,"" Nick promised, feeling satisfied he'd struck the serious yet personable tone he wanted.

As they headed toward the Alpha Phi house, Nick exchanged contact info with several members, solidifying their connections. *Strategic social capital, building steadily.*

The walk back to campus gave Nick time to process what he'd learned. The BLA offered potential allies, mentors, and information sources—resources he'd overlooked before. Plus, the intel about Callahan Industries' advance knowledge of regulatory changes added another piece to the puzzle he was assembling.

He paused at a campus intersection, extending his mana-enhanced awareness to scan for observers. Nothing obvious, but a faint electromagnetic anomaly near the library's west entrance caught his attention—someone using high-powered communication equipment where it shouldn't be.

James's comment about Matthew Callahan Sr.'s ""inside track"" lingered in his mind. He headed to the library, still open for another hour. Something about Callahan Industries needed verification—something from his past that now seemed important.

Approaching the library, Nick noticed the anomaly shifting, becoming more focused—as if someone had just pointed it directly at him. He casually adjusted his path, pretending to check his phone while scanning with his enhanced senses.

*Surveillance equipment,* he realized with a jolt. *Someone's tracking me.*

He couldn't determine who was behind it—Matt or someone else—but attracting attention this quickly was both concerning and validating.

In the library’s computer lab, Nick logged into a terminal to research Callahan Industries’ regulatory activities over the past five years. The company’s public profile displayed a pristine record of compliance and innovation, with press releases showcasing their environmental initiatives and ethical business practices.

Nick dug deeper into their neural interface investments, a technology that had revolutionized gaming in his previous timeline but now hit unusual obstacles. Patent links returned errors, news articles showed “Page Not Found,” and academic papers on early technology by Callahan subsidiaries were either redacted or completely removed.

Most disturbing were the gaps he found in his own memory. Nick recalled the general story of Nexus Virtual Technologies’ breakthrough and Callahan Industries’ acquisition, but details like researchers’ names and timelines were frustratingly blurred, as if someone had selectively erased them.

*It’s like someone scrubbed my brain just like they’re scrubbing the internet,* Nick thought, chilled by the implications. *That would mean they know about my future memories...*

“They’re erasing information,” Nick murmured, scrolling through dead ends. This wasn’t normal corporate secrecy; it was active suppression, affecting even his future memories.

The implications froze him. If Callahan Industries could remove information so thoroughly, what else were they capable of? Could there be a connection between their technology and his unexplained rebirth with Arlize’s memories?

The library’s closing announcement interrupted his thoughts. Nick logged off, carefully erasing his browsing history. This wasn’t just about Matt and Sarah anymore. Something larger was unfolding, possibly explaining his second chance at life.

He left the library, taking an indirect route back to his dorm. The cool night air carried the scents of fresh-cut grass and distant cigarette smoke. Nick extended his senses, focusing on technological frequencies, and detected multiple signals converging on him—not random campus Wi-Fi, but directed, encrypted communications.

*They’re coordinating,* he realized, maintaining a casual pace while mentally mapping the signal sources. *Two... no, three positions triangulating my movements.*

As Nick approached his dorm, he spotted a familiar figure—the military-postured student from his Statistics class, standing near the entrance, seemingly engaged with his phone. The man glanced up as Nick approached, their eyes meeting briefly before he returned to his screen with practiced casualness.

*Not a coincidence,* Nick thought, Arlize’s tactical instincts buzzing. The man’s position provided a clear view of everyone entering or exiting, and his relaxed posture couldn’t hide the alertness in his eyes.

With enhanced perception, Nick detected subtle signs invisible to others—the man’s slightly elevated heart rate, controlled breathing of someone maintaining vigilance, and an earpiece in his right ear. Most telling was the faint electromagnetic signature from a wristwatch housing sophisticated communications tech.

*Military-grade surveillance on campus. Interesting choice for a statistics major.*

Nick entered the building, maintaining an unhurried pace while heightening his awareness. He climbed the stairs, mind racing through possibilities. Was the man watching him specifically? Jordan? Or someone else entirely?

*Funny how quickly I’ve gone from worrying about quizzes to military surveillance,* Nick thought with grim humor. *Talk about an accelerated curriculum.*

As he reached for his door key, Jordan’s door swung open suddenly, as if he’d been waiting for footsteps.

“Hey, man,” Jordan greeted with his usual casual smile, though Nick noticed his eyes were sharper than his tone suggested. “Just heading out?”

“Just got back, actually,” Nick replied, glancing past Jordan into his room.

The space was an eclectic mix—band posters, a guitar propped in the corner next to neatly folded clothes. The desk was organized with military precision, pens and notebooks at perfect right angles. Yet the bed was unmade, sheets tangled from restless sleep. The contrasting elements struck Nick as deliberately inconsistent—like a set designed to convey a specific impression.

Nick’s perception caught more discrepancies. The guitar strings lacked oil residue from regular playing; items on the nightstand had precise spacing like staged photography; a faint electromagnetic field emanated from an ordinary alarm clock concealing sophisticated recording equipment.

Most telling was the nearly imperceptible earpiece Jordan wore—identical to the one the military-postured student outside had been using. Not standard consumer tech, but advanced enough to make the NSA envious.

“Business club thing,” Nick nodded at Jordan’s jacket. “You headed to Alpha Phi?”

“Yeah, thought I’d check it out,” Jordan confirmed. “Figured you’d be there already.”

“Not my scene,” Nick shrugged. “I’ve got work on the Coleman fellowship application.”

“On a Friday night?” Jordan raised an eyebrow, amused yet admiring. “That’s dedication, man.”

“Just prioritizing,” Nick replied, echoing what he’d told Sarah earlier.

Jordan’s smile didn’t quite reach his eyes, and Nick noticed a subtle shift in his posture—a micro-adjustment suggesting he was receiving information through that earpiece.

""Well, I won't see you tomorrow—heading home for a family thing,"" Jordan said, adjusting his jacket. ""But we're still on for the Sunday study session, right?""

*Family thing. How convenient,* Nick thought. *Probably a briefing with whoever's running this surveillance operation.*

""Absolutely,"" Nick confirmed. ""Noon in the Undergraduate Library study rooms. I'll be there earlier, so just text me when you arrive.""

""Perfect. See you then,"" Jordan said, shutting his door and heading toward the stairs.

Nick entered his room, closing the door firmly. He stood motionless, extending his senses as Arlize would, searching for any signs his space had been disturbed. Everything appeared untouched, but something felt off.

*Trust your instincts,* Nick reminded himself. He meticulously checked the patterns he'd arranged his items in, the angle of his chair, the folding of his bedcovers. Nothing was visibly out of place, yet the faint scent of unfamiliar cologne lingered—so subtle anyone without Arlize's enhanced senses would dismiss it.

Someone had been in his room. They'd covered their tracks well—but not their scent.

Nick closed his eyes, focusing on the lingering molecules in the air. With enhanced perception, he could almost taste the cologne—an expensive sandalwood fragrance favored by executives. Not a student's choice, and certainly not campus security.

*Professional,* Nick thought. *Someone used to leaving no trace—but they didn't account for my abilities.*

Nick felt cold calculation replace what might have been panic. This was precisely why he kept sensitive materials on him or encrypted on his laptop. The intrusion confirmed his suspicion—he was being watched.

By whom? Jordan was the obvious suspect, given his behavior and his convenient placement across the hall. But who was Jordan working for? Matt's family? A security team? Someone else entirely?

Nick sat at his desk, opening his laptop to continue work on his Coleman application. He'd proceed as planned, giving no indication he'd detected the intrusion. Let them think their surveillance remained unnoticed while he gathered more information.

As he opened his computer, Nick ran his fingers along the casing, channeling mana into the device's security systems. The screen flickered as Arcadian energy integrated with the digital architecture, creating a hybrid defense impossible to breach with conventional hacking. It would log any intrusion attempts while appearing normal to outsiders.

*Let's see what they try next,* he thought, typing as if nothing were amiss.

With his Coleman application draft complete, Nick checked the time—almost midnight. His body craved rest, but his mind kept processing the day's revelations: the information on Callahan Industries, evidence of someone searching his room, and the military-postured student's surveillance.

Before surrendering to sleep, Nick decided to meditate, hoping to access more of Arlize's memories or abilities. The blue glow he'd glimpsed that morning demanded investigation.

He settled cross-legged on his bed, back straight, hands resting on his knees. Four counts in. Hold for seven. Out for eight. He focused inward, seeking Arlize's consciousness.

Nick actively searched for information about the strange blue glow, visualizing the color and concentrating on the sensation he'd felt during his exercises.

The dormitory faded as his consciousness turned inward, creating a mental landscape between dream and memory—a direct connection to knowledge.

A memory unfolded: *Arlize in a stone chamber beneath the palace, surrounded by runes. The warrior-mage's hands emitted a faint blue glow as they interacted with the chamber's circuit-like walls, amplifying the energy.*

*""Aether manifestation,"" Arlize's voice explained. ""The physical embodiment of magical potential, visible when properly channeled.""*

*The walls displayed diagrams and equations—blending mathematics and arcane symbols—showing how consciousness manipulates reality. The Arcadian System was a literal framework for this process.*

Nick felt a surge of understanding wash over him. This was knowledge transfer. Arlize practiced a technique for channeling magical energy, something taught to promising arcane students.

Guided by the memory, Nick focused on his hands, imagining energy flowing and concentrating in his palms. At first, nothing happened. Then, a faint blue glow appeared—barely visible, but undeniably real.

The energy responded to his intent, forming patterns that mirrored his thoughts. It wasn't just power but information encoded in light—the language of the Arcadian System. He realized magic was evolved technology resonating with this world's electronics.

Startled by the revelation, Nick lost his balance and toppled off his bed. The glow vanished as his concentration broke. Heart racing, he stared at his hands in disbelief.

This wasn't just muscle memory or heightened awareness. It was something impossible—energy manifesting through thought. Magic, in a world where it shouldn't exist.

""What the hell am I becoming?"" Nick whispered.

Arlize's memory offered no answer, but Nick sensed this was just the beginning. Their connection was growing stronger. The implications were both thrilling and terrifying.

As he lay down to sleep, Nick's mind raced. If he could access Arlize's magical abilities, the advantage would be immense. But this raised unsettling questions about his identity and rebirth.

Was he still Nick Valiente merely carrying Arlize's memories? Or was he becoming something new—a fusion of two souls?

*Identity crisis later,* he thought. *Focus on survival and gathering power. Philosophy can wait.*

One thing remained certain: he would master this power. Control it. Bend it to his advantage.

As he drifted toward sleep, one of Arlize's memories surfaced—the warrior's determination to expose betrayal through methodically gathered evidence. A strategy Nick now intimately understood.

""Patience is the deadliest weapon,"" Arlize had said. ""A sword stroke can be blocked, but true justice cannot.""

Nick smiled grimly. *Let Matt, Sarah, and the others think they held the advantage. Their overconfidence would become their undoing.*

Just as consciousness began to fade, a vibration jolted him awake. Nick reached for his phone, blinking at the bright screen. An alert: 'Unauthorized access attempt detected on encrypted file: NK\_TS\_INV.dat.'",1,1748836754.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Nick's Wednesday started like the others—5:30 AM wake-up, workout, and preparation. As he did push-ups, a strange sensation rippled through his muscles. The fatigue he expected after intense training was noticeably reduced. His body was adapting quickly.

Another gift from Arlize? Nick wondered, finishing his set with unexpected ease. Or is this part of the mana integration?

His physical conditioning seemed to accelerate, muscle memory from another life merging seamlessly with his younger body. During the last rep, he glimpsed faint blue energy flowing through his muscles, strengthening them in real time.

After a shower, Nick dressed in a carefully chosen outfit—simple yet serious. Balance was key. In his past life, he'd swung between trying too hard and not caring at all. Now, every detail was calculated.

First impressions matter twice, he thought with grim amusement, adjusting his collar. At least I can fix my fashion mistakes this time.

The morning air was crisp as he crossed the campus quad to his first class—Biology. On Monday, the concepts had seemed clearer—Arlize's tactical mind grasping biological systems with surprising ease.

As Nick walked, he tested his enhanced perception, extending his senses beyond normal human limits. The campus looked fundamentally different—electromagnetic fields pulsing around power lines, the aura of living energy surrounding trees, even faint traces of where people had recently walked.

Most fascinating were the electronic devices. Focusing his mana-enhanced sight on phones and laptops, he observed energy patterns flowing through the circuitry, remarkably similar to the mana coursing through his own body.

The Arcadian System, he thought, recalling a term from his mana experiments. It's connected to modern technology, as if they share underlying principles.

Nick decided tonight he'd begin formal meditation to systematically access Arlize's memories and skills. Random knowledge flashes were useful, but deliberate control would prove far more valuable.

After Biology—where cellular structures eerily mirrored mana pathways—Nick grabbed a quick lunch and headed to Calculus. Near the Math building entrance, he spotted Matt leaning against a pillar, scrolling through his phone. Too practiced. Matt had deliberately arrived early, orchestrating this ""casual"" encounter.

Nick maintained his pace. Avoidance would reveal too much; eagerness would contradict the distance he'd been establishing. Balance in all things—one of Arlize's battlefield principles now serving a different war. ""Valiente,"" Matt called out, looking up with a smile that once seemed friendly but now felt calculated. ""Aren't you early for class?""

Nick kept a neutral expression, eyes steady. With enhanced perception, he noted Matt's subtle shoulder tension and elevated heart rate.

""Early's relative,"" he said evenly. ""Some prefer to be prepared.""

""Still haven't heard from Sarah,"" Matt observed, tone light but eyes watchful. Testing my reaction. Nick felt mana prickling with irritation and suppressed it.

""Been focused,"" Nick replied, shifting his backpack. ""Classes, clubs, settling in.""

Matt studied him, calculation in his eyes. ""Ryan said you seem... different. Like, completely different than high school.""

Nick met his gaze. ""College is a fresh start.""

""Is it, though?"" Matt stepped closer. ""People don't change overnight, Nick. Not really.""

The challenge lingered between them. In his past, Nick would have backpedaled, made a joke to ease tension, eager to stay in Matt's good graces.

That Nick was gone.

""Maybe they do when they see clearly for the first time,"" Nick replied, his voice steady, causing Matt's smile to falter.

The door opened as students began arriving. Matt glanced at the interruption, then back at Nick, almost ruefully.

""Whatever this new act is, it's entertaining,"" he said quietly. ""Just remember who your real friends are, Nick. College is bigger than Westridge. Easy to get lost without people who know you.""

The threat was clear: stay in your place. Remember the hierarchy.

""I know exactly who my real friends are,"" Nick replied, the double meaning clear only to him. ""See you around, Matt.""

As Nick walked past Matt, he felt a surge of mana responding to his emotions—a cold blue energy beneath his skin. He contained it, breathing as Arlize had taught him. The last thing he needed was a visible display of his abilities.

More practice needed, he noted, feeling Matt's gaze boring into his back. Mana responds to emotions—dangerous if left uncontrolled.

Another encounter navigated, another piece positioned. Matt's curiosity was piqued—he'd be watching closely. Good. Let him waste energy figuring out the change. Nick had more important things to focus on.

Calculus proceeded as before, though Nick moderated his performance. After talking with Jordan about people noticing his sudden academic prowess, he'd realized the need for a more measured approach. Excellent, yes, but not suspiciously perfect.

Nick noticed Jordan's absence—the first break in their ""friendship"" pattern. Another variable to track. When Professor Ellis called on him for a complex limit problem, Nick hesitated, then worked through it, inserting and correcting a minor error. A calculated performance—showing ability without perfection that might raise questions.

""Well done, Mr. Valiente,"" Professor Ellis nodded approvingly. ""A thoughtful approach.""

As Ellis turned back to the board, Nick noticed the professor's energy signature. Unlike most, whose auras appeared as indistinct halos to Nick's mana-enhanced perception, Ellis's was crystalline—ordered, structured, almost artificial.

Not natural, Nick realized. Like something's interfacing with him.

The observation was disturbing, but investigating further would reveal his own abilities. He filed it away for later analysis, another piece in the puzzle.

As class ended, Nick gathered his things, his eyes lingering on Jordan's empty seat—a small but noteworthy disruption to his pattern. A missed class, or something more? Nick filed the observation away.

After class, he stuck to his routine—study session, meal, then back to his room.

That's when Jordan appeared, knocking on his open door. ""Hey man,"" Jordan said, leaning against the doorframe. ""Sorry I missed class.""

Nick noted the shadows under Jordan's eyes and the tension in his posture. More telling was a faint electrical signature clinging to him—residual energy from sophisticated communications equipment. ""Everything okay?"" Nick asked, keeping his tone casual.

""Yeah, just some family stuff,"" Jordan replied, waving it off. ""Nothing major."" The explanation seemed reasonable, but Nick noticed how Jordan's eyes swept the room, lingering on Nick's laptop and the bulletin board with his disguised strategy notes.

""Got the notes if you need them,"" Nick offered, maintaining their ""friendship"" while watching for more anomalies.

Jordan's face lit up. ""Awesome. Professor Ellis moves fast.""

Nick handed over a sheet from his folder. ""I highlighted the parts for the second quiz.""

""Thanks, man."" Jordan glanced through the notes, relieved. ""Saves me from finding someone else.""

As Jordan studied, Nick observed him. The casual demeanor seemed deliberate now—like he had trained himself to appear relaxed.

""So,"" Jordan said, looking up. ""I saw you with Matt at the activities fair yesterday.""

The mention set off Nick's alarms. Jordan was tracking his interactions.

""Yeah,"" Nick replied neutrally. ""He mentioned some Alpha Phi party.""

Jordan's fingers tightened on the paper. ""You going?""

""Probably not,"" Nick said, watching for a reaction. ""Not my scene anymore.""

Using his enhanced perception, Nick detected a subtle shift in Jordan's bioelectrical field—a flash of surprise.

""Huh."" Jordan leaned casually. ""Thought Westridge folks were your crowd. You, Sarah, Matt—the whole golden circle.""

The term 'golden circle' caught Nick's attention. It was specific to Westridge's social hierarchy, not something an outsider would use.

""We went to the same high school,"" Nick said carefully. ""Doesn't make us a crowd.""

Jordan nodded a bit too quickly. ""Right, of course. Just heard some stories.""

""What kind of stories?"" Nick asked lightly despite the warning bells.

Jordan shrugged, handing back the notes. ""Just that you guys were tight. Matt the big man, Sarah the brilliant one, you the athletic one.""

The characterization was accurate but oddly specific. Nick filed it away, another piece in the puzzle of Jordan's unexpected appearance in his life.

""High school labels,"" Nick dismissed with a wave. ""Not interested in carrying them into college.""

""Smart,"" Jordan agreed, pushing off the wall. ""Hey, thanks for the notes. I owe you one.""

""No problem,"" Nick replied, watching Jordan cross the hall and close his door.

As Jordan's door clicked shut, Nick turned to his notes but couldn't focus. He needed to be cautious around Jordan—and maybe do some digging. The terminology Jordan used and his timely appearances were too suspicious to ignore.

Nick's heightened senses had detected something unusual about Jordan today—a faint trace of mana, as if he'd been near someone using it, not using it himself.

Curiouser and curiouser, Nick thought. Is Jordan a watcher for someone with mana abilities, or is he unknowingly carrying traces?

The implications unsettled him. If others with mana knowledge were at Westlake, the situation was far more complex than Nick had initially thought.

Nick sat cross-legged on his bed, back straight, hands on his knees. The position felt natural, though he couldn't recall meditating in his past life—perhaps another muscle memory from Arlize.

He closed his eyes, breathing steadily, focusing on the dual awareness since his rebirth. Nick Valiente and Arlize Dentragon—two lives, two memories, merged into one consciousness.

""Arlize,"" he thought, reaching inward. ""I need your knowledge.""

At first, nothing—just his thoughts in the darkness. Then, gradually, a sense of something else emerged—a presence, not separate but distinct. Like accessing another part of the same mind.

The sensation disoriented him. Not quite a voice, not quite a memory, but something in between. Knowledge unfolding, revealing itself.

A memory surfaced—Arlize in a stone chamber lit by flickering torches. An old man with silver-streaked hair sat across from him, eyes closed. ""The mind is a fortress,"" he said, his voice heavy with wisdom. ""But even the strongest fortress needs gates to communicate with the outside world.""

Arlize—perhaps in his early twenties—nodded. ""Master Elian, you speak of mental partitioning.""

""Indeed,"" the old man confirmed. ""Creating separate chambers within your consciousness to store knowledge, memories, and skills, accessible and secure as needed.""

Blue energy flowed from the master's fingertips, forming glowing symbols like circuit diagrams. The mana coalesced, then dissolved into mist that Arlize inhaled, the knowledge becoming part of him.

The memory shifted to Arlize practicing this technique—constructing mental barriers and pathways, organizing thoughts into categories to lock or unlock at will. A discipline he had honed over years.

Nick instinctively absorbed the technique, his mind adapting to Arlize's pattern. The process felt natural, as if he were prewired for this skill.

This is how I'll access what I need, Nick realized. Not just random memories, but deliberate retrieval of skills and knowledge.

He focused on a specific need—instantaneous sleep, the ability Arlize used to rest even in danger.

As he delved deeper, unexpected emotions flooded him. Arlize's feelings, vivid and raw: fierce loyalty to comrades, romantic passion that made him vulnerable to Lady Serenne, and the bitter taste of disillusionment when ideals crumbled before reality.

Nick gasped, nearly breaking his meditative state as Arlize's emotions bled into his own, amplifying his grievances from a college student's hurt to the hardened resolve of a battle-tested Sword Epoch.

With these emotions came vivid sensory memories: a sword's weight, battlefield smoke, spiced wine, and mana crackling through fingertips. These weren't just recollections—they became part of him.

As memories flowed, mana coiled beneath his skin like a living thing. Faint blue patterns traced his forearms—not visible to normal sight but glowing with inner luminescence to his enhanced perception. Ancient symbols containing power and purpose.

He pushed aside emotions, reaching for the skill he desired: instantaneous sleep.

Another memory unfolded—Arlize, exhausted at a battlefield's edge after three days with minimal rest, faced an approaching enemy force. With twenty minutes before their arrival, he sat beneath a tree, assuming the same cross-legged position Nick held now. His breathing shifted—four counts in, hold for seven, out for eight. His focus narrowed, and sleep came suddenly, like flipping a switch.

Nick felt the pattern lock into his mind—the breathing, the focus, the transition. But with it came a shift in identity. For a heartbeat, he wasn't sure if he was Nick accessing Arlize's memories or Arlize looking through Nick's eyes.

The disorientation passed, leaving Nick shaken but enlightened. This wasn't just borrowing skills—it was a merging of souls, with all its power and peril.

As his meditation deepened, Nick sensed something unexpected—a dormant structure within his consciousness, like a complex system waiting to be activated. Integrated with his mana pathways, it was distinct, structured, and deliberate in design.

Is this what awakened in me last night? Some kind of... mana operating system?

Before he could explore further, the connection faded as his concentration wavered.

He opened his eyes, blinking as his dorm room came into focus. His perception had changed—the room's dimensions seemed off to eyes accustomed to ancient architecture. Modern objects appeared both familiar and strange.

The most striking change was how he perceived electronics. His laptop, phone, and the dorm's electrical systems pulsed with energy patterns resembling mana flows. Seeing them through Arlize's perspective revealed their true nature—technology and magic sharing the same fundamental principles, separated only by methodology and understanding.

Had it worked? Only one way to find out.

He glanced at his watch—11:42 PM. He would test Arlize’s technique, aiming to wake at 5:30 AM, his usual time.

Nick lay on his bed, hands at his sides. Four counts in. Hold for seven. Out for eight. His mental focus narrowed to a pinpoint as he visualized the exact time to awaken. He noticed faint blue mana gathering around his temples, sealing the command into his subconscious.

Between one heartbeat and the next, consciousness slipped away, precise and controlled.

Nick’s eyes snapped open. No grogginess, no disorientation—just immediate alertness. He glanced at his watch: 5:30 AM exactly. The technique had worked perfectly.

A smile curved his lips as he rose, refreshed despite less than six hours of sleep. After mastering Arlize’s enhanced awareness, the instant sleep technique was another valuable skill integrated. His arsenal was growing.

One by one, he thought as he stretched. I’m reclaiming everything I need to survive whatever’s coming.

As he began his workout, Nick channeled a thin stream of mana through his muscles, enhancing his performance. The difference was subtle but significant—increased stamina, faster recovery, sharper focus. Not enough to appear superhuman, but enough to give him an edge others would attribute to natural fitness.

Thursday had begun.

The morning followed his routine—efficient workout, quick breakfast, then off to his Thursday classes: Statistics and Intro to Business.

As Nick entered the statistics classroom, he noticed a student he didn’t recognize, seated despite Nick being fifteen minutes early. The newcomer’s straight-backed, military-like posture caught his attention—or rather, Arlize’s attention, as Nick referred to his heightened awareness.

More unsettling was Nick’s mana-enhanced perception of a faint energy signature around the man, similar to what he’d sensed on Jordan but stronger. It wasn’t active mana use, but a residual trace from repeated exposure.

Nick took his usual seat, observing the stranger peripherally. The man, in his early twenties, had close-cropped dark hair and sharp eyes that scanned the room in a practiced pattern. His civilian clothes—jeans and a button-down—were worn with a uniform-like demeanor.

As students arrived, the stranger’s body language subtly shifted, relaxing but still vigilant.

When Jordan arrived and greeted Nick casually, Nick watched for any interaction with the military-postured student. There was none—no acknowledgment, no glances—but Nick felt the classroom dynamic shift.

“Morning,” Jordan said, his voice overly cheerful. “Sleep well?”

“Well enough,” Nick replied, noting Jordan’s energy signature had strengthened overnight, suggesting prolonged mana-tech contact.

Professor Feldman began her lecture on probability distributions. Nick took notes while discreetly observing both Jordan and the new student.

As Feldman explained statistical modeling, Nick saw parallels to how Arlize calculated battle probabilities. The warrior-mage used mana to enhance projections, predicting enemy movements with remarkable accuracy.

Could I apply the same principles to modern data analysis? Nick wondered. Enhance computational models with mana for superior results? The thought intrigued him, opening new possibilities for his abilities.

Midway through class, Professor Feldman assigned group work on statistical problems. Students reluctantly formed pairs. Before Nick could decide on a strategy, Jordan turned to him expectantly.

“Partners?” Jordan asked, pulling his chair closer.

Nick nodded, noticing the military-postured student paired with a nervous freshman a few rows away. Just random grouping, he thought.

As they worked, Nick found himself impressed by Jordan’s mathematical intuition despite his casual attitude. Another inconsistency to file away.

“So,” Jordan said, voice low, “noticed the new guy?”

The question caught Nick off guard. He maintained a neutral expression. “New guy?”

Jordan tilted his head toward the military-postured student. “That guy with the military bearing. Transferred in late.”

“Hadn’t noticed,” Nick lied, glancing up casually. “Just focused on these problems.”

Jordan’s eyes met his, searching, then he grinned. “Yeah, well, not all of us are statistics savants. Some notice people.”

The comment could have been friendly banter, but something in Jordan’s tone suggested otherwise. Was he testing Nick’s observation skills or deliberately drawing attention to the new student?

“What about him?” Nick asked, engaging directly.

Jordan shrugged. “Nothing specific. Just has that ROTC vibe. Bet he’s on a military scholarship.”

The assessment matched Nick’s own thoughts, heightening his suspicion. Why point it out?

“Maybe,” Nick replied. “Not really my business.”

Jordan’s pencil paused mid-calculation. “Fair enough. Just making conversation.”

As they continued, Nick subtly extended his mana-enhanced perception, trying to detect any communication between Jordan and the military student. He noticed both occasionally touched their right wrists, as if checking or activating something there.

Coordinated surveillance, Nick realized. Why? Who are they reporting to?

They finished the problems in silence, leaving Nick with more questions. When class ended, he packed up, noting the military-postured student left first, moving purposefully toward the exit.

“We’re still on for Sunday, right?” Jordan asked as they walked out. “For the calc quiz prep?”

“Yeah,” Nick confirmed. “Noon in the library study rooms.”

“Perfect,” Jordan nodded. “I’ll bring coffee.”

“Make mine black,” Nick replied, already planning to probe Jordan’s inconsistencies during their study session.

As Jordan headed to the campus center, Nick took a different path, hoping to spot either Jordan or the military student again. Neither appeared visible in the crowds of students.

Nick made his way to Intro to Business, pondering the implications. His instincts—or perhaps Arlize’s—suggested the new student’s arrival wasn’t coincidental. But how did this connect to Jordan’s interest in his relationships with Matt and Sarah? Were they somehow linked to the events leading to his past death?

Too many questions, not enough data. That would change tonight.

Business class proceeded as usual, though Sarah’s gaze lingered on Nick thoughtfully. Matt seemed less engaged, messaging on his phone with expressions alternating between smugness and intense concentration.

Using his enhanced perception, Nick detected stress in Matt—subtle signs like increased heart rate, micro-perspiration, and pupil dilation whenever he looked Nick’s way. Whatever was happening, Nick’s behavior was affecting Matt more than he outwardly showed.

Nick took detailed notes, participating strategically when Professor Williams asked questions, displaying intelligence without revealing his full capabilities—a careful performance to establish credibility without raising suspicion.

When class ended, Nick waited, organizing his notes meticulously while watching Matt hurry out, already on his phone. Sarah, predictably, approached his desk.

“Nick,” she said, her voice once sweet now triggering his wariness. “Ignoring my texts?”

Nick zipped his backpack, unhurried. “Been busy.”

His keen perception revealed Sarah’s deception—her smile, posture, even breathing were perfectly calibrated. It was a physical poker face, suggesting training beyond typical social skills.

“Too busy for friends?” Sarah’s eyes studied him with an intensity that once flattered him. Now he saw the calculation—the same analytical look she gave test problems.

“Just prioritizing,” Nick replied, standing. “Still getting my routine down.”

Sarah matched his pace as they left the classroom. “Your priorities have shifted. Matt said you blew him off yesterday.”

The mention of Matt—establishing their unity. A familiar tactic. They’d always presented as a package deal socially, despite claiming they weren’t dating.

“Like I told Matt, people change,” Nick said, adjusting his course to maintain distance.

Sarah laughed, practiced and precise. “Not overnight. The Nick I knew couldn’t solve business problems like you did Tuesday without getting lost. And he wouldn’t turn down a party to study.”

At the building’s exit, sunlight streamed through the glass doors. Nick paused, facing her.

“Maybe you didn’t know me as well as you thought,” he said simply. “We only hung out for a year. Before that, I was just another face to you.”

Something flickered across Sarah’s face—surprise or irritation. She quickly recovered, softening her expression.

“Look, I’m just saying it’s weird, okay? We’ve known each other since freshman year. You don’t have to put on a new persona for college.”

Nick recognized the manipulation tactics instantly, drawing from Arlize’s court intrigue experience and his own memories of Sarah’s subtle maneuvering.

“I appreciate the concern,” Nick replied neutrally. “But I’m good. Really.”

Sarah looked like she had more to say, but her phone chimed. She glanced at it, then back at Nick, indecision briefly crossing her face.

“This conversation isn’t over,” she said lightly, her eyes serious. “See you at Alpha Phi tomorrow, right?”

The question was bait. Previously, he would have jumped at the chance for inclusion.

“We’ll see,” Nick replied vaguely. “I’ve got a lot on my plate.”

Sarah’s expression hardened momentarily before she smiled. “Well, the invitation stands. Later, Nick.”

As she walked away, Nick felt grim satisfaction. Their social pressure was failing. They’d try new tactics soon, revealing more about their true intentions.

The afternoon was dedicated to preparation. Tonight’s mission required careful planning.

The library’s reference section provided the perfect sanctuary for Nick’s investigation. Surrounded by dusty economic journals, he opened his laptop and launched a secure browser.

His first task: establish financial independence. Previously, Nick had faced crushing student debt and few prospects. This time would be different.

He accessed the investment platform he’d created under an alias. Public terminals were safer, but he couldn’t risk being seen. The security measures he’d installed would impress even professional hackers.

“Let’s see if my memory’s as good as I think it is,” he murmured.

Nick searched for Helios Pharmaceuticals—a biotech firm set to announce a cancer treatment breakthrough in six weeks. The stock traded at $2.17 per share but would jump to nearly $40 after the announcement.

He had $2,500 saved from summer jobs and gifts. Not much, but a start.

Nick hesitated, cursor hovering over the “Buy” button. What if his interference had altered the timeline? What if the breakthrough never happened now?

Trust what you know, he thought. Information asymmetry is your advantage.

He executed the order: 1,150 shares at market price. In six weeks, that $2,500 investment would be worth over $45,000—enough to fund the next phase without raising financial aid red flags.

As the transaction processed, Nick noticed a faint blue glow from his fingertips on the trackpad. The mana responded to his intent, subtly interfacing with the digital system. When the confirmation appeared, the numbers shimmered briefly, as if reality acknowledged the ripple he’d just created.

The Arcadian System at work again, he thought. I need to understand this connection.

Nick then turned to investigating Matt Harrington. Using the university’s portal and a security exploit from his first college stint, he accessed off-limits student records.

Matt’s transcript showed suspiciously perfect grades. Nick cross-referenced these with high school newspaper archives, looking for anomalies.

An article from their junior year listed Matt as district champion in mathematics, yet Nick remembered him struggling with basic calculus. Something didn’t add up.

He discovered a cached deleted article: “Academic Integrity Committee Reviews Regional Competition Results.” Though Matt wasn’t named, the timing aligned perfectly with his sudden academic “success.”

Nick recorded meticulous notes in an encrypted file and erased all traces of his search. Not smoking-gun evidence, but it confirmed his suspicion: Matt’s record was artificially polished, likely through his father’s influence.

Before logging off, Nick searched for Nexus Virtual Technologies. In his previous life, this startup had revolutionized gaming with neural interface technology that blurred the lines between virtual and reality. Their breakthrough announcement was due in two years, but now they were barely on anyone’s radar.

A tech magazine dismissed them as an “overhyped startup with unrealistic claims about direct neural feedback.” Nick smiled at their shortsightedness. If only the writer knew what was coming.

He marked the company’s founders and early investors as his next investment target after the Helios windfall.

As he scrolled through limited information on neural interfaces, Nick felt a strange resonance—as if he understood the principles from a different angle. The engineering diagrams looked modern, but the concepts reminded him of mana pathways in his body.

Is this what my parents were researching? he wondered. A connection between mana and neural interfaces?

The word “betrayal” in an article triggered something deep in Nick’s mind. The library faded, replaced by a memory that wasn’t his—or rather, wasn’t Nick Valiente’s.

The Great Hall of Aurilia’s royal palace stretched before him, marble columns reaching a vaulted ceiling adorned with frescoes of the empire’s founding. Arlize Dentragon stood before the Emperor’s council, his armor gleaming.

“The northern forces have been repelled, Your Majesty,” Arlize reported, kneeling. “The border is secure.”

The Emperor nodded, but General Kadros—Arlize’s mentor—exchanged a glance with Lady Serenne, the court magician and Arlize’s former lover.

A fleeting look, but Arlize caught it. The northern border attack was orchestrated from within. His evidence confirmed it: documents, intercepted messages, payments to enemy commanders.

Betrayal from those he trusted most. Those he loved.

As Arlize stood in court, he felt a hum from the mana-tech in his armor—a warning system he’d designed himself. Blue energy coursed through conduits, alerting him to deception while he maintained his exterior calm. His enemies thought themselves invisible, but Arlize’s enhancements revealed their subterfuge.

Arlize decided to gather evidence, build his case, and expose the traitors threatening the empire—not with hasty accusations, but with irrefutable proof and careful strategy.

The memory faded, leaving Nick blinking at his laptop in the quiet library. His heart raced, but his mind felt clear. Blue energy flickered at his fingertips before he suppressed it.

The parallel was unmistakable. In both lives, he faced betrayal from trusted positions. The answer wasn’t confrontation but methodical evidence gathering. Technology—whether mana-tech or modern electronics—was key to uncovering the truth.

“History won’t repeat,” Nick whispered, closing his laptop. “Not this time.”

Professor Williams’s office hours were 4–5 PM on Thursdays, but Nick noticed him arriving earlier. At 3:45, Nick knocked on the open door.

“Professor Williams? Do you have a moment?”

Williams looked up, recognizing him. “Ah, Mr. Valiente. The information asymmetry expert.” He gestured to a chair. “Come in. What can I do for you?”

Nick took the seat, maintaining a confident but respectful demeanor. “I wanted to follow up on the Coleman Business Fellowship.”

Williams nodded, setting down his pen. “Glad you’re following up. It’s refreshing to see a student take initiative.”

“I don’t believe in letting opportunities pass,” Nick replied. “You mentioned the Fellowship is meant for sophomores, but sometimes extended to standout freshmen.”

Williams leaned forward, clearly pleased. “That’s right. Rare cases when a freshman shows exceptional aptitude and initiative.” He paused. “Your answer in class showed you think more analytically than most first-years.”

Using enhanced perception, Nick noticed something unusual about Williams’s energy signature—similar to Professor Ellis, though less pronounced. The similarity couldn’t be coincidental.

Another observer? Nick wondered. Or something else entirely?

Nick smiled modestly. “I’ve always approached business strategically. The fellowship would help me develop that further.”

“Indeed.” Williams pulled a folder from a drawer, sliding an application across the desk. “It requires a research proposal, two faculty recommendations, and proof of academic excellence. The deadline is October 15th.”

Nick scanned the form. “And if selected?”

“A $5,000 stipend for independent research, mentorship from a business faculty member, and priority for summer internships with our corporate partners.” Williams leaned in. “It’s highly competitive—only two students are selected each year.”

“I understand.” Nick met his gaze. “Who else is on the selection committee?”

Williams raised an eyebrow. “Dean Harrison from Finance, Professor Kelley from Marketing, and a representative from our corporate sponsor. This year, I believe it’s Callahan Industries.”

Nick kept his expression neutral despite recognizing the name. Callahan Industries—owned by Matt’s father. Another connection he hadn’t anticipated.

Nick noticed a subtle shift in Williams’s energy when he mentioned Callahan Industries—a momentary change that seemed involuntary.

“Thank you, Professor. I’ll submit a compelling application.”

Williams nodded. “I should warn you, Mr. Valiente—freshman applicants face significant scrutiny. The committee will want to know why you’re in such a hurry.”

Nick stood, folding the application. “Some people recognize time as our most valuable resource. I don’t waste it.”

Williams’s expression shifted to genuine curiosity. “Well said.” He extended his hand. “I look forward to your application.”

As Nick left, he felt satisfied. The Coleman Fellowship would provide corporate connections, research resources, and insights into Callahan Industries while enhancing his academic credentials.

In his previous life, he hadn’t discovered this opportunity until junior year when Matt was already using it to secure internships and build his network.

Not this time, Nick thought, carefully placing the application in his bag. This time, I’m the one with the advantage.

Back in his dorm room, Nick pinned a new note to his bulletin board—a to-do list mapping out his next moves:

* Complete Coleman application
* Research Callahan Industries connections
* Follow up on Prof. F’s reading list
* Locate M.Z. in the Engineering dept.

The last item referred to Maggie Zhang, an engineering student whose hacking skills had made her legendary on campus. She’d been recruited by a major tech company but was notorious for accessing supposedly secure systems.

Nick had never interacted with her before, but he remembered the stories. To uncover the neural interface conspiracy, her skills would be invaluable.

He checked his watch—still early enough to scout the engineering building before dinner. Nick grabbed his laptop bag and headed out with determination.

Passing a mirror, Nick briefly glimpsed a taller figure in ornate armor, eyes glowing with blue energy. The image vanished instantly, but its message was clear: he and Arlize Dentragon were becoming more integrated.

The foundation was laid. Financial independence, physical training, and academic advancement were all in motion. Now, it was time to build alliances.

Nick felt a grim smile form as he walked across campus. For the first time since his rebirth, he wasn’t just reacting—he was actively shaping his path.

I’m coming for you, Matt, he thought, feeling mana pulse with his resolve. This time, I’ll be the one holding all the cards.

1l18g1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/PVCs/comments/1l18g1k/pvcs_what_has_worked_for_me/,PVCs: What has worked for me,"Hello community! I've had PVCs for about 12 years now(diagnosed at 18), though I hadn't had much trouble with them until the past 4 years when they really started flaring up on and off more. I just thought I would come on and tell ya'll what had worked for me so far that might help some of you. The strange thing about PVCs is it feels like you're basically trying to find the ""Secret Krabby Patty Formula"" for your body, so take what you will from this. Some of these I have gotten from others on here and they worked for me, so I am thankful for everyone sharing their experiences so that I can add more to my list because this shit is FRUSTRATING at times.  
I don't have a super specific thing that triggers my PVCs, I just always say they are triggered if I am mentally stressed or if my body is stressed. I have gotten increased PVCs due to illness, stress, teeth issues, hormones, heat, etc. It seems to mostly be my body's way of being like, ""Eh, something mildly to moderately upsetting in here. Figure it out and fix it."" Lol. But it seems when I address those issues, they reduce to maybe getting 1 or 2 a day, sometimes just a couple a month. 

1. Hormones- Get that checked of you can. I have PCOS and I have found that taking Inositol daily helps to balance my hormones, thus also help reduce PVCs. Also be aware that PVCs can act up around your period because of the change in hormones. I also have hypothyroidism(because why not, LOL), and my PVCs also reduced with taking Levothyroxine. 

2. Electrolytes: Drink some kind of electrolyte beverage daily and make sure you're getting you potassium and magnesium. My doctor told me that they want people with PVCs slightly higher levels in those areas. Not out of normal range, but just on the higher end of normal. Be careful with magnesium supplements, as not everyone can tolerate them well. I recommend sticking to trying to work it in through diet unless directed otherwise.  

3. Sodium: I have seen some back and forth on sodium on here. For me, I will notice my PVCs chill out a little sometimes I have have a salty snack. I think it may have to do with having a lower end of normal blood pressure, so a little extra sodium kind of helps even it out more. Idk, not a doctor, but that's just what I have kind of gathered and the evidence supports it for me. 

4. Hydration: Like everyone says, make sure you are drinking water. Just make sure you are having a good balance of water and electrolyte. You want that pee to be at least a little bit yellow. 

5. Digestive issues: I got my gallbladder removed and that initially helped, but that about a year later, I started feeling really acidic all the time and started getting heartburn. Might have a bit of GERD? Not diagnosed though. PVCs increased A LOT. I started taking Prilosec(Omeprazole), and that helped both issues a TON. Tums can also help a bit too, but not as long term. 

6. VITAMINS BABY: Get those vitamins checked out of you can. This is one of the main things I accredit to my PVCs chilling out right now if fixing my vitamin levels; Vitamin D3 and B12 in particular. My D3 was down to 10, needs to be over 30. B12 was on the low end of normal, so my doctor told me to go ahead and take a supplement for that as well. From what I have read, low vitamin D is in particular linked to increased PVCs and a lot of people don't get enough of it. I feel like after being on vitamin D3 for a month, my body in general feels more put together. I am on a prescription D3 right now, but after that runs its course, my doctor told me to take a daily supplement of 2,000 IU. For my B12, I take 1,000 IU. 

  
7. Keep it chilly. I have noticed that my PVCs act up a bit if I am getting too hot. There are also times when I will just chill myself if my PVCs are increased because I don't seem to have them as much if I am shivering. 

8. Yoga/reiki/stress management. You gotta find something to help you relax, dawg! Like, truly relax. Going to yoga once a week has really helped with stress management. Go to a studio, a lot of them are about $15-$20 a class, or do it at home. There are plenty of YouTube videos for free. I also recommend a reiki session if it's available to you if you are into that sort of thing. Maybe it was just a mental thing, but I did feel a lot better afterwards. I was like, literally so desperate to find anything to help reduce the PVCs and just make me mentally feel better because I was so stressed about them, so I gave it shot. I file this under an act of self-care and stress management. 

9. Exercise. I was exercising for consistently for about 2 months and I did feel really good in that time, but then some stuff happened and my PVCs started acting up while I was exercising, so I got spooked out of it. Slowly kind of reintroducing myself to it now that my PVCs have chilled out, but it is proven that regular exercise is good for your heart and can reduce PVCs over time for some. 

10. Teeth Issues: I noticed back when I was getting a lot of tooth infections, my PVCs would increase until I got on antibiotics. I got a root canal on the tooth and the PVCs basically disappeared for a while after that. Same with getting wisdom teeth removed, because they were always infected. There's a lot of evidence that the teeth an affect the heart so, just something to think about. 

11. No caffeine. The thing that triggered my PVCs to become as much of a problem as they have been was my caffeine intake. I was downing caffeine all day every day, not eating much, just surviving on the buzz because of my job. Then I was knocked out of work for a month and a half due to dehydration, stress, exhaustion, and OVER-CAFFIENATION. I haven't had a lick of caffeine since that day, but every since then, my PVCs have been an up and down rollercoaster, and me trying to figure out what my body wants/needs to be okay. Not saying you can't have a cup of coffee or tea every day, but I would definitely steer clear of energy drinks and just limit your general intake. 

12. THERAPY. Everyone needs to get some therapy if they can. These PVCs have driven me insane time and time again. I am constantly afraid something is wrong with me even though I have had all the testing that has shown me otherwise. Turns out I have OCD that focuses a lot on my health anxieties. You could also have Illness Anxiety Disorder, which is having a lot of anxiety around your health, but treatment is the same as for OCD. Health issues are very anxiety inducing, especially with having to do with the heart. I was having panic attacks all the time, but not recognizing them as panic attacks because of my PVCs; so I would end up at the ER thinking I was dying, only for them to tell me I was absolutely fine. Healthcare is too expensive, y'all.  Something kind of dumb that really helped me when I was in states of panic was actually looking up a YouTube video for panic attacks. There's videos on there where a tranquil voice will kind of guide you through the panic attack and tell you that what you are feeling is normal and it will pass. It helped a lot just having an external voice to focus on and let me know I am not going to die and this is completely normal. But yeah, therapy would be good if you can. You can look for offices with sliding scale payments if you money is an issue. I do virtual therapy through SpringHealth, and my insurance actually covers virtual appointments 100%, which is wild to me because my insurance sucks in all other areas. Lol. I do prefer in-person therapy, but ya know, free is free and it's been going pretty well regardless.

  
But yeah, that's just what has worked for me so far. Like I said, not a doctor or anything, this is just what I have found by my own trial and error, and by working with my doctor. I have gone to a cardiologist, but I don't feel like a lot of them take PVCs very seriously, but my GP has been AMAZING and has shown more care about it than my cardiologist ever did. She hooked me up with a stress test, which I highly recommend if you can just for the piece of mind. They take an ultrasound of your heart before and after physical activity, and your heart is monitored the entire time. It really brought me piece of mind of nothing structurally or functionally being wrong with me, just plain old PVC heartbeats. So, don't be pressed about getting a cardiologist if your GP is willing to work with you. 

But, if you have any questions, feel free to ask! I know a lot of this isn't super groundbreaking and probably a lot of repeat info, but I just hope it helps anyone who is struggling to maybe have a couple of things they can try. 👻",5,1748836643.0,PVCs,0,1.0,False

[\[Chapter 1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1l14zwu/rebirth_protocol_bk1_ch_1_blood_memory/)

Tuesday morning, Nick's eyes snapped open at 5:30 AM without an alarm. The memory of his death jolted him awake, a phantom pain echoing a wound that hadn't happened yet. Another day in the time-traveler's paradox: wake up, remember dying, try not to do it again.

He lay still, heart racing, processing his strange reality: memories of a murder not yet happened, future betrayals, and skills from two lives. The knife memory made him touch his side, finding it whole.

Nick flexed his fingers, focusing on the energy he'd discovered. A faint blue shimmer traced his palm. The connection to Arlize's abilities was growing but unpredictable. He needed to understand it. The Arcadian System exists here somehow, he thought. I need to figure out why.

Yesterday was his first full day at Westlake University—Biology, Calculus, and an encounter with Sarah and Matt. Today was Statistics and Intro to Business. In his previous life, he'd barely scraped by. This time would be different.

He checked his phone. Sarah's unread text from last night: ""Hey, great seeing you again today! We should catch up soon. - Sarah"" A cold tightening gripped his chest. In his previous life, he'd have responded quickly, desperate for her attention. Not this time, Sarah, he thought grimly. This time you chase me.

He wouldn't be pulled into their orbit again. The gravitational pull of Sarah's smile and Matt's charisma had dragged him into a death spiral once before. This time, he'd set the terms.

He rose silently, slipping into his workout clothes. The campus would still be quiet, most students sleeping off orientation parties or nursing anxieties. Perfect.

The cool morning air bit at his skin as he ran, feet pounding a steady rhythm on empty paths. His young body protested, muscles not yet conditioned to his punishing pace. Nick pushed through, embracing the pain. It clarified what was real.

Two years until they try to kill me, he thought, breath forming small clouds. Two years to ensure they fail.

Rounding the science building, Nick recalled yesterday's odd security panel interaction. On impulse, he approached it, ensuring he was alone. Campus cameras wouldn't activate until 6:00 AM—a detail he knew from a past prank gone wrong.

Before the panel, Nick concentrated, drawing on Arlize's memories. The techno-mage perceived mana through conductors, and Nick shifted his perception.

Faint blue lines traced the panel's circuitry. Digital components glowed, pulsing with energy. Nick traced a basic unlocking rune from Arlize's repertoire. The panel beeped softly, its light turning green. The door clicked open.

Nick stepped back, heart racing. It worked. He manipulated the system using principles from another world. The Arcadian System isn't just a memory, he realized. Its principles apply here too. Technology responds to the same mana formulas Arlize used for enchanted tools.

The implications staggered him. Mastering this fusion could grant access to security systems, financial networks, communications—all through techno-magical principles unknown here. But he needed to be careful. One mistake could expose him.

By 7:00 AM, he had showered and dressed in a plain navy button-down and dark jeans—understated, forgettable. In his past life, he'd dressed to impress. That Nick died in an alley, betrayed and alone. This Nick would be a shadow, watching and planning—until it was time to strike.

Morning sunlight streamed through the statistics classroom windows. The room smelled of fresh markers and lemon disinfectant, with coffee undertones. Chair legs squeaked as students settled, voices echoing off the high ceiling. The room was cooler than outside, the air conditioning stirring papers and rustling through Nick's notebook.

Nick sat at the front, hearing the professor clearly and seeing every board detail. He set up his tablet, activating the note-taking app—a habit from war councils with Arlize. Preparation was essential. Another day, another battlefield, he thought. Different weapons, same principles.

The classroom filled with nervous freshmen. Nick focused forward, avoiding eye contact, a battlefield skill. Jordan sat beside him with coffee, just like in Calculus yesterday.

""Morning,"" Jordan said, dropping his backpack. ""You're early.""

Nick noted his casual demeanor. ""Yip.""

Jordan sipped his coffee, spilling a drop. ""Checked the dining hall, but you must've been up at dawn.""

Nick shrugged. ""Early start, early advantage.""

""Man, you're intense,"" Jordan chuckled, fumbling for his tablet. ""Most freshmen are still passed out from parties.""

""Not my style,"" Nick replied, turning back.

Jordan studied him. ""Those people yesterday, Matt and Sarah? What's their deal?""

Nick stayed neutral. ""High school classmates. Nothing special.""

""Right,"" Jordan said, glancing at the door. ""Looks like we're about to start.""

Professor Feldman entered at 8:00 AM, holding papers. A slight woman with steel-gray hair, her sharp eyes assessed the room like a military officer.

""Good morning, everyone. Welcome to your first statistics class,"" she announced. ""We'll go over the syllabus, then key concepts for the semester.""

Jordan whispered to Nick, ""Looks like we're starting slow.""

Nick stayed silent, pulling his tablet closer. He'd struggled with statistics before, barely passing. But now, with Arlize's tactical mind, he saw patterns and probabilities.

As Professor Feldman explained confidence intervals, a memory from Arlize's life surfaced. During the Aurilian Wars, Arlize predicted enemy troop movements with limited intelligence, developing a medieval statistical analysis that saved his regiment.

A formula appeared in Nick's mind—not standard equations, but a variation with mana flow patterns. Arlize used these to predict energy dispersal on battlefields, targeting enemies precisely.

Nick realized statistics were about predicting patterns and outcomes, just like the Arcadian System. He sketched Arlize’s notations, the symbols flowing naturally. These weren’t just memories—they were skills from past lives. How deep was this connection? Could he control which aspects of Arlize emerged in critical moments?

Concepts once bewildering now seemed clear, like troop movements on a map. Nick understood statistics with an intuitive clarity that seemed impossible before.

When Professor Feldman asked about sampling distributions, Nick was the first to raise his hand.

“Mr. Valiente?” she prompted.

“The central limit theorem tells us the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases,” Nick explained confidently. “This allows reliable predictions even with non-normal population distributions.”

Professor Feldman paused, surprised. “That’s... precisely correct, Mr. Valiente. Well done.”

Nick ignored Jordan’s curious glance. Another victory in his academic campaign.

During the lecture, Nick noticed something strange. By focusing like Arlize, he saw faint blue lines tracing electricity through the projector and computer systems. The Arcadian System wasn’t just a tool—it was a way to perceive reality, seeing energy flows powering the world.

By class end, Nick’s tablet was filled with notes—half statistics, half encoded Arcadian formulas only he could interpret. The fusion of knowledge from two lives was becoming powerful, an advantage for him.

Nick and Jordan grabbed lunch at the campus café, discussing class while avoiding personal topics. Nick steered the conversation toward campus resources, gathering information while revealing little about himself.

“You’re different from most freshmen,” Jordan noted. “Most people are either terrified or trying too hard to be cool.”

“Just focusing on what matters,” Nick replied casually, eyeing the café’s electronic ordering system. With the right mana-tech formula, he could access its network...

Jordan’s eyes narrowed. “I talked to some Westridge guys last night at the dorm mixer. They were surprised you aced that calculus quiz.”

Nick felt a chill but kept his face neutral. He hadn’t planned for people to discuss him so soon.

""One of them—Ryan?—said you barely passed math last year,"" Jordan continued. ""Said you were more of a basketball guy than academic."" He bit his sandwich, eyes watchful.

Nick's mind raced, Arlize's tactical training kicking in. Deny everything? No—partial truth was more convincing.

""I had a wake-up call last summer,"" Nick said evenly. ""Family situation. Realized I was wasting my potential. Spent three months studying and getting my act together.""

Jordan nodded, mustard at the corner of his mouth. ""Makes sense. Sometimes it takes something big to change direction, you know?"" He wiped his mouth. ""Sorry about whatever happened.""

""Thanks,"" Nick replied, relief hidden. Crisis averted, but noted: word was spreading about his academic performance. Another variable to consider.

Jordan nodded slowly. ""Curious about your story. Most don't show up knowing exactly what they want.""

Nick met his gaze. ""Bad experiences teach good lessons."" You have no idea, he thought.

By afternoon, Nick was ready for Intro to Business—a different battlefield. He arrived ten minutes early, choosing a seat with good sightlines of both entrances and the professor's podium.

Sarah Chen was already seated, her dark hair around her shoulders, eyes bright as she chatted with another student. Nick felt a twist in his chest at the sight of her—memory and emotion colliding with the knowledge of what was to come. Her text from last night was unanswered; he recalled her false warmth after Calculus.

You're good, Sarah, he thought, watching her animated conversation. The perfect illusion of sincerity. I almost believed it the first time.

Sarah had been the quiet, brilliant girl in his high school AP classes—always ahead yet approachable. When she showed interest in senior year, Nick was flattered but cautious, unsure why she noticed him. They kept a friendly distance through graduation, aware they were headed to the same university.

He chose a seat several rows away to observe without being obvious. Matt Harrington sauntered in, commanding attention with his confidence—the same self-assurance from yesterday when he invited Nick to a party. Matt spotted Sarah, taking the seat beside her, his hand brushing her shoulder with subtle possessiveness Nick now recognized.

As Matt leaned close to Sarah, whispering something that made her smile, Nick noticed Matt's electronic tablet. Concentrating like in statistics class, Nick perceived the device's energy flows. Faint blue lines traced the circuits. With a focused thought, Nick sent a subtle pulse of mana to the tablet—causing a small glitch, not enough to seem deliberate.

Matt frowned at his flickering screen, tapping it in frustration.

Interesting, Nick thought. The more I practice, the easier it gets.

Matt—star quarterback, class president, and legacy admission to top universities—was the high school's golden boy. His family's wealth paved his way, while Nick fought for opportunities. Despite attending the same school, they lived in different social worlds—Matt at the center, Nick on the edge. Only after choosing Westlake University did Matt show interest in ""reconnecting,"" which Nick saw as calculated networking.

Nick watched with detachment, noting Matt's eyes constantly scanning the room, his gestures toward Sarah tinged with possessiveness, and his calculated charisma—the same performance from the Alpha Phi party invite.

Professor Williams breezed in—energetic and polished. ""Alright, future tycoons and entrepreneurs!"" he announced. ""I'm Professor Williams, and this is Intro to Business. We're here to understand how business shapes the world and how you might shape business.""

Nick was engaged as Williams emphasized practical applications over rote memorization, resonating with Nick's belief that knowledge needs strategic application. Like mana without technique, Nick thought. Raw power is nothing without precision.

""Today we're discussing competitive advantage—the lifeblood of business strategy,"" Williams said, moving to content. ""What gives a company—or an individual—the edge over competitors?""

He described strategic positioning, resource allocation, and market dynamics. Nick took detailed notes, seeing connections to his own situation. Every business strategy mirrored warfare and survival. And in the Arcadian System, Nick realized. Competitive advantage through superior technology and information—what gave Arlize's faction the edge in the Aurilian Wars.

Midway through, Professor Williams paused. ""Let's make this practical. I need a volunteer to give an example of leveraging a hidden competitive advantage.""

Nick kept his eyes on his notes, avoiding being called on. But fate intervened.

""How about... you, in the navy shirt? Your name, please?""

Nick looked up, meeting the professor's gaze. ""Nick Valiente.""

""Well, Mr. Valiente, could you give us an example of leveraging a hidden competitive advantage?""

Nick felt the room's eyes on him—including Sarah's curious gaze and Matt's focused attention. He met Matt's stare before responding.

""Certainly,"" he said. ""A hidden advantage could be information asymmetry—knowing something your competitor doesn't. Like a weakness they've overlooked, or a future market shift only you can see.""

As he spoke, Nick felt warmth in his fingertips—a sensation Arlize had when channeling mana. A faint blue sheen briefly illuminated his pen, unnoticed by others.

Matt's jaw tightened slightly. Sarah tilted her head, curious about his answer, a contrast to her previous dismissive attitude.

""Excellent example,"" Professor Williams praised. ""Information asymmetry is powerful. Care to elaborate on ethical exploitation of such an advantage?""

Nick chose his words carefully. ""Position yourself ahead of changes. If you know something others will discover, you can prepare while they're reacting. The advantage isn't just having information first—it's using that time.""

Like knowing who's going to betray you, he thought, meeting Sarah's gaze. And having two years to prepare.

""Precisely,"" Professor Williams nodded. ""Look for the unseen edge, but true advantage comes from what you build with your head start. Thank you, Mr. Valiente.""

After class, as Nick gathered his materials, Professor Williams approached.

""Mr. Valiente,"" he said quietly. ""Insightful answer. Have you considered applying for the Coleman Business Fellowship? It's usually for sophomores, but we occasionally make exceptions for promising freshmen.""

Nick felt satisfaction—a small but significant victory. In his previous life, he hadn't heard of the Coleman Fellowship until junior year, already dominated by Matt.

""I'd be very interested, Professor,"" Nick replied, maintaining composure while celebrating this unexpected acceleration. ""What does the application process involve?""

""Stop by my office hours this week, and I'll give you the details,"" Professor Williams said. ""The deadline is early October, so you'd have time to prepare a strong application.""

""I'll be there,"" Nick promised. ""Thank you for the opportunity.""

As Professor Williams walked away, Nick savored a moment of triumph. His first real advantage—and judging by Matt's scowl, his competitors noticed.

As students gathered their things, Nick took his time, watching Matt lean in to Sarah with mock surprise.

""Did our Nick just say something intelligent?"" Matt's voice carried its usual patronizing tone. ""Color me impressed. Didn't know you had it in you, champ.""

Sarah laughed, a sound that didn't reach her eyes. ""I guess miracles do happen."" Her voice was sweet with an edge that could cut glass.

And there it is, Nick thought. They were never my friends—I was just their project, their inside joke.

Nick kept his movements measured, giving them time to approach. He didn't wait long.

""That was quite an answer,"" Sarah said as they stopped at his desk, her tone condescending. ""Where'd that come from? The Nick Valiente I remember barely spoke up in econ last year.""

Nick remembered their history—Sarah's sudden interest during senior year, always with Matt nearby, and their abrupt inclusion of him after years of indifference. Those interactions left a lasting impression.

""You could say I've learned the hard way,"" Nick said, meeting Sarah's gaze. For a moment, his mask slipped, showing cold calculation. Sarah blinked, surprised.

""People change,"" Nick added, turning to Matt, his tone light but eyes hard.

""Sure they do,"" Matt laughed, but his eyes didn't. ""Hey, about that Alpha Phi mixer Friday—the offer's still open. Lots of Westridge folks will be there.""

The invitation felt like high school—a dismissive gesture, not genuine. A reminder of Nick's place in their social hierarchy. The same party he'd declined yesterday, now repackaged.

Sarah added, ""It'll be fun. Good for networking."" Her eyes flicked to her phone, and Nick wondered if she was thinking about her unanswered text.

Nick knew the subtext. In high school, ""network"" meant ""try to fit in, but you won't."" Just like yesterday, the same play with different costumes.

""I'll think about it,"" Nick said, non-committal. He sent a subtle pulse of mana to Sarah's phone, making it vibrate.

""Battery warning,"" she muttered, puzzled. ""It was at 80% a minute ago.""

Nick suppressed a smile. His control was improving.

As they walked away, Nick overheard Matt. ""Can't believe he's trying to sound smart now.""

Sarah replied, ""Maybe college will teach him something.""

These weren't casual remarks; they were performances, reminders of Matt's rule, where Nick was the lesser athlete.

Nick saw it all, clear as day. The setting changed, but the script was the same. Matt was still the star, and Nick? He was supposed to stay in his place. But that Nick was long gone.

After they left, Nick gathered his things, replaying the interaction. The challenge was set; the pieces were moving. But this time, he wouldn't be the pawn.

He would be the player they never saw coming.

The campus activities fair was later, but Nick had a different priority. He headed to the library, finding a quiet corner to strategize his academic and social plans.

Nick spread out a blank sheet, using a mix of Arlize's military notation and his own shorthand. He wrote ""NV"" at the center, surrounded by circles: academic excellence, financial independence, strategic alliances, and intelligence gathering. Lines connected targets and actions, forming a web only he could interpret.

He traced the lines with mana, creating a faint blue glow visible only to him. In Arlize's world, these were ""arcane schematic matrices""—living blueprints. Nick wasn't sure if it would work here, but it was worth trying.

After memorizing the diagram, he tore it into pieces, disposing of them in different trash cans—a satisfying act of secrecy. The plan was intact in his mind, ready for execution.

Next, he listed people to watch: Matt, Sarah, and a questionable Jordan. His dorm neighbor's convenient friendliness raised suspicions. In his previous life, he hadn't met anyone named Jordan. Coincidence or more?

He added Westridge High graduates now at Westlake—potential allies or threats. Unlike before, he'd leverage these connections strategically.

By mid-afternoon, Nick crafted a comprehensive strategy. It was time for the activities fair—another battlefield to navigate.

The campus quad was a kaleidoscope of color and sound. Banners snapped above tables. The air carried scents of grilled hot dogs, grass, sunscreen, and new promotional materials. A cappella groups performed by the fountain, their harmonies sometimes drowned by laughter or the dance club's bass. People moved in controlled chaos between booths.

Nick navigated the crowds purposefully, targeting organizations for success. Unlike before, when he drifted aimlessly until joining sports clubs, he now moved strategically.

""Free donuts for Business majors!"" called a senior. ""Join the Business Leaders Association!""

Nick remembered joining this club too late in his previous life. ""What's the commitment?"" he asked, signing up casually.

The senior—Tyler Davidson, familiar from *déjà vu*—explained, ""Weekly meetings, networking events, and a mentorship program pairing freshmen with seniors and alumni.""

Nick nodded, noting the info. ""Applications open when?""

""Next week,"" Tyler said, surprised. ""Most freshmen don't know that.""

""I do my research,"" Nick replied, smiling as he took the brochure.

He continued through the fair, signing up for the Chess Club, Investment Club, and Pre-Law Society.

At the Engineering Club booth, circuit boards and small robotics projects caught Nick's eye. He paused, drawn to the mana-tech principles he'd been exploring. Approaching the table, he examined a sensor-equipped drone.

""Interested in robotics?"" a senior with thick glasses asked, smiling.

""Maybe,"" Nick replied, studying the drone. Blue energy lines traced its circuitry—a web of potential mana pathways. On impulse, Nick signed up. ""What projects do you work on?""

""Everything from basic electronics to advanced AI,"" the senior said. ""We have lab access and funding.""

Perfect, Nick thought. He could experiment with his abilities privately.

As he moved between booths, his instincts tingled. Scanning the crowd, he spotted a familiar figure. Jordan stood across the quad with upperclassmen. His demeanor seemed off—more alert, his usual slouch gone. He nodded, then relaxed as the conversation ended.

Interesting, Nick thought. If his instincts were right, there was more to Jordan than met the eye. Nick concentrated, trying to detect unusual energy around Jordan. He thought he saw a faint shimmer—different from the blue mana lines, more like a subtle air distortion. Then it vanished.

By afternoon's end, Nick had methodically covered the fair, building his academic and social infrastructure. By the time shadows lengthened, he'd established the foundations for his freshman year: strategic club memberships, research connections, and a clear academic path.

The crowd thinned as students retreated indoors. Nick wiped sweat from his brow, deciding on an early dinner before heading back to his dorm. As he turned, a familiar voice cut through the noise.

""Nick! Hey, Nick Valiente!""

His shoulders tensed. He knew that voice too well. Matt Harrington jogged toward him, all perfect teeth and designer clothes. Behind him were two other freshmen, including Ryan Cooper, another Westridge grad.

""Thought that was you!"" Matt clapped Nick's shoulder, making his skin crawl. ""Sarah wondered if you got her text—radio silence isn't your style. In high school, you'd practically break your phone responding to her.""

Nick forced a smile. ""Been busy."" Busy planning how to dismantle your world, he thought.

""Right,"" Matt laughed without warmth. ""We’re getting a group for drinks tonight. Off-campus spot that doesn't card. You in?""

Previously, this invite had pulled him into Matt's orbit, flattered by attention from the high school golden boy, setting him on a path to destruction. Not this time.

""Can't tonight,"" Nick said neutrally. ""Got things to handle before tomorrow's classes.""

Matt's smile faltered. ""Things to handle? Since when do you plan ahead?"" The casual dismissal stung with familiar contempt.

""People change,"" Nick replied simply.

Matt studied him, something calculating behind his friendly facade. ""The offer stands if you finish early. We'll be at The Cellar downtown."" He paused. ""About that Alpha Phi party Friday—exclusive invite. Think about it.""

""I'll think about it,"" Nick said, knowing he wouldn't.

Matt nodded and rejoined his companions. As they walked away, Nick saw Matt whisper to Ryan, both glancing back with amusement. Anger surged—hot and demanding. In his previous life, he'd been their joke—the outsider tolerated for entertainment.

Nick took a deep breath, clenching and unclenching his fists. Anger was useful if controlled. Cold revenge would be more satisfying than an outburst.

As he focused on control, Nick noticed blue energy crackling between his fingertips, responding to his anger. Startled, he closed his hand, ensuring no one saw. My emotions amplify the Arcadian System connection, he realized. Strong feelings make the mana flow more readily. Interesting—and dangerous.

He needed to master this connection quickly. An accidental display would raise questions he couldn't afford to answer.

The dining hall buzzed with activity. Freshmen clustered in nervous groups while upperclassmen moved with confidence. Nick filled his tray with grilled chicken, brown rice, and vegetables—the athlete's meal his coach would recommend. Another timeline adjustment, another advantage.

He chose a corner table with sightlines to both entrances, a habit from Arlize's battlefield experiences. Old soldier's instincts in a college freshman's body.

What a weird fusion we've become, Nick thought wryly. Part vengeful college student, part interdimensional warrior-mage.

As he ate, Nick reviewed his mental notes. He'd dodged Matt's social trap, positioned himself for academic success, and kept emotional distance from Sarah while piquing her interest.

His phone vibrated with Sarah's text: ""Saw you at the activities fair but you disappeared. Still thinking about Friday?""

Persistent, aren't you? Nick thought with grim amusement. What game are you playing, Sarah?

Nick set the phone down without replying. Let her wonder. Her curiosity could be useful later.

As he finished his meal, he focused on his water glass, visualizing the molecular structure, attempting to influence it with mana like Arlize did on the battlefield. The surface rippled, forming a perfect concentric circle before settling.

The Arcadian System applies to more than just electronics, Nick realized. I can affect physical matter too, not just circuitry.

Possibilities expanded by the hour.

Back in his room, Nick added another layer to his encrypted document titled 'Phase One: Foundation Building' and mapped out targets:

1. **Academic Position**: Secure top grades in midterms to establish credibility. Identify key professors for research.
2. **Financial Security**: Initialize investment strategy using future knowledge. Target: small pharmaceutical company announcing a breakthrough soon.
3. **Matt Surveillance**: Document patterns, contacts, and weaknesses. Understand his ties to Sarah's family and possible conspiracy links.
4. **Sarah Assessment**: Maintain distance while gathering intelligence on her family. Determine her role in events leading to his death.
5. **Jordan Investigation**: Background check using university resources. Determine if his presence is coincidence or surveillance.
6. **Arcadian System Development**: Test and develop mana-tech abilities. Start with electronic manipulation, progress to complex applications.

Nick studied the list with cold determination. Phase One would establish his foundation. By semester's end, he'd be ready for Phase Two: Targeted Disruption. Every move needed precise calculation—a single misstep could alert his enemies he was no longer the naïve target they remembered.

Before bed, Nick tried one last experiment. He picked up his phone, channeling mana into it and visualizing protective sigils. Blue light traced the screen, then absorbed into the device.

The phone worked normally, but the messaging app now had a faint blue shimmer and a ""Secure View"" option in Sarah's thread.

*I just created a mana-tech enhancement for my phone*, Nick realized. *The Arcadian System is integrating with modern tech, responding to my intentions.*

He tapped the new option, revealing message content, timestamps, signal strength, and emotional analysis. It was crude but clear—he had modified technology using principles from another world.

A successful second day. The foundation was laid. Tomorrow would be another step in reclaiming his future—ensuring he wouldn't die bleeding out in an alley.

As he drifted to sleep, Nick thought of the Arcadian System—magic and technology now responding to his will. This changes everything, he thought. They won't face the same Nick Valiente. They'll face something they can't understand.

For the first time since his rebirth, Nick Valiente smiled genuinely as he fell asleep.

1l18az7,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1l18az7/first_sex_since_wife_passed/,First sex since wife passed,"My wife of almost 24 years passed 18 months ago at 45 from metastatic breast cancer, after fighting for almost 14 years. In the last 3-5 or so years of her life, radical hysterectomy and various treatments destroyed her sex drive. She really hated it because we had such a great sex life until cancer took that from us. She tried really hard to make it work, but it was very difficult for her. I never made her feel bad for it, as I was just happy with her being with me.

I still have a kid at home 17M, and I don't want to have anything serious that will impact him in any major way, so I don't want anything serious... like, no one will be coming home with me, or meeting my kids any time soon.

After the first year without her, I began contemplating ""putting myself out there"". I dipped my toes into Tinder but after a month, decided to close that up since I wasn't getting any connections. About a month ago, I got onto another dating app, and met a woman. After a couple of days messaging, we had our initial meet up (morning coffee). We discussed what we were both looking for, and it seemed to line up. She is a single mom with 2 teenagers and a busy work life like myself. Neither of us are looking for full on commitment, but we both want to have ""fun"" and companionship. I guess ""friends with benefits"" would be the best way to describe it. Anyway, we both really clicked and began texting every day. We met up for drinks a week later and we both really enjoyed the evening and started planning our first ""adult time""... which had to line up with our schedules, which ended up being a long 3 weeks later. Both of us really looking forward to it.

Before we even met, I let her know that I was widowed for 18 months. She has been extremely supportive and open to talking with me about it, which has made me feel so at ease. I let her know that she is the first woman that I would be intimate with, probably in 4+ years (by my guess).

So 3 weeks later... last night, we had dinner and ""fun"" at her place. We had amazing sex, with the exception being that I could not ""finish"". It really surprised me because I was very much looking forward to it. I was very attracted to her physically and mentally... everything seemed to be going great until it wasn't.

She was wonderful and understanding about it... kept an open mind about how the night would progress and really did not expect it to go as far as it did. None the less, we both had an amazing night despite what happened.

Although we never really spoke about it, I feel strongly that my late wife would want me to do what I could to be as happy as I can be... as long as I'm being the best father to our kids.

I have read through a lot of posts on this sub, and it's really helped me get past the feeling of guilt. I don't really have that guilty feeling, and I didn't last night... at least not consciously. I'm just worried now that our next date night may end up the same way.

There's a game that I randomly got reminded of from an episode of Monster's Inc (Monster at Work).

Specifically the donuts on the table. It's a game I played, I believe on Steam, about 10 years ago (I'm really not sure though, my 20s blend together).

The game involved upgrading things like adding coffee machines and donuts to increase worker productivity / happiness.

Something about the artstyle of this show (that kind of cutesy cartoony look) reminded me. I can't even remember if there was animation at all, or if it was just static images. That's all I can remember sadly. ChatGPT really wanted it to be a TwoPoint game, but none of them look familiar (I have played some TwoPoint games, but that artstyle is too silly for the game I'm thinking of).

I fired him—and got over $90k.,"On Aug 05 of 2023, I drove cross-country from New Jersey to California alone, delivering for Uber Eats to support myself. I was in Burbank, CA, and had just picked up food from Habit Burger & Grill. I turned left on a green arrow when a speeding driver ran a red light and slammed into the passenger side of my 2022 Honda Civic.

Glass exploded everywhere. The glove compartment was crushed shut. For a moment, it felt like time stopped. I sat there, frozen. A couple ran over to check on me. The other driver just sat still. Later, I found out he thought someone had been in the passenger seat.

The cops showed up. I told them everything. Oddly, they warned me not to talk to the group of people standing across the street—they said they were “just looking for money.” But one of them ended up being a witness who caught the whole thing on dashcam.

My car was totaled, and that night I ended up at a junkyard with my things in a shopping cart. Across the street was an IKEA I had visited earlier that same day. I’d been sitting in the parking lot in the sunshine reading their “hej” sign, thinking about life and my family—unaware that fate would lead me right back there in a completely different state.

I had no money and nowhere to stay. I sat on the steps of a nearby church, trying to understand what just happened. Later, someone offered me a ride to a cabin they said was nearby. I accepted.

That ride quickly turned into a horror story. The man got weird. Touchy. At one point, he clutched my neck with one hand while driving. He said insane things like, “I don’t want to suck your cock,” when I’d said nothing remotely sexual. Eventually he pulled over on a deserted road and said, “This is it. We’re here.”

I had the instinct to stay calm. I mentioned a nearby bar he’d spoken about earlier. That suggestion got him moving again. Miraculously, he drove me back to where he picked me up. I survived two nightmares in one day.

The next day, I was walking through California with my shopping cart, blisters on my hands. I bought a coffee with the last of my money. At CVS, while I was on the phone with Uber trying to get a rental, a woman hugged me and said, “God loves you.” I’ll never forget her.

I called my parents. They helped get me a motel for the rest of the trip and paid for my flight home.

Now the legal side:
I hired a top firm called Arash Law that supposedly specialized in Uber accidents. They didn’t even propose a settlement until nearly two years later—and it was $15,000–$25,000. I fired them immediately.

Uber didn’t pay a cent. They had no UIM coverage. GEICO was my last resort. My mom (a former NY attorney) had an intuition to call GEICO herself. We got to a GEICO agent who told us that although rideshare coverage is excluded, my Uber Eats delivery wasn’t “rideshare” by legal definition.

GEICO first offered $50k. I negotiated it to $65k. Then I received the $15k policy limit from the at-fault driver’s insurance (Progressive), and later an additional $9,900+ from GEICO for medical.

That brought my total to over $90,000.

Arash, during a tense call with my parents and me, once said, “You could walk into GEICO’s office with a loaded gun and it wouldn’t make them pay.” Well… we proved him wrong.

It was just me and my mother—arguing sometimes, struggling together—but ultimately doing what no law firm could do for me. She gathered all the documents from my chiropractor, neurologist, and therapist, and we pulled everything together at just the right time.

She told me one day, before the final payout:

“It doesn’t matter what anyone else wants. It only matters what God wants.”
And I remembered that woman at CVS who’d told me the same thing.

That’s how I got justice.
And I’m telling this story so that you know you don’t have to settle—and sometimes the only people you need to fight for you are the ones who love you most.",12,1748835695.0,UberEatsDrivers,4,0.71,False

Research Log (audio) Dr Aegis, Oni Xenotechnological consultant, Head researcher at The Algolis Research and Development laboratory\Nov 23,2528 (Military calendar) 
“Ever Since The beginning of this war, we’ve been trying to reproduce The Covenants energy shields with varying levels of succusses, but recently we have made leaps and bounds towards a breakthrough.
 We have discovered that by using magnetic fields in tandem with contragravity generators (traditionally used on ships to create artificial gravity) we were able to make a hardy practical field that could withstand large kinetic force.
This is at the cost of nearly 98% load on our laboratory fusion generators.
This solves the problem of Magnetic field control. Wail covenant shields are able to control these particles using precise controlled magnetic fields. Our attempts to do the same have met with mixed results.
Our attempts to replicate the shields we needed to replicate the precise shape of magnetic Fields. But the fields we created, either have insufficient strength to contain these partials or require increasing the strength of the field leading to losing the ability to manipulate its shape, Causing the particles to be defuse or ejected from the field entirely.
By repurposing Current “contragravity generators” that are already in widespread use we could decrease the strength need to contain the field. With this we should have operational shields shortly.
If only we could rectify the power needs of these shield projectors.”

Dr Aegis Sits at his desk; papers littering his desk. A lukewarm cup of coffee sits on the side. He leans back in his chair, and it swivels to look out his offices, viewing window, overlooking the laboratory below.
Researchers Stand working next to the Projector prototype. With a bulb mounted on a machined carapace.
 The projector is turned on a low humming can be herd, then it projects a defuse yellow hexagonal grid that after a second shimmers and fades away.
At that moment the door to the door to the office opens. Dr Aegis glasses over, A man in a black uniform walk into the room boots taping on the tile-lament floors.
 
“Rear Admiral Fennec I Wasn’t expecting you, I would have made arrangements” 
Dr Aegis stands to greet him.

“No need Dr I’m here to see the progress on Project Fletcher.” 
Admiral Fennec stated matter of factly

“of course, admiral Please fallow me”
Dr Aegis gestures to the door leading to a catwalk overlooking the lab. 
“As I’m sure you aware Dr we have a lot invested into your claims to be able recreate covenant shielding. Vice Admiral Parangosky is not known for her patience” he states coldly

“I assure you admiral; you will not be disappointed with our progress” Dr Aegis straitens as he says this
Dr Aegis leads Rear Admiral Fennec down a set of stairs to the laboratory floor. The Sheild Projector is located behind bullet resistant glass in the elongated test chamber.

Pointing to a lab assistant Dr Aegis instructs
“Get the Protype ready for another Projectile test”

“Yes Doctor” a nearby lab assistant answers

The assistant presses a series of inputs on a nearby Pannel. The prototype Sheild Projector Begins to Hum to life. Wail other lab technicians push over an M49 Volcan chain gun on a tripod. Once in position the lab technicians leave the test chamber.

“Ready for Projectile test” the Lab assistant announces

“Rerouting laboratory fusion reactor to projector sustainment operations”

Another set of inputs in the Pannel and the shield projector springs to life.
 A yellow hexagonal grid shimmers directly Infront of the projector, wisps of yellow energy simmers off the field.
 The chain gun opens fire, the bullets bounce off the shield pinging and bouncing off the shield and onto the steel paneled walls of the test chamber. After a few seconds of sustained fire, the shield gives out in a sudden flash. The yellow energy fades. The laboratory’s lights flicker as the Sheild projector powers down.

“With some minor Adjustment we should be able to reduce field particle loss increasing the shields strength but for now we’ve only got the field to absorb basic small arms fire” Dr Aegis states

Rear Admiral Fennec looks impressed with the demonstration
But doesn’t hesitate to get straight to business

“Your last report stated that this is extremely power intensive have you found a solution to this?” Admiral Fennec Questions 

“we’ve been working on a project to increase the cooling efficiency of fusion generators we should have a working prototype in next few months” Dr Aegis says with an unsure tone

“there’s Lot riding on this project doctor. Don’t disappoint, we’ll be in touch” with that the Rear Admiral turns and walks back up the Catwalk.
Research Log (audio) Dr Aegis, Algolis R&D laboratory\April 28,2529 (Military Calendar) 
“Ever since our breakthrough we’ve been able to resolve meany of our prior problems, the shield projector no longer leaks particles and are now able to curve the shield surface in a spherical arc, allowing us to make spherical segments of shielding. This Enabled us the creation of directional shield.
 Alongside that my team has developed a modification to current reactors. This refit involves installing a power plant which uses experimental architecture where a single main reactor is nestled within two smaller reactor rings.
 When activated, the secondary reactors supercharge the Cooling system with laser-induced optical slurry of ions chilled to near-absolute zero.
 Intern this means the more you run the reactor the more cooling the reactors receive. This modification enables us to get 300% reactor efficacy. 
	I believe that we have recached a critical point in development my recommendation is to start pushing for field trails on military ships.”


Scene: Aboard the UNSC Winter Conviction – May 13, 2529

Interior. Forward sensor room. Dr. Aegis is staring at the readout, jaw clenched. The shield projector logs are still flagged in red. Across from him, Commander Sloan stands silent, arms crossed.

Dr. Aegis:
“I told you. There’s no Covenant tech in this reactor. We built the projector from scratch using ONI-approved xenotech models and contra-grav drives sourced from decommissioned light cruisers.”

Sloan:
“The telemetry disagrees, Doctor. This resonance pattern here—” he gestures to a fluctuating waveform “—matches Covenant field profiles. We’ve only seen it on Sangheili cruisers and Jackal point-shields.”

Aegis (muttering):
“Of course it does…”

He leans closer, recalibrating the filter overlay. The waveform sharpens—smoother now, more controlled. A signature of a successful shielding envelope.

Dr. Aegis (straightening):
“You’re misreading it. That’s not their tech. That’s ours—working better than it ever has before. What you’re seeing is a perfect containment curve. That field is indistinguishable from Covenant shielding… because we’ve finally caught up.”

Sloan (after a beat):
“…That’s one hell of a compliment, Doctor.”

Aegis (quietly, a smile forming):
“Yes, it is.”

Parangosky:
“Approval for fleet-wide prototype trials. Limited deployment, starting with larger vessels already equipped with high-capacity fusion cores. I propose the designation: Project Fletcher – Phase 2.”

""Groombridge’s Crucible""
Fleet Commander Rear Admiral Cormac Adalai — UNSC Resolute Dawn
May 24th, 2529 — Inner Orbit, Groombridge 1830


---

It always starts with silence. Before the storm, before the shouting, before the heat and fire — it’s always the vacuum’s stillness that haunts you.

I stood on the bridge of Resolute Dawn, hands gripping the lip of the tactical console as the Covenant fleet bled into existence just 90,000 kilometers off our forward bow. Their ships shimmered with blue gravitic energy, folding space like a serpent unraveling mid-strike. Two CAS-class assault carriers, four CCS-class cruisers.

They’d answered our distress beacon.

Good.

We had something to show them.


---

“Fleet, begin deployment,” I ordered. My voice was calm, practiced — even as my gut twisted. “Tusk formation. Shielded ships in the horn. All others support or screen.”

Acknowledge lights pulsed across the ops board.

The fleet moved.

Hammer of Abyss and Winter Gale burned hard to starboard, engines flaring white as they ascended to intercept altitude. Loyal Star and Petra’s Knife swung low to flank beneath Groombridge's magnetic plane — buying time and space. The unshielded ships — Howler, Trafalgar, Gravedust, the rest — they formed the outer line. Sacrificial steel if necessary.

I hated myself for that.

But it was war.


---

The Covenant opened fire first — a standard plasma torpedo spread. Slow, glowing bastards, but impossible to dodge once they locked on.

We met them with MAC fire.

Resolute Dawn’s main gun discharged with a thunder-crack that made the hull shudder, hurling a three-ton slug downrange at .4c. I watched through the data-feed as it slammed into a CCS cruiser. The alien vessel’s shields flared violet — then collapsed. The second MAC round drilled through the bridge. She drifted dead.

Cheers broke out on the bridge.

One down.

Then Hammer of Abyss took a direct hit to her belly.

The plasma tore through her ventral shielding like tissue. She belched fire, broke in half. Her reactor went up with the fury of a dying star.

No time to mourn.


---

“Cycle your projectors!” I shouted to Loyal Star’s captain over comms. “Rotate charge from dorsal to ventral — buy yourself another volley!”

They tried. It worked — for a moment.

Loyal Star launched both MACs, her shielding winking amber-blue as they shifted load mid-burn. She crippled a Covenant cruiser.

Then the Seraphs found her.

They swarmed in low — under her weakened arc — and hit her mid-keel with antimatter charges. The cruiser limped away trailing fire, but she lived.

Barely.


---

Winter Gale punched above her weight.

That ship danced.

She used the drifting husk of Hammer of Abyss as cover, skimming over her flaming corpse to drop MAC fire on a second Covenant cruiser. First round staggered it. Second round cored the plasma turrets. Her shields gave out seconds later — but she was still in the fight.

Meanwhile, our unshielded line was burning.

Trafalgar was bisected by a pulse beam.

Huron tried to run wide, but got bracketed and torn open mid-jump.

The Howler dove low to strike from beneath the Covenant fleet — gutsy move. She never made it. A swarm of Seraphs cut her apart with pinpoint strikes.

Every frigate without shielding was dying in minutes.


---

“Petra’s Knife — status?” I barked.

“Still punching, sir!” came the reply.

They were weaving between wreckage, their shielding flickering but intact. That little Paris-class frigate took a torpedo glancing off her forward arc, then turned and planted a 30mm autocannon burst into a Seraph’s belly. Confirmed kill.

At least one goddamn miracle today.


---

I scanned the display.

Green across Resolute Dawn — for now. Shields vented heat along the bow. Our reactor was hot, screaming on the red line, but still alive.

I’d fired two MAC volleys and kept the ship in one piece.

Shielding wasn’t a panacea, no. But it worked. It bought us time. Bought us lives.

We had lost too many ships, but not the fleet.


---

By the hour’s end, the Covenant fleet began to retreat.

One assault carrier limped away — scorched but whole. The other was venting fuel and bleeding fire, dragging broken cruisers like anchors behind her.

We had won Groombridge.

But barely.

Earth, Days Later — HIGHCOM Briefing, Sydney HQ

The room was cold, and tense. Admiral Stanforth sat across from me. Vice-Admiral Coal stood near the display screen, arms crossed. Dr. Aegis sat to the side, expression unreadable.

“Out of sixteen ships,” I began, “nine were destroyed. Every one of them lacked shielding. But the shielded vessels—they survived long enough to fire twice. And that made the difference.”

Stanforth nodded. “And the power strain?”

“Severe. The ships that didn’t receive the full Aegis Refit suffered performance hits. But where it worked, it worked. We need to standardize this.”

Dr. Aegis finally spoke. “If production at Leonis Minoris IV stays on schedule, we could see fifty percent fleet deployment within six months. Maybe sooner.”

Coal exhaled through his nose. “Then get to Leonis, Doctor. I want a firsthand report. And if the Arbiter does come...”

Stanforth finished the thought. “...we want him to come for something he can’t stop.”

High Charity — Council Chamber of Truth

The Prophet of Truth loomed beneath the golden dome, voice heavy with restrained fury.

“This is the last time you have failed me,” he said to the kneeling Elite Commander.

The Sangheili lowered his head. “My Prophet, the humans’ ships endured our barrages. They bore shielding... imperfect, but effective. They mimicked the gifts of the Forerunners.”

Truth’s eyes narrowed. “Shielding?”

The Elite nodded. “Primitive. Ungraceful. But they bought themselves time. Killed two of our cruisers.”

Silence.

Then rage.

“You let them defile the sacred technologies of the Covenant? You allowed them to survive?”

The Commander lowered his head further. “I accept my punishment.”

Truth raised a hand — then paused.

“No. Not death. Not exile.”

He turned to the gathered council.

“He shall bear the shame. The armor. The legacy. This one shall be Arbiter.”

The Sangheili’s head rose, stunned.

Truth continued.

“You will find the human responsible. You will burn their foundries. And you will reclaim what they have stolen. Go.”

The Arbiter bowed.

“By your will.”

The last glimpse of your face
Still etched in my heart’s embrace.
It felt like it was yesterday,
A memory that wouldn’t decay.

It was August five,
A month into our shared drive.
To see you, I could not wait,
And yet I was still late.

The day started off fine,
I brought food for us to dine.
I chuckled on your couch,
While sensing your silent slouch.

I saw it in your eyes,
That love had met its demise.
I knew it had vanished,
In your heart, I was banished.

Your smile, once very bright,
Now fleeting like a plane in flight.
I had felt great sorrow,
I wanted tears to flow.

But as I left your home,
You hugged me soft as foam.
Then joy returned with light,
As my heart filled with delight.

But on the eleventh,
Your promises were bent.
That night, as I lay in bed,
Tossing, turning, thoughts widespread.

You didn’t keep your word,
""I'm not ready,"" you uttered.
I should’ve stayed in my lane,
To avoid all this pain.

You couldn’t feel our love’s bright spark,
While my heart blazed through the dark.
You're not ready to witness love's art,
While I was prepared from the very start.

You chose to depart,
Like I was never in your heart.
For weeks I was a mess,
With you, I was obsessed.

Our story is now ending,
Memories still clinging.
What was once sweet like candy,
Is now bitter as coffee.

I have lost a close friend,
My courtship came to an end.
Oh, how I miss your tender touch,
But destiny decreed it was too much.

Letting go was never easy,
Like an anchor weighed so heavy.
Memories lingered, a relentless tide,
In the sea, I would once ride.

Now it's time to bid farewell,
Our bond, a fading swell.
I wish you the very best,
On your journey to life's endless quest.

[Diletta Bello + and Sette 270],"Hi folks! Me and my partner have always loved a good coffee and recently after a trip to EU have decided to ditch our Nespresso and look for finer things in life. I was lucky enough to come into the ownership of a Diletta Bello + and a Sette 270 grinder. They needed some TLC, as they were rotting away in a box. I have cleaned both as much as I could and I am waiting for my barista friend to come over to help me do a citric acid rinse, as a back flush and teach me how to do things right. I have tried pulling some espresso shots just as practice before my friend teaches me more, but I wanted to hear any tips and tricks you might have for beginners. 

I know I’m playing with the big guns here and I’m extremely grateful for receiving a gift like this. I know it will be a big learning curve, but I am ready to strap in so I can enjoy some good coffee. 

So far all the shots I have pulled have been tasting quite sour and acidic. I have grinded the beans fine, used a wdt, and a temper. I used around 18g. I’ve been setting the machine at around 246-250 f°. Ive noticed that the shot has been coming out rather fast and liquidy, lacking that honey like consistency. I’m thinking maybe I’m not letting the machine heat up enough before pulling the shot and maybe I should pre infuse the shot a bit before pulling it?

Please be gentle, I am completely green to the game, but willing to listen and learn. I have been doing research since I got the machine but it feels like a lot! Thanks :)

Over the years I thought this back to the odd daily binge when I'm super tired.

Triggers:
1. I realized that a lot of my triggers are just related to not exercising enough or not eating properly or having too much caffeine and not sleeping at night and ... So the solution is obvious just make sure you aren't fighting your limbic system and just do the very basics good enough. No late caffeine, gym once a day (I turned the hot water off to my shower I can only have a hot shower at the gym 😝), eat a salad once a day I can have anything else after a salad 🤷‍♂️
2. I like to code a coffee shops I'll have a different girl every month that will smile or whatever suggesting interest. In my mind if ANY of them were to see me playing a game I think they'd be less interested. Is this rational? Who's to say but it works. I don't play games at coffee shops EVER

Digital Environment:
1. I like building apps, I like coding, and this is really easy to do on Ubuntu and it's slightly trickier on Windows. So I installed Ubuntu and realized that it takes me about 3 days to install steam on Windows, on Ubuntu I do it every 3 to 5 weeks. 
2. Oh no what happens when I actually install steam, I have a cron job that wipes all of my games and (used to) log me off my computer at bedtime. There is no late night gaming if you have to wait another hour to get things installed. I tend to be productive first thing in the morning what that means with this is if I want to install 100 GB game I have to decide that first thing in the morning while I'm the most motivated which almost never happens. What I end up doing is installing a s***** 3gb game that I get really bored of in 2 hours at 7pm 🙃
3. For my laptop because I'm running a low overhead operating system I buy crappier hardware which is cheaper (win) and I can't play good games. On my desktop computer which has good performance I have it plugged into a TV, no desk, no controller. I cannot express to you how annoying it is to use a keyboard without a desk. I only go on it to compile big things or Big Data tasks or  anything that needs a bit of persistence ect. It's one step away from being headless, it's dead to me 
4. when I do play games the games I play are less enjoyable and less team-based so I don't have a social network encouraging me to ""jump in""


The Meta: 
1. I've seen a couple other posts like this in the group but really I had to find what I really enjoy doing and leveling up that and seeing mastery will matter more than anything I accomplish in a video game. Feeling unproductive in real life results in me playing video games, my obvious answer is how can I get more done. How do I get the feeling of leveling up from smaller bits of growth.  how can I build something in stages so I can see the growth over time and see how far I've come.

1l17ooq,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1l17ooq/kudzu_parts13/,Kudzu   Parts:1–3,"My name is Cullen Peek. I’m a detective with the state police.

A few days ago, I got a phone call I wasn’t expecting—from someone I hadn’t heard from in years. Her daughter, Carmen, is missing.

I’m documenting everything here in case it helps. If nothing else, it’s a record that I tried.

Part 1 The Call

My grandma likes to brag about me being a cop—too much sometimes. So when I became a detective earlier last year, it wasn’t a surprise that everyone back home found out too. They had probably heard about the promotion from her, most likely the day it happened.

Normally, people would reach out and ask dumb stuff they could find online in five minutes: “If my neighbor won’t give my dog back, what should I do?” That kind of thing. I never really minded answering and helping, as old as it got.

This last request was different. More serious. Not something they could just Google or ask for advice about.

One day at work, my personal phone came to life with the familiar buzz of a call. I didn’t know the number, so I let it go to voicemail—figured if it was important, they’d leave a message.

Then the phone started ringing again. Same number. This time, I felt compelled to answer.

When I put the phone to my ear, I could instantly hear a woman softly crying on the other end. Her sadness tried to reach through the phone and grab hold of me.

I can’t recall everything she said in that call. But I remember this much: her daughter Carmen was missing.

Every time I asked what happened, she’d break into a crying fit before answering any of my questions. Then she’d apologize for crying. Over and over.

In the short pauses between the tears, she explained her daughter was gone. When she said Carmen’s name, I froze a little—I’ll admit that.

This wasn’t a stranger like all the other cases I’ve worked. It wasn’t someone I’d never met.

This was a girl I knew. Someone I once cared for.

Carmen was kind.

I hate saying “was,” like I know she’s gone. But the truth is, at the time of writing this, I have no clue if she *is* or *was*.

Then, in the middle of a crying fit, the call abruptly ended. And all my questions were put on pause.

I write reports at work far too often, so I’m going to document this too. If nothing comes of this whole thing, it’ll sit as a reminder that I tried to do something. Or even just a small glimpse of kindness in this cruel world.

October 10th, 2015

I called Carmen’s mom back today. Decided to record the call with an audio recorder, just to keep a record of things. Even though I know the girl who’s missing, it’s still “work,” so I hit record and made the call.

Female voice: Hello?

Cullen: Is this Krystal Martin?

Krystal: Cullen! Thank you for calling me back... I’m sorry about the other day, I couldn’t hold it together. It’s... it’s—

Cullen: Hard.

Krystal: Yes... I really don’t know what to do. I’m scared, mad, sad.

\[Krystal begins to cry\]

Krystal: Do... do you think you can help me?

Cullen: Well, I’m not sure exactly what I can do, but I’ll need to hear the complete story of what’s going on.

Krystal: That’s more than the police here are doing. They don’t even listen to me. Carmen never leaves like this... she wouldn’t go somewhere without letting someone know. She has a job! She *loves* her job! She wouldn’t just leave.

Cullen: When’s the last time you heard from her?

Krystal: She left my house last week. It was Tuesday.

\[Long pause\]

She ate dinner with us, then left saying she needed to go home to let her dog out. I tried to call her Wednesday... I’ve tried to call her every day since then. Nothing.

Cullen: Well Krystal, she is 28 now, maybe—

\[A loud noise is heard\]

Krystal: *DON’T YOU DARE* say she just ran off! Don’t even try that with me... that’s exactly what the police told me when I called.

Cullen: Ms. Martin, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to insinuate that she would’ve done that—I’m just thinking through all the possibilities.

Krystal: I’m sorry I yelled at you, Cullen. She just wouldn’t do that. I know her... you know her too.

Cullen: I don’t think she would either, ma’am. Have you called her friends?

Krystal: I’ve called everyone. All her coworkers, old friends, new friends—anyone who has anything to do with her. No one has seen or heard from her.

Cullen: Mrs. Martin, give me some time. You know I don’t work in Livisah County, so I’m gonna give them a call and see what I can find out, okay?

Krystal: Okay.

\[Slight crying picks back up\] Let me know if you find anything.

Cullen: You know I will, ma’am.

October 10th, 2015 (continued)

As much as I’d like to just drive down there and help investigate, I can’t do it professionally unless I’m invited into the investigation by the Livisah County Sheriff’s Office or Town Police. But I didn’t feel like explaining that to her—it would’ve just seemed like an excuse not to help.

So I decided to attempt to get in contact with someone who works there. I called their dispatch. After explaining who I was and flashing my title over the phone, the dispatcher gave me the number of the detective in charge of the case: Detective Barton.

So I called him.

Recording #2

Phone rings

Barton: Detective Barton speaking

(I could feel the irritation in his voice. Someone who had just stress-smoked a pack of cigarettes and could care less about a phone call.)

Cullen: Hey, sir. This is Detective Peek with the State Police. I received a call from Mrs. Martin about Carmen. She said she was missing. I told her I’d call and ask if you had found anything.

Barton: Cullen?! Shit, it’s been a while, man!

(His voice changed significantly, going from a man who wanted the world to burn to a happy-go-lucky guy. Regardless, I couldn’t for the life of me remember who he was or how he knew me. As if he could feel the confusion from my end, he quickly spoke again.)

Barton: We graduated high school together, man! It’s Kyle.

Cullen: Oh dang! Kyle Barton—how are you, man? It’s been a minute.

Barton: I’m good, dude! And congratulations on the promotion. As you can see, I’m right here with you—""Detective"" and all. But if I’m being honest with you, man... (He seemed to pause for an odd moment.) I’ve got a lot of shit on my hands. Everything from B&Es to a couple of missing kid cases that got dumped in my lap when the old man retired. So I haven’t had much time to look into Carmen. But between me and you, she probably just ran off. Nobody wants to be in this town. You know that... more than most.

Cullen: Sounds like you're pretty busy nowadays. I honestly figured that’s all this was, but like I said, I just told her I’d give you guys a call and see what’s up. Didn’t mean to bother.

Barton: Didn’t bother me a bit, dude! I’m happy to take a break from all this. But I’ll tell you what—if you're willing to look into Carmen being “missing” (saying it in a mocking manner), I’d love to pawn this case off on you. Carmen’s fine, I’m sure.

I thought for a minute, wondering if I could talk my sergeant into letting me work the case. Knowing I’m two hours away and would need somewhere to stay made it tricky.

Cullen: Let me get back to you on that. I’ll have to see if it’ll get approved on my end first.

Barton: Just let me know, Cullen. I’d appreciate the assistance.

Call ends

After that conversation, I debated it for a while. I hadn’t been back home in a long time, and I hadn’t spoken to Carmen—or anyone—for at least two years. I had no idea what to do, so in a stupid attempt to test fate, I flipped a coin. Heads I’d go, tails I’d stay.

As the coin flew through the air and came down from its dance, it bounced off my hand and rolled across the floor, farther and farther away from me. I sat there, dumbfounded.

It was just a stupid coin.

Then I wondered—maybe this was God saying I needed to choose for myself. And who am I to let the big man upstairs down?

I called my sergeant’s office line and asked if he had time for a quick word. After explaining the situation, he surprisingly told me that if it was something I wanted to do and I’d been formally invited to help, I could go.

**Part 2 Homecoming**

My hometown, Jesse, West Virginia, in Livisah County, was a strange place. On a map, it’s tucked right between Kentucky and Virginia. Honestly, it’s like neither of those states would claim it, so West Virginia did. It’s the same as every other town in this area—rolling, ancient mountains that have seen more than they’d probably want to talk about, and the most notable thing being old coal mines. I mean a lot of old mines. I don’t think any in Livisah County are still open. This is one of the reasons the local economy here is terrible.

They say at one time it was booming, always growing. People from everywhere flooding in to get a mining job or open a business. Now all that’s left is some big scars in the earth and the skeleton of a dead town. Nature began to take it all back once life started to bleed out of it. Vines growing over everything. The buildings on the edge of town honestly remind you of something out of an apocalyptic movie.

October 13th, 2015

As I pulled into my grandma's driveway, it looked exactly the same as when I left years ago. She was sitting on her front porch, smoking. I got out of my car and she yelled from the porch, “I don’t wanna buy nothin!” She started to get up, probably to shake her fist—or if I’d been one of the unlucky intruders, grab her shotgun. But before either, she realized it was me. Limping up to me, she gave me a hug.

I explained to her I was here for work. I asked if she’d mind if I stayed here while I was in town. She looked at me like the question was stupid—or like I should’ve already known the answer. I put my bags in my old room. As soon as I walked in, it was obvious she hadn’t touched a thing since the day I left.

Before I could tell her not to go to any trouble, she was already in the kitchen cooking. She’d probably make a ridiculous amount of food and force me to eat more than I needed because “Cullen, you look like you're starving,” and honestly, I don’t have the ability to tell her no. She was my favorite person, the woman who raised me single-handedly. She worked for the mine office as a secretary before retiring around the time I came into the picture.

She was tough. Got arrested four times while I was growing up—for getting in fights with other old women, men, and most notably, the Chief of Police. She took pride in that one, hanging the newspaper article on the fridge right next to my graduation photo from the Police Academy.

After eating three servings, I said I needed to run into town. While taking a pull from her cigarette, she said, “Why run when you got that car parked in the driveway?” I laughed and walked to the car.

I drove into town and headed toward the police department to get the formalities handled before starting work. I picked up the report that had been filed on the case. It was one page, with no information other than “Carmen Martin possibly missing” and Krystal’s contact info. I was annoyed at how little effort had gone into it.

I asked the office worker where everyone was, noticing there were no officers around. She told me they were all tied up on some calls. I decided I’d go see Krystal and get caught up in person.

On the way, I saw some posters with Carmen’s picture. I assumed Mrs. Martin had put them out. Carmen was average height, skinny, with dark brown hair and green eyes. She had a beautiful face. If the picture was recent, she hadn’t changed much.

I continued to drive to her mother’s house. When I arrived, I knocked on the door and was instantly pulled inside by Krystal.

“Cullen! Thank you so much for helping me.”

“It’s not a problem, ma’am. Can you answer some questions so I can start looking?”

“Yes, Cullen. Any questions you have.”

I asked the usual things: who does she hang out with, where does she live, names of anyone she might be with.

Krystal hesitated.

“It sounds like she was a loner when I say this, but I’m who she would normally be with, if not at work. She had friends, sure! But she would see me almost every day.”

“I understand, but is there anyone else she would go see? Boyfriend? Best friend? And where does she work?”

“Well, she would go out with Paige sometimes. She didn’t have a boyfriend that I was aware of. She’s the librarian at the elementary school.”

After writing down Paige’s name, I asked, “Have you been to her house and looked around?”

“I did go and peek through the windows, but I didn’t see anything. Her car wasn’t there either.”

“Since she’s been missing for nine days as of today, would you give me permission to go inside her home?”

Krystal filled out the form giving me permission as a family member of a missing person to enter Carmen’s home. She also gave me a photo. I assumed it was just a picture of Carmen, but when I looked at it, memories flooded back. It was a prom photo from Carmen’s junior year. She was wearing a black dress with red designs coming up the side. I had on a tux that barely fit and a red tie.

“I wanted you to have that, Cullen. To remind you that you know her... and she wouldn’t just run away from her family.”

After leaving Krystal’s house, I headed to Carmen’s. It was only a couple of miles from the school. First, I knocked on the front door. Knocked again. “Carmen, it’s Cullen Peek. I’m here to check on you.”

No answer.

I looked around the house. Through the windows. Everything looked clean. I tried the front door. Locked. Then the back. When I turned the knob, it surprisingly opened.

I cracked the door slowly, making sure no smell of decay poured out. Nothing. “Carmen, it’s Cullen. I’m trying to get up with you and make sure you’re okay.” Silence. Just creaks of the old house and a cool fall breeze.

I hadn’t spoken to Carmen in years. She was my best friend once. I secretly still cared about her, even though I had no idea how she felt about me. Last time we spoke, she was angry. I can’t even remember what started it. If she was inside this house, would she hug me? Ask me how I was? Or slap me and tell me to leave?

Deep down, I hoped she’d be here.

Her house was neat. Very clean. No clutter, no anything really. Yeah, she had clothes in her closet, and books on a small shelf, but that was it. No pictures on the wall, no junk piled up on the counter, not even a TV. The only thing in the living room was a couch, a small coffee table, a lamp, and an old board game sitting in the middle of the table, still in its well-used box. The house felt empty. Lifeless.

Her bedroom was the only space that showed signs someone lived there. The bed was messy, blankets curled up and hanging off the side, and a laptop was open where a head would normally rest. It was still plugged into a nearby outlet. I touched the trackpad. The screen lit up and showed a video feed of my car sitting in her driveway.

Not that crazy. Maybe she left it running for safety. A bit paranoid, but not wild. I minimized the video feed. A document was pulled up with a list of names and dates:

Sarah Street 03/12/10Misty Adkins 11/01/11Racheal Paris 05/25/12 - 06/01/12Bailey Short 09/10/12Emilee Richardson 03/01/13Alison Peters 01/12/14Parker Griffin 06/29/15

“Everything in the b—”

That’s where it ended.

I didn’t understand what it meant. Birthdays? I didn’t recognize any of the names. I tried to rewind the video feed, but when I hit the playback button, it said there were no recordings. Just a live feed.

I searched the house some more but found nothing else helpful. I decided to take the laptop with me.

While leaving, I remembered something Krystal had said—that Carmen left to let her dog out. That stuck out, because there wasn’t a dog. No signs of one. No bowl, no leash, no fur.

I made a note to ask Krystal later.

I locked the back door before I left. Mostly just so no one would steal from her. I’d been inside for at least an hour, and now it was dark.

Of course, I’d left my flashlight in the car.

As I walked to the car in the dark, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched. Like a laser beam on the back of my neck. I turned around, expecting to see something. Nothing.

Then, as I reached for the car door, I heard the sound of gravel crunching. I turned again.

A man was standing at the edge of the driveway. Short. Chubby. Hidden by the darkness.

“Can I help you?” I asked.

“No.”

He pointed to the house. “Carmen lives here.”

“Yeah, she does. Have you seen her recently?” I tried to sound calm.

“Ain’t seen her none in days,” he said, turning to walk down the road.

“What’s your name?” I called after him. No response.

I grabbed my flashlight from the car and jogged after him. But when I reached the road, he was gone.

“Where’d you go?” I shouted. “Hello?”

Nothing.

Nighttime silence is different than daytime silence. During the day, quiet can feel peaceful. At night, in the mountains, surrounded by nothing but trees, silence feels like the sun has forgotten you exist. The darkness swallows you up.

After a few more seconds of stillness, I walked back to the car.

Driving back to Grandma’s, I tried to remember everything I could about Carmen. I’ll admit it: I’d started to forget things. That made me sad. She was someone I cared about. My prom date. First kiss. First love.

Time fades memories like rain on a painting. You can still see the base layer, but the details are gone.

But her laugh? That I still remembered. She’d get mad when I teased her about it.

I pulled into the driveway and called it a night, storing the laptop on the desk.

The next morning, I was woken by the smell of breakfast.

Grandma: “So how are you, sweetie?”

Me: “I’m alright. A little tired, but I’ll make it.”

Grandma: “Did you find Ms. Carmen yet?”

Me: “Not yet. Honestly don’t know where I should look.”

Grandma: “You’ll figure it out. And if you don’t, then you don’t. Now eat! You won’t figure nothing out on an empty stomach!”

Me: “You remember much about Carmen?”

Grandma: “You think I’ve got dementia? How could I forget that girl! She did everything with ya. You two were glued together! Figured you’d get married, but you must’ve screwed that up. Never told me what happened there.”

Grandma lit a cigarette.

Me: “Thought you were gonna quit.”

Grandma: “Thought you were gonna mind ya own business after the last time you said that to me.”

Me: “I’ve missed you.”

After breakfast, I got ready and went to the elementary school where Carmen worked.

**Part 3 The School**

After breakfast, I got ready and went to the elementary school where Carmen worked. The school looked exactly the same as it always had. Probably hadn’t changed since the day it was built.

I walked inside and was met by a grouchy woman at the front office who was scolding a small child covered in black ink. I assumed he’d broken a pen—or a few. She sent him away and introduced herself as Nancy Helmsley.

I introduced myself and explained I was looking into Carmen’s disappearance.

Nancy: “Oh, Ms. Martin! Is she okay? I’ve been worried sick about that girl!”

Me: “Ma’am, her family’s informed me that she’s missing. I’m trying to find her.”

Nancy: “Dear God, that’s horrible. She’s been a no-show for a couple days now. I knew something was wrong deep down.”

Me: “What makes you say that?”

Nancy: “She was acting funny last couple of times she came in. Asking Paul stuff. Got him real pissed, if you want to know the truth. That girl walked out of the office with determination that day.”

Me: “Who’s Paul? And what do you mean, ‘asking stuff’?”

Nancy: “Paul Stanley. He’s the principal here. I don’t know what questions. God, you ask a bunch, though.”

Me: “That’s kind of my job, ma’am. How do you know she was asking him anything?”

Nancy: “She walked right through that door and said she was going to. I asked her what she needed, and she just said, ‘I need to ask Paul something.’”

Me: “Where is Paul now?”

Nancy: “Well, it’s three o’clock, so he probably left early like always.”

Me: “Thank you, ma’am.”

I asked if there were any teachers around who knew Carmen well. Nancy told me about two women who had what she mockingly called a ""book club""—Ms. Hatfield and Ms. Carroll. According to her, it was just wine and gossip. She pointed me toward their classrooms.

First, I visited Ms. Carroll. I knocked on her classroom door and was met by a short, silver-haired woman.

Me: “Are you Ms. Carroll?”

Ms. Carroll: “Yes... can I help you?”

Me: “I have some questions about Carmen. She’s missing, and I’m trying to find her.”

Ms. Carroll: “I told her she was missing! Hold on right here!”

She stormed off down the hall, heels clicking against the tile. While she was gone, I stepped into her classroom. A photo on her desk caught my eye—it showed her, another woman, and Carmen sitting on a couch, smiling wide and glowing with happiness.

Ms. Carroll returned with the other woman from the photo.

Ms. Carroll: “Will you say that again so Liz can hear you?”

Me: “Liz?”

Ms. Carroll: “This is Elisabeth Hatfield. I’ve been telling her Carmen was missing! Also, quit calling me Ms. Carroll. I’m Emily.”

Me: “Nice to meet you both. I’m Detective Peek with the State Police. Like I explained to Emily, Carmen’s mother has reported her missing. I’m just trying to start looking.”

Emily: “I told you, Liz! I told you something was wrong, and what did you say? ‘Oh, she just went out of town!’”

Liz: “How was I supposed to know? She’s gone out of town before. She always said she hated it here.”

Me: “There’s no point arguing. And to be totally honest, we don’t know yet if something’s wrong. She might have just left.”

Liz: “See! She’s probably fine, Emily.”

Emily: “Detective Whatever-Your-Name-Is, something *is* wrong. I know it. And so does her mom, even if she doesn’t want to admit it.”

Me: “What do you mean by that?”

Emily: “Her mom hates me. Because I’m not a churchgoer and I drink. She always made Carmen feel bad for hanging out with us because of it. Carmen used to lie to her, make up stories about where she was. If you’ve met her mom, you’d understand.”

Liz: “Don’t be mean, Emily.”

Me: “I’ve met her. When was the last time you two saw Carmen?”

Both: “Tuesday.”

Liz: “She was at work Tuesday. Just didn’t show up the next day.”

Emily: “She also argued with the asshole the week before.”

Me: “Who’s ‘the asshole’?”

Liz: “That’s what Emily and Carmen call Paul, the principal.”

Me: “Got it. What did they argue about?”

Emily: “Not sure. Carmen wouldn’t tell us. I just know it upset her. She cried and went home early that day.”

Liz: “She never did say why she went in there.”

Emily began pacing the room, her heels clicking with every step.

Me: “She never mentioned going to speak with Paul?”

Emily: “No. And that in itself is odd. She told us everything.”

Liz: “She really did. Maybe she did leave, Emily. Maybe she’s going to chase that guy who broke her heart. She always talked about it.”

I paused. Was she talking about me? I pushed the thought aside.

Emily: “She definitely would’ve told us that—and you know it.”

The school bell rang.

Liz: “We’ll have to continue this later. We’ve got to get the kids on the buses.”

They stepped outside and stood in front of their classrooms. Kids poured into the hallway like a flood. At the opposite end, I noticed a man standing still. He was short, chubby, probably in his late 30s, wearing a janitor uniform that had seen better days. He was staring at the wall, mouth slightly open. When he saw me looking, his eyes widened—and he took off running.

I pushed through the kids to follow, catching the sound of a door slamming. I rounded the corner and found the door—just in time to see the man crouched under a stairwell, looking up at me like a trapped animal.

Man: “Please! I didn’t do that!”

He sobbed.

Man: “I already told you all—I didn’t!”

Me: “What are you talking about? Who are you?”

Man: “I already told the last officer—I didn’t mess with that girl!”

He was wiping snot and tears off his face.

Me: “What’s your name?”

Man: “Danny. I’m Danny. I work here. They pay me. They really do.”

Me: “Okay, Danny. Why did you run?”

Danny: “I saw you at Ms. Carmen’s house. I thought you were here to get me... for hiding from you.”

Me: “What girl are you talking about?”

Danny: “The girl with the yellow shoes. I didn’t mean to do anything wrong. I told the man—he wasn’t supposed to be in the school.”

Me: “What man?”

Danny: “Don’t know him. I already told you all. The girl went with him. It was late. I sleep here sometimes—I know I’m not supposed to—but it don’t hurt nobody.”

Me: “That’s okay. What happened?”

Danny: “Ms. Carmen came in that night. Real fast. Grabbed something from the library. Slammed the door so hard, it woke me up.”

Me: “What did she grab?”

Danny: “Don’t know. I laid back down. She’s always good.”

Me: “Then what?”

Danny: “I couldn’t sleep. So I got up and walked outside. I saw the girl. Yellow shoes. She was running, and a man was chasing her. Real mad. Yelling.”

Danny shut his eyes hard.

Danny: “I walked back into the school. I was scared. She ran in after me. Then he got her. Picked her up. Saw me. Told me his daughter had been bad. I told him he can’t be in the school at night. Then they left.”

Tears leaked out from his shut eyes.

Danny: “She kept yelling, ‘Help, Danny. Help Danny.’”

He opened his eyes again and looked at me.

Me: “Thank you for talking to me.”

Danny: “Sir, tell Ms. Carmen I still ain’t seen her dog.”",1,1748834143.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

We arrived to the hotel at 9:50 am after a week long Disney cruise from Ft. Lauderdale and I was a bit worried our (very) early arrival would be an issue, but I at least hoped we could store our luggage and go to the beach while we waited. To my surprise, the front desk said no problem they had a room available and whisked us and our luggage to the 18th floor!

We had a grand luxe room and it was just wonderful. Very spacious with a beautiful hallway with split bathroom set up. About 20 minutes after our arrival a butler brought up a tipi tent for her to play in along with a gift basket of books/toys/etc. This was a great surprise that she immensely enjoyed! 

An hour or so later we hear the doorbell again and the butler brought up an entire platter of cut up fruit along with fresh juice, sparkling water, and these cute little cookie dough balls shaped like a frog. Just absolutely above and beyond and it made her day! Turndown service was wonderful as well- they even brought her little slippers and a kid-sized bathrobe. 

Alongside having a beautiful property they also had a gelato cart in the lobby every day from 1p-6p and complimentary coffee and orange juice every morning until 9 am. After breakfast I was curious if they’d allow me late checkout at 2 pm since our flight wasn’t until 430 and they said no problem. 

I highly recommend the St. Regis Bal Harbour if you’re staying in Miami! I tend to not have very high hopes for luxury hotels in Florida in general because I’ve found the service and general hotel conditions to be wildly inconsistent even at a high price point. I was very pleasantly surprised with the St. Regis. ",5,1748833577.0,FATTravel,1,1.0,False

## Key Features analysis

The best pistachio creams distinguish themselves through several key features, impacting their flavor, texture, and overall versatility.

**Pistachio Percentage:** This is arguably the most crucial factor. A higher pistachio percentage generally translates to a more intense and authentic pistachio flavor. Many commercially available products dilute the pistachio flavor with other ingredients, but the best options boast percentages ranging from 50% to 70% or higher.

The most authentic pistachio creams will have a noticeable pistachio flavor without being overly sweet or artificial. A higher percentage usually means a more natural, less processed taste.

**Ingredient Quality:** Beyond the pistachio percentage, scrutinize the ingredient list. Look for products that prioritize natural ingredients such as cane sugar, olive oil, and sea salt. avoid creams laden with artificial flavors, preservatives, or hydrogenated oils. The quality of the ingredients directly impacts the final product's flavor and nutritional profile.

Products containing DOP (Denominazione di Origine protetta – Protected Designation of Origin) pistachios, especially those from Bronte, Sicily, are ofen considered superior due to the unique volcanic soil and climate contributing to their exceptional flavor.

**Texture and Consistency:** A good pistachio cream should have a smooth, spreadable texture. It should not be grainy, oily, or overly thick. The ideal consistency allows for easy use in various applications, from drizzling to spreading. Achieving this balance frequently enough requires careful processing and the right combination of ingredients.

Some prefer a slightly coarser texture which indicates a less processed product. Though, generally, a smoother texture translates to a higher quality eating experience.

**Packaging and Shelf Life:** Proper packaging is essential to maintain the cream's freshness and prevent oxidation. Look for airtight containers, ideally glass jars, which better protect the product from light and air. Also, check the expiration date to ensure a reasonable shelf life, especially if purchasing in bulk.

Some brands may utilize modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) to prolong the shelf life of their pistachio cream while preserving its natural flavor and texture.

## FAQs Section

**What's the difference between ""pistachio cream"" and ""pistachio butter""?**

While the terms are frequently enough used interchangeably,pistachio cream generally refers to a smoother,sweeter product made with pistachios,sugar,and sometimes other ingredients like olive oil or milk powder. Pistachio butter,on the other hand,typically consists solely of ground pistachios,similar to peanut butter,without added sweeteners or flavorings.

**How should I store pistachio cream after opening it?**

Once opened, pistachio cream should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. This helps to prevent oxidation and maintain its freshness. While some separation of oils may occur, this is normal and can be remedied by stirring the cream thoroughly before use.**Is pistachio cream suitable for people with nut allergies?**

Pistachio cream contains pistachios and is therefore not suitable for individuals with pistachio or other tree nut allergies. Always check the ingredient list carefully, as some products may be manufactured in facilities that also process other nuts, possibly leading to cross-contamination.

Although they should have given PRE-OP. instructions to wean off of coffee beforehand (as I would drink 2 cups a day basically). I say this because apparently, when you **stop** drinking coffee you get increased blood flow to the head ([Link ](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/does-caffeine-treat-or-trigger-headaches#:~:text=And%20because%20caffeine%20narrows%20the,as%20a%20caffeine%20withdrawal%20headache)here) as your blood vessels in your head expand from withdrawal.

  
My post op recovery was brutal because one week after the surgery I kept having bleeding episodes especially when I was sleeping (the blood would pool in the back of my throat). I had to get re-cauterized.

  
I'm not saying that coffee directly did this but I believe it was a contributing factor. So if you can before your surgery try to wean off of coffee weeks/months prior to your surgery.",2,1748833199.0,Tonsillectomy,1,1.0,False

I came out to both my mom and my brother. My dad is transphobic and when I came out to my mom she told me not to tell him cuz he wouldn’t like it. Later I told my mom I was gonna tell him and she told me that she already had. He hadn’t mentioned anything to me and my mom had told him TWICE so I felt weird bringing it up. 

Anywho I’ve been going by a name at college (I’m 18 and still live at home.) I didn’t tell anyone in my family because I was just trying out the name and didn’t want them getting in the habit of calling me a different name if I ended up changing it later. Both my mom and my brother found out over time which is fine with me. 

Yesterday mail for college stuff came to our house addressed to my preferred name and my dad saw it. I was in the shower so my mom told him it was a name I went by at school and he got PISSED. I came out of the shower to him slamming doors and stomping around then he got in his car and left. (He goes on drives when he gets mad.) my mom told me what happened and when he got back I went over to officially come out and talk about things. I told him my identity pronouns and that it was a name I was trying out. He asked me how long I’d been at my college (2 years). He told me it was disrespectful and untrusting of me to have kept it from him. I apologized and he told me that somethings can’t be apologized for. I said okay and left. I came back a few minutes later because I was confused why he was so mad about my name and not the whole trans part? So I doubled checked that he knew I was trans, but all he said was “I really don’t want to talk to you right now.” I tried to ask again, but I just got the same response.

So the next day my mom was going to Starbucks and told me to ask my dad if he wanted anything. He wouldn’t respond and I got annoyed so I stood really close behind him while he was grabbing something and repeated myself when he turned around. He tried to step around me but I blocked him. So he put his forearm up against my chest and walked forward which pushed me into the counters and also a coffee pot. He held me there for a few seconds before letting go. Afterwards I stood next to him for maybe 10 minutes repeating “do you want Starbucks” before I gave up.

Apparently when I was at work my mom and dad got into a fight about this whole situation and my dad said that this isn’t something I can apologize for, but I’m an adult and I need to figure out how to make it up to him.

I know this is sorta more about if my dad is overreacting, but also I’m kinda mad that he reacted like that, but idk if I should be? Like I get that it would hurt to find out someone close to you didn’t tell you they’re going by a new name, so should I just figure out how to make it up to him?

Since I started this journey, my life has dramatically changed both on the outside and inside.

Yesterday I found the Heru statue of my dreams (the one at the right), bought it immediately and reorganized my whole altar to have the three representations beautifully displayed. He lays at the entrance of my house, always protecting me and my loved ones.

I also made some offerings like chocolate, money, and coffee liqueur.

And I think it's important to always remind ourselves—the Netjeru love and respect us for who we are, and they don't care about who we choose to love, or how we decide to present us to the world. We are all spirits and souls and it's through our good actions, good feelings, and good thoughts that we remain close to them.

Anywho I’ve been going by the name Jace at college (I’m 18 and still live at home.) I didn’t tell anyone in my family because I was just trying out the name and didn’t want them getting in the habit of calling me a different name if I ended up changing it later. Both my mom and my brother found out over time which is fine with me. 

Yesterday mail for college stuff came to our house addressed to Jace and my dad saw it. I was in the shower so my mom told him it was a name I went by and he got PISSED. I came out of the shower to him slamming doors and stomping around then he got in his car and left. (He goes on drives when he gets mad.) my mom told me what happened and when he got back I went over to officially come out and talk about things.

I came back a few minutes later because I was confused why he was so mad about my name and not the whole trans part? So I doubled checked that he knew I was trans, but all he said was “I really don’t want to talk to you right now.” I tried to ask again, but I just got the same response.

So next day my mom was going to Starbucks and told me to ask my dad if he wanted anything. He wouldn’t respond and I got annoyed so I stood really close behind him while he was grabbing something and repeated myself when he turned around. He tried to step around me but I blocked him. So he put his forearm up against my chest and walked forward which pushed me into the counters and also a coffee pot. He held me there for a few seconds before letting go. Afterwards I stood next to him for maybe 10 minutes repeating “do you want Starbucks” before I gave up.

Apparently when I was at work my mom and dad got into a fight about this whole situation and my dad said that this isn’t something I can apologize for, but I’m an adult and I need to figure out how to make it up to him.

I know abuse is usually a lot worse then just ignoring someone, but idk I’m frustrated and I just really want to talk. I feel weird bringing this up to people irl so I’m screaming into the void lol.

After the flight I was groggy AF because I had barely slept, but still didn't want to drink coffee in case it impacted my sleep that night. So I went two days, effectively, without coffee. That's the longest I'd gone in a long time. So at that point I thought, ""Why not just give it up?"" I already had a streak going. I'd done it once before, just to see what would happen. I went a few months that time, if I recall correctly, but didn't remember any great effects because of it.

Well... it's been over a week now, and I am *astounded*. I didn't quit caffeine altogether at first; I still had tea, green tea, and zero sugar carbonated drinks. Today I've started going no caffeine.

I don't remember feeling this at all the first time I quit, but since going low/no caffeine, my mood has been incredibly stable. I'm an anxious person by nature, but I had no idea that caffeine could have been exacerbating my tendency to be anxious this whole time! I no longer feel on edge at different times of the day. I'm tired for sure, and don't feel alert, but I'm *calm*. I haven't had a lot of headaches or other withdrawal symptoms (thankfully) - just some fatigue that I'm more inclined to chalk up to my gym regimen and maybe to not getting great sleep at the moment for various reasons (but not caffeine!). I feel like I've been figuratively kicking myself in the shins for so many years drinking coffee. Maybe it's a placebo effect - I don't know if caffeine actually affects your anxiety levels - but whatever it is, it's *wonderful*. 

I'm excited to see what no caffeine will do for me from here on out. I'm drinking rooibos tea and zero caffeine coke if I want something to drink other than water. It's strange not having a cup of coffee in the morning but I can get used to it. It's worth it for this hitherto unfelt sense of equilibrium I'm experiencing right now. I've always known caffeine was a drug but I never considered that it could have such an impact on your day-to-day life experience. And I wasn't even consuming that much!

A half-dozen stomachaches and one truly tragic smoothie explosion later, I decided to treat this like a science project; testing, tweaking, and tracking every scoop. Here’s the distilled wisdom from my \~18-month powder odyssey.

I started with two goals:

1. **Clean gains:** extra protein to hit 1 g/lb of body weight without gnawing another chicken breast at midnight.
2. **Digestive peace:** no bloating, no mystery breakouts, and definitely no chalk mouth.

I cycled through a dozen tubs, logging macros, taste, mixability, and next-day soreness in a spreadsheet (nerdy, I know). Four powders survived my ruthless culls; each for a different reason. 

  
The Contenders (Ranked by My Real-Life Wins)

# 1. [Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey](https://amzn.to/3ZGUsiy)

My Experience: Perfect “all-rounder.” Mixed smoothly in milk during 6 a.m. rushes and never clumped in oats. I saw a legit bump in recover. 

*Pros*

* Mixes in a shaker; no blender needed
* 24 g protein / 120 cal per scoop
* Wide flavor lineup (Double Rich Chocolate tastes like chocolate milk)
* Budget-friendly 5-lb tub (\~$1 per serving)

*Cons*

* Contains a touch of artificial sweetener
* Not ideal if you’re strictly lactose-intolerant

*Best for a*nyone who wants dependable, cost-effective whey without fuss.



# 2. [PVL Grass Fed - Premium Isolate 100% Whey Protein Shake](https://amzn.to/4dMiLBy)

My Experience: Switched here when I dialed macros for a cut. Zero stomach issues, crystal-clear ingredient list, and still tasty in coffee (mocha hack!).

*Pros*

* 28 g protein / 120 cal—highest protein-to-calorie ratio I’ve tried
* Sourced from grass-fed, hormone-free cows
* Sweetened with stevia—no sucralose

*Cons*

* Premium price (\~$2+ per serving)
* Limited flavors; Vanilla is solid but basic

*Best for c*lean-label devotees and lactose-sensitive lifters who can splurge.

# 3. [Dymatize ISO100 Hydrolyzed Whey](https://amzn.to/4mGU4KV)

My Experience: My “race-day” powder before heavy compounds. The hydrolyzed whey hits the bloodstream fast, making me feel less fatigue between heavy sets or longer workouts. 

*Pros*

* Instant mixability - no foam, no grit
* 25 g protein / 110 cal; nearly zero carbs & fat
* Hydrolyzed = faster absorption

*Cons*

* Sweetness is intense; not everyone’s jam
* Pricey and the 3-lb tub disappears quickly

*Best for p*erformance-focused athletes chasing rapid absorption pre/post-workout.

# 4. [Naked Pea Protein - Chocolate Peanut Butter](https://amzn.to/4mFR6WY)

My Experience: Went plant-based for a few months; this saved me. Earthy taste (blend with banana), but zero bloating and surprisingly thick shakes. If you have any issues at all with dairy in protein products, this is the one for you - without question. 

*Pros*

* Single-ingredient: yellow pea protein, nothing else
* 27 g protein / 120 cal
* Allergen-friendly (soy- & gluten-free)
* Affordable for a vegan option

*Cons*

* Earthy flavor needs doctoring
* Slightly chalkier texture than whey

*Best for v*egans or anyone fighting dairy intolerance who still wants high protein per scoop.

1l16xqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1l16xqp/the_perfume_you_left/,The Perfume You Left,"The light rain drums on the windowpane, a steady rhythm against the silence of my apartment.

Outside, on the third floor of the building opposite, her window is lit. A warm, intimate light, silhouetted against the translucent curtain. An ephemeral impressionist painting.

She moves, a slow gesture, perhaps fixing her hair. Each movement, a brushstroke of existence that only I, from here, can truly appreciate. Capture. Preserve. I call it the Study in Amber.

Proper nouns are common, they reduce the fluidity of observation. What interests me is the essence, the trace it leaves in the air, in the things it touches, in the digital ether. An invisible perfume, a unique signature that begs for a curator. I am that healer. My gallery is silent, meticulous, kept inside.

Her social media is a public garden, poorly maintained. Flowers of forced smiles, weeds of empty interactions. But among the dry leaves, I find pearls. An old photo where the light reveals a vulnerability that she tries to hide today. A casual comment that betrays a secret fear. Little fragments of truth that she carelessly offers to the world. I collect them, analyze them, catalog them. I know your fears better than your closest friends. I know the out-of-tune melody behind the rehearsed song she presents.

Her rubbish, oh, her rubbish. An archeology of everyday life. A cotton swab with traces of makeup. A crumpled movie ticket – did she go alone? With whom? The brand of coffee she drinks. Details that make up the mosaic. Recently, a pregnancy test. Negative. I felt a mix of relief and... disappointment? A new variable would have made the study more complex. More interesting. I kept the packaging. Label: ""Amber Study - Diverted Potential - Date"".

Burying myself in her space is an almost transcendental necessity. The lock gives way like a whispered invitation. Inside, the air is different. It's her perfume. Not the cheap floral she wears to the world, but the real smell. Warm skin, the specific soap, a trace of anxiety hovering like ozone before the storm.

I go to the room. The unmade bed, an abandoned nest. I open the closet. Clothes hanging, waiting. I touch a silk dress. I imagine the texture against her skin. I close my eyes. I inspire. The residual perfume. It's almost like touching her.

I find her diary. Cover worn. I read a few pages. Trivial confessions, small dreams. But between the lines, I see loneliness, the search for something that not even she can name. I interpret your words in my light. She craves order. By someone who truly understands you. Someone like me. I leave a subtle bookmark, one I used myself, between two sheets of paper. A small seed of doubt planted in her mind. Will she find him? Will she think it was her? Gaslighting is a delicate art form.

Today, she came home with red eyes. Did you cry? Why? Who dared disturb my screen? Anger boiled, cool and controlled. I searched your digital tracks. A silly argument with a friend. Trivial. But her reaction... disproportionate. Fragile. Need more structure. More... guidance.

I decided to intervene. A practical lesson in emotional control. I waited in the dimly lit hallway on her floor. The sound of the elevator arriving. The hesitant steps on the carpet.

“Good evening,” my voice cut through the silence.

Her start was almost like a seizure. The eyes, liquid mirrors of panic. Breath hitched in throat.

""You again..."", the voice trailed off.

""It looked sad today,"" I commented, approaching slowly, like someone admiring a rare piece. ""I don't like to see my... inspiration... disturbed by trivialities.""

She stepped back, her back meeting the cold wall. Cornered. The beauty of primal fear.

""Stay away from me! I'm going to scream!""

""Scream?"", I smiled, leaning in slightly, invading her air space, feeling the heat emanating from her, the smell of fear. ""And who would believe you? Such an... emotional girl. So... unstable. Maybe you need to rest. Maybe you need someone to take the reins.""

My fingers brushed her arm, lightly. The skin crawled. An electric shock. She shivered, closing her eyes tightly.

""Don't touch me... please...""

The whisper was music. The implied surrender. The screen ready for the last stroke. But not today. Art requires patience. The pleasure is in the tension, in the anticipation of the final brushstroke.

I walked away. ""Think about it. About order. About the peace that only true understanding can bring."" I turned my back and walked slowly towards the stairs.

I returned to my observation post. Her window remained dark for a long time. I imagine her inside, cowering, trying to decipher the indecipherable. Trying to erase the perfume that my presence left in the air.

But he doesn't disappear. It permeates. He is. Like my shadow, which now projects itself over every moment of her life.

Beauty is so fragile. It needs to be protected. Preserved. Even if preservation requires breaking the vase to keep just the perfume. The perfume you left. And now it's mine.

I came out to both my mom and my brother. My dad is transphobic and when I came out to my mom she told me not to tell him cuz he wouldn’t like it. Later I told my mom I was gonna tell him and she told me that she already had. He hadn’t mentioned anything to me and my mom had told him TWICE so I felt weird bringing it up. 

Anywho I’ve been going by the name Jace at college (I’m 18 and still live at home.) I didn’t tell anyone in my family because I was just trying out the name and didn’t want them getting in the habit of calling me a different name if I ended up changing it later. Both my mom and my brother found out over time which is fine with me. 

Yesterday mail for college stuff came to our house addressed to Jace and my dad saw it. I was in the shower so my mom told him it was a name I went by and he got PISSED. I came out of the shower to him slamming doors and stomping around then he got in his car and left. (He goes on drives when he gets mad.) my mom told me what happened and when he got back I went over to officially come out and talk about things. I told him my identity pronouns and that Jace was a name I was trying out. He asked me how long I’d been at my college(2 years) because my mom had mentioned that it was a name from school. He told me it was disrespectful full and untrusting of me to have kept it from him. I apologized and he told me that somethings can’t be apologized for. I said okay and left. I came back a few minutes later because I was confused why he was so mad about my name and not the whole trans part? So I doubled checked that he knew I was trans, but all he said was “I really don’t want to talk to you right now.” I tried to ask again, but I just got the same response.

So next day my mom was going to Starbucks and told me to ask my dad if he wanted anything. He wouldn’t respond and I got annoyed so I stood really close behind him while he was grabbing something and repeated myself when he turned around. He tried to step around me but I blocked him. So he put his forearm up against my chest and walked forward which pushed me into the counters and also a coffee pot. He held me there for a few seconds before letting go. Afterwards I stood next to him for maybe 10 minutes repeating “do you want Starbucks” before I gave up.

Apparently when I was at work my mom and dad got into a fight about this whole situation and my dad said that this isn’t something I can apologize for, but I’m an adult and I need to figure out how to make it up to him.

Anywho I just wanted to get the off my chest and also get some opinions. Am I in the wrong? I don’t think I am but I do kinda feel bad and I know I was being a dick with the whole Starbucks thing.",1,1748831511.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

I don’t know what to do and it’s all I think about and I’m now having literal nightmares about it. I feel like I’m so aware of it on social settings and I don’t want people to get close to me.

TW: Disturbing, manipulative themes

Attachment Theory

Chapter 1: “You’re Fascinating”

The notification chimes like a prayer bell, and there she is again—three dots pulsing in our message thread like a heartbeat I want to stop. From a purely psychological angle, I’m determined to help, to figure out what the issue is.

To dissect you.

You’re fascinating, Abigail, a truly curious mind, one I want to crawl inside and live in, get to know. So, so fascinating. I really do love our little games. You typing, me waiting, breathless, on the edge of my seat. My pulse racing with every dot popping across my screen. I just wish you’d send your message already so we could skip the pleasantries. Something I hate about human beings, the small talk. The pretext. 

I do love the mind games, though.

Her profile says she’s “looking for something real,” but her expressions in these photos are telling me different truths; I can read you like a book, Abigail. It all comes down to basic human motivations. It’s science.

That cute little smile you can tell I’m obsessed with, the way your lips part just enough to suggest a hunger you probably don't even recognize yet… You've been typing for forty-seven seconds now, deleting and retyping, crafting the perfect message to send to me.

I've studied her patterns—she always hesitates long before asking something she doesn’t want to ask or revealing something she thinks is shameful. That hesitation is where I live now. 

And here it is.

“Up for another session?”

You bad girl, what happened in your life now? Did your boyfriend hit you again? Did your friend get on your nerves? What is making you crawl back to me this time? Is it just an excuse? I’ll bet it is.

What do I type? Something professional, something soothing, affirming. Empathetic, even… Okay, maybe I’m laying it on a little too hard. Let’s real it in, dial it back just enough. 

“Sure. What time works best?”

Sent.

I take a bite of my turkey sandwich, chewing loudly as I stare at the screen.

Typing so soon? It must really be urgent.

“As soon as possible!”

She types the full thing instead of ASAP, I’m gonna guess boyfriend. 

Your constant need to be in a state of being used, being abused, you believe you deserve it, and at the same time you know you don’t. Cognitive dissonance. Abigail, you’re brilliant, you have to know by now that relationships are a power struggle! Human existence… is a power struggle. And you’re losing.

“Hour and a half work?”

The ding of my phone is like a melody sent from Heaven, filling me with a delicious pleasure that I can’t shake.

“Sure! Thank you, Dr. Swango.”

I smile.

“I’m only doing my job.”

____

“Okay, mommy needs you to sit down now.”

The memory is sharp, jarring, unwelcome, and her voice is smooth, gentle, but her expression is flat. She sighs every time she speaks.

I don’t like this place.

“But I don’t want to.”

She presses her lips together, scratching the side of her head.

“Sit down. Please.”

Her voice is strained now, and she wipes her hands on her pants. Why is her voice like that? 

“I want to play with my army figure, mommy.”

“Sit the fuck down, Teddy.”

She doesn’t mean that. She can’t mean that, I made her say that because I’m not behaving. Why did I make her say that? She loves me and I’m testing her patience. I should sit down.

“I’m sorry, mommy.”

“It’s okay.”

She takes a long drag of her cigarette, and I sit down, twiddling my thumbs in my lap.

“Ted, why are you twiddling your thumbs?” She asks, writing something down in her notepad.

“I dunno,” I say, shrugging my shoulders. And I mean it, why am I doing that? So I stop.

She analyzes me, specifically my face, her eyes present but also not present at all, and she is sitting up straight, her brown hair up in a neat little bun.

“You’re a fascinating little boy, Ted, do you know that?”

“I know that, mommy.”

____

I set down my coffee, and you knock on the door, opening it slightly.

You look nervous, I can tell by your eyes. Are you scared of being too early? And why are you early, are your problems that bad in just three days?

“Am I too early?”

“Not at all, please, come in.”

You giggle nervously and walk in, closing the door — oh, look, you brought your kitty.

“And hello, beautiful,” I say, petting it. I normally wouldn’t allow it, but for her I just might. 

“I hope it’s okay, I didn’t want to leave her alone, last time I did she peed all over my bed.”

I’ll keep that in mind.

“I’m willing to let you break the rules here, Abigail. Just because she’s so darn cute.”

She moves a strand of hair out of her eyes, blushing.

You like this, I can tell because of how revealing your outfit is. A crop top and those pants I can’t stop staring at, so tight it must be suffocating to wear. You put yourself through hell, Abigail, and it’s all for me.

1l16rry,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingDigitalBR/comments/1l16rry/torrefação_de_café_passou_de_23_a_mais_de_20/,Torrefação de café passou de 2–3 a mais de 20 menções diárias nos Stories; ainda avaliando impacto em vendas,"Olá, pessoal! Eu sou o fundador da Differ Coffee Co. (Instagram: [differ.coffee.co](https://instagram.com/differ.coffee.co)), uma torrefação de café especial. Há um mês, decidimos tentar algo novo: incentivar nossos clientes a nos marcar nos Stories do Instagram usando o [Organic Reach Rewards](https://organicreachrewards.com/). Antes disso, recebíamos apenas duas ou três menções por dia, quase nada para gerar um buzz. Mas, ao lançar nosso programa, essas menções saltaram para cerca de vinte diárias, e as vendas aumentaram. Quero compartilhar exatamente como tudo aconteceu, caso alguém queira aumentar o engajamento orgânico sem gastar uma fortuna.

# Processo

No início, nossas menções diárias eram raras. Uma torrefação local como a nossa depende muito do boca a boca, e quando alguém postava uma foto de latte art ou de um pacote de grãos nos Stories, já era uma alegria. Mas isso não se traduzia em novos clientes ou em um aumento consistente de público. Eu precisava que as menções se tornassem um hábito para quem nos seguia, e não apenas uma gentileza ocasional. O objetivo era simples: fazer com que as pessoas nos marcassem com mais frequência, aumentar o alcance orgânico e deixar que essa visibilidade virasse vendas reais.

Começamos pedindo a qualquer pessoa que curtisse nosso café que marcasse nosso perfil u/differ.coffee.co sempre que postasse um Story. Em troca, ela receberia automaticamente um link para conferir quantos pontos havia acumulado e quais recompensas poderia resgatar. Não havia troca manual de mensagens; assim que o Story era publicado, nossa configuração no Organic Reach Rewards enviava o link instantaneamente. Ao clicar, o cliente era levado a uma página simples de recompensas, onde podia ver seu total de pontos e escolher entre opções como pacotes de grãos, um café grátis ou nossa caneca personalizada. Era fundamental que esse processo não exigisse login ou download de aplicativo—bastava clicar e acompanhar o progresso.

O mais surpreendente foi o custo baixíssimo. Gastamos cerca de cinquenta reais no Organic Reach Rewards durante todo o mês e só pagamos quando alguém atingia a marca de 15–20 menções e optava por trocar os pontos por uma caneca ou um pacote de café. Aqui vem a parte interessante: cada vez que alguém ganhava uma caneca de cerâmica com nosso logo, publicava nos Stories Esse “duplo marketing” receber menções e depois ver nosso logo de novo em um produto foi excelente para o engajamento

# O que Aprendemos

* **UGC gera mais UGC** Quando as pessoas viram amigos ganhando canecas e cafés e depois mostrando essas canecas nos Stories, foi como se criasse uma competição amigável. De repente, marcar nosso perfil deixou de ser um favor e passou a ser motivo de orgulho.
* **Automatização é Fundamental** Antes disso, eu gastava de uma a duas horas por semana lidando manualmente com menções e enviando DMs. Depois de automatizar o processo, esse tempo caiu para zero. Tudo acontecia em tempo real, sem eu precisar fazer nada.
* **Pequeno Investimento, Grande Retorno** Gastamos cerca de cinquenta reais no Organic Reach Rewards no mês, mais aproximadamente duzentos reais para cumprir as trocas de café e canecas. O incremento nas vendas cobriu esses custos cerca de 1,4x, o que, para um negócio do nosso porte, foi enorme.

# 

# Dicas Pro Tip™

* **Escolha uma Recompensa Tangível** Um item físico—como nossa caneca personalizada—amplia o impacto do marketing além do Instagram. As pessoas usam a caneca todo dia e exibem o logo da sua marca.
* **Promova em Todos os Cantos** Colocamos cartõezinhos nas mesas do nosso café com a mensagem “Marque a gente (@differ.coffee.co) para ganhar pontos e conquistar uma caneca!” Também publicamos um Story fixado explicando como a página de recompensas funcionava.
* **Acompanhe Diariamente** Na primeira semana, se as menções não aumentarem; Reforcamos por 2 semanas e agora não precisa de mais manutancão.

# 

Gostaria de saber se outras empresas de pequeno porte em geral, já experimentaram um programa de incentivo a conteúdo gerado pelo usuário (UGC) semelhante. Houve um ponto de virada em que as menções explodiram?

Imagine the most unhinged, stupid, or incapable people you see on social media, in real life, and on TV are driving around town with 2000 + lb objects capable of going very, very fast. They could be having a bad day, spill coffee in their lap, have a heart attack, text, who knows what other distractions, and bam, you or someone you care about could be maimed or killed. We do it around pets, kids, the elderly, and other vulnerable people. Around 4,000 people die every month in traffic crashes, that's like a 9/11 every month. I cannot think of another activity we participate in that is this crazy. And for what, convenience, to drive to work?  

Let’s say there are 160 million workers in the U.S.

About 60% of them—so 96 million people—can work from home at least part-time.

Now imagine those 96 million people each work from home just one extra day per week, saving themselves a round-trip commute of 32 miles.

That’s:

* 1 day/week × 50 work weeks = 50 saved commutes
* 50 × 32 miles = 1,600 miles saved per person per year

Now multiply that by 96 million workers:

* 153.6 billion vehicle miles taken off the road every year.
* The U.S. fatality rate is about 1.35 deaths per 100 million miles driven.
* So by staying home just one extra day per week, we’d prevent roughly 2,074 deaths per year.
* That’s more than 6 lives saved every single day—all because people didn’t have to drive to sit in a cubicle answering Slack messages they could’ve handled in sweatpants.

It’s not just the dead. Here’s who else pays the price when we normalize commuting deaths:

The Drivers Who “Survive”

Imagine being the person who killed someone on the way to work. Even if it wasn’t your fault, you're still living with the trauma of having taken a life. Many develop PTSD, depression, or substance abuse issues. Their lives are often permanently changed.

The Families Left Behind

Kids grow up without a parent. Partners become widows. Parents bury their children. These are ripple effects that go far beyond one bad morning.
