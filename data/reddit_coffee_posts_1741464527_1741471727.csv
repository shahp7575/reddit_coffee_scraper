It's morning now as I type this out. I am trying to beat the sun and get into bed before the first rays of dawn slither through my blinds and confuse my circadian rhythm. The curse of night shift. My nights typically start at nine pm and end by about five in the morning. Always dependent on how sloppy the shift went. Last night was one of those nights. Our patrons I deliver to found out it was my last week and were none to happy to hear about it. A few of there reactions make me incredibly nervous for my next shift. I will have to bring another set of clothes or maybe ask Frank if I can take some extra aprons and towels, better yet an extra bottle of blessed oil, and some sigils to pin to my clothes, maybe a quirt gun with florida water steeped with wolfsbane. Or better yet a flamethrower based off how Jim reacted to me breaking the news. They all scare me but Jim, he is dangerous. Like reality shifting, perma-nightmare molecular torture for all eternity kind of dangerous. Why was he so mad? Charlene told me they wouldn't be happy. I mean every night is borderline deadly but I really didn't think it would get this bad. I don't think whatever these stains are will ever wash out. I will probably just need to burn this shirt, I cant risk another wardrobe possession and have to awkwardly explain to my landlord why my dirty work clothes are running around trying eat the other tenants, again. Sorry I'm rambling.

I work for a donut shop, circle of sugar donuts to be exact. Best coffee and maple bars in the county. We even put bacon on some of the maple bars. Our bakers really love to experiment and its one of the reasons we have been in business for so long. My personal favorite is our brown butter cinnamon glazed rings. Those things sell out fast. Don't even get me started about our coffee, but I digress.

Circle of sugar is an great place to work don't get me wrong. I really have enjoyed my time here but I just have to follow my dreams. I will be going to film school next semester in state far away from this place. I just felt like telling people about the reality of what is going on up here is something I had to do. I am leaving out the specific locations for everyone's safety. I don't want some savvy reddit detectives opening a door their not necessarily prepared to close. Though in all reality if someone dug deep enough they could figure out where the delivery route leads.

I suppose I should start from the beginning to paint a better picture. This was one of those jobs where you heard about it through a friend of a friend. They never placed ads for the position. I learned this was because they wanted someone who could directly vouch for the person applying. The interview was definitely one of the strangest I had ever been through. I showed up early in my best outfit and was greeted by the barista. She had me take a seat and offered me a free which I gratefully took. The front of the store was your typical donut shop. Bright pink boxes, shining polished display glass holding an array of sugared jewels of all shapes and sizes. A tip jar full to the brim. Bright eyed teenagers helping customers who lined out the door. Busy place, a good sign that I had chosen a decent place to work.

""Bill?"" A man in an apron stained with chocolate frosting stood with my resume in is hand.

""Yes Hello sir."" I replied

""Call me Frank, pleasure to meet you Bill lets head back to my office.""

I shook his immense calloused hand trying and failing to match his grip.

The hallway was the first indicator of how strange this job was going to get. Various symbols were painted along the walls in a red color that looked like rust. Circles in circles with zigzag patters and what looked like Hebrew written along the outer rings. Dolls made of flowers and bones hung from certain parts of the ceiling. We passed an opening to the kitchen where several bakers stood around a table chanting working a pile of dough. I swore the dough looked like it was moving around at first glance. 

""Right in here Bill.""

We turned into a small room before I could be sure. It was the size of a small closet and cluttered with papers, empty pink donut boxes still un-assembeled and wrapped in plastic, a wall of security camera monitors and a huge cabinet with two doors closed behind the chair of Franks desk. We both took a seat and went through the typical back and forth of a normal interview. Frank seemed pleased with my responses and sighed deeply before opening a drawer in his desk and pulling out a non de-script bottle of brown liquid.

""Bill would you join me in having a drink?""

I froze, the question making me stutter out ""A drink?""

I wondered if this was some sort of test. As if reading my mind Frank said ""Don't worry this is not a test I just like loosening up a touch with my new hires to get to know them better.""

I nodded, slightly nervous at the prospect. This was beyond odd but I really did want this job. The town I'm in doesn't have a ton of prospects and the pay was the best I had seen in a long time for a simple delivery job.

""Sure why not."" I said smiling in a way that probably communicated my apprehension.

He poured us both a glass and we clinked our glasses before shooting back the harsh liquid. It was whiskey I assumed. It tasted a little watered down but still burned as it made its way to my stomach.

Frank stared at me smiling for an uncomfortable amount of time. I started to think it actually was a test, one which I had failed miserably.

""Bill do me a favor can you hold out your hand for me?""

""What, uh, yeah."" I replied dumb founded before holding my hand out across the desk. Frank reached back in a nook of his clutter desk and retrieved a salt shaker. While maintaining eye contact he began sprinkling salt in my open hand before quickly pulling back as if it would explode. I began to sweat nervously thinking I had made a grave mistake and my prospective employer was a complete nutjob.

After a time he relaxed and said ""Excellent, OK good, you can just toss that down.""

""I'm sorry but that was actually all a test and you passed. We can move onto the second part of the interview your doing great Bill.""

I sheepishly dropped the salt and wiped my hands together to get the rest off.

""What kind of test? This is all a little odd sir, with all due respect.""

Frank looked down at my resume skimming through, ""To make sure your human.""

""Human? Do you get a lot of non humans applying for this job?"" I asked in a tone I regretted as soon as it came out of my mouth.

""You would be surprised. Just bear with me a little longer Bill I understand the strangeness of all this but It will make sense as we finish out. If by the end you don't want the job no hard feelings OK?""

I nodded slowly, curious as to where this was actually going.

Frank began a series of rapid fire questions.

Do I believe in the paranormal? Have I ever encountered a non human entity? Do I believe in other dimensions? What is your experience with occult practices?

I guessed I was answering correctly by Franks nods and continuous smile. We finished the questions and Frank leaned back pouring another shot.

""You don't have to have another if you don't want one Bill. It's just jack daniels watered down with holy water nothing to crazy.""

I felt curious to hear what he had to say next but also plotting my escape from this office and out into the safety of my car.

""The job is yours if you want it but I need to explain a few things. You will be assisting the bakers for the first half of your shift, frying and prepping dough. The second half will be delivering orders across and out of town in our truck. We also have a menu which is not available to the public. It caters to a clientele who need certain requirements. Our job is to keep that specific clientele happy in order to keep the public safe. We make and sell donuts here but we are also part of an organization. One which has been around for as longer than I can tell you. We help to keep the shadows satiated so to speak. Now I understand this is a lot but I can guarantee this is all very real. As I said the job is yours if you are still interested but I cant go into much more detail unless you take the position. So what do you say Bill, is this something you are interested in?""

I sat under the weight of what he had just said. I didn't feel as though he were lying. His confidence and casual manner of speaking about it all made me believe him. It was all weird but if I am being honest this was the most interesting thing I had ever come across in our boring little sleepy town. I wanted to know more, even if it all was a huge hoax my curiosity was peaked, and there was something I just really liked about Frank.

""I accept the position.""

Frank grinned ear to ear reaching out his massive hand. We shook and hammered out the details for when exactly I would start.

 Frank explained ""I will be the one to train you on the routes and our head baker Charlene will train me on the baking and prep.""

""Can you explain more about the whole shadowy organization menu thing, I mean that is a lot right?""

Frank laughed nodding ""Yes I will get more down to the nitty gritty on your first night. It would be better if we discussed it when you meet Charlene and get out on the route.""

With that I took the job. I'm going to stop here guys as the sun is definitely starting to come up and I am exhausted. I will write in more soon here. It is nice to get this all out finally. Have a good one guys thanks for reading.",1,1741471359.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

I like to bring small gifts home to give a flavor of my travels,.  So I am asking for some hints of things to being back to the USA, not especially from British Columbia but that would be an extra bonus.  I often bring snacks as that is a good small gift and people have fun with them.  I made Nanaimo bars for everyone when I came back from Vancouver Island a couple of years ago, for example.

I have a very short list so far and would love some further suggestions:

Coffee crisp

Ketchup chips

Wonderbar

Maple cream cookies (is this a brand or something made everywhere?)

Nonfood suggestions of small gifts would also be great.  I love the Indigenous Collection jigsaw puzzles and will certainly be looking for some of those for my jigsaw loving friends.  They are available in the US but better to buy them in their homeland. :)

Any other fun things that say ""Canada.""  Even ideas for more expensive items that would be suited for birthday or Christmas gifts are welcome.  My friends are mostly like me - active retired people.

Thank you!

1j6rmbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j6rmbz/feeling_like_i_just_let_her_go/,Feeling like I just let her go,"Two days before our breakup my ex and I had a talk that signaled the relationship might be coming to an end. She sensed how sad I was and kissed me and said let’s focus on us for the next few weeks. It was the most affection I’d felt from her in a while and momentarily comforted me. 

I brushed it off, but the next day I started seeing things differently and realizing how many signs there were that she’d been considering a breakup. She was clearly making an effort that day to be fun and kind and even took me out for dinner so I did my best to hide how anxious I was, dinner was good but I was surprised she never addressed our previous convo. 

After a sleepless night I couldn’t hold it in anymore, the next morning I broke out crying and explained to her how I felt like I was constantly having to prove myself and it seemed like she was no longer interested. Instead of comforting me, she also broke down crying and explained that things just didn’t feel like they should and various other reasons that she didn’t think it was working. 

I moved to a new country to be with her and part of the issue stemmed from me not really finding my place and people here and her not wanting me to stay just for her, especially since she wasn’t very happy herself. A lot of things unrelated to me were causing her unhappiness so I think I just missed my role in it. The first warning was her questioning if I really wanted to stay here 

It was a very amicable and sad break up we talked, cried and comforted each other, but after a small attempt at asking if we could just give it 3 more weeks like she had said the other day, we agreed it was too late now that the cat was out of the bag.

We’ve had no contact since then (about 8 days) per my request but planned to meet up and for her to get more of her things since we lived together. She’s been at her parents and is now on the vacation we were supposed to go on with them.

I told her I wanted to get a coffee when she returned so I could get more of an explanation and we could discuss with more words and less tears but I’m planning to just cancel that and going somewhere else when she comes to get her things.

I can’t seem to shake the feeling that I gave up too easily especially since the signs had been there before. Surely her mind was already made up but I didn’t even try. I want to fight for it so badly but I don’t want to make things any harder on her and I just want her to be happy. Should I have just sucked it up for 3 weeks and been the best boyfriend possible? Should I not cancel coffee and see if we can work it out? 

I know that’s not reasonable but maybe seeing her again be good for me, just as a way to further cement that it’s truly over, or would it be best to go as long as possible without contact?

Just posting as a rant here because it’s been a rough day and I want to speak with her so badly, apologize and try and fix it. Logically I know it’s over and I shouldn’t but i so desperately wish I had fought harder for what we had before it was too late

This is my first relationship and her second, in the beginning, having become official we were both very relaxed and very trusting with each other, this meant we didn’t clear out social media of previous talking stages/involved people, also we both went out to bars/clubs probably more than was appropriate. 

Looking back now however I realise I was out far less than her and in very different environments, the key example of this is how she would consistently go to the same bar with the same friend, over the course of approximately 2 months between September and November this happened maybe 20 times, later I learned that she had previously hooked up with someone at this bar, under the influence of this friend who was very much still out for that reason in these months, this meant my girlfriend was essentially a space saver whilst she found someone to hook up with, forcing my gf to chat to random men in these bars. She also took quite a while to clear out her instagram, longer than I did. I know she never went back with anyone or hooked up in this time since we had each others location and she lives with her parents (in a single bed😅) I am more concerned about some form of emotional cheating or maybe a kiss in this period.

Admittedly once I said I was uncomfortable with this bar and this friend immediately she stopped going and will only meet the friend for coffee in the day time now, which is rare. Obviously she vehemently denies anything ever happening and I have no proof of anything whatsoever. However we do have some trust issues as a result of her withholding information about her past, which is not that bad, however I had pretty strong opinions about one night stands that I made clear from the start so I’m sure that contributed. It took having the conversation 3 times to finally get the full story, backed by her friend who joined her and was the key motivating factor in these, telling her to let loose (after her breakup).

So am I safe to continue in this relationship, 4 months on from these issues, we are now open with absolutely everything, FaceTime daily, see each other 3-4 times a month and are fully committed. Or is this a massive red flag with secrets that I simply won’t find out about?

I got it day of & have been playing since, but even when I was watching the early gameplay footage I immediately had mod ideas I wished would be made to expand the gameplay. I'm throwing my list out here so I can see if anyone already has solutions! (Or if there are any modders interested in taking a crack at these ideas, I won't complain 😉)

1. I absolutely want more than 5 slots for how many activities can be done while a business is open. I found myself wanting to build ""strip mall""-esque builds where there are numerous stores all open at once, so 5 activities is too limited if you want folks to shop and try on clothes at one store, read/drink/eat at another, make pottery etc in the next.
2. On the same front, more options for employees would be awesome too. I'd really love to run a cafe where sims can order both meals and coffee. Maybe this is wishful thinking because it would interfere with the dine out gameplay, however I built a ""french cafe"" lot with a kitchen in the back & a coffee bar up front. It would be so cool if sims could either come in to order a coffee and read, or they could come order food, sit and have a full meal. I know there's a ""drink coffee"" activity, but there isn't an activity to ""order food"" as a customer or ""cook food"" as an employee.

Maybe this pack has left me craving even more realism in a very limited game 😅, but I'd love to do more elaborate combo lots. Especially because if you populate the world with all these expansive business ideas the sims you're playing could enjoy them too! If anyone already has suggestions on how to make these ideas possible, I'd love to hear them. Or you can just tell me to keep dreaming lol!

But I feel as though we all come from different perspectives, experiences, and personal situations.
 
And I’m curious as to getting more outside ideas on my situation, and how to find something more stable, and healthy for myself long-term.
 
As I said in the title, I’m 43. I’ll be 44 in a few months. And I feel as though I’ve just spent my entire life wandering around (I am admittedly a permanent nomad, one trait I picked up from parents who did the same).
 
I went to Midwest State College/University. And it was/is a good school, and I enjoyed my time there. I majored in political science, telecommunications, and general studies in music. I tried to also do journalism but I admittedly didn’t like the department. Graduated well, did an internship at the State House, etc.
 
But since then, I’ve just kind of bounced around. Managed an independent coffee shop for a while, loved it, lived with the owners and their kid even. But it only paid $7.25 an hour, so I needed more.
 
Went on to be a finance assistant/intern for a political campaign. Which led to being a field organizer, district director, then campaign manager on three separate state level campaigns in different states. Also did digital organizing. And waited tables and bartended in between roles. 
 
But again, I’m 43, and campaigns are contract roles for 3-6-9 months normally, and honestly they seem and feel to be far more a young, idealistic (personally I’d even say gullible) persons role for people in their 20s. People who can just work 12 hours a day calling people, knocking doors, recruiting volunteers, etc. and I’m exhausted and burnt out on that, and politics in general in that capacity. 
 
I’ve also worked in contract roles the last few years remotely as what they call “technical onboarding specialist” for a financial services firm and also for an educational company.    

Now I’m currently back in the Midwest, (I tried to escape my entire life, and did for four years, before I ended up being physically and mentally abused and harassed by roommates but that’s a separate post) living with a friend while I get on my feet again.
 
I am the assistant manager at a small pizza place that serves drunk college kids making $17 an hour. Not great, but not the worst either. And I like my coworkers, and most of the clientele quite a lot. 
 
But again, even though I don’t have family, kids, a partner, or even friends really, working 10+ hours a day 5 days a week on my feet is physically and mentally taxing and I don’t think it’s stable for me long term in either capacity either. 
 
So I just don’t know what I can do to find a permanent, non-contract role, that pays at least the $25 an hour I made at those prior roles. And ideally since the pandemic, work from home if I can, because I now find myself with severe agorophobia in some ways, and very reclusive.
 
What can I do to better my career options, and not be stuck bouncing between contract roles in politics and restaurants working 50-60 hours a week for what is not really sustainable income?",5,1741469441.0,careerguidance,3,1.0,False

I've been in search of a delicious, high-quality cup of espresso that is similar to what you might get in any cafe in Europe. 

There seems to be a trend in espresso, at least for shops, right now of making espresso that is bready/yeasty and very sour. Unfortunately, that's just not my thing.

Here are the places I have tried. Note that these ratings are NOT intended to be objective ratings of the quality of the espresso there, just how they stack up against my personal taste and what I'm looking for.

 - MOTW (7/10)
 - The Spark (7/10)
 - Indie Coffee Roasters (4/10)
 - Rivet (4/10)
 - Blue Mind (4/10)
 - Amberson (3/10)

**NOTE ON RATINGS**: I want to be clear that these are *phenomenal* coffee shops that are doing great things to keep Indy in pace with the national coffee trends, but they're just not offering what I'm looking for.

*Please* don't flame me for these ratings.

Here's an example of my experience, this one from Amberson.

Here's how they described the beans. They called this blend **Unique**.

> Origin: Hidalgo, Mexico

> Process / Variety: Natural Caturra & Marsellesa

> Roaster: Amberson Roasting in Indianapolis, IN

> We taste red fruits, baking spices & chocolate In milk: chocolate ganache & red fruits

And here are my personal tasting notes.

> Grassy and salty upfront followed by bread and mild chocolate in the middle. Not picking up any of the fruit they claim in the tasting notes. Very little aftertaste, but what there is seems…grassy. 

I mean no disrespect to Amberson or these other shops. Amberson I believe recently won a national medal for their efforts. But if they're not serving the kind of cup I'm after, all the medals in the world don't mean anything for me.",2,1741469308.0,indianapolis,3,0.75,False

It was a big one—probably 400 pounds, but it looked like a deflated balloon. Its hide sagged over the earth, limp and bloodless. It looked like something had reached inside and scooped out everything that should’ve been holding it up. No bullet holes, no claw marks. Just skin and muscle, untouched but empty.

I crouched down, gloved fingers prodding the limp flesh. The whole thing felt wrong in a way I couldn’t explain. I’ve been working as a park ranger for almost two decades. That means I’ve seen everything from drunk teenagers to people out looking to make a few extra bucks hunting out-of-season. But this wasn’t poaching.

I grabbed my radio.

“This is Ranger Powell, reporting a carcass on the north end of Crooked Pines. I’ve got a bear, adult male, no external wounds, but—” I swallowed. “It’s been deboned. Completely.”

Static hissed, followed by the scratchy voice of Ranger Gibson. “Repeat that last part, Powell?”

“I said, it’s been *deboned*.”

A long pause. “...Copy that. Sit tight. I’ll run it up the chain.”

I didn’t sit tight. No way I was sticking around with an inside-out bear. I snapped a few pictures, sent them to my supervisor, and marked the GPS coordinates before heading back toward base camp.

Crooked Pines was deep country. Real old, real quiet, the kind of place where sound didn’t carry right. This was my third season patrolling these woods; I used to be stationed further south, toward Erin Creek. I’d seen weird shit before since coming to Crooked Pines. A deer stripped of its flesh but left standing upright. Trees with fresh, gaping wounds that leaked thick, clotted sap. Once, I found a pile of elk teeth, all stacked neat in the middle of the trail like some kind of offering.

But this? God Almighty, this was something else.

I kept walking along the now-familiar path, boots crunching through dry needles, my breath puffing in the crisp autumn air. The sun had started dipping below the tree line, staining the sky a bruised purple. The trail back to camp wasn’t far—half an hour, maybe less.

I was day-dreaming about making a hot cup of coffee over the fire when I heard it.

A soft *clatter-clatter-clack.*

I stopped, narrowing my eyes as I listened.

Silence.

I turned, scanning the treeline, hand drifting to the hunting knife on my belt.

Nothing moved.

I exhaled, shook my head, and kept walking.

Ten minutes later, I heard it again.

*Clack-clack-clatter.*

Closer this time.

Like bones rattling in a sack.

My skin went cold.

I’d heard twigs snap, leaves rustle, the sharp *crack* of branches breaking under something big. But this wasn’t that. This was more rhythmic. It almost sounded musical, in a haunting kind of way.

I picked up the pace, heart hammering in my chest. The sound stayed with me.

There was no doubts about it: Something was following me.

The trees grew denser, shadows stretching long over the path. I reached for my flashlight, thumb flicking the switch—and as that bright burst of false-light came into being, I saw it.

A shape moving between the trees, just at the edge of the fading light.

Tall and spindly, made entirely out of bones.

I couldn’t tell how many. Dozens? Hundreds? The off-white marrow was twisting, shifting, clicking and clacking together like some grotesque puzzle. A human ribcage formed its chest. An elk’s skull perched where a head should be. A bear’s massive spine curved along its back, vertebrae flexing with each step. Stray pieces dangled from its limbs—deer femurs, wolf jaws, a collection of finger bones threaded together like beads.

And it was walking toward me.

I stumbled back, breath coming short. The flashlight beam wavered, casting jagged shadows as the thing took another step.

*Click.*

*Clatter.*

It raised one long, gnarled limb—part human arm, part something animal—toward me.

I bolted.

Branches whipped my face. My pack bounced hard against my shoulders. I could hear it behind me—faster now, the bone-rattle shifting into a horrible *scraping* sound, like something dry and hollow dragging itself through the dirt.

The base camp solar-powered dusk-to-dawn lights were close. I could see them flickering between the trees as the dark creeped in around me.

Then—

*CRACK.*

Pain. White-hot and searing, lacing straight up my left arm.

I screamed, tumbling forward onto my knees.

My hand—*my fucking hand*—

It was empty.

The skin still there. The muscle. The tendons. There was no blood, no wound—but the bones were *gone.*

My fingers curled inward like deflated balloons, limp and useless. I could feel the *absence.* A terrible, gnawing emptiness that went all the way down to my wrist. I turned, gasping, and saw the thing crouched low just feet away.

My bones—*my own fucking bones*—dangled from its outstretched hand, the metacarpals still threaded together in a ghostly echo of my grip.

It tilted its elk skull, as if considering me. Then it took my bones and placed them into its own arm, almost reverent, like a thief slotting stolen treasure into place.

After that…I don’t know what happened, honestly. I don’t remember getting to camp. I don’t remember getting into my tent. But I do remember the sound outside.

A slow, deliberate *clatter-clack.*

Bones settling into bones.

Building something new.

That happened...a month ago now. The doctors can’t explain it. The missing bones, I mean. I told them that I just woke up that way. Didn’t think they would believe the rest of my story. Crooked Pines is a big place. It’s a weird place. If you go there—hiking, camping, *working—*you should know that ahead of time.

1j6rfxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1j6rfxp/is_this_emotional_abuse/,Is this emotional abuse?,"I was married for several years, recently divorced. I don’t think my ex is a bad person. However, the church we were in saw men as the “final say” in everything, and women were asked to be “submissive.” My ex and I were more liberal than most on this, but it was still ultimately the belief. 

Before we got married, I became more worried about my looks. He liked my makeup to be done certain ways. On the first night of our honeymoon, he laughed at me when I came out in lingerie. He said it just didn’t fit right and he thought I was trying to be silly. It was a pretty bold choice, but this being my first time, I felt like that was not very kind. He couldn’t believe how much I held onto that experience. Often, when I was downstairs and ready to go somewhere, he would look at me with disapproval because he didn’t feel like my outfit was flattering or coordinated. I would often change. Mostly, I chose my outfits to try to please him. He would often come shopping with me and help me decide what to buy. He said he liked my style, but he always seemed like he was trying to hone it to be more like his style. 

When I would get hurt, he would suddenly get really mad and yell, though it would usually dissipate quickly. This especially happened if he had told me not to do something and then I did it (even accidentally) and ended up getting hurt. He said he just didn’t want to see me hurt. At first, he wouldn’t let me go to coffee, lunch, etc. with male coworkers because he “worried about what they might do.” Over time, he loosened up on that, but he did always want to know where I was. I turned on location sharing for a bit, but I got tired of being asked about me going to get coffee or ice cream. 

He got upset with me when I would poke fun at him around other people or say anything negative about him. He said it was disrespectful. So I stopped sharing anything negative about him. We were around my family a lot, but he didn’t like me asking them for advice on things, because he felt he should be the leader and not them. He felt they didn’t need to be involved in our decisions in that way. When I would go somewhere with someone one on one and would tell him about the conversation we had, he would ask for the exact wording I used for certain things and then get frustrated if I didn’t remember or get upset with me for saying things in a way that didn’t reflect well on him or us. Eventually, I got to the point where I felt like he was the only person who understood me, but somehow now I wonder if that might have had to do with me having to filter conversations with everyone else to match his preferences.

He would tell me that if we didn’t have sex often enough it would cause him to “stumble” and look at other women sexually. He would get frustrated/grumpy if we didn’t have sex every 2-3 days. On my period, I was ideally expected to please him in some way, even if I didn’t want to have sex. He only actually kept going when I said “no” one time, I think. I confronted him about it, and he did feel bad about it and didn’t do it again. However, he then was kind of insistent that he “wanted me to want it” but would still get frustrated if it wasn’t happening every few days. He would also still want to at least have one hand touching me while we slept, even if I told him I didn’t feel like being touched right then. He would often touch me when we were just living our lives, and it would make me jump or cringe at times.

Some friends tell me that some of the things he did sound like emotional abuse, but others would say that he was a great guy and these things are fairly normal levels of control. He did help a lot around the house, he supported me through grad school, and he was kind. But somehow these things seemed to chip away at my sense of self.

Long story short, after a series of bad fortune, and minor missteps, I lost my job last Summer. Since America, and especially Red States like mine, lacks a decent social safety net, I couldn’t afford to pay rent while I looked for a new job. I took a job in desperation so I could try to pay rent, but I was already too far in a hole, and wasn’t allowed enough time to repay my back rent. I was evicted in the middle of January. 

Since then, I’ve been working my crappy job, and trying to survive. On really cold or inclement nights, I try to rent a cheap motel. Other nights, I “sleep” outside at bus shelters or on benches a little off the beaten path. I typically get about two or three hours of sleep a night, as I keep waking up either from physical discomfort, or some random noise distraction. I usually end up falling asleep while riding the bus in the mornings. 

So many places won’t allow you to fall asleep there. Libraries, coffee shops, the mall, late night diners. Most of the time, I’m not intentionally trying to sleep in these places, but I’m so fucking sleep deprived, my brain just starts cutting off if I’m in a seated position. 

I lived in my previous apartment for 20 years! It was all lost because I lost a job of 11 years, and couldn’t find a job in less than four months, unless I’d been willing to take an even shittier job than the one I took! 

I just want a safe place where I can sleep comfortably, charge my phone, and maybe cook some food for myself, so I don’t have to keep wasting money on eating out. I want my life back!

Sierra Water on Dickerson Road is a sanctuary where community and nature intertwine. Sunlight filters through the tall warehouse windows, lighting the shelves all filled with greenery.

The scent of fresh soil lingers with subtle notes of coffee from the Forged Roasting Co. trailer parked inside.

All around there’s handcrafted ceramic pots, delicate stained glass lamps, clothing, and plants to fit any household.

At the heart of it all is owner Samantha Stremmel.

What began as a pop-up has become one of Reno’s most inviting plant shops. Stremmel’s journey to Sierra Water began long before she opened its doors.

Raised on a farm in Montana, she grew up surrounded by nature, working on her family’s organic vegetable farm.

“My mom always had plants in the house but I never really thought about taking care of them myself,” she remembers. “It wasn’t until much later that I realized how much they were a part of me.”

In 2010, after graduating from Montana State University she and her husband, Sutter Stremmel, made the move to Reno.

The couple took a bold step and purchased a foreclosed property and turned into their Sierra Water Gardens along the Truckee River.

By 2017, they were ready for a new chapter and shifted their focus on a smaller indoor plant shop instead.

Initially it was a small pop up while they opened the Wedge Ceramics Studio next door, but it quickly turned into something permanent.

“It was such a great experience, and people loved it. I knew I had to make it something more,” Samantha says.

Today, stepping inside Sierra Water is a full experience. The shop has become a space where people can slow down and browse, enjoying the beauty around them.

1j6r754,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6r754,35m MN looking to meet Hispanic/Latino guys for a ltr/ldr. (Read More),"Hey! My name is Nate and as mentioned I’m 35. I live in the US, specifically in Minnesota. I’m looking for other guys my age, or younger, for a long term/distance relationship. I haven’t really had luck when it comes to dating, so I guess I’m trying to be open and look elsewhere; despite the distance. 

When trying to date, I’m open to a variety of guys, however, I’ve found that I often “swipe right” on guys that are Latino/Hispanic. < If this isn’t you, feel free to leave a comment. Maybe I’ll be interested.

What I look for in a guy: I want someone kind, romantic, goofy, and geeky. I want someone that will hug me when I’m sad or just because they want to hold me. I want some that likes to go on vacations, find adventure, and make new memories. It would be nice if you like going out as much as you like staying in. Someone who enjoys grabbing drinks/food or cuddling up to a movie/tv show/video games. I’d like someone that care about health, but in no way do you have to be a body builder. Honestly, as long as I can wrap my arms around you and rest my head on your shoulder, I’m happy. 

Me: The kids at work keep saying I’m nonchalant. I’m not sure if that’s good or bad. Haha I’d say I’m chill, I care about others, and I do my best to just enjoy whatever life brings forward. I do try to be romantic, mainly because I want you to know that I enjoy having you in my life, that I support you, and that no matter how big or small your feelings may be, I’m gonna be, right there, at your side. I enjoy going out for coffee, grabbing food/drinks, and having game nights with friends. I also enjoy relaxing at home, watching tv and movies, or playing video games. I enjoy traveling, but don’t do it enough. I like adventure and trying new things, but I will never do anything that will involve purposely falling. Haha I don’t have any pets but if it’s fluffy, I’ll probably get along with it. I occasionally workout by lifting weights, however, I’m currently working out through doing taekwondo.

I’m attaching pics, so if you wanna get my attention I suggest you do the same or have one on your profile. Additionally, include your age plz.

I'm gonna give a little background before I ask my question.  I'm 36/M. I don't really exercise at the gym, but I walk a lot at work. I usually have a coffee every day, (although I haven't had one in a week), i drink sodas (which i've cut back on recently) and I dip zyn.  I used to drink very heavily in my 20's but haven't drank in over 5 years.  I have a long history with GAD and Panic disorder and i take 10mg of Lexapro every day for that.  All of that being said, I'm watch some people would call a cardiophobe..  For years (15-16)  I have dealt with palpitations, which I discovered from a cardiologist were PACs, which he described as benign.  I have had numerous EKG/ECGs, echocardiograms, 2 stress tests, chest X-rays, blood work, and even worn an event monitor two or three times to record any palpitations.  All i've ever got back was normal results.  

  
But just as of about a week ago I had a morning where i was experiencing palpitations that wouldn't seem to subside, which caused an avalanche of symptoms.  Anxiety, more PACs, lethargy, no appetite, rapid pulse (it got up to 145 at one point), hardly sleeping, and overall panic.  I made an appointment with my PCP and on the day of the visit she decided to give me an EKG.  Upon examining the results, she said ""this seems to be abnormal. It may even be Afib."" which of course spiraled my anxiety.  She told me i needed to visit an ER as soon as possible and so I drove straight there.  I got admitted into the ER immediately where they did a full work up on me. EKG, blood work, chest X-ray, urine analysis....and they all came back NORMAL. The ER doctor got a copy of my original EKG from the visit i had earlier with my PCP and said it didn't really look abnormal to him, which i thought was strange.  He told me that i basically should just disregard that EKG.  Anyway, I was released from the ER with a clean bill of health and since then I've just basically been dealing with fewer palpitations but the lingering anxiety is still there and I just can't shake the feeling something may be wrong.  I know an Afib diagnoses can be tricky because you basically have to catch it on an EKG as it's happening.  Can someone share some insight or advice to me on what you think could possibly be wrong or if I should try to see an EP? The not knowing is really taking it's toll on my mental health.

I put off taking prescribed Atorvastatin for a few weeks as well as exercise until a little over a month ago.  I started out with 1/2 20mg per day then eventually went full within a week and had some aches which put me back to halves.  I kind of went back and forth.  

Pretty much cut out all high fat beef, cheese, sugar, breads.  Eating mostly salads and chicken, lean beef chili, eggs on weekends, snacks like rx bar for breakfast, fruit.  I never drink anything other than water other than 1-2 drinks per week and coffee on weekends.

I have no idea how to do it right/safely.,"I have been doing 18/6 fasts for a few months ago off and on, lost about 20lbs, but I've been holding steady for weeks. I have a problem with binge eating and distracted eating from ADHD. Currently on Vyvanse but it's not helping much. I need to lose around 80lbs in the next year and a half. I've done it before no problem, but I was also 21 and had no kids. I'd like to try incorporating some 24hr fasts to try and see if I can break the constant food noise and help with my apparent addiction to sweets. I have a few questions though.

1. Would drinking things like coffee with zero calorie/zero sugar syrups break the fast? What about things like zero sugar sodas? When I was breastfeeding, I was drinking 120oz of water a day and by the end of the day I was literally choking it down because I couldn't stand the ""taste"". I'm hoping I could still incorporate the morning coffee and the afternoon Pepsi zero to help power through.

2. I see people talking about salts/minerals they take during fasts. Is there something I should get before I start and take during the day? I currently just take my meds and a multivitamin, as well as some vitamin b6/b12 and magnesium at night. Half the time I forget to take the night meds though. 

3. What is the ideal start time? I was thinking the evening but that would make the next meal late at night which I thought was the worst time to eat.

I'm definitely no noob but I've only ever done 6 hour eating windows, and I'd like to try 48 hour fasts if I can work up to it. If anyone has any insight to the binge eating/sugar addiction side of things too that would be great. ",3,1741468166.0,intermittentfasting,1,1.0,False

“For your convenience, the avenues out of the inner system are being dutifully guarded by our associates, who will keep them free of any unwanted guests until the end of our conference. “



“We will soon start serving Canadian Canned Delights and work on the Mongolian Landscaping. If, however, you decide to lower your shields and turn off your engines, we will take it as a dismissal of such frivolous formalities and delightfully accept your invitation for a more casual meeting.”



Frivolous formalities properly dismissed, the ship’s captain moves to the airlock to properly welcome the guests.



\-Greetings, most esteemed trade partners. Allow me to thank your hospitality on behalf of all my crew. It is always pleasing when we can go through a day’s work knowing we won’t have to wash anyone’s entrails of our suits.

\-Yes, Captain Jörmungandr. We’re aware of your “protocols”.

\-Oh! A familiar face, how quaint! I am, however, most embarrassed to say I do not recall your grace, Captain…?

\-Zan-Bar-Lek. We haven’t met before, but your reputation is well known.

\-Only good things, I assume?

\-Word is that if we collaborate you will leave our ship and crew alone, which is good enough for me.

\-The rumors do not deceive you, noble colleague. The sooner we can conclude our transaction, the sooner you and your shipmates will find yourselves on your merry way.

\-Sounds good… ish. Here is the manifesto.

\-Vortan beef, we’ll take that; coffee, from Starbucks Inc., you can keep that; a doctor, our one or eighty seven cancer afflicted crewmates appreciate him volunteering into our services; slaves… Uhm…

\-Problem, Captain?

\-More of a conundrum, my fellow colleague. Could you please escort us to your live cargo?

\-Are those all?

\-Yes.

\-My impression from the manifesto was of a more numerous crowd.

\-There was a disease outbreak, not all cargo made it.

\-I see. How many left?

\-We were to make an inventory when you arrived, but I estimate a hundred or so.

\-Very well. I’ll please ask you for a moment.



Through his earpiece, the Captain address his ship:



\-Captain to Quartermaster, what’s our supply situation? …

\-That’s disappointing, if unsurprising. Enough for guests? …

\-About a hundred. …

\-Air? …

\-That little… Hum… That doesn’t get us very far.  …

\-No, Sheila. We talked about this, *that* outpost is out of the question. …

\-No, no, it’s because they use too much cumin for my ta… Of course it’s because of the giant spiders! …

\-Well, good for you. I, for my part, don’t want to make friends with the giant space spiders, don’t want to go near the giant space spiders, am not setting foot on the planet of giant space spiders! …

\-Sheila, we are murderers and thieves. No one gives a flying flamingo if I’m being speciest. …

\-Can’t you just ask Merv if he can do something about the air recycler? - He turns to his fellow captain - Sorry, this will just take a minute. …

\-Yes, Sheila… NoNoNoDon’tPutHi… Hey! How’s my favorite engineer doing? …

\-You’re too modest Merv. Anyone who can make The Sims 3 run with less than three Matrioska brains is an engineer, if not a magician! …

\-No, Merv, I haven’t. I’ll look into it when I get the time. …

\-But if I “invest” in crypto, there won’t be much left for things like the food in your belly and the air in your lungs. …

\-Yes, Merv. I’m sure it will blow up any day now, but for the moment, can you get the air recycler to 100%? …

\-90% works. …

\-Then why did you bring it up?? …

\-I’ll ask. Captain Zan, would you have spare parts for a HT-α3? 

\-No, we use GX-β9.

\-No, just GX-β9. …

\-Can’t you make something out of it? I mean, most of the ship is held together by duct tape, spit and prayers. …

\-Right. Can you put the Quartermaster back? …

\-Absolutely, Merv. Looking forward to it! …

(...)

\-Sheila, please remind me to put a cowbell or something on Merv. He said he can pump the recycler up to 20%, maybe. Where does it get us? …

\-So… planet of the giant space spiders or moon of the giant horny dolphins? …

(...)

\-I’m thinking. …

\-I beg to differ! …

\-I mean, reconstructive genital surgery sounds bad, but is it really? …

\-Well, it won’t be the land of giant spiders. …

\-But I can’t “get to know them” if I never meet them, can I? And my calendar only has an opening for this in the third week post heat death of the universe. …

\-What’s with this fixation on the planet of giant space spiders? Are you trying to set me up with one of them?... You know what? Don’t answer that. I don’t need this kind of image in my head.

\-Sheila, I know slowly asphyxiating in space *sounds* bad, but on the other hand… giant space spiders! …

\-Worst come to shove, we can still go for the dolphin worl…

\-Fine! I’ll figure something out. …

\-Captain Zan-Bar-Lek, slight change of plans. You and your crew will be our most esteemed guests until your employer reimburse us the corresponding travel expenses.

\-We’re being kidnapped?

\-No, no, no. We are businessmen, we wouldn’t resort to such vile practices. You are, of course, free to decline our invitation and remain with your ship.



He turns to the crowd of slaves:



\-Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations on your acquisition of this brand new freighter! Please take a complimentary Terran stabbing stick from our associates and you’ll soon be sailing your way across the stars.

\-I think I’ll accept your invitation, Captain Jörmungandr.

While my symptoms have improved, I’m still far from normal. Before this, I was in the best shape of my life—doing weighted pull-ups, squatting 1.5x my body weight. Strength training and staying active have always been huge passions for me, so this diagnosis has been tough.

Here’s a quick summary of my journey so far, which I’m sharing in case it helps anyone else:  

* **Oct 17, 2024**: Developed food poisoning while traveling in Africa. Diarrhea for 7 days, but otherwise felt fine.
* **Oct 25**: Achilles and foot pain started. Thought it was from the travel, walking, and different footwear.
* **Oct 29**: Returned home and foot and Achilles pain persisted.
* **Nov 1**: Woke up with severe hand pain and swelling. Took Advil and Tylenol, but the pain was unbearable.
* **Nov 5**: GP appointment with bloodwork showing a CRP of \~51 and negative rheumatoid factor.
* **Nov 7**: X-ray and ultrasound revealed possible reactive synovitis. The tech suggested this after I mentioned my travel and the Monkeypox vaccine (didn’t think to mention the GI illness at the time).
* **Rest of Nov**: Persistent foot pain, started physio, had a steroid injection in my wrist. Knees started up! Pain persisted, and I could barely walk or touch my hand. Rheumatology appointment was 9-12 months out. Took Naproxen and Tylenol daily, but didn’t do much.
* **Mid-Dec**: Feet slightly improved with taping. Achilles pain gone with calf stretching. Hand less swollen but still non-functional. Knees were the worst!
* **Dec 12**: Went to Emerg, hoping to speed up rheumatology consultation. Had bloodwork and a systemic steroid injection. Discovered I was HLA-B27 positive. On-call rheumatologist agreed to see me in her clinic.
* **Dec 17**: Diagnosed with reactive arthritis by rheumatologist. Started 20 mg prednisone and 500 mg sulfasalazine (starting dose for 1 week).
* **Jan 6**: Second steroid injection in wrist.
* **Rest of Jan**: Increased sulfasalazine to 2 g. Continued to try to taper off prednisone, but every time we taper below 10 mg, symptoms flare up. Currently back at 12.5 mg. Started 6 weeks of acupuncture with PT to see if that could help calm the system.
* **February to now**: Symptoms persist but are better than Nov/Dec. Some days/weeks, feet are the worst, sometimes knees. Using hand much more but residual inflammation and reduced ROM. 
* **March 7**: Started 20 mg methotrexate weekly (injection) with goal of getting off prednisone. Continuing with 2 g sulfasalazine.
* **March 8**: Fully committing to anti-inflammatory diet, including no alcohol (maybe no coffee). Before this, very healthy diet (\~90% whole foods, a few minimally-processed products, 2-3 glasses of red wine per month).

I’m hoping methotrexate is the missing piece I need. We’ll give it a few months and otherwise consider a biologic.

Other daily things I’m doing to help:

* Omega-3, probiotic, calcium and Vit D3 (due to prednisone), PPI (for stomach), now folic acid (for methotrexate)
* Greens supplement, turmeric tea
* Gratitude journaling, physio, home yoga (Yoga with Adriene is the best!)

By late November, I started strength training again, listening to my body. My trainer and I used cuffs and cable attachments since I couldn’t use my hand until January. Now, my workouts are lighter, and I wear a wrist brace for protection. For lower body days, we use machines and select exercises, depending on my knees. I also bike at home 2x/week and walk my dog on flat ground.

I’ll update in a month on the methotrexate—knowing it can take up to 3 months to work. Stay strong, everyone dealing with ReA!",4,1741468018.0,Thritis,0,1.0,False

Again it’s one thing when people are genuinely curious how I make their drink and they’re super pumped, asking nice questions.

It’s a great way to get my 10k steps a day, as I WFH. The staff treat me like a regular and know my order etc. I’m always polite and friendly to the staff, and they are polite and friendly to me.

I’m a 47f parent of teenagers. I tried dating after separating, but it was pretty awful, so I gave up. I feel like I shut down that part of myself, in a way to protect myself. I thought that part of my life was over for good. I just concentrated on the kids, work and home. I see my friends every now and then, but we are all busy parents.

I have a very baby face. People always think I’m younger than I actually am. People always seem to assume that I’m the same age as them. A guy was convinced I was in the same class as him at school - he was 31. People in their mid thirties think I’m 35. Just giving context that someone who doesn’t know me, might not know my actual age. 

So, there’s this one barista who is cute, but I wouldn’t say he’s *gorgeous*, but he comes across as so adorable and friendly. He’s very open about his life, that’s how I know how old he is. He seems to try to make conversation with me and tell little jokes. I know that he is paid to be friendly with customers, and I could be imagining this, but he looks at me in such a way, that I just get a *feeling* that there’s something there. If you’ve ever felt that energy from someone you know what I mean.

I saw him glancing at my name on my loyalty card, which is probably normal. Little glances here and there. Again, he just might have accidentally caught my eye as it’s not a big coffee shop. 

Anyway, I’m embarrassed about the way he makes me feel. I’m a financially stable woman in my forties, and yet I find myself blushing when he looks at me, giggling at his jokes, and twirling my hair when we’re chatting.

He may just be friendly and chatting with all the regulars, and I could be in the midst of a hormonal surge or something? Or maybe he likes me and has no idea how much older I am than him?

Either way I am so ashamed of how I feel about him. I haven’t felt like this in years. A part of me wants to never ever go back to that coffee shop, and run and hide from my feelings for him. I even went to a different coffee shop, that I don’t even like, because I was too embarrassed to be around him.

Maybe he does like me? Maybe he realises that I’m old enough to be his mother? Maybe he just enjoys talking to me? I don’t know. I feel very torn between giving him my number or never going there again. I feel like he’s awakened something within me that has laid dormant for many years, and I don’t know how to cope with those feelings. 

On the other hand he might think it’s gross that a woman 20 years older than him is crushing on him. I don’t know what to think. I’m so ashamed of how I feel about him.

The concrete subcontractors poured about six weeks ago: a 5'x5' pad at each corner, except one 5'x10' pad where the two units are near each other.  Everything looked nice, nothing gave me pause - I made the guys coffee and told them they could use our restroom, but stayed out of their way.  But after the containers were placed a few weeks later, and the welder arrived to do his part, he discovered some of the pads were uneven: a difference of about 4.5"" across 40 feet.

There was discussion about breaking them up and redoing them, but the concrete guy said he could pour again on top to correct the difference.  I was uneasy about that at first, but I read that this was not unheard of and went along with it.  His guys came out earlier this week to drill and install rebar in preparation for the next pour.  I was looking at it after they left, and I'm concerned about the haphazard placement of the rebar stubs, and wondering if it's even enough.  The ones in the first photo looks evenly spaced and considered (I wouldn't know if it's enough, or not), but those in the second photo are in a different pattern and look as though one is missing, and it appears there are a lot missing in the 5'x10' in the third photo (same pad photographed from both sides).

Am I making too much of the rebar?  I've read that a bonding agent should be used between the two layers; if I inquire about this, what should I be looking for?  Or is this all f\*\*ked?...

I'm still relatively new to coffee, but i learned a thing or two so far.   
What i found with full immerson which i use most with Hario Switch, it's better to not agitate coffee too much, otherwise it will result in under extracted and only bitter coffee.  
I have two, something like medium roast bean bags, about three months old. Stored in original package (with degassing valve) and always some portion in glass container which i fill as it gets empty.

My problem wit these two started recently, when i pour water on the grinds, coffee will foam like crazy. No grind size, no water technique or temperature seems to change this.  
This is too much agitation and ofcourse it results in horrible cup of coffee.

Why do you thing this is? After like three monts from purchase? I can get if the beand were fresh...

1j6qsy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DistilledWaterHair/comments/1j6qsy2/distilled_water_shower_device_share/,Distilled Water Shower Device Share!,"This is a long one, feel free to jump ahead!

Hey all — First, big respect to *everyone* here on the journey (its absolutely not a quick fix) and to u/[Antique-Scar-7721](https://www.reddit.com/user/Antique-Scar-7721/) who is a serious pioneer and *wow* to the measured, detailed, **kind** responses that are always given! Huge gratitude as it really stabilizes the fortitude for this long-game life choice. As soon as I found this realm I immediately dove in because the rationale behind it just made so much sense.

I'm only about 2 months (and 4 washes) into my own distilled water haircare journey but I'm not looking back, as I can already see the changes and I expect it won't be entirely linear but I'm ready to put the months/years in and weather the initial lengthy rollercoaster.

***\*edit****: I'm linking to the products I reference because I personally always want to know what people are using — I don't get anything from referencing these products they're just what I used and its easiest to link to them directly. Clearly, the bots think I'm trying to benefit off of you! If there's a better way, someone let me know, I'm somewhat of a reddit lurker and not as of yet much of a poster. Now, onwards!*\*

I personally use [this Tallow Shampoo Bar](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1309897827/tallow-shampoo-bar-full-or-half-bar?ref=shop_home_feat_2&bes=1&sts=1&logging_key=41a5b739372c3173e1465b141bce7b55864d083e%3A1309897827&variation0=3324073648) in conjunction with [this Lanolin](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00432ID82?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1) (also for 2 months now, via the guidance in r/LanolinForHair) because I'm really aiming for the outcomes u/Antique-Scar-7721 has so thoroughly documented, and what I've seen and the logic + science behind it has me believing.

Due to the cumbersome nature of showering without a showerhead and with a ""dosed"" allotment of water, I immediately had to solve for the long-game of showering with distilled water to way to make it easeful and desirable to continue into perpetuity. Here's the hack I just developed — it may not be for everyone because each of us has our own life parameters, but for me the initial and continued $ investment is nominal and akin to buying a coffee once a week, which I don't do ;) Hopefully some part of this is helpful to someone out there — one of the beauties of the internet and reddit itself!

**> NOW HERE'S THE SHOWERING HACK:**

I sprang for [this Portable Battery Powered Camp Shower](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IFHFJXI?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) and holycow does it WORK for taking an actual shower with distilled water. I showered this way for the first time ( my 4th distilled hair wash) last night and was frickin ELATED at how efficient the experience was compared to distilled washing my hair with a squirt bottle, shivering in the shower or leaning my head over a sink wrapped in a towel dripping water everywhere. Again, big respect for the pioneers straight crushing it out here... but I just had to find another way to make this sustainable XD. The camp shower comes with batteries charged, but feel free to fully charge it ahead of time — it comes with a cord so its rechargeable via USB. Some people may balk at the ""electronics in water"" situation but I'm familiar with aquatic pumps for aquariums and this is literally just a battery operated version of that, so don't fear putting it in the water (just cover up the charging port, as the design entails).

**> YES, I heated the water before pumping it through the camp showerhead, so I even had a hot shower.** Straight luxury.

2.5 gallons allows for about 2-3 minutes of showering (I didn't actually time this so I'm estimating, but I'll time it next time and will make an update) but its really all the time I needed to thoroughly rinse my hair out after shampooing. I take a body-shower every night before getting into bed and cover my hair with a shower cap, so this camp shower method isn't for regular body-showering persay but just for when I wash my hair, which right now is about every 1-2 weeks (and yes I'm acclimating, but perhaps that info is for a farther-along post). My hair is to the middle of my back and somewhat fine, but even with the length the quick shower is enough to get the suds fully rinsed.

**> Here's my workflow:**

I snag a large 2.5 gallon distilled water jug for about $6 at my local grocery store (Sprouts) or the distilled jugs at Target work fine too. I first fill my electric tea kettle to capacity with about 7 cups (\~.5 gallon) of distilled water and set it boiling. I then pour nearly the rest of the distilled water into a clean/dedicated 5 gallon bucket, which I have set in the shower. I leave roughly another .5 gallons of distilled for a second round of boiling ( just under a gallon total of boiling water really gets things toasty), but the temperature control is up to you.

*Be careful with your ratio of boiling water... too much and you absolutely can burn yourself. Less is more, especially when you're used to being colder with an alternative distilled method! You also don't have to let your kettle boil the full length, just once you see it get rolling and you know its hot but not necessarily at a full boil.*

Once I've added two rounds of hot water to the bucket, I touch-test the water to make sure its safe, and get in the shower with the camp shower in hand. The pump-end goes in the water in the bucket and I hand-held the attached showerhead.

Again, I only got a few unknown minutes of water with 2.5 gallons, but it was great water pressure and more than enough time to fully rinse the shampoo out of my hair. You must turn the pump off before the water runs below the pump's intake so that it doesn't pump air, so you'll actually have a fair amount of water leftover (that you can save) so we'll say it actually uses about 2 gallons total to work properly. I dumped remainder water in the bucket over my head as a celebration at the end because I was properly excited n\_n but you do you ;)

I (f30) has an older bff (f40). I’m single, she’s a wife and a mother and she has frequently gone to parties with me. Sometimes she’d disappear when we were out at the local pub and told me the next day that she just went home early without saying goodbye. 

Her marriage has been rocky for a couple of years now and she’s blaming her husband for not pulling any weight in their marriage and not trusting her. She gets angry at him not trusting her and then she comes to me and complain about his “trust issues”. 

A couple of months ago, she and I went to a party and suddenly rumours got spread and questions got asked. People asked me if my bff went home with some guy (unknown to her, my class mate and friend) and if she is a cheater or not. People started talking about her having a history disappearing from parties and go home with other men alone. After questions asked my way, I finally confronted her about it. She was short in her answers but said she went home with this friend of mine just for coffee as an after party in the middle of the night. Keep in mind that she has always asked me a million questions if I’ve ever had something going on with a guy. Which is why I was somewhat hurt that she didn’t want to share anything about that night. I also concluded that she knew my views on that would not align with hers so she rather keep it on the low so I wouldn’t tell her my opinion. 

Meanwhile she keeps complaining about her husband and his trust issues towards her, while still text with this dude she went home with that night. 

Fast forward and she and her husband are now separated, the kid is taking it okay, she still blames her husband for everything and is now bringing home this guy she met that night a couple of months ago. 

I feel bad for her husband whom has been repeatedly told that he has nothing to worry about and that there’s no new guy. I also feel bad for the kid whom is spending his first weekend at his dad and she is already dragging in a new man. Imo, keeping the dialogue and hanging out at his place several times and lying about it to the hubby, is cheating. And that does not align with my values at all, which makes me question how I proceed this. Do I say something? Do I keep quiet? Her husband has been out for literally two weeks and the first opportunity she gets, she brings home this friend. Idk, it just doesn’t sit right with me because I have been on the other side of cheating and the betrayal I would feel if it was me, would be huge.. 

Sooo any advice?

1j6qm6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1j6qm6u/new_to_bluecollar_work_m30s_how_to_care_for/,"New to blue-collar work, M30s, how to care for myself and body?","I've largely always done desk work or studies as an adult. The last time I worked where it was physically demanding was as a kid/teenager helping my grandparents on their small garden work, helping to haul hay, or for my home, occasional short term projects like reshingling the roof, or a woodworking project. Now, I'm working at a plant and the work is certainly more physically demanding, but not to a degree that even I can't handle. I'm 6', at 150lbs and don't workout to any significant degree - starting this job has had its share of aches and pains. 

I've upped my calorie intake between 2-3k per day, get at least 10k steps in a day at work. It's long hours of 12hr shifts being on my feet most of the day, with 8s on weekends from time to time, lifting anywhere between 30-60lbs periodically throughout the day. I'm mostly feeling it in my wrists, which is more an ergonomics issue in some cases with what we do from day to day, but the lifting contributes. 

Before at my prior job, I could easily get 10hrs sleep and still feel tired. Now I can't seem to get more than 5-6hrs everyday as I just wake up immediately. I guess the physical activity certainly lets me get to sleep faster, and in general I feel more rested as I'm not as mentally exhausted and I'm getting a great deal more physical activity in, versus when I was sitting at a desk all day. 

The money nets me easily 3x as much as as what I was earning before, so I intend to spend a little in terms of improving my quality of life (I've slept on an army cot for longer than I care to admit, so the first big purchase is a proper bed and mattress). But beyond that, I'm not sure what else I can opt for that could help in improving my day to day. 

I pretty much cook all of my meals and pack lunch/dinner to work everyday. Sometimes breakfast if I'm not being lazy, which usually is just some oatmeal. I don't eat a lot of protein, mostly veg and rice and at most 6-8oz of meat per meal. Mostly water all day, with coffee in the morning and occasionally a soda with my packed meals.

But beyond sleep and diet, I can't think of much else that I could opt for. I can't bother with new shoes, as the old adage goes with spending on things that separate you from the ground, as you can't wear your typical footwear in the plant (ESD, fire/explosion risks). I have though gotten a new set of my favorite boots, but I don't get many opportunities to wear them 😹

Any recommendations on other things I could consider? I take a b-complex vitamin when I remember to, but beyond that nothing else other than what I eat. I hope to start hitting the gym at some point once the schedules simmers down, as I'm sure it'd help in building more strength over time, but I pretty much only have time to shower, sleep, cook, and prep for work with the 12s I'm working.

Now to the story yesterday one of the managers decided that after 4 years of employment she's going to move on and the GM decided to have a small going away party for her with some food, snacks etc. A newly promoted supervisor asked what she's planning on going to and she responded that she'll be a part time batista until she can find a good full time job, which I happened to hear and after getting some food along with snacks.

Cause it was at the end of my shift my parents arrived as soon as I was done and didn't have time to eat my food, I just quickly got my stuff ready and left, my mom asked ""why didn't you pack extra food for us to eat too?""

Me: cause it's a small party for my coworker, the GM only made enough for whoever can come for some quick food.

Note this isn't the first time they've done this and would always insist I order food for them while I was at work, not to mention during rush hour too and acting like I can just order food all day for them to eat, but whenever I told them ""just come over here and get a table to order whatever you want instead."" Nope they just kept pestering me during my shift and I ended up losing my job due to their pestering, not to mention the fact that we also moved to a new house too not long after I was let go.

Mom: well where are they moving or working at now?

Me: I don't know she just said she'll work at a coffee shop a few doors down from the theater.

Mom: oh why don't you ask her to refer you to that job too?

I was mad cause I kinda knew she was going to say this and just assumed I should get a better paying job but have no experience in, I glare at her while my hands was gripping the paper plate of food and metal microwaveable bowl, you can say I'm tempted to fling it at her from the backseat but cause I'm hungry and a better person I didn't fling it at her. Instead I responded with ""I don't even have experience in making coffee, I just know how to make a basic pot of coffee.""

Mom: well you can learn can't you.

I just stopped responding cause if I did I'd end up snapping at her or possibly fling my lunch bowl at her, luckily I've got only a few weeks left to wait before I can move into my apartment that I got approved for and finally get my own peace and quiet, my parents don't know about it and I just gave them the idea that I'm apartment hunting.",1,1741466851.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

I still get caught up in the idea of slow dances in the kitchen, handwritten notes, and feeling like you’re someone’s favorite person.

Am I overreacting for wanting a divorce?","I just found out that my husband spent $10,000 on Pokémon slabs that he said were for Christmas and my birthday. I’m physically shaking. I had no idea he was spending that much. I assumed maybe $500 to $1,000 at most. When I checked our bank account and credit reports, I was shocked. 

11 years together….

I called him, and he admitted to spending $10,000. The worst part is that these were not even cards I wanted or collections I am into. It was a nice thought, but I was not thrilled by them. To top it off, he completely forgot my birthday on the actual day. He did not say anything until halfway through the day, did not get me a card, flowers, coffee, or anything at all. Even when I suggested we celebrate over the weekend, he made no effort.

Financially, we are struggling. Our mortgage is $10,000 this month because of property taxes and home insurance. Our house is on the market, but it is not selling because of the high price tag; it’s already marked at the lowest we can go with no profit. We had just paid off all of his credit cards in December, bringing them down to 9 percent utilization so we could focus on paying off mine. My credit card debt is from necessary home repairs like replacing an electrical panel to prevent a fire and I had been putting groceries on there to protect our cash for mortgage payments, not random purchases.

At this point, I blocked his number and told him I want a divorce. He has always had a problem with saving money, and I feel completely disrespected and steamrolled especially given our financial situation.

The Metro is my preferred for the more formal look indeed office like messenger bag shape. I just worry that with a rigid laptop and the notebook/paperwork in there might not be a big enough internal space for a food flask (it is a little wider diameter than an insulated coffee cup and a little taller too). I know that thee borough will fit it because it hass greater depth and is just one cavity. The Metro is not the same i think with two internal spaces.

So does any have a large Metro and could let me know if a 17cm tall and about 10 or 11cm diameter flassk fit in with a laptop and about 3cm thick notebook in the main compartment? That is with a laptop in the sleeve. Or can you measure the depth of the main compartment from the inside front to the inside back excluding the laptop sleeve that is. If you follow.

I will get the Metro if things fit in but if not put up with the borough. I just have no shop with them in near me. So I need to guess or find out from someone with a Metro.

**I asked ChatGPT I**  
*""Now, how to I feel elevated emotions like gratitude, love, joy and freedom during the times I meditate und during the times I do not meditate, so I can transform according to Dr Joe Dispenza?""*  
  
**Here are its answers:**  
To feel elevated emotions like gratitude, love, joy, and freedom during meditation **and** throughout your day, you can integrate the following practices based on Dr. Joe Dispenza's teachings:

# 1. Activate Elevated Emotions During Meditation

Dr. Joe teaches that to change your energy and transform your life, you must intentionally bring up elevated emotions during meditation. Here’s how to do it:

* **Set an Intention for the Emotional State You Want to Feel:** Begin your meditation with the intention to experience a specific elevated emotion, like gratitude or joy. This sets your mind and energy in the right direction.
* **Use Your Imagination:** Imagine a moment or memory that makes you feel deeply grateful, joyful, or free. It could be a personal achievement, a loved one, or a peaceful place. **Visualize** yourself fully immersed in that moment, feeling the emotion intensely.
* **Focus on Your Heart Center:** Place your hands over your heart. **Breathe deeply** and bring awareness to the feeling of love and warmth that arises in your chest. Think of a person, event, or experience that makes you feel love or joy. Let that feeling expand and fill your entire body.
* **Amplify the Emotion:** As you meditate, **intensify** the emotion. Feel it spreading through your body like warmth, light, or energy. Imagine that emotion growing stronger, rippling out into the field of possibilities, and filling your surroundings with that energy.
* **Change Your Breath to Elevate Your Emotions:** Breathe in deeply, focusing on drawing in the emotion you want. As you exhale, imagine releasing any negative emotions or stuck energy. By controlling your breath, you can manage the flow of your emotional energy.

# 2. Experience Elevated Emotions Outside of Meditation

Dr. Joe emphasizes that living in a state of elevated emotions requires you to condition your body to feel these emotions not just during meditation but in your daily life. Here’s how you can integrate them into your routine:

* **Create Emotional Anchors:** Use a **physical gesture** to anchor the elevated emotion. For example, every time you touch your heart (as you did in meditation), allow it to trigger a sense of gratitude or love. Over time, this gesture will help bring you back to those elevated feelings whenever you need them.
* **Gratitude Journal:** Begin and end your day with a **gratitude practice**. Every morning, list things you are grateful for. Write with detailed, emotional engagement. The more you feel the gratitude as you write, the more you will condition your mind and body to feel it even outside meditation.
* **Shift Your Focus During Difficult Moments:** In moments of stress or negativity, pause and shift your focus. Instead of reacting with the usual fear, frustration, or anxiety, intentionally bring in an elevated emotion. Ask yourself: **What can I be grateful for in this moment?** Focus on something in your life that fills you with gratitude, love, or joy, even if it’s something small.
* **Embody the Emotion Throughout the Day:** Throughout your daily activities, **remind yourself to feel love, joy, and freedom**. When you’re talking to people, moving through your day, or even just walking, notice how you can hold these emotions. You might say internally, **“I am love. I am free. I am joy.”** The more you practice this, the more these emotions become second nature.
* **Use Visual and Auditory Cues:** Surround yourself with things that **trigger elevated emotions**. Play music that makes you feel joyful, watch movies or shows that inspire love or freedom, or look at pictures that remind you of moments of joy or gratitude. Over time, these cues will help you embody these emotions outside of meditation.

# 3. Release Negative Emotions

Dr. Joe emphasizes that in order to experience the elevated emotions, you need to **release negative emotions**. If you're stuck in past patterns or emotions, they will interfere with the flow of elevated states.

* **Observe Your Emotions Without Judgment:** When a negative emotion arises, observe it without judgment. Rather than getting caught up in it, step back and notice it. Remind yourself that you’re in control of how long you stay in that emotional state.
* **Let Go of Emotional Attachments:** You might be attached to old negative emotions due to past experiences. Dr. Joe recommends **releasing these attachments** by mentally affirming that they no longer serve you. **Let go of the old self** and step into the new identity of a person who lives in joy, love, and freedom.

# 4. Condition Your Body to Feel Elevated Emotions

Your body can be conditioned to feel elevated emotions through regular practice, repetition, and conscious effort.

* **Practice Emotional Rehearsals:** Every morning and night, **rehearse the emotions** you want to feel in your meditation and in your life. For example, sit quietly and feel joy in your body as you think of something joyful. Hold that emotion as long as possible.
* **Use Your Environment to Help Condition Your Emotions:** Surround yourself with people, activities, and environments that promote these elevated feelings. **Choose to be around things that make you feel light, positive, and free.** Whether it’s spending time in nature, listening to music, or talking to a friend, these can all reinforce your emotional state.
* **Create a New Identity:** As you feel these elevated emotions more often, you begin to **condition your body** to ""know"" that it can feel joy, love, gratitude, and freedom in any situation. Begin to **believe** that you are a person who naturally experiences elevated emotions. This transforms how you respond to your daily environment.

# 5. Living in Elevated Emotions

After integrating the above practices, you can begin to live in elevated emotions. This is not just about feeling good in meditation but about creating a new way of being.

* **Live from the Heart:** Begin making decisions from your heart, not from fear or past conditioning. When you approach life with an open heart, you’re more likely to experience **love, freedom, and joy**.
* **Trust in the Flow:** As you practice feeling elevated emotions regularly, you will notice that life begins to flow with greater ease. You’ll naturally start attracting experiences that match your elevated emotional state.

By consistently practicing these techniques both in meditation and in your day-to-day life, you will begin to **reprogram your subconscious mind and body** to live from a state of elevated emotions, making transformation possible and sustainable. Dr. Joe Dispenza teaches that when you **change your energy** through emotions, you are creating a new future for yourself—one rooted in love, freedom, joy, and gratitude.

**I asked ChatGPT I**  
*Can you give me 10 examples of stories of daily life of when a human being would likely to feel a sense of gratitude?*  
  
**Here are its answers:**  
**1. Waking Up Healthy and Safe**

A woman wakes up in the morning, feeling the warmth of her bed and the gentle sunlight filtering through her window. She stretches, realizing she is pain-free and well-rested. As she gets up, she takes a deep breath and feels **grateful for simply being alive, healthy, and safe**, knowing that many others might not have that privilege.

# 2. Finding the Perfect Parking Spot in a Busy City

A man is running late for an important meeting, and the city streets are packed. Just when he thinks he’ll have to park miles away, a spot opens up **right in front of his destination**. He breathes a sigh of relief, smiling to himself, and thinks, *Wow, what perfect timing. Thank you!*

# 3. A Stranger's Unexpected Kindness

A woman at the grocery store realizes she forgot her wallet just as she’s about to pay. Embarrassed, she starts putting her items back, but the person behind her smiles and says, **""I’ve got this—pay it forward someday.""** Her eyes well up as she thanks them, deeply moved by the simple act of kindness.

# 4. Catching a Beautiful Sunset After a Long Day

After a stressful day at work, a man decides to take a walk in the park. As he sits on a bench, he notices the sky painted in breathtaking hues of orange, pink, and purple. In that moment, he forgets all his worries and feels a deep **sense of gratitude for nature’s beauty and the peace it brings.**

# 5. Coming Home to a Warm Meal

A college student, exhausted from classes and work, comes home to find that their roommate has cooked dinner for them. The comforting smell fills the air, and they feel **grateful not just for the food, but for the care and thoughtfulness of someone who looks out for them.**

# 6. Receiving an Encouraging Message Just When It’s Needed

A woman is feeling down, doubting herself after a difficult conversation at work. Just then, she receives a text from an old friend saying, **""I just wanted to remind you how amazing you are. Keep going!""** She smiles, feeling **grateful for the unseen forces of love and support in her life.**

# 7. Finding Money in an Old Jacket Pocket

A man is putting on his winter coat for the first time in months when he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a $20 bill he forgot about. He laughs to himself, feeling a **sense of unexpected abundance and gratitude for life’s little surprises.**

# 8. Hugging a Loved One After Time Apart

A mother welcomes her child home from college with a long, tight hug. As she breathes in the familiar scent of their hair, she feels **grateful for the moments of closeness, for the love they share, and for the simple joy of being together.**

# 9. Laughing Until It Hurts

During a casual night out with friends, a joke lands so perfectly that the whole group bursts into uncontrollable laughter. Tears roll down their faces as they catch their breath. In that moment, they feel **immense gratitude for the gift of laughter, connection, and the joy of simply being with people they love.**

# 10. Feeling the First Sip of Morning Coffee

**Fast, short and very effective NLP techniques to get rid of negative thoughts & pictures**

**Italian love**

* See, hear or feel that negative thought/ picture / voice appear in your mind and give it some Italian love with a back hand slap.
* Then see that negative thought cry, while holding its slapped cheek, run back into its room, close the door and staying in its room forever.
* Which of your future negative thoughts would you like to give some Italian love?

**Sexy Strobes or Catch & Choke (not sure which name is better haha)**

* When a thought/ image/ sound occurs in your mind, grab it in your mind.
* And if you like it rough, choke that f\*\*\*er like you would choke a BDSM fetishist.
* Then shrink it down to the size of a penny and let it blink black and white extremely fast and say ""brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrt"" (like machine gun fire) in your mind or out loud.
* Finally, throw it way back into the distance, until it disappears completely and lights up like a shining star/ dot at the end of the universe.
* Like in Pokemon, where the bad guys get blown away into the distance.
* Now, how much of your negative future shit can you catch & choke & let it blink black and white in the next minute?

**Cultured Catch (same as Catch & Choke just less sexy and for prude people only) (I'm kidding)**

* Grab that thought and throw it way into the distance or hit that thought with a baseball bat from the get-go
* see it explode like fireworks on New Year's Eve and
* know now that these fireworks are shining bright in celebration of you
* having already banished your old self from your current life and
* your new self has already emerged and is already stabilizing in your new life right now.
* PS: I'm not kidding.

**Banana Boss**

* I forgot the instructions, so I will write how this played out for me. This will be enough for you to visualize it yourself.
* Picture a naggy boss/ wife/ husband or whomever is being naggy with you.
* As the person gets naggy notice 8 mischievous monkeys jumping out of the next room or corner and coming into his direction.
* Now, how many monkeys do you need to order on amazon prime now to re-adjust how you see some people at your environments?
* NEVER EVER tell the other person or anybody else that you did picture this.
* It might hurt the other persons feelings and it won't be good for your relationship.
* One monkey jumps him at puts a banana in his mouth.
* Two monkeys shove a chain, made out of bananas, over his head.
* Three monkeys throw one banana each onto him and he begins to juggle them bananas.
* One monkey strikes the ground with his whip ordering him to dance in a circle, while juggling the bananas.
* One monkey jumps on one of your shoulders and touches you with his elbow like bro and says ""This asshole. Look how stupid he looks"" while laughing and pointing at him.

I am 43M and I've been in a relationship with 45M for 22 years. We own a cat, two ducks, and 4 chickens.

Last night my boyfriend asked me to feed my ducks and to save some for our chickens. This is my job, every night I take care of all the pets. I defrosted the food and put a couple handfuls into a bowl usually on the bench for the cat biscuits. See footnote.

I fed the chickens out of it (I washed it first) and then put it down and played games, went to bed. 

My boyfriend woke me up at 7am asking me where I put the bowl. I wandered out pretty out of it due to just waking up, turned the corner, and grabbed the bowl from the top of a box in the doorway of the lounge. Not exactly obvious but definitely in sight of the kitchen. I'd put it down and instantly forgotten about it. 

He asked me why I'd moved it and what was in the bottom of it. I said the remnants of corn, and he asked why I used it when I don't usually and I didn't have a good reply. He raised his voice and said that if I'm tempted to do things late at night that I don't usually, I should not do them. 

I was confused by the tone, and asked him if he was angry because it was a change to his routine. He got very angry (in my understanding of anger) and started shouting that the f'ing cat was meowing loudly, and shouted a nasal ""MEOW MEOW, etc"" for a bit. He then said the lack of a bowl meant he had to deal with that before his coffee, and told me to feed the cat because he was sick of me f'ing up his mornings. He then walked away. I washed the bowl, fed the cat, and headed back to bed. I took my meds and waited until I could process the events and post with a clearer head. 

This isn't the first time. Far from it, and despite me asking him that he not wake my up if it's not an emergency, he has often woken me up, sometimes at 6am, because I've used his fork or drunk out of a jar (at night any container turns into a potential vessel. I've drunk from a jar lid before, I'm a mess lol). Every time because it's before my medication I just get up, do it, and go to bed. Regardless of if he swears at me, shouts at me, I just do the thing and go back to bed. I once asked that he not swear at me just because of a fork and he just mockingly said ""meh meh meh"".

Now I imagine that everyone's just going ""regardless of who's at fault, break up with him!"" But 22 years. 7 pets. And a HOUSE. We've got a mortgage, and it's since having a mortgage that he's really upped the anger. I've only been diagnosed with ADHD for 5 years and I genuinely thought I'd improved a lot especially over the day. But he'll occasionally call me retarded, and he will only acknowledge the ADHD when it's to prove a point of me doing something without thinking. 

But genuinely I wonder if I should just be focusing more on improving my behaviour. If I don't touch the bowl, the fork, the jar, then there's no source of the anger. I could be trying harder maybe? 

I know it's a hard question to get answers for, because I could be unreliably narrating and you don't have the other side, but how much of this should I be putting on me? My other friends who're married don't seem to yell at each other for moving a bowl, and I'm not naive enough to think they never make mistakes. But the sheer list of things I get in trouble for makes me think that it's just 22 years of him putting up with it and he's reached breaking point and I should be trying harder instead of just going ""I'm never going to be perfect, cut me some ADHD slack"" as an excuse. It doesn't feel like an excuse but I guess excuses never do. 

Endnote: the cat has a dual bowl for biscuits and meat. There's another bowl to tip the uneaten biscuits into while we wash the old meat out. That biscuit bowl was missing. ",1,1741465557.0,AITA_Relationships,6,1.0,False

Need recommendations for motility supps and supps for increasing acetylcholine!","As the title suggests, I quit 3 substances at once a week ago…Vyvanse (only taken for 4 months), Zyn (6 years), and coffee/caffeine (12+ yrs). 

***This is important to note, I started getting constipated the last 2 weeks of taking the Vyvanse at a higher dose (50mg) while still doing nicotine and caffeine. I thought to myself that perhaps 3 stimulants was causing extreme dehydration, hence the constipation even though I was drinking 2-3 L daily with electrolytes. 

Since coming off of the substances, I have had hardly any withdrawal symptoms…only slight fatigue that is manageable and slight fogginess HOWEVER, the one symptom I am at absolute wits end with is debilitating constipation from a paralyzed gut leading to slow motility. Don’t tell me to drink more water or eat fiber or exercise or eat prunes or eat this or take mag citrate. I’ve tried prescription strength laxatives that don’t work and trust me, I can guarantee I have tried any folk remedy/food/OTC & RX laxative you can think to mention to no avail. Linzess works only occasionally and that’s why I have concluded my gut is paralyzed due to low acetylcholine and yes low motility and constipation are symptoms of low acetylcholine production which makes sense given that all 3 stimulants were in some way affecting my acetylcholine which is responsible for digestion and peristalsis. Without the stimulants, everything feels paralyzed abs the only way to have a bowel movement is to use an enema. Obviously, this is not sustainable long term and I’ve was it can take weeks to months for acetylcholine receptors to recover after writing stimulants.

""Leah, you'll make new friends, you'll get a new boyfriend. We need to do this sweetheart. Change is good"".

I didn't want new friends and I didn't want a new boyfriend. My gran wasn't Tommy's biggest fan. Always insisted something was off with him, didn't like the feeling she got when he was around.

He was my first boyfriend, slightly older but only by three years. But that didn't matter. He had a car, the brightest blue eyes I had ever seen and he was nice to me.

I knew I would make new friends. I would leave regardless if I wanted to or not. I would move on and get on with my life but leaving them behind wasn't my biggest worry.

""My mom's here"". I whispered.

""Sweetheart, your mom's in here"". She placed her hand over my heart. ""No matter where you are or where you go your mom will always be with you"".

I knew she was right but being here, living in this house, it made me feel closer to her.

""How about some hot chocolate and we can watch the sunset?"".

""I'll grab a blanket"".

Another reason why I didn't want to leave. Most nights we'd come out here and watch the sunset. It was kind of our thing. The beach was my favourite place to go. It was my safe space.

Kicking off my shoes I placed the blanket on the sand before taking a seat. The view was beautiful. Staring out into the water a sigh fell from my lips. I would never have this again. Sure, they had beaches in Texas but not this beach and not this view.

""It sure is beautiful"".

""Tommy, what are you doing here?"". I got to my feet.

He shouldn't be here. We said our goodbyes already. Him being here was only making it harder. I looked around for my gran. She tolerated him for my sake but she wasn't his biggest fan. And by that, I mean she really didn't like him.

""We can't leave it like this Leah. I can't believe I'm never going to see you again"". He slipped his arms around my waist. ""I don't want you to go"".

I bit back my tears. I would miss him. We had become inseparable over the last few months.

""You shouldn't have come. You're only making it harder"".

""I'm sorry baby"". His grip around my waist tightened. ""I love you Leah, I love you so much"".

A voice clearing caught my attention. My gran was back.

""I'll see you again. That I can promise you"". He placed the softest kiss on my lips before turning and walking in the opposite direction.

Glancing down at the ring on my right index finger a sob fell from my lips. A promise ring he gave me 6 months into our relationship. He was special, he was good and I was never going to see him again.

""Leah?"".

""I'm okay"". I dried my eyes and cleared my throat. I couldn't dwell on not seeing him again. Her mind was made up. We were moving and it was happening in the morning. ""I need to finish packing"".

Goodbye Florida, hello Texas.

...

We could have flown to Texas but no my gran wanted to drive. A little sightseeing on the way.

20 hours we had been on the road for. Stopping every so often for gas and food. My legs were numb, my bum was numb. I couldn't wait to sleep tonight.

""Texas isn't so bad"". She smiled. ""We're about half an hour away. Go get some coffee"".

I looked around. It may not be bad but it wasn't home. I wasn't sure it would ever become my home.

Heading inside I went straight for the coffee machine. Caffeine was life, I couldn't live without it. As I fixed two cups the door chimed and instantly the hairs on the back of my neck stood.

A strange sensation washed over me; I felt a little dazed but weirdly enough it felt nice. Then I felt it, a presence behind me. My heart rate picked up, the palms of my hands starting to sweat.

This was weird.

Straightening my shoulders, I put the lids on both cups, took a deep breath and turned around.

No one was there.

I frowned. I felt someone or I was that tired I was losing my mind.  Sighing I made my way to the cash register. Today had been a long day.

""Large or regular?"". The girl asked. Her smile bright, contagious even that I couldn't help but smile back.

""Regular and these"". I grabbed a pack of twizzlers opening them right up. I had the biggest sweet tooth. ""Sorry"". I grinned. ""Sweet tooth craving sugar"". Suddenly embarrassed I handed over my money and lowered my head.

Great first impressions.

""That's alright. I'm Alanna"".

""Leah"". Taking my changed I lifted the cups.

""New to town?"".

""That obvious?"". I chewed my bottom lip.

""City girl?"".

""Florida"".

Again, the hairs on the back of my neck stood. The feeling from earlier returning. Only this time I felt hot, flustered even, the feeling of being watched crept in. Maybe I was coming down with the flu.

""I have a feeling you'll like it here. You'll fit right in"". She winked.

Making a face I shrugged. Only time will tell but something was off about this place. From the minute I stepped inside I could feel it.

""How you do not have cavities I'll never know"".

Chapter 2

Closing the car door, I grinned. She knew how much I was addicted to sugar. Passing her coffee, I glanced back at the gas station as we drove away, 4 guys were stood outside staring directly after our car.

Yeah, because that wasn't odd.

""I like sugar"". I grinned sticking another twizzler in my mouth.

""You won't be saying that when your teeth fall out"". She turned onto the highway picking up speed. ""How are you really feeling about all of this?"".

""Ask me again in a month"". I couldn't bring myself to tell her because I didn't want to upset her. She thought this was the best thing for us and I was going to try and make it work.

""I know you weren't big on the idea of moving but I think you'll love it here. All I'm asking is that you try and make it home. Texas is beautiful, the people are friendly and I think we'll fit in perfectly"".

I would give her the benefit of the doubt. I would try but that's not to say it would be easy. Making new friends was, starting over again was hard.

""I'll try but please don't push it on me"".

As the car began to slow down, I became aware of my surroundings. Trees, trees, and more trees.

""Are we living in the forest?"". I asked.

Laughing she placed her hand on my knee and squeezed. ""This is just the road we take. We'll be there soon"".

""Where are the-…"". I paused when houses started to appear.

A street.

""We live in the middle of nowhere, great"". I didn't have a car which meant I was restricted on what I could do. Our new house was located in the middle of nowhere. How was I supposed to go out?

Did any buses run through here?

Sighing I ran a hand down my face as the car came to a stop. I looked up at the house and smiled. The front bedroom had a balcony, just like my old one.

I was in awe.

The house from the outside looked beautiful. A little old and it looked like it had been empty a while but nothing a little love and care couldn't fix.  Maybe living here wouldn't be so bad afterall.

""It needs some work but I had to buy it"".

Stepping inside my heart fell a little. Everything screamed old and out of date. The carpets, the furniture, the smell.

""I have contractors coming in a few days. I know it doesn't seem like much but we can give it a real go out here. Decorate the way we want; we can make this our home"".

She was happy and who was I to take that away from her. My thoughts were irrelevant right now. I had to think of the bigger picture, our future. I wasn't going to burst her happiness over a few old carpets.

""It seems like a quiet area. How far is the nearest beach?"".

""Missing the beach already?"". She smiled.

""I am but I can wait. Do you want me to start unloading the car?"". I was only to bring the stuff I couldn't live without. She was going to buy everything else new. Where she was getting the money from, I will never know and I dare not ask.

""Yes, and I'll see if I can get the heating working"".

No heating?

Rolling my eyes, I made my way outside. Surely it wouldn't get any worse right? With half my body inside the car I didn't hear anyone approach.

""Need a hand?"".

Wait, was that?

""Alanna?"".

""You're moving in there?"". She asked as I pulled myself out of the car. ""You bought that house?"".

I didn't like the feeling in the pit of my stomach. Was there something wrong with it? Kicking the door shut I stared at her. Something felt off about her too and I couldn't put my finger on it.

""Is there something wrong with it?"".

""No of course not it's been empty for a while. I live a few houses down but I mostly stay with my brother. He lives on the corner"".

""Why has it been empty for so long?"". I was curious.

""Not sure"". She shrugged. ""Let me help with that"". She took the box from me and made her way up the driveway. I wasn't sure if we were going to be friends or not. Wasn't sure if I liked her.

""Leah, I managed to get-... oh who is this?"". My gran took the box from Alanna.

""Alanna, she lives across the street. She was telling me this house has been empty for a while. Are you sure you made the right decision with buying it?"". I didn't want her spending all her money on a house if something was wrong with it.

""Leah"". She warned.

That was all I needed to keep my mouth shut. Once she was set on something there was nothing anyone could do to change her mind.

""Go and unpack the rest of the car. I will fix us some hot chocolate"".

""She seems sweet"". Alanna smiled as she grabbed another box.

She was sweet alright but she was also fierce and fearless.

""Thanks, I've got it from here"". I couldn't seem to figure this girl out. I wasn't sure if she was being friendly because she wanted something or friendly because we were new to the street.

""I don't mind"". She shrugged picking up another box. ""Besides my idiot brother has friends over and I'd rather not be there"".

""How old is your brother?"". I asked.

""24 going on 50"". She smirked. ""Bit of an asshole"".

""How so?"". I was digging but I couldn't help but be a little curious.

""I'm sure you'll meet him one day. Do you have any siblings?"".

""Only child"".

Making my way up the drive I tripped over my feet and fell to the ground. Box up in the air I put my hands out to stop my fall. ""Shit"". I groaned grabbing my knee. Lifting my jean leg up I pulled out the stone that was embedded in there.

""Are you okay?"".

Chapter 3

Then I heard the voices.

My hands were bloody, my knee grazed but I'd be fine. A little embarrassed but at least it was dark and no one else saw.

""Need a hand little one?"".

Little one?

""Jake"". Alanna warned.

Glancing up a gasp fell from my lips. Who was he and where did he come from? Wait why didn't he have a shirt on? Was I dreaming? I couldn't look away, couldn't break our stare.

""You shouldn't talk to your older brother like that Alanna"". He finally looked away and I felt like an idiot.

4 guys were stood outside my house shirtless.

It was freezing.

Blinking a few times, I think I may have hit my head on the way down to. Why didn't they have shirts on?

Wiping my hands on my jeans I got to my feet. Everything that was inside the box was now scattered all over the driveway. Sighing I went around picking up all my things.

""Jake, please just go away"". She begged.

He didn't. He stood staring and I was starting to feel a little uncomfortable. That soon disappeared when I noticed what he was holding.

My mom's blanket.

It was old and ragged but it was the only thing I had of hers. I didn't let anyone touch it in the fear it would fall apart. And here he was holding it like some old dishrag.

""Jake"". Alanna hissed.

I was too busy staring at the blanket. I couldn't find my voice to ask for it back.

""Leah, what's going on out here?"". She stood beside me her eyes instantly landing on the blanket. ""Young man I believe what you are holding doesn't belong to you. Give it"". Her voice was stern, it held authority.

His eyebrows furrowed, his eyes landing on mine. ""I apologise"". Handing it over I grabbed it before she could touch it.

I held it to my face my eyes closing. I didn't care that they were watching.

""Come inside the rest can wait until tomorrow. Alanna you are more than welcome to join"".

She didn't need to tell me twice.

""You girls sit, I'll sort some hot chocolate"".

""I'll be back my phones in the car"".

Opening the glove box, I retrieved my phone and made sure the car was locked. What I didn't expect was to find her brother waiting at the bottom of the drive. Tightening the blanket around my shoulder I stopped a few feet from him.

""Alanna is still inside. I'll tell her you're here"".

As I went to walk away, he grabbed a hold of my wrist and pulled me flush against him. I froze. What was he doing?

""Little one"". He growled.

I couldn't breathe.

""Please let me go"". My voice was barely a whisper.

He didn't. Instead, his grip tightened as he buried his head in the nape of my neck and inhaled deeply.

""Fuck baby, you smell like the ocean"".

I was afraid, my body rigid. I couldn't move even if I wanted to.

""You don't have to be afraid of me princess"".

I wasn't aware that I had closed my eyes but by the time I opened them he was gone.

Gone like he wasn't there to begin with.

I was officially creeped out.

Heading back inside I took the cup my gran was offering and sat on the sofa. I couldn't stop thinking about what had just happened. The way he grabbed my wrist, the way he pulled me to him. He sniffed me for petes sake. Who does that?

But weirdly enough even though I was scared I wanted him to touch me again.

""Leah, honey you there?"" My gran laughed knocking me out of my thoughts. ""Alanna was telling me she attends the school you've enrolled into"".

I had forgotten about school.

""Great, school"" Rolling my eyes I sat my cup down. I only had another 6 months and then I'd be finished. But it was 6 months of trying to fit in and not be the new girl.

""Thanks for inviting me over. I have to get home. Leah here's my number just in case you need anything"". Taking it from her I smiled. I knew I was a little sceptical about her before but she was the only person I knew here and I needed someone. ""No need to get up I only live there"".

As I heard the door close I looked at my gran.

""She seems like a nice girl honey, maybe your first friend here. That brother of hers though, He seems like a bit of an asshole"".

I burst out laughing. I always found it funny to hear my gran swear. She was always so reserved, swear words weren't her thing.

""But a good looking asshole"". She grinned.

I had to agree with her there. He was beautiful.

""I already think he likes you"" She winked picking up my cup. ""He couldn't keep his eyes off you"".

""Gran"" I groaned. My gran was my gran but she wasn't ancient. She had my mom when she was 16 so she was still pretty young herself. People always mistook her for being my mom.

""I'm just saying"" She smiled ""Try and get some sleep I know it's not the best but you'll have a bed by tomorrow"".

""I will night gran love you"".

""Love you too sweetheart"".

Chapter 4

I wasn't tired yet. My mind wouldn't turn off. Ever since we got here everything has been weird. From the moment we stopped at that gas station. Taking out my phone I added Alanna's number to my contacts. Opening up a new message I began to type.

'Its Leah, sorry if I came across as a bitch. Didn't mean to be. New town and all that. Thanks for being so welcoming :)'

After hitting send I didn't wait to long for a reply.

'Just a little bit of a bitch lol I'm joking!! Sorry about my brother. Told you he was a bit of an ass but he does have a good heart. Anyways do you want to go for coffee tomorrow? my treat' A x'

I didn't know if I should mention what her brother did or just keep it to myself.

'Coffee sounds good :) you can fill me in on what goes on around here and what you do for fun lol'

Okay so I decided to keep it to myself.

'I'll pick you up at 11. Night Leah, Ax'

Switching my phone to silent I closed my eyes hoping I'd drift off to sleep.

..

I was crabbit.

The couch wasn't comfortable at all, my back hurt and I was in need of a hot shower and some strong coffee.

""Hot water is good to go"". My gran had been up at the crack of dawn trying to get things started on the house. First thing she did was order me a bed. I couldn't sleep on that couch another night. ""Coffee is in the pot"".

""Thanks gran. I'm going out with Alanna at 11 for some coffee. Do you need me to pick you anything up?"".

""I'll be out most of the day anyway honey. I need to get supplies and I'll do a food shop too. You enjoy your day out. How's the hands?"".

""A little sore but I'll be fine. I'm going for a shower I'll see you soon"".

""I'll leave money of the table. I'll be away before you get out"".

I didn't want to leave the shower. The water was roasting and my body was relaxed but if I wanted to be on time I had to get a move on. Wrapping the towel around my body I headed to what will be my room. It wasn't the worst, a lick of paint and some new blinds and it would be as good as new.

Opening my suitcase I pulled out some jeans, a t-shirt, my boots and my leather jacket. After drying out my hair and running my straighteners over it I grabbed my hat and scarf. Autumn was ending and winter was coming. I didn't like being cold but winter was my favourite season of the year.

Giving myself a once over I was ready to go. Hearing the honk of a car I grabbed my bag and phone and headed down stairs. Remembering my money I slipped it into my back pocket, locked the front door and walked to her car.

""Hey"" I smiled.

""Hat and scarf?"" She grinned as she pulled off down the street.

""It's cold outside and it's not that much warmer in here. Jesus Alanna get the heating on"". Don't these people ever get cold? And she was only wearing a sweater.

""Warm blooded"" She winked but turned the heating on for my benefit. ""So I was thinking we'll go for some coffee then I'll take you around the mall sound good?"".

""Sounds good and it beats sitting in the house on my own all day"".

""Your gran out?"".

""Shopping for the house. She just wants everything to be perfect for me, for us"". It was the truth. I've never wanted for nothing in life. She's always made sure I had everything I needed.

""She seems cool for a grandma"" She laughed stopping outside the coffee shop. ""It's not starbucks but it does the best coffee"".

""You had me at coffee"". Unclipping my seat belt I got out and we headed inside. It was small but it was cosy.

""I'll get the coffee you find a seat"". So I did I found us the perfect little booth in the back right next to the window. I loved people watching, I loved to know what was going on around me. As I was watching the world go by my heart skipped a beat when my eyes landed on him.

Jake.

And he was coming in here but he wasn't alone.

""I didn't know what you take so I brought everything"". Placing the cup in front of me I added sugar and some milk. I knew he was watching, I could feel him staring straight through me.

""Hope you don't mind my friend Lacey is going to join us"". Taking off her sweater she sat it on the back of the chair. I matched her movement removing mine along with my hat and gloves.

""That's cool I'm always up for meeting new people"". I made the biggest mistake, I looked over. My eyes caught his but this time I looked away straight away. I didn't like that he had a girl sitting on his lap. I had no idea why I didn't like it. I didn't even know him. I was feeling jealous and that wasn't me.

Why was I feeling like this?

""Just ignore him"".

""Huh?"" I asked my eyes connecting with hers.

""You haven't stopped looking at him since he walked in. My brother has that effect on girls Leah, please don't fall into his trap"".

""It's not that it's-...""

""Hey girls"". this mop of blond hair took the free seat next to Alanna. ""It's going to be a cold winter this year"". Taking off her jacket she smiled at me. ""I'm Lacey it's nice to meet you Leah"".

""You too"".

""I'm going to get coffee and then you can continue your story about how you're not staring at Jake"" She smirked, my mouth fell open. How did she know that, in fact how did she hear any of our conversation?

I was lost for words. Bringing my cup to my lips I took a sip. I was getting hungry and I really wanted some sugar. As if she read my mind Lacey came back with 3 chocolate muffins. My stomach rumbled at the sight of them.

""Dig in by all means"". Taking her seat both girls stared at me as I bit into my muffin.

""What?"" I moaned my eyes closing as the taste of chocolate hit my tongue. ""I'm a sugar junkie I can't help it"". Licking my lips I drank some more of my coffee.

""Oh we're going to be great friends"" Lacey winked ""Now continue talking about Jake and your staring"".

""I wasn't staring"". I huffed both girls gave me the bullshit look. ""Okay I was but it's like I can't help it. It's weird this has never happened to me before it's like I can't look away"".

""Oh god"". Lacey side eyed Alanna but it didn't go unseen. ""Got the bug already and you've only been here a day"". They both started to laugh but I had a feeling they were hiding something.

""I don't even know him and I feel jealous that he has a girl in his lap. This isn't me"". I hated it. I was never the jealous type I never have been. I wasn't that kind of girl. If I was with a boy then I trusted that he was with me and only me. I didn't see the point in being jealous.

But this was different. I don't know what was going on with me.

""Think I'm due my period"". Huffing I began to eat the rest of my muffin. Never once did I look back over there. No matter how loud they were being or how much my body wanted to I never did.

""I'm going for a refill you want another muffin?"". Alanna asked as she grabbed my mug. I wanted to eat the whole damn shop but I decided against it.

""No I'm good with just coffee"".

""He's got a good heart"". Lacey pipped up causing me to look at her. This was the second time I had heard this. I wasn't interested in him and I was never going to let myself get into that position. By what Alanna just said her brother sounds like a player.

""I'm not that kind of girl"". I shrugged. And I wasn't. I didn't sleep around. It took me a full year before I slept with Tommy.

""I know but I'm guessing you may just be what he's been looking for"". Winking at me I glanced over at him. The girl was no longer on his lap and he was glaring at me.

He looked pissed off.

""Okay after we drink these we'll go do some shopping and then we can pick up some booze for tonight"".

""What's happening tonight?""

""We go to the beach on Fridays. Drink some beer, light a fire basically just have some fun and cool off for the weekend. You in?"".

""There's a beach?"". I grinned feeling excited already.

""Yes"" Alanna looked at Lacey and then they both looked at me.

""I'm from Florida the beach was my life. You can bet your sweet ass I'm in"".

""Lets go start our weekend early then"".

Chapter 5

After spending a good few hours in the mall we had decided to head home. It was almost 5pm and they headed to the beach at 7. ""I'll see you guys soon"". As I entered the house my mouth watered at the smell of steak.

In the kitchen my gran was stood at the stove a glass of wine in her hand. The kitchen was spotless and a new cooker had been fitted.

""Something smells great"".

""I'll fix you a plate. Go get cleaned up"".

""Do you mind if I go out for a little while tonight?"". My gran had never stopped me from doing anything but I always did ask for her permission. I wanted to go to the beach but I wasn't big on the idea of leaving my gran on her own in a new place.

""As long as you're in by 2 and you're not drinking then by all means go have some fun"".

I wasn't legally old enough to drink yet but that didn't stop me from having a few. I've never got to the point where I've been wasted. I've always been careful when it came to that. I knew she knew that I drank sometimes but it was never something we discussed.

""I won't be late. Did you get everything you needed today?"". Watching as she plated my steak I couldn't wait to dig in. I was a girl that liked to eat. I loved and breathed food.

""Bed isn't coming until tomorrow I'm sorry Leah it was the quickest they could deliver. Now sit and eat"".

I could survive one more night on the couch.

""Contractors what about them?"". I wanted to know so I could be out of the house when they were here. I didn't want to be in the way when people were trying to do their work.

""Day after tomorrow"".

Cutting into my steak it melted in my mouth as soon as it touched my tongue. My gran was one hell of a cook. ""Everything is going as planned then. Hopefully shouldn't be long until we can call this house our home"".

""Hopefully not honey. I'm going to take this wine and a book to the front porch. I'll see you before you go"".

After freshening up I was stood in my room in a towel staring at my suitcase. I didn't have a clue on what to wear. What did you wear to a beach at night? Grabbing my phone I texted Alanna for some advice.

'What do you wear to a beach at night? x'

Do I wear my bikini underneath? hopefully not in that weather. But I didn't want to be the only girl there not wearing one. I was after all trying to fit in.

'Anything you want but wear a bikini underneath. It can get wild sometimes lol but don't worry we'll look after you ;) come over as soon as you're ready' A x.

Jeans were my life saver and basically the only thing I owned. I had decided on a leopard print bikini but wasn't planning on letting anyone see it. Pulling my hair into a high pony tail I wrapped my scarf around my neck and pulled my jacket on.

Now it was sneakers or boots?

Staring at my white Nikes I sunk my teeth into my bottom lip. If I wear them they aren't coming home white. Glancing at my black ones I shrugged. They'll do.

Kissing my gran good night I headed across to Alanna's house. I could hear loud music and chatter and suddenly I was getting nervous. I hadn't really thought about other people going tonight. I loved meeting new people but that didn't mean I was good at it.

Bringing my hand up I was about to knock when the door opened, Jake was stood with a beer in hand and a glare on his face. What was with the glare? I hadn't done anything to him. He was the one that put hands on me.

He was suddenly pushed out the way Alanna taking his place. ""You look good girl. Come in what do you want to drink?"".

Looking around her house I was in awe. Her house was beautiful. All open plan and full length windows at the back. You could see the forest for miles.

""What are you drinking?"" Taking my coat she tossed it onto the corner couch. Her eyes scanned over my body and suddenly I was starting to miss my coat. I had never been self conscious about my body until I met these girls.

""Leah your body is smoking. I like that this is lace, gives them a little sneak peek of your bikini underneath"". Winking at me she went to get me a drink. It felt like the whole room was now looking at me. Maybe wearing a lace body suit wasn't the best idea. It was tucked into my jeans, nothing inappropriate was showing.

Then I heard it.

A growl or what sounded like a growl tore throughout the room.

Suddenly no one was staring at me anymore. Everyone went back to minding their own business. I don't know what it was but I was thankful.

""Vodka and lemonade with a hint of lime"" She grinned as I took it from her. ""Everything okay?"". She frowned.

""I swear I heard a growl either that or I'm losing my mind"". Taking a drink I walked closer to the back windows. ""Your house is beautiful Alanna"".

""Thank you. Jake designed it along with my dad"".

""I love the windows"". If this was my house I would never leave.

""They worked hard at it. We're having a dinner tomorrow night at my parents. You and your gran should come"".

""I'll see if she's free"".

""You should come. I'll be back in a minute"".

I wasn't moving from this spot until it was time to go. I couldn't get over how stunning the view was. I bet it looked amazing in the summer too. I was starting to feel weird again. It was like I was getting hot flushes but still shivering at the same time. I don't know if going to the beach was such a good idea. I think I was definitely coming down with the flu.

Rubbing at my arms it was then I noticed his reflection. He was staring again, stood in the corner with a glass of brown liquor. It took everything I had not to turn around. The pull was starting to become unbearable and I had no idea what was causing it.

I think the best place for me right now was home.

""Finish up we're heading out"". Passing me my jacket I slipped it on but I didn't make a move to go anywhere.

""Leah are you okay?"" Lacey placed her hand against my forehead. ""You feel hot like you're burning up. Come and sit down"". Taking my hand she sat me on the sofa.

And then she froze.

""No freaking way"" She smirked. ""I knew I was right"".

""What, what is it?"".

""Nothing Leah stay there I'll get you some water. You'll feel better soon I promise"".

Sitting the glass that I had down I got to my feet. I felt slightly better but I still felt a little hot. Walking into the kitchen I heard hushed voices. I didn't want to be rude but I couldn't help but try and listen.

""You know it's rude to listen to peoples conversations"". His voice sounded rugged, deep.

I turned around my gaze meeting his. ""It's also rude to stare but you do it anyway"".

""Watch your mouth little one"". As he took a step forward I took one back. I still wasn't sure about him. I wanted to be near him but at the same time I wanted to be as far away from him as possible. He screamed dangerous.

""Leah you still up for coming with us?"".

""Yes"" I said at the same time he said no.

Lacey smirked. I glared.

""And so it begins"" She laughed but it wasn't appreciated by Jake. If looks could kill she would be dead and buried in the back garden.

I was so confused right now. These people were weird but I kind of liked them.

Hearing the honk of a car Lacey took a hold of my hand. ""Lets go have some fun before the big bad wolf explodes"". I laughed but I didn't have a clue what she was talking about. It wasn't until I was in the car ready to go that I heard it.

It was something I have never heard before in my life.

It was a howl followed by a dangerous growl. It was loud and fierce and it had me quivering, my body shaking. Looking around the car everyone had their heads bowed. Not a word was spoken.

Fear.

Pain.

Joy?

""Hey it's okay"" Lacey whispered taking my hand in hers. ""You feeling better yet?"" Surprisingly I did feel better but I wasn't in the mood anymore.

The cars hadn't moved yet.

""Lacey"".

Who was that? He sounded angry.

""Oh no"" She groaned before the door was pulled open.

""Get your little ass out of that car right now"". He hissed.

""Jack I didn't-..""

""Now Lacey"" He roared cutting her off. This guy wasn't playing around. If Lacey was smart she'd listen to him.

""Beach is off tonight guys and you can thank Lacey for that one"". As she got out he grabbed a hold of her arm and pulled her inside.

Everyone else started to disappear.

I was left sitting alone in the back of someone's car.

Guess it was time for me to go home. What got to me was the fact that no one noticed I was still sat there. That stung a little.

Chapter 6

Getting out of the car I made sure I had my phone and keys. Shutting the door behind me I glanced up at the house. What ever shit happened in there was none of my business. As I got to my front door I turned around for the last time tonight and stared at the house.

It was still early and even though I wasn't feeling that great I was a little bummed about not going to the beach. Maybe I could find it tomorrow and go in day light. Taking off my shoes I slipped off my jacket and placed it over the sofa. My gran was sat at the island in the kitchen with her book. Music was playing softly in the background.

""I thought you were off out for the evening?"" She questioned as she placed her book down.

""So did I"". I shrugged. Opening up the fridge my eyes landed on the strawberries. Taking them out I took the seat opposite her. ""I feel weird"". I couldn't explain it. Maybe I was homesick? ""Do you feel weird?"". Maybe it was being in a different town.

""You feeling a little homesick?"" She asked.

""I'm not sure. Maybe I'm coming down with something"". Taking a few strawberries I put the tub back in the fridge. Today had been overwhelming. Don't get me wrong the people I met were friendly enough but I still had a feeling something was off.

""You'll feel better once you're settled in. New bed tomorrow, contractors the day after and then your first day of school on Monday. Once you get into a routine everything else will fall into place"".

I wasn't looking forward to school but I did have Alanna so that was a bonus.

Lifting my phone I noticed I had a new message.

'Where did you go? Come back over. We're out the back, fire is lit lol it's not the beach but at least there's a toilet. Please come :) Ax'

Staring down at the message I frowned.

""What you frowning at?"" My gran asked looking over my shoulder. ""You should go it's still early and it's only down the street"".

""I don't know"".

""Leah this is your time to make more friends. Get your jacket back on and get over there. You shouldn't be sat in here with me. I'll be having an early night anyway so please go"". She wasn't giving me much room to argue.

""Okay fine but I wont be long"". Kissing her cheek goodnight I grabbed my jacket and my keys and headed down the street. These houses were massive with a lot of room between them.

It was loud.

Everyone seemed to have a good buzz around them. There did seem to be a lot more people than before. Walking in further my eyes landed on Jake. He was sat around with a group of people, everyone was hanging off every word he spoke. Not to mention the girl from the café, she was hanging over him like a bad smell.

""You came back"". Turning around I was pulled into a hug. ""You're so beautiful Leah"". Okay I think she'd had a little bit more drink than she could handle. ""Seriously you're hot. Oh god look at her hanging all over my brother. You'd think she'd take the hint"". Grabbing my hand she pulled me inside. ""Help yourself to anything. I need to pee"".

Taking off my jacket I groaned when I realised I had forgot to change.

""Well aren't you a sight for sore eyes"". He whistled. I froze.

""Excuse me?"".

""You're a hot little thing aren't you"". I couldn't help but laugh. Did he think that was actually going to work?

""That was lame wasn't it?"" He grinned. ""I'm Kane"".

""Leah"". Opening the fridge I grabbed a beer. ""Do you always speak to girls like that? and does it actually get you anywhere?"".

""Ouch"". He smirked. ""Didn't do anything for you did it?"".

""Afraid not"". I shrugged making my way back outside.

He followed.

""So how are you liking it here?"". As we both sat down I noticed we were suddenly getting a lot of attention. Everyone seemed to be interested in what we were doing. Ignoring it I took another drink of my beer.

""This is my second day here"".

""And you've already been invited to one of Jake Taylors parties"". Whistling lowly I frowned. What was that suppose to mean?

""He's a big deal in this town"".

""He's an asshole"". I grinned causing him to laugh.

""I like the way you think Leah"" Hitting his bottle off mine we fell into silence. ""So you're not his biggest fan then?"". I asked.

""Hm I wouldn't say that. I used to date his sister"" He whispered. ""But we're cool we ended things on a good note and it was a mutual decision but I still get the feeling he hates my guts"".

""With they way he's glaring at you I think you may be right"". He hadn't taken his eyes of us from the moment we sat down.

""And that's my queue to call it a night. Hopefully see you around"".

Once again I was left on my own.

""This seat taken?""

""Depends, are you going to glare at me the full time you sit there?"". Glancing up my eyes landed on his. Deep brown eyes stared down at me. It was like he could see into my soul.

""Think we got off on the wrong foot little one"". As he sat down my heartbeat quicken, my palms were becoming sweaty. The pull I had to this man wasn't right but it felt right. I wanted to be near him. I wanted to know him.

""I'm Leah"". I smiled holding out my hand.

""Jake"". Placing his hand it mine it was like something I had never felt before.""",1,1741465069.0,booksuggestions,0,1.0,False

1j6pw3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1j6pw3c/fight_or_flight_chapter_1_dreamscape/,[Fight or Flight] Chapter 1 - Dreamscape,"Jab. Jab. Uppercut. Woah, Too close. Each hit I barely avoided. Stepping back, head movement, maybe the occasional duck, but I knew I couldn't do this in the real thing. I had three more days. No, less. Two days and nine hours. Why am I thinking about this now? I should focus on what's happening in the present. 
As expected, my opponent’s footwork is on point. But if I can get a good opening, I might be able to get somewhere. With his right leg, he threw a kick up towards my head, and I took this as my cue to attack his other leg. His right foot hit the air in vain, as I was already down low, uprooting the left from the ground. He had no chance. Within seconds, he was tumbling down, but this was no time for me to rest. I sprawled over his collapsing body, and started throwing blows to his head. Coach always says I need to work on my striking. I will show him what I can do. Turning this already unconscious man's head into a bloody mess. Just like I will do for real in two days and nine hours.

My body sprung forwards as the simulation was halted. It's a normal response when moving from a Dreamscape reality to, well reality. I was sitting upright on a bed, like one of the ones you get at the doctor's, electrodes still attached to my head, my breathing still heavy as I adjusted to the fact that I had not actually been in a fight. As my vision unblurred, I could make out the two figures standing in front of me. Firstly my coach Darryl, a stocky middle-aged man who looked neither joyed nor disappointed with what he had just seen. Along with the bed I lay in, the room contained a large screen, presumably where Darryl had just viewed my simulated fight. Beside the screen was the exit to the room, a door with a circular window. Cables ran down from the electrodes attached to my shaved head, leading to some kind of computer system. My guess is that this is where the Dreamscape reality is hosted. More wires connected this to the screen, tied up and neatly arranged. 
The second man was the vice-chairman of Dreamscape, a subsidiary of French tech giant Visionnaire. He was only a few years older than me, 28 at most, his jet black hair neatly combed. 
“The hell was that?,” Darryl said, somehow breaking the slightly awkward silence with something even more awkward. “Why didn't you just choke him instead of hitting him like a mad cow. That won't work in the real thing.”
“You said to do more striking,” I responded, rather confused.
“Yes, at the start that would of been great, instead of prancing around for ages doing nothing. Remember, you only have two days left.” 
I nodded my head in acceptance, brushing off Darryl's timing inaccuracy which moderately bugged me. Darryl turned to the vice-chairman.
“My apologies sir, we couldn't get everything right today. I know in your busy schedule it's rare that you get to see how your technology is used, especially with your upcoming advancements.”
The vice-chairman put a comforting hand on Darryl's shoulder.
“No no it's quite alright,” he replied. “Everything looked amazing to me, although I don't have much martial arts experience.” He let out a small laugh when saying this and then returned to a professional demeanour and turned to me. “I'm sure you'll do fine on Friday Mr Tomlinson, I'll be watching in. Say thank you to Amir for arranging this.” With that he promptly turned and walked out the door.

As soon as the door closed behind him, I knew my grilling from Darryl would start.
“Do you have any idea who that is?” He interrogated. “That's Mr Rowan Durand, who practically owns all this Dreamscape tech you're using.” 

By now you're probably wondering what exactly this Dreamscape is. Or maybe you've figured it out. Essentially it allows access to a virtual world with simulated environments, sensations and people. Athletes, like myself can use this to practice, without having a toll on our physical body. This probably sounds like something out of a sci-fi to you, The Matrix or something. But Dreamscape’s upcoming developments will soon be way above that, allowing the physical body to mindlessly perform repetitive tasks while the mind resides in the virtual world. Controversial, I know. Should it be considered robotics or slavery? Anyway, I don't care too much, as I have my mind fixed on winning my first professional mixed martial arts fight this Friday. 
“Remember,” Daryll continued, “this technology analyses Machovich’s moves from his previous fights, meaning that this is the most accurate you're going to get to him on Friday. You've got to land some hits on him earlier on. We should go back to the gym and do some final pad work before we have to prepare to catch our flight.” 

Outside of the laboratory, the British weather was as grey as usual. The taxi was already waiting outside to pick us up. As I got in the back seat I looked back at the laboratory. “Visionnaire, Dreamscape Realities” the front sign said, with the little r next to it. Darryl must have caught my gaze as he got in beside me.
“Can't believe a big company like Vissionaire is sponsoring your first pro fight,” he said. He handed me a copy of the fight poster and pointed at it. “Remember you're in the big leagues now.” I gazed at the piece of paper in my hand as the taxi drove off, ‘Terry Machovich Vs Raul Tomlinson.’ Yes, the latter, that is my name. 
My picture could have been better, I actually had hair when it was taken. I was also more muscular now. The date, time and location were all printed at the bottom, ‘Friday 9pm Paris, Light Heavyweight matchup’ I put the poster into the door compartment and sat back in the seat, staring out the windscreen. For the rest of the journey back to the gym, all three of us in the car were silent. 

Darryl and I trained some more back at the martial arts gym, before I headed back to my apartment. I got home as dusk encroached; it seemed to be getting earlier each day, the winter nights drawing in. The apartment itself was quite small and cozy, but as it was just me living here, I didn't mind too much. Located on a quiet side road in England, it gave me a place to eat, clean and sleep. Most of my other time was spent training. 
I only just got in the front door and hung my bag on a hook when my phone started ringing. After rustling around in my pocket, I retrieved it. It was a friend of mine, Tucker. I had barely spoken to him since he moved to Canada to take over his deceased father’s farm. I accepted and put the phone to my ear.
“Hey mate, what's going on,” he said first, his raspy voice made worse by the tinny phone speaker. “Wait I'm only joking, I know you've got a big day Friday and are probably loaded up with prepping. But just wanted to see how you are. It's been a while.” After hearing this I couldn't help but feel a bit bad. I had been so busy that I had forgotten about one of my longest friends.
“Yeah sorry,” I awkwardly replied as I walked into the living room and slumped onto the sofa. “I've barely had time to think these past weeks. How's the farm?” 
“Yeah it's getting there. I actually was wondering if you wanted to visit sometime when you're not in the thick of it.”
“Sounds good.” It had been almost 6 months since I last spoke to him in person. A visit was long overdue. “I'll let you know when I can come after Friday.”
“Alright cheers mate. I'll let you get back to training. Bye” He hung up the phone before I could say bye back. 

It was now 7 o clock. Me and Darryl were catching our flight to France at 6 tomorrow morning. I checked through all my suitcases one last time, just clothes, toiletries and other basic items. That's all I would need. My job is to go and win, then I come home. 
I ran myself a cold bath to ease any soreness, and then proceeded to weigh myself. 89kg, well within my weight class, ready for the official weigh-in tomorrow morning. Now that I had got ready, and didn't have much else to occupy myself with, the stress started ramping up. The funny feeling in my stomach had never felt so strong. Nothing on the TV could take my mind away from reality, even the news channels, disclosing the atrocities and wars from around the world, felt like nothing. All that was on my mind was the dread of losing, or worse, being knocked out. The best action to take in a scenario like this was nothing, to sleep and let the time pass without me being conscious. After going to the kitchen medicine cupboard, I grabbed the bottle of melatonin pills that I had never even opened, and took three, and made my way to my bed. 
There I lay wide awake, feeling both mentally and physically exhausted, yet still unable to sleep, until the melatonin kicked in, and forced my overthinking brain to shut off.

Well, I was wrong. Sorry if you took my advice earlier. The bit about sleeping being the best thing to do when stressed. Over the course of that night my subconscious subjected me to at least nine different variations of me losing. I was lucky enough to get a very random dream somewhere in the middle of the night where a sheep ran away from Tucker’s farm and caused chaos in the local village, before my mind reverted back to me getting knocked out by Machovich. It felt almost as real as it did in Dreamscape. The last sequence I could remember was where I was actually gaining the upper hand using a Guillotine choke, but of course my alarm had to interrupt before I could actually take the submission. 

Now awoken, I sat up in bed for a bit and collected my thoughts. It was 4:30am. Me and Darryl had a flight to catch very soon. After throwing on some joggers and a white t-shirt, I went to the kitchen and made myself some scrambled eggs.
Amir, my manager, was already in Paris, finishing up all the pre-fight planning. Getting the sponsorship from Vissionaire hadn't been easy, but he had managed to do it, so I harbored gratitude towards him. Even through my amatuer fights, he had got me decent publicity, which meant my name wasn't totally unheard of before this one. The plan was to meet him at the hotel before the weigh-in. Apparently I would now be getting a bodyguard to be escorted to this, as well as the fight, which is an idea I still hadn't gotten used to. 

The scrambled egg was heaven to my tastebuds, despite the stress, I was still somehow constantly hungry. I finished eating in perfect timing as the notification popped up on my phone from Darryl saying he was outside. Grabbing my suitcase and carry-on bag I marched towards the front door, where I slipped on my trainers. As I reached for the door handle, I looked back at my place, the cozy living room, and the modern kitchen. The next time I come in here, I will either have won or lost. 

Carrying my suitcase down the steps from the door served as some last minute strength training. The taxi waited at the bottom. As I came down, Darryl got out of the vehicle with a tender expression on his face, like he had seen his child walk for the first time. 
“Ready Raul?” He asked. I simply nodded back. The driver came out and opened the boot to put my suitcase inside. Darryl beckoned me to get in the back which I did, before getting in himself, the smooth leather seats squeeking as we shuffled around. The driver got back in his seat and turned to face us.
“Airport yes?” He said with an Eastern European accent. I waited for Darryl to confirm but he remained quiet. When I moved my head to look at him, he was already looking at me, obviously urging me to confirm that I wanted to do this. I gave him a smirk before responding to the driver.
“Please,” I said. With that, the driver moved off into the dawning sun. 

The roads on this Thursday morning were busy, yet flowing fast and freely, which was fortunate. The last thing I felt like doing right now was being stuck in traffic. As the car shuddered along the potholed street, I turned to face Darryl. He looked content, a slight smile on his face as he watched out the window. The early sun glistened on his greyying hair, and reflected off his glasses’ lenses. Even through the loss of his wife two months ago, he had remained supportive to me. I was young, and naive, and hadn't always taken his advice, even though it was in my best interest. The driver turned on the radio, filling the empty atmosphere with some generic pop music. 
“So Raul, how do you think you'll do?” Darryl enquired. Well, my plan was to win, however reality had now set in that that outcome was not certain. I thought better to be humble and expect the worse. But to not bring Darryl's spirits down, the best response to give was a neutral one. 
“Not too sure, depends on how Machovich is,” I replied. “If I had to guess though, I think a draw is quite likely.”
“On the fence I see, you weren't like this last week Raul. You were sure you would win.” The taxi hit a large pothole as we entered the motorway, giving me a slight shock.
“Well pride comes before fall, I want to remain modest,” I admitted. 
Machovich was a man I had only met a couple of times, both at conferences where realistically the whole aim was to trash-talk each other. These verbal battles I had steered, and generated ammunition to belittle Machovich in front of large crowds. Now I felt like I had switched up, and it seemed like Darryl also thought so. Could it be that I thought I would lose? 

We were only on the motorway for a short while before the driver signalled to take the next junction off. Suddenly a new thought popped into my mind that made me reconsider if I really wanted to win. 
“Darryl, be honest. Was using Dreamscape to practice against Machovich cheating?” I asked anxiously. Darryl’s expression suddenly changed from a slight smile to serious. He shot me a glare indicating that the driver was listening and put his finger on his lip to tell me to shut up. My heart sank at this confirmation of my unfair advantage. He peered round to check on the driver who was not paying attention and obviously in a world of his own, and then leaned in towards me.
“You could say that, but how else are you supposed to have a chance,” he whispered sharply. Instantly, I was taken back by these harsh words. Such a blatant switch-up and direct insults towards my fighting ability was not something I ever expected from Darryl, and left me short for words. I'm guessing the shock was showing on my face as Darryl’s look of sterness turned to a slight guilt as he realised what he said.
“That came out wrong,” he said. I remained silent, still in shock. Darryl sighed before continuing. “Look, you're an athlete. You have to cut moral corners sometimes. What I said just now was, well, I was quite surprised you asked such a question, you're not usually like that, caring about that stuff.” Each word out of Darryl's mouth made my heart sink a little more, however I managed to contort my face back to a neutral expression. Darryl then rubbed his chin as he grasped for words.  “Take, for example, Machovich, you think he's never done any PEDs? Just look at his arms. It's obvious.” I contemplated this. Even if there was evidence for this, would it still make it right for me to cheat?
Darryl continued, “You think Vissionaire has never cut corners to build their company, to build Dreamscape? I'm sorry to tell you Raul, but a strong moral compass doesn't get you too far.” It’s embarrassing to admit but I honestly wanted to cry right now. My motivation towards the fight had been diminished in less than a minute. Why I had suddenly become some ethical philosopher, I had no clue. It was like Darryl said, I never cared about it when I was actually using the technology. Why right now? I nodded at Darryl and let out a sigh. I was trying to convey that I agreed with him, even though inside, I still wasn't sure. 

The taxi pulled up in a lay-by.
“Airport here we are,” said the driver. I hadn't even realised we were getting near. Darryl handed the man some cash and thanked him for the journey. The driver rustled the notes into his trouser pocket and produced a sheet of paper as he pulled his hand back out. I quickly realised what it was, slightly stricken. The poster for my fight. From his other pocket the driver brought out a pen and urged it into my hand.
“Big fan,” he said with a grin on his face. I had never been asked for an autograph before and this suprise pushed the moral dilemma back a few spaces in my mind. Darryl looked at me happily and I couldn't help but let a slight smile appear on my mouth too as I opened the pen and scribbled my signature onto the paper. 

Me and Daryll were soon making our way into the airport. I still wasn't sure if I forgived him for what he said in the taxi, but I didn't have much choice but to go with him. He offered me a coffee from the overpriced airport cafe, obviously trying to make up for his words, yet I declined anyway. The caffeine would only make me stressed again. That was a fair point though, the stress had mostly disappeared now, however alongside it a good amount of the motivation I had before. 
The constant tannoy announcements for departures filled the air, all kinds of people dashing around the place. Most of them didn't seem real, they had their mind elsewhere, too preoccupied to care if they were bumping into each other. 
“Flight to Paris boarding at Gate 5,” blared the tannoy.
“That's us,” said Darryl, and picked up the pace as he obeyed signs for Gate 5. I followed behind, dragging my suitcase alongside me. Every passageway looked the same. The same white walls with the same shiny tiled white floor. The same suspended ceilings, the same grey chairs dotted around the place. Eventually the large sign for Gate 5 was ahead of us. Through the floor to ceiling windows, the plane could be seen, connected up to the building via a tunnel. Beside the gate, was the stewardess behind a desk scanning tickets and passports. Darryl beckoned me to go first, which I did. The stewardess took my documents and briefly checked them, then handed them back to me, giving me a smile. She beckoned to the conveyor belt next to the desk where large luggage had to go, in which I placed my suitcase. I now walked through the gate and into the tunnel, with Darryl close behind. 
Every time I had been in one of these tunnels in the past, I had been filled with excitement over a holiday. This time was different. I know longer knew how to feel, or what to think about. Maybe I was just like everyone else here, soulless, pointless. Stepping into the plane itself, I realised that everyone else taking their seats, packing their luggage away were actually quite content with life. Darryl was content with life. Only I was the one with no emotion now. I found my seat, sat down and breathed. Darryl sat down next to me and gave me a smile. I didn't react. 

Through the next five minutes we got the regular pilot announcements and safety demonstrations before the aeroplane started up the runway and took off.

The stress I was already carrying made me leave in the worst way possible, and now I can’t go back. Since then, I’ve had temp jobs, but I feel like I don’t fit in; I get bored fast, all because of this shitty cognitive deficit.

To top it off, my dad’s always on my case. No matter how hard I try, I can’t do it, damn it—I try to learn or read something, but I can’t retain it. This last thing has made me hate life; I despise my fucking existence.

We wanted to sell it but things were so crazy in June last year so we decided to rent it out until we knew more about what was happening in our life and go and live somewhere cheap and hoped we'd save money. The tenants we have signed an 11 month lease until August because they wanted to move in later than they planned and we didn't want to try and sell the house in September after the school year started. They said they wanted to buy it but were in the process of selling their house. We told them at when we listed the property for rent that we would be listing the house for sale in April and would be considerate with regards to having a few open houses but that they needed to be aware of our plans. 

They have just told us they're pregnant and want to terminate the lease early because their baby is due in June and they don't want to deal with open houses before the birth or having to move within 2 months of giving birth. I do sympathize with them but they did tell us the reason they wanted to rent the house and try and buy it was because they were trying for a baby so it wasn't an accident. We are in a real bind financially and have extended the temporary lease on the apartment we live in until August now, beacause in December they said they weren't likely to buy it. I don't think there is any way we could afford to let them terminate the lease in May and have to pay the mortgage on an empty house for months. 

But if it is going to be way more lucrative to sell an empty prepped house in May-June than to try and sell it now, or in August then maybe it would be OK.

I just need some advice from someone who isn't looking at it as purely their commission amount and pushing me into doing something that is financially damaging to me so that they can get a sale. I know that's basically me asking for free labor but if anyone could do me a favor I would really appreciate it. Not sure about the rules of this sub but happy to do the whole ""buy me a coffee"" venmo thing for your time if you like.",0,1741464718.0,RealEstate,3,0.33,False

I am day 10 tonight, I woke up last night getting hot and neasous, slightly dizzy. Nothing happened but I did get nervous and the shakes. 

I am so scared of throwing up, I'm scared of the stomach flu, and I hate calling in sick to work.. I also have 4 kids and once one of us get it.. we're all screwed and we have a concert to go to next weekend I'm so scared we will be sick for it. (This is also my first concert in probably 15 years so I'm already anxious about that) 

I can't tell if it's from the anxiety meds, not eating from being scared I'm sick, from my period, or from drinking coffee on an empty stomach but right now I am freaking out. ",2,1741464692.0,citalopram_celexa,2,1.0,False

Hey there! 

I'm a guy in my 30s, new to this sub, and looking for someone to share some exciting experiences with. My days are filled with work, but my nights are wide open and I'm eager to meet someone who loves trying new things. I would really like to get out and see the city (Baltimore or DC). With that said if you have some knowledge of places to go and things to see that’s a huge plus! 

Also, if you're a fun-loving, spontaneous, and genuine lady who's always up for a good time, let's connect! I'm thinking dinner at a new restaurant, coffee and laughter at a quirky café, or maybe even a walk in the park, whatever it is, I just want to enjoy it with someone who shares my sense of adventure. If that sounds like you, send me a message and let's start planning our next adventure together!",1,1741464599.0,Needafriend,1,1.0,False
