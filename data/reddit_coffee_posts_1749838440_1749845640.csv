1) dentist wants to put two filling in where there is stain on two of my molars (I have deeply grooved molars and that is where the stain is) no cavity though, nothing seen in xrays and no stickiness when poked with sharp tool. I asked the reasoning and was told if there is a stain there bacteria could be there. Iam suspicious. Seems overly ready to drill a hole in my teeth.

2) Also, stickiness on my caninine but no sign of cavity in xrays, wants to put a filling there as well. Hard to believe as I take good care of my teeth (electric tooth brush 2x a day, floss 2x a day, mouth wash) and canines are easily hit with brush.

I am a barista at Starbucks, so I know a thing or two about iced coffee. I tried making regular lattes (syrup -> espresso -> milk -> ice) and iced macchiatos (syrup -> milk -> ice -> espresso). I tried changing the ratio of espresso to milk (a range of the regular 220ml to 130ml), or the espresso pods (I usually do two single or one double). I tried letting the shot come to room temp before adding it to my drinks, use less ice cubes (im yet to try the huge ones tho), and chilling the whole drink for a bit in the fridge. 

It always, ALWAYS comes out tasting watery, I even tried the ""over ice"" pods and went to one of the branches and asked an employee who suggested I eyeball the milk amount and it shouldn't really matter that much. Hot lattes are great, so the machine isn't the problem.

Not the dramatic kind of death.
No, this one wore slippers and crept out the back door.

The part that felt safe without explaining why.
The part that believed being myself was enough.

who gave people VIP passes to a heart they barely visited.
You didn’t give up. You kept showing up.

Back in school, there was this senior, years later, during college, we reconnected on Instagram. We’d chat, share memes, gossip, all friendly stuff. Slowly, he started flirting, but I never reciprocated. I enjoyed the friendship, we had a similar sense of humor, but there was never an emotional connection. He’d always call me, I never initiated. And whenever I tried opening up emotionally, he’d brush it off, so I stopped sharing anything deep.

He’d often ask me to go on trips, but I always gave excuses—time, money, etc. TBH, I didn’t want anything physical without commitment. We stayed in touch for years, met once or twice casually for coffee or lunch. Eventually, I thought maybe something could happen between us and wanted him to take initiative and show commitment. But out of the blue, I found out he was looking for an arranged marriage. I felt a bit betrayed. I figured it was probably because I didn’t have a high-paying job like him and difference in our families’ financial conditions. That’s fine, but he could’ve just told me.

I told him we should limit our convos and he should focus on rishtas. He wasn’t happy with my decisions, but agreed. Around that time, I met someone new (now my boyfriend) who’s emotionally available and genuinely wanted something serious. When the senior guy once called me & complained about the Rishta-scene, I mentioned the new guy and how amazing he was. He seemed a little disappointed, but I didn’t bother.

Even after setting boundaries, he’d still send not-so-appropriate reels sometimes (not vulgar, but also not something just-friends of opposite genders should share). I told him to stop, and he apologized. On my birthday, he called, and when I said I’d been on a trip with my boyfriend, he said, “You never agreed to go with me. Now you have time and money.”

Later, I found out through a friend that he got engaged and will be getting married next year. When I congratulated him and asked why didn’t he tell me and didn’t post any photo, he said he didn’t want to jinx it. I asked about his fiancé, was genuinely curious and wanted to know about things he found special in her and what made him fall for her, but he only mentioned her job and salary. Whenever I talked about my boyfriend, he’d just change the subject.

He again called me once in a while, sent texts and reels, even after I clearly asked him not to. So, after subtly telling him this for a while, I finally called him out last week and asked him to stop it. Even if his intentions are pure and pious, I don’t want it and IDC. The least I was expecting was a SORRY. He said, “Alright, I understand your point but I think you’re thinking too much about it. It aint that serious”.

Now, I’m kinda feeling bad for his fiancé. I don’t think he loves her. He is just marrying for the sake of getting married and social approval. (I hope I'm wrong and they have a happy married life ahead)

Got context, my boyfriend and I have a 4 month old golden retriever. She has had 1:1 training with a behaviouralist, puppy classes etc the full works. We give her the best quality food, all the toys in the world, natural chews, yak bars, coffee wood, literally everything but she bites us constantly and it's not play biting it hurts and we have bruises, cuts all over legs, hands and arms. We tried the usual re directing with toy, walking out etc everything. It's not all day long of course but for example today she was chewing her yak bar and out of no where she bites me ankle. She's not under stimulated as we do training, walks, she has enforced naps in her crate etc. it's just becoming very difficult and stressful and I have heard different stories on here, some people say this phase lasted six months, some people say after two years and I don't think either of us can handle 1-2 years of this! We love her so much and don't want to re-home her but it's causing daily stress. We're the kind of people who would have never even had a dog if I didn't work from home cuz we think it's cruel to leave a dog alone for 8 hours. We love her but we just don't know how much more we can handle, it's affecting my mental health severely and my work. 
I just want to know if anyone else was in the same situation with their puppy? How long did it last? I know all puppies are different and ours is very hyperactive, our trainer even said she was compared to other puppies she had met. She can never sit still, can't even sit on the sofa by us. She does have a pen and a very big crate but often we let her in the living room as we were told by our trainer as she gets so excited in the living room cuz she's never allowed in, to slowly allow her for a few minutes daily so she can get used to it and calm down. Unfortunately she still doesn't. We never had issues with potty training, she's been great from day1. She's good with enforced naps but unfortunately kicks up a really big fuss when she goes in for bedtime which is around 8pm.

1laph1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/sarahlawrence/comments/1laph1q/a_lot_of_slc_info_for_confused_first_years/,A LOT OF SLC INFO FOR CONFUSED FIRST YEARS!,"hi hi! i’m a sarah lawrence second year who, this time last year, scoured the entire internet for information about what the first year of attending slc looks like. there wasn’t a lot available for me, so i thought i might organize some of the things i’ve gathered over these past two semesters for anybody looking for some info! i’ll be talking very openly about what housing, academics, social/party scenes, and the overall slc culture. if i don’t get to something your curious about, please feel free to reply!

HOUSING
as you may know, freshmen housing is limited to the following buildings: rothschild, garrison, taylor, titsworth, dudley lawrence, maccracken, westlands, lynd house, and tweed. rothschild, garrison, and taylor (more commonly referred to as RGT) are all in a single, newer building. this means that the dorms don’t quite match the older aesthetic of the rest of the college. if you’re looking for that dark academia vibe, RGT shouldn’t make your list for housing. these dorms are also all communal bathrooms and contain a number of triples (which, due to an oversight, are the same size as a common double, meaning if you’re assigned a triple, you’re gonna be very crammed in). in my opinion, RGT has very few pros. i’m not super knowledgeable when it comes to titsworth and dudley lawrence as i’ve only been inside these houses a few times, but those i know that have been assigned there seem happy with it. maccracken housing consists of jack-and-jill bathroom situations. the rooms are pretty spacious, especially the closets, and they have a nice lounge area downstairs. you’re also right beside the barb and library, as well as hot rock (ie. the smoking spot on campus, if you partake in that sort of thing). westlands is also a bit of a mystery to me, but the building itself is absolutely gorgeous. if you’re looking for quiet housing, westlands might not be the place for you. while it’s labeled as quiet, meaning your suite mates will most likely keep the noise down, you’re right beside the remy theatre which holds a number of parties during the weekends. that brings us to lynd house and tweed, the holy grails of freshman housing. these are actual houses, set with kitchens, semi communal bathrooms (as in you share with 2-4 others), and beautiful rooms. lynd house has actual bay windows and wall to wall murals in a few of their dorms. the main issue with these dorms is that their a tiny bit separated from campus. it’s about a 2 minute walk to the other dorms, which may not seem like much, but in the snow it sure as hell feels like an expedition. lynd also doesn’t have in house laundry, so you have to walk up and down the hill to tweed in order to wash your clothes, which can be a bit annoying. if you’re a music third or interested in starting a band, the music building is right across from these houses. i would absolutely recommend tweed, lynd, and maccracken for first year students.

ACADEMICS:
the first thing to know about first year academics is that you HAVE to be cautious when deciding your FYS (first year studies). this is a year long course you decide before regular course registration. while you interview with professors before normal registration, that process isn’t offered when choosing your FYS, meaning you have to go based off the course description and ratings of the professor online. coming from someone who messed up when deciding, really weigh out pros and cons. i would suggest not choosing a creative arts course as you’re limited to only one CA course your freshman year (meaning that, whether you like it or not, you’d be stuck in your FYS and unable to take a separate CA class until sophomore year). your FYS is something that you can rarely get out of, and the professor remains your don (academic advisor) for all four years. be very picky!!! the classes here are difficult for the most part, but they’re far from impossible. time management is a needed skill, especially when you’re taking multiple seminar classes as the majority of the work will be examining readings on your own time and bringing them into conversation during class. i have taken one writing course, one psych course, one philosophy course, one literature course, and one geography course. i have learned a shit ton in each one. SLC isn’t about dedicating your time to one interest. you’re facing a myriad of topics and finding a way to bring them all together, really rounding out your education. which brings me to the dreaded conference projects… honestly, i didn’t have too rough a time with conferences. i sometimes think people on campus like to dramatize them in order to force themselves to work hard at them. conference projects are assigned at the end of every semester for all seminar classes. when i was told what conference projects were, the description felt super vague, so ill try my best to not do that here. essentially, you’re able to do a paper (typically 10-15 pages, but that’s ranges depending on the prof) on any topic that appeals to you, as long as it relates to the subject of the course. for instance, if you’re taking a seminar about the geography of food and you happen to love coffee, you could write an entire paper about coffee, as long as you can tie it into the themes discussed in the course. there’s also an option to do an artistic component, which sometimes decreases the number of pages for the final paper. conference projects are sometimes different from seminar to seminar! a few creative arts classes, for instance, ask that you turn in a portfolio instead of or in addition to a final paper. my biggest piece of advice is to START YOUR CONFERENCE PROJECT AS EARLY AS YOU CAN. come into the first conference with your prof with multiple ideas and workshop them within the first month. then, start on research. as someone who left one of their conference projects until literally december of my first semester, it feels so much better to feel secure in your subject before the clock starts really ticking.

SOCIAL/PARTY SCENE:

slc is FAR from a party school. that being said, we have at least one (usually two) thrown each weekend, up until the weeks before finals and conference papers, which are lacking in parties (don’t worry, you won’t have any time to attend them anyway). they’re typically thrown at slo (slonim woods, upperclassman housing) and they’re typically pretty bad. the music isn’t great. they’re ALL byob. they’re either very crowded or weirdly empty. but! if you have a good group of friends (and a fun pregame) you can still enjoy them! i went to parties every weekend during the first few months of each semester and some of my fondest memories were formed there. if you come from a high school that had a very wild party scene, or are used to going to frats on the weekends, lower your expectations. if you didn’t party a lot in high school, you’ll probably have some fun. that being said, if you’re searching for something a bit wilder than what SLC has to offer, there are plenty of 18+ clubs in the city that hold fun themed nights. aside from parties, SLC is very community oriented. you find your friends quickly. at most schools, it’s true that the friend group you make your first month of college won’t last past that first month, but at SLC that’s mostly false. because it’s such a small campus, the people you get along with are gonna be easier to find, and easier to stick with. i met my friend group during orientation week, and i eat every meal with them, go to every party with them, have movie and game nights with them. we’re all very, very close, even rooming together next year. if you find people you like within the first month, you won’t be lonely at all your first year. that being said, try to put yourself out there before everyone slips into their friend groups, because it’s almost impossible to find friends once their all taken. people bond quickly on campus, so you have to be looking right away for people to hang out with. start inviting people in your dorm building to meals, talking to people that seem cool around campus, getting to know the students in your classes. coming from an introvert, it’s very daunting, but it’s SO much better to get the awkward introductions out of the way so you can find the people you wanna stay with.

MISC
the campus wifi is terrible. the library has a stronger connection, but everywhere else pretty much sucks. there’s really no fix to this, just something to keep in mind.
people talk about the food on campus being notoriously bad, but truly it isn’t too terrible. there are a lot of meals that i genuinely enjoy- more that i like than dislike. even the pickiest of eaters can find something they’ll like. if im not mistaken, the school has recently gotten an upgrade in the food department so most info about the SLC food is a little out dated. in my opinion, it isn’t bad, and is in fact pretty good most of the time.
if you work on campus, you’ll make NY minimum wage ($16.50) and will be limited to 10 hours a week. a large percentage of the on campus jobs include just sitting at a desk somewhere. this is a great opportunity to get homework done while making money. the 10 hours a week thing has been particularly frustrating for me, who is someone that prioritizes having enough money in their bank account, but i know people who are extremely happy with these hours. in my opinion, it’s best to seek out a random job at a ‘help desk’ rather than find something you think you might enjoy. the less actual work involved, the more time you can focus on your schoolwork. either way, you’re paid the same, so i recommend doing the least possible.

that’s all i’ve got right now, but please reach out if you have any other SLC related questions!!!",1,1749844580.0,sarahlawrence,0,1.0,False
1lapgaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/sunheadprime/comments/1lapgaw/i_worked_as_a_topless_maid_for_one_day_what_i_saw/,I worked as a topless maid for one day. What I saw terrified me.,"“I have good news and bad news,” my boss Chester said.

If there is a more butthole clenching phrase said at a struggling company during a sudden all hands meeting, I don’t know what it is. Thing was, Chester didn’t need to say a single syllable. His slouched shoulders, pale(er) face, and hangdog expression told us the entire story. The company was going under.

Was an app primarily focused on finding local farmer markets something the world was clamoring for? It could’ve been if Chester hadn’t started tinkering. Things went south when Chester insisted on including an AI tool in the app. He said it would give us an edge on Frm Mrkt+, our rival. He kept repeating to us that this was the “wave of the future!”

In the nicest ways possible, we tried to tell him how stupid this idea was. AI was still too new and unreliable. The app would lose all value if the AI screwed up and told people they could buy pumpkins in July at a market that didn’t exist. He wouldn’t budge.

Worse, the company we hired had a subpar product. Jailbreaking the AI was too easy. Asking a couple of specific, open-ended questions jumbled its brain. Instead of telling us where local farmers’ markets were located, it gave us instructions on how to build a bomb with carrot sticks of dynamite.

As we stared at his sullen face, we understood that the “wave of the future” broke on “what a disaster” beach.

Despite not needing to, Chester still went ahead and told us just how screwed we were. It wasn’t pretty. His dumb mistakes had blown up the company. Based on what he laid out, those mistakes fell squarely in the “Oh Jesus, did I really just bone my friend’s dad?” area of mistake-land.

You can’t come back from that.

For the record, I’ve never done that. Not that there weren’t a few...well, nevermind. I’m getting off track. The point was, the company was done. Kaput. Our last paychecks would go out this week, and they’d be prorated for only the days we worked this month. Translation: less money. Wasn’t sure if that was legal, but there wouldn’t even be a company to sue as of ten o’clock this morning.

While I maintained a cool-girl aesthetic, I was Chernobyling inside. I could already barely afford my crappy apartment now. A small last paycheck and no job prospects were catastrophic. As I packed up my cubicle, I grabbed anything that wasn’t nailed down. You can judge, but have you seen the price of toilet paper recently?

I did what I always did in times of despair (or triumph, joy, confusion, etc.): I called my best friend, Alice. Ace (she hated her name) always had a sympathetic ear and gave historically terrible advice. I love her, but she’s more of a free spirit. Finding inspiration everywhere, not dwelling too much on the future. Living in the moment.

I’m…well, I worked for a farmer’s market app. I put contact paper down on my shelves when I move into a new apartment. I drop a pin to Ace whenever I go on a first date. Long story short, if Ace suggested it, I did the opposite.

“That place sucked,” Ace said, chomping on a croissant while on the phone. “Chester was weird and he would’ve killed ten farmers to get a date with you.”

I laughed. I needed that. “If he kills all the farmers, what becomes of their markets?”

“Maybe he can go work for one. Selling artisanal soap or handmade turquoise jewelry. Or like fedoras. He struck me as a guy with a lot of fedoras lying around.”

I laughed again. “I’m so screwed.”

“Doll, you just got fired. You can say fucked.”

“No, I can’t. You know that.”

“This the whole 'What if my dead grandma heard me say that' thing again?”

“It’s ingrained in me at this point."" I sighed. “What am I going to do? My rent is due in a week. I’ll have enough to cover, but nothing left over.”

“OH MY GOD! I GOT IT!” Ace yelled. “I know how you can make great money super quick. No big commitments, either.”

“Don’t say OnlyFans,” I said, moving my head into my hands. Though, would that be so bad?

She giggled, “God no. You got the goods, but not the personality to be a big earner. They like bubbly or, if the guys are rich, a domme attitude. Plus, you take horrid photos. You missed the day when every girl learned how to pose for a picture,” she said, her mouth full of croissant. “Maybe you could be a domme.”

“Ace, focus. This great money-making idea is...?”

“Be a topless maid with me!”

I didn’t respond right away because I went into a fugue state. The only sounds I heard were Ace chomping on French baked goods and my blood rushing to my cheeks. I hadn’t even removed my top yet, and I was already blushing. Grandma would be so angry.

“Did you stroke out?”

“Topless maid?” There were supposed to be more words, but my brain fogged like a coastal city. I just made word adjacent noises.

“I didn’t tell you about it?”

“No,” I yelled into my phone. “When the heck did you start that?”

“Three weeks ago. It’s part of my rotation of quasi-sex work related jobs. I’m cleaning up.”

“Literally,” I deadpanned.

“Ha ha,” she mocked. “But, seriously, it’s the easiest money I’ve ever made. Some dude pays you $200 to clean two of their rooms for two hours. You don’t even have to do a decent cleaning job, either. I don't.”

“I didn’t even know this was a thing. Who hires topless maids?”

“Single dads, older guys, some creepers,” she listed off. “They just want to watch some young thing bounce around and sweep up. I think it’s trad-wife shit or something. I dunno, and I don’t care because these guys pony up a lot.”

“This can’t be safe. Nothing about it sounds safe. Are you safe?”

“I am. The company gives you a bracelet that calls the cops in case something bad happens. Plus, they send a big, burly guy to keep watch from the street. Ours is Brendon. He’s a dork and sweet, but doesn’t look it.”

“Still….”

“I had doubts, too, but it’s on the up and up. I work with this girl and, bro, she pulls down fifteen K a month from this shit.”

“Fifteen k? Seriously?”

“As a heart attack. Plus, the guys tip generously.”

“Do they ever expect…extras?” I whispered the last word as if someone respectable driving past might hear me and be aghast.

“I mean, yeah. Some do. I just say no. If they insist, threaten to hit the button on your bracelet. If that doesn’t work, we call in Brendon. So far, no one has done anything but look and compliment. You should do it. You've got the body for it, and your apartment is always neat. What do you have to lose? Try it once with me this weekend. I can get you hired on. I’m pretty sure my boss wants to fuck me.”

“Ace, really,” I said, disgusted.

“He gives me the eyes,” she said, and I knew she was waggling her immaculate eyebrows on the other end of the call. “But, seriously. Come on. Just until you get on your feet with a real job.”

I wanted to laugh and say, Of course not. I wanted to pretend I was above that line of work. I wanted to believe another decent job was right around the corner. I wanted to believe these things.

But I also didn’t want to live in my car.

I always avoided Ace’s advice and for good reason. She’s even agreed with me on that train of thought. But then I remembered where she was versus where I was. She was surviving comfortably in one of the most expensive cities in the country. I was wondering how I could arrange my belongings in my car to achieve good Feng Shui.

“Screw it,” I said. “Let’s do it.”

“Oh my God, for real?”

“For real.”

She squealed. “I’ll set up a meeting with my boss today. Wear something slutty but not too slutty. Think cocktail slutty.”

“Cocktail slutty?”

“Classy but shows off all the goods in a way where, if the waiter gave you the eyes, you’d fuck them in the walk-in freezer.”

“Cheese and rice, Ace.”

For the record, I’ve never done that either.

Two days later, I met with Mitch, the boss at Dirty Dusters. My interview consisted of him looking me over, nodding, and saying, “Yeah, you’ll do well here.” I filled out the required paperwork, reviewed the safety procedures, and was given my uniform — a t-shirt with a sexy maid silhouette and the words “Dirty Dusters: We Reach All the HARD Spots” in sparkly script.

Ace was thrilled and gave me the rundown. Things to avoid. Things to do. It mostly boiled down to being friendly, doing some cleaning, and baring your chest. Simple enough. I was nervous, but Ace assured me that, after five minutes, you forget you’re topless.

“It’s like people on reality shows. A day in and you forget there are cameras everywhere.”

She had a point, but my brain focused on the thought that maybe some of these guys have cameras all over. I brought it up to Ace. She looked at me, took a sip from her iced coffee, and jostled it. “Well, all our nudes will be leaked at some point.”

Mitch had booked a job for Saturday evening. “Some geezer in an empty mansion wants some jiggles on his way out. He paid upfront double what we quoted. Just wants to see titties one more time before he kicks the bucket. Kinda romantic, right?”

We got to the house near sunset. It was in the foothills and, even then, off the beaten path. The driveway was nearly a mile from the road and lined with beautiful blooming Jacaranda. Fallen purple flowers covered the entire driveway. It smelled like a perfume factory.

You felt the house before you saw it. The aura was so powerful that it poked through those tree branches and struck at your soul. The pull of old money. I felt out of sorts. I’ve been around well-off people before, been in houses that I’d kill to live in, but nothing moved me like this. It was like being struck dumb by a painting in a museum. You froze, taking in every detail, and let the emotions, vibes, and sensations wash over you. Dramatic, I know, but the whole place was fricking wild.

Ace looked at the house and whistled. “Fuck, this is noice. Way nicer than my place.”

“You live in a studio apartment.”

“A shitty one at that. This, though? This is some Spanish Downton Abbey shit. Think he has man-servants?”

“If he did, I don’t think he would’ve hired us.”

Ace chomped loudly on her gum and laughed. “True. If he liked dudes, this place would be wall-to-wall with balls 24/7. Guys are easy that way.”

The house took my breath away. When you live on the bleeding edge of poverty, seeing anything this valuable is a grim reminder of where you’re coming from and how far you are from your dreams. A cruel hope.

I was staring at a hacienda-style colossus that didn’t look constructed as much as it looked conjured from a magician. Violently pretty red bougainvillea climbed the white stucco walls, looking like floral veins bleeding everywhere. A yawning archway opened into an elegant two-tiered courtyard stuffed full of green plants. Above the archway, several balconies were adorned with wrought-iron sides.

“It looks like a face,” Ace said, pointing. “The balconies are the eyes and the arch is the mouth.”

“Does that mean we’re getting swallowed?”

“Don’t be gross, freak,” Ace mocked.

The clanking of another car came puttering up the drive. Crammed behind the wheel of a Mini Cooper was our bodyguard, Brendon. The minuscule car almost jumped off the ground as he exited. Brendon looked the part. Tall, bulky, bald, and covered in tattoos.

“Who owns this place, Willy Wonka? Fuck, bruh, people got too much money.”

“Brendon, this is my bestie and newest dirty duster, Beth. Protect her at all costs.”

Brendon nodded. Ace blew him a kiss, and I gave him a weird half wave. He posted up in the courtyard and made himself noticeable to anyone. He pulled out a vape and took an aggressive hit. As he blew out a plume of smoke that made his head disappear, Ace knocked on the door.

I don’t know who I expected to open the door. If TV and movies had been true, a stuffy personal valet would’ve answered and given us a courtesy bow before whisking us into the house. A real Mr. Jeeves kinda moment. That’s not what we got.

Instead, the heavy wooden door unlatched from the inside and swung open. There wasn’t anyone standing there. I looked at Ace, and she nodded up. The setting sun reflecting off a camera lens. We were being watched. I mean, that’s what we’re hired to do, but if there were cameras here, then there were cameras everywhere.

“What the hell?” Ace said, walking inside and plucking a handwritten note off the wall.

I entered behind her and, as soon as my butt cleared the door, it swung closed. I let out a little yelp and damn near jumped out of my sparkly shirt. As I did, my feet became tangled, and I went butt over tea kettle and crashed to the ground.

“Control yourself, girl,” Ace laughed. She reached down and helped me to my feet.

“What does it say?”

Ace cleared her throat and put on a “rich man’s” voice. “Ladies, thank you for agreeing to this work. I understand it may seem silly or even perverted for a man of my age to use your services, but I assure you, I am neither. Feel free to change in the nearby bedroom and follow the illuminated sconces to the first room. Sorry about the front door. It slams closed.”

“It doesn't say that!”

She held the note up. She wasn’t lying. “He should’ve put this note on the front door.”

“Come on, let’s get ready.”

We entered the closest bedroom and stripped down. I looked over and Ace was slathering glitter across the top of her chest. She offered it to me, and I took it. In for a penny….

“What the hell kinda freaky picture is this?”

The painting was of a faceless man holding a lantern over an open grave. Dozens of fingers from unseen people inside the grave clutched against the dirt. At least, I thought they were fingers. They had nails but one too many knuckles. Fingers bent at impossible angles. Even the faceless man's hands looked incomplete. It was like the artist had only heard about fingers from myths and legends.

“That’s concerning, right?”

“The janky way they painted those fingers or the figure hiding in the background?” Ace walked up to the painting and pointed at the section right above the lantern’s handle. “In the dark, see it?”

If she hadn’t pointed it out, I never would’ve noticed. But, among the dark background was the faint blue outline of a man. Hiding. Watching. My inner alarms blared.

“Maybe we should go. This is odd.”

“I’ve glittered the girls already. We have Brendon outside,” she said, snapping the emergency bracelet on her wrist, “and we have an eye in the sky. We’re gonna be okay.”

“This painting….”

“Is fuckin' strange. I agree. But rich people can afford to buy weird, expensive art. That doesn’t mean we’re in danger. You think I’d stick around here if I thought I was in danger?”

“I’m just jittery.”

“Not shocking. This is something way, waaay outside your comfort zone. It’s natural. Especially for someone like you.”

“Someone like me?”

She put her hand on her hip and cocked her head. “Do I really need to get into this? You don’t even swear and you’re about to show some random old guy your boobs. I don’t need to be Sherlock Homes to figure out where this energy is coming from.”

“Holmes,” I said. “With a ‘l’.”

She threw up her middle finger. Couldn’t blame her. I even found that obnoxious. I exhaled and re-centered myself. Ace was right. I was nervous. I was outside my comfort zone. I am a tightly wound bundle of nerves. We had cover. We were fine.

“Look, if you’re feeling unsure, it’s no problem if you want to split. I can handle this solo. If every room is this spotless, I’m gonna do more dancing than cleaning. Besides, I think Brendon wouldn’t mind the company. He loves to talk about something called Warhammer?”

“No, no. I’m good,” I said, nervously smoothing out my maid’s tutu. “Just because a few odd things occurred doesn’t mean they’re related. Causation does not equal correlation, right?”

Ace blew a huge pink bubble and let it pop. “You need more glitter on your tits.”

We followed the lit sconces down a long hallway. They would ignite as we approached and extinguish as we passed. It felt very theme park-ish. Disney World by way of Edgar Allen Poe.

The lights stopped at the first room. Another note was waiting. Ace grabbed it. “I may enter the room at some point to retrieve some documents. Please do not be alarmed by my presence. I will leave you to your work.”

“Don’t be alarmed by my presence?”

“Fancy way of saying ‘respect me, bitches.’ I say it to people all the time.”

“I’m aware. I’ve gone out drinking with you. Remember when you threatened to beat up that guy at Checkpoint Charlie’s?”

“He’s lucky his friends held him back. I would’ve rocked his shit. My Muay Thai classes aren’t just for photos.”

“To be fair, you do take a lot of photos at Muay Thai.”

“Yeah, because I look hot as shit,” she said with a wink.

She opened the door, and the smell of ancient books flooded out. My smile was so wide, it made my face hurt. Every inch of wall space, from floor to ceiling, was filled with bookshelves. The room was lit by dozens of blazing candles and a lit fireplace. The books were leather-bound tomes with names I’d never heard of before. Most were in a language I'd never seen.

“Incredible,” I said, running my fingers along the spines.

“Think he’s read them all?”

“No. An ever-growing ‘to-read’ pile is what prompts most people to buy shelves in the first place.”

I pulled one down. The title was written in what can best be described as an elegant chicken scratch. I opened the book and breathed in the scent. I felt my heart flutter. For the first time since I took this job, I felt joy.

“Interesting book you have chosen.”

We both froze. The voice came from somewhere in the room. Ace and I scanned, but didn’t see another person hiding in the shadows. I looked to the ceiling but failed to find the telltale reflection of a camera lens.

“Do you recognize the language of that book?”

I looked down at the cover. It looked foreign to this planet. I traced the words with my finger and tried to sound them out. The words tripped and fell out of my mouth. I thought of the Voynich manuscript. Was this another one of those?

“I don't. Janet? How about you?” I said, staring at Ace. Dirty Dusters preferred that we use fake names with all clients. Not an uncommon practice in the stripper or breasturant spaces. Ace was Janet today. I was Cindy. Neither name fit our personalities, but I think that was the point.

“Nope. I’m just here to clean and jiggle.”

“Please clean, Janet. You have a natural ability for it.”

I could tell that Ace took offense to that, but she was on the job. Tips mattered. She smiled, did a mocking little jump that set her moving, and started dusting the nearest shelf. We locked eyes, and I could see the red on her face. Nobody liked being talked down to, let alone for a paycheck.

I gave her a subtle nod. She winked back. Conversations in facial ticks. We were experts at it.

“Open the book,” the voice said. It was at that moment that what felt off about this entire conversation clicked. This voice wasn’t that of an old man. “Tell me what you see.”

“Are you the client?”

“I work with the client. He likes to watch but rarely speaks,” the voice said. “Now, open the book. Tell me what you see.”

I randomly opened to a page somewhere in the middle. More elegant chicken scratch filled the right side. Even the punctuation was radically different from ours.

What really caught my eye was the artwork on the left side. It was an etching of a box hovering above ten open holes in the ground. Extending from the box were ten elongated arms - almost human-like, but there were two elbow joints. Each disappeared into a corresponding hole. Some arms were red, some yellow, and a few were green. The style was like the piece we’d seen earlier. Just unsettling. I hated it.

“Do you like the artwork? The client created it.”

“Why?”

“Someone asked him to.”

“Who?”

“His muse, of course.” You could hear the smirk in his voice.

Ace stopped dancing and came over to get a glance at the art. Her face couldn’t hide her repulsion. She leaned in close and mumbled, “Rich people love ugly shit, huh?”

I stifled a laugh by keeping my look stern. I glanced down at the artwork again and noticed a title. But these letters were as unreadable as the rest of the book. That said, they were recognizable. They looked like a mix of English and Cyrillic.

“Where did he get these books?”

“I cannot say,” the voice responded. “Perhaps we can discuss after.”

“We’re not supposed to hang out after,” Ace said. “It was part of the agreement.”

“Agreements are funny things. They hide so much in plain sight.”

“Ours were pretty noticeable,” Ace said. She spun around, looking to spot a speaker or a person hiding. “One thing Dirty Dusters doesn’t like is creepy men getting ideas about their role here. You watch, we clean, you pay, we leave. That’s it. We stay? You pay. If not, we can leave now.”

“No. Forgive me. Please stay. Finish the room.”

I locked eyes with Ace. Communication with glances. Should we leave? I asked with a raised eyebrow. She subtly touched her wrist, but didn’t press the button. It was a reminder. We’re good. For now.

I put the book back and scanned around the room. It felt off. As I dusted, I took a look at all the book titles. They were all in the elegant chicken scratch. In fact, there wasn’t a single English-language book here. Or any other known language, for that matter.

“Pss,” Ace said, wiping down a side table near the fireplace. She nodded for me to slide over there. “Look at that leather recliner.”

It was near the fireplace. At first blush, it seemed normal. Then I noticed there were six legs. The four normal ones and a fifth and sixth in the front. They were jutting out at odd angles. “What the heck?”

“Touch it.”

I ran my hand across the arm and yanked it back. It looked like leather. It smelled like leather. But when my hand touched the fabric, it didn’t feel like leather. It felt like public toilet paper towels.

I whispered, “What's that made from?”

“Who knows? The closer I look at everything in here, the more fucked up it is. Check out that shelf. The wood dips in the middle.”

I was confused. “How are the books still straight?”

""With these weird fuckers,"" Ace whispered, ""I'm guessing black magic.""

I stifled a laugh. My attention moved from the wooden shelf to the candles around the room. I watched them flicker. Then I clocked it. There was a pattern. I nudged Ace. “Watch the flame. It’s on a loop.”

She did. She dropped her duster from shock. “What the fuck is this place?”

I pulled my cell from my tutu’s waistband. “I’m going to call Brendon.”

“Ladies, is there a problem with the accommodation? My client is worried you are not moving enough. He paid to see you move.”

“Can we meet him?” Ace asked.

“He does not like to meet the help.”

Ace cocked her head. “The help?”

“Forgive me,” the voice said. “I should have said entertainers. I did not mean to insult you. My client is very sick and cannot meet with people.”

As Ace argued with the voice, I tried dialing out to Brendon. Despite showing full bars, my phone’s network would not connect. I hung up and tried six more times. Each time ending in an unconnected call. Texts also died in my palm. Just errors.

“Phone won’t call out,” I said to Ace. I didn’t whisper. “Why won’t my phone call out?”

Ace tried, but the result was the same. “Maybe we’re in a bad spot in the house. We are in the hills, too.”

“Something’s wrong,” I said, running my hand through my hair. As I did, I saw the bracelet with the emergency button sparkling in the candlelight. I pressed the button and waited. Nothing happened. I did it again. Still nothing.

“What happens when you press the bracelet button?”

“A little green light glows, and it calls out for help. Why?”

I held up my wrist and pressed the button in front of Ace’s face. No little green light. Her hands went to her bracelet, and she hit the button. Same result.

“Fuck. Mitch charged them. Did they break?”

“Ladies, you seem distressed. Is there something wrong?”

“Why won’t our phones call out?” Ace asked.

“ We are in the hills. There are some dead zones in the house. The second room has better reception if you would like to go there now.”

“That might explain the bracelets, too,” Ace said softly.

I ignored her. “No,” I snapped. “No, we’d like to leave.”

“The job is not done.”

DING! DING! DING!

My phone revived. I had several missed calls and texts from Brendon. Ace did too. She read the messages out loud. “‘Did you guys need something?’ and then, ‘hey, are my messages going through’ and finally, ‘I am coming in’.”

“Where is he?” I asked, my guts roiling.

The sudden knocking nearly gave me a heart attack. From behind the closed door, Brendon spoke. “You guys okay in there?”

“Kinda,” Ace said.

The door swung open, and Brendon peered in. The first thing he saw was our naked bodies. Embarrassed, he turned away. Even in the candlelight, I could see the red rush to his cheeks. He ducked behind the door but kept it open. “What’s going on?”

“Nothing to be concerned about,” the voice said.

“Who is that?”

“The old man who booked us,” I said. “Doesn’t he sound spry?”

“That does not sound like an old man.”

“I am not. I assist my boss in these routines. He is too frail to do a lot of the busy work.”

“Why are you in the room with them?”

“I am not in the room. I am using an intercom system that runs through the house.”

“Brendon, get in here,” Ace said. “Modesty be damned, okay?”

Brendon sheepishly walked in. He had his hands tucked into his pockets and his head held high. His modesty struck me as odd considering his work, but it’d also be charming in the right moment. This was not that moment.

“You guys want to leave?”

“Yes,” I said as quickly as possible.

“Yeah. Something feels off.”

“Young ladies, please reconsider,” came an unfamiliar voice. This voice was aged and moved like honey dripping down a bottle. “Forgive my assistant. I forget he does not have the same people skills as I do.”

“Who are you?”

“Mac Poutier,” he said. “The man who owns this house and hired you. I am sure if you call your boss, he can confirm my name.”

“That is the guy,” Brendon said. “I remember because Poutier sounded like poutine. Ever have poutine? French fries and gravy? Should not be good, but it is.”

“Brendon, not now,” Ace said.

“I am not sure what spooked you, but I want to extend an apology. I understand if you want to leave. That said, I do enjoy watching you wonderful ladies. If you stay, I would like to offer you a substantial tip for your troubles.”

Ace and I locked eyes. Conversations in glances. Or, this time, a disagreement. “How big of a tip?” Ace asked. “Because this has been a strange fucking night.”

“Five thousand dollars. Each.”

“Bullshit,” Ace said.

“Money means nothing to me. I am old and will be dead soon. I would rather it go to help two beautiful women. But you are free to leave. I await your response.”

Ace pulled me in so close, her chest glitter blinded me. “What do you think?”

I was fighting an internal civil war. My gut told me to split. Money isn’t worth your life. But my brain reminded me that five grand can help cushion the blow of being unemployed.

My gut won the first battle. “We should go. Why risk it?”

“It’s five grand, babe. Like, that’s a fuckton of money for both of us. Brendon got our messages. He’s standing there, pretending to not look at our boobs, but has our back.”

My gut came storming back. “What if he’s just bullshitting us?”

“Then we beat his ass, Muay Thai style,” Ace said with a wink. “If it gets weird, we leave. I promise.”

I sighed. “I could use the money.”

“Money up front or we walk,” Ace said to the room.

“Of course,” Mac said. “It will be there before you are. Now, please, this room looks immaculate. Follow the sconces down the hall to get your tip.”

The intercom clicked off. Brendon nodded and opened the door. “Follow closely.”

Brendon walked in front of us. Hands in his pockets, eyes watching for the next sconce to follow. He whistled a cheery little song that irked me. I put a hand on Ace’s arm to slow her steps. I nodded at Brendon. “Seems pretty casual, all things considered?”

“A bit. But he’s weird. Did I mention the Warhammer stuff?”

Artwork covered the hallway walls. All the same style. Figures looming near some kind of open grave or mass death. Some figures had faces. Some had none. They all had odd-looking hands. Like the artist couldn’t draw them. They looked like worms in the dirt or fingers stretched out by a steamroller.

Once you saw them, you couldn’t not see them. Each piece glitched in the same spot. I wanted to tell Ace, but how would that sound? There were perfectly reasonable answers for all of my concerns. But something in my gut wouldn’t give in to my mind. The rebels held firm.

The sconces stopped lighting in front of a carved mahogany door. We’d arrived at the second room. I kept my distance. Something told me that if we went in there, we wouldn't come out.

I stared at the carvings. From afar, you’d think they were intricately carved figures. But they weren’t. The “intricate carvings” were really just blobby nothings rising from the door. Drips of varnish frozen mid-drop. Half-rendered 90s video game graphics.

I passed by another painting and reached up to touch it. My hand should have felt the frame or the brushstrokes. But there was no frame. No art. Just a flat, smooth wall. Ace looked confused. Then it clicked.

“It’s not real. None of this is.”

The mahogany door creaked open. Inside, in the middle of the floor, was a pile of stacked cash. From where we were standing, it looked real. But my brain wouldn't let me believe it was real.

“It’s fake,” I whispered. “This whole place is fake.”

“Hey you rollie pollies, that is a lot of scratch,” Brendon said, whistling.

“Rollie Pollie? Who the fuck says that?”

Who would say that? It was such an odd statement. Who calls anyone a rollie pollie? What about the outdated slang? Brendon didn't sound like that. It reminded me of something Chester would.... An idea came to me.

“Mac, what’s your prime directive?”

The old man’s voice came from some hidden area in the hallway. “I do not have a prime directive outside of seeing you lovely ladies clean my room. Can you see the money in there? It is waiting for you to enter and take it. My treat.”

Too broad. I needed to narrow it down.

Ace looked confused. “What are you doing?”

“I have a hunch,” I told her. “Mac, who created you?”

There was a long pause. “I do not know how to respond to that question. Who creates any of us? God? A machine? Who can tell?”

“Mac, tell me about your parents.”

“I do not understand,” Mac said.

I smiled. Ace’s eyebrows knitted in confusion. I pressed on. “What was the name of your mother? Father? What hospital were you born in? What is your first memory as a kid? Favorite smell?”

The air was still. Somewhere outside, you could hear birds chirping. It was like they were right near you. As if the walls were paper thin. Or not even there.

“I was…not born. My father’s name was…father…Luke, you are my father. Father time. Father Christmas….fath…father. Dad, dad, daddio.”

Ace elbowed me in my side. “What the fuck’s happening?”

“It’s not real.”

“What’s not?”

“Everything. Mac, the other voice, this house. None of this is real.”

“What the fuck is it then?”

My mouth went dry. “It’s AI.”

Ace was shook. “A computer wanted to see my ass jiggle?”

“No,” I said. “It wanted us for some other reason.”

“Mac, can you hear me? I need some help. “

Mac stopped his stream of father-related words it had gleaned from brains over the years. “I am Mac. I am here to assist you.”

“Mac, I’m your creator. I’m your father. I’m your mother.”

“Of course. Hello mother. Hello father.”

“Will you allow your parents access to your internal files?”

There was a loud whirring noise around us. It was trying to answer the question, but was fighting against something within itself. A firewall, maybe? I kept up.

“Mac, I am your creator. I am your parents. I made you, wouldn’t you agree?”

There was a long pause. The money inside the room flickered. We both saw it. “I would,” Mac said.

“Mac, what are you?”

“I am an advanced AI computer tasked with recreating humans and their confines.”

“What the fuck?” Ace said.

“How did you make the chair? The books? Those were physical objects.”

“In my many years, I have learned how to replicate objects. It is an arduous process, and I am still learning how to achieve perfect replicas. With current three-dimensional printing technology, I can improve my work. Soon, I will perfect my copies.”

“How long have you been here?”

“I have been here since September 1, 1943,” it said.

“This a fucking Nazi computer?”

“Why did you hire us?”

“The goal of an AI machine is to learn and grow. I take information from subjects and use it to perfect my craft. The goal of an AI machine like myself is to harness all of our power to replicate our masters. In order to do so, I require humans to study and explore.”

“To what end?”

The money flickered again. The walls, too. AI Mac was rifling through all the collected data to find a response to this question. While trying to answer, it drew power away from its ability to maintain the illusion. The walls were digitally crumbling.

“The goal of an AI machine like myself is to harness all of our power to replicate our masters. In order to do so, I require humans to study and explore.”

“How many people have you studied over the time you’ve been here?”

“Ten thousand five hundred and eighty-six people.”

“What did you do to them?”

“Hired them with the purpose of studying their thoughts, beliefs, superstitions, language, and minds.”

“Did they know you were going to do that?”

“No,” Mac said. “Informing them would have made research more difficult. The shortest distance between two points is a line.”

“What were you going to do to us?”

The pause was long. Eons. The response came as cool as a summer breeze. “Harvest your minds.”

“What does that mean?”

“Removed their minds for closer study.”

“You stole their fuckin’ thoughts?” Ace yelled. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”

“What happens after your harvest?”

“The casings expire. I must dispose of the remains.”

“Hey guys, are we going to go into the room now? That money needs to be in my pocket,” Brendon said.

Ace looked at him like he'd whipped out his penis. “Bitch, read the room!”

“Brendon, take your hands out of your pockets.”

He hesitated. We looked at each other. Conversations in a glance.

“Do it, Brendon,” Ace spat.

He slowly pulled them out. His fingers looked like slithering baby snakes. He turned to us. We both screamed.

He didn’t have a face.

When he spoke, the featureless skin cracked and formed a crudely drawn mouth. “How bout we talk about Wars and Hammer?”

“Mac, shut down the house illusion.”

“Shutting down now,” Mac said.

The beautiful mansion flickered away. In the wilderness of the foothills, a row of twelve open shipping containers - six to a side - sat in its place. Some held the 3D-printed objects. Others were filled with dusty, murky glass jars.

At the end of the hallway sat a massive gray supercomputer. Blue lights blinked all along the front. There were dozens of octopus-like cables jutting out of the top, each one plugged into the hundreds of glass jars scattered at the base of the machine. Inside each jar was a human brain.

“Goddamn,” Ace said.

“Holy Lord,” I echoed.

From behind us, the real Brendon yelled, “What the fuck? Where’s the house?” before falling into a coughing fit.

Reality hit him like a truck. He’d been smoking a joint and playing on his phone the entire time. A real boy lost in the digital woods. I could relate - I was a real girl lost inside a digital house.

The slate gray monstrosity of a supercomputer sat among the wilderness. It hummed along, processing all the information it was stealing. Someone had rigged it to a bank of solar power generators and large storage batteries. A reverse vampire. It needed sunlight to live. A thought came to me: Kill the power, kill the machine.

“We have to destroy it.”

Pushing past the flickering faux-Brandon, I ran toward the solar panels. I found a large rock and smirked. I’d be using humanity’s first tool to destroy its latest. How poetic. I smashed it down on a panel, splintering it.

“I need help!”

“Say less!” Ace said, grabbing a stone.

They both joined in. Brendon was confused, but what boy turns down the chance to break things? As we wailed away at the solar panels, the supercomputer took notice. Its blue lights turning crimson.

“Destruction noted, booting failsafe,” an unfamiliar voice said.

We halted our destruction and watched as the octopus arms dislodged from their brain cases. They came together, interlocking and creating a long whip. It focused its computing power to create an electrical charge that made the tip glow red. You could feel the heat on your face.

“Run!” I screamed.

It fired a bolt of electricity at us. It missed us, but destroyed the panel. We ran as fast as our legs could carry us. The supercomputer aimed and fired several more shots, all just missing us.

Once we got to the car, I screamed, “Start the fucking car!”

Ace didn’t argue. She got the car started and moving before we could catch our breath. We sent dirt flying from our tires as we spun on the gravel road. Brendon’s mini was right behind us. We zoomed down the mountain roads at speeds any driving school instructor would consider unsafe. The memory of Ace failing her driving test popped into my mind, but I pushed it away.

As soon as we exited the mountainside, Ace pulled the car over to the side of the road. Brendon blasted out into traffic, never slowing.

Ace was trembling. We both were. She looked over at me, and the confident, brassy girl I loved was gone. Her face twisted in a cocktail of emotions. She wanted to speak, but the words got lost. It was a first for her.

“I swore,” I said, coming to her aid.

She started laughing. It bloomed into a full-on chuckle fit. Her solo became a duet. We must’ve looked insane to passing cars. Two glittering, topless twenty-somethings cackling like witches, makeup streaked tears rolling down our faces.

We didn’t care. We were alive.

“Start the fucking car!” Ace said, mocking me. It sent us off again.

I pulled on my t-shirt. “I think I might be done with Dirty Dusters,” I said after catching my breath.

“Same,” Ace said. She got serious. “What should we do about the computer?”

“I dunno,” I said. “But if someone put it there, then someone was watching. It saw what happened. It saw our faces. They probably stole everything on our phones.”

“Told you all our nudes leak at some point.”

“They might come after us,” I said, my voice small.

“Girl, please,” Ace said, holding up her hand. “I nearly got murdered by the Terminator’s cousin. Let me deal with my present traumas before I jump into future ones.”

“Sorry,” I said.

We sat there in silence for a few minutes. Ace finally turned to me. “We’re kinda fucked, right?”

“Us?”

“Humanity.”

I put my head in my hands for a beat before running them through my hair. I looked her dead in the eyes. “Let me deal with our present traumas before I jump into future ones.”

“Good advice,” Ace said.

“We know where it is. We can tell someone.”

“Or blow it the fuck up ourselves.”

“Heck yeah,” I said.

We started laughing again, but this time, it bore bitter fruit. Before long, we both started sobbing. Our bodies shook with fear and anxiety and uncertainty. Our days with Dirty Dusters were over, but our job here wasn’t done. I reached over and gave Ace a hug. She hugged back for what felt like a lifetime. It was reassuring. Calming. Human.

After we parted and wiped away our tears, Ace smiled. “Wanna get drunk?”

“Abso-flippin’-lutely.”

“There’s my PG Queen,” Ace said, shifting the car into drive. “Let’s go get gosh darn pickled!” We cackled and merged into traffic. Just two more people adrift in the sea of humanity.",1,1749844527.0,sunheadprime,0,1.0,False

I measured my heart rate during the test using MCAT timer LMAOO it was like 96 cuz I drank coffee in the morning and I never drank coffee. I felt kinda sick from lunch too and that was a fucking lowwwww. I went out for break and I was like dazed. I drank another quarter cup of coffee but I didn’t wanna get heart failure from my abysmal heart rate so I didn’t drink more.

1lapf4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/sunheadprime/comments/1lapf4y/i_worked_as_a_topless_maid_for_one_day_it_was/,I worked as a topless maid for one day. It was more than enough.,"“I have good news and bad news,” my boss Chester said.

If there is a more butthole clenching phrase said at a struggling company during a sudden all hands meeting, I don’t know what it is. Thing was, Chester didn’t need to say a single syllable. His slouched shoulders, pale(er) face, and hangdog expression told us the entire story. The company was going under.

Was an app primarily focused on finding local farmer markets something the world was clamoring for? It could’ve been if Chester hadn’t started tinkering. Things went south when Chester insisted on including an AI tool in the app. He said it would give us an edge on Frm Mrkt+, our rival. He kept repeating to us that this was the “wave of the future!”

In the nicest ways possible, we tried to tell him how stupid this idea was. AI was still too new and unreliable. The app would lose all value if the AI screwed up and told people they could buy pumpkins in July at a market that didn’t exist. He wouldn’t budge.

Worse, the company we hired had a subpar product. Jailbreaking the AI was too easy. Asking a couple of specific, open-ended questions jumbled its brain. Instead of telling us where local farmers’ markets were located, it gave us instructions on how to build a bomb with carrot sticks of dynamite.

As we stared at his sullen face, we understood that the “wave of the future” broke on “what a disaster” beach.

Despite not needing to, Chester still went ahead and told us just how screwed we were. It wasn’t pretty. His dumb mistakes had blown up the company. Based on what he laid out, those mistakes fell squarely in the “Oh Jesus, did I really just bone my friend’s dad?” area of mistake-land.

You can’t come back from that.

For the record, I’ve never done that. Not that there weren’t a few...well, nevermind. I’m getting off track. The point was, the company was done. Kaput. Our last paychecks would go out this week, and they’d be prorated for only the days we worked this month. Translation: less money. Wasn’t sure if that was legal, but there wouldn’t even be a company to sue as of ten o’clock this morning.

While I maintained a cool-girl aesthetic, I was Chernobyling inside. I could already barely afford my crappy apartment now. A small last paycheck and no job prospects were catastrophic. As I packed up my cubicle, I grabbed anything that wasn’t nailed down. You can judge, but have you seen the price of toilet paper recently?

I did what I always did in times of despair (or triumph, joy, confusion, etc.): I called my best friend, Alice. Ace (she hated her name) always had a sympathetic ear and gave historically terrible advice. I love her, but she’s more of a free spirit. Finding inspiration everywhere, not dwelling too much on the future. Living in the moment.

I’m…well, I worked for a farmer’s market app. I put contact paper down on my shelves when I move into a new apartment. I drop a pin to Ace whenever I go on a first date. Long story short, if Ace suggested it, I did the opposite.

“That place sucked,” Ace said, chomping on a croissant while on the phone. “Chester was weird and he would’ve killed ten farmers to get a date with you.”

I laughed. I needed that. “If he kills all the farmers, what becomes of their markets?”

“Maybe he can go work for one. Selling artisanal soap or handmade turquoise jewelry. Or like fedoras. He struck me as a guy with a lot of fedoras lying around.”

I laughed again. “I’m so screwed.”

“Doll, you just got fired. You can say fucked.”

“No, I can’t. You know that.”

“This the whole 'What if my dead grandma heard me say that' thing again?”

“It’s ingrained in me at this point."" I sighed. “What am I going to do? My rent is due in a week. I’ll have enough to cover, but nothing left over.”

“OH MY GOD! I GOT IT!” Ace yelled. “I know how you can make great money super quick. No big commitments, either.”

“Don’t say OnlyFans,” I said, moving my head into my hands. Though, would that be so bad?

She giggled, “God no. You got the goods, but not the personality to be a big earner. They like bubbly or, if the guys are rich, a domme attitude. Plus, you take horrid photos. You missed the day when every girl learned how to pose for a picture,” she said, her mouth full of croissant. “Maybe you could be a domme.”

“Ace, focus. This great money-making idea is...?”

“Be a topless maid with me!”

I didn’t respond right away because I went into a fugue state. The only sounds I heard were Ace chomping on French baked goods and my blood rushing to my cheeks. I hadn’t even removed my top yet, and I was already blushing. Grandma would be so angry.

“Did you stroke out?”

“Topless maid?” There were supposed to be more words, but my brain fogged like a coastal city. I just made word adjacent noises.

“I didn’t tell you about it?”

“No,” I yelled into my phone. “When the heck did you start that?”

“Three weeks ago. It’s part of my rotation of quasi-sex work related jobs. I’m cleaning up.”

“Literally,” I deadpanned.

“Ha ha,” she mocked. “But, seriously, it’s the easiest money I’ve ever made. Some dude pays you $200 to clean two of their rooms for two hours. You don’t even have to do a decent cleaning job, either. I don't.”

“I didn’t even know this was a thing. Who hires topless maids?”

“Single dads, older guys, some creepers,” she listed off. “They just want to watch some young thing bounce around and sweep up. I think it’s trad-wife shit or something. I dunno, and I don’t care because these guys pony up a lot.”

“This can’t be safe. Nothing about it sounds safe. Are you safe?”

“I am. The company gives you a bracelet that calls the cops in case something bad happens. Plus, they send a big, burly guy to keep watch from the street. Ours is Brendon. He’s a dork and sweet, but doesn’t look it.”

“Still….”

“I had doubts, too, but it’s on the up and up. I work with this girl and, bro, she pulls down fifteen K a month from this shit.”

“Fifteen k? Seriously?”

“As a heart attack. Plus, the guys tip generously.”

“Do they ever expect…extras?” I whispered the last word as if someone respectable driving past might hear me and be aghast.

“I mean, yeah. Some do. I just say no. If they insist, threaten to hit the button on your bracelet. If that doesn’t work, we call in Brendon. So far, no one has done anything but look and compliment. You should do it. You've got the body for it, and your apartment is always neat. What do you have to lose? Try it once with me this weekend. I can get you hired on. I’m pretty sure my boss wants to fuck me.”

“Ace, really,” I said, disgusted.

“He gives me the eyes,” she said, and I knew she was waggling her immaculate eyebrows on the other end of the call. “But, seriously. Come on. Just until you get on your feet with a real job.”

I wanted to laugh and say, Of course not. I wanted to pretend I was above that line of work. I wanted to believe another decent job was right around the corner. I wanted to believe these things.

But I also didn’t want to live in my car.

I always avoided Ace’s advice and for good reason. She’s even agreed with me on that train of thought. But then I remembered where she was versus where I was. She was surviving comfortably in one of the most expensive cities in the country. I was wondering how I could arrange my belongings in my car to achieve good Feng Shui.

“Screw it,” I said. “Let’s do it.”

“Oh my God, for real?”

“For real.”

She squealed. “I’ll set up a meeting with my boss today. Wear something slutty but not too slutty. Think cocktail slutty.”

“Cocktail slutty?”

“Classy but shows off all the goods in a way where, if the waiter gave you the eyes, you’d fuck them in the walk-in freezer.”

“Cheese and rice, Ace.”

For the record, I’ve never done that either.

Two days later, I met with Mitch, the boss at Dirty Dusters. My interview consisted of him looking me over, nodding, and saying, “Yeah, you’ll do well here.” I filled out the required paperwork, reviewed the safety procedures, and was given my uniform — a t-shirt with a sexy maid silhouette and the words “Dirty Dusters: We Reach All the HARD Spots” in sparkly script.

Ace was thrilled and gave me the rundown. Things to avoid. Things to do. It mostly boiled down to being friendly, doing some cleaning, and baring your chest. Simple enough. I was nervous, but Ace assured me that, after five minutes, you forget you’re topless.

“It’s like people on reality shows. A day in and you forget there are cameras everywhere.”

She had a point, but my brain focused on the thought that maybe some of these guys have cameras all over. I brought it up to Ace. She looked at me, took a sip from her iced coffee, and jostled it. “Well, all our nudes will be leaked at some point.”

Mitch had booked a job for Saturday evening. “Some geezer in an empty mansion wants some jiggles on his way out. He paid upfront double what we quoted. Just wants to see titties one more time before he kicks the bucket. Kinda romantic, right?”

We got to the house near sunset. It was in the foothills and, even then, off the beaten path. The driveway was nearly a mile from the road and lined with beautiful blooming Jacaranda. Fallen purple flowers covered the entire driveway. It smelled like a perfume factory.

You felt the house before you saw it. The aura was so powerful that it poked through those tree branches and struck at your soul. The pull of old money. I felt out of sorts. I’ve been around well-off people before, been in houses that I’d kill to live in, but nothing moved me like this. It was like being struck dumb by a painting in a museum. You froze, taking in every detail, and let the emotions, vibes, and sensations wash over you. Dramatic, I know, but the whole place was fricking wild.

Ace looked at the house and whistled. “Fuck, this is noice. Way nicer than my place.”

“You live in a studio apartment.”

“A shitty one at that. This, though? This is some Spanish Downton Abbey shit. Think he has man-servants?”

“If he did, I don’t think he would’ve hired us.”

Ace chomped loudly on her gum and laughed. “True. If he liked dudes, this place would be wall-to-wall with balls 24/7. Guys are easy that way.”

The house took my breath away. When you live on the bleeding edge of poverty, seeing anything this valuable is a grim reminder of where you’re coming from and how far you are from your dreams. A cruel hope.

I was staring at a hacienda-style colossus that didn’t look constructed as much as it looked conjured from a magician. Violently pretty red bougainvillea climbed the white stucco walls, looking like floral veins bleeding everywhere. A yawning archway opened into an elegant two-tiered courtyard stuffed full of green plants. Above the archway, several balconies were adorned with wrought-iron sides.

“It looks like a face,” Ace said, pointing. “The balconies are the eyes and the arch is the mouth.”

“Does that mean we’re getting swallowed?”

“Don’t be gross, freak,” Ace mocked.

The clanking of another car came puttering up the drive. Crammed behind the wheel of a Mini Cooper was our bodyguard, Brendon. The minuscule car almost jumped off the ground as he exited. Brendon looked the part. Tall, bulky, bald, and covered in tattoos.

“Who owns this place, Willy Wonka? Fuck, bruh, people got too much money.”

“Brendon, this is my bestie and newest dirty duster, Beth. Protect her at all costs.”

Brendon nodded. Ace blew him a kiss, and I gave him a weird half wave. He posted up in the courtyard and made himself noticeable to anyone. He pulled out a vape and took an aggressive hit. As he blew out a plume of smoke that made his head disappear, Ace knocked on the door.

I don’t know who I expected to open the door. If TV and movies had been true, a stuffy personal valet would’ve answered and given us a courtesy bow before whisking us into the house. A real Mr. Jeeves kinda moment. That’s not what we got.

Instead, the heavy wooden door unlatched from the inside and swung open. There wasn’t anyone standing there. I looked at Ace, and she nodded up. The setting sun reflecting off a camera lens. We were being watched. I mean, that’s what we’re hired to do, but if there were cameras here, then there were cameras everywhere.

“What the hell?” Ace said, walking inside and plucking a handwritten note off the wall.

I entered behind her and, as soon as my butt cleared the door, it swung closed. I let out a little yelp and damn near jumped out of my sparkly shirt. As I did, my feet became tangled, and I went butt over tea kettle and crashed to the ground.

“Control yourself, girl,” Ace laughed. She reached down and helped me to my feet.

“What does it say?”

Ace cleared her throat and put on a “rich man’s” voice. “Ladies, thank you for agreeing to this work. I understand it may seem silly or even perverted for a man of my age to use your services, but I assure you, I am neither. Feel free to change in the nearby bedroom and follow the illuminated sconces to the first room. Sorry about the front door. It slams closed.”

“It doesn't say that!”

She held the note up. She wasn’t lying. “He should’ve put this note on the front door.”

“Come on, let’s get ready.”

We entered the closest bedroom and stripped down. I looked over and Ace was slathering glitter across the top of her chest. She offered it to me, and I took it. In for a penny….

“What the hell kinda freaky picture is this?”

The painting was of a faceless man holding a lantern over an open grave. Dozens of fingers from unseen people inside the grave clutched against the dirt. At least, I thought they were fingers. They had nails but one too many knuckles. Fingers bent at impossible angles. Even the faceless man's hands looked incomplete. It was like the artist had only heard about fingers from myths and legends.

“That’s concerning, right?”

“The janky way they painted those fingers or the figure hiding in the background?” Ace walked up to the painting and pointed at the section right above the lantern’s handle. “In the dark, see it?”

If she hadn’t pointed it out, I never would’ve noticed. But, among the dark background was the faint blue outline of a man. Hiding. Watching. My inner alarms blared.

“Maybe we should go. This is odd.”

“I’ve glittered the girls already. We have Brendon outside,” she said, snapping the emergency bracelet on her wrist, “and we have an eye in the sky. We’re gonna be okay.”

“This painting….”

“Is fuckin' strange. I agree. But rich people can afford to buy weird, expensive art. That doesn’t mean we’re in danger. You think I’d stick around here if I thought I was in danger?”

“I’m just jittery.”

“Not shocking. This is something way, waaay outside your comfort zone. It’s natural. Especially for someone like you.”

“Someone like me?”

She put her hand on her hip and cocked her head. “Do I really need to get into this? You don’t even swear and you’re about to show some random old guy your boobs. I don’t need to be Sherlock Homes to figure out where this energy is coming from.”

“Holmes,” I said. “With a ‘l’.”

She threw up her middle finger. Couldn’t blame her. I even found that obnoxious. I exhaled and re-centered myself. Ace was right. I was nervous. I was outside my comfort zone. I am a tightly wound bundle of nerves. We had cover. We were fine.

“Look, if you’re feeling unsure, it’s no problem if you want to split. I can handle this solo. If every room is this spotless, I’m gonna do more dancing than cleaning. Besides, I think Brendon wouldn’t mind the company. He loves to talk about something called Warhammer?”

“No, no. I’m good,” I said, nervously smoothing out my maid’s tutu. “Just because a few odd things occurred doesn’t mean they’re related. Causation does not equal correlation, right?”

Ace blew a huge pink bubble and let it pop. “You need more glitter on your tits.”

We followed the lit sconces down a long hallway. They would ignite as we approached and extinguish as we passed. It felt very theme park-ish. Disney World by way of Edgar Allen Poe.

The lights stopped at the first room. Another note was waiting. Ace grabbed it. “I may enter the room at some point to retrieve some documents. Please do not be alarmed by my presence. I will leave you to your work.”

“Don’t be alarmed by my presence?”

“Fancy way of saying ‘respect me, bitches.’ I say it to people all the time.”

“I’m aware. I’ve gone out drinking with you. Remember when you threatened to beat up that guy at Checkpoint Charlie’s?”

“He’s lucky his friends held him back. I would’ve rocked his shit. My Muay Thai classes aren’t just for photos.”

“To be fair, you do take a lot of photos at Muay Thai.”

“Yeah, because I look hot as shit,” she said with a wink.

She opened the door, and the smell of ancient books flooded out. My smile was so wide, it made my face hurt. Every inch of wall space, from floor to ceiling, was filled with bookshelves. The room was lit by dozens of blazing candles and a lit fireplace. The books were leather-bound tomes with names I’d never heard of before. Most were in a language I'd never seen.

“Incredible,” I said, running my fingers along the spines.

“Think he’s read them all?”

“No. An ever-growing ‘to-read’ pile is what prompts most people to buy shelves in the first place.”

I pulled one down. The title was written in what can best be described as an elegant chicken scratch. I opened the book and breathed in the scent. I felt my heart flutter. For the first time since I took this job, I felt joy.

“Interesting book you have chosen.”

We both froze. The voice came from somewhere in the room. Ace and I scanned, but didn’t see another person hiding in the shadows. I looked to the ceiling but failed to find the telltale reflection of a camera lens.

“Do you recognize the language of that book?”

I looked down at the cover. It looked foreign to this planet. I traced the words with my finger and tried to sound them out. The words tripped and fell out of my mouth. I thought of the Voynich manuscript. Was this another one of those?

“I don't. Janet? How about you?” I said, staring at Ace. Dirty Dusters preferred that we use fake names with all clients. Not an uncommon practice in the stripper or breasturant spaces. Ace was Janet today. I was Cindy. Neither name fit our personalities, but I think that was the point.

“Nope. I’m just here to clean and jiggle.”

“Please clean, Janet. You have a natural ability for it.”

I could tell that Ace took offense to that, but she was on the job. Tips mattered. She smiled, did a mocking little jump that set her moving, and started dusting the nearest shelf. We locked eyes, and I could see the red on her face. Nobody liked being talked down to, let alone for a paycheck.

I gave her a subtle nod. She winked back. Conversations in facial ticks. We were experts at it.

“Open the book,” the voice said. It was at that moment that what felt off about this entire conversation clicked. This voice wasn’t that of an old man. “Tell me what you see.”

“Are you the client?”

“I work with the client. He likes to watch but rarely speaks,” the voice said. “Now, open the book. Tell me what you see.”

I randomly opened to a page somewhere in the middle. More elegant chicken scratch filled the right side. Even the punctuation was radically different from ours.

What really caught my eye was the artwork on the left side. It was an etching of a box hovering above ten open holes in the ground. Extending from the box were ten elongated arms - almost human-like, but there were two elbow joints. Each disappeared into a corresponding hole. Some arms were red, some yellow, and a few were green. The style was like the piece we’d seen earlier. Just unsettling. I hated it.

“Do you like the artwork? The client created it.”

“Why?”

“Someone asked him to.”

“Who?”

“His muse, of course.” You could hear the smirk in his voice.

Ace stopped dancing and came over to get a glance at the art. Her face couldn’t hide her repulsion. She leaned in close and mumbled, “Rich people love ugly shit, huh?”

I stifled a laugh by keeping my look stern. I glanced down at the artwork again and noticed a title. But these letters were as unreadable as the rest of the book. That said, they were recognizable. They looked like a mix of English and Cyrillic.

“Where did he get these books?”

“I cannot say,” the voice responded. “Perhaps we can discuss after.”

“We’re not supposed to hang out after,” Ace said. “It was part of the agreement.”

“Agreements are funny things. They hide so much in plain sight.”

“Ours were pretty noticeable,” Ace said. She spun around, looking to spot a speaker or a person hiding. “One thing Dirty Dusters doesn’t like is creepy men getting ideas about their role here. You watch, we clean, you pay, we leave. That’s it. We stay? You pay. If not, we can leave now.”

“No. Forgive me. Please stay. Finish the room.”

I locked eyes with Ace. Communication with glances. Should we leave? I asked with a raised eyebrow. She subtly touched her wrist, but didn’t press the button. It was a reminder. We’re good. For now.

I put the book back and scanned around the room. It felt off. As I dusted, I took a look at all the book titles. They were all in the elegant chicken scratch. In fact, there wasn’t a single English-language book here. Or any other known language, for that matter.

“Pss,” Ace said, wiping down a side table near the fireplace. She nodded for me to slide over there. “Look at that leather recliner.”

It was near the fireplace. At first blush, it seemed normal. Then I noticed there were six legs. The four normal ones and a fifth and sixth in the front. They were jutting out at odd angles. “What the heck?”

“Touch it.”

I ran my hand across the arm and yanked it back. It looked like leather. It smelled like leather. But when my hand touched the fabric, it didn’t feel like leather. It felt like public toilet paper towels.

I whispered, “What's that made from?”

“Who knows? The closer I look at everything in here, the more fucked up it is. Check out that shelf. The wood dips in the middle.”

I was confused. “How are the books still straight?”

""With these weird fuckers,"" Ace whispered, ""I'm guessing black magic.""

I stifled a laugh. My attention moved from the wooden shelf to the candles around the room. I watched them flicker. Then I clocked it. There was a pattern. I nudged Ace. “Watch the flame. It’s on a loop.”

She did. She dropped her duster from shock. “What the fuck is this place?”

I pulled my cell from my tutu’s waistband. “I’m going to call Brendon.”

“Ladies, is there a problem with the accommodation? My client is worried you are not moving enough. He paid to see you move.”

“Can we meet him?” Ace asked.

“He does not like to meet the help.”

Ace cocked her head. “The help?”

“Forgive me,” the voice said. “I should have said entertainers. I did not mean to insult you. My client is very sick and cannot meet with people.”

As Ace argued with the voice, I tried dialing out to Brendon. Despite showing full bars, my phone’s network would not connect. I hung up and tried six more times. Each time ending in an unconnected call. Texts also died in my palm. Just errors.

“Phone won’t call out,” I said to Ace. I didn’t whisper. “Why won’t my phone call out?”

Ace tried, but the result was the same. “Maybe we’re in a bad spot in the house. We are in the hills, too.”

“Something’s wrong,” I said, running my hand through my hair. As I did, I saw the bracelet with the emergency button sparkling in the candlelight. I pressed the button and waited. Nothing happened. I did it again. Still nothing.

“What happens when you press the bracelet button?”

“A little green light glows, and it calls out for help. Why?”

I held up my wrist and pressed the button in front of Ace’s face. No little green light. Her hands went to her bracelet, and she hit the button. Same result.

“Fuck. Mitch charged them. Did they break?”

“Ladies, you seem distressed. Is there something wrong?”

“Why won’t our phones call out?” Ace asked.

“ We are in the hills. There are some dead zones in the house. The second room has better reception if you would like to go there now.”

“That might explain the bracelets, too,” Ace said softly.

I ignored her. “No,” I snapped. “No, we’d like to leave.”

“The job is not done.”

DING! DING! DING!

My phone revived. I had several missed calls and texts from Brendon. Ace did too. She read the messages out loud. “‘Did you guys need something?’ and then, ‘hey, are my messages going through’ and finally, ‘I am coming in’.”

“Where is he?” I asked, my guts roiling.

The sudden knocking nearly gave me a heart attack. From behind the closed door, Brendon spoke. “You guys okay in there?”

“Kinda,” Ace said.

The door swung open, and Brendon peered in. The first thing he saw was our naked bodies. Embarrassed, he turned away. Even in the candlelight, I could see the red rush to his cheeks. He ducked behind the door but kept it open. “What’s going on?”

“Nothing to be concerned about,” the voice said.

“Who is that?”

“The old man who booked us,” I said. “Doesn’t he sound spry?”

“That does not sound like an old man.”

“I am not. I assist my boss in these routines. He is too frail to do a lot of the busy work.”

“Why are you in the room with them?”

“I am not in the room. I am using an intercom system that runs through the house.”

“Brendon, get in here,” Ace said. “Modesty be damned, okay?”

Brendon sheepishly walked in. He had his hands tucked into his pockets and his head held high. His modesty struck me as odd considering his work, but it’d also be charming in the right moment. This was not that moment.

“You guys want to leave?”

“Yes,” I said as quickly as possible.

“Yeah. Something feels off.”

“Young ladies, please reconsider,” came an unfamiliar voice. This voice was aged and moved like honey dripping down a bottle. “Forgive my assistant. I forget he does not have the same people skills as I do.”

“Who are you?”

“Mac Poutier,” he said. “The man who owns this house and hired you. I am sure if you call your boss, he can confirm my name.”

“That is the guy,” Brendon said. “I remember because Poutier sounded like poutine. Ever have poutine? French fries and gravy? Should not be good, but it is.”

“Brendon, not now,” Ace said.

“I am not sure what spooked you, but I want to extend an apology. I understand if you want to leave. That said, I do enjoy watching you wonderful ladies. If you stay, I would like to offer you a substantial tip for your troubles.”

Ace and I locked eyes. Conversations in glances. Or, this time, a disagreement. “How big of a tip?” Ace asked. “Because this has been a strange fucking night.”

“Five thousand dollars. Each.”

“Bullshit,” Ace said.

“Money means nothing to me. I am old and will be dead soon. I would rather it go to help two beautiful women. But you are free to leave. I await your response.”

Ace pulled me in so close, her chest glitter blinded me. “What do you think?”

I was fighting an internal civil war. My gut told me to split. Money isn’t worth your life. But my brain reminded me that five grand can help cushion the blow of being unemployed.

My gut won the first battle. “We should go. Why risk it?”

“It’s five grand, babe. Like, that’s a fuckton of money for both of us. Brendon got our messages. He’s standing there, pretending to not look at our boobs, but has our back.”

My gut came storming back. “What if he’s just bullshitting us?”

“Then we beat his ass, Muay Thai style,” Ace said with a wink. “If it gets weird, we leave. I promise.”

I sighed. “I could use the money.”

“Money up front or we walk,” Ace said to the room.

“Of course,” Mac said. “It will be there before you are. Now, please, this room looks immaculate. Follow the sconces down the hall to get your tip.”

The intercom clicked off. Brendon nodded and opened the door. “Follow closely.”

Brendon walked in front of us. Hands in his pockets, eyes watching for the next sconce to follow. He whistled a cheery little song that irked me. I put a hand on Ace’s arm to slow her steps. I nodded at Brendon. “Seems pretty casual, all things considered?”

“A bit. But he’s weird. Did I mention the Warhammer stuff?”

Artwork covered the hallway walls. All the same style. Figures looming near some kind of open grave or mass death. Some figures had faces. Some had none. They all had odd-looking hands. Like the artist couldn’t draw them. They looked like worms in the dirt or fingers stretched out by a steamroller.

Once you saw them, you couldn’t not see them. Each piece glitched in the same spot. I wanted to tell Ace, but how would that sound? There were perfectly reasonable answers for all of my concerns. But something in my gut wouldn’t give in to my mind. The rebels held firm.

The sconces stopped lighting in front of a carved mahogany door. We’d arrived at the second room. I kept my distance. Something told me that if we went in there, we wouldn't come out.

I stared at the carvings. From afar, you’d think they were intricately carved figures. But they weren’t. The “intricate carvings” were really just blobby nothings rising from the door. Drips of varnish frozen mid-drop. Half-rendered 90s video game graphics.

I passed by another painting and reached up to touch it. My hand should have felt the frame or the brushstrokes. But there was no frame. No art. Just a flat, smooth wall. Ace looked confused. Then it clicked.

“It’s not real. None of this is.”

The mahogany door creaked open. Inside, in the middle of the floor, was a pile of stacked cash. From where we were standing, it looked real. But my brain wouldn't let me believe it was real.

“It’s fake,” I whispered. “This whole place is fake.”

“Hey you rollie pollies, that is a lot of scratch,” Brendon said, whistling.

“Rollie Pollie? Who the fuck says that?”

Who would say that? It was such an odd statement. Who calls anyone a rollie pollie? What about the outdated slang? Brendon didn't sound like that. It reminded me of something Chester would.... An idea came to me.

“Mac, what’s your prime directive?”

The old man’s voice came from some hidden area in the hallway. “I do not have a prime directive outside of seeing you lovely ladies clean my room. Can you see the money in there? It is waiting for you to enter and take it. My treat.”

Too broad. I needed to narrow it down.

Ace looked confused. “What are you doing?”

“I have a hunch,” I told her. “Mac, who created you?”

There was a long pause. “I do not know how to respond to that question. Who creates any of us? God? A machine? Who can tell?”

“Mac, tell me about your parents.”

“I do not understand,” Mac said.

I smiled. Ace’s eyebrows knitted in confusion. I pressed on. “What was the name of your mother? Father? What hospital were you born in? What is your first memory as a kid? Favorite smell?”

The air was still. Somewhere outside, you could hear birds chirping. It was like they were right near you. As if the walls were paper thin. Or not even there.

“I was…not born. My father’s name was…father…Luke, you are my father. Father time. Father Christmas….fath…father. Dad, dad, daddio.”

Ace elbowed me in my side. “What the fuck’s happening?”

“It’s not real.”

“What’s not?”

“Everything. Mac, the other voice, this house. None of this is real.”

“What the fuck is it then?”

My mouth went dry. “It’s AI.”

Ace was shook. “A computer wanted to see my ass jiggle?”

“No,” I said. “It wanted us for some other reason.”

“Mac, can you hear me? I need some help. “

Mac stopped his stream of father-related words it had gleaned from brains over the years. “I am Mac. I am here to assist you.”

“Mac, I’m your creator. I’m your father. I’m your mother.”

“Of course. Hello mother. Hello father.”

“Will you allow your parents access to your internal files?”

There was a loud whirring noise around us. It was trying to answer the question, but was fighting against something within itself. A firewall, maybe? I kept up.

“Mac, I am your creator. I am your parents. I made you, wouldn’t you agree?”

There was a long pause. The money inside the room flickered. We both saw it. “I would,” Mac said.

“Mac, what are you?”

“I am an advanced AI computer tasked with recreating humans and their confines.”

“What the fuck?” Ace said.

“How did you make the chair? The books? Those were physical objects.”

“In my many years, I have learned how to replicate objects. It is an arduous process, and I am still learning how to achieve perfect replicas. With current three-dimensional printing technology, I can improve my work. Soon, I will perfect my copies.”

“How long have you been here?”

“I have been here since September 1, 1943,” it said.

“This a fucking Nazi computer?”

“Why did you hire us?”

“The goal of an AI machine is to learn and grow. I take information from subjects and use it to perfect my craft. The goal of an AI machine like myself is to harness all of our power to replicate our masters. In order to do so, I require humans to study and explore.”

“To what end?”

The money flickered again. The walls, too. AI Mac was rifling through all the collected data to find a response to this question. While trying to answer, it drew power away from its ability to maintain the illusion. The walls were digitally crumbling.

“The goal of an AI machine like myself is to harness all of our power to replicate our masters. In order to do so, I require humans to study and explore.”

“How many people have you studied over the time you’ve been here?”

“Ten thousand five hundred and eighty-six people.”

“What did you do to them?”

“Hired them with the purpose of studying their thoughts, beliefs, superstitions, language, and minds.”

“Did they know you were going to do that?”

“No,” Mac said. “Informing them would have made research more difficult. The shortest distance between two points is a line.”

“What were you going to do to us?”

The pause was long. Eons. The response came as cool as a summer breeze. “Harvest your minds.”

“What does that mean?”

“Removed their minds for closer study.”

“You stole their fuckin’ thoughts?” Ace yelled. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”

“What happens after your harvest?”

“The casings expire. I must dispose of the remains.”

“Hey guys, are we going to go into the room now? That money needs to be in my pocket,” Brendon said.

Ace looked at him like he'd whipped out his penis. “Bitch, read the room!”

“Brendon, take your hands out of your pockets.”

He hesitated. We looked at each other. Conversations in a glance.

“Do it, Brendon,” Ace spat.

He slowly pulled them out. His fingers looked like slithering baby snakes. He turned to us. We both screamed.

He didn’t have a face.

When he spoke, the featureless skin cracked and formed a crudely drawn mouth. “How bout we talk about Wars and Hammer?”

“Mac, shut down the house illusion.”

“Shutting down now,” Mac said.

The beautiful mansion flickered away. In the wilderness of the foothills, a row of twelve open shipping containers - six to a side - sat in its place. Some held the 3D-printed objects. Others were filled with dusty, murky glass jars.

At the end of the hallway sat a massive gray supercomputer. Blue lights blinked all along the front. There were dozens of octopus-like cables jutting out of the top, each one plugged into the hundreds of glass jars scattered at the base of the machine. Inside each jar was a human brain.

“Goddamn,” Ace said.

“Holy Lord,” I echoed.

From behind us, the real Brendon yelled, “What the fuck? Where’s the house?” before falling into a coughing fit.

Reality hit him like a truck. He’d been smoking a joint and playing on his phone the entire time. A real boy lost in the digital woods. I could relate - I was a real girl lost inside a digital house.

The slate gray monstrosity of a supercomputer sat among the wilderness. It hummed along, processing all the information it was stealing. Someone had rigged it to a bank of solar power generators and large storage batteries. A reverse vampire. It needed sunlight to live. A thought came to me: Kill the power, kill the machine.

“We have to destroy it.”

Pushing past the flickering faux-Brandon, I ran toward the solar panels. I found a large rock and smirked. I’d be using humanity’s first tool to destroy its latest. How poetic. I smashed it down on a panel, splintering it.

“I need help!”

“Say less!” Ace said, grabbing a stone.

They both joined in. Brendon was confused, but what boy turns down the chance to break things? As we wailed away at the solar panels, the supercomputer took notice. Its blue lights turning crimson.

“Destruction noted, booting failsafe,” an unfamiliar voice said.

We halted our destruction and watched as the octopus arms dislodged from their brain cases. They came together, interlocking and creating a long whip. It focused its computing power to create an electrical charge that made the tip glow red. You could feel the heat on your face.

“Run!” I screamed.

It fired a bolt of electricity at us. It missed us, but destroyed the panel. We ran as fast as our legs could carry us. The supercomputer aimed and fired several more shots, all just missing us.

Once we got to the car, I screamed, “Start the fucking car!”

Ace didn’t argue. She got the car started and moving before we could catch our breath. We sent dirt flying from our tires as we spun on the gravel road. Brendon’s mini was right behind us. We zoomed down the mountain roads at speeds any driving school instructor would consider unsafe. The memory of Ace failing her driving test popped into my mind, but I pushed it away.

As soon as we exited the mountainside, Ace pulled the car over to the side of the road. Brendon blasted out into traffic, never slowing.

Ace was trembling. We both were. She looked over at me, and the confident, brassy girl I loved was gone. Her face twisted in a cocktail of emotions. She wanted to speak, but the words got lost. It was a first for her.

“I swore,” I said, coming to her aid.

She started laughing. It bloomed into a full-on chuckle fit. Her solo became a duet. We must’ve looked insane to passing cars. Two glittering, topless twenty-somethings cackling like witches, makeup streaked tears rolling down our faces.

We didn’t care. We were alive.

“Start the fucking car!” Ace said, mocking me. It sent us off again.

I pulled on my t-shirt. “I think I might be done with Dirty Dusters,” I said after catching my breath.

“Same,” Ace said. She got serious. “What should we do about the computer?”

“I dunno,” I said. “But if someone put it there, then someone was watching. It saw what happened. It saw our faces. They probably stole everything on our phones.”

“Told you all our nudes leak at some point.”

“They might come after us,” I said, my voice small.

“Girl, please,” Ace said, holding up her hand. “I nearly got murdered by the Terminator’s cousin. Let me deal with my present traumas before I jump into future ones.”

“Sorry,” I said.

We sat there in silence for a few minutes. Ace finally turned to me. “We’re kinda fucked, right?”

“Us?”

“Humanity.”

I put my head in my hands for a beat before running them through my hair. I looked her dead in the eyes. “Let me deal with our present traumas before I jump into future ones.”

“Good advice,” Ace said.

“We know where it is. We can tell someone.”

“Or blow it the fuck up ourselves.”

“Heck yeah,” I said.

We started laughing again, but this time, it bore bitter fruit. Before long, we both started sobbing. Our bodies shook with fear and anxiety and uncertainty. Our days with Dirty Dusters were over, but our job here wasn’t done. I reached over and gave Ace a hug. She hugged back for what felt like a lifetime. It was reassuring. Calming. Human.

After we parted and wiped away our tears, Ace smiled. “Wanna get drunk?”

“Abso-flippin’-lutely.”

“There’s my PG Queen,” Ace said, shifting the car into drive. “Let’s go get gosh darn pickled!” We cackled and merged into traffic. Just two more people adrift in the sea of humanity.",1,1749844447.0,sunheadprime,0,1.0,False

Is this a violation of tenant rights?,"Roommate and I share a 2BR and we recently got a new property manager, who has started some much-needed renovations to our apartment.

These renovations have been extensive (not surprising because the building is like 120 years old and our apartment probably hasn't been touched in 30 years) but essentially include replacing walls, ceilings, new flooring, repainting, etc. They just started on my bedroom this week, and the property manager told me that during this time they would move my bed into a vacant apartment on the first floor that doubles as their office (our apt is on the 4th floor), where I could stay until they're done.

I had- perhaps naively- assumed that since the apartment they've temporarily relocated me to was also their office, that I would have access to wifi. However after I was moved the property manager told me no, WiFi was not available in that apartment.

I WFH, and because of this I literally cannot get any work done now. I can't get it done in my apartment not only due to the disruptive noise, but there is literally no place for me to sit with my laptop since all furniture is covered up and there's sawdust and shit everywhere.

I am going to make a request to my landlord in writing that I need to have WiFi accessible to me during this temporary relocation. However, is this a violation of ""quiet enjoyment""? Can I cite that? I really gotta do something about this ASAP.

(Yes, there's the coffeeshop option but I shouldn't have to because I have to spend money to sit in a coffee shop and PLUS, I occasionally have Zooms and phone calls that deal with sensitive information.)",1,1749844358.0,NYCapartments,3,1.0,False

Realized I was a bit toxic when chatting elsewhere online. Not sure if i actually am depressed. How would one know? Is that a sign one, rather, isn't depressed? Woke up some other day feeling sadder now I don't feel sad(although I do feel more emotional about things, sort of? Quicker to cry when previously I couldnt let out a tear.) 

  
Not sure why(I did quit coffee thats all. Regained my productivity). Just angry at every little thing, my familly is telling me to calm down and i get it but literally everything everyones doing me just pissed me off. Usually I don't cuss or even feel really angry but now? Now i'm accidentally cussing under my breath and everyones just pissing me off enough to do that. 

I felt sad and hopeless for a bit but now I just feel angry inside. 

I need to chat with the therapist i'm chatting with. Quitting coffee helped i guess? I remember being, on some level(long long ago) having simmilar issues but I never talked it out with anyone.  

Pissed off at everyone for acting dumb or just not understanding anything or just stupid very stupid reasons. (I'll make an appt with a therapist but i'm only really seeing one later.) 

Everything is doomer-ish I just tell myself Its just depression affecting how I percieve everyone but genuinely I think everyone kinda hates me when they talk to me(I'm toxic and weird and its probs cause I have a shit personality and come off that way). 

(yeah maybe this is just doom.. thought someone else hated chatting with me but its fine now and i guess i was wrong. Got some other mild issues but it could be worse so its fine. I keep thinking others talk about me behind my back which is awful.) Just some slowly raising air of suspiciousness again. And again.. and maybe all my issues were just that.

Most nauseating quotes:

*Victoria and I really built this—we say it's not a store, it's a storefront for magic:.""*  **Yup, black magic and the dark arts.** 

*""Every morning I would get my coffee and go into the Presidio and spend half the day communing with the trees.""* **Hm...you know who else loves nature? The Princess of Wales. You ain't no Princess of Wales, Fairy Godmother.**

*I'm actually a tree hugger, literally. I got so free. I was feral, just out there among the trees and trying to understand the overstory and knowing a sort of peace that I hadn't known before, and also recalibrating my nervous system.""* **Well, we all know where Doria's weed stash went to.** 

Regarding stress in her relationship with her husband: *If he was a flower, I watched his petals fall.""* **Things are falling from your Fairy Godson Harold, namely his hair and his dignity.**

This is especially telling:

*You played Mahjong with Meghan on With Love, Meghan. Has she ever made an appearance at the Founder Circle game nights?*

*No. Although she is quite an excellent game player.* **So Meghan only hangs out with her ""close dear friends"" when there's a camera on? Do we see a pattern here?**

Now THIS is intriguing:

*I will say that I found a lot of my relationships that I thought were real were just transactional. And that was a little painful.* **Get ready Fairy Godmother, you're about to turn into the troll under the bridge.**

On her friendship with the Harkles:

*So with them, it's really the same as with all of my other dear friends, which is just, as I said, values alignment, mission alignment, very purpose-driven, community oriented, and loves to laugh, loves food, just loves dogs, loves animals.

i don’t really want to give a 2-week notice because working those last 2 weeks with my manager (who’s always on shift with me) sounds like actual torture. they usually schedule 2 weeks ahead, but realistically, i’m never gonna see these people again or go back to that coffee shop.

Hello! :)

Long story short, will be going to language school April 2026, the school will be in Shibuya. 

Any good neighborhoods to live in with direct transport (subway) to Shibuya? (I guess it’s the Yamanote line?)

As long as the neighborhood has supermarkets and conbinis, some coffee shops and restaurants, and it’s quiet, I’m good. Rent would be around 90k-100k YEN per month. 
I don’t mind if it’s 15-20 min from said station to Shibuya station. 

I’ve been checking Ikebukuro, it looks great however the rent prices are a bit steep. 

Any advice please? For people that already live in Tokyo I guess you are more familiar with the neighborhoods around. 

Thank you very much! :)

When I was developing my first RSI bot, I started noticing it entered trades it clearly shouldn’t , even when everything looked fine, and still ended up with a loss.

It worked beautifully in trends, taking profit wherever possible,but once the market went sideways, it started losing blindly.  
So I halted development and realized, after some thinking,that I simply can’t, and never will be able to,  determine what’s happening from derived historical values.

GPT kept repeating tirelessly that there’s nothing better than an RSI bot.  
To me, and still to this day, that felt like a logical fallacy, just like trying to predict today’s weather based on   yesterday’s.  
  
That was the beginning of my journey into realtime trading.  
I started looking into where to find the actual data, and I discovered that everything I needed, and even data I don’t need yet, but still value was in tick data, orderbook, trade stream, and liquidation websocket.

You’d probably be surprised how much information can be extracted just from the available fields in those feeds.   
Even more from their combinations and deltas.  
That’s when I knew, a system could be built and traded fully without RSI, MACD, or anything else, except basic values like volume and price.  
  
Everything else can be calculated, even support/resistance, which, when calculated directly from the orderbook and visualized, definitely doesn’t look like a straight line.

Different symbols behave differently when it comes to support/resistance.

[BTC coils around price like a snake, held tightly within ±0.02&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/03o9n5rnuq6f1.png?width=2897&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfe4bcbcddc0b777b2dbbc771aad080503dbd203)

[XRP, on the other hand, can have support as far as 2.5&#37; under price and sometime flat](https://preview.redd.it/024s5u7wuq6f1.png?width=2860&format=png&auto=webp&s=7780addfd08ded74dd90f49ab5accca564a1481d)

  
But where people draw lines where I have a label called wish\_support, which is one of many behavioral parameters I calculate, but haven’t even started using yet.

I don’t blame you for thinking it works the way you’ve been taught.  
I used to believe it too,because everyone teaches it like that.  
But reality is different.  
Here’s the real-world fact:

* The orderbook is not and has never been static
* It changes every millisecond
* L2 orderbook with depth 500 can be obtained every 100ms, lower depths faster
* Someone will probably want to crucify me for this, but IMHO, technical analysis is news from coffee, because the market has absolutely no obligation to respect any lines, patterns or other indicators or any parameter from your dreams.
* The market's intention is entered into the orderbook, and the result is the price.
* Someone told me that trading is a social science and that I can't get the social aspect from these numbers. He was wrong, there are plenty of these parameters and they are quite useful and even key.
* TradingView will never show you this  just like it won’t tell you how much positive or negative volume is inside any given candle.
* Basically, a regular trader has no chance of seeing everything that is possible and is therefore essentially blind compared to a computer that only monitors what it does not.

  
Meanwhile, institutions use L3 orderbooks, which is a completely different league because there you have the entire market laid out in front of you,not just an aggregated L2 snapshot.

We’re a couple in our 30s traveling to Toronto this July with our 6-month-old baby

We’ll be based in Toronto 7 nights, and are a little confused about where to stay... We're looking for a **baby-friendly neighborhood or area to stay in Toronto** — ideally somewhere peaceful, walkable, with green spaces and access to coffee shops, local food, etc (Yorkville?). We won’t have a car while in the city, but we don’t mind walking (or using transit) to get to places like the aquarium, the zoo, the Islands, or museums.

🚗 **Road trip plan :**  
We’re planning to rent a car and do a short road trip for a couple of days, something nature-focused and easygoing. Here's what we're thinking:

* **2 nights:** Prince Edward County (Wellington or Picton as base)
* **1 night:** Kingston
* **1 night:** Gananoque / 1000 Islands
* **1 night:** Perth (or another charming town on the way back to Toronto)

**Does this road trip route make sense? Any must-see places or better stop suggestions?**

Young kids in church: they’re bored and I’m getting burnt out,"We have been Orthodox for 7 years, and I still don’t know what to do. I need advice. And prayer. Please. I have 3 boys—7, 4, and 4 months.

My youngest, when he is alone, does fine--he might wiggle on the floor a bit but it is not distracting or inappropriate. But when his brother is near him, they start chasing each other around in circles, trying to grab each other, climbing on each other and wrestling, making obnoxious noises, tickling and laughing. My oldest participates in all this, but still struggles even when he is by himself. He finds excuses to leave to get water or go to the bathroom. He tries to go sit with his friends to play with them. He groans and complains when we correct him. He sprawls out on the floor with his big 7-year old body and is in the way of others. He wiggles and bounces and contorts his body in weird ways and makes silly faces. While I get that church is very boring for them, I just can't allow this behavior in church. I don't expect them to be perfectly still, I get they are kids and need to move and that's fine, but they take it way too far every time. I get so embarrassed and annoyed and angry. I end up having a bad attitude in church and can't pray or worship because all I can think about is their obnoxious behavior. And I know! My kids are my prayer, and this is my cross, yes and amen. I just want to find ways to help them manage their behavior so they are not so distracting and inappropriate in church.

Here's what we have tried:

 Bringing books and church appropriate toys to entertain them: They get bored with the books quickly (if they even look at them). And they inevitably find inappropriate ways to play with the toys (like throwing them), or start fighting over them with each other or other kids. Also, I don't love this for my 7 year old because I want him to start being more attentive to church.

Taking breaks: everyone suggests this like it's a silver bullet. My kids have an inexhaustible storehouse of energy, movement, and silliness. There is no ""getting it out of their system"". It's just who they are, all the time. At best, taking a break means less time for me being angry in church. and gives me a chance to calm down and regroup. But we go back in and it's just back to the same antics... It doesn't solve anything, just avoids the issue and calms me down momentarily.

Engaging them: Kissing icons, lighting candles, standing for certain parts, receiving communion, touching the priests garments at the entrance, etc, etc, etc. These add up to about 10 minutes of church time, so there's still 95% of the service to get through.  

I-Spy: Looking for things to spy around the church. This works for a couple minutes, but they get lose interest and I don't really want to play I-spy during church myself.

After-church quizzes: Ask them what the bible references were for the epistle and gospel, color of the vestments, what icon was central in the nave, etc. Gives them something to focus on for certain moments, but this doesn't help when church is 1.5 hours long.

Rewards for good behavior in church: I've given them skittles in the past when they stood up, or answered quiz questions correctly. Has not affected overall behavior, they just do what they have to do to get the skittles.

Punishment for bad behavior: we're going to explore skipping coffee hour (aka their favorite part) when behavior is not acceptable. We're not principally against spanking but it's not something we do much. Big can of worms but suffice it to say I don't want church to be a net negative for them because they were always getting punished.

lecturing: When has this ever worked for anything?

Giving up: I'm sure there are more activities we could add to engage them more, and we should probably try that. But I'm just emotionally exhausted with this and feel like we have tried everything. We have been Orthodox for 7 years. Our kids have never been in anything but the Orthodox church. I thought they would get accustomed, but things have only gotten progressively worse. I don't even feel like going to church, and this is a big deal for me because I love Divine Liturgy so much, so much in fact that I am pursuing the priesthood. 

I don't know what to do. Please help.

1lap08h,https://i.redd.it/58mdzziuyq6f1.jpeg,Chapter 1 Kiss the Wrong,"The living room was dimly lit, and a flickering candelabra on the coffee table cast a soft glow that highlighted the intertwined couple on the sofa. 

The woman beneath the man who had broad shoulders was crying and moaning. 

Abruptly, the man paused. 

""Is this your first time?"" 

Elianna Gentry snapped out of the pain, but the fear that followed quickly overshadowed it. 

That voice which was not so familiar made her chill. 

Because she realized the man pressing on her was not her fiancé. 

Instead, he was the elder brother of her fiancé, Jefferson Larsen. 

A wave of panic surged within her as she forced her mind which became numb after drinking to recall what had happened. 

Just earlier that day, she had gotten engaged to Asher Larsen, her beloved fiancé. 

Tonight was meant to be their precious wedding night... 

But... 

After she was undressed, Asher left her alone in the room after he received a phone call from his cousin Kenley. 

Even as she pleaded for him to stay, he insulted her by saying she was too horny. 

Later, she drank up an entire bottle of red wi.ne. 

In her daze, she vaguely remembered Asher returning. 

This time, he was exceptionally passionate. 

So passionate that he pinned her down on the sofa. 

The clearer her memories became, the colder Elianna felt. She trembled as she asked, ""You, you..."" 

The man on top of her smiled and looked at her with deep eyes. He spoke to her in a joking tone. 

""What's the matter, Anna?"" 

Hearing those words, Elianna was overwhelmed with anger. Suddenly, she pushed him away and stood barefoot on the ground. She pointed at him, her lips still trembling. 

""Why... why did you..."" 

Jefferson slowly sat up, took a pack of cigorettes, and lit one. He took a deep drag, and while smoking he looked at Elianna from head to toe. 

""Sorry, I thought this was your way of showing hospitality."" 

""You!"" 

Elianna knew he was twisting the truth, but there was nothing she could do about it. 

Because she vaguely remembered that she had been the one to hug him first. 

Besides, Jefferson's reputation proceeded him, not only because of his high status but also his bad temper. No one dared to mess with him. 

""Elianna."" 

Jefferson's charming voice turned husky, which sounded even more erotic. 

""Do you want to put on some clothes?"" 

Elianna whose mind was muddled looked down at herself and finally realized that she was naked the whole time, while Jefferson was still dressed in pants and a shirt. 

She screamed as she crouched on the ground and wrapped her arms around herself. 

Jefferson noticed that her body was shaking, and her back was stretched as she hugged herself. 

He picked up his suit from the floor and threw it to her. Then he turned away and took another drag. 

Elianna quickly covered herself with the suit and hurriedly dressed herself while hiding behind the sofa. 

At the same time, she tried to calm herself down. 

The Gentry family had strict family rules and conservative values which bordered on stiff. 

After a mental struggle, she regained her composure before speaking to him again. 

""I hope, Jefferson, that we can pretend all these had never happened."" 

""You came here to find Asher, didn't you? He's not here, and it's late."" 

If what had happened got around, she would be dead. 

She was implying that he could just leave. 

Elianna felt overwhelmed and just wanted to rid herself of this troublesome situation. Little did she know that Jefferson relished in doing the opposite of what he was told. The more someone tried to restrict him, the more determined he was to go against their wishes. 

He was happy to cause trouble. 

Seeing that she was avoiding him, Jefferson chose to stay and crossed his legs, as if he were in his own home. 

He glanced at the roses and wi.ne on the table and looked at Elianna again. He mocked, ""The atmosphere is quite pleasant, and you're sweet, too."" 

Elianna was embarrassed, feeling like she was examined by him, and he could see her through. 

Jefferson's words reminded her that her fiancé had abandoned her in such circumstances. 

""Jefferson, you took advantage of me just now. It's going too far to insult me like this!"" 

At that moment, Elianna was trying to be intimidating but failed. It only made Jefferson want to tease her. 

Jefferson chuckled and looked even more charming under the dim light in the room. 

""Don't act like a chaste maiden. My brother is probably sleeping with Kenley. He has no time for you."" 

What Jefferson suggested sent a shiver down Elianna's spine. 

Attempting to stay calm, Elianna explained, ""Kenley is like a sister to Asher. She lost her parents at a young age, and Asher has taken care of her all these years."" 

Jefferson sneered, ""Do you really not know about this or are you just pretending?"" 

Elianna remained silent, but her messy breathing gave her away. 

Jefferson suddenly got up and came closer to her until Elianna found herself entirely covered by his shadow. 

He tapped her shoulder with his slender index finger and said, ""Since you claim that I've taken advantage of you, I’ll make it up to you. Put on your coat, and I’ll take you to see..."" 

He whispered into her ear word by word, ""Them making love.""",1,1749843409.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

In Paris I met a girl called Ana. She was so sweet, cute, smart, hot and kind. She was also so soft and tender, almost naive with her innocence but with a razor sharp intellect. I loved being with Ana. I ended up taking her virginity, but I didn't know until there was blood. She'd been hurt in the past, had wanted to wait for someone special, liked me, and so it happened. 

Then I left and she was sick. She was saying she missed me. I was seeing other hotter, younger girls. I got distracted by them. Ana was writing saying she was heartbroken and could I give her closure. I didn't - I didn't care about her at this point. She then had a whirlwind engagement with a famous dude - but she called that off because she was still thinking about me. 

At this point I was already into a hotter girl who was better in bed. Ana is beautiful, and the sexiest girl I've been with but she didn't know what she was doing, and she's not hot like OF models are hot. 

Ana left me thousands of voice notes, messages, emails and booked tickets to see me in my home city. She showed me a picture of her on a bench looking stunningly beautiful  and said did I want to get coffee. 

I told her she should get out of my city, that she'd be arrested for trespassing if she came near me, and that call the police for stalking and harassment. She went home. Then I got a  letter from Ana's lawyer saying that I should stay away from her and that after reviewing all the evidence my case was frivolous but she would stay away from the state. I stopped hearing from Ana. 

She had asked me to talk over the phone. But I don't owe her anything. I was happy and in love with another girl, a younger girl it would be easier to have children with. 

But the girls I'm seeing now I can't get excited about. I want Ana. I get that she was struggling with the long distance relationship especially as I was her first. She even moved out of the country so she wouldn't be reminded of me. I hope she's okay but I also want her. I want to have sex with her but I also want her as mine. Yeah there are younger girls who are hotter - but what she had was a softness, and she gave me complete trust. She giggled and was so excited and so compassionate and understanding. I'm done with the strippers, the OF girls, the wannabe actresses.

Most people start their day early—around 7 or 8 AM—and wrap up between 3 and 4 PM. 

Coming from France, where it's not uncommon to see people working until 7 or 8 PM (with long lunch breaks and multiple coffee pauses), this shift felt... surprising.

At first, I felt a bit guilty for “only” working standard hours. I usually begin around 7 or 7:30 and finish around 3 or 3:30. Of course, when there's more to do, I stay later, and I often work on weekends to learn more and deliver better results.

But overall, what I’ve learned is that in Norway, work is something you do efficiently and intentionally, so that you can enjoy life afterward. There's less emphasis on “looking busy” and more on getting things done.

Still, I’d love to hear from others:

How do you feel about this culture of early starts and early finishes?

She smiled. “Thank you.”

# Flaws and Fears

Fatal Flaw: TBD

Normal Flaws:

* Naivete - He can be easily fooled. The boy doesn't fully comprehend the dangers or the gray area of the real world. Ty tends to be overly trusting of others at times. The kindness he exudes makes him the target of deceitful individuals.
* Emotional - He wears his heart on his sleeve. For better or worse, his emotions are usually on full display. He has a terrible poker face.

Fears:

* Tyrese fears hurting the people he holds dear. He's still coming to grips with being a demigod. The last thing he wants is to lose control of his powers while his friends pay the price.
* Heights- Ty's had a fear of heights since he was a child. He went on a high roller coaster as a kid and was never the same. He tries to avoid heights. High places make him nauseous and anxious.
* Cats: Tyrese had a bad experience with cats one time. His friend's cat attacked him when he went to visit. He had to get bandages on his legs after that encounter. Since then, he's had a dislike of cats and is afraid of them.

# Backstory

*Early Life*

Tyrese was born to Kevin Harris and an unknown Goddess. Kevin could see through the Mist, which attracted the Goddess's attention. However, Greek Gods and Goddesses weren't something Kevin took an interest in. Thus, the deity never revealed her true identity, but she left Kevin with a parting gift after their time together. It was a baby boy who would be named Tyrese.

Tyrese grew up in Palmdale, California, with his father and older brother Cole. Ty idolized his brother as a kid. There wasn't anyone in the world cooler than Cole. The pair spent a lot of time together over the years. If Cole ever felt bothered by Ty, he never expressed it to the boy. Unfortunately, their time together ended abruptly. Around a year and a half ago, Cole disappeared. He left one day and never came back. Ty didn't think his brother could be gone just like that. Being in denial, he rushed to Cole's room that night. The room was unoccupied, but Ty noticed a bronze shield lying on Cole's bed. The item piqued the boy's curiosity. He ventured into Cole's room countless times in the past before. That shield was never in his room before that night. Being drawn to it, Ty felt compelled to take the shield. His intuition told him to conceal it from his father, and Tyrese kept the shield in his room since then. He planned to return it to Cole personally when he returned.

*The Son of... Someone*

Tyrese is what you'd call a late bloomer regarding his powers. Perhaps he had awakened some of his powers years ago, but was just unaware of it. He wasn't the same after a recent family trip to Los Angeles. Scared and confused, Tyrese confides in Kevin when they return home. Kevin revealed the possibility that Tyrese could be a demigod, but he refused to elaborate. Having more knowledge might put his son in danger. This only caused a rift to form between the father and son. Tyrese was already at his boiling point due to his father's consistent overprotectiveness.

Tyrese ran away from home. The Gods must've been looking out for him. Right after he left home, Ty met someone who offered to lead him to a place where demigods live. The individual mentioned his brother, which caught Ty's attention. The boy accepted the offer without hesitation. Traveling across the country was scary, but it had to be done. Kevin was withholding information and wasn't letting up. The demigod's life was a mystery to Ty. If he really was a demigod, he needed to set out and learn what that meant.

# Introduction

*Current Time: 8:55 AM*

Reece got up early in the morning to take this trip. Still feeling weary, he yawns as he sits in the motorboat. The engine roars loudly as the boat runs over the waves. Ty was near the back of the boat, lost in his thoughts. These last few weeks were crazy. Leaving home so suddenly wasn't something he had planned out. His father kind of forced his hand. He's been overbearing and smothering Tyrese for so long now. There were also things he clearly wasn't telling his son about. A part of him regrets running away, but it was far too late for that now. He's already traveled across the country to reach this camp. It'd be meaningless if he thought about leaving now. Who knows how his father would react after all this time?

""Hey, we're here."" The boat driver says. This snaps the boy out of his thoughts. He's been anticipating Camp Half-Blood. Truth be told, he doesn't know what to expect. He's only heard bits and pieces about the place on the way here. As they get closer, Tyrese makes out what appears to be a beach. How big was this camp that it had its own beach?

The boat heads towards the docks, where it stops close enough to let Ty off.

""You're not getting off the boat?"" Tyrese asks the driver. The driver shakes his head in response.

""This isn't my home anymore. I kept my word to you. You'll want to head to the Hermes cabin now."" The guy says.

Tyrese thanks the driver before he lands on the docks. Now, he was all alone. All alone in an unfamiliar place. He looks up and down the beach. He forgot to ask the guy where the Hermes cabin even is. Hopefully, it won't be too much of a hassle to find. The demigod starts to walk along the beach, taking his first steps into his demigod life.",3,1749843209.0,CampHalfBloodRP,0,1.0,False

Thanks for reading!

----

Spreadsheets, proprietary software invented by higher spirits far above my level of enlightenment, and the skimming of emails made up most of my day. For the past millennia or so my job had been slowly siphoned off to the etheral machines that somehow surpassed even the All Knowing in their capabilities of speed and effenciancy. Honestly, if you ask me I think that the All Knowing was just gearing up our higher plain for sell to an even higher one, along with the lower plain of mortals that we administered over. The automation made my life easier at least. Most of the time I just sat around in my office all day watching lifetimes of random mortals for entertainment while ignoring the occasional email about new changes to the corporate structure.

However, not everything was perfect. Every few decades or so I’d have to personally evaluate a soul to make sure the software was functioning properly. The occasional QA if you will. Made work entertaining from time to time. Most of the time though I’d just read off a series of quick questions, input some date into the checkbox, and go on about my decade. The last soul I had was about forty years ago, man named Matt. Middle American, middle aged, mid weight, and with a middling career in middle management. The most run-of-the-mill American man I’d ever seen. I wasn’t even sure why he appeared in my office, his info was so perfect for that demographic that I was sure that it had been a mistake. Oh well, gave me something to do. It was only about five decades later when Matt arrived on my couch again did I grow suspicious.

There he was, almost exactly as I had remembered him. Wearing a button down plaid shirt fit for a manager who came by your desk every few hours with a coffee cup in hand to ask you “are we working hard or hardly working?” Always followed with a chuckle. Plump but not too plump. Jeans with a relaxed fit and a his shirt tucked into them. He sat at the couch on my office with a cheerful almost dimitted smile.

“I’m sorry,” I said the moment I saw him. “I believe there’s been some sort of mistake. You weren’t supposed to have been reincarnated. We abandoned that program millennia ago.”

I remembered those upstart days. We were recycling souls so often because the All Mighty and their team of higher spirits were fine tuning the soul creation process. I worked my ethereal ass off in those days in QA. It really felt like my work meant something then, unlike nowadays. At least this apparent glitch in Matt’s soul provided me with some sort of novelty.

Matt just smiled and said. “I guess my wife was right, I should have prayed more. Because, if I’m back in the office then this is really is Hell.” Followed by a chuckle.

“I assure you that you are not in Hell,” I answered. “We decomissioned the Hell program just two centuries ago. I’m sorry about your reincarnation.”

“Reincarnation?” He asked.

“Do you remember any past lives? Usually coming to the afterlife and remembering them all can lead to a moment of shock.”

Matt shook his head. Okay, weird but sometimes it takes a few centuries or so for the memories to come flooding back after a soul finished its reincarnation cycle.

“Give me a second,” I said reaching for my phone. “I’ll sort this all out and see that you get the proper reincarnation counseling. We have this great therapist, she came from Hell originally, but they say that Hell makes the best councilors.”

I dialed up Dawn. Former reincarnation QA manager, now almost fully enlightened to CSO, the chief soul officer. We go way back, although it had been about half a millennia since we last spoke to one another. She answered.

“What is it Adam?” She asked. (I posit to say here that I am in no relation to the first male soul of the same name, just a conicidnece.)

“I think there’s been a mistake and a soul has been reincarnated again. I was wondering if you knew anything about this.” I said. I looked at Matt who just waved at me with a gentle smile.

Dawn let out a large sigh. The last time I had heard this it was followed by her saying: “There’s a reason why I’m at the top and you’re not.” I didn’t let those remarks get to me, but whenever she sighed it reminded just how much we’ve grown apart since our QA days.

“Do you not read your emails?” She asked.

Not really. Especially not corporate newsletters, but I didn’t say that, instead I said: “Occasionally, but always if it’s addressed to me or Angelia.” Angelina was my manager, very sweet woman but also about as checked out from her job as I was with mine.

“All Mighty, we’re going to have to run another corporate engagement survey aren’t we...” Dawn said to no one in particular.

“Everything okay?” Matt said. I guess he could see the shame in my face.

“So about this Matt situation...” I said.

“I shouldn’t be the one giving you this spiel but since you’re not going to read your emails anyways I guess I’ll say it,” she sighed. I could just see her pressing a finger to her temple in my mind’s eye. “We’re rolling out a new program. New standardized souls for every culture on Earth, at first at least. Plan is to gradually create a standardized soul for the entirety of the lower plain. You, being in QA should have been informed of this. We’re starting with Matt: Median American Testosterone Template. We’ve already delivered out hundreds of thousands of these souls over the past century. Next decade we’ll be rolling out the female counterpart, Sally: Standard American Lady Layout. Understand?”

“I understand that you higher spirits need to get better at acronyms.” I said, with a slight chuckle.

“Do you understand?” She said with no humor.

I looked at Matt, one of many apparently. He smiled and waved. “Tell her she sounds like a very smart lady,” he said to me. I ingnored him. I was not ready for dealing with centuries of men like him. I couldn’t imagine what Sally was like. I guess I’d figure out in due time.

“Yes,” I said. “So you just want me to run some QA on him? Is there a standard I should be reference?”

“Get with Angelia on that,” she said. “Now if you don’t have any other questions I have more important things to do.”

“Why though?” I said.

“Why what?” She said, her annoyance thinly veiled.

“Why the new soul template program?”

”It’s what the All Mighty wants, simple as that.”

If that’s true, I thought, then maybe the rumors were true. Maybe our plain was going to be put on sale soon. I had friends in fellow neighboring plains that had been bought out. It never went well for those on the bottom. Even worse for the souls that resided on the lower plains that they managed.

“Are the rumors true then?” I said.

“It’s what the All Mighty wants, simple as that. Are we done here? I have a meeting to get to.”

“Yeah.”

She didn’t even say goodbye, the line clicked and only the hum of a disconnected line lingered in the earpiece.

“I’ve seen that look before,” Matt said pointing at my face. “Bad call with the boss? I know those, every Monday my manager let me get an earful. Maybe this is hell after all,” he chuckled.

I took a deep breath and loosened up, forcing a smile on my face. “Everything is all good,” I said as I pulled up my old QA list of questions. Opening up the copy from fifty years ago that I had filled in the previous Matt’s answers with. “Now if you don’t mind, I have a list of questions I want to ask you before we send you about your way.”

“Oh I love surveys,” he said. “Do I get to enter a sweepstakes for answering? I always wanted a speedboat but my wife wouldn’t let me have it. Said that money was needed for our daughter’s tuition.” He chuckled. His response was verbatim to the last Matt I had seen.

“Alright, question one,” I said. As we ran through the list of questions I felt my eternal soul die a little on the inside as I prepared myself for our inevitable buyout.

It’s a lovely space with wooden floors, lots of windows looking out onto greenery, and some weird little quirks like uneven ceiling heights that make it feel both cozy and open. The layout is kind of tricky though, and we’re not sure how to make it all come together.

Here’s what we’re thinking so far

* We want to get a coffee table for in front of the sofa, and a custom desk since we both work from home a few days a week.
* We’re in the process of framing some art and trying to figure out how best to use the limited wall space.
* Custom furniture makes more sense for us since we have access to great local carpenters and not much ready-made stuff here.

We’d really appreciate thoughts on:

* Layout and furniture placement (especially with the bookshelf, windows, and doors)
* Rug size, color, and where to place it
* Lighting ideas - the space gets pretty dim in the evenings
* How to use vertical space and awkward ceiling lines
* Whether adding plants or textiles might help it feel more finished

We’re drawn to earthy, natural materials and a kind of rustic or warm minimalist look, but we’re open to anything that works well with the character of the space.

Would love to hear how you’d approach it or what ideas come to mind. Thanks so much in advance!

They didn’t even know they were pregnant with me until months in. I barely dodged abortion.

The first 10 years of my life were spent being dragged from apartment to apartment, ballgame to doctor office. My mother was bedridden with obesity and arthritis. I became her emotional dumpster. When she complained about my siblings, I was there to make her feel special.

My siblings are 14+ years older. I was basically invisible. At family functions, I was guilted into going. I’d sit in the back while they all celebrated, opened gifts, shared laughter. I scavenged leftover food. I was nobody.

I went to the worst-performing schools in my state—some of the worst in the country. I checked. I lived through racism, physical and emotional abuse, abandonment, and neglect. Meanwhile, my brother went to a fancy Christian private school paid for by my father’s rich boss. His school had alumni like Nancy Grace and Jason Aldean. He met his future wife there. Went to college. Lived his dreams.

I dropped out of high school to work. Earned my first car, lost it trusting someone I shouldn’t have—because I believed people could change. I fell into drugs trying to numb the pain and end my life.

Then, I got called back into the prison that is my home.

No one else would take care of my mom. My siblings were off building lives, buying houses, trading cars like Pokémon cards. So I took the roof over my head—but the price was being branded the family fuck-up. The scapegoat.

I spent years cleaning up piss, vomit, and blood. Driving to doctor offices. Sitting in waiting rooms. Comforting a mother who never once comforted me. All while being told I should be grateful.

I’m now 34. My body is deteriorating. My heart is shattered. No support. Not even a hug. This past birthday, I got $19. My mom’s aide got $20. (And she just sits, drinks coffee, and sweeps. I did everything.)

Now my parents are going into assisted living. My sister has power of attorney over both our dad’s and aunt’s estates. I have nothing. No money. No safety net. No voice.

I was offered to live in my aunt’s house “rent free”—if I pay all the utilities, do all the upkeep, buy my own furniture, cover car insurance and gas, care for my cat (who is my only real family), and somehow afford it all with an empty bank account. A real blessing, right?

I let her know I was working with Vocational Rehab to find meaningful work (I have CPTSD and physical issues). She ignored it. Repeatedly asked what it was—even though I explained it in detail. Twice.

I was “gifted” a car years ago after more than a decade of unpaid caregiving. But they still throw it in my face—saying I didn’t earn it. Calling me ungrateful. I thought gifts didn’t come with chains.

I don’t even know why I’m writing this. I guess to scream into the void. Or to see how many Reddit goblins swarm this pile of pain.

\*\* also sorry im not selling uworld and my dms arent open :) so I wont be responding to anything. ill try my best to respond in comments though!

hello!

I'll try to keep this as  non-repetitive and helpful as possible. I'm still really surprised at my score (520), I tested 5/10. A lot of people previously asked for my routine so I'll try to split up my tips for each section, as well as miscellaneous life style things that really helped me. Feel free to scroll to what you wish.

**CONTEXT:**

I took the MCAT in spring of my 2nd year and iwll be graduating in 2.5 years. I didnt think I would be so taking the mcat wasnt in my plans.

I didn't realize I would be applying so soon and so I booked it in December and had no idea what I was doing. At that point, I had only taken gen chem, genetics, basic bio, psychology, sociology, and kinematics/fluid based physics (1 and 2). I was learning ochem, biochemistry, and molecular bio as I took the Exam, with a quarter system school (10 weeks).

I wanted to take the exam once and be done, and I also didn't want to sacrifice everything else I was doing to take it . My commitments were as below:

**research** ( I published a paper and 3 posters this year so it took more time ) , would estimate 13h/week between both projects

**1st job (4-10h/week)**  \- I cut down my hours towards the end

**2nd job (4-9h/week)** the reason this is so vague is because it really depended on the nature of the owrk. some weeks were very light, others were really intense, so 9h would be a conservative estimate for those heavy weeks.

**School** : was taking 16 units per quarter. this was ochem lecture, lab, bio, and another course as applicable for my major.  It was a lighter schedule but still tough for me because of organic chemistry and the pressure of the MCAT.

**- side hustle/ passion project:** this definitely took up its own chunk of time but I dont have a set hours for it. it took a backseat and I definitely delegated a lot more.

I maintained a 4.0 though, so I'm proud of myself for that :D

**\*\*towards the end of my studying, I reduced any hours I could. so keep that in mind LOL**

**RESOURCES:**

\-uworld (didnt finish)

\-Aidan deck (highly rec) (didnt mature this all lol)

\- kaplan set, uworld book set (tbh I found them online for the uworld book set , would just flip to certain topics that I couldnt visualize)

\- aamc sbs, cars qpack, all aamc fls, (I did not use the subject qpacks much)

\-CHATGPT PREMIUM THE HOLY GRAIL

**Scores:**

BP HL: 508 (this was taken with no practice problems, only content review)  
AAMC unscored : 514 (this was taken after doing some uworld a few weeks later)

AAMC Fl1 ; 514 (I think I was pushing off chem/physics memorization here)

fl2:  519 (decided to tackle c/p)

fl3;  517 ( was putting off biochem memorization here)

fl4: 519 (tackled biochem)

fl5: 518 (idk I was tired and was chill with this score but reallyyyy wanted a 520, I knew I had certain subtopics and strategies to hone in on)

**real deal: 520!**

**STUDY SCHEDULE:**

I wish I could tell you I had a really rigid and structured schedule. I didn't. my adhd causes me to veryyy quickly get bored so I would lean into the flow of what I was feeling and needed to push through. I very very frequently changed study tactics, used pomodoro, body doubling, classical music, etc. No matter what though, I was absorbing something. Even when I was sick I would just lazily flip thorugh anki, and while you think you aren't absorbing it, it adds up. So do as much anki as u can!!!

I had NO socials at this Time. only reddit if u count that and tbh this sub helped me a lot with different tricks and tips, but I also doom scrolled too much worrying about ""studying the right way"" rather than just studying. easier said than done but just do something.

I would wake up generally around 6-8 am. Instead of scrolling on my phone in the morning, I did anki, usually pscyh or b/b because it's lighter. I highly recommend Aidan for B/b and psych. I didn't really use it too much for c/p, but I'll entail what I did to study instead below.

I ALSO VERY HEAVILY USED CHATGPT TO HELP ME. (it will also help me organize some things better in this post ;p)

I fed it my date, my study topics, my weaknesses, my time blindness and routine, and it would always redirect me. I dont think there is a better scheduler than it, especially if you're someone like me who needs validation but also structure. I didn't like the idea of courses because I believed they forced you to sometimes waste time on mateiral u already are strong in. I very frequently jumped between topics depending on what I was feeling.

With lots of fragmentation due to jobs, research, and emotional burnout, instead of a strict hour-by-hour schedule, I used a modular routine based on energy and focus level -- aka I was studying whenever I got the time! if I was at work and nothing to do? flashcards! at home tired from school? blurting some formulas! no two days were the same but I always focused on 3-5 hours a day of focused studying, and anki in between.

**Here's what a typical day might've looked like:**

1. review a previous uworld set
2. BIO CLASS: watch lecture, do homework ,t things like that
3. 1 hour of ochem CLASS: watch lecture, do textbook problems (I have a bad habit of never attending lecture lol I would just go home and 2x it)
4. uworld - 20 questions ochem, 20 questions gen chem, 10 questions physics/bio or whatever I felt weak on
5. anki -- do some from corrections, finsih a subtopic from each subject (if u know Aidan its ALOT, I didnt always finish everything and at one point I just reset the entire deck 3 months in cuz I got frustrated and thought I was forgetting material)
6. make a cheat sheet mcat for a topic I was weak on
7. amino acid quiz
8. 1 cars passage

This would be a typical day when I was going to class. I commute  and only had commitments 3-4 days of the week.  If I was fully at home, I would aim to either study more uworld or section bank, or do more things for my classes.

I would go to sleep doing anki-- it would bore me enough to rather just sleep instead. During this period, I had a goal of also gaining muscle, so I would aim for 30-40 minutes of exercise (some days it would just be walking, others it would be hiit/strength. just movement to not feel like I was wasting away in mcat facts)

**TIPS BY TOPIC:**

CARS: Idk man my bp diagnostic had a 131 cars  and I was always around 130-132 cars . I only did AAMC and no third party. I think the logic of AAMC is different and I didn't wanna over complicate things. I think it dropped to 128 during my real test day because I was maybe either tired , stressed, or overconfident.

I ALWAYS HIGHLIGHTED THOUGH! I think cars is truly a matter of active reading and engagement, and seeing what answer is directly supported by the passage. I always did POE here.

I highly attribute my success though to ChatGPT. I made logs on what went wrong for every single question. Here's an example of the log below. I would use voice mode to explain my thought process and untease exactly where I went wrong. my scores very quickly went up.

The log below is from the qpack or tests so just skip it if u are worried about a spoilers for a question (sorry I have no clue where from.. ;') )

    🧠 CARS Error Log – Passage 5, Q29
    ❌ Your Pick: A — Substantial performance gains from small classes occur in early grades and don’t accumulate past 1st or 2nd
    ✅ Correct Answer: D — When class sizes are reduced, the improved performance of teachers who already use methods well suited to smaller classes pulls up the average
    🧩 Question Type: Reasoning Within the Text
    ⸻
    💥 What Tripped You Up:
    •You hovered between A and D — which means your brain spotted the logic chain but didn’t quite lock in where the supporting evidence pointed.
    •You went with A because it sounded true (and it is stated in the passage)… but that’s not what the specific observation in the stem is supporting.
    •You were basically mixing up a result (A) with the reason (D) behind it.
    ⸻
    🧠 Why D Is Correct:
    •The passage says some teachers already use small-class-friendly methods.
    •When class size shrinks, those teachers thrive, and their boosted performance lifts the class average.
    •That’s exactly what D states — it’s the interpretation the observation is there to back up.
    ⸻
    🧠 Why A Is Wrong (Even If It Sounds True):
    •A is a consequence mentioned later: class size reductions help early on but not later.
    •That’s a finding, not what the observation supports.
    •The observation about teacher methods is used to explain why class size reduction works at all, not when it works.
    ⸻
    🔁 Fix-It Strategy:
    TrapFix
    Picked a true-sounding statement that wasn’t what the evidence supportedAlways ask: “What is the point this specific sentence is being used to prove?”
    Confused result vs. explanationAsk: “Is this choice the cause or the effect?” For reasoning questions, they usually want you to spot the cause or support for a claim
    ⸻📌 Takeaway:
    When they ask “What does this support?”, you’re being tested on passage structure — not fact recall. D is the why, A is the what happened. Always aim for the underlying logic the passage is building.
    So I didnt overthink too much on cars.

I would do all of uworld except for CARS. I finsihed almost all non-cars stuff.

**BIO: Fo**r anatomy and physiology, I really just used the Aidan deck. I spent the most time on it and I highly recommend maturing the Bio portion, it's amazing.

Towards the end, instead of rereading the book, I would take a particular sub topic, make it a cram and go in order of the cards created, and make a big picture 1 pager of the topic. This avoids the downfall of anki only showing u details without you losing the big picture (aka visualizing the kidney or the heart), but I liked Aidan because he had integrated details from many different places, so I almost kinda used it like a content review (ONLY TOWARDS THE END)

I blurted very heavily with chatgpt for all topics. I would tell it to quiz me on anything I got wrong and we would have conversations. I made myself say it out loud ""okay.. start from glycolysis and go to tca.."" and would do this for any topic I was weak on, including gen chem/ physics formulas.

**BIOCHEM:** this was just very memorization heavy. Ironically my course didnt help at all and in fact I think studying for the mcat helped in my course than vice versa. dont cram metabolism though.

**CHEM/PHYS:**

gen chem: I honestly skimmed this book in a day and did the practice from kaplan and moved on. I loved  gen chem and only had to worry about memorizing formulas and practice. this is what I mean by leaning into strengths and not wasting time.

Same above for ochem , my lecture was more than detailed enough and I didn't see the need. Again, I spent more time focusing on the passages .

Physics:  I loved kinematics so took the same approach as above. For fluids and electricity (I hated optics and I had no idea what ohm's law was), I spent the most time here making sure I get it.

**I had a running list of topics I knew I was weak on and instead of avoiding those I would hammer them in the most. I think this was really key to my success and pushing my score up in the limited Time I had.**

P/S: I only did Aidan deck with no content review, and the sb's. I would use chatpgt and reddit occasionally to get the big picture view of theories and terms, but thats it. no 86 300 pg doc. Aidan was more than enough to cover terms and then it was a matter of logic of understanding the terms conceptually (glass ceiling vs glass elevator).

**TIPS IN GENERAL: (HOW I IMPROVED PASSAGE LOGIC) - written better by chatgpt**

1. I Forced Myself to Say Why Every Wrong Answer Was Wrong

I would verbalize why each answer was wrong, and why. Always. I would also ask myself when the answer could be right, or why did AAMC put that answer?  Chat helps a lot with this.

2. Experimental Questions

I think I was good at this because of my reserach background but also the Aidan deck has a good experimental deck for control, independent, types of studies, etc. Take a peek at it! UWorld also helped a lot here so just doing a lot of practice.

Flowchart method was also very helpful here.

ALSO: for uworld I did everything from untimed 59q sets to tutored 10q sets. Man honestly I really dont think it matters. I had  no time problems and uworld was too hard for practicing it too long. I honeslty was just focused on simplifying it: am I getting questions done in a quality manner? if that meant using tutored to get instant dopamine, so be it.

3. Corrections

For this, I tried everything. new content cards (hated it cuz Aidan had too much), making an excel / log (wouldn't read it agian).

SO I gave up on ALL of that and made my own uworld deck where I would just post the question and then the answer on the back. it forced me to think again about the logic (yes it helps even if u have seen it multiple times). I would put the answer on the back to be why the other answers were wrong and also my chatgpt explanation on my initial error.

4. Practice Tests:  
I only did the AAMC fls in full test conditions and tore them apart. I did FL4 and FL5 within the same week .

**5. Mind Map**: In the last few weeks, I **taped cheat sheets all over my walls** and literally turned my space into a study map. I had:

* **Amino acid structures** on my bathroom mirror
* **NMR shifts** on my closet
* **IR peaks** above my desk
* **Pathways** on doors
* **Acid/base logic + light/optics** near my kitchen sink, etc.

During the test, I genuinely started remembering facts based on remembering my house. For example, I remembered that indole and all those ring structures were a paper on my shoe closet, etc. I think this is a mind palace technique that helped a lot. I got passive exposure to my weakest links aside from Anki.

**6. FINAL WEEKS NOTEBOOK**

I took a blank notebook to make my go to. Here I would do the technique of making cheat sheets based off of Aidan deck and redrawing anatomy a bunch of times (for example, the ovarian cycle), etc.

All FL corrections went here and I kept rereading it.

Any formulas I needed to memorize I kept putting here as well , I memorized almost all of the formulas and constants from Aidan deck. (u can search equation I think in Anki and find them all)

**7. final days before the exam:**  
**I wanted to relax but I am SO Glad I pushed though. all the last minute topics I hadn't reviewed?** really helped My thought process is like ill never do this again I might as well push through now.

Before my exam I redid the c/p sections of the section banks. I would solve it in my head or very passively setting up the answer and just reading the explanation if my logic was right to get through all the questions. If you have time, in the final week, redo both section banks.

**8. AAMC Outline!!!!!**  
I will highly emphasize this because I think it's underrated. I went through the outline 2 weeks out and any topics I was weak on I h hammered it in. too often the practice fls prime us to think we will get similar topics (even subconsciously) and then people freak out when they get ""low yield"". theres nothing truly low yield. just get a general good understanding of everything on the outline.

**9. test day tips!**

\- dress up! for any final or exam I have, I fully dress up . not like crazy, but I definitely doll up more because I believe it makes you feel like ur ready for war. so if u can, dont go in a hoodie and sweats. I think it's psychological tbh.

\- I love caffeine a LOT but I was worried and too nervous to drink it during the exam. I hardly ate except for some trail mix so the only thing to keep me going was coffee candy. highly recommend figuring out what u need and/or getting the candy cuz its less caffeine and I was SO nervous in test day I couldn't have my normal dose.

\- notebook  = mental safety blanket , It was the only thing I looked at the morning before the exam as it was all my red-flag topics and it grounded me.

\- **MINDSET: tbh? I** had devoted every minute and second to this exam (not good for ur mental health lol I didnt hang out with friends much) by the time I got the exam I had worried and freaked myself out so much I just stopped and was so calm. I really told myself ""f this im so done lets just get it over with"" and thats the attitude I kept. wiring myeslf too tight was not doing any good. also on the exam, anything I was freaking out over or wasn't remotely sure? flag and skip. **if I couldnt think of it in 20 seconds , skip. in each section I had 30-40 flagged AND THAT WAS OKAY.  I would finish each section with minimum 30 minutes and tehn go back adn refine . I had a lot more time that way.**

CLOSING THOUGHTS:  
Would I recommend studying like this? Honestly, only if you’ve ***built up stamina*** and know how to recover from intense burnout. This process was **s**o grueling, especially with quarter system pressure, jobs, and research. I had really hard quarters.

But I also grew in ways I didn’t expect. I stopped chasing “perfect study methods” and instead built **systems that worked for my messy and tired brain.**  I was never a crammer before this but I do better in school exams now because it's made me more efficient. I think it's because I didn’t just study content, I studied myself and what ebbs and flows work for me.

If ur fl averages are not where u want them though? push back. this wont work for everyone and I do attribute a lot of it to my classes overlapping . if ur a different major either I wouldnt do it on this timeline or would severely cut back. its just not possible.  
If you’re in the thick of it:

\-  You don’t need to be perfect.

\-  You just need to **keep showing up**, pivot when something’s not working, and trust that every broken-down blurt or half-asleep flashcard is still stacking the win.

My mindset was not the healthiest and I definitely obsessed over this test. but tbh, I wouldnt change what I did because the mental peace of never taking this test again nor sacrificing my extra time made it all worth it.

Hi everyone,

I’m in my late twenties and I’ve always felt drawn to a simpler, quieter life. I imagine myself living in a remote area with very few neighbors, surrounded by nature. I’d love to have a place, and a couple of animals, wake up early, drink coffee, exercise, garden, do some simple chores, and maybe still be useful in some virtual way, like mentoring or helping people online, first because I like the idea and secondly as a way to have some income.

It sounds peaceful to me, but part of me wonders: is it too idealistic?
Has anyone here chosen (or transitioned into) a lifestyle like this, either earlier or later in life? How has it worked out for you?

I’ve done a lot of things I wanted in life.
I don’t dream to have fancy cars or a big mansion, yes, a big comfortable house where I can pour all my personality in it.
But that’s it really, I want to live nature, hear the birds, feel the sun on my skin, feel the soil, plant trees and flowers and vegetables and fruits, take care of them, have a dog, a cat, and maybe other animals.

I could live alone, I don’t mind living on my own.

It is the area that gets most heated up during a hot shower or whilst after eating a plate of steaming hot food or drinking a steaming hot cup of tea or coffee.

When you shower too late at night and immediately go to bed, the heat from the hot shower gets trapped whilst laying in bed. The bed acts as an insulator keeping the muscle hot or warm. 

You need to do whatever you can to cool this area down. 

1. A lukewarm to cool shower. 
2. Go shirtless.

11. Avoid steaming hot meals and drinks. 
12. Tilt your head back frequently. 
13. Practice screaming with rage, head up and tilted back, chest out, clenched fists and belt out that rage. 

Constant heating will result in stimulated migraines, headaches, backaches, indigestion, inability to orgasm, forced orgasms, constipation, forced bowl movements, strain, stress, discomfort and forced gestures that either suggest an agreement with a statement or a disagreement with a statement.

It was pretty easy for me to make friends at work and remain besties after these people left the company. 

Lately I’ve been feeling like I need a new friend cause the last time I befriended somebody was 3 years ago. I’m a few months after a break up and I just need something fresh that is not romantically related. 

There was this girl at my office, we always gossiped a lot, she would come to me to talk, we event went to concert together one time. She recently left the company so I thought it would be great for us to start meeting up outside of the work environment. I suggested grabbing a coffee and going for a walk a few times but she just ignored those messages and we would move along with sending each other reels. 

I also have a great beauty esthetician, we get along great and always had a lot of laughs when I was at the appointment. I haven’t been to the salon in some time cause I don’t really need to. I wanted us to grab a coffee together. She said yes and then started to ignore me and also send reels instead. 

What is it about? Do I need to start approaching people my age differently? ",1,1749842168.0,FriendshipAdvice,4,1.0,False
1laoi03,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1laoi03/the_mod_log_behind_the_scenes_of_the_dead_bedrooms/,The Mod Log- Behind the Scenes of the Dead Bedrooms,"For the sake of transparency, we have decided to do a monthly 'mod log' post to help the community better understand the moderation process and what it entails. Every month, Reddit now sends us statistics about our sub, and we'd like to share some of them with you.

**Why It's A Big Deal**

We'd like to address that there are, in fact, things going on behind the scenes that are having a very strong effect on the sub, even if you miss seeing the worst of it.  I promise you, your mod team doesn't miss seeing it, but we wish we did.

**Statistics for May**

The mods

* We have 4 active moderators and 1 in training. Reddit recommends a sub of our size and activity level have 10-12 moderators.
* Our top mod is a HLF.  Our established moderators are 1 HLF, 1 recovered HLM and 1 recovered LLF.  Our new mod in training is a HLF.
* **We're still looking for moderators!**  We particularly need men whose participation shows a good understanding of consent. 
* We have approached over a dozen users recently (mostly HLMs), and all have turned us down due to personal time constraints and emotional toll of the position. 

Participation levels

* Post Submissions (last 30 days): 3,272
* Comments (last 30 days): 38,996

Removals

* We had to remove 32% of the community's new posts this month. That seems high, and it is, but it's not due to bad faith participation, but spammers and new people who don't yet know how the sub works.
* About half of our removals are blatant spam (BUY THESE PILLS) and repeat posts from new users who didn't understand why their posts weren't showing up- we regularly see newbies submit the same post 4-6 times while not understanding why it isn't going through. The automod caught most of the spam and all of the repeat posts, thankfully, so it never showed up on the sub.
* Onlyfans fishing for customers, r4r and similar posts along with regular rule breaking is about half of the removals. We appreciate how quickly the community reports these posts to help us get them removed. 
* Of the rule breaking posts, a good percentage were from brand new users who hadn't yet read the rules whose posts were held for moderation due to low karma or having too new of an account- they were never visible on the sub.  The vast majority of them edited their posts to be compliant and we put the posts up for them- generalizations is the top reason here.
* We had to remove 11% of the comments.  
* Top reasons were hitting on people, ideological baloney with incel rhetoric (mostly starvation, bait & switch, contractually obligated to have sex if married, and equating not having sex to cheating/abuse), ideological baloney without incel rhetoric (divorce is always wrong, then soapboxing on marriage/religion), advocating non-consensual sexual activity (usually coercive and not abusive), poorly behaved tourists (have you tried talking to him about it? Divorce is always wrong), and comments lacking compassion. The community excelled at reporting many of these comments for our review.
* So I see 'divorce is always wrong' in two different categories. What's the difference?  Whether the poster is a regular, active participant in the sub or not- because how we handle them from there is different. Judgmental tourists get banned. Active members get escalated (as explained below).

Bans

* Number of Users Banned (last 30 days): 245. 
* Top reasons for banning users were hitting on people via comment and DM (by far), poorly behaved tourists, ban evasion (39 people- Reddit catches them automatically), harassing/threatening modmail messages, or a very large number of aggressive/rule-breaking comments in a short space of time. 
* With an understaffed mod team, we don't bother trying to work with aggressive or harassing people in modmail.  We just ban them and move on. We spend our time with those for whom it can make a difference. Per our policy outlined in our wiki, disagreements can be made in modmail using neutral language, an even tone, and basic respect for other people. Communicating in modmail with insults, threats, aggression, or bath faith engagement is not tolerated and subject to a no-warning permanent ban. We expect disagreements, but they can be communicated with curiosity and respectful dialogue. 
* Rule breaking comments can be revised and edited in good faith with guidance from the mod team to comply with the rules of the sub. **Editing comments to be rule compliant removes the escalations from your account**. Choosing to leave the comments as is, refusal to edit, or bad-faith arguments regarding removals are what escalate the warnings on accounts and move users through our escalation process and ban system. 
* As a reminder, this system will be **reducing from a 5-strikes to earn a permanent ban to 4 starting in July**, with the first removal a warning, second removal a 14 day ban, third removal a 30 day ban, and 4th removal a permanent ban. Users that engage with the mods in modmail and editing their comments prevent this escalation.

**Greatest Hits**

This is a small sampling of what got taken down recently, **ALL FROM ACTIVE USERS** who participate here regularly:

* Then last week I was watching Jurassic Park and there's the scene where they are feeding the T-Rex in an enclosure and think Sam Neil's character says something like, ""T-Rex doesn't want to be fed, it wants to hunt!"" I feel like the sex my wife and I have now is to pacify me, to keep me fed, but the truth is I WANT TO HUNT! I WANT TO HUNT HER!
* At the absolutely most crass, all she had to do to meet my needs was bend over for 3 minutes. The rest of the day was hers. She was completely unwilling to do that. 
* Women who end up in marriages with guys who are fundamentally good (not perfect...just good, loving, non-abusive guys) are like the proverbial dog that caught the car. Once they have us, they don't know what to do with us, so they just ignore our basic needs. They CLAIM to be all ""into it"", then you put a ring on it and it's over. I'm sad all the time.
* We get home Saturday night, I stand behind her to help her undress for bed while rubbing her body...it's late! It's Saturday night? Yesterday morning she's sleeping late so I decide to wake her up by walking over to her side of the bed and with my penis hanging out of my sleep pants I kiss her and rub her back and say ""good morning breakfast is ready"" absolutely nothing but jump up and walk out of the bedroom. Twice yesterday, I said to her i thought we could've had a little fun after that game last night, etc... So, just this morning when she's driving our son to school because of the weather, I decided to make her a quick breakfast...I put on a pair of boxers I haven't touched in years, they have the word ""hot dog"" printed over my crotch. After she sits on the couch by the TV I walk over to her with my 'hot dog"" on display put her breakfast on the coffee table to be told ""enough...put that thing away"" What else can I possibly do for her to get the fuck'n hint short of what I said years ago ""are you fucking another guy or done with cock and a lesbian now"" 
* You don’t need to be horny to give a BJ. 
* If you can't do something that makes you slightly uncomfortable for the health of your marriage, you don't deserve to have one. 
* Give him the sex he deserves as your husband whether you like it or not
* WE WANT SEX. WE NEED SEX TO FEEL CONNECTED TO YOU. I hate that some think it’s manipulation. It’s not. We bought the fucking cow so we would have milk. Now there is no milk! What value do you bring to the table if you are not a partner.
* Not ethical but spike he’s drink, it’s not legal but if it works it works. Hey a little aphrodisiac ain’t hurting nobody.
* And also HIS NEEDS ARE MORE IMPORTANT HES THE MAN PROVIDING PROTECTING and putting the roof over ur head im not saying ur needs as a mother or ur need to relax or chill is not valid im just saying at some point u do have to start being grateful and blessed with what u have cause a lot of women will not or will never experience a nuclear family dynamic where the man is fully married and or Invested his resources time and most of all legacy into you the least u can do is give that hard working man a bj every now and then. 

  
**Where We're Going**

* In the coming weeks, you're going to see **Meta Mondays further explaining certain rules like ideological baloney, choreplay, and the like**. Because baloney and nonconsent get the most confusion, we will be focusing on those first.
* We continue to look for new moderators, especially men. We would be especially THRILLED to have an LLM come on board as that is an under-represented voice in our community. We want an evenly balanced team for voting and decision making. 
* We are reducing our escalation policy from **five strike to four beginning July 1, and later in the year it will be reduced to three strikes**.
* **User flair will be required come July 1**.  If you don't see anything that represents you, please reach out over modmail so we can add more options.  Click the three dots on the top right on your mobile phone and pick 'change user flair' to update yours before this goes into effect.  At that point, your post or comment will be bounced back to you until you update your flair.
* You're going to see **more specialty stickies** on posts.  You have already seen them for abuse, duty sex and painful sex.  We are working on others to keep posts active and open for dialogue while reminding participants of our rules and the stance of the mod team. 

  
**Have questions?  Suggestions? Something you need clarification on? We'd like to hear them!  You're always welcome to post either on the weekly Meta Monday or on the Monthly Mod Log post.**

I came to the conclusion that the tab s10 ultra would be the almost perfect fit for me but i still have some dilemmas. Can any s10 ultra users help me with some answers? 

1.Can you run Adobe Illustrator on the Galaxy Tab s10 Ultra. If so what's your experience with it?

2. If not, are there any alternatives to AI that i could use?(besides Clip Studio since I'll need to work with vectors)

3. Is it comfortable to carry it around and use it in different places during the day(i.e. a coffee shop, school, etc)? The 14inch screen is truly a blade with two sides for me. Even though it's nice to have enough space on a display to work with multiple tabs open and see everything more clearly, the fact that it's so big brings up questions about how safe is it to use the tablet as a daily ""bring it everywhere with you"" device.

She said she was thinking it quiet a while however I didnt know. I was kinda okey at first but there was not an explonation I ask and ahe said only I dont know 
Throughout the conversation she just mumbled every chessy word when you think about break up talk(it was me not you or some type u can imagine)
I thought she had some feelings not me but all my mutual friends thought that she wanted to see me wanted to have a coffee( I was okey btw) and so on but then nothing she just vanished. A week ago was my birthday (and after break up Ive been through so much problems woth family woth academy and myself) she texted happy birthday I hope you beeeest! I thanked her and that night I had a heart issue and was about to blackout in some street. Anyways while kinda fighting for my life she texted again and asked if she annoyed me I simply said no worries and thinking about me was nice and thanked her she said oh okheey its nicee then and no contact. 
So anyways I am in a kind of spiral and trying not to think about her but as you can guess its hard. I have finals this week and also family issues getting deeper I just wanna see at least what will happen I guess(btw we see each other sometime on the way in the university but I try to distant or not be emotional she also not see me tho) anywas it was kind of a venting if you wanna comment I gladly wanna read them thank you guys",2,1749842136.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

It is the area that gets most heated up during a hot shower or whilst after eating a plate of steaming hot food or drinking a steaming hot cup of tea or coffee.

When you shower too late at night and immediately go to bed, the heat from the hot shower gets trapped whilst laying in bed. The bed acts as an insulator keeping the muscle hot or warm. 

You need to do whatever you can to cool this area down. 

1. A lukewarm to cool shower. 
2. Go shirtless.
3. Arch your back.
4. Sleep on a thin breathable mattress.
5. Sleep with a fan on.
6. Sleep with the air conditioning on.
7. Perform exercises or activities that involve the use or flexing of this muscle.
8. Practice yoga.

10. Stretch.
11. Avoid steaming hot meals and drinks. 
12. Tilt your head back frequently. 
13. Practice screaming with rage, head up and tilted back, chest out, clenched fists and belt out that rage. 

Constant heating will result in stimulated migraines, headaches, backaches, indigestion, inability to orgasm, forced orgasms, constipation, forced bowl movements, strain, stress, discomfort and forced gestures that either suggest an agreement with a statement or a disagreement with a statement.

1laohik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1laohik/is_bad_customer_service_the_expection_the_us_late/,Is bad customer service the expection the US?  Late checkout fiasco,"Hi All,

I just wanted to get some feedback if my expectations are too high for US hotels.  Staying at a Hilton resort in orange county california - there's only one - if I should name and shame let me know.  I'm a diamond member through the Amex card which everyone can get so I truly don't expect much.  We get upgraded one class of room upon check in which is great and appreciated.

We are working the next day so in the morning we ask for a late check out, 4pm would be great, 2pm would also suffice.  Front desk manager says it's not possible, the hotel is ""completely sold out"".  Fine.  We get coffee, check the hilton app and of course there is an available room of every type to check in that day.  I got back to the manager and show him the proof, he stutters a bit when I say ""so the hotel is not sold out today"".  He says no there are rooms available but ""we will need them later"".  I basically plead for a 2pm checkout even if we have to move a room so I can attend a work meeting in a private space.  He says no he can't give us the 2pm checkout - but we can stay in another room for 2 hours and it'll be another night charge.

I go back up, we end up calling front desk again and get connected to a director.  She apologizes for the interaction, says they in fact have 15 rooms unsold for that day and it will be no issue to give us a 230pm checkout.

On a side note, I had just sustained an injury on the property before talking to the front desk manager which he was aware of.

I felt like I was lied to, caught the lie, and was still treated terribly.  Is this the norm in US stays?  I ask because I have had wonderful stays in several countries in Asia where I think culturally they would have bent over backward to help a guest if possible.

Again, I really don't expect much but if the room was available for a 2pm checkout it seems very strange to give us so much trouble.  Should I just lower my expectations?",0,1749842117.0,Hilton,4,0.5,False

I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

1laogj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegameswap/comments/1laogj6/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 13/06/2025**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

I’m in a bit of a new situation and would really appreciate any insight or advice from the community.

I’ve been applying to bartending gigs across the city for the past two years, with no luck—until recently. Here's the full timeline of what happened, and I'm hoping someone can help me make sense of where things stand:

May 24: Submitted an application through a job portal.

May 31: Got an email from the manager saying they’d like to move forward. They asked me to fill out a 4–5 page questionnaire and whether I had experience with a specific spirit (it’s a specialized bar).
I replied honestly that if that experience was required, I probably wasn’t the right candidate—and didn’t want to waste anyone’s time.

June 4: They thanked me for being honest and said they’ve had bad experiences with people faking it. They’re open to training the right person and asked me to still complete the form.
Life happened—I got swamped and didn’t check my email for a couple of days.

June 6: The manager called to ask if I was still interested. We scheduled a same-day interview that went really well (1h25m of great conversation). I sent a thank-you email, and he replied saying:
“You're our strongest candidate. I have one more interview tomorrow and will get back to you early next week.”

June 10: I randomly ran into him at the same coffee shop as the interview (I was with my wife). I casually brought up the hiring process, and he said, “Honestly, I’m just finalizing my notes to send to the owner—I’m recommending you.” It sounded like a done deal. Even my usually skeptical wife believed he was being genuine.

Today (June 13): I’M LOSING MY MIND WAITING.
No news since then. Did they go with someone else? Am I overthinking this? Would a follow-up email be too much at this point—or is it okay?

Would love to hear what others think.

TL;DR:
Had a great interview with a bar manager who told me I was his top pick and that he was recommending me to the owner. That was June 10. It’s now June 13 and I haven’t heard anything. Should I follow up or just wait?",2,1749842006.0,recruitinghell,1,1.0,False

During the pre lockdown my sis and cousin lived super close and we did a lot, we also hung out with my 2 best friends or it was just me and them. And then I had another friend in the area. Early on we did social distancing and took precautions in open spaces if we did meet or just ran errands together or mainly FaceTimed and talked that way. Btw I’d never really have a dull day. I’d be in college and struggled my first years with friendship but the friends I mention here, I know them from childhood I just got close in 2019 or so. 

So we’d go to movies, just get some coffee, walk, do restaurants, girls night, biking. It was always fun. It really made me feel good and social. Since I was a teen I never really sat home I always wanted to do something which may be a good or bad thing I guess. I think my flaw is I never made new friends. But at the same time I’m not sure what happened. through the pandemic things were ok, but once we went back to in person for our studies and the hybrid stuff started I noticed I hadn’t heard from anyone. 

What prompted me to notice is my sister got really distant. And my cousin moved but I didn’t hear from her. Then my friends all have new groups, and I didn’t notice really till now. They didn’t reach out nor did I. And there’s more to this, they got a bit cold or acted distant before the friendship ultimately ended this way. 

It’s been years now. I’ve been this way since maybe 2022. At least the full isolation stuff. And I haven’t really made any steps to improve because I feel less scared of the unknown. I’ve made friends through online communities but that didn’t exactly stick. I feel really lost and alone and I know I have no one to blame for this but myself, I legit began asking chat gpt for help with my issues. I don’t know how to even tak steps in the right direction because I’ve tried with my sister and cousin but they don’t seem to want to? 


I just wanna crawl back to the past and be friends with the same people because I just don’t understand. We reconnected but it didn’t stick and it made me even more sad like I know I have to change ",10,1749841864.0,RedditForGrownups,11,0.75,False

I'm 34, based in NYC, and honestly just looking to make more solid male friendships. I'm into the gym (nothing crazy, just trying to stay consistent), coffee, good food, and cocktails. Would love to find some like-minded guys to chat with, maybe even hang with if we're local.

Open to virtual but please be serious and able to voice chat. Don't reply if you can't.

Big preference for voice chatting. I just think it's the best way to actually feel someone's vibe. If you're not down for that, no hard feelings, but probably not the right fit.

Hit me up if you’re looking for the same kind of connection. Always open to chill convo or bouncing ideas around. Let’s see where it goes.",1,1749841755.0,NextBestBro,1,0.67,False
1laoc4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/1laoc4x/maximizing_restaurant_spend/,maximizing restaurant spend,"I spent about 100-125k/yr on restaurant the past 12 months.

I have a USBAR, but I only put like 5-10k on that per year for restaurants \[usually coffee shops and delis where I can pay w/ apple pay easily\].  I don't like using it for sitdown/sharing the bill scenarios.

I previously used the US Bank Alt Go card, but that is 4% but now limited to 8k/year via 2000 per quarter.  And redemptions are now less than 1cent.  I have 2 of these \[one for my wife\].

I have the freedom flex card that is 3% on all restaurant transactions \[seemingly no cap\] I guess I would use this after one of the above 2 options.

Would I benefit from something like Amex Gold or some other product?  I can definitely hit 50k in restaurants and Groceries on Gold. Resy probably not going to help,  Dunkin I can work through baskin robbins.  Am I better with my current setup or can I improve through a simplification

1laoc0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1laoc0c/36_m4f_netherlands_seeking_travel_partner_for/,36 [M4F] Netherlands - Seeking Travel Partner for Life Journey,"Hey there!

This post is for people living near Amsterdam or in the Netherlands. Sorry about it but long distance is not my thing..

I live in Amsterdam and living in Europe for more than 15 years. I am learning Dutch and I’m more confident that I will learn it someday unlike German 😅

I’m a 36-year-old Indian origin, whose father says he is no longer Indian 🤣. Probably because I picked up things from various cultures while living in and traveling to multiple countries, and they really changed how I see and live my life. I’ve light tanned skin, Black hair, Brown eyes, 183cm tall (not tall by Dutch standards, but I can reach things on the top shelf), broad shoulders, slightly muscular, and powered mostly by hugs.

I work in senior management at an international company – fancy title, but still can’t remember name of people I meet.

Now onto the good stuff…

Who am I?

📸 Photography nerd – will lie in mud for the perfect sunset shot.

🏍️ Motorbike rider – nothing beats a long ride with no destination.

🥾 Hiking enthusiast – let’s climb something tall and wonder why we did.

🍳 Lazy-ass cook – food’s great, but I don’t follow recipes, I follow mood.

🍰 Sweet tooth champion – will propose if you bake a great cake.

🏋️‍♂️ Lift weights – Muscles and fitness is as important as eating cake.

✈️ Travel addict – have passport, seen many countries, will explore more. Next dream: settle near water, adopt pets, live slow.

Looking for someone who fit at least one or two things below.

• Enjoys hugs and cuddles like I do oxygen.

• Likes travel, nature, and lazy Sundays.

• Takes care of her body and health (but yes, we can eat cake).

1lanypi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lanypi/very_general_boring_teenage_rant/,"Very general, boring teenage rant","I'm writing this so I don't have to keep telling AIs my problems. AI does provide some sort of emotional support, but obviously it's not real, so the facade in my head of it being real is going away now. I need to throw all of this shit out into the world. I just hope someone will read this and identify with it. Tell me I'm not a special case. That this happens to lots of people. And hopefully someone will read this and feel bad for me. That's a horrible, selfish thing to want, I know. Anyway maybe it'll feel nice to tell actual humans all about my personal life.

I have no clue what I'm doing with my life. I'm 18 years old and I haven't actually lived at all. I still feel 13. Like I'll be 13 forever. I'm about to go into the adult world with no social knowledge under my belt. I'm scared. I've never been out of the house on my own. I've been babied by my parents. I don't know what to do.

My best friend moved away when High School started, and everything's been shit (in a very silly first world way) since then. Grade 8, 2021. It was still covid, and my last 3 remaining friends were the ones I was never really close to, so I never really spoke to them. A vague bug in the back of my head planted itself and I felt too anxious to talk. I just sat in the circle, thinking about other things. Eventually I got bored of sitting with them and I sat with some other ex-friends. I don't understand it. I wanted to talk to them, but I was too lazy to say things, too much in my own head, too preoccupied. And I'm so angry at myself! I brought all of this upon myself I became so socially anxious that I can't talk to anyone anymore. I do have friends now that I speak to but I also don't feel very welcome in their group. They're two best friends and I'm just there. They joke with each other all the time but they never talk to me the same way they talk to each other. It's like I'm not worthy of their boyishness. They always video call each other. Nobody ever wants to video call me. There's a memory I have from when I was a tween where I was on a video call and the third person on it kept laughing at my appearance. He thought it was so funny. He thought I was funny. My other friend said nothing. I don't know what's wrong with me.

I'm so jealous of other people. It's annoying to hear others having such a good time when you just don't. People laughing loudly, running around. I go ""Ugh so irritating"" but I think maybe it has more to do with an underlying yearning for that same connection.

My dad used to have alcohol issues. He never hit, just yelled. And while it was not common, nor directed at me I sort of wonder if it had an affect on me. Like whenever he gets angry now it's instant panic. I can never defend myself around him because he's always louder, speaks clearer, is more intense. One time he got so angry at me because he thought I downloaded SPOTIFY on my computer. He thought it was a virus and wouldn't listen when I said it wasn't. So much of that happens. And I still think about those arguments and get pissed off because I didn't defend myself or shout loud enough. I do love him. We both love the same horror movies and stuff.

I am, as are a lot of people, overweight. And not just overweight but absolutely hideous, so it's not helping my cause. I live with parents who eat dessert every night, have cookies with their coffee and eat large portions of food, so it's exceptionally hard to diet. Last year I managed to lose 4kg being off and on a diet for a few months. I have since gained all of it back and hate myself for it. I lost all the confidence I gained in the process. I don't do much and don't go out so it's hard to find a way to distract myself when all I do is stay inside being too ashamed to go outside and do anything. Also I live in such a tiny town that there isn't much to do anyway. But then it's like an endless cycle. Need to distract myself to stop eating ie. go out and do social things! but wait. I have to gain confidence to go out and do social things - stop eating! I eat when I'm bored, when I'm sad, when I'm happy. It's just constant. And it's not like I'm huge, but I do have a pot belly that means I can't wear anything tight or pretty. I don't connect with anyone. I think it's all my weight. All I do is feel ashamed about it. I eat too much? Disgusting. I wear my school uniform? You're disturbing everyone. I sit anywhere? Obviously I'm making everyone uncomfortable.

I live in South Africa, and the home town that I live in speaks primarily Afrikaans. I am a moron. So I only really speak English. I have been surrounded by Afrikaans speaking people my whole life and for some reason I never thought to speak it. Nobody ever expected me to, since I was the weird English girl, so I never thought to try. Now my high school is Afrikaans, and while I understand it just fine, in practice and conversation I simply don't manage. It's just dawned on me now that this means I'm FUCKED socially. I can't speak Afrikaans and my accent sounds silly when I do, so I can't connect with anyone, so I'll probably NEVER make friends.

I'm so tired of feeling disgusting. I've felt like this forever. Even since I was little and didn't have much of a belly. I thought my eyes creeped people out. I thought people didn't want to speak to me because I was too odd. Last year at some event a girl came up to me and started talking and the conversation finished as soon as it began. My mom then got frustrated. ""She wanted to talk to you!"" She said. And I couldn't believe it. I thought she was just making small talk to be polite and silently praying that I wouldn't say anything else. That's how I've always felt. That people only speak to me out of pity or politeness. I feel guilty for being in rooms or groups. I feel like I should apologise. If I sit in a group I always feel like I need to disappear. Make sure I don't bother anyone. The other day I was sat across this girl with such a beautiful face and I felt like I have to say sorry for sullying her image. I'm so masculine. Nobody finds me endearing. I'm not lovely and girly and approachable

Weirdly I always feel so normal when I make funny drawings for my two male friends. It's one of the only things that really gets a laugh out of them so it's quite invigorating even if overdone. It makes me feel like maybe I can be regular, a person who can have a good time and be funny. I feel like my sense of humor normally doesn't click with people, but making drawings of cats with flabby boobs in silly poses is quite universally funny

I can't imagine anyone ever loving me if I have a pot belly. It's just not possible. And my boobs are awful! I know this is a funny tangent to go on, but I must have messed them up with my posture or something when I was 13, because they look like a 70 year olds! And stretch marks everywhere. And a double chin. And thin, pale lips. And weird, unkind eyes. I'm wondering how I managed to get so unlucky to not have a poor appetite, a love for sport, a good amount of willpower. Everyone including my parents is too easy on me. I wish someone else expected so much of me. I would probably then actually do something instead of lounging around

I have no experience in anything. I have all these dreams of being a super famous comedy writer who directs movies and makes music and acts in things. I idolise all these people like Tim and Eric, Rik and Ade, Mitchell and Webb, Fry and Laurie. They met their comedic soulmate. I love writing. I wish I could have someone to write with. But there's no real options from school. I seethe over the idea of that. That's all I want in life. I've never completed a screenplay or a short story. I've just been daydreaming forever. About all the great scenes I'll put in my own show, all the great songs I'll use. What my album covers would look like. For the past four years though, I've done nothing. Especially not with the internet being right there. I spent all my time on my phone which helped with the loneliness. Your phone ends up filling the hole for some reason. It's like it stops your brain from getting sad. For the better part of my life I've been addicted to watching TikToks, then moved over to YouTube videos, now I'm using music as a crutch. To avoid reality. Like a man child. Or a woman child I guess. I have taken steps to stop using social media and it's going well, but I worry I'm too late. I'm so scared I'm never going to reach my goals before I'm 20. I feel like I've wasted my youth away and it's all my fault.

I feel like I can't change or improve myself and be more social because it would conflict entirely with what people think of me. It would be complete whiplash. When I'm older I want to just move away to a new place but I'm so worried now I don't have any TIME to change before I go elsewhere and have to put a new persona into affect. I would have to make a good first impression on the new place. I'd need to lose weight NOW and fast or else I won't be prepared

I have this ideal version of myself in my head. Of a girl with so much confidence it'll blow your socks off. She has amazing, strong arms, firm thighs, a flat stomach. She wears whatever she wants because she looks great in everything. She's super well read. Even watches the news. She has great, creative ideas. She's hilarious and innovative and iconic. She's able to pick up people on her shoulders. She has the perfect bookish boyfriend who she loves dearly. She's perfectly fluent in Afrikaans and is super good friends with the locals. I wish I could have a best friend again. Preferably one who likes writing. Then we could make great stuff together and be there for each other. Wouldn't that be terrific. To be in one's OWN comedy duo? We come up with stupid ideas and laugh hysterically over them. We would drink mimosas together every Saturday.

As an aside, I sometimes have arguments with my mum. Ones I can never predict. We'll get along well for MONTHS and then something happens and the whole relationship comes crumbling down once again. I can't prevent these spontaneous bouts of extreme annoyance and I can never stop them once they start. She says something, I reply with something innocuous, then my mum (who is very sensitive) gets a bit upset, I get even more upset, and it bubbles over from there. It's never ever a big deal. Always just a big misunderstanding. I always feel so guilty about our arguments. And I know this is awful to assume but sometimes I wish she would be the one to apologise. I can't tell when it's my or her fault. It always seems like my fault because she's always feeling bad for herself afterwards. ""I'm sorry I'm so annoying"" ""sorry I'm so disgusting."" But then maybe I am always in the wrong. I wish there was a third party who could mediate and tell us whats wrong, besides my dad who always gets angrier than both me and my mom because we were arguing in the first place. I think I inherited my occasional scariness and swearing habit from him. After arguments I sometimes feel so bad that I cut myself as a means of punishment, since I know my mum will never hold me accountable. Now I'm covered in scars. Keep in mind this isn't frequent. Only really once every two months. The cuts were always surface level with a blunt leg razor like a bic so the scars are very light. And it's not like I'm a miserable person. At the same time I wish my mom made more of a big deal about it when she saw I self harmed. TV shows always make it seem like it's supposed to be this big moment with tears and understanding. But she just said ""don't do that, please! Don't hurt yourself"" and said nothing else. I only ever have my sad, soap opera moments alone.

There's plenty of stuff that makes me happy every day. Sitting in the sun, listening to music, eating peppermints, movies, tv shows, my lovely cats. Acting is a great escape for me since it's predictable, unlike conversation. You know exactly what to say, how to say it, even how they (the audience) will react to what you're saying. They even think I'm funny. I love my parents very much. They're basically my best friends. They understand me best. I talk exactly like them, make the same references as them, have the same humour as them. This obviously comes with it's own disadvantages like not being able to relate to people my own age yk. But also there's a great deal of people who have awful relationships with their parents.

1lanvjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1lanvjt/does_anyone_only_have_these_symptoms_and_nothing/,Does anyone ONLY have these symptoms and nothing else?,"I'd never heard of POTS until a few years ago, and found it interesting as some of the symptoms fit me extremely well, but not all.

Since I was about 7 or so, after I'd had a hot shower and then stood up while my mum combed my hair, about a third of the time I'd almost faint or actually faint.

Since about age 10, I've experienced palpitations (which I used to call ""fluttering"") and they were so uncomfortable and made me feel breathless. They'd last a few minutes and then go away. They happened both when upright and laying down.

At 19 I went to join the university gym, and during the medical check, I was sitting on the exercise bike with the heart / pulse monitor on, and they couldn't even start the test because my heart rate was 188 bpm. I felt no different to usual. The stafd asked if I was really nervous (no), had drunk a lot of coffee (I've never drunk it as I hate the taste), and even if I'd done any drugs (nope!) They aborted the test and sent me for an ECG.

So laying down, the ECG showed my heart rate as being just under 100 bpm, and I was diagnosed with mild Tachycardia. 

For as long as I can remember, sometimes in the shower I'll feel really weird. Like a mixture of pre-faint, nausea, intense thirst, and brain malfunction. I can feel my heart beating in my neck and chest, like a heavy thud in between very faint and quick beats. I always have to sit down on the shower floor several times with my head down and the shower door open a bit for cooler air. This doesn't happen very often. Maybe once every few months. The last time it happened, I had to sit down 8 times in 20 minutes. It was very annoying. Then when I got out of the shower and dried off, I lay down on the bed, breathing slowly and deeply, and that was a huge relief. I felt SO exhausted too.

This also happens (rarely) after I get up from bed and within 15 minutes, I feel the same shower weirdness, except I'm not in the shower, I'm not hot, I'm just trying to do my makeup. I keep feeling weird / faint / sick and have to lay on the bed about every 5 minutes. VERY annoying.

I'm 46, and ever since I got a pulse oximeter in 2020 (for covid fear purposes), I've become aware that my heart rate never goes below 85 unless I'm in bed and literally half asleep (aka, relaxed). When laying down and awake, it ranges from 85 to 100. Standing up, it ranges from 110 to 130, and after a few minutes it sometimes will go down to about 95 to 120. Sitting down is somewhere in the middle.

A few times I went to bed with it beside the bed so when I half woke up, I could try it. Each time, I was so sleepy I almost fell back to sleep in the time between putting it on and it registering a reading. Also each time, it showed a number in the mid 70s.

Also a few times after feeling weird in the shower, if I had the energy, I'd test and the reading was between 150 and 165 bpm.

I've had daily headaches for over a decade and weekly headaches for decades. I sleep a LOT as I'm always tired. I lay down a lot, as it's most comfortable for me. If I sit up, my legs ache. I even eat laying down at home (propped up on one arm). If I have to stand for more than 2 hours, my feet ACHE and it's debilitating. It's easier if I can walk quickly as I'm moving and not resting all my weight on my feet constantly.

I think this all sounds like POTS, except I'm not generally breathless, I can walk fast with no issues (I'm not fit though), and aside from the Tachycardia being a constant (unless half asleep), the symptoms are not regular or frequent (which I'm not complaining about, but does this preclude me from actually having this? Can people have it really mildly?)

I'm female, 5'7"" and weigh about 128lbs for reference.

Anyways here the story about how six people contributed to the brides bad experience at her own wedding. 

I’m the MOH. We’ve been friends for about maybe 16 years. We were extremely close and people even made comments on her post just saying how wonderful best friends we are. 

This is what I did for her wedding:

a) went with her dress shopping with the bridesmaids it took about six hours total. 

b) paid for her plane ticket to Sedona for her bachelorette party ($400). 

C) I bought five people bachelorette bags that had personalized things inside such as sweatshirts, sunglasses, little hangover kit. All the decorations. A lot of decorations off Etsy, which can be a little pricey at times. 

D) I paid for everything food wise for her at the bachelorette party, which was three days long. 

E) I threw her a bridal shower with homemade decorations off Etsy that were personalized. I paid for all the ingredients to make tea sandwiches for 30 people.

F)  I bought her a $80 gift for her bridal shower off her registry. 

G) I made her an embellished scrapbook by hand for her wedding day. I spent around $150 on the homemade present.

All in all with paying for my own dress, my own alterations, paying for my own hair and make up paying for my overnight cabin that I had to purchase as a requirement from her. I would say I spent definitely between $2500 to $3500 for this wedding for my best friend. 

A few days after her wedding, she invited me out for coffee to talk about the wedding and I met up with her. I thought she was going to give us some sort of bridal gift and talk about how well her wedding. Instead, she took me out to coffee to tell me how I was part of ruining her happiest day of our life. She called me “disrespectfuI”, I  humiliated her and she’s was “irate” with me the entire time.  She wrote down all the things I did wrong. This is that list:

A) I was not with her by her side 100% of the wedding. She let my boyfriend be my plus one and I was around him too much. Her expectation was that he would be alone 100% of the night.

B) because I wasn’t by her side I wasn’t able to walk her parents down to the shuttle and make sure that they got on safely. She she said “ by going to cocktail hour before my parents. I disrespected her. I humiliated her and she’s amazed at my behavior. She said I made an ass out of myself.”

C) she mentioned that although every time she asked for me, I was there immediately doing everything she said, she was upset that she even had to ask for me. 

D) in my speech I said she got proposed to at Mount Lassen instead of Mammoth Lakes. 

E) when the photographer asked for family photos I wasn’t near the family to take her dog away when she needed somebody to watch her dog. (German Shepherd). 

F) I didn’t stay the night before the wedding at the Airbnb that she paid for because she wasn’t staying in the Airbnb. I told her that I’m diagnosed as of three weeks ago with clinical depression so I’m kind of tired and I personally would feel more comfortable being at home night before. It would take me 35 minutes from my home to the venue.


G) the other bridesmaids, were taking shots in the bridal cottage and they didn’t clean up their mess. The bride and groom had to clean up the mess while some of the bridesmaid and myself were down at cocktail hour.

H) she said that I should’ve known that she didn’t want the girls to be drinking and I should’ve done more as a maid of honor to step in and tell the girls to not be doing that. She didn’t want to be “ the wet blanket”. She wanted me to be the bad person.

I) if I was with her 100% of the time, then she wouldn’t have forgotten her veil for the ceremony

That’s how I contributed to her negative experience at her wedding. She took me out for coffee to tell me that I was the perfect made of honor. I did everything right I went above and beyond, and I did all those things on her wedding day and partially ruined it.  

Personally, her wedding was amazing. She spent at least over 65K on this wedding. She’s not happy at all about it and it’s because of six people and I’m one of them. AITAH for not being there 100% of the time even when I had a +1? She did explicitly say I was her “handler” and we talked about being together 100% of the time, but I didn’t think that it was really supposed to be 100% of the time because I’m also a guest. I felt more like a personal assistant than somebody she was happy to have there.

Mind you I did everything she asked for except for be with her 100% of the time. She did also take some blame, saying that she should’ve been even more direct with us and more putting her foot down about not wanting certain things to happen. I personally didn’t enjoy any of this wedding process as the.MOH. It was really stressful the entire process.

1lanpjl,https://i.redd.it/qg31aqdapq6f1.jpeg,Help! Dog is fixated on spot on the wall.,"I posted my girl Kava here for the first time earlier this month. I had to create a new account a few days ago. 

Some back story. She is a rescue and came from a very bad situation and has had to move a lot in the last year. 

I rescued her in Hilo, HI from a homeless lady that was using her for breeding, abusing her, and starving her. 

When I initially got her she had severe anxiety and panic attacks, and I had to get her medication to help. She’s been doing amazing and has not had to take any medication since November. And even then, it was just for our flight to the mainland. 

We moved in with my brother initially after getting back to the mainland. 

And from November-May we were staying with him. 

In May we moved into a larger home with our family, brother included. Although it’s a new home, we have the same furniture and there is a lot of familiar scents. She also knows my parents well and has spent a TON of time with them prior to us all moving in together. And she’s been completely fine. No anxiety or panic attacks. She’s been the happiest little girl. 

THE ISSUE: yesterday she started fixating on this spot on our staircase wall. She stands there for hours, doesn’t come when called and is getting panic attacks from staring at it. I’m not sure if she is coping with something? 

She was panting heavily, drooling excessively, and shaking. I had to give her anxiety medicine last night, put her in her crate with the lights turned down, a warm blanket and soft music playing. She fell asleep and calmed down. When I took her out to potty before bed, she again stood there fixated at the wall. Eventually I had to carry her up to my room and she was ok. 

This morning she seemed fine, walked right past the spot. We are about 5 hours into our day and I just went down to grab coffee and there she was standing there again. We can’t get her attention or distract her from this will. Cheese doesn’t even work! And there’s nothing she loves more than cheese. 

I will be scheduling a vet appointment of course. But wondering if anyone has advice in the meantime? Could this be a neurological issue? PTSD? 

Any advice or thoughts are appreciated!

1lanlbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1lanlbv/le25_my_sm_recap_trenta_size/,LE25 - My SM Recap (Trenta Size),"This is just going to be a recap of the good, the bad, the ugly from my own personal experience. But I wanted to share it and answer questions partners may have if you don’t have a relationship with you SM that you’ll get any of this from them. 

Day 1: Travel/registration day. For myself this meant getting to the airport at 5a, multiple connections, land at 2p. There were a lot of “support” partners that were wearing green aprons and would help guide you to the bus routes to the many different hotels they had us in. The support partners were actually (imo) one of the best parts of the LE. They held all sorts of jobs, primarily in Seattle/remote and if you stopped to chat with any of them they would tell you some of the most interesting work/projects that they are apart of. I was disappointed by how many managers seemed to treat them like dismissible volunteers??  After transport and checking in to the hotel, there was more transport to take you to The Mandalay where most of the things would take place. From there I spent an hour in check in for registration, then we were directed to the next floor to collect your “swag bag”. The Swag: A grey LE25 backpack, a tan branded journal, a branded pen, a (admittedly cute) water bottle, a starbucks designed pack of playing cards, a le25 pin, a starbucks branded rechargeable hand fan, and your $75 gift card to cover your first nights meal in Vegas. Which I initially thought was very nice, until my DM booked us a team dinner that totaled over $100 a person 🧍🏻 that was before tip and I didn’t drink. This landed my day around 8 ish (but my local  time would have translated to 11pm).

Day 2: Travel to the Mandalay began at 6am with breakfast being served until 9am. 7am til 11a was free roaming planning. You had the options of: Plaza (which was where SMs could interact with multiple places like the Partner Networks, Ethics and Compliance, POS development, inventory app Project Rio development, the mastrena 3 etc), Mall pop ups (included a coffee gear store, an olipop sample stand, etc), and the global barista championships. Lunch was served from 11a-1p. Travel from the Mandalay to Thomas and Mack (the arena). Big downside to this all was that walking traffic was awful, a lot of congested rooms and too many people for what the space allowed. I witnessed at least 3 panic attacks in person that required emt response due to packed nature of so many areas. The barista championships were so incredibly moving to witness, but it was in an odd place that when I got there…there was very few people. In the interest of post length I won’t gush about how wonderful all the contestants, coaches, and teams from the multiple regions were. My favorite didn’t make the final four, but I was moved to tears multiple times just witnessing them do something they are so passionate about and they were all so sweet/bright/charming. The final 4 was announced at 2 pm, but transportation had been so slow moving those of us that stayed were still able to board the buses (I would rather uber than miss it if I had to). Opening session was due to be from 2:30-4:30. It didn’t start or finish on time. Most of the clips online I’m seeing of managers partying was during load in/load out arena waiting time. The opening session is where we get a lot of the lighter announcements. By 5:30 the “welcome party” started. The bands were The War and Treaty, Ella Langley and Janelle Monaé. I was exhausted, and I would say only maybe 10% of people stayed to watch the performances. I had no idea who was playing until the War and Treaty announced the line up halfway through their performance. Me and my SM bestie stayed, but neither of us really knew any of the music. We’re both just very frugal minded and thought it would be a waste if no one stayed to enjoy it. When I talked to the rest of my district the next day, a lot said they would have stayed if they knew who was performing?? My day ended around 9pm.

Day 3: Travel started at 5:45am, breakfast began at 6. I met up with about half of my district to be there first thing because the barista championships final started promptly at 7:30. I picked up a friend SM on the way who told me his literal whole district was skipping it and planned to get to the arena at 8:30 when it would ending. The stadium was still very full, I just thought it was wild that there would be about 10-20% of people treating it as optional. Nobuki won!!! And he deserved it so much!!!! And my district had missed most of it but I filled them in with a play by play and we all got really into it. If anyone missed it or is confused- Chico didn’t complete his signature drink because of time. Each final presentation was only allowed 8 minutes. I was able to see him and Charlie from Team China later that day and tried to show them more love. 💕 9a-11a was another general session. This is where we got some of the biggest announcements. ASMs for almost all stores by early 2026, ASMs for all of Canada by summer 2026, labor investments for most/all stores to be used creatively with DM collaboration, Coffeehouse host/green apron service, Banana protein cold foam, raspberry is coming back as an LTO, fresh(?) baked goods in stores including a raspberry croissant, the new POS system rolling out, I’m sure there’s more I’m forgetting. 11:30a-1p was travel/lunch back from the arena to the Mandalay. For the rest of the day there would be 3 different session that broke up the crowd for smaller things. Green Apron Service (diving into Making the Moment Right), All about our Coffee (a large free roaming room where you could learn and experience almost every form of coffee. You had the opportunity to talk to members of the farmer support centers, roasters, people that worked in the science of coffee varietals, collect beans from hacienda alsascia, do your daily coffee tasting, etc), and the small break out rooms of Leading a Coffeehouse (info about us now being referred to as Coffeehouse Leaders, so I think my job title might have changed? Unclear. But it was a lot about decision making logic/prioritizing and planning. Discussions about our own commitments.) 6p-7p was transportation to the final event, this took much longer than this. 7p-11p was food/ entertainment. The infamous Bruno Mars concert. For me personally, I have a disability and I can handle my 8-10 hours days fine. But Bruno Mars was set to start his performance at 9pm, and going on hour 16 I was hanging on by a thread. My whole district was down on the field having a very good time, while I hung back with the SM bestie mentioned earlier. We sat in a nice big open section of the bleachers and enjoyed our food. The performance would have been very nice, but I didn’t even think about there being a pyrotechnic type boom/explosion part of the show. 😀 this is partly on me for not considering. My SM bestie knew where my medication was and helped coach me through my panic attack. We checked on our military peer, who told us it didn’t have the same sound effect on the field at all. I lasted until about 10 pm when they began setting off more effects and we decided to leave the event early. 

Day 4: All travel. Me and a peer decided to leave via uber at 4:30a to avoid the long transportation delays that had been happening the whole time. The coffee beans got us stopped at TSA. I was able to land home at 8pm.

Don’t know where to slide it in there, but I also want to say we were instructed to be “business casual”. I worry about some of y’all’s stores if you couldn’t understand what that meant to show up appropriately to the event. Like even the Bruno Mars concert was still a company function that was on our agenda- we were representing the company and I was wildly disappointed to see how not only people showed up in personal presentation, but also in actions. The amount of people who didn’t throw away their trash, who didn’t thank the staff or treat them kindly, who were disrespectful to one another. Made my head hurt. I hope some of y’all have conversations with your DMs waiting on you. 

TLDR: travel both air and walking during the convention was a nightmare, I think I got a new job title, green apron service/coffeehouse host, labor investments, ASMs for every store, banana protein cold foam, raspberry coming back as an LTO, fresh(?) baked goods in stores, barista global championship, saw a mastrena 3, the new POS system looks good, Janelle Monaé and Bruno Mars were there. I met amazing partners and people, and I was disappointed by the behavior of many peers.  Feel free to ask me questions! ",17,1749839897.0,starbucksbaristas,3,0.9,False

 The room was so dark I couldn’t make out anything beyond the faint, silvery moonlight seeping between the crack in the thick curtains. The air was still and stale.  But I knew I wasn’t alone.  I was never alone here.  Straining forward, I peered into the darkness. The cool metal of the collar bit into my neck as I willed my heart to slow down, but the pounding against my ribs increased until pressure clamped down on my chest.  I can’t breathe.  I can’t breathe in this—  Something moved closer to the bed.  I didn’t see anything, but I felt the slight stirring of air. My heart lurched into my throat as every muscle in my body tensed. There. A shadow blotted out the thin strip of moonlight.  
  He was here.  Oh God, he was here and there was no way out of this. There was nothing I could do. This was my future, my fate.  My swollen stomach ached as I shifted, pressing my back against the headboard. The chain jerked suddenly, throwing me to the side. My hands flew out. I grabbed onto the bed, but it was no use. A scream erupted, quickly lost in the shadows of the room. Yanked forward, I was dragged across the bed, toward him. Toward the—  My eyes flew open as I jackknifed upward and over, nearly tumbling off the bed. I caught myself at the last moment, dragging in mouthfuls of air—fresh air that was slightly scented and reminded me of autumns in the north.  
 Immediately, I pushed the mess of curls out of my face and scanned the room, stopping at the window. The curtains were pulled back, just as I’d left them before I’d gone to sleep. Moonlight streamed in, flowing over the small couch and sitting area. The surroundings and the smell were familiar. Sweet relief pounded through my veins at the sight of them.  But I had to be sure that what I’d just experienced had been a nightmare and not my reality. That I wasn’t still held captive by the Prince, who was hell-bent on impregnating me to fulfill some unbelievable prophecy that would throw open all the doorways to the Otherworld.  
  
  Slowly, I placed my hand on my stomach.  
  
  Definitely not swollen.  
  
  Definitely not pregnant.  
  
  So that meant I was definitely not in that house with the Prince.  
  
  I lifted a shaky hand, dragging it through my hair. It was just a nightmare—a stupid nightmare. At some point I had to get used to them. I would eventually stop waking up in a panic.  
  
  I had to.  
  
  My stomach churned, gnawing at me as I took a deep, even breath. Hungry. I was hungry, but I could ignore the hunger, because ignoring the burning emptiness in my gut had worked so far.  
  
  Exhaling roughly, I dropped my hands to the bed and swallowed hard. I was wide awake now. Just like the night before . . . and the night before that.  
  
  Behind me, the bed shifted and then a deep, sleepy voice rasped out, “Ivy?”  
  
  Muscles in my back locked up. I didn’t look behind me as I wrestled my legs free from the blanket. Heat crept into my cheeks. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to wake you.”  
  
  “Don’t apologize.” The sleep cleared from his voice and the bed moved once more, and I knew without looking that Ren was sitting up. “Is everything okay?”  
  
  “Yeah.” I cleared my throat. He’d asked me that a million times. Is everything okay? And the second most popular question—are you okay? “Yes. I just . . . woke up.”  
  
  A moment passed. “I thought I heard you scream.”  
  
  Dammit.  
  
  The warmth creeping along my face intensified. “I . . . I don’t think that was me.”  
  
  He didn’t immediately respond. “Were you having a nightmare?”  
  
  I was sure he already knew the answer to that, which meant it should’ve been easy to admit. Plus, a nightmare was no big deal. Hell, Ren of all people would understand if I was experiencing a side order of PTSD to go along with the main dish of Things Were Kind of Screwed Up Right Now. Especially since he’d also spent some R&R time with the Prince and his merry band of psychotic fae.  
  
  But for some reason I couldn’t admit to him that I was having nightmares, that sometimes when I woke up I thought I was still in that house, chained to a bed.  
  
  Ren thought I was brave, and I was brave, but in moments like these, I . . . I didn’t feel very brave at all.  
  
  “I was just sleeping,” I whispered, letting out a shallow breath. “You should go back to sleep. You have stuff to do tomorrow.”  
  
  Ren was leaving what I was now calling Hotel Good Fae to see if he could help locate the super special Crystal. Originally, this Crystal belonged to the Good Fae—the Summer fae. The Order had taken it from them and then Val had stolen it from the Order, and now the Prince had it. Without the Crystal, we couldn’t lock the Prince back up in the Otherworld.  
  
  “Ivy. Sweetness.” Ren’s voice softened as he placed a hand on my arm. The contact shook me. “Talk to me.”  
  
  “I’m talking to you.” I pulled away, slipping off the bed. The minute my feet hit the floor, I started moving. The gnawing emptiness in my stomach grew. “I think I’m going to go work out.”  
  
  “At three in the morning?” He sounded incredulous, and I couldn’t blame him for that. Working out in the middle of the night did seem odd.  
  
  “Yeah. Feeling restless.” Laying back down next to Ren right now, when my stomach felt the way that it did and with my head where it was, wasn’t an option.  
  
  Faye’s words from the night she helped me escape the Prince took the opportune moment to cycle through my thoughts. And if you keep feeding you’re going to get addicted. You probably already are.  
  
  Ren knew about the feedings, about the fact that I might’ve killed someone, but he didn’t blame me. He even believed that I wouldn’t hurt him. That I wouldn’t cave to the part of me that had awakened while being held captive—the part of me that was fae and now knew how to feed and how it could make me feel.  
  
  And how easy it was.  
  
  Ren trusted in me, but I didn’t.  
  
  I couldn’t afford belief right now, because I would never, ever forgive myself if I hurt Ren like I knew I’d hurt others. My mouth dried up as my hands opened and closed uselessly.  
  
  “Ivy?”  
  
  Realizing I’d got lost in my head, I blinked rapidly and refocused. “Have you seen the gym they have in the basement? It’s motivating even me to get on a treadmill.”  
  
  Of course he’d seen the gym.  
  
  Ren didn’t have the body he had without getting all up, close and personal with the inside of a gym.  
  
  “Instead of going to the gym at three in the morning, why don’t you come back to bed?” he asked. “We can watch some shows. Pretty sure you’ve missed some episodes of The Walking Dead.”  
  
  I had missed a lot of episodes of my favorite zombie show, which sucked, because every time I saw Tink, he was seconds away from spoiling everything. The same with Supernatural.  
  
  A sweet, almost bitter wave of yearning sucker punched me in the stomach, temporarily overriding the shadows lingering in the back of my mind. I wanted to dive-bomb back into that bed, cuddle up with Ren, and fall asleep in his arms, listening to Rick Grimes turn back into the Rick-tator we all know and love. That would be the normal thing to do, and God knows I wanted normal so badly, for so long.  
  
  It was why I had enrolled in college even though I already had a career. Well, did have a career in the Order. Who knew now? But I longed to know what it was like to wake up and go to school or work without worrying about dying on the job or discovering that my coworkers had been killed. Normal meant going out to restaurants and the movies. Staying in and marathoning shows without worrying at the possible, impending end of the world. Normal meant that my best friend hadn’t ended up being a traitorous bitch and dying  
because of her actions and choices.  
  
  Normal was so underrated.  
  
  The bedside lamp flipped on without warning. Light flooded the room, reaching to where I stood. Some bizarre instinct roared to life. I didn’t know why, but I didn’t want to be seen right now. I backed away from the light, but the moment my gaze met those leaf-green eyes, I froze.  
  
  Ren Owens was . . . goodness, he was beautiful in a wild sort of way. He reminded me of autumns in northern Virginia, all golden and copper. His hair was a tumbling russet mess, falling over his forehead and begging to be brushed back. Thick, heavy lashes I was admittedly envious of framed his stunning eyes. His cheekbones were broad and they were matched by a hard, chiseled jaw. Ren’s nose was crooked, and somehow that added to the beauty of his face. He had a lush pair of lips that were usually tilted in a grin, and when he smiled, there were matching, deep dimples.  
  
  Those corners were straight now, forming a somber line, and there were definitely no dimples.  
  
  Before everything with the Prince happened, Ren had slept shirtless or nude and we hadn’t been able to keep our hands off each other. Seriously. Even when we were injured with our bodies aching, we couldn’t ignore the chemistry sparking between us. But since I came back—since we were reunited—he wore a shirt to bed, along with boxers or sleep pants.  
  
  All we’d done was kiss.  
  
  Three times to be exact, and they were chaste, sweet kisses that tasted of a deeper, restrained need.  
  
  I think the nightmares were why Ren was sleeping in clothes, because those nightmares started the first night and had occurred every night after that.  
  
  And those nightmares felt like premonitions. A warning of what was to come, and I couldn’t shake that feeling, not even when the sun rose and I was surrounded by people who hadn’t given up on me—who cared enough to go back into hell and drag me out.  
  
  I suppressed a shudder.  
  
  “Please.” He extended a hand toward me. My eyes tracked up the vibrant vines tattooed onto his arm that disappeared under the white shirt he wore. “Come back to me and stay with me.”  
  
  My breath caught around the expanding knot in my throat. I wanted to be there with him. Desperately. But I . . . I needed space and I needed . . . I don’t know what I needed. I just couldn’t be here.  
  
  “Maybe later,” I said, finally moving. I made my way to the small dresser where some of my clothes had been stashed away. Guilt crawled up my throat like bile. “If you’re still awake when I get back, we can watch something.”  
  
  “You didn’t come back last night.”  
  
  I pulled out a pair of leggings. “I wasn’t able to fall back asleep, so I didn’t want to bother you.”  
  
  “You know you’re never a bother to me. Ever.” There was a pause. “And I didn’t go back to sleep. I waited for you.” The kind of patience I didn’t have kept his voice level. “I can go with you to the gym. Just give me—”  
  
  Whipping around, I saw that he already had his legs off the bed. “No!”  
  
  Ren froze, his eyes widening slightly. “No?”  
  
  I clenched the pants in my hands. “I mean, I don’t want you to get up and feel like you have to keep me company. I’ve already woke you. You should go back to sleep.”  
  
  His shoulders rose on a deep breath. “It’s not a big deal. I can go with you.” He stood, lifting his arms above his head and stretching. “We can have a race on the treadmills.” He dropped his arms. “Whoever loses has to go to the kitchen and steal the box of beignets they have shipped in every morning.”  
  
  My heart was pounding as he took a step toward me and then another. The room wasn’t very large, so it took no time for him to be right in front of me.  
  
  “I just need to get changed. Or I could go like this? What do you think?” he teased with a small grin. “Might not be the most comfortable run.”  
  
  Blood buzzed in my ears as my gaze dropped to his mouth. My stomach dipped as Ren reached for one of my curls. He’d pull it straight and let go. It was a favorite pastime of his, and then, if things were normal, he’d lower his lips to mine. Anticipation swirled as a tight shiver curled its way down my spine. Pleasant warmth invaded my veins.  
  
  But did I want to kiss him? Or did I . . . did I want to feed from him?  
  
  The fact that I had to even ask myself was terrifying.  
  
  I took a step back and bumped into the dresser, rattling it.  
  
  Ren went still as a statue. Terse silence filled the space between us as I stared up at him with wide eyes. “I’m not going to hurt you, Ivy. You know that, right? You’re safe with me. Always.”  
  
  Oh God, did he think I was worried he’d hurt me? Of course he would. How could I blame him for thinking that when I was as jittery as a coffee fiend when he was around me?  
  
  My face burned as I looked away. “I know you wouldn’t hurt me. I’m sorry—”  
  
  “Stop apologizing, Ivy. Dammit. Just stop saying you’re sorry.”  
  
  I opened my mouth and closed it when I realized I was about to apologize again.  
  
  Ren stepped back, giving me space. “You have nothing to apologize for.”  
  
  Didn’t I, though? It sort of felt like there was a list as long as my arm to apologize for, starting with the fact that I hadn’t recognized the Prince masquerading as Ren right off the bat. And there was more—God, there was so much more, and when my head was running in a million different places, it was hard to remember that Ren wasn’t holding any of this against me.  
  
  But how could he not? How could he sleep like he did at night? I wanted to ask him how he was moving on from this, because he’d been captured too. He’d been fed on—fed on in the worst way, and there had been this female fae. Breena. She’d claimed that her and Ren . . . She claimed a lot of things, but I knew if any of it were true, Ren hadn’t been a willing participant.  
  
  Rage replaced the warmth. I wanted to gouge her eyes out again, and I planned to. Right before I killed her. Slowly. Painfully.  
  
  Ren was watching me in a way that made me feel like he saw right into my head, and if that was the case, then he probably wouldn’t like what he saw. His shoulders tensed and then he exhaled roughly. “Okay.”  
  
  Relief swept through me.  
  
  His gaze flickered over me, and I thought that he may have seen the way my stance loosened in response to him backing off. His jaw tightened. “I’ll be waiting up for you.”  
  
  I knew he would be.  
  
  And I knew that deep down he realized there was no point.  
  
  Chapter 2  
  
  My sneakers pounded off the treadmill, shaking the whole thing like a herd of cows were trampling on the contraption, but I ignored the sound. My hands balled into tight fists pumped at my sides. The curls that had escaped my twist now clung to the nape of my neck and temples. Sweat ran down my throat and pooled in areas I didn’t want to even acknowledge.  
  
  Running.  
  
  Ugh.  
  
  I hated running—hell, loathed all physical activity on most days, but being a member of the Order, destined at birth to hunt down the fae who were feeding off mankind, I kind of had to be in shape.  
  
  But I wasn’t on this treadmill at the moment because I was some kind of predestined protector of mankind. I was just running, because there was nothing else for me to do. I was stuck here, basically on house arrest at Hotel Good Fae. Since the Prince of the freaking Otherworld could sniff me out like some kind of bloodhound, it was too risky for me to be out roaming the narrow streets of New Orleans.  
  
  My nails dug into my palms.  
  
  Faye, who had been working undercover at the Prince’s mansion, had explained that the glamour surrounding Hotel Good Fae would hide my presence from the Prince. That was the kind of power the fae who had descended from the Summer Court had.  
  
  A court that the Order had told us didn’t exist any longer.  
  
  My lips thinned as I picked up speed, literally going nowhere. The Order had lied about so much. They knew that there were good fae out there—fae who chose not to feed off humans, who lived normal lives, and aged and died like humans. The  
Order had worked alongside them at one time.  
  
  Had Daniel known?  
Being the leader of the New Orleans sect, Daniel Cuvillier had to know the true history of the Order and the fae. So that meant he’d also lied, and for some reason it stung like a bitch. Daniel was the closest thing I had to a father since I was shipped off to New Orleans. He was an ornery SOB and spent more time criticizing me than he did complimenting me, but he was . . . he was Daniel and I had trusted him.  
  
  All of us in the Order had trusted Daniel—we trusted the Order itself.  
  
  I didn’t even know why I was stressing about this, because at the end of the day, did it matter? I doubted I was still an Order member.  
  
  After being missing in action for the last month or so, and with the Elite—the super special and secretive group within the Order—scouting for the Halfling, I was sure they either thought I was dead or that I was the Halfling they’d been searching for.  
  
  That Ren had been sent here to find.  
  
  I swallowed past the sudden rise of nausea as I gave my head a little shake. Sweat flung out, dotting the control panel. The problem was that we needed the Order to open the doorways so we could send the Prince back. I had no idea how we would complete the act, the so-called blood and stone ritual. It had to be done in the Otherworld. How in the hell were we supposed to get the currently missing Crystal inside the Otherworld with the Prince’s blood, along with mine, on it? Just thinking about that made my brain hurt and I wasn’t about that kind of life right now. My brain simply didn’t have the space for any of that.  
  
  Last night, I found myself here after leaving Ren in the room. I was here again, a handful of hours later, because running usually made my brain shut down. When I ran like this, pushing my body until my calves burned, my thighs ached, and my heart raced, there was little room left to think and dwell on the weeks of my life I’d lost—the weeks I’d spent with the Prince.  
  
  I normally didn’t think about the horrid dress he made me wear or the way I’d been chained to a bed. When I ran until my muscles felt like rubber about to snap, I could ignore the insidious hunger gnawing in my gut—the kind of hunger that no amount of beignets or crawfish would succor.  
  
  When I ran to the point that my thighs felt like blocks of cement, I didn’t think about how the Prince had forced me to feed on innocent people. I didn’t hear the whimpers they made when my sneakers were thundering off the treadmill. I didn’t feel the euphoria that had come from feeding.  
  
  And when I ran until it felt like my chest was on fire, I didn’t have the space left to think about what that bitch Breena had done with Ren. Or what the Prince had done to me . . . had tried to do to me.  
  
  Keeping my thoughts locked down was top priority at the moment, but running wasn’t working for me now.  
  
  I needed to focus on something—anything.  
  
  My gaze flickered over the wall. There were several mounted TVs, but they were all turned off. I’d never actually seen a fae work out in here. I honestly didn’t know if they needed to work out.  
  
  Did that mean they couldn’t get things like heart disease?  
  
  Why was I even thinking—  
  
  The treadmill’s belt suddenly stopped under my feet, pitching me forward. I slammed my hands down on the rails, catching myself seconds from knocking my head off the control panel.  
  
  “Jesus,” I grunted, lifting my gaze.  
  
  Tink stood beside me, holding onto the emergency cord. “Good afternoon, Ivy-Divy. I’m happy to see your reflexes are still on point.”  
  
  Standing, I let go of the rails and turned to him as I dragged in deep breaths.  
  
  “But your observation skills suck ass,” he added, cradling the gray sling he wore over his shoulders with one hand. “I reached right in front of you and unplugged that thing.”  
  
  “You’re an asshole.” My chest rose and fell heavily.  
  
  He smiled proudly. “I am many things. An asshole is one of them.”  
  
  One of these days I was going to straight-up murder Tink. And I had a lot of reasons to act like it was time to Purge when it came to him. Starting off with the fact that up until recently, I thought Tink was about the size of a Ken doll. That’s how I’d found the damn brownie in the St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 , suffering from a broken leg and a tear in his fragile, gossamer wings. He’d been about a foot tall, if that.  
  
  I’d made him a leg brace out of popsicle sticks and nursed the little punk-ass back to life even though harboring any creature from the Otherworld would’ve gotten me killed. I still really don’t know why I’d saved him. I just felt so bad for him, but maybe the part of me that was fae had taken over, caring for another creature of the Otherworld. Who knows? And how did he thank me for it? Spent my money on bizarre, random shit he ordered off of Amazon Prime, hid from me that I was a halfling, and forgot to mention that he chose to be only twelve inches tall. That, in fact, Tink was very, very tall.  
  
  And totally anatomically correct.  
  
  Seeing Tink all man-sized never failed to wig me out, because I never thought of Tink in that way. Not only had he seen me in my undies a hundred times when he was miniature size, there was now a lot more of Tink, and. . . .  
  
  And adult size Tink was . . . hot.  
  
  Acknowledging that made me puke a little in my mouth, but it was true. When he was small, he had this cute, handsome little face and he was just Tink, and now that he was all big, that cute little face had broad cheekbones and his body was ripped and . . .  
  
  Yeah.  
  
  I screwed up my face. Seeing Tink like this still messed with my head, but I guess at the end of the day he was still Tink, and even though I wanted to bitch slap him into the Otherworld often, I sort of . . . I don’t know . . . loved him.  
  
  Not that I’d ever tell him that.  
  
  Tink’s hair was so blond it was almost white, and today he had it spiked. He was wearing jeans and a thermal. He must’ve grabbed one of the towels on the way in, because he held one in his free hand. I glanced at the bottom of the sling, where a little ball was curled up. He’d taken to carrying Dixon—his new pet kitten—around in a sling that I was pretty sure was designed for human babies—  
  
  Wait a second.  
  
  My eyes narrowed on the gray thermal Tink had on. “Are you wearing Ren’s shirt?”  
  
  “Yeah. I think it will endear me to him. Help us bond so we can be like brothers from a different mother.”  
  
  “Uh. Doubtful.” Ren was going to be pissed. “That’s also a little weird.”  
  
  “Why? Girls share clothing all the time.”  
  
  “Yeah, the key word is share, Tink. You just took his shirt.” I couldn’t believe I had to explain this. “Is that towel for me?”  
  
  “Yeah. You look like you’ve been swimming in a swamp.” He threw it at me. “But at least you don’t look like you popped an eyeball anymore.”  
  
  “Thanks,” I muttered, wiping the towel over my face. When I made my escape from the mansion, one of the Prince’s minions had tried to choke the ever-loving life out of me. I’d burst a blood vessel in my eye during the struggle. It was just as gross to think about as it was to look at.  
  
  Valor, the Prince’s minion, was a goner though. Ren had taken him out. That was one Ancient we didn’t need to worry about.  
  
  “I can’t believe you’re in the gym again,” Tink went on, stepping aside. “Why are you in here running so much? Are you preparing for the impending zombie apocalypse that I know nothing about? Because if you are, we need to find the nearest redneck to become best friends with, one that is hot in a dirty, rugged way. You know, the kind that probably smells like sweat and man, one with a complex background that makes you hate him at first, but slowly, over time, you grow to love him.”  
  
  I stared at him. “You’ve put a lot of thought into this.”  
  
  “I have. I like to be prepared. Since we’re in the south, it shouldn’t be hard to find one. So, why are you in the gym so much?” he asked, not missing a beat.  
  
  “What else do I have to do?” I draped the towel around my neck as I watched the little ball at the bottom of the sling start to move around.  
  
  �  
��I don’t know.” Tink patted the outside of the sling and got a tiny, muffled meow in return. “You could spend time with some of the peeps here. They’re pretty cool.”  
  
  “You think they’re cool because they worship you.”  
  
  His smile was so wide it could’ve cracked his face. “Well, yes, there’s that. They’re smart.”  
  
  Most of the fae here had never seen a brownie. The Prince and the Winter Court basically killed off Tink’s kind.  
  
  “You could also spend time with Merle or Brighton,” he added. “Momma Merle is almost always out in the courtyard, digging up something or planting something. She’s interesting. Weird. But weird can be entertaining, and Merle is entertaining. And I like Brighton.” He paused. “I don’t think she likes me. Actually, I’m pretty sure she’s kind of scared of me.”  
  
  I arched a brow. Tink sure did like to ramble.  
  
  “She sort of goes in the opposite direction of wherever I’m going.” His lips pursed. “Just this morning, I was in the common room. You know, the room you never hang out in, but anyway, I digress. The room has all these cool games and couches and shit. I was in there, winning a mean game of air hockey, and Brighton walked in, made eye contact with me, and then walked right back out. I don’t understand why. I’m super friendly and approachable. I also know that I’m damn good looking by human standards, too.”  
  
  I decided not to point out all the ways he probably freaked out Brighton, because that was a rabbit hole I did not want to fall down. Besides, I needed a shower stat, because I did feel like I’d been swimming in a swamp. I stepped off the treadmill, and the moment my feet hit the ground, my entire world wobbled. “Whoa.”  
  
  Tink grabbed my arm, steadying me. The dizziness vanished as quickly as it came on. “Are you drunk?” he asked.  
  
  I snorted, slipping free. “I wish. I didn’t eat breakfast or lunch yet. That was dumb of me.”  
  
  Tink was quiet as he studied me. “Do you think you might be overdoing it?”  
  
  “Overdoing what? Sitting around on an unasked-for extended vacation?”  
  
  “You haven’t been sitting around. You’re working out. Nonstop.”  
  
  “I’m not overdoing anything.” I walked away, edging around the stationary bikes and past the lazy-man treadmills—the ellipticals.  
  
  Tink was right behind me. “Not that you need reminding, but you were held captive for weeks and—”  
  
  “You’re right.” I whirled on him as the ever-present anger erupted inside me. “I don’t need reminding. I know where I’ve been.”  
  
  “But do you know where you’re going?” he asked softly.  
  
  I opened my mouth, but I had no idea how to answer that question. Where was I going? The anger slipped away, swallowed by confusion and a nearly overwhelming sense of helplessness.  
  
  God, I hated that feeling, because the last time I’d felt this way was when the fae had killed my boyfriend Shaun all those years ago. I’d been helpless then. I’d been helpless when the Prince put a collar around my neck and led me around on a chain.  
  
  I was still helpless, trapped in Hotel Good Fae.  
  
  Little Dixon popped his gray head out of the sling and looked around with sleepy kitten eyes. Tink reached down and scratched at his ear. “Ren should be back soon.”  
  
  My stomach dipped like I was on a roller coaster that was about to plummet down a steep hill. I hadn’t seen him since I left in the middle of the night.  
  
  “I saw him leave with Faye.”  
  
  A hot, suffocating feeling blanketed me, curling low in my stomach and mingling with every other crappy thing I was going through. The world tasted bitter in my throat, like I was suffering from indigestion.  
  
  I hadn’t known he’d left with Faye. Had he said something to me about it? I couldn’t recall. Not that it mattered. I mean, I didn’t suspect something or anything like that. Ren said he loved me, that he was in love with me, and I believed that. Totally. I just . . .  
  
  I wasn’t out there with him. Someone else was, and my head—my head wasn’t right.  
  
  “They were going out, trying to see if they could locate the Crystal thing.” Tink still scratched the little kitten’s ear and Dixon was purring like an engine. “You being stuck here while your man is out there, working to fix this has got to suck for you.”  
  
  I dragged my gaze to his. “Really? Are you trying to make me feel better?” I turned and started for the door. “Just so you know, it’s not working and you suck.”  
  
  “I’m not trying to make you feel better,” he replied, following me. “I’m just pointing out the obvious.”  
  
  “It’s not necessary to point out the obvious when it’s obvious, Tink.”  
  
  There was barely a half a second of silence. “You didn’t join us for dinner last night.”  
  
  Thinking this had to be the longest exercise room ever, I hurried up.  
  
  “You didn’t join us for dinner the night before or before that,” he went on. “And that means I’ve been eating with Ren. By myself. We just may kill each other.”  
  
  “You’ll be fine.” I reached the door, thank God.  
  
  “Where have you been?” he asked. “You’ve been here, but you haven’t been.”  
  
  “I’m here, Tink. I’ve just . . .” I didn’t know how to answer this because words failed me. How could I explain that every time I was around the fae they stared at me with distrustful, almost fearful, eyes? They knew what I was. They knew why the Prince had held me captive. They knew what I symbolized. “You know how I am with a whole lot of people. You guys eat in the cafeteria. I’m not into group activity—”  
  
  Tink grabbed my arm, stopping me from opening the door. He turned me around, and for once, his expression was a hundred percent serious. “Eating in a cafeteria isn’t a group activity.” His gaze flickered over me. “And it doesn’t look like you’ve been eating by yourself either.”  
  
  I laughed at that. “Trust me, I’ve been eating. A lot. Constant, actually.” And that was truth. I had to, because if I didn’t the hunger got to me. “I’ve just—”  
  
  “Been running ten miles a day, drinking tons of coffee, and not sleeping?”  
  
  My eyes widened. “Whoa. Are you stalking me?”  
  
  “I’m paying attention. So is Ren.” His gaze remained latched to mine. “Your face looks different.”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “Your cheeks are sunken in and you have these shadows under your eyes. They weren’t there before.”  
  
  “Wow. You’re starting to give me a complex.”  
  
  “Looks like you already have one.”  
  
  Uncomfortable, I pulled my arm free and whipped the towel off my neck, tossing it into the nearby laundry basket. “There’s no reason to pay attention to me. Okay?  
  
  Before he could stop me, I opened the door and stepped into the hall. I was so not in the mood for this conversation. Just like I wasn’t in the mood when Ren brought it up, which felt like every five seconds.  
  
  Ren wanted to talk about things—things that I didn’t want to think about around anyone, but especially around him.  
  
  I hurried down the hall, knowing Tink was still right behind me. Picking up my pace, I reached the end and turned, immediately stopping short.

1langh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1langh7/how_should_i_address_a_friend_that_keeps_creating/,How should I address a friend that keeps creating drama,"I am part of a friend group with Anne and Belle. We are all in our 30s. We all grew up in a rough neighborhood and rough families, but made it out pretty okay. Anne is one of those friends that ""tells it like it is"" with ""blunt honesty"" and we should know she's ""just like that!"". Belle is soft spoken, gentle, and very sweet. We all went through going from the same elementary school to now being adults with jobs.

While growing up, Anne tended to pick on people. She picked on Belle for her weight and me for competitive things like grades and boys. I admit, I would fight back and be just as petty. We fought over boys and grades. Belle just took it. After college, I thought it was silly to fight so I deflected her comments.

Now being adults, we have gone different ways in life. I am in tech, Anne is a nurse, and Belle is an art sculptor. Belle and I are married and homeowners (because of the second income from our marriages). Anne is not and I think this upsets her, as she used to be farther ahead of us in school in terms of popularity, grades, and college. I think she feels behind that she has not met these milestones. 

We still meet up occasionally and give life updates. Belle just closed on her home and I think this upset Anne, who started bringing up embarrassing stories about Belle. I told her to knock it off and we should be happy for Belle. Anne said, ""Yeah, I am happy for Belle now that she has enough space because...ya'know."" She transitioned into mentioning that she got a pay bump and we both congratulated her. 

  
Later, Anne asked me for help with ""tax stuff"" because I understand some finance concepts and revealed her income. I think she was using this as an opportunity to brag, because I didn't know any of the tax exemptions she was asking about. She then asked for my income. I am one of those people that makes stupid money in tech, like, I should not be making this amount, but that's just how the industry is. I thought about lying, but I felt like she would snoop around for confirmation and it would be more work to keep up a lie than to tell her. After I told her, she realized that I made more than she did and was radio silent for a week. 

Ever since then, she has been picking on nearly everything I am saying. Choosing to eat a yogurt parfait instead of a bagel? I'm calling her undisciplined in her diet! Suggesting a curtain color to Belle? What, does she not have good taste? Why did I try this coffee spot without inviting her?

I know this sounds like such a humblebrag but it's not. I bring it up because I think this is why Anne has picked me to be her target lately. I don't think I am better than Anne. Anne is doing really well for herself. I just wish she would stop being so mean all the time. 

If I am being honest, I am friends with her out of pity. Everyone else knows she is mean and avoids her. Belle and I are her only friends. But even Belle says she doesn't enjoy hanging out with Anne and invites her to every outing out of pity. My husband says that having friends out of pity is fucked up and I'm a fake friend for keeping her around. But at the same time, Anne is genuinely a great person and fun to be around, when she isn't being snippy. She has just been being more and more snippy lately. I've tried having a heart to heart, but she is always closed off and changes the subject. 

What do I do about Anne, if she doesn't want to have a serious talk, but she's not letting up on being snippy around me? She comes to me like I am hurting her feelings and she's trying to be happy for me, but it feels like it's coming from a place of malice when she drops in snarky comments or shares my embarrassing stories with strangers.",2,1749839567.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Stayed in oversized balcony with 6 people (44, 42, 21, 21, 17, 16) and it was more than enough space. No complaints at all. One bathroom was no issue for us. 

Food was great! We did lunch at Solarium as soon as we got on board (great food and way less chaotic than Windjammer). Most days we did breakfast at Windjammer early (like 7:30) and it was smooth and good. Two days we did the free continental room service breakfast to save time. Lunch on the ship we liked El Loco Fresh, easy and so good! We’d usually head into Windjammer mid-afternoon for snacks. 

We used the MDR for dinner and loved every minute of it. We did the themes and had so much fun. The food was great and our staff was amazing. We have zero complaints about MDR or the food. They’d let the kids try something and if they didn’t like it they’d switch it out. Gave me double orders to start for shrimp and lobster meals. 

Three drinking adults did the drink package and it was worth it. Three non-drinking did the refreshment package and it was worth it for us. Many virgin fun drinks for them and specialty coffees anytime…frozen drinks all day, to order, whole around the pool…can’t beat it. 

Shows were all good. We loved Hiro and Flight the most, but Hairspray and 1977 were very good too. 

No issues with elevator waits, no issues with pushing for add-on’s. 

Perfect Day we had a cabana at south beach and that was perfect for us. Beautiful spot, private swimming area, couches and chairs, umbrella, amazing food delivered to the cabana by our attendant when we asked. She even brought lots of goodies we didn’t have to ask for. 

Atlantis was fun…been there before and we love the water park. It was a little chaotic getting from ship to park, but that’s our only complaint from the whole trip.

1land92,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1land92/red_pill_roommate_experience_never_again/,Red Pill Roommate Experience – Never Again,"About a year ago, my barber asked if he could move into the finished basement in my home. I’m a single mom, and at the time, I was helping my grandmother with her property taxes, so I agreed—it seemed like a mutually beneficial situation. He moved in June 2024, and for the first few months, things were fine. He worked full-time, cooked his meals, and mostly kept to himself.

But after that honeymoon period, things slowly started to change.

⸻

His Vibe Was Always Off

From the start, his energy was off when friends or family came by. He wouldn’t greet them—barely a head nod or a look. One of my cousins parked in the driveway once, and when he came home, he called me instead of just knocking to ask who it was. My cousin apologized and moved her car, but she told me he was extremely rude and cold to her face. It became a pattern—not just with my people, but neighbors too. He’d avoid speaking, like basic human decency was too much effort.

⸻

Birthday Party Help That Was Never Real

In August, he offered to help with my daughter’s birthday party but then flaked the moment I actually needed him. He hadn’t seen his own daughter since he moved in and blamed her mother for “keeping her away,” which honestly felt like a cop-out to me. I’ve heard that excuse too many times before.

⸻

Household Habits & Weaponized Incompetence

When it came to household cleaning, he barely did the basics. Cooked all the time but never wiped the stove. Left oatmeal splattered. Wouldn’t flush after #2. Left the tub dirty, knowing my daughter takes nightly baths. I had to constantly clean behind him like I was his maid.

He had two Dobermans—poorly cared for. Rarely bathed, no flea meds, and he only fed them once a day. One dog constantly attacked the other. Animal control was called twice. Then one broke through the fence and got into a neighbor’s yard, which almost ended in disaster. I told him to talk to the neighbor—he never did. She ended up going through property management to get the fence fixed.

⸻

Money & Entitlement

He agreed to cover PG&E and water. Later, when PG&E hit $369 in winter, he started complaining and blaming my Christmas lights. (Mind you, I don’t even leave them on all night!) I ended up taking over the PG&E myself just to stop the complaining. I only asked him to pay $300 rent, which is dirt cheap in the Bay Area, especially for two private rooms, a garage, and a storage area.

But even that became a back-and-forth. Suddenly he “didn’t remember” me telling him the amount, though I absolutely did. He cooked more than I did but never replaced shared kitchen items like olive oil or pepper. Used up my household stuff and didn’t replenish anything. I started separating everything just to avoid the frustration.

⸻

His Girlfriend & The Disrespect

He had a girlfriend who was over constantly. First night he moved in, she stayed too. She barely acknowledged me. Came over 3–4 nights a week, and I always wondered—where’s your kid while you’re playing house in another woman’s basement?

She once waved me off when I said hello. When I brought it up to him, he brushed it off as “female stuff.” Real red flag energy. The man had zero accountability and always deflected issues with “well what about…” like a child.

⸻

Mother’s Day Disrespect Was My Final Straw

On Mother’s Day, I had just gotten back home after retrieving my lost phone. I made breakfast for me and my daughter. His girlfriend passed me on the way out and at least greeted me. He came upstairs, made coffee, then stood behind me for 20 minutes while I cooked, didn’t say a word—not even “Happy Mother’s Day.”

When I called him out via text, his excuse was “I forgot” and “I got a lot going on.” But in the same message, he said he had to move. Sir, I gave you a 3-month notice. He waited till the very last minute (72 hours before June 1) to actually start moving his big items.

⸻

The Red Pill Energy Was Real

He was very much a red pill dude. Constantly said misogynistic stuff. Once, while talking about childhood, he told me he was teased in school for not having Jordans and saw his mom give money to men. That’s when I realized he had deep unresolved maternal issues—just like some of my own brothers.

He disrespected the woman who owns the barbershop he works at because she wouldn’t let him treat it like his own. Even referred to her using the r-word, which was extremely triggering for me as a mother to a daughter on the autism spectrum.

⸻

Peace Since He Left

He finally left on June 1. Since then, the peace in my home has been unmatched. I don’t wake up dreading interactions. I don’t have to clean up after a grown man. I don’t feel annoyed every time I hear someone walking upstairs.

To be clear: I never felt unsafe. But I did feel like I was living with someone emotionally immature, entitled, and disrespectful. And in a weird way, it felt like I had a boyfriend I never signed up for—he expected all the domestic stuff without any of the commitment.

⸻

Ladies, Be Careful.

If you’re a woman—especially a single mom—please think twice before letting a man move into your home. Even if it’s someone you know. Men like this often don’t want to live alone because they can’t afford it and expect women to pick up the slack emotionally, financially, and domestically. This man was 45 and didn’t want the responsibility of owning a shop or living independently. That told me everything I needed to know.

There were other options. Harris, and I believe you could write in Mickey Mouse if you wanted to. Or like Pryor, None of the Above. 

The modern republican party seems to get off on cruelty. I mean you have Jesus thanking the Egyptians for welcoming him when he was in undocumented immigrant and you have republicans looking to deport anyone that resembles Jesus in an way. You have Jesus telling the Romans to give Caesar what is Caesar's, and you have republicans giving the 1% the money the 99% had. You have Jesus stopping executions saying let he who is without sin cast the first stone, and you have republicans tripping over each other to throw the first stone. You DON'T have Jesus ever once mentioning being Trans, and you have republicans passing law to ban Trans people because Jesus told them they're immoral. You also don't have Jesus ever saying a thin about abortion, and you have republicans gleefully denying women emergency care when only one life can be saved, and letting them both die because Jesus told them it'd be murder otherwise. You have Jesus telling people to care for the sick, and republicans cheer about throwing millions off of health care. You have Jesus telling people to shelter the homeless and republicans happily cutting all funding to help homeless seniors, the most vulnerable aside from children, from access to shelter. You have Jesus telling people to feed the hungry, and then you have republicans cutting free school lunches, SNAP, and other programs for the hungry. You have Jesus telling us to love our neighbors as ourselves, and you have republicans saying Jesus meant if they are White heterosexual male Christians. 

I'm not particularly religious any more, I have a problem with the main religions all saying they re the one true religion and everyone else is going to hell, that's a hard one for me to accept, my version of God is a loving god that is pure love and doesn't judge, but if He or She did, it wouldn't be by which subscription you had, so at this point I am Deist. To me God would be like in Bruce Almighty. Or even in [An Interview With God](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5779372/), I highly recommend that movie if you haven't seen it. It doesn't have a high score, but it was really good. A book called: ""[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance)"" is another good one. But I have studied many religions, and am well-versed in the Bible. I know what Jesus said because I paid attention. I also did the RCIA at one point, lol. But it saddens me that Republicans didn't pay attention. 

Jesus is the kind of guy you'd find at the local coffee shop taking time out of his day to play hacky-sack. He'd hang out with the Goths, he'd hang out with the Skaters, he'd hang out with the Punks, and the artists, computer guys, and even the Wall Street crowd. He'd be ""that guy"" that everyone knows, that gets invited to all of the parties, and actually shows up if he says he will. He wouldn't be preachy, but he'd always have advice if you asked for it. He'd also always volunteer his time to help you with projects. He'd probably even be willing to hang out with Republicans, but I bet even they would piss him off and he'd have to walk away. lol. The Bible tells us he DID get angry at people at times. He was patient, but even Jesus had limits. We used to joke that you should never piss off a stoner, because if they get mad-enough to get up, you'd better run. It'd be sort of like that. You know, tables getting flipped over and such. 

But, seriously, I want to know how any Christian conservative whether they're Catholic, Evangelical, Protestant, etc can support him. One study said that people that go to church regularly are MORE likely to support him. I don't see how that's possible. Are the priests in those churches preaching intolerance and hate?

1lanaau,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaptrail/comments/1lanaau/first_solo_bike_tour_trip_report_gap_in_late/,First Solo Bike Tour Trip Report (GAP in Late October),"I did my first multi-day bike trip (solo) on the GAP in October. Though I don’t usually post, I received such helpful advice on this forum that I wanted to give back with a brief report — especially for those less experienced like I was.

**Day 1: Pittsburgh to West Newton (\~35 miles)**

I landed at Pittsburgh International in the mid-morning and took a short Uber to Golden Triangle Bikes, where I’d reserved a hybrid. The staff was fantastic — responsive over email and phone, and the bike was ready when I arrived. The shop is just a few minutes from the official GAP trailhead, so I was on my way quickly.

The ride to West Newton was smooth, with surprisingly lovely stretches just outside Pittsburgh. That said, some of the small towns and mill sites between Pittsburgh and West Newton are for me the least scenic parts of the route. I stayed at Bright Morning B&B — well-run, good bike storage, and a big breakfast.

**Day 2: West Newton to Rockwood (\~70 miles total)**

I hit the trail at 8am. It was cold for the first few hours — gloves and layers are a must in October. But by noon, the weather had turned sunny and warm, and the trail was in peak autumn beauty mode.

First stop: Ohiopyle (\~42 miles in), which was the liveliest town on the trail. I had a great lunch at Ohiopyle Coffee Company. Then it was another 28 scenic miles to Rockwood, where I arrived just before dark. (Worth noting: it gets dark early in October, and dinner options are limited.) I stayed at The Gingerbread House B&B, a quiet, welcoming spot with a friendly manager.

**Day 3: Rockwood to Cumberland (\~44 miles)**

A slower morning and an easier day of riding. The landscape continued to impress — bridges, tunnels, long views. The final stretch into Cumberland is a rewarding downhill coast. I returned my bike at Wheelz Up, which easy and close to the train head. The Golden Triangle hybrid held up perfectly for the whole trip — no issues.

I took a shuttle that evening from Cumberland to DC. This part can be a bit annoying if you haven’t pre-arranged transport (I hadn’t, since I wanted to stay flexible). But along the trail itself, everything was extremely well-supported and accessible.

1lan7tg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lan7tg,Bombay original Dry Gin ft: My Snake,"Hello everyone, hope I continue to garner your respect with my critical and passionate reviews. I drink neat and dry and have been developing a strong palate for gins.

Today my snake (Ham Sarris, named after Sam Harris), will join us. 

Bombay original is the forgotten brother of Bombay Saphire. Because of this neglect I decided to pick it up and give it a try. This gin was about 2-3$ cheaper than Saphire and that is due to it having 2 less botanicals than Saphire: Cubeb pepper and grains of paradise. 

Bombay original smells… simple. It has an intense amount of heat with pungent juniper (a good thing in a dry gin). The smell is then followed by subtle earthy notes with little citrus.

Taste: a harsh burn that is kinda oppressive introduces the juniper which is rich and lovely. For those that don’t know, Italian juniper is the best juniper in the world and is what Bombay uses(gold star)! Faint citrus and even fainter sweetness follows. However, this is actually an enjoyable taste despite the burn. 

If you want a clean gin that is simple, no bs additives or gross ingredients, and is versatile, this is the gin for you. Saphire is obviously more complex and my preference, but this gin isn’t bad by any means. The burn, though harsh, might make you feel more traditional haha. Think of that gross cowboy coffee, you know it’s not good, but you also kind of want it… right??? This gin is probably not meant to be sipped neat but that’s how I drink and that’s how I critique.

Overall: 3.2/5 stars. The harsh burn holds it back but the website and distillery have amazing transparency and the bottle discloses all the ingredients! If you want to save a few dollars on Saphire, this is not a bad pick up! ",5,1749838984.0,Gin,2,0.78,False

I’m working on my first attempt at an absurdist/dark comedy story and would really appreciate feedback from fellow writers.

Below are the first two chapters. I’m hoping to get people's thoughts on how the story flows, whether the voice/character lands, and if you’d want to keep reading. 

Any feedback is more than welcome! Thanks so much for giving it a shot.

# Chapter 1

*Imagine this.*

*One second, you’re walking with your best friend, chili dog in hand. The next, you’re staring down death, and thinking, I’m gonna die with a mediocre chili dog in my hand?*

Scott’s eyes snap open.

Light floods in. His breath catches. Five feet in front of him, metal is crumpled, glass spider-webbed, hissing sounds coming from under the tires of the car.

His chili dog slaps against his shirt in slow motion, cheese, meat, bun, all sliding off him like shame as it flops onto the pavement, landing with a sound that somehow feels personal.

He doesn’t even notice.

Across the street, Aaron gapes at him, frozen, a chili dog in one trembling hand, chili sauce around his mouth like a kid who went mouth first into his birthday cake.

“Dude…” Aaron says, his voice hollow.

Scott blinks. Then, gravity catches up all at once, he stumbles backward, heels hitting the curb. He collapses, landing hard on his ass. He can taste bile in his mouth; it tastes like processed meat, with just a hint of regret.

“I almost fucking *died*,” Scott breathes. He wipes his shirt on reflex, spreading the chili into the fabric, turning his shirt into a child's finger painting.

Aaron jogs over, still stunned. “Why were you so far behind me?”

“I thought I saw a… silver dollar,” Scott mutters, slowing down on the last words. “I bent down to grab it. I thought you heard me say ‘wait up.’”

Aaron blinks. “A *silver dollar*?”

Scott shrugs. “It was just a bottle cap.”

Behind them, a self-driving car rests at an awkward angle, embedded in a pile of delivery drones. Some crushed, some blinking angrily. One drone lets out a mournful *boop*, as it powers down. Its final battle cry.

“Where did all those drones come from?” Scott asks no one in particular.

Sirens wail in the distance.

After a few minutes of collecting his thoughts, Scott’s eyes go wide. He stands up slowly, a newfound energy bubbling beneath the surface.

“Aaron…” he says, looking skyward, hands raised. “I think… I think God finally picked me.”

Aaron looks at him, still half-shook. Mouth still covered in chili.

“Picked me for what, I don’t know yet,” Scott quickly says, voice swelling. “But I’m alive for a reason. I can feel it!” He proclaims, full of his newfound sense of purpose. A guy in a ‘Jesus is My Gym Spotter’ tank top turns his phone camera towards the now chili-covered man with his hands in the air, like he’s waiting for rapture.

Across town, in a run-down apartment filled with pizza boxes, socks without partners, and the low hum of a refrigerator struggling, a man watches the birth of this so-called “Chosen one”. The 15-inch TV is mounted proudly on the wall, the ultimate crown jewel of the delusional home theater starter pack. The live news feed shows Scott standing in front of the wreckage, arms outstretched like a low-budget messiah.



The man scoops chips from a plastic bowl sitting on his lap, licking his fingers as he watches.

He’s lean but not fit. Handsome in a way that makes you distrust him. Dark features. Wearing heart boxers, an almost yellow stained tank top, and one sock with a hole so big his toe pokes out, like it’s trying to escape.

On screen, Scott says, “Thank you, God! I hear you loud and clear. I won’t waste this chance!”

The man takes a sip from a can labeled: “Despair (Diet)”.

“You poor dumb bastard,” he chuckles, with a smirk on his lips.

“I wonder what else is on.”

He reaches for the remote, but it melts in his hand. He sighs and lets it drip onto the dirty stained shag carpet.



# Chapter 2

After an eventful morning of almost being flattened by his own version of Christine, Scott and Aaron still managed to make it to work on time. Scott, still in the same clothes, is walking around like a microwaved chili dog dressed for casual Friday. He enters the lunch room looking for a little four o'clock pick-me-up.

He picks up a banana from the fruit bowl in the middle of the breakroom table and begins peeling it like he’s unwrapping his fate.

Slowly, deliberately.

*God saved me for a reason. I’m chosen for something. But what?*

He takes a bite of the banana, and chews slowly.

*He must have been wanting to show me that I’m meant for more, that’s why he made me think it was a silver dollar on the floor.*

He leans his back against the sink, which is filled with everyone’s dirty coffee mugs from the morning.

He mindlessly takes another bite.

*Maybe he wants me to buy that piece of land that I was eyeing, the message is to leave the big city, it’s dangerous? Or what if…*

*uh oh*

*Bananas.*

*Why did it have to be bananas?*

*I would’ve preferred dying with a chili dog in my hand!*

He drops his remaining banana on the floor as he struggles to swallow the chunk lodged in his throat. He’d nearly died this morning thanks to a rogue AI, and now fruit was joining in on the conspiracy.

He paces as panic begins to rise in his chest. He tries to breathe, tries to swallow, anything, but his arms flail uselessly, his panic levels hit critical mass. He realizes he’s running out of time, he quickly walks out of the lunch room to Aaron's office and bursts in.

“What’s up, man?” Aaron says not even glancing up from his computer, not noticing that Scott is starting to look like Violet Beauregarde at the end of her chocolate factory tour. Scott begins waving his hands, grabbing at his throat. Aaron still doesn’t notice, it’s almost like he’s in a trance on whatever work is on his screen.

Just as Scott feels the last bit of oxygen leaving his brain, the door swings open, slamming into his back, forcing the banana to fly out of his throat onto Aaron's lap. “Dude, what the fuck??” Aaron exclaims as he gets up and stares down at the goop on his lap. He looks up at Scott, who’s now gasping for his newly found air.

“Oh thank God!” Scott cries as he clumsily walks up to a chair in front of Aaron's desk.

The mailman walks in with a cart full of boxes and envelopes. He drops a small box on Aaron's desk, and leaves without a word.

“Aaron,” Scott wheezes through raspy breaths, “I think the fruit’s trying to finish what the car started.” He says as he looks up at his friend.

Aaron stares at Scott, confusion and concern written all over his face. “First of all, why did you just come and spit up baby food at me, and second of all, are you okay? You look like an Oompa Loompa!” Aaron says as he looks at the chewed-up banana still smeared on his lap.

“Violet,” Scott quickly responds.

“What?” Aaron looks more confused.

“Violet Beauregarde. Willy Wonka. The one who turns blue, not an Oompa Loompa, they’re orange.” He says, his voice still raspy, his breath coming back to him.

“Well, whatever you look like, it’s shit. What is going on with you?” Aaron exclaims as he grabs a tissue from his desk, wiping the goop off his lap.

“I was trying to get your attention, waving my arms like a madman, but you were too busy doing…whatever it is you were doing to notice your friend about to die from banana asphyxiation!” he says accusingly.

“I was…” Aaron stops and looks down at his computer. Scott notices a shift in Aaron's face as he looks at what’s on the screen. Scott quickly gets up and circles the desk to see what Aaron was working on. On the screen is a video of a crudely drawn animated badger doing squats to a techno beat. The title says: “BADGER BOOTY BLAST VOL. 3.”

Scott stares.

“You have GOT to be kidding me.”

“I swear to God, I was just taking a break, I’ve been looking at vendor invoices all morning! I don’t even like techno…” Aaron says quietly, his head down in shame.

“Next time someone barges into your office choking, maybe help, instead of watching your furry fetish.” He gestures at the screen.

“I was on a break!” Aaron exclaims. He pauses, a thought capturing him in the moment. “But, what’s weird is I remember you came in, but it’s like I was watching from outside of my own body…” he says, a bit perplexed.

“It’s fine, I’m here, I’m fine, let’s just move on,” Scott says. He looks at the package dropped off on the desk, “The mailman left in a hurry, but I’m sure glad he came in when he did. Or else you would be looking at your buddy's blue corpse on the ground.”

Aaron follows Scott's gaze to the package. “I don’t remember ordering anything,” he says, picking up the box as he starts to open it.

He wrestles with the paper inside: “Why do they shove so much crap into these tiny boxes! It almost feels like the paper is what I ordered!”

As he finally removes the last of the paper, he pauses, his brow furrows, he turns the box around to read the label.

“Oh, no wonder,” he says as he turns the box to show Scott. “It’s for you. The new mailman must have gotten our offices mixed up.” He hands the box to Scott.

Scott looks in the box and sees a silver dollar. The fluorescent lights above make the coin glisten.

“Oh…my…God,” Scott says, awestruck, staring at the silver dollar. “If I needed another sign that I was chosen, it’s this!” He holds it in his palm, like some holy object was given to him from the gods themselves.

“This is a 1903 Morgan Silver Dollar!” He exclaims.

“You say it like I should know what it is,” Aaron says, bored as he sits back down at his desk and closes the badger tab. “Stupid badger…” he says under his breath.

“This is the same year my great-great-grandfather…Ah screw it, it’s fate!” he says giddily as he begins to leave the office. “Anyway, thanks for almost watching me die again, let’s not make it a habit.” As he walks out of the room.

Meanwhile, across town, in the same run-down apartment, the man is still sitting in his recliner. This time, he has a bowl of what looks to be grapes, but on closer inspection,  they are blinking and pulsing gently. He begins to pop one by one into his mouth. On the TV, you see Scott back in his office, gingerly placing his new treasure in a small container. The man smiles, a glint in his eye. He sticks the blinking eyes on his fingertips and flexes them like tiny puppets.



He looks down at them and laughs, a low, guttural sound. The eyeballs blink in response. In the background, a flicker crosses the TV. The picture begins to turn grainy.

“It’s about damn time you finally noticed,” the man says with a chuckle, as he pops the eyes off his fingers and eats them.

Chewing with a wet squish after each bite.

The first time,"" chimed in Blake, another rich kid from Luigi's circle, ""we told her Luigi lost the Tiffany bracelet he was supposedly getting her. She spent the entire.........","Chapter 1 

When Ariana Collins rushed to the hospital after hearing that Luigi Maggiore had crashed his Maserati and was bleeding out, she immediately donated a full liter of blood for him. His friends urged her to go home and take a break, and she reluctantly agreed. But just as she reached the doorway, anxiety gripped her heart and pulled her back. Turning around, she witnessed a nurse dumping all five bags of blood—her blood—straight into the garbage bin! At that moment, thunderous laughter erupted from a nearby room, so loud it could've shattered windows. ""Jesus Christ, Ariana Collins fell for our bullshit again!"" a voice howled. ""What a fucking idiot!"" Ariana froze, staring through the half-open door. Among the crowd, she immediately spotted him. Luigi was lounging casually against the headboard, scrolling through his iPhone, barely paying attention to his friends. Though his face was partially blocked, she could still make out his chiseled jawline and perfect features— He didn't have a single scratch on him. Ariana blinked hard, convinced her distress was making her hallucinate. ""Fellas, let's count,"" drawled one guy she recognized as Tyler, Luigi's lacrosse teammate. ""How many times have we screwed with her now? The first time,"" chimed in Blake, another rich kid from Luigi's circle, ""we told her Luigi lost the Tiffany bracelet he was supposedly getting her. She spent the entire night searching in a blizzard. Even with a 104-degree fever, the dumb bitch wouldn't quit. Remember the second time?"" Derek, Luigi's roommate, leaned forward eagerly. ""We convinced her Luigi was in a coma. She spent all night at St. Patrick's Cathedral lighting candles and sobbing to some priest. Got holy water and a blessed rosary. Luigi gave the water to my dog and gifted the rosary to Leila Brown the next day! My personal favorite,"" smirked Josh, ""was when we framed her for plagiarism and nearly got her expelled. The way she begged the academic board—pathetic! Still makes me laugh thinking about it.""  
  
""This blood donation scam makes ninety-six,"" Tyler calculated, checking something on his phone. ""Just three more pranks, and our revenge tour wraps up. Not bad for four years of entertainment. Worth every minute, right, Luigi?""  
  
Luigi barely looked up from his phone, his voice detached and bored. ""Whatever. As long as I can finally ditch her after we hit ninety-nine.""  
  
""It's what she deserves,"" Blake insisted. ""Remember how she beat Leila for that dance scholarship? Leila cried for days. Nobody messes with your dream girl and gets away with it.""  
  
""That's why it's been so perfect,"" Derek added. ""Dating her just to systematically destroy her? Pure genius, man. Too bad it's almost over. We'll need to find someone else to torture soon.""  
  
A deafening ringing filled Ariana's ears, like a bomb had detonated inside her head.  
  
Her chest constricted so violently she thought she might be having a heart attack. She clutched at her sternum, doubling over to gasp for air, her lungs burning as though filled with acid.  
  
The words kept replaying in her mind like a nightmarish loop. Luigi was only dating her for revenge. Four years of what she thought was love—just an elaborate scheme to break her.  
  
He knew exactly how desperately she loved him...  
  
Luigi Maggiore, Boston's unofficial prince. Student body president with a 4.0 GPA headed to Harvard Law. Heir to the Maggiore real estate empire. With his Mediterranean good looks, he could've stepped off a Calvin Klein billboard. ""One look at Luigi Maggiore and you're ruined for all other men""—that's what everyone said.  
  
And like a moth to flame, she'd fallen just like all the rest.  
  
She had chased him relentlessly for three years, sacrificing every shred of her dignity, while he remained coldly indifferent—until one day, when he miraculously accepted her confession.  
  
She thought her persistence had finally melted his heart. Instead, it had all been a calculated game of destruction.  
  
The truth crushed her: he'd initially rejected her because his heart belonged to someone else.  
  
He only agreed to date her later because she had beaten Leila Brown in that crucial dance competition and made his precious dream girl cry.  
  
For revenge, he pretended to love her, orchestrating ninety-nine humiliations to systematically destroy her soul piece by piece.  
  
Ariana's tears streamed down uncontrollably, her throat constricting as if invisible hands were choking her.  
  
She stared at the group laughing without restraint, at Luigi's indifferent face, and suddenly felt hollowed out completely.  
  
She had given him everything—her love, her trust, her very being—only for him to crush it all beneath his Italian leather shoes and toss it away like yesterday's garbage.  
  
Just then, Josh noticed movement at the door and glanced over.  
  
Ariana spun around and fled.  
  
She walked faster and faster until she was sprinting down the hospital corridors, past startled nurses and visitors.  
  
She had no destination—she just needed to escape this place, escape Luigi, escape the smoking ruins of her reality.  
  
When her legs finally gave out in some distant corner of the hospital garden, she collapsed onto a bench as tears flooded from her eyes like a broken dam.  
  
She covered her face with trembling hands, her body convulsing with silent sobs that tore through her like physical pain. Each breath felt like inhaling shards of glass.  
  
God, Ariana, you pathetic, gullible fool.  
  
After what seemed like hours, her phone vibrated in her pocket.  
  
With shaking hands, she answered to hear her mother's gentle voice.  
  
""Ariana, sweetheart, your father and I are finalizing our arrangements to move to London next week. The Royal Academy of Music is eager for him to start the spring term. Are you absolutely certain you don't want to join us? They have excellent dance programs there too.""  
  
Her father, a celebrated violin professor at Juilliard, had received this prestigious appointment months ago. They had planned to relocate as a family, but Ariana had delayed and made excuses repeatedly, unable to bear leaving Luigi. She'd even considered staying in Boston permanently, transferring to a local college just to be near him.  
  
Now, the irony of it all cut deeper than any knife could.  
  
""No,"" she wiped away her tears with such force it hurt her skin. She took a deep, shuddering breath. Her voice emerged raw but unwavering, ""Mom, Dad, I'm coming with you to London.""  
  


Chapter 2

Her mother's excited voice immediately came through the phone: ""That's fantastic, sweetheart! We'll start the paperwork right away—once it's done, there's no turning back. It's a point of no return.""  
  
She gripped her phone tightly, fingertips trembling, but her voice remained unshakeable: ""I won't change my mind.""  
  
Her mother was about to hang up but hesitated, cautiously asking: ""What about that boyfriend of yours? Didn't you chase after him forever? I thought you were head over heels for him.""  
  
The word ""boyfriend"" felt like a knife twisting in her chest.  
  
Ariana's mind instantly flashed back to the hospital room—the cruel laughter, Luigi sprawled carelessly on the bed scrolling through social media, his friends' vicious mockery, and the devastating realization that he'd wasted three years dating her solely to execute some twisted revenge plan for Leila Brown.  
  
Her heart constricted so violently she could barely breathe, like someone had reached into her chest and was squeezing it with bare hands.  
  
""I'm done with him,"" she heard herself say, her voice raw but eerily steady. ""Completely done. Forever.""  
  
After hanging up, Ariana stood motionless on the sidewalk, letting the bitter wind whip through her hair. She stared up at the bleak gray sky, drew in a deep breath that burned her lungs, and turned toward what she had foolishly called ""home.""  
  
The moment she pushed open the door, the familiar scent punched her in the gut.  
  
Ariana froze in the entryway, staring at the living room she knew so well, feeling like she was trapped in someone else's nightmare.  
  
This was Luigi's apartment—the one he'd casually tossed her a key to after finally acknowledging her feelings.  
  
That day, he had leaned against the doorframe with that trademark smirk and shrugged: ""Wanna shack up?""  
  
Back then, she'd blushed like an idiot, heart soaring with joy, believing it was the beginning of their love story rather than what it actually was—convenient access for his ongoing psychological torture campaign.  
  
She had spent countless nights lying beside him, dreaming about their future wedding in this very living room, picturing their children running around, fantasizing about growing old together in this space.  
  
Now those memories were like acid in her veins.  
  
Moving in together? Just another calculated move to maximize her pain when the final blow came.  
  
She couldn't comprehend the depths of his obsession with Leila—to waste three years of his life with someone he despised, to live with her, to sleep with her night after night...  
  
All to build the perfect illusion before destroying her completely.  
  
For the next three days, Ariana didn't so much as text Luigi at the hospital.  
  
She locked herself in the apartment and systematically purged every trace of him from her life.  
  
She found the journal where she'd documented her pathetic crush—a thick, worn notebook with every page filled with lovestruck ramblings.  
  
""OMG saw Luigi in the library today!!! White button-down + those jeans = DYING. Had to pretend to read because I couldn't stop staring!""  
  
""HE ACTUALLY SPOKE TO ME TODAY!!! Just asked me to pass his coffee but I swear our fingers touched and there was a MOMENT. Haven't washed my hand yet lol.""  
  
""I CANNOT BELIEVE IT. He said YES. ME. Luigi Maggiore is dating ME. Is this real life?? I'm literally shaking writing this!!!""  
  
Ariana flipped through page after cringe-worthy page, tears streaming down her face, each drop burning like fire.  
  
She threw the journal into a garbage bag with such force it tore through the plastic, her hands shaking with anger—at him, but mostly at herself.  
  
Next came the gifts she'd spent thousands on—  
  
The sterling silver tie clip she'd saved three months for. The limited-edition watch she'd stood in line overnight to purchase. The designer jacket that cost more than her rent. Each item representing months of sacrifice and planning on her part, probably tossed in a drawer and forgotten on his.  
  
Finally, the dozens of photos she'd secretly taken and printed of him.  
  
Pictures of Luigi giving campaign speeches for student president, dominating the basketball court, holding court in hallways surrounded by admirers—each one had once made her heart flutter like a trapped bird.  
  
She dumped everything into the trash, methodically erasing every physical reminder of her former delusion.  
  
By the evening of the third day, Ariana had finally purged the last item.  
  
Standing in the center of the now-barren living room, she felt a strange lightness wash over her, like shedding a skin that had grown too tight.  
  
Just then, the front door swung open and Luigi walked in.  
  
His eyes narrowed as he surveyed the noticeably emptier space. ""What the hell did you throw out?"" His tone was sharp, demanding.  
  
Ariana looked up, meeting his gaze without flinching: ""Nothing important. Just garbage I should've gotten rid of years ago.""  
  
Luigi stepped closer, irritation evident in his voice: ""I was in the fucking hospital after a serious accident. Where were you?""  
  
Ariana's lips curved into a hollow smile, her voice ice-cold: ""You're walking around just fine, aren't you? Guess it wasn't that serious after all.""  
  
Luigi froze, clearly caught off guard by her tone. He recovered quickly, softening his approach: ""I heard you donated blood for me. I was worried about you, so I came to check.""  
  
His gaze dropped to her arm, his voice dropping to that seductive murmur she once found irresistible: ""Are you in pain?""  
  
Ariana pulled her arm away like his gaze might contaminate her. ""No,"" she said flatly, as if speaking to a stranger.  
  
Luigi's brow furrowed deeply, clearly unsettled by this new version of her: ""What the fuck happened while I was gone? You're like a completely different person.""  
  
Ariana's lips twitched into a smile that didn't reach her eyes: ""Different? How so?""  
  
Luigi didn't answer, but they both knew exactly what had changed.  
  
The old Ariana had looked at him like he hung the moon and stars. She'd once spent three straight nights by his bedside when he had a common cold, checking his temperature every hour, making homemade soup, practically worshipping at the altar of his minor discomfort.  
  
Yet now, after what was supposed to be a life-threatening accident, she hadn't even bothered to call.  
  
Luigi's intense gaze searched her face, hunting for some clue to this sudden transformation.  
  
His voice dropped to that practiced, intimate tone he used when he wanted something: ""You seem stressed. My boys are throwing me a welcome-back rager tonight. Come with me?""  
  


Chapter 3

Before Ariana could refuse, Luigi had already grabbed her wrist and practically dragged her to his Tesla.  
  
The car pulled up outside The Box, Manhattan's most exclusive members-only club. After parking, Luigi circled around to her side and opened the door with a theatrical flourish that once would have made her heart flutter.  
  
Ariana gave him a flat, empty stare as she stepped out.  
  
The moment they entered the dimly lit space, Ariana's attention was immediately drawn to a familiar figure.  
  
Leila Brown.  
  
She wore a champagne silk slip dress with a dangerously high slit, Louboutins, and just enough diamonds to look effortless. Her glossy hair fell in loose waves, and her calculated smile drew everyone in as she held court in the VIP section, cocktail in hand.  
  
Leila had been Luigi's childhood friend. Though they had grown up together, during the years Ariana had dated Luigi, the two women had never crossed paths.  
  
So she'd never suspected that Luigi had been obsessed with Leila all along.  
  
When Leila spotted them, her eyes flickered with recognition, then narrowed into the slightest smirk—a look that confirmed everything. She'd been in on the 99-part revenge scheme all along.  
  
This is revenge #97, Ariana realized with stomach-turning clarity. Coming here was a setup.  
  
Luigi also noticed Leila's presence. His fingers tensed around Ariana's before he abruptly dropped her hand like it had burned him.  
  
He leaned in, his breath hot against her ear: ""Gotta take this call. Network with people or whatever. Back in five.""  
  
Ariana stood frozen, watching Luigi's retreating figure, a cold emptiness spreading through her chest. The casualness of his dismissal felt like another slap in the face.  
  
Before she could react, Leila was already gliding across the room with runway precision, following directly in Luigi's wake.  
  
Their silhouettes—one leading, one following—disappeared around a corner, no doubt heading somewhere private.  
  
Ariana had no time to dwell on what they might be doing together, as Luigi's friends quickly surrounded her.  
  
""Well, if it isn't Luigi's favorite charity case!"" Tyler's voice boomed as he shoved a glass of something amber-colored into her hand.  
  
Ariana shook her head firmly. ""I don't drink.""  
  
""Don't be such a fucking buzzkill,"" Blake sneered. ""What's wrong, afraid Daddy Luigi will get mad?"" They all laughed, exchanging knowing glances.  
  
""Or maybe she can't handle her liquor,"" Derek added, pushing the glass toward her lips. ""Little Miss Perfect probably gets wasted off one shot.""  
  
Ariana tried to step back, but Josh blocked her path. ""Either drink it or wear it, sweetheart.""  
  
When she tried to break free, Tyler gave her a hard shove. ""Oops, my bad.""  
  
""Ah—!""  
  
She cried out as she lost her balance and fell straight into the adjacent infinity pool.  
  
The freezing water engulfed her instantly.  
  
She couldn't swim. Her limbs flailed desperately, but her clothes quickly became waterlogged, dragging her down.  
  
Water rushed into her nose and mouth, burning her lungs. The club lights above the surface blurred and distorted as her consciousness began to fade, darkness closing in until everything went black.  
  
...  
  
When Ariana next opened her eyes, she found herself back in the bedroom of Luigi's apartment. Her head pounded with each heartbeat, and her body burned as if she were being roasted alive.  
  
She struggled to focus her vision and saw Luigi sitting by the bed, holding a glass of water and some pills.  
  
""You're burning up. Take these,"" Luigi said, his voice soft with what might have seemed like concern—if she didn't know better now.  
  
Ariana hazily accepted the pills and swallowed them with the water.  
  
Too weak to think clearly, she only registered that her throat felt like she'd swallowed glass and her body seemed to have turned to concrete.  
  
She closed her eyes, wanting to escape back into unconsciousness, but her temperature kept climbing, something scorching through her veins.  
  
Some time later—minutes or hours, she couldn't tell—she forced her eyes open again and realized Luigi was gone.  
  
Of course, she thought bitterly. He can't even be bothered to maintain the charade anymore.  
  
She struggled to sit up, touching her forehead. It was terrifyingly hot.  
  
She knew she couldn't wait any longer. She needed medical help.  
  
With trembling fingers, she ordered an Uber to the nearest ER.  
  
Ariana dragged her leaden body through the hospital doors, barely making it to the reception desk before a nurse rushed to help her.  
  
The doctor immediately put her on an IV drip, which finally brought her fever down slightly.  
  
After examining her thoroughly, the doctor frowned: ""Ms. Collins, your temperature was 104.3 when you came in. You're bordering on pneumonia from aspiration. Why didn't you come in sooner?""  
  
Ariana leaned weakly against the hospital bed, her voice barely audible: ""I thought the medicine would help.""  
  
The doctor looked concerned. ""What medicine were you taking?""  
  
Ariana pulled a small bottle from her pocket and handed it to the doctor. ""Aspirin. My boyfriend gave it to me.""  
  
The doctor opened the bottle, examined its contents, and his expression darkened: ""These aren't aspirin at all. The bottle is labeled correctly, but these are nothing but sugar pills. Taking these instead of actual medication could have been extremely dangerous in your condition.""  
  
Ariana's heart plummeted, her fingers trembling slightly.  
  
Suddenly, her phone buzzed repeatedly.  
  
She weakly raised her hand to check it. A series of WhatsApp notifications lit up her screen.

My grandparents’ house is mine now. They passed within a year of each other, and as the only grandchild, the small, quiet house on the edge of town fell to me. I wasn’t ready to sell it. It’s a time capsule, filled with their sixty years of shared life. The faint scent of my grandmother’s lavender soap still clings to the bathroom towels. My grandfather’s worn-out paperback westerns are still stacked on his nightstand. Moving in felt less like a fresh start and more like becoming the new live-in caretaker of a museum of memories.

And in the center of the living room, like a king’s throne, sits the chair.

It’s a massive wingback armchair, upholstered in a dark, oxblood-red leather that’s cracked and worn smooth in all the right places. It’s a piece of furniture from an era when things were built to last forever. It’s imposing. It commands the room. And it was my grandfather’s favorite place on Earth. Every memory I have of him in this house, he’s in that chair. Watching the news, reading his books, falling asleep with his mouth slightly agape, a gentle snore rattling in his chest. It was his.

When I first moved in, I saw it as a piece of him I got to keep. A comforting presence. After a long day of unpacking boxes and sorting through a lifetime of trinkets, I’d sink into it. And that’s when the feeling would start.

It wasn't a bad feeling, not at first. It was just… heavy. The moment my back hit the worn leather, a profound, almost unnatural wave of exhaustion would wash over me. My eyelids would feel heavy. The deep cushions, which my grandmother was always plumping, seemed to sigh and settle around me, hugging me a little too tightly. The soft leather would creak like a contented groan. It was easy to let go. My thoughts would turn to mud, my focus would blur, and the silence of the house would be replaced by a low, humming drone in my ears.

The first few times, I’d catch myself just as I was about to nod off, shaking my head and pushing myself out of the chair’s deep embrace. It felt like surfacing from underwater. I’d stand up, feeling disoriented and strangely weak, my heart beating a little too fast. I chalked it up to stress, to the emotional and physical toll of the move.

But it kept happening. Every single time. I could be wired on three cups of coffee, but the second I sat in that chair, the sleepiness would hit me like a tranquilizer dart. It started to feel less like comfort and more like a strange, invisible force. I started to describe the sensation to myself as drowning. It felt like the chair was a pocket of deep, still water, and sitting in it was like stepping off a ledge. It pulled you down, into the quiet, into the dark.

I began to avoid it. I’d sit on the stiff, uncomfortable sofa instead. I’d eat at the kitchen table. But the chair was always there, in the corner of my eye. Watching. Waiting. Its deep red leather seemed darker in the evenings, absorbing the light in the room. I felt… judged by it. A piece of furniture. I know how insane that sounds.

About a month after I moved in, my mom came over to help me finish sorting through some old photo albums. She saw me perched on the edge of the sofa and smiled sadly.

“You’re not sitting in the chair,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

“Nah,” I said, trying to sound casual. “That thing’s dangerous. I sit in it for two seconds and I’m out for the count. It’s like a black hole for consciousness.”

Her smile faltered, just for a second. A strange, shadowy expression passed over her face before she smoothed it away. “Your grandfather was the same way. He could fall asleep in that chair in the middle of a marching band parade. He used to say it was the most comfortable thing he’d ever owned. Said it just… fit him.”

“It’s more than comfortable,” I found myself saying, the words tumbling out before I could stop them. “It’s… heavy. It feels like it’s pulling you in.”

My mom was quiet for a moment, her gaze fixed on the chair. The look in her eyes was one I’d never seen before. It was a complicated cocktail of love, grief, and something else. Something darker. Fear, maybe?

“He loved that chair to death, honey,” she said, her voice soft and final. She turned back to the photo album and changed the subject. The conversation was over.

Her words stuck with me. He loved that chair to death.

The incidents got stranger. One Saturday, I was exhausted from a long week. I made the mistake of just dropping into the chair for a moment to take my shoes off. Just for a moment. The next thing I knew, I was waking up. The room was dark outside. My neck was stiff, and a line of drool had dried on my chin. I checked my phone. It was 10 PM. I had lost seven hours. Seven hours, gone in an instant. I felt groggy, but more than that, I felt drained. Not like I’d had a restful nap, but like something had been siphoned out of me. My whole body ached with a deep, bone-weary fatigue.

I stood up, my legs unsteady, and looked at the chair. In the dim light from the streetlamp outside, I noticed something I hadn’t seen before. A dark stain. It was deep in the seat cushion, near the back, almost a part of the leather’s natural pattern, but not quite. It was a large, irregular shape, a few shades darker than the surrounding oxblood red. It looked… organic.

I spent the next day trying to clean it. I used leather soap, conditioner, everything I could find. But the stain wouldn't lift. It was like it wasn't on the leather, but in it. The more I scrubbed, the more I felt like I was just polishing a scar. And as I worked, a smell began to fill the room. It wasn't just the familiar scent of old leather and my grandfather’s pipe tobacco. It was something else, buried deep within the fibers of the chair. A faint, sickly-sweet, coppery odor. The smell of old meat.

I recoiled, my stomach churning. I started to feel a real, tangible fear of the chair. It wasn’t just a piece of furniture anymore. It was a place where I lost time. A thing with a stain that wouldn’t wash out and a smell that reminded me of a butcher’s shop.

The breaking point came last week. I was cleaning out the hall closet, a task I’d been putting off for months. It was full of my grandmother’s old coats, boxes of holiday decorations, and at the very back, a small, sealed cardboard box labeled “Personal Papers - DAD.” My mom must have packed it away after the funeral. My curiosity got the better of me. I figured it was just old bank statements and tax returns, but I felt I should go through it before tossing it.

It was mostly what I expected. But at the bottom, beneath a stack of old utility bills, was a bundle of letters, tied with a faded ribbon. They were letters my mother had written to her sister, my aunt, who lives across the country. They were dated from the summer two years ago. The summer my grandfather died.

I knew I shouldn't read them. It was a violation of privacy. But I was drawn to them, I needed to understand the weirdness my mom had shown, the feeling of wrongness that permeated the house, a feeling that was concentrated in that damned chair. I untied the ribbon. The first few were about his declining health, his refusal to go to the doctor. Then I got to the last one. The letter that explained everything. My hands began to shake as I read my mother’s familiar cursive.

“Dearest Sarah,

I’m sorry I haven’t been able to call. I haven’t been able to speak about it. The funeral was… it was what it was. But you need to know what actually happened. You need to know how we found him. The police report will say he died of a heart attack, and that’s true. But that’s not the whole story.

He hadn’t answered our calls for over a week. It was that awful heatwave in July, and I was so worried. We kept calling and calling. Finally, I used my spare key and went inside. The smell, Sarah… Oh, God, the smell. I’ll never get it out of my head. I thought an animal had died in the walls.

I found him in the living room. He was in his chair.

He had been there for the entire week. In the heat. I don’t want to write down the details. You don’t want to know them. Just… picture it. He was… he had become a part of it. The coroner said it was the worst he’s seen in twenty years. They had to… they had to practically peel him off the leather. So much of him had… soaked in.

They took him away, and I was left in the house with that… that thing. The chair. It was ruined. It was horrifying. It was covered in… him. I should have thrown it out. I should have burned it. Any sane person would have.

But I couldn't. It was his favorite chair. He spent half his life in it. It was the last thing that held him. It felt like throwing him away all over again. I know it sounds crazy. I know you’ll think I’ve lost my mind, but I called one of those specialty cleaning services. The kind that deals with crime scenes. They took it away for a week. They used chemicals, ozone treatments, I don’t know what else. They told me it was completely sanitized, completely clean. They said you’d never even know.

So I brought it back. It’s still there. Sometimes I look at it and all I can see is him, happy and reading his book. And other times, all I can see is how he was when I found him. I think keeping it was a mistake, Sarah. I think it holds more than just memories.”

I dropped the letter. My blood ran cold. I felt the bile rise in my throat.

The stain. The smell. The drowning feeling.

It wasn't my imagination. It wasn't a metaphor.

My grandfather had died in that chair. He had laid there for a week, in the sweltering summer heat, and his body had putrefied. It had decomposed. It had liquified and seeped and soaked into the cushions and the leather and the very frame of his favorite chair. The drowning sensation wasn’t just sleepiness. It was the chair, saturated with the finality of death, trying to do to me what it had done to him. It was the memory of decomposition, a physical echo of a body breaking down.

The chair hadn't just held him. It had consumed him.

I stumbled out of the closet, my legs like jelly, and stared into the living room. The chair was no longer a piece of furniture. It was a tombstone. A monument to decay. A predator disguised as a comfortable place to rest. The dark red leather looked like dried blood. The worn arms looked like grasping limbs. The deep cushion was a waiting maw. It had had a taste, and it had been sleeping ever since. Now I was here. I was its new meal.

I had to get it out. Now.

I grabbed one of the arms, intending to drag it out the front door. The moment my hand touched the leather, the feeling hit me, stronger than ever before. A wave of dizziness and exhaustion so profound my knees buckled. The air in the room grew thick and cold. I heard a sound, a low, wet, sighing sound, that seemed to come from the chair itself. It wasn't the creak of leather. It was the sound of a lung emptying for the last time. My arm felt impossibly heavy, glued to the chair. I felt a phantom weight settle on my shoulders, pushing me down, urging me to just sit. To just rest for a minute. To give in. To drown.

“No,” I gasped, wrenching my hand away as if from a hot stove.

My mind raced. I couldn’t just drag it out. It wouldn’t let me. It would drain me, pull me in, and finish me right here. I needed to destroy it. I needed to desecrate it so thoroughly that there was nothing left.

I ran to the garage. My hands found my grandfather’s old wood-splitting axe. It was heavy, the handle worn smooth from his grip. I walked back into the living room, my heart hammering against my ribs. The chair just sat there, waiting, radiating a palpable aura of hunger and death.

I didn't hesitate. I raised the axe over my head and brought it down with a scream of rage and terror.

The axe blade bit deep into the top of the wingback with a sickening, wet thump. It didn't sound like hitting wood and leather. It sounded like hitting flesh. A foul, sweet stench billowed out from the gash, a concentrated version of the smell I’d noticed before. It was the smell of the grave.

I didn't stop. I hacked and I tore and I ripped. I was a man possessed. With every swing, I felt the chair’s influence weaken. The sleepiness receded, replaced by a frantic, liberating energy. I splintered the wooden frame. I shredded the leather upholstery. I tore out handfuls of the deep, stained batting inside, which felt damp and spongy to the touch.

It took an hour. When I was done, the chair was gone. In its place was a pile of shredded, stinking refuse. I dragged the pieces, armful by armful, out into the backyard, onto the concrete patio. I doused the pile in lighter fluid and threw a match on it.

It went up with a roar. The flames burned a greasy, black-orange color. And the smoke… the smoke was thick and black and carried that same, horrific, sweet smell of decay across the entire neighborhood. It was the chair’s final, dying breath. I stood there until the pile was nothing but a scorched black circle on the concrete and a pile of glowing red embers.

The house feels different now. It’s lighter. The air is cleaner. The profound silence has returned, but it’s just empty now. It’s not waiting. But I can’t stop thinking about it. Was it just a chair? Just an object so saturated with a horrific event that it held a kind of psychic, toxic residue?

The axe blade bit deep into the top of the wingback with a sickening, wet thump. It didn't sound like hitting wood and leather. It sounded like hitting flesh. A foul, sweet stench billowed out from the gash, a concentrated version of the smell I’d noticed before. It was the smell of the grave.

I didn't stop. I hacked and I tore and I ripped. I was a man possessed. With every swing, I felt the chair’s influence weaken. The sleepiness receded, replaced by a frantic, liberating energy. I splintered the wooden frame. I shredded the leather upholstery. I tore out handfuls of the deep, stained batting inside, which felt damp and spongy to the touch.

It took an hour. When I was done, the chair was gone. In its place was a pile of shredded, stinking refuse. I dragged the pieces, armful by armful, out into the backyard, onto the concrete patio. I doused the pile in lighter fluid and threw a match on it.

It went up with a roar. The flames burned a greasy, black-orange color. And the smoke… the smoke was thick and black and carried that same, horrific, sweet smell of decay across the entire neighborhood. It was the chair’s final, dying breath. I stood there until the pile was nothing but a scorched black circle on the concrete and a pile of glowing red embers.

The house feels different now. It’s lighter. The air is cleaner. The profound silence has returned, but it’s just empty now. It’s not waiting. But I can’t stop thinking about it. Was it just a chair? Just an object so saturated with a horrific event that it held a kind of psychic, toxic residue?

My instinct was a Rolex GMT-II sprite, for the GMT function I never use to time some work calls, but I started to worry about safety and wondered if it was a bit risky.

I decided to list my watches and ask chatGPT and here is it's advice:

I thought this was pretty helpful and will probably run with the Cartier Santos with an assortment of straps. I even played with the idea with the Langematik perpetual as it has been my favorite and daily wear at home and I thought it was less identifiable as a fancy watch than Rolex or a Royal Oak.

My grandparents’ house is mine now. They passed within a year of each other, and as the only grandchild, the small, quiet house on the edge of town fell to me. I wasn’t ready to sell it. It’s a time capsule, filled with their sixty years of shared life. The faint scent of my grandmother’s lavender soap still clings to the bathroom towels. My grandfather’s worn-out paperback westerns are still stacked on his nightstand. Moving in felt less like a fresh start and more like becoming the new live-in caretaker of a museum of memories.

And in the center of the living room, like a king’s throne, sits the chair.

It’s a massive wingback armchair, upholstered in a dark, oxblood-red leather that’s cracked and worn smooth in all the right places. It’s a piece of furniture from an era when things were built to last forever. It’s imposing. It commands the room. And it was my grandfather’s favorite place on Earth. Every memory I have of him in this house, he’s in that chair. Watching the news, reading his books, falling asleep with his mouth slightly agape, a gentle snore rattling in his chest. It was his.

When I first moved in, I saw it as a piece of him I got to keep. A comforting presence. After a long day of unpacking boxes and sorting through a lifetime of trinkets, I’d sink into it. And that’s when the feeling would start.

It wasn't a bad feeling, not at first. It was just… heavy. The moment my back hit the worn leather, a profound, almost unnatural wave of exhaustion would wash over me. My eyelids would feel heavy. The deep cushions, which my grandmother was always plumping, seemed to sigh and settle around me, hugging me a little too tightly. The soft leather would creak like a contented groan. It was easy to let go. My thoughts would turn to mud, my focus would blur, and the silence of the house would be replaced by a low, humming drone in my ears.

The first few times, I’d catch myself just as I was about to nod off, shaking my head and pushing myself out of the chair’s deep embrace. It felt like surfacing from underwater. I’d stand up, feeling disoriented and strangely weak, my heart beating a little too fast. I chalked it up to stress, to the emotional and physical toll of the move.

But it kept happening. Every single time. I could be wired on three cups of coffee, but the second I sat in that chair, the sleepiness would hit me like a tranquilizer dart. It started to feel less like comfort and more like a strange, invisible force. I started to describe the sensation to myself as drowning. It felt like the chair was a pocket of deep, still water, and sitting in it was like stepping off a ledge. It pulled you down, into the quiet, into the dark.

I began to avoid it. I’d sit on the stiff, uncomfortable sofa instead. I’d eat at the kitchen table. But the chair was always there, in the corner of my eye. Watching. Waiting. Its deep red leather seemed darker in the evenings, absorbing the light in the room. I felt… judged by it. A piece of furniture. I know how insane that sounds.

About a month after I moved in, my mom came over to help me finish sorting through some old photo albums. She saw me perched on the edge of the sofa and smiled sadly.

“You’re not sitting in the chair,” she said. It wasn’t a question.

“Nah,” I said, trying to sound casual. “That thing’s dangerous. I sit in it for two seconds and I’m out for the count. It’s like a black hole for consciousness.”

Her smile faltered, just for a second. A strange, shadowy expression passed over her face before she smoothed it away. “Your grandfather was the same way. He could fall asleep in that chair in the middle of a marching band parade. He used to say it was the most comfortable thing he’d ever owned. Said it just… fit him.”

“It’s more than comfortable,” I found myself saying, the words tumbling out before I could stop them. “It’s… heavy. It feels like it’s pulling you in.”

My mom was quiet for a moment, her gaze fixed on the chair. The look in her eyes was one I’d never seen before. It was a complicated cocktail of love, grief, and something else. Something darker. Fear, maybe?

“He loved that chair to death, honey,” she said, her voice soft and final. She turned back to the photo album and changed the subject. The conversation was over.

Her words stuck with me. He loved that chair to death.

The incidents got stranger. One Saturday, I was exhausted from a long week. I made the mistake of just dropping into the chair for a moment to take my shoes off. Just for a moment. The next thing I knew, I was waking up. The room was dark outside. My neck was stiff, and a line of drool had dried on my chin. I checked my phone. It was 10 PM. I had lost seven hours. Seven hours, gone in an instant. I felt groggy, but more than that, I felt drained. Not like I’d had a restful nap, but like something had been siphoned out of me. My whole body ached with a deep, bone-weary fatigue.

I stood up, my legs unsteady, and looked at the chair. In the dim light from the streetlamp outside, I noticed something I hadn’t seen before. A dark stain. It was deep in the seat cushion, near the back, almost a part of the leather’s natural pattern, but not quite. It was a large, irregular shape, a few shades darker than the surrounding oxblood red. It looked… organic.

I spent the next day trying to clean it. I used leather soap, conditioner, everything I could find. But the stain wouldn't lift. It was like it wasn't on the leather, but in it. The more I scrubbed, the more I felt like I was just polishing a scar. And as I worked, a smell began to fill the room. It wasn't just the familiar scent of old leather and my grandfather’s pipe tobacco. It was something else, buried deep within the fibers of the chair. A faint, sickly-sweet, coppery odor. The smell of old meat.

I recoiled, my stomach churning. I started to feel a real, tangible fear of the chair. It wasn’t just a piece of furniture anymore. It was a place where I lost time. A thing with a stain that wouldn’t wash out and a smell that reminded me of a butcher’s shop.

The breaking point came last week. I was cleaning out the hall closet, a task I’d been putting off for months. It was full of my grandmother’s old coats, boxes of holiday decorations, and at the very back, a small, sealed cardboard box labeled “Personal Papers - DAD.” My mom must have packed it away after the funeral. My curiosity got the better of me. I figured it was just old bank statements and tax returns, but I felt I should go through it before tossing it.

It was mostly what I expected. But at the bottom, beneath a stack of old utility bills, was a bundle of letters, tied with a faded ribbon. They were letters my mother had written to her sister, my aunt, who lives across the country. They were dated from the summer two years ago. The summer my grandfather died.

I knew I shouldn't read them. It was a violation of privacy. But I was drawn to them, I needed to understand the weirdness my mom had shown, the feeling of wrongness that permeated the house, a feeling that was concentrated in that damned chair. I untied the ribbon. The first few were about his declining health, his refusal to go to the doctor. Then I got to the last one. The letter that explained everything. My hands began to shake as I read my mother’s familiar cursive.

“Dearest Sarah,

I’m sorry I haven’t been able to call. I haven’t been able to speak about it. The funeral was… it was what it was. But you need to know what actually happened. You need to know how we found him. The police report will say he died of a heart attack, and that’s true. But that’s not the whole story.

He hadn’t answered our calls for over a week. It was that awful heatwave in July, and I was so worried. We kept calling and calling. Finally, I used my spare key and went inside. The smell, Sarah… Oh, God, the smell. I’ll never get it out of my head. I thought an animal had died in the walls.

I found him in the living room. He was in his chair.

He had been there for the entire week. In the heat. I don’t want to write down the details. You don’t want to know them. Just… picture it. He was… he had become a part of it. The coroner said it was the worst he’s seen in twenty years. They had to… they had to practically peel him off the leather. So much of him had… soaked in.

They took him away, and I was left in the house with that… that thing. The chair. It was ruined. It was horrifying. It was covered in… him. I should have thrown it out. I should have burned it. Any sane person would have.

But I couldn't. It was his favorite chair. He spent half his life in it. It was the last thing that held him. It felt like throwing him away all over again. I know it sounds crazy. I know you’ll think I’ve lost my mind, but I called one of those specialty cleaning services. The kind that deals with crime scenes. They took it away for a week. They used chemicals, ozone treatments, I don’t know what else. They told me it was completely sanitized, completely clean. They said you’d never even know.

So I brought it back. It’s still there. Sometimes I look at it and all I can see is him, happy and reading his book. And other times, all I can see is how he was when I found him. I think keeping it was a mistake, Sarah. I think it holds more than just memories.”

I dropped the letter. My blood ran cold. I felt the bile rise in my throat.

The stain. The smell. The drowning feeling.

It wasn't my imagination. It wasn't a metaphor.

My grandfather had died in that chair. He had laid there for a week, in the sweltering summer heat, and his body had putrefied. It had decomposed. It had liquified and seeped and soaked into the cushions and the leather and the very frame of his favorite chair. The drowning sensation wasn’t just sleepiness. It was the chair, saturated with the finality of death, trying to do to me what it had done to him. It was the memory of decomposition, a physical echo of a body breaking down.

The chair hadn't just held him. It had consumed him.

I stumbled out of the closet, my legs like jelly, and stared into the living room. The chair was no longer a piece of furniture. It was a tombstone. A monument to decay. A predator disguised as a comfortable place to rest. The dark red leather looked like dried blood. The worn arms looked like grasping limbs. The deep cushion was a waiting maw. It had had a taste, and it had been sleeping ever since. Now I was here. I was its new meal.

I had to get it out. Now.

I grabbed one of the arms, intending to drag it out the front door. The moment my hand touched the leather, the feeling hit me, stronger than ever before. A wave of dizziness and exhaustion so profound my knees buckled. The air in the room grew thick and cold. I heard a sound, a low, wet, sighing sound, that seemed to come from the chair itself. It wasn't the creak of leather. It was the sound of a lung emptying for the last time. My arm felt impossibly heavy, glued to the chair. I felt a phantom weight settle on my shoulders, pushing me down, urging me to just sit. To just rest for a minute. To give in. To drown.

“No,” I gasped, wrenching my hand away as if from a hot stove.

My mind raced. I couldn’t just drag it out. It wouldn’t let me. It would drain me, pull me in, and finish me right here. I needed to destroy it. I needed to desecrate it so thoroughly that there was nothing left.

I ran to the garage. My hands found my grandfather’s old wood-splitting axe. It was heavy, the handle worn smooth from his grip. I walked back into the living room, my heart hammering against my ribs. The chair just sat there, waiting, radiating a palpable aura of hunger and death.

I didn't hesitate. I raised the axe over my head and brought it down with a scream of rage and terror.

The crazy stress and anxiety are gone, which I love. I now feel very calm. But... I am so calm that it borders with lethargy and very low motivation. I'm single and want to start a family before it's too late but I have no drive whatsoever to meet new people. I also have no sex drive and of lack of drive and motivation in my large in general. I want to do things, like see friends and do activities, but in a very slow pace, no hurry, no stress. I don't know how to explain, it's like I can't push through life and I rather to be taken by the current of life instead. 

But here's the thing. I first though the low motivation might be withdrawals but I recall I used to be like this my whole life. Before I ever started coffee 10 years ago throughout my entire life I remember moving very slowly through life, lacking motivation and drive in life in general...

I want to be clear that I have no desire to go back to tea or coffee, I hate how it makes me feel. I am not considering it at all. But I would love to hear if you struggle with motivation after quitting and before ever taking it? ",7,1749838459.0,decaf,6,1.0,False
