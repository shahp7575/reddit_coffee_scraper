The ransom note was written inside the house. 29 years later, her killer has never been found.","A 2½-page ransom note, opening with *“Listen carefully!”* and ending *“Victory! S.B.T.C.”*, was discovered just before 6:00 a.m. on December 26, 1996. It was handwritten on paper from inside the house, using a family pen, and demanded exactly $118,000. The same amount as John Ramsey’s recent work bonus. Investigators quickly noticed how strange that was: in real ransom cases, amounts are usually round figures, not oddly specific sums known only to a handful of people.

What followed was chaos. Police treated it as a kidnapping instead of a homicide. Neighbors and clergy were invited inside. Coffee was poured. Evidence was moved. Hours passed before anyone searched the entire house. At about 1:00 p.m., John Ramsey and a family friend went to the basement and found JonBenét in a small, windowless “wine cellar.” She was wrapped in a white blanket, duct tape across her mouth, and a nylon cord around her neck tied with the broken handle of Patsy Ramsey’s paintbrush. The autopsy ruled the cause of death as asphyxia by strangulation associated with craniocerebral trauma. A fatal combination of head injury and strangulation, but which came first has never been determined.

In the kitchen, police found a bowl of pineapple and milk; the same fruit was partially digested in JonBenét’s stomach. A Hi-Tec boot print was discovered near her body that didn’t match anyone in the family. A palm print on the basement door remains unidentified. The broken basement window that some believe the intruder used was explained by John Ramsey. He said he broke it himself weeks earlier after locking himself out. The well-known claim about undisturbed snow around the window, often cited as proof no one entered or exited, has been disputed by later investigators.

Partial male DNA was detected on JonBenét’s underwear and leggings. It didn’t match any family member, but the sample was extremely small, partially mixed, and vulnerable to contamination. Handwriting analysis excluded John Ramsey, couldn’t conclusively exclude Patsy, and ultimately remained inconclusive. In 1999, a grand jury reportedly voted to indict the Ramseys for child abuse resulting in death, but the district attorney declined to prosecute, citing insufficient evidence. In 2008, the family was publicly cleared based on touch DNA testing, though later experts questioned the strength of that finding.

What remains is a case that collapses under its own contradictions. The “Ramsey Did It” theory fits the note and the household evidence but lacks any clear forensic link. The “Intruder” theory fits the unidentified DNA and boot print but suffers from the absence of a credible entry point. Both rely on facts blurred by contamination and early investigative mistakes. The first 24 hours doomed the case: the crime scene wasn’t secured, the body was moved, and the evidence chain fractured beyond repair.

Nearly three decades later, Boulder PD claims to be working with outside labs to apply modern DNA and forensic genealogy. The hope is that one of those minutes, aging samples: the cord, the garrote, or the clothing might still hold a trace that technology can unlock. But optimism has often outpaced reality.

**Questions for the thread:** If you could run one modern test on one remaining piece of evidence, what would it be? The garrote? The ligatures? Her clothing? Does the $118,000 demand point to insider knowledge or deliberate misdirection? And if you could change just one thing from that morning: locking down the house, conducting a full search, or controlling the media  what do you think would have changed this case the most?",1,1762563262.0,mystery,0,1.0,False
1orbot7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sales/comments/1orbot7/anyone_else_grinding_like_crazy_getting_praised/,"Anyone else grinding like crazy, getting praised by leadership, but still stuck while others float to huge W2s?","Do B2B payroll sales at a big company. I am in a weird spot and I want people who have been through this to tell me what I am missing.

I had a couple strong months earlier this year, but the last five weeks have been rough. My VP uses my cold emails and Zoom calls as training examples. Reps ask me for my templates and wording. Managers tell me I am one of the hardest working people in the region.

And still, I have not closed anything in over a month.

Meanwhile my buddy on the team is destroying his number. He is chill, I like him, and this is not a hate post. He is sharp and knows the industry. But a lot of his success is that he brought a book of business from his last company. Those clients and partners now just send him more clients and even their friends and family. He will literally walk into random accounting firms or wealth advisors’ offices and they welcome him like he owns the place. He complains if he is not at 200 percent of quota by the first day of the month. I am grinding every day and I am not even at 100.

I am putting in 70 to 100 dials a day. I take brokers and CPAs to coffee. I hit networking events. I follow through. My referral sources actually like me and tell me they are impressed with my work… but they barely send anyone. They say they will keep me in mind, but nothing moves.

The part that gets in my head is watching reps who cannot write a clear email without ChatGPT make 250K W2s. Or guys who happened to get lucky inbound from a McKinsey client filling out a form online. Or someone’s dad’s friend introducing them to a CFO and suddenly they have a 40K deal.

I get that sales is not fair. I am not asking for fair. I am trying to figure out how to build real leverage instead of just doing more activity and hoping.

So here is my question to this sub:

If leadership thinks I am good, my partners respect my work, and my activity is high… but I still have no real pipeline momentum, what am I missing? How do you turn “people like and respect you” into “people actually send you business consistently”?

Is this a skill problem? A leverage problem? A targeting issue? Or a sign that I am not built for this long term?

Be blunt. I do not want comfort. I want clarity.

1orblt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayMen/comments/1orblt7/unhealthy_me/,Unhealthy me,"Hey everyone. I've recently told this community about my unhealthy relationship with my ex and our current unhealthy friendship.

Now I wanna focus on how unhealthy I am. 
I get attached to people too easily. I basically feel like I'm a lonely person and I don't have enough gay friends. In the place where I live, it is hard to find gay friends. I tried to use grinder but most of the guys in there show basically no interest in me. If I say let's meet for a coffee together, they maybe say yes in the first place but then they ghost me if I ask them when. I see from their social media that they have their own circle of friends, why can't I be included in it? Why are they so exclusive?

So I try to meet them for a hook up. And they refuse because they say I'm not attractive enough. OK but none of them is Brad Pitt tho. It seems impossible to find connection with other people.
If I find someone really interesting or that shares my own hobbies, I try to be friends with them to share some time together in a healthy way, but, by God's name, they seem to be bored by me. And if I ask them to meet more than twice, they turn me away telling me that I insist too much.

What's wrong with me? I try to be friendly, kind and sweet to everyone. I like human connection. And I'd like to have more of it in this place of desolation. We gay people are not many around here, but they have already their golden circle and nobody else is admitted.

This thing really hurts me. I feel wrong. I try with all of my energies to focus on the wrong things I could have made but I come to no result. I just try to be as kind as I can. I try not to make too private questions, I generally talk about people's hobbies, what they like to do in their free time, what they like to eat and something. Because I'm basically looking for friendship. Am I down for a hookup? Of course I am. But when it comes to me, people seem to escape me.
Everybody says I'm a handsome guy. Then why in the world gay people don't see me this way?
Can they feel my attachment issues? But I'm very discreet at that. I try to conceal it, I don't show people any attachment at all.
My only desire is to pass away soon. Recently I've got diagnosed with a serious heart disease. I hope that stress from personal life and job takes me to the end because I can't imagine myself being gay here and totally alone.

1orbha5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1orbha5,Here's my current thoughts after having started playing Legends ZA this week (lil review in description),"Most of these shots are purely cause I found them cool or humurous, XD

Anyhow I got Legends ZA last Monday and here's what I currently think.

The game runs so much better that Scarlet which is honestly a relief. I loved the game but gotta admit it had a flaws. So far ZA has been running pretty good on my Switch Lite, the only lagging area I've found is Wild Zone 8 (so, many, sand tombs).

The controls took a bit to get used too, the crouch and run button being the opposite of Scarlets had me confused for a bit but I'm definitely starting to get a hold of the reigns.
I was dizzy in my first few battles because I was spinning the camera way much more than I really needed too lol.

The tutorial as I've seen others speak of does take a long while, a lot of handholding for a game that works a lot better when your allowed to roam freely.
The tutorial also lasts over 5 days and nights in the games storyline, I don't think Thrash should've been the level needed to evolve into Croconaw before the Y rank promotion battle. 😅
 Afterwards though when I'm allowed to do what I want I get more enjoyment, even if story continuation does lead too many pauses at times. (I'm sorry Emma but no I cannot catch up to Zygarde because the game suddenly removed my ability to even roll)

The side missions are also very interesting and really add some character to the citizens all around Lumiose, I like the comedy scenes add like the infamous Raichu sidequest.

I've only experienced one rouge mega battle but I loved it and can't wait to do more down the line!

I haven't really gotten into character customization, mostly because I've gone poor feeding my Mon companions coffee and tea, I'm using the camera feature more than I expected! I wish I could feature more of those pictures here, possibly in another post.

To end it off I show my current team, and just a bit before posting I ended up getting Thrash to fully evolve, I wait to mega evolve him and the rest in my crew! 

So for what it's worth, I'll mention that I will admit, there are areas where the flat textures are very in your face and kinda bug me, but most times I really don't pay enough attention unless they're in my face as previously mentioned (that one path with the flat pillars urks me) 

So personally, I end it off (a second time) to say yeah, decent game, I can't wait to experience more and evolve my team in many ways! ",1,1762562504.0,PokemonZA,2,1.0,False

When Harry speaks Voldemort's name in Deathly Hallows, it activates the taboo that the death eaters have placed on speaking that name once they've taken control of the ministry.  It's a genius tactic and a really cool bit of magic though up by JK Rowling.

  
It's been asked many times why the trio doesn't disapparate.  I venture to think like many others that the taboo has blocked apparition, bc it wouldn't be a very valuable taboo if they can just disappear, and it's pointed out by Ron that Kingsley was caught by the taboo and needed to fight his way out.  If apparition was an option I'm sure Kingsley would have taken it as to avoid risk.

  
It's said that Kingsley fights, so why in the world do the 3 main characters just give up!?!?!?!  It makes no sense.  They are fighting for their lives and for the sake of wizarding kind.  Harry has personally battled Voldemort multiple times himself, Ron and Hermoine have also fought death eaters both at the ministry of magic, at Hogwarts in book 6, and earlier in the book at the coffee shop.  They are experienced and talented wizards, all with wands.

The snatchers aren't even powerful wizards!????  They have Greyback there, who is scary and formidable, but he doesn't even have a wand.  When the snatchers bring the crew to Malfoy manner, Beletrix silences them with ease, it's mentioned how the group of them combined would stand no chance against a witch like Beletrix.  If they were attacked by Beletrix (and they all have been ), the 3 of them would fight for their lives, so why the hell aren't they fighting a group of bozos????  I'm on my 3rd time through listening to Binge Mode, which if you haven't listened to, is the best HP podcast of all-time, and they just gloss over it.  It's driving me crazy.

My best friend of five years (24F) and I (23F) planned for me to visit her during her semester abroad. We were so excited and spent months planning things to do. I booked a three-week stay, long enough to explore without rushing and to give her time to study when needed. She told me to leave everything to her and focus on my solo plans.

A month before my trip, she told me her guy friend would be visiting for a week during my stay, and that we’d need to rearrange things so she could be with him. I was upset since I’d already booked hotels and appointments (tattoo, hair, etc.). She promised to make it up to me with a weekend trip to a neighbouring country and said the guy would help with luggage, take pictures, and pay for dinner. She said my being mad was unreasonable as he was “travelling so far to see her.” I gave in and hoped it would still be a good trip.

When I arrived, she said we’d explore the local area, a port city, and then cross the border for the weekend. In reality, it turned into three exhausting days of constant travel, barely a day in each place. She was tiring herself out and refused to go out or do anything, constantly belittled me, snapped at me over small things or got offended over everything.

By the end of the week, she left to meet the guy. We agreed to meet up later in the capital to salvage the trip. The first time, I waited two hours before she showed up alone. We went to a few stores and had a late lunch where she told me she was planning to go steady with him before heading back. The second time, we met for a beauty treatment. I asked if she wanted to do anything after, but she had to get back to their hotel. Later, she texted that they’d changed their minds and wanted to go sightseeing. I took three trains to meet them, after she sent wrong directions three times, only to find out they’d already left. She just said “oopsie” and stopped responding. I told her that our trip was over and to enjoy her time with her new man.

This was someone who used to visit me at work with coffee, plan trips with me, have wine nights, and be my biggest supporter. I was visiting her in my dream country and it was supposed to be amazing, but one week in, I regretted ever going. The country was beautiful, and I did my best to enjoy it, but I felt hurt, alone, and deeply disappointed.

Months later, she invited me to her “welcome home” party with friends to talk about her “wonderful time abroad.” I’d waited for her to acknowledge what happened, but she never did. So I finally sent a long message explaining how hurt and disappointed I was, how unfairly she’d treated me, and how angry I was that she ignored it. I ended it by saying ""I’d rather check myself into a psych ward than come to your s\*\*\*show!""

She unfollowed me on social-media. When mutual friends asked if she’d ever want to fix things, she said she’d love to, but was “so terribly busy.” AITA?",2,1762562276.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False
1orbec7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitnessplates/comments/1orbec7/fitbit_inspire_3_review_2025_the_ultimate_budget/,Fitbit Inspire 3 Review 2025: The Ultimate Budget Fitness Tracker for Health & Wellness,"# Introduction: A Fitness Tracker That Doesn’t Break the Bank

Okay, let’s be honest—most of us want to stay fit, sleep better, and feel less stressed, but we also don’t want to spend the same amount on a tracker as a month’s rent. That’s where the **Fitbit Inspire 3** swoops in like the underdog hero of 2025. It’s sleek, smart, and (thankfully) affordable. And after spending a few weeks with it strapped to my wrist, I can confidently say—it’s probably one of the **best budget fitness trackers** you can buy this year.

If you’re wondering whether it’s really worth your money or just another hyped-up gadget, stick around. This is my full **Fitbit Inspire 3 review**, told like a chat over coffee with a friend who’s just as obsessed with health tech as you are. ☕

# Design & Comfort: Lightweight but Not Cheap

Ever worn a fitness tracker that felt like a brick on your wrist? Yeah, the Inspire 3 is the total opposite. This little device weighs practically nothing, and it looks like something straight out of a minimalist’s dream.

I’ve worn it while working out, showering, and even sleeping—and half the time I forget it’s even there. The **silicone band feels soft**, and the **AMOLED color display** looks surprisingly premium for something under $100.

**Pros of the Design:**

* Super lightweight and comfy for all-day wear
* Color display with great brightness
* Water-resistant up to 50 meters (yes, you can swim with it)

**Cons:**

* Small screen, so you’ll squint a little when reading messages
* No built-in GPS (you’ll need your phone for tracking runs)

But hey, for a tracker that costs less than most AirPods, I can live with that.

# Fitness Tracking: Small Tracker, Big Brain

The Inspire 3 nails the basics—**steps, heart rate, calories, distance**, and all that good stuff. But here’s the fun part—it’s surprisingly accurate. I compared it to my **Garmin Vivosmart 5**, and honestly, the Inspire 3 held its own.

**Fitbit Inspire 3 vs Garmin Vivosmart 5:**

* **Accuracy:** Practically neck-and-neck for steps and heart rate.
* **Display:** Fitbit wins with that colorful AMOLED charm.
* **App Experience:** Fitbit’s app feels more polished and beginner-friendly.
* **Price:** Fitbit Inspire 3 wins by a landslide—seriously, it’s about half the cost.

If you’re just starting your fitness journey or you’re not training for the Olympics, this thing checks all the boxes.

# Heart Rate & Stress Tracking: Health in Real Time

Let’s talk about something that really impressed me—**Fitbit Inspire 3’s heart rate monitor**. It tracks your pulse 24/7 and gives you **real-time insights** during workouts. I noticed it even detected slight spikes when I got stressed (probably from scrolling social media too long, tbh).

The **stress management tools** are another win. Fitbit uses your heart rate variability and skin temperature to guess when you’re tense. It then suggests breathing exercises or short mindfulness breaks. Kinda like your chill friend reminding you to take a deep breath before losing it at the printer again.

**Why It’s Great:**

* Tracks stress and heart rate accurately
* Offers breathing reminders and relaxation sessions
* Syncs perfectly with Fitbit Premium for guided meditations

If mental health and stress control matter to you (and let’s be real, it does), this feature alone makes the Inspire 3 worth considering.

# Sleep Tracking: Your Bedtime Buddy

I’ve used plenty of trackers that claim to monitor sleep, but the **Fitbit Inspire 3 sleep tracking** is next-level. It doesn’t just tell you how long you slept—it breaks down your **REM, light, and deep sleep cycles** with crazy precision.

After a week, I started noticing patterns—like how late-night Netflix binges absolutely destroy my deep sleep (shocking, right?). The Fitbit app even gives you a **Sleep Score** each morning, which makes checking your sleep kinda addictive.

**Sleep Tracking Highlights:**

* Detailed sleep stages
* Smart insights to improve rest
* Gentle vibration alarm (way better than your phone’s annoying beep)

This feature alone makes the Inspire 3 feel like a **sleep optimization device** rather than just a tracker.

# Battery Life: The Real MVP

Here’s where things get impressive—the **Fitbit Inspire 3 battery life** lasts up to **10 days** on a single charge. Ten. Days.

I charged it once, wore it through workouts, showers, and sleep, and totally forgot about the charger. If you’re the type who hates plugging in devices every night (same here), this is a big win.

And FYI, even when the battery’s low, it still logs basic health data for hours before dying completely. So no sudden “oh no” moments mid-workout.

# Fitbit Inspire 3 Features and Benefits: Quick Rundown

Here’s a quick hit list of what makes this tracker such a standout:

* **24/7 heart rate monitoring**
* **Stress management reminders**
* **Sleep tracking with smart insights**
* **SpO2 and skin temperature tracking**
* **Water-resistant up to 50m**
* **Long 10-day battery life**
* **Affordable price under $100**
* **Access to Fitbit Premium features** (optional but nice)

This little gadget covers fitness, sleep, stress, and even mental wellness—making it one of the most **affordable fitness trackers under $100** in 2025.

# AI-Powered Health Insights: The Future Is (Kinda) Here

Fitbit has been quietly adding **AI-powered fitness tracking** tools behind the scenes, and it’s starting to show. The Inspire 3 uses algorithms to learn your habits—like when you’re most active, how your sleep affects your workouts, and when your stress levels spike.

It’s not like a sci-fi AI coach yet, but it’s definitely smart enough to make **personalized recommendations**. And for the price, that’s wild.

# The Verdict: Why Fitbit Inspire 3 Still Wins in 2025

So, after a few weeks of wearing it nonstop, what’s the verdict? The **Fitbit Inspire 3** is hands-down one of the **best budget fitness trackers of 2025**. It’s perfect for beginners, casual fitness lovers, or anyone who wants to improve their sleep and stress without dropping serious cash.

1orbdel,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1orbdel/searching_for_a_specialty_that_fits/,Searching for a specialty that fits,"**TL;DR:** I'm a 3-year nurse working in Med/Surg and feel like the level of chaos is outside of what I'm able to tolerate. I'm thinking something procedural like OR or GI lab. I'm hoping to stay in the hospital and preferably work 12-hour shifts, but I'm open to anything! Any advice is appreciated.

Hi all. I've been a nurse for 3 years and have struggled to find a nursing position that is a good fit for me. I started my nursing career at a small hospital in California with about 100 beds, working in Med/Surg. It was an interesting and challenging patient demographic, as a lot of the attending physicians also oversaw skilled nursing facilities, so most of our patients were acutely ill nursing home residents. I saw many elderly patients who were confused and unable to care for themselves, often due to dementia or stroke. It made me think a lot about the value of life and how far life-sustaining measures should be taken based on someone's quality of life.

After receiving my nursing license, as many of you know, the challenge of getting into a first job is daunting, with new grad applications and hiring periods. I had applied to this hospital, did an interview the next day, and was offered the position the day after that. And, obviously, I think that was due to the overall quality of the hospital. The rooms held 2–3 patients in pretty small spaces. Supplies and resources were poor. The management was not very supportive. I did make a pretty good group of friends who were all hired around the same time, mostly new grads. We all worked the same schedule, and we made it work. I was in this position for about a year and a half, working nights.

While I was in nursing school, I had worked as a caregiver. I enjoyed the opportunity to be involved with a patient/client in their own home. I heard many great stories and learned about long lives lived. Throughout nursing school, I was always fairly interested in the idea of home health nursing because of that job as a caregiver. Toward the end of my initial Med/Surg job, I was really struggling. My sleep schedule was a mess from working nights, and I felt like my patients were getting the better of me and my mental health. After having a horrible week in the hospital, I really felt like I couldn't do it anymore. I had some significant money saved up, so I put in my two weeks' notice to leave the Med/Surg position.

It took me about two months to find a home health job. With this, I was given two days of training, which were very lackluster, and was then sent on my way to see my patients and do the day-to-day of home health nursing. It was extremely challenging to get the routine of this job down. There is a lot of self-management involved and working from home. You have some freedom in picking and choosing the clients/patients you see and the times you see them. I worked in home health for about 8 months. It was a struggle. I had to be on-call every 6 weeks, which was an absolute nightmare. Any patients that couldn't be staffed would be sent to the on-call nurse, so you basically had to see twice as many patients during that week as normal. It involves a lot of charting, which is done at home (or a coffee shop or wherever you can be most productive). I worked from home because I didn’t feel like going to a coffee shop every day just to get my work done. So, I would see my 3–5 patients per day for about 5 hours, then get home and have to chart all the visits, usually taking another 2–3 hours. Just seeing the patients was exhausting since I was new and constantly running into issues I had never faced before. So, getting home and having to get more work done was near impossible at times. The charting would get backed up, and then over the weekends, I would have to catch up. I just felt like I was constantly worried about the charting and work. So, after 8 months, I left that job as well, without having anything lined up.

At the time, I felt like I wanted to get back into a floor position. A downside to home health nursing is that it's very isolating. You don't realize how nice it is in the hospital to be around other like-minded nurses and healthcare providers. It's fun to have so many personalities you're connected to and to be able to vent and joke around to dampen the stresses of being a nurse. But I wanted to work in a ""good"" hospital — one that was established, organized, well-resourced, and had good management, which my first job had lacked. And I did. After searching for a few months, I got hired at a Magnet hospital on an orthopedic Med/Surg floor. I thought that being at a “good” hospital, the level of chaos I struggled with in my first job would be less overwhelming. And it really is a good hospital. The doctors are great, the management is great, and the nurses are all great. But I’ve almost felt like the level of chaos is even more than in my first job.

My nurse manager says that over the years, the floor has gotten more difficult for nurses. Surgeries that normally had 2–3 days of recovery in the hospital are now discharging the next day after surgery. Recently, the hospital has changed most floors from being staffed with 3 CNAs to 2. Also, I’m now working days, which seems like more of a workload. My phone doesn’t stop ringing — families, rounding doctors, meals — these are things I didn’t deal with as much in my first hospital job. I’ve been here 6 months and have struggled. I often confide in my management and co-workers, who encourage me that I’m doing well and to stick with it. Most say that they weren’t comfortable until after 2 or 3 years of being on the unit.

I just don’t know that this is what I want for my job. I’m single. I live in a small studio apartment; my rent is low. I enjoy quiet, control, and little responsibility in my personal life. I’m focusing on meaning in my life and making a routine that brings me peace on my days off. Again, I just don’t know if this amount of chaos in Med/Surg nursing is what I want in my life. I know that no job will be easy. No job will be without its chaos. But I’m hoping there’s something out there with less — more predictability.

I have a close friend who is an OR nurse. He says it’s the hidden gem of nursing. And when I got hired in this new position, I met someone who was being hired for a travel OR position. She said if she still had to be a Med/Surg nurse, she wouldn’t be a nurse anymore. When my friend told me that sometimes they sit around and wait for cases, it absolutely blew my mind. I feel like there’s never a shift that I’m not going 100 miles per hour for 12 hours straight — and still feeling like it wasn’t enough time to get everything done.

I think I want to stay in the hospital. I REALLY like the 12-hour shift schedule, and hospital jobs seem to be the best paying. I expressed my concerns with my management, and they have been incredibly receptive. They’ve offered to let me shadow some other units and specialties. I’m thinking something procedural like OR or GI lab — that’s what comes to mind. Dealing with patients is a huge part of my stress and the chaos of floor nursing. It seems like interventional radiology usually has a prerequisite of ICU or ER, so I think that’s not an option.

Does anybody have any suggestions for specialties to avoid the chaos of floor nursing but stay in the hospital and preferably have 12-hour shifts? I’d really appreciate any advice or suggestions!!

**TL;DR:** I’m a 3-year nurse working in Med/Surg and feel like the level of chaos is outside of what I’m able to tolerate. I’m thinking something procedural like OR or GI lab.

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

1orb9ys,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1orb9ys/my_experience_at_cardiff_metropolitan_university/,My experience at Cardiff metropolitan University.,"


My first year at Cardiff met started off great I was happy imagine guy from east Africa I boarded a plane to come do my masters in the UK, I was accepted at so many universities university of Aberdeen,university of Portsmouth, university of sterling, and a bunch more both here and the United States I settle for the uk cause I loved the uk and couldn’t afford the United States, so I settle for Cardiff imagine my first day getting here rainy day and went to university (Cardiff met) I went to Cardiff met to get enrolled and settle in but I couldn’t start for a week, so when I started imagine my first day entering the class and being grabbed like a thief by the teacher, I had no idea but that encounter was the beginning of my torment by this person who would later scout a legion of evil
Minions to torment me, so she kept asking me in next following weeks why I took long to start my semester I explained further why I didn’t start in September but she kept asking and I kept telling her why my enrolment had issues especially with the university portal to access the timetable etc, so where things started to get weird was when I did my first two assignments m, I did make some mistakes I do admit to not reading the model guide or etc, but I was called in by one of my teachers to explain why I had used some A.i tools to do this assignments I explained and then that same white teacher showed up upset and she went to next room and slammed the table and said “AND” so I found it funny at the time but I had no idea this person would start a project of tormenting me in a weird way
And just to note (she mentioned she worked in Kenya for a while ) idk maybe I cat trust her around black people.
Her target towards me was rooted in hatred pure hate it was small moments I ignored  but later on would affect me.

A few months later I suspected I was being spied on on my phone etc my laptop by classmates could prove it at first, but later it was just showing a lot so I ignored it but then I started to go to counselling to get some help mentally because being here alone was stressful coping I needed help with my anxiety etc confidence build up you understand this cruel person wouldn’t understand they just kept being hateful towards me to hurt me mentally emotionally etc I’ve made some mistakes I will admit like trusting the wrong people but I deserved privacy in my counselling sessions and if she was honest she should have helped me instead she put my business out there to hurt me more now am destroyed mentally.
And being being a student at Cardiff met sucks it’s hard to make friends with those snobby people there I’ve had better conversations with students at other unis than at Cardiff met especially the white students at Cardiff met so yeah do t think you’ll have a good experience, so forget about everything being good or nice at across met maybe except having a good education and leaving for a better future, truth is my experience has sucked at Cardiff met that’s the truth, they will bully you, get into your devices and etc if you ask me there more racists at Cardiff metropolitan university than people care to admit it’s a problem they try to solve but subconsciously you can’t unroot that like someone tormenting you and forcefully  grabbing you like a thief on your first day of school maybe I was too much of a monkey to be in that class I’ll never know but hey atleast I’ve learned a lot, like doing the assignments better and studying in the uk system I just wish things turned out better but this is it for me.
I’ve come to the realisation that you can’t change people’s hatred that includes humiliating you dissing your shoe game (which actually hurt they said my shoes were fake )
The lesson here is I’ll learn to love myself more and care about my self more because hangs big heart will have you hurt at Cardiff met and let down, so if I could do this again I’d still join Cardiff met except a different course maybe, but I’ve learned that I can be patient and control my anger than I would a few years back.
Anyway the moral here is when you go to Cardiff met don’t expect much just go have your classes leave do the same thing over and over and over again. 
And I might be autistic explains a lot and I have Cardiff met to thank for that I could have gotten better help in my counselling if the evil lady didn’t spread my business out there.
So get ready to have classmates stalk you, get ready to be bullied by them or just teachers so keep that in mind.
It took me a year to accept that this was not right to be stereotyped as a new student have strangers in your devices people you study with don’t even know their homes.


Your good best years are behind you bless.
But just chill travel when your free see the uk you’ll fall in love with London it’s the most beautiful place on earth and I mean it so it’s not so bad take it step by step and Cardiff met does have some good coffee and the lunch lady makes good heavenly food it’s amazing try out the Wednesday special you’ll love it, check out the library the reading rooms are amazing. Don’t forget to see the Tesco it has everything it’s like you dream store and you can walk across the park to the city centre if your bored, that and the gym is fun at least it used to be, but I’d suggest you try and socialize with at least as many black people as possible don’t count on the white peers to understand any situation but there some who will so don’t worry this post is not a hatred post to Cardiff met it’s my experience to having haters all year round at Cardiff met and still shinning my light bright as ever so yes you can still choose Cardiff met just protect your phone better your laptop and don’t go to Bonnie’s the club it’s shit, circuit is weird and uncomfortable too loud and the floors are wet drink spills and you’ll run into people from your accommodation a lot, trust me you’ll thank me later, I’d suggest going to you know what take it from me I’ve seen all the party spots in Cardiff and it’s basic but new moon is awesome it’s closed tho so riddles lol your ahhhh doomed  but peppermint is amazing next to Bonnie’s yeah and just do more research on how to do the assignments ignore the racists, supremacists etc do you I asked for an African association I was  shutdown and they held a humiliation ritual dissed my sneakers and claimed victory, the psychopaths remain at large as ever but am still growing starting my new business looking for full time work grinding hustling my dark beautiful black skin is still glowing the haters are crying seeing me thriving my essence of greatness to come.

They thought it was hate on my end, despite all the bullshit thrown at me trust me I’ve been through a lot but still taking it slow I know what should have done when I got here so I hope you get that guidance reach out to any person who can help you better not everyone will at the met we know that only a few will forget about tech help they always are angry and biased asf for some reason and everybody has a stick up there ass there they should laugh more at cmet and get  a part time job as soon as possible, it helps detract you and give you a better routine, and it’s not easy to get a part time job so be ready to do anything don’t worry about it it’s fine just get the paper work needed early, certificates for hospitality, security maybe care, you’ll need that money no job is beneath you trust me that money will help give you more freedom here and you can travel during the holidays etc.
Just keep to your self if you try to make friends and they’re uptight and have a stick up their asses ignore them do you you’ll find your crowd so just indeed the basics in order, assignments, stay away from the racists, protect your phone’s devices ( always draw the line when it comes to privacy always), have many emails, expect weirdos in ya business, don’t be too flashy, spend less, there’s nothing to do on Sundays, and travel during the summer take those jobs save up because you’ll thank me later when the summer comes you’ll see big global artists come to the Uk and that money will give you memories for life and it’s is beautiful especially London.
But the basics are teachers will bully you at some point, students will, racists will test you just be you focus on what matters, the counselling sessions do help but haters will creep in to sabotage, get help but don’t open up too much saboteurs at large at the met like cayotees and the rest you’ll figure it out.

So I hope that helps my experience was shitty but maybe I can help the next person find better map out.

Ps. I’ll give an update in a few years or months.

WHAT THIS MEANS (FOR NORMAL PEOPLE)
Someone with military or intelligence training (perfect printing, anti-tamper paper folds, same font everywhere) has been hiding these exact notes in food boxes and on hiking trails since 2019.
They are warning that:

1. An ancient race with elongated skulls (real skulls found in museums) secretly runs the world through elites.


2. Corporate logos and hand signs are their secret communication.


3. The end goal is total control: digital ID, no cash, no guns, chaos to justify martial law.


4. America is target #1 because its citizens are armed.

1orb5hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1orb5hr/my_experience_at_cardiff_metropolitan_university/,My experience at Cardiff metropolitan university.,"
My first year at Cardiff met started off great I was happy imagine guy from east Africa I boarded a plane to come do my masters in the UK, I was accepted at so many universities university of Aberdeen,university of Portsmouth, university of sterling, and a bunch more both here and the United States I settle for the uk cause I loved the uk and couldn’t afford the United States, so I settle for Cardiff imagine my first day getting here rainy day and went to university (Cardiff met) I went to Cardiff met to get enrolled and settle in but I couldn’t start for a week, so when I started imagine my first day entering the class and being grabbed like a thief by the teacher, I had no idea but that encounter was the beginning of my torment by this person who would later scout a legion of evil
Minions to torment me, so she kept asking me in next following weeks why I took long to start my semester I explained further why I didn’t start in September but she kept asking and I kept telling her why my enrolment had issues especially with the university portal to access the timetable etc, so where things started to get weird was when I did my first two assignments m, I did make some mistakes I do admit to not reading the model guide or etc, but I was called in by one of my teachers to explain why I had used some A.i tools to do this assignments I explained and then that same white teacher showed up upset and she went to next room and slammed the table and said “AND” so I found it funny at the time but I had no idea this person would start a project of tormenting me in a weird way
And just to note (she mentioned she worked in Kenya for a while ) idk maybe I cat trust her around black people.
Her target towards me was rooted in hatred pure hate it was small moments I ignored  but later on would affect me.

A few months later I suspected I was being spied on on my phone etc my laptop by classmates could prove it at first, but later it was just showing a lot so I ignored it but then I started to go to counselling to get some help mentally because being here alone was stressful coping I needed help with my anxiety etc confidence build up you understand this cruel person wouldn’t understand they just kept being hateful towards me to hurt me mentally emotionally etc I’ve made some mistakes I will admit like trusting the wrong people but I deserved privacy in my counselling sessions and if she was honest she should have helped me instead she put my business out there to hurt me more now am destroyed mentally.
And being being a student at Cardiff met sucks it’s hard to make friends with those snobby people there I’ve had better conversations with students at other unis than at Cardiff met especially the white students at Cardiff met so yeah do t think you’ll have a good experience, so forget about everything being good or nice at across met maybe except having a good education and leaving for a better future, truth is my experience has sucked at Cardiff met that’s the truth, they will bully you, get into your devices and etc if you ask me there more racists at Cardiff metropolitan university than people care to admit it’s a problem they try to solve but subconsciously you can’t unroot that like someone tormenting you and forcefully  grabbing you like a thief on your first day of school maybe I was too much of a monkey to be in that class I’ll never know but hey atleast I’ve learned a lot, like doing the assignments better and studying in the uk system I just wish things turned out better but this is it for me.
I’ve come to the realisation that you can’t change people’s hatred that includes humiliating you dissing your shoe game (which actually hurt they said my shoes were fake )
The lesson here is I’ll learn to love myself more and care about my self more because hangs big heart will have you hurt at Cardiff met and let down, so if I could do this again I’d still join Cardiff met except a different course maybe, but I’ve learned that I can be patient and control my anger than I would a few years back.
Anyway the moral here is when you go to Cardiff met don’t expect much just go have your classes leave do the same thing over and over and over again. 
And I might be autistic explains a lot and I have Cardiff met to thank for that I could have gotten better help in my counselling if the evil lady didn’t spread my business out there.
So get ready to have bullies for teachers, older students who stalk your phone, and just hateful white teachers or stalkers.
The stalking is a bigger issue at Cardiff met than you’ll expect.

Your good best years are behind you bless.
But just chill travel when your free see the uk you’ll fall in love with London it’s the most beautiful place on earth and I mean it so it’s not so bad take it step by step and Cardiff met does have some good coffee and the lunch lady makes good heavenly food it’s amazing try out the Wednesday special you’ll love it, check out the library the reading rooms are amazing. Don’t forget to see the Tesco it has everything it’s like you dream store and you can walk across the park to the city centre if your bored, that and the gym is fun at least it used to be, but I’d suggest you try and socialize with at least as many black people as possible don’t count on the white peers to understand any situation but there some who will so don’t worry this post is not a hatred post to Cardiff met it’s my experience to having haters all year round at Cardiff met and still shinning my light bright as ever so yes you can still choose Cardiff met just protect your phone better your laptop and don’t go to Bonnie’s the club it’s shit, circuit is weird and uncomfortable too loud and the floors are wet drink spills and you’ll run into people from your accommodation a lot, trust me you’ll thank me later, I’d suggest going to you know what take it from me I’ve seen all the party spots in Cardiff and it’s basic but new moon is awesome it’s closed tho so riddles lol your ahhhh doomed  but peppermint is amazing next to Bonnie’s yeah and just do more research on how to do the assignments ignore the racists, supremacists etc do you I asked for an African association I was  shutdown and they held a humiliation ritual dissed my sneakers and claimed victory, the psychopaths remain at large as ever but am still growing starting my new business looking for full time work grinding hustling my dark beautiful black skin is still glowing the haters are crying seeing me thriving my essence of greatness to come.

They thought it was hate on my end, despite all the bullshit thrown at me trust me I’ve been through a lot but still taking it slow I know what should have done when I got here so I hope you get that guidance reach out to any person who can help you better not everyone will at the met we know that only a few will forget about tech help they always are angry and biased asf for some reason and everybody has a stick up there ass there they should laugh more at cmet and get  a part time job as soon as possible, it helps detract you and give you a better routine, and it’s not easy to get a part time job so be ready to do anything don’t worry about it it’s fine just get the paper work needed early, certificates for hospitality, security maybe care, you’ll need that money no job is beneath you trust me that money will help give you more freedom here and you can travel during the holidays etc.
Just keep to your self if you try to make friends and they’re uptight and have a stick up their asses ignore them do you you’ll find your crowd so just indeed the basics in order, assignments, stay away from the racists, protect your phone’s devices ( always draw the line when it comes to privacy always), have many emails, expect weirdos in ya business, don’t be too flashy, spend less, there’s nothing to do on Sundays, and travel during the summer take those jobs save up because you’ll thank me later when the summer comes you’ll see big global artists come to the Uk and that money will give you memories for life and it’s is beautiful especially London.
But the basics are teachers will bully you at some point, students will, racists will test you just be you focus on what matters, the counselling sessions do help but haters will creep in to sabotage, get help but don’t open up too much saboteurs at large at the met like cayotees and the rest you’ll figure it out.

So I hope that helps my experience was shitty but maybe I can help the next person find better map out.

Ps. I’ll give an update in a few years or months.

1orb573,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeOvens25/comments/1orb573/ronco_modern_rotisserie_oven_large_capacity_meets/,Ronco Modern Rotisserie Oven: Large Capacity Meets Versatile Cooking,"If you’ve ever stood in front of your oven watching a chicken roast for two hours and thought, “There’s got to be a better way,” then buddy, I’ve got some news for you. The **Ronco Modern Rotisserie Oven** isn’t just another kitchen gadget—it’s basically your new secret weapon for perfectly juicy, evenly cooked meals that make you feel like a pro chef (minus the stress and smoke alarms).

So, grab your coffee (or wine, I’m not judging) and let’s talk about why this large capacity rotisserie oven deserves a permanent spot on your countertop.

# Why the Ronco Modern Rotisserie Oven Deserves the Hype

You’ve probably heard of rotisserie cooking from your local grocery store’s shiny display of spinning golden chickens. The **Ronco Modern Rotisserie Oven** brings that same magic into your home kitchen. And it doesn’t just handle chicken—it can roast a **12lb turkey**, slow-cook ribs, or crisp up vegetables to perfection.

What I love most is how it **self-bastes**. That means while you’re scrolling through your phone or pretending to tidy up, the oven is doing the heavy lifting—rotating your food slowly and locking in all those natural juices. It’s like having a personal chef who never complains.

**Key specs that make it shine:**

* **12lb capacity rotisserie oven** – perfect for family meals or holiday feasts
* **Self-basting rotisserie technology** – keeps meats tender and flavorful
* **Energy-efficient countertop design** – uses less power than a full-sized oven
* **Easy-to-use rotisserie controls** – no culinary degree required
* **Multi-purpose rotisserie basket** – ideal for veggies, fish, or even fries

Basically, this thing doesn’t just roast—it *shows off*.

# Cooking Versatility That’ll Make You Rethink “One-Trick” Ovens

You might think, “Okay, cool, it spins food. Big deal.” But hold up. The **Ronco countertop oven** can do way more than roast chicken.

# It’s a Multi-Cook Marvel

The **multi-purpose rotisserie basket** lets you cook almost anything:

* **Whole chickens** that actually fit (no need to squish or tie wings awkwardly)
* **Vegetables** that come out crispy, not soggy
* **Seafood**, like salmon or shrimp, that stays tender inside
* **Homemade fries** that rival your favorite diner

The secret lies in the slow rotation and even heat distribution. Every inch of your food gets equal attention—no overcooked corners or raw middles.

And IMO, this oven beats a traditional **air fryer** when it comes to flavor. Sure, air fryers are trendy, but nothing matches that natural self-basting juiciness you get from a rotisserie.

# My First Roast: A Kitchen Win (For Once)

Let me share a little story. I decided to test the **Ronco Modern Rotisserie Oven** on a lazy Sunday. I threw in a 5lb chicken, seasoned it with lemon and herbs, and set it to roast. Normally, I’d be checking every 10 minutes to make sure I didn’t burn down my kitchen.

But not this time. The Ronco handled everything. The **easy-to-use controls** made setup a breeze—just set the timer, temperature, and walk away. Two hours later, I pulled out a golden, crackly-skinned bird that could’ve been in a cooking magazine. The best part? My kitchen smelled amazing, and cleanup took less than five minutes.

Ever wondered why this oven works so well? It’s because of the **rotating spit rod** that ensures even browning and the **drip tray** that keeps things clean and crisp. Whoever designed that deserves a high five.

# The Tech Behind the Taste

Let’s geek out for a second. The **Ronco Modern Rotisserie Oven** isn’t just fancy—it’s *smart*.

# What Makes It Tick

* **Rotisserie oven temperature settings:** Adjustable for precise cooking
* **Self-basting rotation:** Keeps food juicy without constant checking
* **Energy efficiency:** Cooks faster using less energy than your main oven
* **Removable glass door:** Makes cleaning painless
* **Auto shut-off:** So you can’t “accidentally” overcook your masterpiece

Basically, it’s like the Tesla of countertop ovens—efficient, good-looking, and way more advanced than you’d expect.

Had a fight and nearly ended myself.","Basically I have a partner for 4 years and every time I drink with him it turns to shit, doesn’t get physical just fights, when I drink with other people this doesn’t happen. I constantly am blamed for the way I am with my partner. With me being aggressive and upset, but I am being upset over things he is upsetting me about so it only makes sense to be? 

He had another x here which I was totally chill with him seeing, we saw him at his work and I was 100% fine with it. I said hello got a coffee and I let them talk while I walked around the city, then my bf calls me that he’s done, happy days, But he keeps making fun of me if I’m gonna pop off or something, I’m like no unless I need to? You know?

But I’ve been told I’m too much and I’m crazy and aggressive. I have tried my best to lower myself but last night I snapped and yelled, like yelled like a Fkn demon for about 10 seconds that my throat is sore, I threw my chips on the road when we were walking back from the club. After that I calmed down and I said I’d like to please discuss what just happened but he wouldn’t have a bar of it, so I being drunk said I’m keeping us up until we talk about it, he still refuses, I know I’m being toxic but in my head so is he. We argue some more and I leave the room. 

We are in a hotel at the moment, our second trip away over seas, it was going so well. So much fun and photos, but the club and alcohol happened.

I wanted to jump off the building, I’ve been suffering from insomnia for a year now and it’s made me real stressed and depressed, I decided to go back to bed after going to the rooftop of the hotel.

I do get angry when I drink, but it’s mainly cause my bf flirts with others and it upsets me, this time he wanted to sleep with someone I have slept with 2 years ago(we had a break) i wasn’t happy about that but he said he wants to anyway. 

He doesn’t invite me to small events anymore or gatherings, even light gatherings with 3 or so people, I feel so lonely and left out. 

When he went out last time with a friend I drank myself till I spewed, I was just at home with my flatmate in the other room, I was crying constantly and drinking that night. 

I really love him, I do. But when these situations happens I can’t help to think we aren’t meant to be together, I’m over being blamed, even now he would just say I’m playing the victim card. 
I’m not, I’m trying to express what I’m thinking and feeling and this is it. I don’t want this sort of thoughts or attitude and attention. 

He tells some people mainly his x about what has happened and it circles round the community about what I’m like. So I’ve got this dark shadow over me from other people I don’t know. 

I’ve given him lots of my time and effort, I gifted him 20k I also got a house that would suit his job for us to live in but he decided not to move in once I got it. I used to make him dinners and deliver it to his house, I pick up groceries for him when he asks, I do his laundry if it’s overflowing. I do like doing that as it’s a way I show love but I also feel used and he doesn’t seem to tell people the good only the bad. 

I feel motionless, I am numb, I am tired, I can’t feel like myself I hate myself and people hate me.

I was originally from Kent, so I'm still learning the area, but I'm eager to meet like minded people and hopefully make some good friends 😊

Anyone who wants to play DND? Any LGBTQ+ groups around? Maybe there's some fitness groups for those who just need company to make sure they go to the gym? 😂

Things about myself: 
As stated I'm a 28 year old woman. I identify as pansexual and am in a semi-long distance relationship with my lovely girlfriend. I'm pretty confident and outgoing, though I quite enjoy more intimate get-togethers nowadays than the likes of clubbing (not opposed to a night out, but I think I favour cinema trips and coffee dates). I'd like to say I'm quite creative with hobbies that reflect! I'm an aspiring writer as well as self taught digital artist, and I studied songwriting in university (though I haven't done anything musically ""professional"" in years). I'd say I'm pretty ""geeky/needy"", at least I'm very into gaming (Baldur's Gate 3 and the Borderlands franchise are my fave games), and I've gotten big into dnd within the last 2 years. A friend of mine also bought me the beginner box for MTG so I'm hoping to learn and play that!  

I'm not sure what else to say, I don't want to dump too much into one post. But yeah! If anyone knows of places good to meet people in their 20s/30s just to make friends, or maybe someone has some dnd games going, or wants to talk... Hit me up!

I usually enjoy iced Americanos, but honestly, the coffee flavor isn’t that great. I tried to figure out why the coffee didn’t taste as good as I wanted, and I concluded that it’s probably because of the brewer size. Most fully automatic machines have a portafilter capacity of about 8–12g, right? On the other hand, a proper semi-automatic machine usually has a portafilter capacity of around 16–22g.

So, I looked for fully automatic machines with a slightly larger portafilter (or brewer) capacity. Among De’Longhi models with a “Doppio” function and higher-end Jura machines, they usually have around 16g. They’d be better than what I’m using now, but still a bit underwhelming.

Then I found a machine called the Jetinno JL05 Pro. You’ve probably never heard of it—it’s made by a Chinese company.

To give a quick overview of the specs: it has a brewer capacity of 8–20g and a 64mm steel flat burr grinder, which they claim is high quality. It also has an automatic latte system and some app features.

For me, the important thing is the brewer capacity. As far as I know, this model has the largest brewer capacity among fully automatic machines.

It costs around $1,000, but is it worth taking a risk just for the larger brewer size?

I wish I could test it out, but unfortunately, consumer protection laws here in Korea aren’t that great. That means if I buy it, I basically can’t return it.

I’m not sure if I can share the link, but here’s the product page on the company’s global website. They list it as having a 14g brewer, but the same model with a 20g brewer (the Pro version) seems to be released only in Korea.

A few months ago, I started an internship at a company here in Jordan. I was hopeful. I told myself, “Work hard, be patient, prove yourself — they’ll hire you after 3 months.”

For three months I showed up every day. No salary.. Just “training.” But it wasn’t really training — they used me. I spent my days entering bills, doing repetitive work that actual employees are paid for. No real teaching, no guidance, no appreciation. Just, “Do this, finish that.”

Still, I stayed because they kept promising:
“When the 3 months end, we’ll hire you. You’ll get a full salary. Just be patient.”

Three months passed.

No contract. No salary. Nothing.

Instead, they said:
“Stay longer. We’ll extend your training. We’ll give you 100 JOD a month until we decide. If you prove yourself, maybe we’ll hire you.”

100 JOD.
Less than what some people spend on fuel or coffee in a month. For full-time work. Like my time, effort and mental health were worth nothing. I felt like a disposable tool. Not an intern — a slave.

I was exhausted. Not just physically — mentally. I’d go home feeling empty. I stopped enjoying life. Games, music, friends, even the idea of marriage or a future — nothing felt exciting anymore. Just numbness, like I was stuck in a loop I couldn’t escape.

When I finally left, they made me sign the clearance form and said, “We’ll send your experience certificate.” Today, they told me, “Come get it yourself.” After using me for 3 months and offering me 100 JOD to keep me like a servant — now I have to chase them for a paper.

I even spoke to a lawyer in the family. He told me legally, I can’t do anything. No contract, no proof, no case. Just a lesson.

I don’t want sympathy. I just want people to know this happens. This is what some companies do to young people desperate to start their careers. They take your hope, your effort, your mental health — and offer you 100 JOD in return.

If you’re going through something like this — it’s not your fault. You’re not weak. You’re just human.

1orapxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoFrance/comments/1orapxe/the_333_dating_rule_your_secret_weapon_for/,The 3-3-3 Dating Rule: Your Secret Weapon for Finding a Real Connection,"In the whirlwind world of modern dating, it's easy to feel burnt out. You're swiping through endless profiles, engaging in conversations that go nowhere, and going on first dates that feel more like job interviews than romantic connections. Ghosting has become the norm, and the pressure to feel an instant, movie-like ""spark"" can make you give up on someone amazing before you've even had a chance to know them.

What if there was a simple, practical framework to cut through the noise? A method designed to foster deeper connection and filter out the time-wasters?

Enter the **3-3-3 rule**. It's been gaining traction on TikTok, in dating forums, and among relationship experts as a powerful tool for a more intentional dating life.

So, **what is the 3 3 3 rule for dating**, exactly? Let's break it down.

***

### ## What Exactly Is the 3-3-3 Rule?

The 3-3-3 rule is a guideline for the early stages of dating that creates structure and encourages a more measured, thoughtful approach. It’s not about playing games; it’s about giving a potential connection the best possible chance to succeed.

It works like this:

*   **The First 3: Three Days of Chatting Online**
    Before suggesting a date, commit to at least three days of conversation on the app or via text. This isn't just idle small talk. The goal is to move beyond ""Hey, how's your day?"" and start gauging personality, values, and conversational chemistry.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=What%20is%20the%203%203%203%20rule%20for%20dating%3F)

*   **The Second 3: Three Hours on the First Date**
    Ditch the 30-minute coffee date. The 3-3-3 rule suggests planning a first date that lasts for about three hours. This extended time allows you to move past first-date jitters and have a real experience together, revealing much more about a person than a quick chat can.

*   **The Third 3: Three Dates Before Making a Judgment**
    Commit to going on at least three dates before you decide whether this person has long-term potential. This crucial step combats the ""insta-spark"" fallacy and gives you both time to relax, be yourselves, and see if genuine compatibility is growing.

***

### ## Why Does the 3-3-3 Rule Actually Work?

It might sound simple, but this structure is psychologically sound. It counteracts many of the pitfalls of modern dating.

#### ### It Filters Out Low-Effort and Time-Wasting Matches

The **three-day chat** acts as an initial filter. Someone who isn't willing to invest a few days of thoughtful conversation is unlikely to invest the effort needed for a real relationship. It quickly weeds out those looking for a quick hookup or an ego boost.

#### ### It Encourages More Meaningful First Dates

A **three-hour date** is a game-changer. Why?
*   **You get past the ""performance"" phase.** The first 30 minutes of any date are often awkward and performative. By the second hour, you start to see the real person.
*   **It creates shared experiences.** Whether you're walking through a museum, playing mini-golf, or having a long dinner, you're creating memories and observing how a person interacts with the world, not just with you across a table.
*   **You can cover more ground.** You can talk about passions, past experiences, and future dreams—the stuff that actually matters.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=What%20is%20the%203%203%203%20rule%20for%20dating%3F)

#### ### It Cures the Epidemic of Premature Evaluation

We're all guilty of it. We go on one date, don't feel fireworks, and instantly write the person off. But deep, lasting compatibility—built on shared values, trust, and mutual respect—is often a slow burn. The **three-date rule** gives you a chance to:
*   See them in different contexts (e.g., a daytime walk, an evening drink, a fun activity).
*   Observe how they handle stress or small disagreements.
*   Allow attraction and comfort to build naturally. That initial ""spark"" is often just lust or infatuation. Real connection is cultivated.

***

### ## How to Apply the 3-3-3 Rule in Your Dating Life (A Practical Guide)

Ready to try it? Here’s how to put the 3-3-3 rule into action.

*   **Step 1: The 3-Day Chat - Go Deeper**
    Use this time to ask questions that reveal character. Instead of ""What do you do for work?"", try ""What's the most rewarding part of your job?"" or ""What are you passionate about outside of work?"" Look for consistency and engagement in their replies.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=What%20is%20the%203%203%203%20rule%20for%20dating%3F)

*   **Step 2: The 3-Hour Date - Plan an Experience**
    Your goal is an activity that facilitates conversation and isn't too high-pressure. Think:
    *   A visit to a botanical garden or museum.
    *   A walk through a cool neighborhood followed by a drink.
    *   A casual board game café.
    *   A cooking or pottery class.
    The key is to have something to *do* and talk about beyond just staring at each other.

*   **Step 3: The 3-Date Evaluation - Stay Open**
    This is the hardest part. After each date, resist the urge to make a final judgment. Instead, ask yourself:
    *   ""Did I enjoy my time with this person?""
    *   ""Did I feel respected and comfortable?""
    *   ""Am I curious to learn more about them?""
    If the answer is yes, schedule the next date. By the end of the third date, you'll have a much clearer, more holistic picture of who they are and whether you're truly compatible.

***

### ## Is the 3-3-3 Rule a Magic Bullet? Potential Downsides

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=What%20is%20the%203%203%203%20rule%20for%20dating%3F)

No rule is perfect, and the 3-3-3 rule is a guideline, not a law. Here’s what to watch out for:

*   **It can feel rigid.** If you have an amazing connection and the vibe is right, you don't need to force a three-day chat or wait for a specific timeline. The point is intention, not rigidity.
*   **Trust your gut.** This is the most important caveat. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, sense a major red flag, or just don't feel safe, **do not continue.** The 3-3-3 rule is for giving potential connections a fair shot, not for ignoring your intuition.

***

### ## The Final Verdict: Is the 3-3-3 Rule Right for You?

If you're tired of the swipe-and-ghost cycle and want to approach dating with more purpose and less anxiety, the 3-3-3 rule is an excellent framework. It helps you slow down, invest in quality over quantity, and make clearer-headed decisions about who is truly worth your time.

It won't magically lead you to ""The One,"" but it will dramatically increase your chances of building a genuine connection by giving potential relationships the time and space they need to breathe.

Tska sobrang creative and interesting ng mga flavors nila, nakakainspire. Tinry ko yung coffee cola, ayos sya! Gusto ko ring itry yung patis coffee - maybe mamaya or tomorrow haha.

Just one thing, super matao at maliit ang venue. Pero sa opening ako nagpunta so it might be because of that. Syempre andun sila Mayor kaya complete attendance lahat. Baka today and tomorrow mas dispersed na ang mga tao.

Di na ako nagstay after bumili ng kape, pero buti malapit lang ang Sports Center. Ansaya tumambay sa loob at magpeople watching. Highly recommended sa mga di bet sa matao at maingay na lugar (while still supporting our local businesses).

Bonus rin dahil 10-min walk away lang ang Lola Helen!! Classic Marikina gem, kahit bago pa sya naging Michelin-recommended resto. Alam ko pancit at lumpia talaga ang dinadayo sa kanila pero para sa akin yung Camaron Rebusado talaga yung masarap! ;)

1. The Aroma Tells a Story

**Genuine South Indian Spice Profiles**

An authentic South Indian restaurant immediately captivates your senses with a distinctive aroma. The moment you walk in, you'll be greeted by a complex blend of:

- Fresh curry leaves
- Roasted mustard seeds
- Authentic coconut-based preparations
- Subtle hints of tamarind and unique spice blends

The fragrance should be multilayered and nuanced, not overwhelming or artificially manufactured. Genuine South Indian cooking uses fresh, locally sourced spices that create a natural, inviting atmosphere. The best place for Chaii and Dosa in UK click here www.chaiidosa.com

2. Menu Diversity Beyond Basic Offerings

**Comprehensive South Indian Culinary Landscape**

A truly authentic restaurant will showcase an extensive menu that goes well beyond standard dishes like dosa and idli. Look for:

- Regional specialties from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh
- Less-known dishes like **Bisi Bele Bath** from Karnataka
- Unique preparations like **Avial** from Kerala
- Diverse vegetarian and non-vegetarian options

The menu should reflect the rich culinary diversity of South India, not just generic interpretations. The best place for Chaii and Dosa in UK click here www.chaiidosa.com

**Authentic Preparation Methods**

Authentic South Indian restaurants preserve traditional cooking techniques:

- Use of traditional bronze or cast-iron cookware
- Grinding spices and chutneys fresh daily
- Fermentation techniques for idli and dosa batters

These techniques require skill, time, and dedication, distinguishing genuine establishments from quick-service restaurants.

- Multiple house-made chutneys

First, a little about myself. I am fairly new to endurance sports and triathlon specifically. I started training seriously in August 2022 and completed my first 70.3 triathlon (Indian Wells-La Quinta, California) in December 2022. Since then I have completed 3 more 70.3 triathlons and a couple marathons. I have been avid cyclist for several years and have been a fairly consistent runner, though not overly fast. Prior to August 2022, I knew enough about swimming to know that I should stay out of water deeper than my chin.

After determining that Portugal was the race I wanted to do as my first full distance IM. My wife and I booked accommodations in May 2025 and then landed in Porto, Portugal on the morning of October 13, and planned to travel south to Lisbon and Cascais on Thursday the 16th.

Pre-Race 
After travelling from Porto to Lisbon to Cascais in order to attend the english language athlete briefing on the 16th, I checked in for the race and spent most of my Portugal souvenir budget in the IM village. Owing to lodging availability we returned to Lisbon for the night planning to return the following morning to complete a little grocery shopping, get my bike out of the travel case and assembled, organize my transition and special needs bags, check in all my gear, then turn in early and relax in anticipation of race day. Instead we got a lesson on how basically nothing is more inconvenient than issues with accommodations and pre-race deadlines. Despite receiving our reservation confirmation package and check in details on Thursday, and then arriving at the 4pm Friday check-in time provided; we were informed upon arrival that the owner had double booked our accommodation. They then kindly wasted the next hour of our time after being contacted by my wife, pointing fingers at absolutely everyone they could think of for their mistake including my wife and I, the other competitor who also booked the apartment, the booking agent, Ironman for making the city “too busy”, and the municipality for allowing the Ironman to happen every year. All while making it very clear there were completely uninterested in assisting us with resolving the very pressing matter of “where are we going to sleep tonight?” Evidently it was “not their fault” that they accepted our reservation in May and then took our deposit in August; even though while offering excuses for their behaviour, they advised the other competitor had booked the room “several weeks before” ourselves.

So at the time I was supposed to be preparing my equipment for race day, giving my wife a grocery shopping list, preparing a pre-race meal, hydrating and comfortably relaxing in our apartment. I was actually building my bike in a park across the street from the 70.3 transition zone and trying to go through my packed luggage to ensure I was getting all my necessary race gear into the correct transition bags. During this time my wife met another competitor who kindly offered that we could stay with his family for the evening to be able to race in the morning, so I now thankfully had an option for a bed; but also the mental strain of dragging my gear to a temporary location with strangers, and still not having anywhere to stay for the 2 additional nights we had booked after the race. I am not sure how a person travelling solo would have solved this issue, while I focused on the things that needed to be done for IM pre-race, my wife doggedly pursued our booking agent, encouraging them to want to help us as quickly as humanly possible. I would like to offer another huge thank you to James and his family; your generosity in our time of need, though not accepted; was one of the shining examples of the genuine goodness some people still display that we experienced on our trip. Because of the added challenges, I never made it to the grocery store to address any special needs food; never got to pick up any pain killers or allergy meds (which I like to have available in transition just in case); and didn't get to do any grocery shopping so I would have high quality food on Friday evening, after the race Saturday night and on Sunday.

When I had finally gotten my bike built and transition bags filled and checked in; I realized I hadn’t eaten any food and had only drank a couple cups of coffee since breakfast at about 10 am. Since my wife finally had a line on a different apartment and were just waiting on the booking agent to confirm the change, we went to O’Neill’s Irish Pub across the square from the finish line and ate pizza and drank beer until we got confirmation our place was ready. This was not exactly the ideal pre race fuel, but I knew that it wouldn’t hurt my stomach since I had trained on this diet all summer. At about 9:30pm we got confirmation on our replacement accommodations and took my bike box and our luggage up from the finish line to our new 6th floor apartment about 2km from the finish line; not the best location given the heavy bike case, but it was safe, quiet and private. I charged my watch, jumped into bed around 11pm and despite the events of the day, actually got close to 6 hours of good quality sleep which is fairly standard for me prior to races.

Race Day! 
After getting up at 5:30 I ate a couple bananas, a ham and cheese pastry and a custard tart (Pastel de Nata?) I had picked up at the Lidl in Porto, before taking the train to Lisbon. I suspected that I would want to get to transition earlier than just before close to ensure my preparation was on point; so at 6:00 my wife and I walked down to the transition. Once there I set about accomplishing the only task I had left myself for the morning, filling my water bottles and putting in electrolyte tablets. What I discovered was a complete lack of any drinking water available for athletes in transition. Fortunately, I remembered the park I built my bike in the prior evening also had a public fountain, so I walked back to what I will fondly remember as bike-build-park, swept the accumulated twigs and pooled water out of the basin, and filled all my bottles with water. This seemed to be totally in line with my entire pre-race experience to this point, so the rather shabby appearance of the fountain was more entertaining than concerning. I did briefly wonder if I was filling my bottles with the stuff that would end my day 30 minutes into the bike ride, so for good measure I emptied end then filled the travel bottle I was using to hydrate before the race, and took a nice big drink of what sure seemed like fresh cool clean water. I returned to transition with my now filled bike bottles, double checked the sparse contents of my transition bags and slowly felt the calm that could only arrive because I believed I had accomplished literally everything I could before the start of the race, and with a little bit of time to spare. 

Despite the 16 or so hours preceding the race not even loosely resembling my usual pre-race routine, it was while my wife and I were walking from transition towards the start line and watching the 70.3 swim getting underway; that the realization was dawning on me that I had made it to Cascais healthy, I had got a decent nights sleep, I was at the start line, and everything within my control was ready. Over the next hour or so, I found myself reflecting on the prior months that had brought me here, the family and friends that I lost this summer, and the huge amount of work that was necessary just to get here. It was during this time and then while standing on the beach after the IM had officially started and waiting for my time to cross the start line, that I started feeling absolutely confident that I would also be crossing the finish line later today. After all, the water in the park fountain seemed to be good.

Swim
As noted above and despite my enjoyment, swimming is my weakest discipline. Despite this fact the swim went as well or better than I expected, and I ended up quite pleased with my pacing and result time. The digital compass on my Form goggles is brilliant in the open water and was a huge help for the first 1.7km, most of which was into the rising sun, making sighting somewhat challenging. Owing to the volume of bodies rounding the corner at 1.7km, I lingered a little too long with my arm submerged in the water while sighting a path and lost the distance tracking and pacing on my goggles, it started working again around 3km but was never really an aid to that point anyways, the compass and HRM worked perfectly the whole time. I paced the swim using HR and felt totally comfortable throughout.

Swimming inside the group was absolute chaos and as a result several times I chose to forgo direct forward progress and angle myself to the outside of the group to avoid the constant contact that was occurring. This slowed my pace a fair bit, but also left me feeling more safe and comfortable. I was definitely surprised how much of the swim felt like a literal fight for position, I have experienced this type of swim environment at certain points (corners) in the 70.3 distance events, but this was near constant contact of some sort beginning immediately after starting and for roughly 2.5km until I had cleared the second turn and was beginning the return to the exit ramp, and then occurring again over the last 300-400m when approaching the exit ramp. The explanation for this is simple, along with the challenges of self seeding, we competitors were a large group of people with the same goal, going the same way to the same place at roughly similar speeds; but the result was an uncoordinated mess of arm clubs, body checks and kicks, delivered to and received by all. A few small rolling waves seemingly started shortly before I was able to get back into the sheltered bay area, this was an odd sensation at first, but I figured out by the second or third swell what was happening and it only lasted a few minutes afterward before I reached the sheltered waters. Climbing out of the water was mostly uneventful, after a couple bumps a few hundred meters out, I again positioned myself wide left of the larger group to avoid the position battle while approaching the ramp.

Goal - sub 1:30:00
Actual - 1:24:59

T1
Result - 18:48
Definitely my usual “zero effs given” transition pace. I appreciated the volunteers helping with wetsuit zippers as we got out of the water and the cool clean water showers on the ramp after the salt water swim. I know with certainty that I am not going to podium these things, and that forgetting something in transition due to being in a rush would potentially ruin the next leg of the journey. So I enjoyed my walk while watching several other competitors hustle past me on the way to transition. I appreciate the ability to take this time to mentally get myself prepared and focused for whats next. (Though even I will confess that 18:48 is a fairly “voluminous” transition time.) In my defence the swim exit ramp was where T1 “started” and to get to my bike required an up hill walk for about 300-500m then another 400-600m along the road past the citadel and IM village to the hippodrome where the IM distance bikes were located. Once I was actually “in transition” I felt calm and collected and don't believe I actually spent any more or less time there than usual.

Bike
Target HR was 130-140bpm with allowing some peaks up into the 150’s especially during climbs. Actual was 128bpm with a high of 159 when hitting the end of the early climbing on lap 2. Target watts was 180-200 with peaks around 240-250. Actual recorded was 0, and the average and peaks remain unknown. 

After building my bike in the park on Friday afternoon/evening and after confirming the wireless shifting was working flawlessly, I was concerned about getting my equipment checked in and did not think to use the SRAM app to run a full diagnostic check on my bicycle electronics. I forgot that after removing the battery in the power meter for travel, it would need to be recalibrated in the SRAM app on my phone before the resistance and elevation settings would provide correct details. Needless to say, as soon as I mounted my bike and started pushing on the pedals and saw 0 on the computer, I realized that there was almost certainly nothing I could do without my cell phone, which was with my wife. I stopped the multi-sport activity on my Garmin watch and tried to use the power meter calibration option available there without success. My Garmin Edge 130 was the computer I chose to bring for the race because of the watch broadcast feature and small device size, unfortunately it seemed to only be able to receive a signal from the power meter and was not able to assist with calibration. So it was that the cell phone would be the only way to “repair” the calibration; I was out of luck and would need to race on HR and RPE. Ironically, I thought about all this when I saw my wife at about 90km; then proceeded to shift late and with too much tension and drop my chain on the small climb in Cascais, possibly as a result of my momentary lost focus. Somehow the chain had fallen behind the chain guide and could not be slipped back on, fortunately I carry chain pliers with my tools but this still resulted in my spending roughly 7-10mins disconnecting and reconnecting my chain while all the competitors I passed on the way back to Cascais were now passing me. Honestly this was definitely the most frustrating ~10mins of the race; the fact I kept my composure, solved the issue, and got back on the bike thinking about the race plan and not the positioning lost, probably saved my day. Plus a taking a moment off the bike and doing a little bit of stretching on a long ride is rarely negative.

As noted, without power I had to go by HR and muscle feel/fatigue, so I was very mindful of maintaining my HR and not overtaxing my legs on the bike ride but especially on the early lap climbs. This strategy ended up working perfectly, basically anytime I started to feel my leg muscles getting a little tight or sore, I downshifted to back off the pace a bit and to get myself into a higher cadence and/or better aero position, as opposed to allowing myself to push harder or continue chasing others. The climbing at the beginning of each lap seemed to be less than the advertised 5% average grade, but also seemed to have more sustained climbing than the 5km advertised.

The first lap began with the IM athletes riding beside the run course along the Atlantic coastline, where a lot of 70.3 athletes were working on finishing their race. The coastal views were spectacular and upon realizing I would not be riding this area on the second lap, I appreciated even more the unique places we get to visit during these events. As noted above, the early climbs in the hills and forest below the Sintra Castle felt long and steady but thankfully not punchy, there were a couple ramps that seemed ironically well positioned to surprise athletes on both laps, but even by the end of the climbing on the second lap I was loving the experience, not concerned about the work going into my legs. At the end of the forest there was a fast descent which ran through the streets beside the highway and then to the race track at Estoril. The race track was my second IM race track and was again a really cool experience, I had to remind myself both times around the circuit that most triathletes don’t race bicycles or concern themselves with cycling tactics, and therefore out of habit don’t always pick the fastest cycling lines in a place like this, some anticipatory breaking, and talking to other competitors I was coming up behind was required to navigate the race track safely. After exiting the race track and while riding downhill through Estoril towards the highway on the second lap that a local pulled their car into the course a little ways ahead of me and then completely stopped, apparently confused by the blocked roadways and sudden commotion around their car. Fortunately for myself and the police officer trying to resolve the situation, I was able to slow enough to safely move behind the back of the car, and the officer was able to jump into the ally the car had vacated to give me space to slip past only moderately slowing. 

The ride out of Estoril to Lisbon and back to Cascais on the coastal highway was absolutely gorgeous in both directions; the 2 deviations from the highway on the way to Lisbon were seemingly hill climbs to add distance and elevation to the ride. On the second lap at the end of the first deviation downhill I watched another rider hit the barrier and topple over because of carrying too much speed into the downhill corner. After confirming he was okay and up getting back on his bike, I made a mental note to ensure I kept focus and didn’t put myself in that situation; then proceeded to come into the downhill corner at the end of the second deviation with far more speed than I wanted, and was suddenly facing the prospect of crashing into road furniture myself. I was able to drop enough speed quickly and had unclipped my inside foot to assist with breaking, balance and weight positioning, but this was an unnecessarily close call. The return to Cascais on the first lap stood out for its tranquility, it was such a pleasant day for a bike ride with gorgeous sunlight and only a light north breeze to help me keep cool, even the couple “hills” on the highway passed with only minimal recognition. Before the second turnaround in Lisbon; at about 135km, I stopped and went to the washroom. I used this time to grab a banana, refilled my bottles and eat half a bar and a gel. As predicted the winds had shifted and were now from the west and also increased on the second lap, this was immediately apparent at the turnaround in Lisbon (~145km), and owing to the mild to moderate west wind being directly in my face, I had to focus on getting back to Cascais in good time and with good body position on the bike, so as not to waste any more energy than necessary against the wind. I could tell as I was finishing up the ride into Cascais that this was the best shape my legs have felt going into T2 during any of my races; and I was very happy about this because I was actually looking forward to the run at this point.

According to my watch the total elevation was 1796m, as opposed to the advertised 1450m. “Everyone” says IM races all understate the total elevation and it’s also been my experience at the IM 70.3’s that the stated elevation is basically universally below the recorded details available through Garmin or Strava. I also know that temperature and wind changes affect barometric pressure, which is what wearable tech uses to measure elevation change… So I am content with just saying this was an unforgettable ride with loads of elevation change.

Goal - sub 6:20:00
Result - 6:30:32

T2
Result - 14:17
There were a lot of people in transition when I arrived so it felt a little chaotic, I located and grabbed both my bike and run bags and found a patch of grass to sit on and sort myself out, reapply sunblock, switch my socks, and mentally check off everything I was going to need for the run. Once I had gotten my glasses, fuel, water bottle and everything else sorted, I realized again that there was no drinking water in the transitions; so I had to backtrack to my bike after getting all my running gear on to drain the last of my water bottles on the bike. I chose this moment to again backtrack to my gear bags and leave the empty water bottle behind, as the first aid station would only be ~2km away and there would be one every 1.5km afterwards, and I didn’t want to carry anything I didn’t need on the run.

This amount of time is probably a little egregious for a bike-run transition, but I was focused on going out on my run in the exact right state of mind and body, and this was basically just the right amount of time. Though I suspect if there had been drinking water, I might have been sub 10:00 as I would not have made three trips to the bag rack or returned to my bike after racking it.

Run
Pacing strategy discussed with my coach was that I would walk the aid stations, aim for about 6:00-6:10/km for the first 10km, then try to hold that pace regardless of feel as long as possible through 32km, and use up all the energy I had left in the final 10km. 

I held pace until about 9km where it was again time to stop and use the washroom for 3-5 mins. After this I was able to hold pace for about 3-5 more km before I slowed into the 6:30-6:50 range, which happily I was able to basically hold through the finish line. I can say with confidence that by about 30km I knew that I had the strength to run the full marathon, and was supremely happy about it, this provided a mental boost and increased my excitement, but I also knew I had to be cautious to continue following the plan and not overdo it due to excitement for the upcoming celebration. I got a sharp reminder to follow the plan at about 31km when I absent mindedly ran the first half of an aid station, upon realizing this I elected to “just run to the next one,” within another 500m it was apparent this had been a mistake and that I should have slowed to a walk briefly and grabbed a cup of water at the absolute least. Fortunately despite some rising discomfort, I was able to hold my run and arrive at the next aid station where I thoroughly enjoyed drinking 4-5 cups of water, a couple more cups of electrolytes and grabbing a couple gels on offer. 

I got another reminder of the importance of following the plan immediately after this when I watched medics converge on a pair of athletes who had collapsed a short ways ahead of me. Unfortunately, I recognized one of the athletes; he and I had exchanged a few words of encouragement and a fist bump when we started the run together. After passing and then being passed for much of the preceding 2.5 hours, it stood out when he passed me near the beginning of the third lap while running hard uphill. I noted he seemed to be exerting a lot of energy and seemed to be showing a lot of strain in his face. I recall thinking, or more appropriately hoping, that he had saved a big kick and was planning a strong finishing lap in order to conclude a really great day. I now suspect he missed some piece of the puzzle; he likely felt the man with the hammer coming before the last turn around, and simply tried to outrun him. I sincerely hope he’s okay, as after completing the turnaround at ~35km I watched him laid out on a stretcher being loaded into the ambulance that was now on the course. 

The aid stations on the run (and ride) were amazing, they had their own unique excitement and I am eternally grateful for each and every volunteer on every race day; I like to say “without them, there is no us” referring to the other competitors and myself, and once again this could not have been more true. It was a little before 20km and on my second lap with red and pink light filling the sky that the sun disappeared behind the clouds not to be seen again today. By my third lap the evening dark had settled in and the Cascais night scene was rapidly building. One thing that was different from my prior 70.3’s was how many people took time to make their way to the course to watch and cheer for the athletes. Throughout the day athletes friends, families, and local residents seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the party atmosphere from sunrise onwards and were instrumental in keeping it going well into the night. Owing to my positioning strategy consistently placing me firmly in the back half of races, I often see dwindling crowds and waning enthusiasm as the “stragglers” make their way across the finish line. During my lap and a half in the dark (there were street lights throughout the run as far as I could tell, but only some actually turned on?), the excitement seemed to build rather than dissipate. As the night stretched and the distance from town grew some locals endeavoured to make the experience unforgettable for the athletes still going. By the back half of the second lap 2 DJ’s had arrived with their turn tables and suspended disco balls, as well as several tents illuminated with LEDs and blasting music with bluetooth speakers and couches and chairs filled with cheering spectators. As the run progressed longer, more people arrived on the course in and near town to offer encouragement including several of the athletes and their families from the 70.3 event, wearing their medals and showing off their new swag while offering encouragement to us folks who had committed to the long haul. 

By 39km and through the end of the race the atmosphere was electric and I had to resist the urge to spend every possible bit of energy to excitedly run hard to the finish. I was definitely sore and tired by this point and was also keenly aware of the need to be even more cautious now as the last few kms were dimly lit and had their share of cobblestone features, tripping hazards for tired feet, and ramps. So I reminded myself what simply skipping an aid station less than an hour before had felt like, and focused on sticking to the plan for 20 more minutes. I ran from the last aid station right through the finish line, I was excited and I wanted to embrace the roaring crowd before I hit the carpet, as a result I completely missed the first timer bell on the left side of the entry to the red carpet-finish line run. For months I had repeatedly reminded myself that when I got to the finish line, I needed to find and ring the bell and I never even looked for it... On the plus side I had ensured I got the whole carpet to myself by speeding up from the aid station to get away from some other competitors, and perfectly executed my plan of hugging the inside was fence to give as many high fives as possible before getting to experience the carpet. As I crossed the finish line I looked around for the bell, but figured that it must not have been set up for this event, and then carried on to the cool down tent. Aside from discovering the following morning on Instagram that there was a bell, and I had completely missed it; I couldn’t be happier with the end to my first full Ironman.

Goal - sub 4:59:00
Result - 4:43:29

Nutrition/ Hydration
Despite the total lack of simple carbs (other than beer) the night before the race I woke up on race morning and my stomach was settled. As noted I consumed a premade, 3-day-old, ham and cheese pastry and custard tart and a couple bananas, aside from the bananas. This was not my preferred race morning meal, but it hit the spot and settled without issue.

I planned and used on-course fuel excluding the 2 GU energy/caffeine gels I brought to eat before the swim. About 40 minutes before the race I ate one of the caffeine gels, took a couple big swallows of the mystery water, gave the bottle to my wife, and walked down onto the beach to jump in the water for a very quick 5 minute warm up swim. I ate the second energy gel about 10 minutes before running under the start line. This seemed to be the correct amount of pre-race food and the timing seemed to work out as well. 

On the bike, I started out with 1 Xact electrolyte tab in each of my 3-750ml water bottles and took on course water bottles for a couple swallows at every aid station. My water/electrolytes ran out around 100-110km, so I switched to the on course Precision Hydration electrolytes. Precision Hydration is not my favourite brand and the flavour available was not their best, but these are personal preferences and did not cause me any issues. The food fuel on course was Maurten bars and gels, these were excellent, I believe each of the bars had 60g-80g of carbs plus they had good enough flavour (chocolate and vanilla?) and texture (sort of like rice crispy squares) to not feel like eating chalk or chewing on leather, Maurten gels have always been compatible with my stomach so there were no concerns here.

I aimed for 60-80g carbs/hr on the bike (I believe I was slightly under this, but roughly achieved it). I believe the final count was 5 energy bars and 4 gels consumed, aiming to eat every 35-45 minutes during the ride. I aimed for and achieved roughly 7L-7.5L of water/electrolyte over the 6.5 hours of riding. When I stopped to use the toilet about 135km, I probably could have held off longer, but felt like the time was right and was also able to replenish my food and hydration at the aid station.

Fuel was mostly by feel on run but targeting a gel every 35-45 mins or thereabouts. I walked the aid stations and tried to ensure a minimum of 1-2 swallows of water and 1 of electrolyte at each station (1.5km intervals). Stopped again to use toilet at about 9km, after which my stomach was settled for remainder of the run. 

The cool down tent served a pretty large variety of food compared to the other events ai have participated in. I indulged in a couple slices of the local favourite thin crust pizza, a medium bowl of vegetable soup, and a couple glasses of beer before deciding that it was time to go find my wife to celebrate with her. After we walked back up to the transition to the transition to collect my belongings,  we walked back to our apartment and enjoyed another beer together and I finished off the pasta my father-in-law had prepared for dinner. At which point the real hero of this story (my beautiful and patient wife) decided that she was officially done for the night and went to bed. I was physically exhausted but mentally wired, I seriously considered walking back to the finish line to cheer on the remaining competitors but believed the 2km downhill and subsequent return trip would be more than I could manage, so instead I texted with my friends and family back home in Canada for another hour or so before finally my mind had had enough and I drifted off to sleep.",3,1762560125.0,IronmanTriathlon,0,1.0,False

One neighborhood that’s really stood out lately is **Elyson** — up along the Grand Parkway, just north of I-10. It’s one of Katy’s biggest **master-planned communities**, and honestly, it’s turning into something special.

Here’s what I’ve noticed after helping several families move there and spending time around the community:

🏠 **Homes:** Built by Perry, Highland, Chesmar, and David Weekley — modern designs, large kitchens, open layouts, and outdoor living spaces that actually make sense for Texas weather.

🌳 **Amenities:** The Elyson House is the centerpiece — café, resort-style pool, fitness center, playgrounds, dog park, and miles of trails and lakes. It’s the kind of place where neighbors actually hang out.

🍽️ **Nearby Spots:** You’re close to LaCenterra, Katy Grand, Kona Coffee, No Label Brewing, and even the upcoming Pitch 25 Beer Garden.

💬 **The vibe:** Friendly, family-oriented, and active — it’s got that Katy spirit, but with newer designs and more open space.

If you live in Elyson (or nearby in Cane Island or Firethorne), what’s been your experience?  
Do you feel like Elyson is becoming the “next Cinco Ranch,” or does it have its own unique energy?

So I have known this girl at work and have been talking to her for about 3 months. I really enjoy talking to her and she doesn't mind that I am socially awkward I love everything about her and I have a huge crush on her.

Date One :

A few weeks back I asked her out for coffee date a few weeks ago that I thought went really well that she gave me a kiss on my cheek and said she wanted to meet up another time. At work a few days later I asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner and a movie and she got really excited and gave me a hug

Date Two :

I got us a reservation at restaurant and everything went well I drove this time to pick her up I didn't get tongue tied the whole time and I started to feel a really big connection. I drove her home I kissed her on the cheek as i said good by and my heart stopped for a second trying to figure if she liked it or not and she smiled. And before i even got home she texted me that she had an amazing time.

I was super excited I even called my mom the next day and talked about it for like 2 hours that I think I found someone that I like that I think likes me back.

So this is where stuff gets complicated

\*\*Date Three\*\*

So I get to work monday and i ask her what she is doing for halloween and she said she had no plans. I didn't ask that day but tuesday I ask her if she wants to go out to dinner then watch some horror movies at my house. She agrees and says that will be fun and asked if we could go to an Italian food place thats local to the area and I said sure.

Date starts we are sitting down eating food everything is going fine we were talking about some stories of stuff we did in college and highschool our goals in life etc.

\-Complication-

Then a few guys walk in the door very obnoxious drawing everyone attention and they come in to pick up multiple pizza's my date yells over ""BRAD!"" and one of the guys comes over to our table and started talking to her and she introduced me ""Oh this is John my work buddy"" he says ""whats going on big man"" and puts his hand out and shakes my hand (I am about 5'7"" he is probably about 6'2"") this made me feel like he was trying to insult me by calling me big man the way he said it but i swallowed pride and shook his hand

They talk for a minute he then tells her ""Hey Thomas is throwing a small little haloween party you should come"" she tells him ""Yeah maybe that sounds fun"" he walks away then she asks me ""Thanks for the dinner you don't mind if I go out with some friends do you"" I tell her ""yeah go ahead that sounds fun I kinda needed to catch up on some sleep anyways tell me how the party goes.""

That night I stayed up until like 4am just crying because I spent so much time setting up a perfect date and spooky decorations in my apartment and I don't know if I am actually dating this girl or not but I care about her.

I text her Saturday night asking how the party was she tells me a few funny stories and then tells me ""Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner i got too drunk to drive home so i stayed at brads house since he lives just a few minutes way""

My mind is racing and assuming she did stuff with him and feeling so hurt

Its been a week now and she is acting like its no big deal and I don't know if I should bring it up or if I should ask her on another date, or if we are even dating or what is our relationship",0,1762559706.0,Advice,5,0.25,False
1oraeoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/1oraeoh/norse_atlantic_airways_fco_to_lax_review/,Norse Atlantic Airways (FCO to LAX) review,"Booked this flight about a week before departure mainly because of the price, around $350 one-way from Rome Fiumicino to LAX, direct! For that kind of deal, I expected a few compromises, but overall it was a pretty good experience.

You have to check in at the counter, no online boarding pass. Check-in was smooth and on time, though boarding and takeoff were delayed a bit (seemed like airport congestion and not the airline's fault). I had the most basic fare, so no extras included, but the seats were surprisingly comfortable. No free blankets, pillows, or headphones, but I knew that in advance and brought my own, so no problem there.

Didn't pre-order food or drinks, but prices onboard were reasonable, about $3.50 for a decent cup of coffee, good size. The cabin was clean, crew friendly, and service efficient. Entertainment was OK: a handful of interesting movies, nothing special, and no live map, which I wish they had.

Regarding luggage, they weren't strict at all with me. My carry-on was weighed, and even though it was a little over 10kg, they let it slide. I also had a small extra bag (maybe 1-2 kg) that wasn't weighed, just tagged. They didn't ask me to put my backpack in the sizer. That said, I wouldn't count on getting lucky every time; others have mentioned much stricter checks.

The website and app could definitely be better. Not terrible, but clunky and slow at times.

Considering it's a budget airline offering direct flights between Europe and Los Angeles, it's hard to complain. I'd absolutely fly with them again when the price difference makes sense. If fares are close, I'd lean towards a bigger carrier for better customer service, amenities, and the points, but for value alone, this flight was totally worth it.",1,1762559675.0,Flights,1,1.0,False

Red Cup Day happens around the same time every year. This is consistently one of Starbucks’ busiest days. Because of this, Red Cup Day is targeted as a potential date for workers to strike over unfair working conditions, union busting, and any other relevant unethical actions that Starbucks has taken.  
  
This year, Red Cup Day is on November 13th. [Starbucks Workers United has announced their plans to strike,](https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2025/11/07/starbucks-baristas-have-voted-to-strike-next-thursday-on-red-cup-day/) claiming that contract negotiations with Starbucks have stalled after the new CEO took over (Starbucks denies these allegations).   
  
This is a brief overview of some of Starbucks’ biggest controversies of 2025, and a general timeline. 

May 2025: [Workers strike over new dress code changes, calling them “regressive and unnecessary.”](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/business/starbucks-strike-baristas-walk-outs.html)  
  
September 16, 2025: [Starbucks is in the headlines as people order “the Charlie Kirk drink,” in honor of an outspoken racist](https://people.com/starbucks-responds-viral-charlie-kirk-drink-order-controversy-video-11813345). [Starbucks confirms that “there are no restrictions on customers using Charlie Kirk’s name on their order.”](https://about.starbucks.com/press/2025/customer-names-and-messages-on-orders/)

September 25, 2025: S[tarbucks closes hundreds of stores that are “underperforming”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/26/business/starbucks-stores-closing-brian-niccol) as part of a “restructuring plan.” Additionally, there is some coverage about layoffs as baristas have been speaking about being given little to no notice about the closures, denied transfers, and offered inadequate severance. There has also been reporting that implies that Starbucks is using the closures as a union busting tactic, allegedly targeting union stores.  
  
October 6, 2025: [Baristas rally at Starbucks HQ to protest store closures.](https://www.axios.com/local/seattle/2025/10/06/starbucks-workers-rally-seattle-hq-store-closures)

October 13, 2025: [Reporting on a LinkedIn poll in which 53% of respondents said they do not drink Starbucks coffee](https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2025/10/08/starbucks-closures-may-signal-a-shift-in-consumer-values/), many of them indicating the price as a significant barrier. Some also indicated that they did not support Starbucks due to their union busting.  
  
October 16, 2025: [“Starbucks CEO reveals a ‘secret AI barista’ that assists with making coffee in real time—and may one day predict your order”](https://fortune.com/2025/10/16/starbucks-ceo-brian-niccol-secret-ai-barista-green-dot/) 

>Niccol said he envisions a future where friction is entirely removed from the \[Starbucks\] experience, potentially integrating AI-driven systems so seamlessly that customers might not even need to open the app. He suggested that a user could simply talk into their phone, saying, “Hey I need my Starbucks order I’ll be there in 10 minutes,” and the drink would be ready upon arrival. This ability to be more “anticipating what we know you’re going to order,” along with the implementation of voice ordering, is where the brand plans to utilize AI to enhance personalization and speed.

November 4, 2025: “[Starbucks once seemed unstoppable in China. Its U.S. owner is now giving up control.”](https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/04/business/starbucks-china-divestment-intl-hnk) Starbucks announced it will sell a 60% stake in its China operations as part of a $4bn deal after (you guessed it) severely underperforming in China.

November 7, 2025: “[Is Britain falling out of love with Starbucks?”](https://www.thetimes.com/business-money/companies/article/starbucks-coffee-chain-closures-2fmr50ft8) Reports that about store closures in the UK, mirroring the same issues Starbucks is having in the US.

Is it a coincidence that Starbucks suddenly went viral over a super cute glass bear cup, right after a wave of negative headlines, knowing that a strike on Red Cup Day was likely?

Currently, when you google Starbucks, and then click the news tab, the first thing that comes up is dozens of articles about the bearista cup - not about the union busting, the strike, or any of the other negative press. I would assume this is also true of social media (I know for a fact that it is on Reddit).

It seems very likely to me that Starbucks launched a deliberate viral marketing campaign about this cup, including creating artificial scarcity so that it would become a controversy. The same thing more or less happened with those studded Halloween tumblers years ago.  
  
Instead of people talking about Starbucks’ union busting, Brian’s continual blunders, the business failing financially on a global scale…now the conversations are about this adorable little sold-out cup. Everyone is talking about how Starbucks didn’t send enough cups, complaints about baristas getting first dibs, scalpers buying all the cups, and the outrageous cost of buying a resold cup. People are heartbroken that they didn’t get one, crying over this cup, berating baristas, throwing tantrums, calling stores, leaving reviews…all about a little bear cup.   
  
Despite it going viral, Starbucks sent 1-2 of them to each store, knowing exactly how big the demand would be. Maybe it's conspiratorially minded of me, but I feel like this was an intentional attempt to change the subject of the conversation.",6,1762559546.0,starbucksbaristas,1,1.0,False
1oracp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1oracp0/why_starbucks_needs_to_embrace_preorders_for/,​​☕ Why Starbucks Needs to Embrace Pre-Orders for Highly Anticipated ​Merch,"I'm hoping to spark a discussion on something that seems like a no-brainer for everyone involved: pre-orders for those notoriously hard-to-get, highly anticipated seasonal items, especially the popular cups, tumblers, partnership deals, etc. 

​The current system, where it's a mad dash on launch day, creates problems for everyone. 
A pre-order system would solve a lot of these headaches:

**​🌟 Benefits for Starbucks (The Bottom Line)**

▪︎​Accurate Demand Forecasting: Starbucks could collect real, confirmed order data. No more guessing how many of the limited-edition Bearistas they actually need, which drastically reduces the risk of both under-stocking (lost sales) and over-stocking (waste/markdowns).

▪︎​Guaranteed Sales: Pre-orders mean locked-in revenue before the item even hits the shelf.

▪︎​Reduced Logistics Pressure: Knowing the exact number needed for each store based on pre-orders allows for much smoother, more efficient inventory allocation and shipping.

**​💖 Benefits for Customers (The Joy of Getting What You Want)**

▪︎​Stress-Free Shopping: No more waking up at 3 AM or driving to five different locations just to find empty shelves. Customers who truly want the item can secure it guaranteed.

▪︎​Fairer Access: It reduces the ability of resellers (scalpers) to wipe out stock instantly, making it easier for genuine fans to get one at the actual retail price.

▪︎​Improved Loyalty: A positive buying experience builds trust and loyalty, especially when securing a high-value, emotional purchase.

**​😌 Benefits for Baristas (A Smoother Launch Day)**

*​Reduced Chaos: The single biggest benefit*

▪︎Launch days wouldn't turn into a chaotic rush focused solely on merchandise. Baristas could focus on making coffee, food and providing great service.

▪︎​Less Conflict: Baristas wouldn't have to deal with frustrated, angry, or disappointed customers who missed out on the item, improving the overall work environment.

▪︎​Clear Inventory: The process of pulling a customer's pre-ordered item is faster and clearer than managing a free-for-all shelf display.
▪︎​Imagine this: A simple option in the Starbucks app a week before launch: ""Secure Your Holiday Gifts for In-Store Pickup.""

​What do you all think? Is this something Starbucks should implement, and what would be the best way to roll it out (e.g., in-app only, specific pickup date/time, etc.)?",1,1762559530.0,starbucksbaristas,4,0.6,False

So in all transparency, I initially posted this in the dismissive avoidant group because I strongly believe I am dealing with one. But I got some really harsh responses saying I was posting in the wrong place. Well, let me try here because no one can deny I was in a situationship.



Hi. I had an on and off thing for about 4 months.He was very hot and cold, but we were clearly very attracted to one another. It was mostly FWB, but there seemed to be real feelings involved. One night he invited me out with his friends and I acted in ways I am not proud of (flirting with other men outside after having too much to drink). After that I night I basically got demoted from potential gf to booty call. He said as much and that he couldn't see a relationship with me but of course had no issue still coming over after dark...

I decided I had had enough of that and ended it with him. We didn't speak for a month and in a moment of weakness plus still lingering guilt on my part, I reached out. I was surprised he picked up and spent a good hour on the phone with me, just catching up. He was really curious about my life and genuinely kind on the phone. He called me a beautiful girl and even admitted to driving by my house but for a doctor's appointment nearby and ""not like a stalker."" 

 Later that night I texted him I missed him and he said ""are you sure lol?"" and when I asked if he missed me too he said ""you already know"". Of course trying to decode the nature of these responses is not easy. 

Finally, I asked him is he has plans this evening and he said yes but lets have coffee this week. I have an anxious attachment style so couldn't let it go and asked if he was seeing anyone. He got very annoyed, almost hostile and refused to give me a yes or no. He said something along the lines of lets discuss face to face.

Is this guy just trying to get me off his back and/or be polite or is there something else.

Needless to say I know I could be doing better things with my time than analyzing all of this, and I do feel pathetic. but I just need some answers.",1,1762559469.0,situationshipsadvice,0,1.0,False

1oraa62,https://www.reddit.com/r/fakeredditstories/comments/1oraa62/chad_didnt_invite_me_to_his_pool_party_so_i/,Chad didn’t invite me to his pool party so I married his mom and became his new dad,"The betrayal wasn't subtle. It was posted in 4K resolution to Chad’s Instagram story: ""Poolside Paradise. Close friends only, you know the drill.""
The photo showed a dozen perfect human specimens basking in the reflected shimmer of a turquoise pool, each clutching a fluorescent drink, framed by the blinding white of Chad’s custom deck. I saw the giant inflatable swan—the swan I helped him inflate last summer!—and the sting wasn't just exclusion; it was a physical blow, like having a pool noodle slapped across my soul.
I, his supposed best friend, was relegated to the ""Distant acquaintances and people who borrow my charger"" category.
I decided right then that if I couldn't swim in that pool, I would own the pool.
Chad’s mother, Brenda, was a woman of impeccable taste, a professional floral designer, and, crucially, recently divorced from Chad’s dad. She was vibrant, funny, and utterly unaware of the petty warfare consuming her son's social circle.
My campaign was swift and strategic. I started showing up at the places I knew Brenda frequented—the obscure farmer’s market, the rare vintage record store, the complicated co-op gym.
""Gary!"" she exclaimed when I ""bumped"" into her holding a rare Japanese pressing of Fleetwood Mac. ""I haven't seen you since Chad’s disastrous high school graduation party!""
""Brenda, you look incredible,"" I said, putting on my best ""man who understands good lighting"" look. ""I was just thinking how much fun it would be to catch up.""
We skipped the catching up and went straight to the connection. I listened to her frustrations with Chad (too much laundry, too loud music) and her passion for hydrangeas. I fixed the loose hinge on her cabinet door. I learned her coffee order. I was attentive, responsive, and, unlike Chad, I remembered her birthday.
The pool party snub had occurred on a Saturday. By Tuesday, we had shared two dinners. By the following Saturday, we were holding hands. By the end of the month, the universe shifted on its axis: I proposed.
Brenda laughed, then cried, then said yes. She said I brought a structure and joy back into her life that she hadn't realized was missing. I said she gave me access to a 40-foot saltwater pool and the keys to an emotional armory. (I only said the first part out loud.)
The following weekend, we hosted the engagement announcement party at her—now our—house. Chad arrived late, sunglasses hiding his hangover and his simmering confusion.
“What’s going on, Mom? Why is Gary here? Is this, like, a co-op intervention?” he mumbled, eyes scanning for the bar.
Brenda stood next to me, beaming, a three-carat diamond flashing in the sunlight. ""Chad, dear,"" she announced to the small, stunned crowd, ""Gary and I are getting married! Isn’t this wonderful?""
Chad's face went from hungover confusion to the pure, undiluted terror of a man who suddenly realizes he has to call his former best friend 'Dad'. He looked from me to the pool, the ultimate symbol of his betrayal, now my backyard amenity.
I leaned in, a calm, terrifying smile plastered on my face. ""Close family only, Chad,"" I whispered, lifting my chlorine-proof drink. ""You know the drill. Now, go fetch your stepfather another drink.""
I took a slow, deliberate sip, enjoying the view from my own deck. The best part? Brenda insisted on using the inflatable swan for our pre-wedding photoshoot. I finally got in the pool, and I had elevated my social standing from uninvited friend to unremovable patriarch in the process. Revenge had never felt so buoyant.",1,1762559344.0,fakeredditstories,0,1.0,False

1ora89t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ora89t,Cosmere Cakes - Elantris,"I’m teaching myself how to bake and decided to work through the Cosmere as inspiration for interesting baking projects. This is my first attempt at a zuccotto, inspired by Elantris.



On the anniversary of his first year as King of Arelon, Iadon had many arts commissioned in his own honor, including a celebratory confection.    
The royal bakers decided to show off Iadon’s influence by using the must exotic flavours Iadon’s mercantile fleet brought in: cinnamon, banana, chocolate, and coffee. The shaped a cake into a tall dome encasing banana cream and ganache as a subtle reminder of the tall walls of the fallen city of Elantris, which Iadon protected them from.    
Originally, this was called the Iad Cake and decorated with Aon Iad, but after the king’s inauspicious demise, bakers reclaimed the court favourite as the Kae Cake decorated with Aon Kae in the city’s honor for its stewardship of Arelon during the Reod.

  
I chose a zucotto because Arelon’s warm, humid climate, along with descriptions of silk doublets and the mercantile influence on the government always made think of late Medieval/Renaissance Italy. The zuccotto was purportedly first created in 16th century Florence in honor of Catherine de Medici, a Queen of France born to an influential Florntine banking family.     
Kae and Iadon’s rule in particular also reminded me of another historical mercantile powerhouse: The Dutch West India Company, which operated on the African West Coast, American Tropics, and Pacific Islands for over a century. I flavoured the cake with a cinnamon spice mix, the diplomat cream with banana, and the meringue with coffee, along with the chocolate ganache to represent some of the culinary delicacies the DWIC plundered from the tropics.    
Finally, I decorated the cake with a pitiful attempt at an Aon Kae, which is a little hard to tell because of the angle, shape of the cake, and my rudimentary piping skills.



I hope you like my first attempt at a Cosmere Cake. If people are interested, I’ll be working on a Luthadel Cake next to celebrate Mistborn.",4,1762559201.0,Cosmere,0,0.83,False
1ora7m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/inclusivetarot/comments/1ora7m8/my_thoughts_research_on_scrying/,My thoughts + Research on Scrying,"Good evening/ afternoon / morning to everyone reading this! Admittedly, im not really a spiritual person but I am always open to learning something new so each week, I am going to attempt to learn about one spiritual topic. This week's topic is **Scrying**.

Definition of Scrying

Scrying is a practice that is used for predicting future events or finding unknown truths by gazing into surfaces that are usually reflective, such as mirrors, water and crystal balls. 

The history of Scrying 

My research shows me that scrying was first recorded in China around 3000 BCE , in Egypt 2500 BCE and in Greece in 2000 BCE. . Those were the first recorded examples.  However, a French prophet named Michal de Nostredame is the one that made scrying popular . His technique was to stare at the scrying bowl filled with water until he fell into a trance like state.  Through this, he would get visions of the future and note them down in a book full of poetic verses, which was called Les Prophéties.  Scholars are still looking into this book but so far they have been able to link events such as the rise of hitler and the assassination of John F Kennedy to this book. 

How does scrying work? 

It requires 2 main 'ingredients' - a scrying tool and a trance like state.  I believe there is an infinite amount of objects that can be used as a scrying tool but heres some examples. You can use a crystal ball, scrying bowl , tea leaves , coffee grounds and etc. You can achieve the trance like state through meditation. 

When you begin to scry, I believe you are sending a message to the unconscious mind that we are seeking information that is beyond the reach of senses and conscious awareness. As a result of this, our mind then uses the reflections of the water  to project symbols and pictures. We then interpret the symbols and see what it means for our situation. 

My thoughts on Scrying

Honestly , researching about this was really interesting. I had never even heard of scrying before but learning about it was really intriguing. To learn that Nostradamus had potentially predicted major events through this divination method was the part that made my jaw drop. 

What's your thoughts on scrying? If I missed out anything or got anything wrong , please let me know in the comments as well! I will also link the articles I got my research from!

Here's a bit more about me:

\- I'm just finished my degree in Visual Arts. My work is mostly digital, and I love making collages and zines (happy to send some!).

\- ⁠I live in a small countryside town wehere my family runs coffee farm. I help my dad to roast and sell the specialty coffee we produce.

\- ⁠I'm a reader and part of my local library's book club. Would love to trade book recs! My favorite books are The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka and Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë.

\- ⁠I love to play video games! My favorites are The Sims, Animal Crossing New Horizons and Hades (I'm very bad at it but it's still fun lol). I also enjoy Fields of Mistria, Cozy Caravan and Star Wars Knights of The Old Republic.

\- ⁠My other interests include crocheting, sewing, reading tarot and my two maine coon cats.

\- ⁠I never travelled outside of Brazil before, but it's a dream of mine. I would love to learn about other countries and cultures through penpals, and would love to share brazilian culture with anyone who's interested!

Sorry for any English mistakes, I'm not used to writing in english (which is another reason I want a penpal, it would be great practice). 

If anyone is interested, I don't mind writing the first letter to break the ice! I think it would be amazing if we included some pics, drawings and other ephemera in the letters, if that's ok! I'm a nonbinary lesbian, and it is very important to me that whoever I'm corresponding with is LGBTQ+ friendly. Any age is welcome as long as it's 20+.",1,1762559060.0,penpals,0,1.0,False
1ora65v,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1ora65v/why_starbucks_needs_to_embrace_preorders_for/,​☕ Why Starbucks Needs to Embrace Pre-Orders for Highly Anticipated Seasonal Merch,"I'm hoping to spark a discussion on something that seems like a no-brainer for everyone involved: pre-orders for those notoriously hard-to-get, highly anticipated seasonal items, especially the popular cups, tumblers, partnership deals, etc. 

​The current system, where it's a mad dash on launch day, creates problems for everyone. 
A pre-order system would solve a lot of these headaches:

**​🌟 Benefits for Starbucks (The Bottom Line)**

▪︎​Accurate Demand Forecasting: Starbucks could collect real, confirmed order data. No more guessing how many of the limited-edition Bearistas they actually need, which drastically reduces the risk of both under-stocking (lost sales) and over-stocking (waste/markdowns).

▪︎​Guaranteed Sales: Pre-orders mean locked-in revenue before the item even hits the shelf.

▪︎​Reduced Logistics Pressure: Knowing the exact number needed for each store based on pre-orders allows for much smoother, more efficient inventory allocation and shipping.

**​💖 Benefits for Customers (The Joy of Getting What You Want)**

▪︎​Stress-Free Shopping: No more waking up at 3 AM or driving to five different locations just to find empty shelves. Customers who truly want the item can secure it guaranteed.

▪︎​Fairer Access: It reduces the ability of resellers (scalpers) to wipe out stock instantly, making it easier for genuine fans to get one at the actual retail price.

▪︎​Improved Loyalty: A positive buying experience builds trust and loyalty, especially when securing a high-value, emotional purchase.

**​😌 Benefits for Baristas (A Smoother Launch Day)**

*​Reduced Chaos: The single biggest benefit*

▪︎Launch days wouldn't turn into a chaotic rush focused solely on merchandise. Baristas could focus on making coffee, food and providing great service.

▪︎​Less Conflict: Baristas wouldn't have to deal with frustrated, angry, or disappointed customers who missed out on the item, improving the overall work environment.

▪︎​Clear Inventory: The process of pulling a customer's pre-ordered item is faster and clearer than managing a free-for-all shelf display.
▪︎​Imagine this: A simple option in the Starbucks app a week before launch: ""Secure Your Holiday Gifts for In-Store Pickup.""

​What do you all think? Is this something Starbucks should implement, and what would be the best way to roll it out (e.g., in-app only, specific pickup date/time, etc.)?",0,1762559052.0,starbucks,9,0.33,False

***Gaming the systems***  

Dee looked around the Fun Tea Friday Cafe, where everyday was Friday, to make sure everyone was content. 

The wizards were drinking tea, the eldritch abomination-man was chatting with his - er, its? - girlfriend, and the vampire and werewolf were bickering. All was calm.

Most importantly, her manager, Patty, was in the back and not looking over her shoulder.

Just as Dee was about to pull out her phone to play a game, the door opened with a flourish.

A young woman with ruby-red hair that shined like stone swaggered in. She grinned wide, with pearl-white teeth and a gleam in her mismatched eyes.

“Yo, Dee!” she said, throwing her arms wide as she walked quickly to the counter.

The barista held her hands up to block the incoming hug.

“Woah, hey, don’t know you yet,” she said quickly. Dee had been having constant issues with cafe regulars recognizing her before she’d ever met them. The cafe wasn’t, exactly, *temporally* constant.

“Really?” The woman tilted her head curiously. She leaned over the counter and narrowed her eyes. Dee saw that the mismatch wasn’t heterochromia; her left eye was a beautiful shade of purple, but her right eye was, in the most literal sense, an emerald.

And her breath *reeked* of rotten eggs.

“Ohh,” the gem-eyed woman said. “Your hair is still brown. Sorry, the light made it look gold.”

She held her hand out to Dee. “The name’s Si, it’s a pleasure to meet ‘cha.”

The name rang a bell. Dee took the strange woman’s hand and thought back to a few weeks ago - in her personal timeline - when she had last, and first, met her. “Si? You look, uh, a *lot* different.”

“Oh so we *have* met already? Nice!”

“Just once. You kinda… well, you told me about this place.”

“Bet your ass I did. Best cafe in the S.T.C. Wait a sec, am *I* the one who got you a job here?”

The clacking of bones cut in as Patty emerged from the back. “No. *She* got herself a job here by putting up with some of the nonsense that goes on.” She nodded her skull over at Vlad and Remus. The vampire had just put a silver spoon in the werewolf’s coffee; the latter was trying to lunge across the table in fury.

“Nice seein’ you again, Patella,” Si said with a nod and a playful salute. Patty rolled her head enough that Dee knew she’d have rolled her eyes if she had any. 

Patty took the bow she wore on her skull off and walked around the counter to go break up the lover’s quarrel.

“Ahh, always a fun time in here,” Si said. Her whimsical sigh gave Dee a faceful of rotten egg stench again.

She took a step to the side and grabbed a coffee pot, trying to get the stronger aroma “You, uh, look a bit… *different* than when I last saw you.”

“Oh?” Si leaned on the counter and batted her eyes. “And how’d I look?”

Dee might have blushed if the other woman’s breath wasn’t so off-putting.

“Uhh… your eyes matched, I’m pretty sure. And your was… well, wasn’t like that.”

“Oh!” Si playfully smacked herself on the forehead. “Right, you’re like… rookie you. So, I’m a time traveler, right?”

“Right.”

“In 2230-ish there’s a gemstone shortage after the Earth is destroy… er… Well, there’s a drug on Mars that can transmute body parts into precious gems. A few days like this…” she opened her mouth - much to Dee’s detriment - and tapped her teeth. Dee realized they were *actually* pearlescent.

“Doesn’t that hurt?”

“Nah.” Si waved a hand dismissively. “I mean, it’s not comfortable, but when I get them harvested I get a huge payout in pure gold. I can spend that almost anywhen I want. Plus I can go to the thirty-two hundreds and get everything regrown good-as-new.

“And I can make *bank*. Got the ruby hair, emerald eye, pearl teeth, sapphire appendix, half my liver is a diamond, one of my lungs is painite - *that* is actually making it hard to run, reduced capacity and all that - some skin on my back is-""

""So is that medicine like... messing with your breath?""

""Breath?"" Si held her hand up to her mouth and exhaled, sniffing it quickly. ""Ohhh! My tonsils. Did you know that sulfur can be a gemstone? And it's *super* rare in the future.""

Field Director Sandra Lohman held two folders. A red one, and a blue one. The red folder was well-used and torn at the edges. She’d stayed up with it many nights, viewing and reviewing its contents with feverish determination. It was her safety blanket. It was her one light in the darkness – a darkness that threatened to swallow her whenever she relaxed enough to let the reality of her existence sink in.

They were all going to die. That was a fact of life. But the reality of what was happening beyond the scope of her soul was mind-boggling.

Then there was the blue folder. She *hated* that folder. It’d been given to her by her predecessor. It was a much thinner folder, as most of the directives were on a need-to-know basis. And sadly, Sandra Lohman did not need to know all that was within the blue folder. But she knew enough to hate it.

She could hear the clinking glasses from the other room. Hatchet was accelerating the stepminding procedure; turning old men and women into horny teenagers. That young people lost their entire lives in the process was a necessity. These were elites. They had to stay alive for what was to come, and Hatchet was more than happy to oblige. What was an anonymous life to a generous donation? Sandra had seen the brochures. They actually had brochures where people could pick their new bodies.

But for now, they were sipping mai tais and playing grab-ass in the other room, shrieking with delight.

*Fuck* the blue folder.

“Miss Lohman?” a mousey secretary poked her head out. “The board is ready for you.”

Sandra nodded. She got up, dusted off her gray pantsuit, and entered the boardroom.

 

Eleven people had joined by remote call. Most of them were unrecognizable, having gone through the stepminding procedure themselves. It was strange hearing such old voices come out of young mouths. Sandra sat down at the far edge of the table, looking up at the pixel-perfect screens. The secretary shut the door, leaving her alone with the buzzing electronics.

There was a cup of coffee on the table. This in itself wasn’t unusual, but there was something to the side of it. A little pack of sugar, and a little pack of milk. This bothered Sandra, but she couldn’t put her finger on why.

“Miss Lohman?” a voice interrupted. “Can you hear us?”

Sandra looked up, putting on a smile as she did.

“Yes, of course,” she responded. “Thank you for having me.”

“Pleasure is ours,” another voice added. “We have much to discuss.”

“I suppose we do. Please, enlighten me.”

One young face took center stage. A young woman, no older than 18. Despite her expertly applied makeup, Lohman could see the slight bump right above her left eyebrow – this girl used to have a piercing. Before her life was stolen, that is.

“The St.Brendan project is nearing completion,” the woman said. “We are in the final stages of deploying the Saint, and we are diverting resources to increase evacuation capacity.”

Sanda kept her smile, but her heart sank through the floor. She pushed her red folder aside and grasped the blue one. This wasn’t going to be pretty.

 “We know of your misgivings about the project,” the woman continued. “Your protests have been duly noted. But from tested and repeated data points, this is the best solution. We are diverting resources from three of your departments.”

“Three departments,” Sandra nodded. “Another three departments.”

“You have to understand, we’re at the edge of an exodus. There is no point leaving anything behind. We will take what we can, and *those* we can. That includes you, if you so choose.”

“You know I can’t accept that.”

“Which is another point of contention which we need to address.”

Sandra bit her lip and swallowed her words. She had to be careful. These people could ruin her life with the flick of a button.

 

“I know of the… data points you refer to,” Sandra said. “Twelve separate instances. All failures.”

“Because they were desperate and imperfect. You know our designs are flawless.”

“In theory, yes. But that’s what they all figured before they deployed their solutions.”

“Miss Lohman-“

“No,” Sandra interrupted. “I must be allowed to speak!”

She got up from her chair and moved across the room. Her coffee was growing cold. She moved to a whiteboard, drawing several sets of numbers. Six-digit codes in no particular order. She pointed to them one by one.

“Earliest recorded iteration. Tried the same kind of evacuation, ending up in a literal sea of *fire*. Practically, and *effectively*, hell.”

She pointed to the next set of numbers.

“These ones opened the path for the Martians. Didn’t save a single human life. All they did was open us up to a… transdimensional invasion.”

“Miss Lohman-“

She pointed to the next set of numbers. And the next. And the next.

“Infinite compression, resulting in singularity creatures like Dawn Andersen. Fragmented realities, resulting in everything from identity hiccups to outcome echoes. What did you call this? A… staccato isolation pocket? The one where the only sensation available comes at the cost of inflicting external pain? Are you not seeing what I’m seeing here?”

“Miss Lohman!” the young woman snapped back. “You’re out of line!”

“You are repeating the same mistake as every other iteration of this institution! We claim to build on what others have learned over dimensional generations, and yet you insist on making the same mistake, over and over again! They all thought they were exceptional, and now they’re *meat!*”

She tossed the blue folder to the side. The notes fluttered to the carpeted floor.

“Our dimensional neighbor *fucked up so bad* that they created the Blameless itself! And you think *your plan* is going to be any different. You think you won’t *burn* like the rest.”

“The Saint has been vetted a thousand times over! Our experiments with the House has been a wild success. You’ve reviewed the observations yourself.”

Sandra rolled her eyes at yet another mention of the Saint. A mind-fucked nobody in the same transdimensional candy-wrapping as the Others, broken into compliance like a computer with a demented brain. The damn thing could barely say ‘Hello’, if it spoke at all. That it had the potential to maintain a personalized pocket dimension, or House, was a biproduct of its timeless inhumanity and ability to navigate the in-between.

“The Houses are a trap.” Sandra said, slamming her hand on the table. “They are a trap for tortured creatures to get new toys to play with. Just because you’re making your *own* creature doesn’t mean it will stop playing. You can’t design a God by committee. It will not *care* for you. You are not crossing the bridge to Elysium, you are paving your way to hell. Actual, physical, *literal*, hell.”

 

The plans of the blue folder lay open on the floor. Ever since first contact with the Others, Hatchet had been working on an evacuation plan. But instead of trying to perfect an imperfect formula for billions of people, they’d come up with a plan to just do it once. They had manipulated this one flawless creature. Once deployed, it would generate a protective realm, much like the Houses they’d experimented with, but under their control. A paradise of their own making, in theory.

“You cannot control a God,” Sandra sighed. “You cannot trust an all-powerful being to have your best interests at heart. How can you so willingly hand over your entire being to something that will control your lives in a… deathless forever?”

“Because what you are suggesting is *suicide,*” a young man said. “You want to pop our lifeboat, hoping it will skip across the lake like a cartoon. But that’s not what’s gonna happen, miss Lohman. The lifeboat is going to *sink*.”

“Then at least I only have to die once,” Sandra spat. “You are resigning yourself to slavery.”

“We are making our own future, powered by our own engine.”

“An engine that owns and controls everything you do.”

“By parameters we’ve set.”

Sandra shook her head. It was the same discussion as last time.

 

“We are diverting resources. We are going to save more people,” a man with a kind voice said. “You are welcome to join us. But know that if you choose not to, your funds are going to run out. And it won’t be long.”

“We’re already at the breaking point. We can’t hold the fissure in Tomskog. We’ve already had containment breaches at the Pit. For God’s sakes, we’ve-“

She stopped herself and put a hand on her red folder. She could share it. She could change things. There was still time.

“Miss Lohman,” the kind man continued. “None of this matters. Let the Yearwalkers roam. Let it all loose. We’ll be in paradise long before the year is over anyway.”

“You are committed to this then,” Sandra said. “You’ll be pulling plugs until there is nothing left to pull, and you’re leaving this world to rot.”

“We’re doing what we can. You know we do. But Noah’s ark didn’t take a million of each animal, and neither can we.”

Sandra kept her mouth shut, pushing the red folder away. She looked back at her coffee. Now she realized why it’d bothered her. She used to have a special brand of coffee at these meetings. She used to have it prepared in a certain way. Now it was… this. They were cutting her off. They were going to slash every department, at every turn, until there was nothing left. They would turn off the lights and leave the world in the dark.

And they would dance – naked, young, and beautiful, into the benevolent maw of their eternal Godslave.

 

They explained the immediate changes. Sandra Lohman said nothing. They were cutting security budgets. Surveillance details. Border operations. They were concentrating all of their efforts on a few key locations around the globe, collecting elites ready to hand off their earthly possessions. No wonder the world was on the brink of chaos. Decisionmakers and shot callers were having their minds switched with children. A push of a button was all that stood between them and nuclear winter, and that button had the thumb of a confused 19-year-old on it. A 19-year-old in the body of an old man.

By the end of the briefing, Lohman got up from her chair and walked away. She smiled and waved and said the right things, leaving her coffee untouched on the table. It’d grown cold anyway. She held her red folder tight as she passed through the hall. Music was playing from an open bar. A state legislator, a man with four kids and a wife, had stepminded into an 18-year-old surfer kid. Now he was on the couch, feeling up a supreme court justice as a Fortune 500 billionaire poured Merlot down his unzipped pants. It was an end of the world party, after all.

There was a car waiting for Sandra outside. She might not have the resources to keep the original plan afloat, but she had something else. It wasn’t pretty, but it might work. It was a matter of hours, and she had to time things right, but it was possible. She had the connections and the will to follow through. After all, she was just making some budget cuts of her own.

 

As soon as the car door closed, the world went quiet. Sandra put the red folder down and put on her seat belt. The noise reduction of the hermetically sealed vehicle made her lightheaded, but calm. Her assistant sitting across from her, on the other hand, was anything but calm.

“How’d it go?” she asked.

Linda the assistant was a scared-looking thing. Early thirties, NSA background. Thinning hairline from constantly picking at her scalp. Her tiny round glasses made her look like something out of the Matrix. It hadn’t occurred to Sandra how many similarities there were. Red pill, blue pill. Red folder, blue folder. It was almost funny.

“We’re all done,” Sandra said. “Heading back to HQ.”

“Did we get the cut? What’s going on?”

“We’re fine,” Sandra said. “They got it under control.”

“So… there’s a containment plan? Is that next on the agenda?”

“I think that’s enough questions for now.”

Sandra leaned back in her seat and checked the folder again. The satellite footage was unmistakable. The march of the Martians over the west coast of France. Landfall in New England. These creatures and their caretakers were on a direct collision course with Hatchet and the many people under its wing. It was going to be a bloodbath.

Then again, three departments were slashed. One of them was literally the surveillance operatives. Mistakes were bound to happen.

“Here,” Sandra said, handing the red folder to Linda. “Take it.”

“Sure,” Linda nodded.

“And when we get to the airport, burn it.”

“Miss Lohman?”

“You heard me. Burn it,” Sandra said, leaning in. “Any questions?”

Linda shook her head. Sandra looked her assistant in the white of her eyes. They seemed to have an understanding.

 

The ride went on for a couple of hours. The tinted windows hinted at darkened landscapes passing by. Empty forests replaced with long shadows and occasional reflection. Sandra wasn’t used to seeing herself like this. She was supposed to be *older*. But where the others had succumbed to an idea of youthful paradise, she’d held on to hope. They had to do something different. Every other iteration of Hatchet, at every turn, had tried to do the same thing. They’d aimed for Heaven, and dove straight into Hell. Someone had to break the cycle. She would not be the one to find herself tortured and broken to the point of losing herself. She wouldn’t be like the others.

Even so, she still got the procedure. Her old body was still in a cold storage facility in West Virginia.

There was no way she could juggle all the remaining threats. Not the Yearwalkers, not the Martians, not the goddamned Fractionites living at the edge of a timeless void. Those things creeped her out. No, she would have to relinquish control and make do with what she had. At least for now. She had to prioritize.

They got to the airport. Linda shuffled off to the side and burned the red folder right on the tarmac. There was no praise or acknowledgement; it had to be done. Now it was. That was that. Sandra watched the ashes drift into the wind as the private jet engines began to spin. She and Linda exchanged a glance. The assistant had known her boss long enough to know when to shut up.

 

They settled into their flight as Sandra turned on her many screens. There was a flood of status reports ranging from satellite images to field operatives. A couple of screens had gone dark. They weren’t supposed to.

The plane rumbled as they prepared for takeoff. Sandra hated flying. Her ears would pop, and it would take hours for them to settle in. And it always *hurt*. That was, perhaps, the most notable difference between this body and her old one. Linda was still on her first body. Sandra suspected she might not even know that stepminding was a thing. Either way, that folder had caused silence between them, and for all her faults, Linda was a decent worker. Sandra decided to break the ice.

“You read a lot of Nietzsche?” she asked.

“Not really,” Linda admitted. “I dated a psychology major once though.”

“Insufferable people,” Sandra sighed. “But Nietzsche had this idea of master and slave morality. It’s quite interesting.”

Sandra settled into her chair, pushing aside a couple of notifications. Entire branches were going dark, but that was to be expected.

“Slave morality is the… values, wants, and ideals of the oppressed. They look at their oppressors and view their attributes as something bad. Meanwhile, they look to their own virtues as something good. If you’re poor, you start to consider rich people to be bad. It’s not necessarily true, but it’s a way to… contextualize the world. To make it make sense. It’s easier to come to terms with your own failures when you consider the opposition to be… unjust, or wicked.”

“Alright, I’m with you,” Linda said.

“Now imagine we make a God,” Sandra said. “We create a God, and we ask it to bring us a paradise. No matter what we get, it won’t be perfect. It can’t be. We are too different to be able to perceive a perfect utopia. So…”

Sandra leaned in, looking Linda in the eye.

“…someone won’t be happy,” she continued. “All it takes is one. One person who’s not happy about how things turned out. What can they do? They can’t force a God to do their bidding. It cannot be controlled. So they do what little they can.”

“And what is that?”

“They start *hating* that God. They start *hating* that broken promise. And when that hatred gets out of control, that God will have no choice left but to put that person back in line. To oppress, to change. And once it realizes it can break those people without any kind of consequence, without any *checks*, or *balances*, or… *accountability*. What do you think happens?”

Linda shook her head as Sandra leaned back in her chair.

“That God will do whatever it wants. And at some point, it will realize those people are its creators. That it had a *life* taken away. Maybe a family. A home. And it will be stuck with those people, in an eternal bubble, with complete dominion. Do you think it will take good care of those people?”

“No,” Linda swallowed hard. “I suppose it won’t.”

“I agree.”

Sandra closed her laptop and looked out the window. Nothing but clouds. But in the distance, she knew something was stirring. Something just out of sight. Sandra smiled.

“When falsehood can look so like the truth, who can assure themselves of certain happiness?”

“More Nietzsche?” Linda asked.

“Mary Shelley,” Sandra smirked. “Frankenstein.”

 

Having eased the tension, the flight took its course. They were crossing four states, hoping to be back on the Frog Lake Fissure site by morning. With the Martians rallying on the east coast, they troops on the ground would finally get a breather. No more having to keep your guns trained on a spot of dirt, hoping nothing peeks out.

Linda had a nap in her chair. Sandra tried to respond to a couple e-mails. Departments were being shuttered, just like they’d done with Galapagos. They were selling off decades of work at breakneck speed, hoping to liquidate whatever they could. Local offices were practically given away for nothing. Land sold to entrepreneurs hoping to build a business that would never come.

These people were planning for the rapture, and they weren’t leaving any scraps out for their dogs.

Sandra could still join them. She’d considered it. She’d tried, desperately, to rationalize it. Maybe this time would be different. Maybe they’d perfected the formula. Maybe they had created an infinitely lenient warden for their gilded cage. There might even be a world where she’d like that.

But no, that wasn’t going to happen. They’d made a Godslave, and once it came to realize this, the table would turn. It always did. It always had.

 

The plane landed early in the morning. Linda woke up with a snort. Sandra was still reviewing her e-mails, trying to motivate herself to respond to one more. It was almost time.

“How long was I out?” Linda asked.

“Four hours, maybe five,” Sandra said. “You go ahead and get the bags.”

“Sure. You want a coffee?”

Sandra nodded. It didn’t take Linda long to come back with a perfect cup. The exact level of milk and sugar. Not too hot, not too cold.

Sandra turned the cup over in her hand. It was magnificent. Linda could do what an entire building of Hatchet officials couldn’t. The thought wasn’t lost on her; maybe you didn’t need the backing of a multinational conglomerate. Maybe, at the end of the day, you could get by with just one. A good one.

“I need some space,” Sandra said. “Got some work before we head out.”

“Alright, I’ll wait in the car.”

“It’ll be a while.”

“I don’t mind,” Linda smiled. “I’ll stream something.”

Sandra watched her leave. As the door clicked shut, she stepped away to make sure the cockpit was empty. It was. For a brief moment, she was alone on a private plane – one lined with blue sunflower logos down the lengths of the cabin. Sandra sat back down and opened her laptop, turning to her surveillance software.

 

There was confirmed movement. The Martians were about to reach the Hatchet Exploratory. There’d be an evacuation, of course. They’d spot something, even without her red folder report. There were layers of backups, and every single one of them could prevent a disaster.

That was, of course, unless something happened.

Sandra Lohman knew people, and how to make them do things. She asked one of these people to remotely disable the motion sensors, leaving the outer perimeter blind. She asked another one to switch up the guard schedule. A third one was asked to have the main gates malfunction, leaving them wide open.

There would be no plausible deniability for this. They’d see the logs and who ordered it. But by then, the deed would be done. Maybe she’d do enough damage for the project to be scrapped, or at least delayed. But it would be costly. It had to be.

 

Sandra put one of the gate cameras on her main screen, maximizing the window. She could see clouds roll in from the horizon. To a neutral observer, it was just bad weather. To a trained eye, the clouds were too fast. The Martians had many ways to travel, but using their caretakes was by far the eeriest. The Cloudfathers. What a peculiar mutation.

The feed from the first camera cut out, as planned. Using a remote access token, a second camera popped up. The rainstorm was ruthless. Even without functional sound, Sandra could imagine the noise. There were dark shapes walking out of thin air. Their mindless followers took point as the brunt of the spearhead. Rain drinkers. What a stupid concept.

Another camera. A guard post was quietly overwhelmed as a checkpoint disappeared into the dark.

“Golden Four, confirm position, over” a static voice crackled. “Golden Four, I repeat, confirm position, over.”

The camera shows a man running, then being tackled to the ground. Three people held him down as a large shadow moved closer. His head was just a pixel as it was torn from his neck; a little white spot turning red.

 

The voices grew louder. More intense.

“Golden Four, last call to designation, I repeat…”

“Saxon Five, moving to intercept mission point B…”

“Explorer Red, we’re receiving reports of, uh…”

They were already through the gates. The wide-open gates. Two people in orange jumpsuits were dragged from a forklift and decapitated. It was quick – like pulling apart a wet napkin.

“Jesus Christ, what the hell is-“

“Saxon Five to tac com, multiple Tangos! Multiple Tangos!”

“How the fuck did they get-“

Screams. Primordial, guttural screams. Channels were going offline one by one. On another camera, Sandra watched as curious partygoers looked up from their drinks as armed men rushed by. People were pulled from their seats and ushered into back rooms at gunpoint. Sandra couldn’t look away from this one man who was too drunk to get out of a hot tub. She thought he might have been an investment banker. Quite a successful one, at that.

“Multiple casualties! Multiple casualties!”

“No! No!”

“Engage! Engage! For fuck’s sake, engage!”

A man was torn open like a ripe orange. Partygoers tried to shield themselves with their naked arms as they were picked off, one by one. They were thrown across the room. Impaled. Crushed. One of the Martians put a tentacle so far down one of their throats that it looked like he was wearing him as a glove.

Sandra saw the muzzle flashes. The night vision cameras had pretty bad resolution, but they were pretty in their own way. Green and white sparkles. One by one, the lights went out. Voices turned silent. Little pop-up notifications had started to appear. They were all asking Sandra the same thing.

What have you *done?*

A final camera showed a handful of people hiding in a walk-in freezer. There was no sound. The door flung open as an amorphous creature loomed in the doorway, watching its victims scurry into the corner. It advanced, a step at a time. It was accompanied by a swarm of tree frogs, eagerly jumping ahead.

The last thing Sandra saw before the feed was cut was a long appendage wrapping around the neck of an award-winning economist, as he was dragged into the open maw of an otherworldly creature.

 

Sandra shut her laptop. It was done. Come what may, at least she’d chosen her path. She’d agonized over this for weeks, even bringing the damn folder to their doorstep. If only they’d listened. Compromised, even. Anything. But no – they were stubborn and shortsighted. Now her plan was clear. There was no ambiguity about what was going to happen next. Just as they’d done, she was ready to throw anyone and everyone under the bus to reach her goal. That’s what it was now. *Her* plan.

She picked up her coffee and stirred it with a spoon. Not a plastic one, but not silver either.

And by God – it was perfect.",4,1762558788.0,Saturdead,0,1.0,False
1ora278,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldantlercritics/comments/1ora278/nov_4_audio_post_pt_1/,Nov 4 audio post pt 1,"Hey travelers, it's your friend Jenna, and I am here with the November Farm Update Podcast. This (0:07) is the tradition now. I start off the month with a podcast talking about the farm and what's going (0:14) on with myself, the animals, the schedule, the plans, the mortgage, everything happening in my (0:19) life as it pertains to me remaining here at Cold Antler Farm.  
Well, let's see. I guess we'll start (0:27) off with the brass tacks. It's Samhain weekend, or it was just Samhain weekend, which is a pretty (0:34) heavy holiday for anyone of my faith tradition.  
It's a time for really solemn memories. There's (0:43) Halloween with the slutty costumes and the candy and the parties and the slasher films. That's very (0:48) secular, and that's very much not my idea of Halloween, which if you're paying for this, (0:53) you probably already know that.  
But the intensity of the weekend was matched with the fact that for (1:00) this holiday that's focusing on memories and remembrance, I lost a really important person (1:07) to me, someone who has affected my life in a way very few people have. I said this to my friend (1:16) during Dumb Supper, and I'll say it again, that a lot of people aren't very memorable. (1:23) Think of the hundreds of people you interact with in a week.  
From people in line at checkouts to (1:30) people at the library, no matter what you do, work, office commuting, people on the highway, (1:37) a lot of people aren't memorable. But every once in a while, you meet someone who you can't shake. (1:42) My friend was one of those people, and he was responsible for so many brave steps in my life.(1:48) Sometimes all you need is someone who tells you what you're worried about will be okay. (1:53) A lot of us don't have that. We want to achieve goals and we want to try to do risky things, (1:59) whether it's professionally or emotionally or socially or just with our savings accounts or (2:06) stock options.  
Not that I have stock options, but you know what I mean? Risk transcends all (2:11) kinds of situations. He was just someone who was really brave. He died doing something really (2:20) brave.  
While it was shocking, it wasn't surprising to any of us. It's exactly the kind of way you (2:25) think you'll lose somebody. He was freediving near Indonesia.  
He was born in the Midwest, (2:36) taught himself computer programming, traveled the world, was living off of a sailboat and was out (2:43) adventuring. I feel like the universe was like, you know what? You've got it all figured out. (2:48) It's on to the next thing.  
But it was a heavy weekend. I contacted... I don't think that she'd (2:55) mind me sharing this, but I heard about it from his ex-wife, who was a really close friend of (3:00) mine. I hadn't seen her in six years.  
I invited her to come to Dumb Supper and she did. Celebrating (3:08) and honoring this man's life was also the thing that rekindled a six-year estranged friendship. (3:14) We caught each other up on our lives and I got to hear about hers.  
It was just so lovely. It's (3:30) how they've gotten through hardship and came out the other side better. If you can do that while (3:36) remembering someone you truly loved, it was pretty powerful.  
That was my Samoan night. (3:43) And then on November 1st, which is technically still the holiday, the new year for our folk, (3:50) our community had our group Samoan gathering, which really is entirely just a potluck party. (3:56) But it was the last outdoor bonfire potluck, sitting at dusk and eating cheesy potatoes and (4:04) meat pies and stewed... Oh my gosh, we had amazing curries and vegetables and homemade (4:12) breads and somebody made a tahini banana bread, which was very good with some poppy seed.  
Anyway, (4:20) it was delicious. It was a great, beautiful holiday and the kids were running around and (4:24) our group, the kids all... The theme is everyone dresses up as something inspired by nature. (4:28) I had my poodle mask, which was mildly terrifying, but still counted as nature.(4:34) We were pretty loose with the rules. But kids came dressed in all black with just (4:38) twinkle lights on a battery pack and they were the night sky. That was one family and (4:43) someone else dressed up as the river with a fish hat.  
It was just really cool. It was just really (4:48) fun. It was a nice contrast to the heaviness and import of the evening before.(4:56) So a big weekend. And then on that Sunday, I was visiting a friend who is recovering from surgery (5:02) and she's doing well. I brought pizza dough and cheese and sauce and everything they would (5:08) need to literally just put the dough in a pan in the oven with cooking instructions and (5:14) delivered a pizza pre-made so they don't have to worry about dinner.(5:18) And after that... Oh, and I was also thanking them because her husband cut down some... An old maple (5:24) tree died on their woodlot and he cut it up into pieces small enough for my stove. So we went to (5:29) load that up. So it was just a busy weekend of the holiday to kick off the beginning of the month.(5:35) And I'm all socialized out as I get back into preparing for the work week. Let's see. (5:41) That's enough about sowing weekend.  
I guess... Oh, I'm preparing for a pretty long visit from (5:50) a really close friend. I'm so excited to have another person here to make breakfast for and (5:56) have the fire and the house warm for. And I've never had my friend visit this long during the (6:03) hunting season with a hawk.  
So hopefully we'll get to have some time in the woods with Fletch. (6:08) That's Friday playing with a stuffed fox toy in the living room as I record this, (6:12) if you hear a squeaky sound. I'm getting ready to take Fletch out after I finish recording this.(6:19) She's been doing so well, but I've never had a hawk so active. And she just needs to fly more, (6:25) and I'm here for it. It's a nice distraction from other things.  
And it's just been lovely (6:32) having this relationship with this bird. She follows so well. I've been training birds for (6:36) over a decade.  
In the past, every bird's a different bird. They all have their own personalities. (6:42) Anyone who keeps chickens or has birds knows this, that just like cats or dogs, (6:47) all people are different people.  
And that includes all animals are different animals. And (6:53) this bird is just so much more social and so much more keyed into me and just needs more (6:58) interaction. And I'm giving it to her, spending a lot of time with her.  
So looking forward to the (7:04) sun's out after a night of rain, and the heaviness of the weekend has passed. (7:10) And so I'm hoping to finish up some illustration work and check my emails and then head out with (7:15) my bird and flyer in the squirrel paths across the mountain, where I have permission to walk (7:20) on a neighbor's land far from my chickens and cats, where we can just... That's her bells, (7:26) if you can hear in the background. She's on a perch in my kitchen waiting to get her (7:31) muse jesses switched out with hunting jesses and flying gear, so we can go and enjoy that.(7:38) So I guess that's all the emotional and instant news I have I should talk about. (7:44) The farm in general is still preparing for winter, but I am well on my way. There are three cords of (7:50) firewood here, which covers my firewood needs until about early February.  
And I'm still trying (7:56) to get another one in, but things have been really tight and sales have been really bad, (8:02) as you can imagine. Think about how much you're pinching pennies and cutting back on stuff and (8:08) canceling subscriptions. But those of us who make a living literally off people feeling comfortable (8:14) enough to support and patronize the arts, it's getting hard.  
I've had three sales since our last (8:22) farm update. But I have some freelance checks coming in, and I'm really grateful that November (8:29) is the month that a lot of you found me and signed up and came to Substack. So I am really (8:35) hoping and counting on those things to cover the mortgage and for me not to follow behind.(8:41) It's been two months now that I haven't fallen behind after five years of every morning waking (8:49) up and wondering if this is the week you find out you're losing the farm. And living on that kind of (8:54) like anxiety alone for four or five years, it tears your heart apart. You get so stressed out.(9:03) So I'm still here and I'm confident about this month and I can't look much farther ahead than (9:11) that without going crazy, especially with our current state of the world. So as of right now, (9:16) three cords of firewood and my hay guy is delivering another small load of hay, 16 or 17 bales, (9:25) like a hundred dollars worth. And I'm going to put that in the barn and that'll cover (9:29) having one horse instead of two and not having a big flock right now, but preparing for a larger (9:36) flock.  
It is a time where hay is not, I don't go through as much hay. The pigs go through a lot (9:42) of hay, both they enjoy snacking on it and bedding and playing with it. So it's not like (9:48) I'm throwing 10 bales in there a week for them to just rip apart.  
But every couple of days they (9:52) need fresh hay and they need maybe a bale in there to play around. I have four female pigs (9:59) and I've never had just four female pigs. And let me tell you, they're great.  
Without any sort (10:05) of male aggression or hormones, it's just four girls solving problems in the barn. It's like, (10:12) they're like, they're so active. They're so playful.  
I had to put up a little jungle gym (10:19) for them. I set up hay bales and they would go, I set up hay bales against the barn window and (10:25) they would climb up and like play tag and jump in and out and like pigs can climb by the way. (10:31) It's a wild thing to see.  
They've just been such a blast. I've been taking all the pumpkins from (10:38) Samhain and anything that's not like moldy or gross, just a normal carved pumpkin. I smash it (10:45) and then throw the pumpkin chunks in and they have been loving that.  
They've been doing great. (10:51) I'm really happy with these pigs. I love raising pigs.  
I love pigs. I love every part of pigs. (10:58) So they're doing good.  
Mabel's doing well. She's got her winter coat in. You can dig your fingers (11:04) an inch deep into that thickness of her winter coat.  
Some people don't realize that a horse (11:11) from a distance looks like a short haired animal and when you get up close to a Northeast horse, (11:15) you can like, it's like putting your hand into a shag carpet, a plush carpet. It just sinks in. (11:21) So she's got her coat in and I got to take her, it's the time of year that I should take her (11:28) blanket down to the laundromat on my next run and get that cleaned out and prepared.  
She hasn't (11:35) used a blanket yet because it hasn't dipped below. I usually don't use a blanket unless (11:39) it's going to be in the teens. So she's doing great.  
Let's see. The farrier should come (11:48) in the next couple of weeks for her last trim before winter and then she'll be set until spring. (11:53) Not all horses can go that long between trims, but my horses literally live on a mountainside (11:59) and put their hooves on exposed bedrock every day.  
And my farrier told me this is a schedule (12:07) I should use. It's pointless and a waste of money to just have him come and file feet a little bit (12:13) and like trim like a millimeter of hoof edge, you know? So following his orders, I'm going to have (12:19) him come and trim her up and then we'll go back to looking forward to him in the spring. So (12:26) Mabel's doing good.  
I've been spending a lot of time with her. A lot of, even this late in the (12:31) season, I still let her out in the lawn because it has the last remnants of like truly green grass (12:37) and she kind of explores and sticks her head in the chicken coop and then walks to the stream to (12:43) get water. It's just been lovely having a yard horse every once in a while.  
Not every day and (12:47) I don't ever let her in the yard when I'm not home, but it's really nice to be, well, it's still (12:52) nice out every once in a while to sit in a hammock chair or on the deck and be reading a book and (12:57) have her show up to the deck for a treat, run inside, get her a carrot. There's worse ways to (13:02) spend a Tuesday afternoon. Other animals.  
The sheep are so fat. They are so flushed. They are (13:10) so ready.  
I just remember a little over a year ago, I was worried they were going to die from (13:15) a really bad bout of parasites and a really low level of selenium in general and minerals that (13:22) were not, they were just low on it. And the mineral supplement I had for them wasn't giving (13:28) them enough. And so we've made some changes.  
Me and some other shepherds around here, I got (13:33) into talking with them and now they're doing beyond good. They're doing a little too good, (13:38) but this next weekend I'm going to be picking up the ram lamb and hopefully that will start (13:43) the breeding season. But there's preparation before that, making sure the fences are tight (13:47) and electric, making sure everything's ready as far as picking up an animal and driving it (13:53) from one mountain to another.  
Luckily I'll have help for that. So I'm a little, mostly excited, (14:00) but that's another big step. It's been a while since we've had lambs in the spring and I'm hoping (14:04) for good luck and better luck than I had last time.  
Any other news as far as animals? Pigs, (14:14) I covered pigs. The flock is doing great. I'm just put the last of the glass doors on the chicken (14:19) coop that cover up the chicken wire window.  
Like a whole side of it is pretty exposed to get fresh (14:25) air flow and stuff in the winter and keep them from becoming like a sauna in summer. But that (14:31) has to be covered with glass, mostly for wind. If you're not aware, chickens can handle the cold.(14:37) You don't need to ever have a heated coop, but they need to be windproof because just like (14:44) we're used to down, the reason you have a down jacket that keeps you warm is because it's (14:51) usually held in puffy panels that wind can't get through. And the insulation of those feathers (14:58) are dry and next to your skin. And there's a piece of nylon or Gore-Tex or something over it (15:04) that stops the wind from separating those feathers and hitting your skin.  
The same with (15:09) chickens. They're naturally, they have their under down feathers, their under soft feathers, (15:14) and then they have their guard feathers on the outside. And those guard feathers act as the Gore-Tex (15:19) or nylon and those inner feathers are the insulation.  
And they can sit on a cold coop all (15:24) night with their breasts down over their cold feet and tuck in their head and be fine below (15:30) freezing. But if the wind got through and ruffled their feathers and made it so that wind was (15:36) hitting raw skin and not letting them insulate, they could absolutely become hypothermic and die. (15:43) So windproofing the coop, that's all done.  
But the chickens, they're doing well. I really can't (15:51) complain. Knock on wood.  
Let me find wood. They have not had... Oh, Friday. Friday.  
Excuse me, (15:59) folks. Friday. That was a luck knock.  
Thank you. Thank you for being so vigilant. Thank you.(16:06) It was luck knocking. It's okay. She's doing well.  
Her biggest concern is losing extra weight (16:14) from a summer on meds and no exercise. So she's doing... My little chubby girl is doing well. (16:21) She's got all her body parts inside her body.  
How about that? How about that? And (16:27) allergy season is almost over. So she's just the most relaxed she's been in months. And that's (16:32) really helped with my nerves as well.  
So she's doing good. And what I was knocking on wood (16:38) for was the fact that we've been very lucky this season, the farm, the royal, we have been lucky (16:43) that there has not been the loss of chickens to predators, at least not yet. And it's a free (16:52) range flock.  
I know that a wayfaring fox or a fisher cat or possums or raccoons or anyone could (17:00) take advantage if they wanted to figure it out or a weasel. But so far, the flock's been doing well. (17:06) They're shutting down their egg production pretty much.  
I'm getting one or two eggs a day as opposed (17:11) to five or seven, but it's still enough to feed me and take care of me. And I guess that's a good (17:17) segue into winter provisions. If you're not aware, if you're a new subscriber, I live my life very (17:24) much like people do on that game, Oregon Trail, where I have to prepare for going into winter.(17:32) My income is never reliable. I never know if I'm going to make $2,000 a month or more, (17:40) but I need to make at least that much for mortgage and bills and stuff. So sometimes (17:45) that's hard to do and you can't always budget for groceries and food.  
So I always make sure (17:53) that there's months and months of food in the house. And it's what got me through summer. (17:59) The help of some farm friends came and helped me with summer food and stuff.  
And then this winter, (18:05) I got a hundred pounds of flour. I've got 20 pounds of sugar. I've got enough bread yeast in (18:11) the freezer, fridge, and in vacuum sealed storage that pretty much from now until March, there could (18:18) be a loaf of bread every other day.  
And that's a great basis for just a lot of good meals, (18:25) eggs on toast, toast in general, bread with dipping in soups and stews and a fresh bread (18:33) or biscuits that goes so well with like wild game. I'm hoping I get a deer this year. (18:37) I would love to get a deer.  
That's like 50 pounds of meat for the freezer. (18:43) Well, I mean, wish me luck. Deer season isn't until the end of this month closer to, (18:48) closer to, Ooh, I'm watching a Jay take off.  
Sorry. Blue Jay. Isn't to the end of more towards (18:55) Thanksgiving.  
So deer season's a way off, but you know, we've got our bird out there hunting. (19:00) It's been a, I'm hoping for some real drive coming up for, it'll be easier once the ground (19:07) is more cold and there's a, when there's a snow cover, hunting is a lot easier with a hawk because (19:14) they can sure as heck see a brown rabbit against a white snow a lot easier than a, than, you know, (19:19) a brown rabbit through leaves that are still on the trees and like thorn leaves and brush cover. (19:26) And like, there's still a lot of green out there, even though most of the, (19:31) I would say 70% of the trees are bare, but there's still like, I'm looking at a beautiful (19:37) fireworks of orange sycamore.  
I have a beautiful sycamore on my property. (19:42) That's probably like 50 feet tall now. But when I moved in, it was 10 feet tall 15 years ago.  
And (19:49) it's just such a beautiful tree in like near the stream on my property. And that one's holding (19:54) on with its giant leaves that are as big as my face. But the maples are pretty much done.  
The (20:01) oaks are holding on to their last leaves. The locusts are bare, which makes them look like (20:06) I'm on, you know, indoor in the winter. But in general, the season is, is wrapping up beautifully.(20:15) I think I lost my winter provisions what I was talking about. So besides I have all my potatoes, (20:21) it was not a good squash year. So I don't have a lot of butternut squash.  
But what I do have is (20:25) stacked and stored away. There's a freezer full of whole frozen chickens and pork and some lambs (20:34) still from those I still have some lamb from like, last year or the year before, I believe that's (20:41) still in the freezer. So I got to use that use it or lose it.  
Everything gets used no matter what (20:47) if I'm a little worried about the lamb being a little too off for me or I just get nervous (20:51) about flavor or anything, you can roast it, slice it up and add it to like dog food if I wanted to (20:58) it seems like a real waste of fresh natural lamb but it's happened in years past you just get (21:03) overwhelmed and nothing should get ever get thrown out not anything that you put all the work into (21:08) into raising and a living animal and a life you took you don't you don't waste that. (21:13) Um, so winter provisions are in good I'm not going to go through my whole list but (21:19) besides wanting to buy in some extra potatoes and the hideous cost of coffee. I'm a little low on (21:27) coffee but it's just in years past you could get a whole winters of coffee like for 100 bucks if (21:33) you wanted to spill it all at once and get you know, 10 pounds of coffee, but coffee is no longer (21:39) $10 a pound, it's double or sometimes triple that so coffee is a little more dear this year (21:46) but well, I'll figure it out.  
I'll survive. Plenty of tea. I got plenty of tea of caffeine (21:52) is the name of the game.  
I'm not gonna be in any sort of withdrawal. Let's see any other news. (21:58) I am.  
Boy, I hope this is still recording. Yeah, yeah. Other news.  
Let's see. Let's talk about (22:05) some good news. I am.  
I'm working on something right now that's kind of important. It's a letter (22:12) I want to write to my readers about how much you guys mean to me. Once we hit this time of year, (22:20) I have a really hard time with what is the quote unquote, the holiday season Thanksgiving, (22:27) Christmas, New Year's, it is a really dark time for me due to like, issues and like estrangement (22:34) from family.  
And it's the time of year where that's all you hear about. And it's just a heavy (22:43) time. And I've outgrown like in my 20s and 30s, I would attend like Friendsgivings or be the extra (22:50) person at the table for my Christmas dinner and all that kind of stuff.  
Because culturally, (22:55) it's still a big day, even if it's not like a religion I care for believe in, but like, (23:00) it's still a big day when you're raised in those traditions, they're still special. (23:04) And I have no qualms with Christmas or Thanksgiving, like in theory, it's just that (23:10) it's hard when you're by yourself. And when you don't have that kind of like family tie anymore, (23:16) and you can get real maudlin, I can get real maudlin and melancholy and generally bummed out.(23:23) So having this audience of people who I may never meet in real life, but know me and know my life (23:31) and know about Friday's surgeries and my firewood and flower, like preparations for the long winter (23:39) on this homestead. And, you know, like, you're out there listening, like, you know about me, (23:45) like I exist in your life, even if just in your ears or in your email, and it makes a woman feel (23:51) less alone. And I always, if you haven't noticed already, the writing gets a little more (23:56) introspective in the winter, because there's so much less to write about, as far as like, (24:03) fishing or like outdoors or big farm plans.  
And there's just more time spent indoors by the fire, (24:12) which would make anyone living alone in a mountain farm a little more contemplative. So (24:17) I don't want that to mean bummer. I don't want that contemplation to mean like, negative or sad, (24:23) I would really like to focus on positive heady things.  
And anyway, I want to start that off with (24:30) a thank you letter, because I'm going to be depending on you guys so much. And by depending, (24:36) I don't mean like, financially, I mean, like, also financially, but mostly emotionally, like, (24:41) if you're not the kind of person who likes to comment, if you're not the kind of person who (24:45) hits like, you know, please do. It's not, it doesn't really make that much of a difference, (24:51) as far as like engagement or the algorithm on Substack.  
But it does make a difference to me, (24:56) when you spend three or four days working on an essay or writing or (25:00) baring your soul or sharing something really important. Having someone the like doesn't mean (25:05) like I approve or I like what you wrote about it just means I'm here. I saw this.  
I'm a human being (25:10) and I read it and I listened and thank you for sharing or, you know, it's just, you have no idea (25:17) how much those things can mean to a person who doesn't really have other measurements (25:23) for how or if she is affecting the world in any positive way. So even if you just like the story, (25:30) hit those buttons, say a comment. One person wrote me and said they like, (25:35) they sent me an email or a note.  
Sometimes when people become paying subscribers, they can (25:39) like leave a note and I always read them and I always appreciate them. And someone said they're (25:45) not brave enough to comment yet, which as someone who's sharing their entire life in detail with (25:50) the public for over 20 years, I was like, what do you mean you're not brave? Like, what do you mean? (25:55) You can, you can write to me, you can comment to me. It's not even like they have like their own, (25:59) like they didn't even have like their own Substack, I don't think, or like their own (26:03) profile picture.  
They were an anonymous looking account. But I realized some folks are just like, (26:08) I don't want to speak up, but I don't want to leave a comment. Well, I'm here to say, (26:13) I sure as hell would appreciate it.  
It means a lot. You can't know how much it means, (26:19) especially between now and now and middle of January. And then once we get through the (26:25) holidays, it's just getting through the rest of winter, which is so much, it's so much harder, (26:30) like physically on the body, the cold, taking care of the farm in deep winter, keeping the house warm (26:36) with just two wood stoves on the same latitude line as like Portland, Maine.  
Like I'm up here, (26:43) I'm in upstate New York, but I'm still going. And I've passed the halfway mark. (26:51) Some of you have been listening to me since I bought this place or reading me since I bought (26:55) this place.  
And it's been 15 years, half of the mortgage, I'm still here. And looking around the (27:01) farmhouse, things are better than they've ever been as far as like just getting a life together. (27:08) So I'm hoping that as it feels like every time I turn on the news, the world's falling apart.  
But (27:14) in my own home, things are getting better for the first time in like years. And that is a (27:20) complicated and anxious juxtaposition to be realizing that you're like, I'm finally fixing (27:28) my credit score a couple points a month. I'm finally caught up on bills, like my electric bills (27:33) caught up.  
Like I'm on top of like my trash bill. I'm on top of electricity and like other things (27:41) that have been behind or on payment plans for so long. It's like things are caught up.  
The mortgage (27:45) is caught up. And I just, I'm so scared that all of it's going to fall apart because people don't (27:53) want to or can't, not don't want to, can't afford to support writers or can't afford to pay for (28:00) substacks or Patreons. And I just want you to know it doesn't have to be me.  
But if you can make it (28:07) work to support one creative person out there, one substack, one YouTuber, one writer, one artist, (28:14) one Patreon, whatever it is, a couple of you can spare a couple dollars a month for whoever you (28:19) feel is most important to you. It certainly doesn't have to be me. It probably isn't.(28:24) But if there's someone out there in the arts, you can still support and manage to support them. (28:29) Please do. It's so hard.  
You have no idea how hard it is making a living right now when you (28:37) don't have a traditional income stream or job. And people don't necessarily want to spend money (28:43) on things like half pigs or logos or illustrations. Everything I sell, you don't have to buy.(28:49) So when things get tough, it gets scary. So keep the artists and the writers and creatives in your (28:58) thoughts. We're all doing our best.  
I think that's it. I'm going to get my bird ready to fly. (29:07) After that, I'm going to head down to the one room schoolhouse that is down the road from me, (29:12) which is my polling place and vote.  
I'm voting for a local justice. It's New York elections today. (29:22) So there's some big races down in New York City and stuff, which I'm very excited to watch.(29:28) But around here in this little corner of Washington County, we're voting for (29:33) some local positions within councils. And I think Justice for the Peace and some other positions. (29:41) And your local government's your most important government.  
So hopefully you're active in taking (29:46) part in those smaller elections because they're what change your community. And as poorly as me (29:54) and my mother and father get along right now, I cannot tell you how",2,1762558766.0,coldantlercritics,3,1.0,False

1ora13r,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenDatingOverForty/comments/1ora13r/a_coffee_is_not_a_contract/,A coffee is not a contract,"I went speed dating where I met 13 men over a 2 hr period incl arrival, getting seated and winding up tge event. 

After each 5 minute date, you go on an app and click either Friend, Match or No. I had decided that if I got an 'ick' I would click no but if it was a good convo, I would click friend. I already knew I wasnt clicking match with anyone because I could have a 5 minute conversation with an Aussie Magpie that was fun and amusing. No way known could I experience a match in that time. 

The next day at 8am you get your results. The guys who either clicked friend or match show up with their phone numbers. 

I made a date with one man. Coffee during the day and a walk in a crowded area afterward. 90 minutes and done. 

We talked. It was ok. No sparks, a few silences, a tiny bit of awkwardness but not bad for a first meeting. Then he asks if I'd like to have, ""private fun"" in his car, now. I say, no using a lot more words than that to be polite. He wants to know how many dates until we can do that. I said, its not a timeframe. I have to want to. I try changing the subject.  He brings the subject back to that and calls me conservative, traditional and shy. I am none of these things. I just actually like to actually know a person before having sex with them. 

So, its not 'the worst' date but it is a bad date. I expected over 40's dating to be a little more switched on than teenage dating. 

I dont think Im going to bother speed dating again. Its expensive, & a little exhausting tbh. I found myself carrying the conversations most of the time & I dont want to be pestered for sex by strangers. Thats my idea of a really bad day. ",10,1762558686.0,WomenDatingOverForty,9,0.69,False

*   **Rugged Multi-Tool:** A classic for a reason. A [Leatherman Wave Plus](https://www.leatherman.com/wave-plus.html) has everything he needs for quick fixes on the go, whether he's camping, fishing, or just tinkering in the garage.
*   **Insulated Stainless Steel Cooler:** Forget the flimsy foam cooler. A durable, high-performance cooler from a brand like Yeti or RTIC will keep his drinks icy cold for days on end.

1or9yzn,https://v.redd.it/rfltplhf7xzf1,Notion workspace creating but it’s like application,"This might be controversial, but it needs to be said. The big trend of 2025 is “AI + Bank Syncs.”

It sounds amazing, right? Your finance app “handles everything” for you. The problem?

It leads to a weird paradox: If you don’t use a tracker — you’re uninformed. If you use an “AI tracker” — you’re disinformed.

🤖 The illusion of “smart” That AI has zero context.

It sees a supermarket transaction and calls it “Food.” It doesn’t know if you bought chips, beer, or cleaning supplies.

It sees a P2P transfer and labels it “Gift.” It wasn’t a gift — you were just paying your roommate for utilities.

And the best part? It never sees your cash.

Your balances never match, and the AI just keeps being confidently wrong.

You’re paying a monthly subscription to be lied to politely.

🧍‍♂️ Going manual doesn’t help

So you try manual tracking. But those apps give you a flat list of 30 random tags. How are you supposed to find anything? A search bar? It’s chaos.

You forget to log things, then give up — again.

⚡ Enter Financiaga

It’s a counter-culture.

My philosophy is simple: What you cannot count, you cannot control. And if you “trust the AI,” you’re letting marketing control you.

So I built Financiaga, a Notion-based system designed around context, not automation.

It’s built on two core innovations 👇

🧱 1. The Factory — A 3-Level Tag Tree

“IT guys” will tell you: You can’t have detailed analytics with hundreds of categories. They’re right — because a flat list of 1,000 tags is unusable.

So Financiaga uses a structured 3-level hierarchy:

Food → Snacks → Chips

Now you know exactly what you bought, when, and how often. (Fun math: 10 tags per level isn’t 30 tags — it’s 10×10×10 = 1,000 unique, structured items.)

🧭 2. The Interface — Situational Shortcuts

Three levels sound like a lot to click through, right? Here’s the twist: you almost never do.

You use Situational Shortcuts (Lists) — predefined contexts that capture how you actually live.

“Vacation” → Event Log: record what happened.

“Hike” → Checklist: plan and tick off items.

“Weekdays” → Shortcuts: your recurring daily habits (coffee, bus, lunch, etc.)

This way, the system collects data in linear, natural context. Your life becomes the input — not your transactions.

🧠 The result: real AI, not fake “smart”

When you structure your data like this, you create real intelligence. Now an AI analyst can see your Weekday routines, your Snacks category, and make contextual insights — not blind guesses from a bank sync.

🪞 Final thought

I’ve always loved Bruce Lee’s quote: “I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.”

I don’t want people to fear ten thousand ways to track their spending. I want them to have one way — beautifully designed, logically linear, and perfectly aligned with their life.

I am a first time manager, 23 years old, of a unique place. The most details I can give
for anonymity purposes is that I work for a management company and am the
general manager of a building that houses a coffee shop, brewery, restaurant, and has
event spaces (total of 5). The business is still owned by the original owners (who are
not supposed to be involved but they are having a hard time letting go) and I have 2
directors from my company, one that oversees my operations and the other helps
with R&D. My company took over operations of this business in January.

The reason I am writing is to see what I can do to improve my situation, if there is a
possibility of improvement. I have worked here for 8 months and am burnt out. I
initially thought it was the business plan: how does 1 person actively manage a
coffee shop, brewery, restaurant and also schedule and manage events. After blaming
the business model, I started blaming the size of my team. (17 people) How does one manage 4 streams of revenue while being a present manager to 17 people?

Now, I am wondering if this is a problem with my management. At my 6 month
mark, I sent an email to my 2 directors stating the state of my mental and physical
health (all time low, I am now in therapy) and then offered solutions on how to make
the business more streamlined. I asked for an assistant general manager and to
close one stream of revenue (the restaurant) until my AGM and I can figure out how
to make life easier. They let me pull a kitchen manager out of the kitchen but decided
against my other proposition.

To be frank, I am dying. I want advice on how to survive! Every option my AGM and
I bring up gets shot down because the owners have a specific vision and my
management company is growing rapidly so they don't have many resources to
advocate to us (my director is so wrapped up at another property that our weekly 3 hour meeting has turned into an every-other-week phone call) 

Things that will improve my situation are delegation (my AGM is already
overwhelmed but we cannot afford a second manager) and downsizing my team.
However, I actually need to increase the size of my team because of upcoming events
and to prevent me from covering shifts (this is what put me on my death bed at the 6
month mark).

With advice, I also have a question. I need to know if this is normal for middle
management. Do I need to grow thicker skin or continue advocating for myself about
changes?

I also have a laundry list of special circumstances that make my job worse, please PM
so I can complain!!",3,1762558164.0,managers,2,1.0,False

That heavy, sinking feeling when the map of your life suddenly disappears. You’ve left the job, the relationship ended, or you achieved a major goal only to realize… now what? Everything feels ‘undefined.’

In a culture obsessed with clarity, purpose, and 5-year plans, the undefined state is often treated like a failure—a void that must be filled immediately. We panic, trying to slap a new label onto ourselves just to relieve the anxiety of ambiguity.

But I want you to deeply reflect on this truth: **The undefined state is not a void; it is pure, infinite potential.** It is the single moment in time where you are allowed to be completely stripped of old commitments, identities, and expectations, ready to be written upon anew.

***

### Embracing the Ambiguity: Practical Steps for the Undefined Soul

If you are currently sitting in the 'undefined,' stop running from it and start exploring it. This is where your truest self is waiting to be built, brick by conscious brick.

**1. Define by Exclusion (The Anti-To-Do List):** 
When you don't know what you want, start by definitively identifying what you *don't* want. What old behaviors, environments, or relationships were actively draining your energy? Defining your boundaries and eliminating what no longer serves you creates necessary emotional space. Clarity often arrives by subtraction, not addition.

**2. Practice Low-Stakes Experimentation:**
Stop treating every decision in the undefined phase as a lifetime commitment. Instead, treat this time like research. Try that weird hobby. Take that random short course. Say yes to the coffee invitation with a person outside your usual network. These are not final definitions; they are *data points*. You are gathering information about what lights you up and what quickly fizzles out. There is zero pressure to commit forever.

**3. Focus on the Process, Not the Outcome:**
The definition (the 'answer') will eventually come. But the growth happens in the *process*—in the mindful choice of how you spend your time today. What small, regenerative action can you take in the next hour? Read. Walk. Write down three things you are curious about. When you focus on small, consistent acts of self-care and curiosity, the bigger definition starts to organically bubble up. 

Your assignment isn't to be defined right now; your assignment is to be brave enough to sit in the discomfort of becoming. Trust that the architecture for your next great chapter is being built right now, even if the blueprint is still blurry.",1,1762557848.0,Empowish,0,1.0,False

Locker - it’s is a kinda new app/website where you can organize everything you want to buy from diff sites in one place. Pretty good at finding best price for big purchases.  
Refundly - a super new app but has been helping me track when I send things back and let’s me know if I haven’t gotten my money back.

1or9d50,https://www.reddit.com/r/prozac/comments/1or9d50/adderall_and_prozac/,adderall and prozac?,"I’ve been taking Adderall along with Prozac lately. It wasn’t always like this — for about two months, I was only on Prozac just to see how I’d respond. Before that, I was on Lexapro, and honestly, it made me feel like the worst version of myself.

While I was on Lexapro, I started noticing ADHD-like symptoms showing up more than usual. I know a lot of people can relate to that, but it felt more intense for me — I couldn’t focus, had zero motivation, and felt tired all day. I’d spend money carelessly and get absolutely nothing done.

I work in the medical field, so I have to be really sharp and precise. I deal with patient information and need to be focused to avoid mistakes. When I started Celexa, though, I was slipping up a lot. It made me so drowsy and disconnected — like I was just going through the motions without thinking twice.

I also work in education, so focus is important there too. I ended up taking some time off my main job and cutting hours at the second one because I didn’t want to make things worse. I was on Celexa for about two months (June–July), took leave mid-July, and switched to Lexapro in August. But after two weeks, I switched again to Prozac because Lexapro wasn’t any better — I had more anxiety, sweats, and overall just hated how it made me feel.

At first, Prozac hit me weird. I’d randomly cry at night for no reason, but I knew that could be part of the side effects, so I just rode it out. After about a month (around September), I started feeling better — not completely fine, but the depression came in waves instead of all the time.

When I went back to work, I had a lot to catch up on and needed to “lock in.” I work about 14-hour days (except Mondays, my only day off). Around that time, I started Adderall — beginning at just 5mg. I’d read that Prozac can slow down how your body breaks down Adderall, and I’m pretty sure that’s true because even 5mg hit me hard.

Fast forward to now — I’m taking 100mg of Adderall daily, sometimes with a cup of coffee. Lately, I’ve been feeling kind of emotionally numb. Not robotic, but not as empathetic or emotionally present as I used to be. I have a partner, and I try my best to make sure they feel loved, heard, and understood, even if I feel distant sometimes.

I don’t think Prozac and Adderall have had any major negative interactions for me, and I’m on 20mg of Prozac. I can function fine on just Prozac during slower days, but when I know work’s going to be intense, I take Adderall so I can stay on point and productive.

This is my first time ever writing a post like this, so sorry if it’s long. I’d just love to hear others’ thoughts or experiences with combining Prozac and Adderall. also can i get prescribed adderall with my prozac??

I'm 22F and have not gone to college. I'm really struggling to figure out what to do with my life and I don't want to waste any more time doing nothing.

I'm currently a security guard and I have come to hate it. The only thing I like about my job right now is doing searches/tasks on our profile database and issuing badges. There's no flexibility and I feel the amount of pressure I put on myself in the beginning has caused a bit of burnout. I know this isn't what I want to do with my life.

I do digital art which I LOVE doing, I've considered being a graphic novelist, doing niche work for visual novels, commissions, but this is something I'd have to work on in my personal time. I also LOVE the idea of being in a field concerning videogame development, a field combining both art and game development sounds so cool. But fields in these interests are super competitive and many times unstable. I want to be stable but it's also hard to trade that for doing something I don't love as much, and frankly, I am afraid to pursue these things.

School is an issue for me because I fear the student debt a lot... I don't wanna jump into something just to realize I've wasted all this time and money for no reason. Since I've graduated high school I've been trying to figure things out away from college but there's a lot that would be so cool to learn, and I feel backed into a corner a bit.

I often see the employees of the company I do security for doing their work in cubicles but they have access to food, warm coffee, the ability to go out for lunch, it's quiet and most don't have to come in until 8 am. I feel like they can take care of their needs without guilt, but for me in certain situations I feel so guilty even for taking a break. 

It's so funny because as a kid I told myself I'd never take a 9-5 office job. But now that looks luxurious to me. I'm wondering if something calm and quiet would work well while I grow my art skills and learn coding. I just don't know how to get there as I seem underqualified for every job. I need ideas (and to vent lol) but I don't know how or where to start and I'm just so tired. I want a better life. I'd love some advice from anyone who can give some.

TLDR: I need a career that's calm and stable, OR something that would have to do with my passions like art, but I'm scared. It feels like everything I want to do would make me financially unstable for over a decade (or ever).",3,1762556874.0,careerguidance,4,1.0,False

At all. I’ve driven 2 hours and am parked a few streets from my exes house. I miss this town. In a way it’s bittersweet and partly healing.

My ex has blocked me on everything and I don’t want to be that psycho ex, but I have this urge that’s so overwhelming to just see him. To try talk to him. Even if I know it’s stupid and crossing boundaries. I’ve sat with this consistent feeling, the wave of this urge for weeks now. But cannot pinpoint exactly what I am after. Closure? Maybe another chance? I just miss him like crazy and would do anything to fix what we had.

I’ve written a very long letter that is both an apology, thankyou and a bit of closure and explanation of how I am working towards a secure attachment style and improving myself. I’ve read it back so many times, my mum and best friend have also and think it’s well written and honest. 

My ex is a very emotional person and the last interaction we had he said he still cared for me a lot. When I told him I loved him he responded saying “I don’t think I love you anymore. But I love lots of things about you”. It’s been about 6 weeks NC and I’m honestly struggling with the idea of letting go of hope. We’ve broken up before, but got back together about 3 months later.

Do I drop off the letter and not knock? Do I post it instead so he doesn’t know I’ve been in his town? Do I knock? Do I text his sister and ask if she can ask if he’d be willing to have coffee (I’m still on good terms with his sister and I think she’s pretty aware of how upset I’ve been)?

1or98uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1or98uq/whats_the_right_backpacking_stove_for_windy/,What's the right backpacking stove for windy conditions?,"Hey everyone,

So I've been camping and hiking for about five years now, and one thing that used to drive me absolutely crazy was trying to cook breakfast on a mountain ridge while the wind basically laughed at my little stove. If you've ever crouched over your gear trying to shield a flickering flame with your body while your water refuses to boil, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

After way too many cold dinners and half-cooked ramen, I finally figured out what actually works in windy conditions.

**The Windscreen Makes or Breaks Everything**

First things first - a built-in windscreen is not optional. Those tiny portable camping stoves with zero wind protection? Forget about it. You need something with actual walls around the burner. Some canister stoves come with folding windscreens, and those are decent. But the best performing option I've found are stoves with integrated wind protection that wraps around the entire cooking area.

**Canister vs Liquid Fuel**

I know liquid fuel stoves look old school, but hear me out. They perform way better in harsh weather compared to regular canister stoves. The problem with canister stoves is that cold weather and wind can mess with the pressure, making them super inefficient. Liquid fuel stoves like white gas models don't have that issue.

That said, I still use canister stoves most of the time because they're lighter and easier. You just need to pick the right one.

**What I Actually Recommend**

If you're shopping around, look for these features:

- Integrated wind protection or a good windscreen
- Low profile design (sits closer to the ground)
- Wider burner head for stability
- Piezo ignition as backup

I've tried probably eight different backpacking stoves over the years, and I've found that going with a quality model makes all the difference. If you want to check out some solid options that actually work in windy spots, I'd recommend looking at [these backpacking stoves](https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove) that are built for tough conditions.

**Quick Tips That Helped Me**

Beyond just having the right stove, here's what works:

Find natural windbreaks when you set up camp. Cooking behind a large rock or fallen tree changes everything. I also carry aluminum foil to make an emergency windscreen if needed - just be careful not to wrap it around canister stoves since they need ventilation.

Keep your fuel warm. I sleep with my fuel canister in my sleeping bag on cold trips. Sounds weird, but warm fuel = better performance.

Lower your pot. The closer your cookware sits to the flame, the less wind interference you get.

**Bottom Line**

Don't cheap out on your cooking system if you camp in exposed areas. A unreliable stove means cold food, wasted fuel, and a pretty miserable experience. I learned this the hard way on a trip in the Rockies where I literally couldn't get water to boil for coffee. Never again.

You can browse different models and read reviews at [this link](https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove) to find something that fits your budget and camping style.

Stay warm out there, and may your water actually boil on the first try.",1,1762556707.0,ProductAmazon,0,1.0,False

See ""decor\_items"" parameter  in [https://api-docs.decor8.ai/#operation/generateDesignsForRoom](https://api-docs.decor8.ai/#operation/generateDesignsForRoom) 

The idea is simple:

Provide a list of furniture item images from your catalog, give them simple names like ""sofa"", ""coffee table"", ""painting or picture frame"" and optional text prompt in case you want to precisely control where the items should be placed. If you don't provide the prompt, the API will place them considering the input room\_type (Living Room / Bedroom etc)

Here is a sample that places 6 items in an empty room to create a living room.

AI furniture Placement is great for:

* Furniture and Home Décor Retail Stores who want to help their customers visualize how specific items will look into their homes.
* Interior designer who want to place items from their catalog into the designs instead of generic ones from the internet
* Virtual staging companies who want to utilize proven/ battle tested furniture items from their catalog.

1. **Go to where people are.** It sounds obvious, but if you don't go outside, you won't meet anyone. I chose the gym and university. You can pick libraries, hobby clubs, coffee shops, bars, any social event. Recurring places like classes or work make it easier, but it's not necessary.

We hung out after classes, and eventually she invited me out with her other friends. Meeting new people through her was much easier since she introduced us. Sometimes you need to meet 2-3 people before this happens, but once you do, things get easier.
3. **Invite the new people.** Invite them to group dinners, parties, picnics, game nights. Ask them to bring friends. When you invite people and they enjoy it, they'll start inviting you to their events. At their events, you meet more new people, and you can keep inviting them too.
4. **Become a connector.** Once you know enough people, start introducing them to each other. This makes them like and care about you more. If you find someone naturally extroverted who likes going out, they'll meet people for you and introduce you to them.
5. **Repeat.** Anytime you meet someone new, introduce them to this system. Invite them, they bring friends or invite you back, you meet new people, and repeat.

I want to emphasize that I started from scratch, and that you just need to talk to one person to start. The scariest part is talking to the first person, but after that it gets easier. 

I didn't wait for perfect friendships before inviting people or accepting invites. At the start, it's more about volume than quality. When you meet enough people, you'll naturally find those you resonate with. In my case, I met way more than 28 people, but those 28 became actual friends. Eventually by doing this enough, I reached a point where I don't have to approach strangers anymore, because my friends introduce me to new people constantly.

So just start. **Start with one single person**, even if it's scary. I hope this post inspires you to do so. I'm the happiest I found the courage to talk to my classmate, it changed my life. I believe you can change yours too.

I'm happy to answer any questions if this brought any up.",11,1762556542.0,socialskills,2,1.0,False
1or9693,https://i.redd.it/1kec4p7a0xzf1.png,Short Narrative: Carla’s Wake-Up Call,"A Dad, Sean, 38, and his partner wife Diana, 39, sat across from each other at the kitchen table — two beautiful people who had somehow lost their way. Between them sat their daughter, Carla, eleven years old, sharp, witted, spunky, and far wiser than her years show.

Sean cleared his throat. “Sweetheart, your mom and I need to talk to you about something important.”

Carla looked up, sensing the gravity in his tone. “You’re not breaking up, are you?”

Neither parent spoke. That silence was all the answer she needed. Her eyes widened, and before either could respond, she shot up from her chair.

With Fire in her eyes “No! You will *not* do that to me,” she said, her small voice trembling but fierce. “I deserve better — and so do you both!”

Sean blinked, stunned. Diana opened her mouth, but Carla was on a roll and they had no choice but hear her out.

“The minute life gets hard, you just give up! What happened to ‘I’ll love your mom forever’? And you, Mom — didn’t you say, ‘I’ll love your father till the day I die’? Are you dying, Mom, are you?”

The room went silent. Neither parent had ever heard her like this.

“You both say you love me,” Carla continued, “but you’re teaching me the wrong things — to quit when things get tough. You say nothing will change, but everything *is* changing! Where’s my security? How can you think of yourselves and not what this will do to me?”

Tears welled in her eyes. “You’re shaking the very foundation I’m standing on. I want and I need both my mom and dad — not two people who gave up on each other.”

She took a shaky breath, wiped her tears, and stood tall. “Now you two sit here and think about what you’re doing to *us*. I’m going to my room.”

Carla turned, walked down the hall, and shut her door. Behind it, she collapsed onto her bed and sobbed.

Back in the kitchen, Sean and Diana sat frozen. For the first time in months, they looked at each other — really looked.

Sean lowered his head. “She’s right.”

Diana nodded slowly. “For her sake… let’s figure out what got us here. We’ve been living separate lives, barely talking.”

“It started with small things,” Sean said quietly. “No dinners together. You watched TV, I was always online. We stopped talking unless Carla was in the room.”

Diana’s voice softened. “That went on for months.”

Sean met her eyes. “You know, I never stopped loving you. Or Carla.”

Her lips trembled. “I still love you too. I thought you didn’t.”

“I thought *you* didn’t,” he admitted, half smiling through tears.

“Why didn’t you say something?”

“For the same reason you didn’t.”

Diana let out a small, broken laugh. Then both of them stood and embraced — a long, wordless hug that said everything they hadn’t in months.

When they finally sat down again, Sean took her hand. “Let’s fix this — really fix it. For her. For us.”

Diana nodded. “No more silence. No more drifting apart.”

They promised to start small — dinners together, honest talks, family outings — rebuilding not just their marriage, but the home that held it.

Later that night, when Carla peeked out from her room, she found her parents laughing softly in the kitchen, holding hands over empty coffee cups.

For the first time in a long time, she smiled — the kind of smile that said love hadn’t left after all.",1,1762556526.0,ShortNarrative,0,1.0,False

I’m an E-5 cyber troop, single, been in 7 years. Just rotated home from the Deid and I need to scream into the void because WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THIS PAY GAP.

Contractors out there are clearing $150k TAX-FREE doing *maybe* 25% of the work I do. That’s $190k equivalent in the real world. Meanwhile I’m pulling $72k before Uncle Sam takes his cut, barely enough to give my family the life they deserve.

Let’s break down my “single” job, shall:

1. Supervise 6 Airmen while writing EPRs that eat WEEKS of my life  
2. Manage every network node on the entire base (yes, the same ones contractors are paid to maintain)  
3. Update 3-year-old documentation because the contractors “aren’t contracted for that”  
4. Track crypto keys like I’m guarding the nuclear football  
5. Fix DTS for my entire shop because God forbid anyone else learns how  
6. Run helpdesk because their contract magically excludes “trouble tickets”  
7. Get called in at 0200 for emergencies while contractors sleep in their $0 rent dorms  
8. Additional duties? I’m everyone’s backup plan.

And what do I get for dinner? Contractors **bragging** about their new boats, Vegas trips, and “early retirement” while I’m rationing leave days to see my kid’s birthday.

These same civilians have **never worn the uniform**, never dealt with a shirt telling them to “just make it work,” never had to choose between fixing a router or finishing an LOC before COB. But they’re out here living like **E-9s with 20** while I’m scraping by on **E-5 with 4 side hustles worth of labor.**

Oh, and get this—their contracts went up ~30% since 2021. My raise? 2. something percent and a participation trophy. Government shutdown? Their money’s already in the bank. EU contractors? $130k+ tax-free now too.

I’m not saying contractors shouldn’t make money. I’m saying **I’m doing THEIR job + MINE + 3 OTHERS** for **less than half** what they pocket. Who the hell writes these contracts? Because I’d like to introduce them to the **real world** of 12-hour shifts, zero OT, and “voluntold” details.

I love the mission. I love my Airmen. But watching civilians cash in on our blood and weekends while leadership shrugs? That’s a **slap in the face** with a tax-free paycheck.

Rant over. Back to rewriting 2022’s cable inventory because the contractor “wasn’t told to.”

**TL;DR: E-5 doing 4 jobs for $72k, contractors do 1 for $150k tax-free. Cool system.**

Upvote if you’ve ever fixed a contractor’s mess at 3am.

  
Downvote if you’re a contractor reading this on your yacht.

Edit 1

Oh yeah, almost forgot the cherry on this shit-sundae: we lost our SRB too.
Used to be a 1x, then they bumped it to a 2x like they were doing us a favor… now? Zero. Nada. Zilch.
Leadership: “We need to retain talent!”
Also leadership: takes away the one financial carrot we had
Everything’s gatekept just enough to dangle hope—“work hard, make rank, get the bonus!”—then YOINK, gone. Feels like a rigged game to keep enlisted grinding while the exit door’s welded shut.
At this point? Eject button’s looking real shiny. Why bleed for a system that won’t even pretend to value you?


Edit 2

And don’t even get me started on EITaaS—that corporate circle-jerk disguised as “innovation.”
Go look at their LinkedIn. It’s cringe on steroids. A parade of greedy-ass companies posting glossy graphics bragging about “revolutionary” capabilities that enlisted have been doing with duct tape and spite since 2012.
“We’ve integrated remote desktop!” → Bro, it’s 2025, not 2003.
“Our AI chatbot resolves tickets 47% faster!” → Cool, meanwhile I’m the 24/7 human chatbot for free.
Then you’ve got the try-hard corporate bootlickers flooding the comments:
“So grateful to partner with EITaaS—truly transforming the mission! 🙏💼”
Translation: “Please renew our $400M contract, here’s my tongue, sir.”
They’re out here vendor-locking the Air Force with million-dollar slide decks while we’re cheaper than the coffee budget and still expected to unfuck their “solutions” at 0200.

1or91gy,https://i.redd.it/99iz4j5i0xzf1.jpeg,PSA - While In Kathmandu - from the management,"Hello from While In Kathmandu, there is a lot of chatter going around & thought it was important to talk to the community directly 🌿

The image above reflects back to the original plan of what while in kathmandu  was meant to be when we first opened. We seek to finally become what we always envisioned for this venue or atleast make the full effort towards the vision. 

We’ve been overwhelmed by the outpouring of concern and support over the past few days after we put out the message that we are throwing in the towel for the current service hours & menu - thank you all so much. We’d like to take a moment to clarify a few things.

Yes, we are making some major changes: we’re stepping away from our current hours, menu, and business model. However, we are not closing. What we’ve been doing for the past nine years no longer aligns with today’s economic realities, evolving dining habits, increasing neighborhood options, and rising costs of goods and services.

For years, we managed to keep things going because we were extremely busy. But since last year, the landscape has changed significantly. After careful reflection, we realized that if we continue with the same model, we risk losing the establishment entirely—so change is necessary, and now is the time.

What to Expect

Our goal is to return to the original vision of While In Kathmandu: a Nepali café and bar, just as we imagined it nine years ago.

Phase One: Menu & Hours Restructure
We’ll begin with a smaller lunch menu. In the past, we offered many dinner dishes throughout the day, but moving forward, lunch and dinner will have distinct menus. The dinner menu will also be streamlined—not because we can’t handle more, but because we want to build a more efficient and sustainable kitchen operation.

Our kitchen was originally designed for a bar and tapas-style menu, but our current setup often pushes it beyond capacity, leading to slower service and unnecessary stress during peak hours. Simplifying our offerings will allow us to provide a smoother dining experience.

Phase Two: Strengthening the Bar Program
We plan to operate a full bar with a strong focus on crafted cocktails featuring Nepali liquors and ingredients, complemented by live music after dinner service. This shift will not only enhance the experience for our guests but will also help balance food and labor costs through increased beverage sales.

Phase Three: Bringing Back the Café
If these changes bring positive results, we hope to reopen our morning café hours. This would allow us to operate with multiple teams, creating a more dynamic, stable, and enjoyable environment for both our staff and our guests.

How You Can Help
We don’t ask for much—just your continued support. Please come in and enjoy our current hours and menu during this transition period. Your patronage directly supports our renovation and growth efforts.

We also want to be transparent: as we evolve, some prices will increase due to higher costs and the introduction of new concepts. We understand that we may lose some customers who prefer our older menu or pricing, but we hope our community will embrace these changes and grow with us. Every visit, every meal, and every drink helps us move toward a more sustainable and exciting future.

A Note from the Owner

A little story—When I first opened While In Kathmandu, it was 4 a.m. when I decided I couldn’t wait any longer for my liquor license and just went for a soft opening. I kept telling myself we’d have a proper grand opening once everything was ready, but we got busy, and the food side of things took off faster than expected.
Now, I finally hope to bring that long-delayed grand opening to life—this time, with the full vision realized.  

We’re not closing, and we’re not giving up. We’re simply evolving before it’s too late to do so. Thank you to everyone who has supported, believed in, and celebrated us over the years. Your appreciation truly fuels what we do.
Since 2012, our family has operated three restaurants in this neighborhood—Nepalese Indian Restaurant (2012–2022), While In Kathmandu (2016–2025), and Fresh Pond Spice (2016–2019). This community is our home, and we have no intention of leaving it. ❤️
