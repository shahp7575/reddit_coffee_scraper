Every cameo, from a perfectly framed reflection to an extended scene where he wordlessly interacts with a stressed-out hero, adds a layer of surreal charm and implies a deep, complex backstory we never fully uncover. He’s the perfect blend of absurdity and normalcy, and every time the cat suit shows up, you know you're in for a delightful moment of character-driven strangeness.

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip.

1p0meic,https://www.reddit.com/r/excoc/comments/1p0meic/an_excoc_friend_posted_this_written_by_benjamin/,"An ex-coc friend posted this, written by Benjamin Cremer.  I don't know who he is, but he's on to something here.","I recently overheard a conversation at a coffee shop where all the tired stereotypes about people who are “deconstructing” their Christian faith were treated as self-evident truths. 

The assumption was that anyone wrestling with questions must be looking for an excuse to deny God’s Word. That if they are doubtful now, they must never have had real faith to begin with. That their questions are merely a gateway to sin. That anyone who steps back from their church community must never have been a true believer.

In my ministry and in my own story I have not found a single one of those stereotypes to be true. What I have found is that these assumptions nearly always come from fear, defensiveness, and a need to demonize those who are navigating genuinely painful and complicated realities in an effort to “defend the church.” When people feel threatened, they often create caricatures rather than listen to real human beings.

When you think you need to protect the church from people, that is when you can be sure that you’ve forgotten that people are the church.

After all, God chose the name “Israel” to rename Jacob, which means “one who wrestles with God.” God isn’t threatened by our questions, critiques, or wrestlings. It is often those who feel the need to protect God from people who are wrestling that feel threatened.

Every person’s journey with doubt and deconstruction is different. Some reach the end of their questions and conclude that Christianity is no longer the spiritual home they hoped it could be. I honor those stories, even when they lead to places I wouldn’t choose myself. I believe every story needs to be listened to and learned from.

But far more often, I’ve found that people who are deconstructing or untangling their faith are not trying to escape Jesus, they are trying to remain committed to Jesus. They are trying to reconcile what they are witnessing from their faith communities and the teachings of Jesus. Their questions are not about rejecting Christianity but about questioning the way Christianity has been weaponized, politicized, and distorted to justify harm, exclusion, and abuse. They aren’t rejecting Jesus’ teachings. They are resisting the ways Jesus’ teachings have been ignored.

What many critics of deconstruction fail to imagine is the trauma of watching the very community that taught you the way of Jesus abandon that way in exchange for political power. They cannot fathom what it’s like to be called a heretic or a socialist simply for taking Jesus at His word. They do not consider how disorienting it is when a church that once shaped your faith slowly pledges its allegiance to ideologies that look nothing like the kingdom of God and then insists it is still being faithful to Jesus.

And then, when you finally speak honestly about your disillusionment, you are told that you are the unfaithful one. You are told that you are the doubter. That you are the problem. Not the leaders who betrayed the faith they taught you. Not the institutions that traded the Sermon on the Mount for the flag and pursuit of influence. You are blamed for simply refusing to call darkness light.

For many people I have spoken with and in my own life as well, the experience of deconstruction was not a rebellion against Jesus but the painful recognition that our faith communities had already walked away from Him. They abandoned Jesus and in doing so abandoned us.

Many of us are still grieving the wounds we received from being abandoned or even betrayed by our faith communities. It is like grieving the loss of someone close, but doing so isolated and alone, because the community you once grieved with is gone.

What is also taken for granted by those who criticize questions and critique towards our faith traditions is that these are often done from a place of love, not hate. Speaking for myself, the very reason I write and speak is because I love the church. I believe Jesus called ordinary people to be the church and when those people embody the teachings of Jesus, it creates a beloved community that can be capable of such incredible healing and peace in the world. If I didn’t believe this, I wouldn’t do this work.

The truth is, asking hard questions is not faithlessness. Refusing to participate in hypocrisy is not sin. Naming the ways the church has betrayed its calling is not rebellion. It is a form of faithfulness. Simply read the psalms and the prophets. Sometimes the most faithful thing a person can do is refuse to pretend. This I believe is the heart of the prophets in scripture, who loved their people so much and they risked their very lives to call them back to the way of love, peace, mercy, and justice. They called them back to the ways of God.

For many, deconstruction is not the end of faith. It is honesty that things are not as they should be. And honesty is where healing, real, Spirit-led healing, begins.

My prayer is that we would learn to meet those who are deconstructing not with suspicion or fear, but with the same compassion Jesus extends to every person who comes to Him with wounded hearts and honest questions. And may the Church recover enough humility to see that sometimes the people we accuse of “walking away” are the ones still trying the most to remain close to Jesus.",2,1763496454.0,excoc,1,1.0,False

A couple of months ago, I noticed a man in our company communications. His name caught my attention because it’s from close to my country, and I’d always been curious about him — who he is, how he got where he is. I kind of saw him as a role model, a life aspiration, maybe even a potential mentor. I added him on LinkedIn long before he became a VP.

He works in a different location from me.

After a lot of internal discussions with colleagues/friends about my career, I finally reached out to him and said I’d be interested in working in his area and his location. I sent him an email, and he immediately invited me to meet him when he was visiting my office.

The first time we met, everything clicked, he was very friendly with me. He offered me a position immediately on the spot, introduced me to his network, and over the weekend I even received messages from his direct reports saying he had talked about me. He also suggested we can go for lunch or dinner while he’s around. 

We met a second time before he flew back to his location.

During that meeting, he gave me his personal number “in case I needed help with accommodation,” kissed me on the cheeks hello and goodbye, and asked about my personal situation — specifically whether I was single. He apologized about cancelling the dinner and said he just didn’t have time.

After that, we had a couple of online catch-ups. He wanted to speed up my move to his location. Then he visited my office again unexpectedly, when he saw me, he literally shouted my name across the floor and came straight to me to say hi, kissing me on the cheeks again.

Meanwhile, I started working with one of his direct reports, but things are going badly (micromanagement, contract issues, etc.) even though I’m doing good work. I feel miserable and stressed, and I can’t imagine how this will be if I actually move overseas.

Last Friday, I ran into him again by chance. 
He asked me to grab coffee. We talked, and he made it very clear that if I needed anything, he would help- even if it involved money. He also opened up about his personal life (divorced, has a child, ex lives in the same country). I booked a trip to visit his location and he had to approve the expense and he suggested that he wanted us to travel together but wasn’t sure he could, so he didn’t. He told me he’ll show me around once I’m there (even though I am sure he won’t have this time). 

He’s… very protective of me. He reassured me during the conversation. He even said he could reassure my parents because of the stress I mentioned -it was a joke but he always like to ask about my parents… I feel good around him - like he genuinely cares. And I can’t lie, I’m starting to feel attracted to him.

But I’m confused because I don’t understand his intentions. The whole situation is a mix of personal and professional lines being blurred. He’s a VP. I’m just starting my new role. And yet he behaves in ways that feel very personal.

1p0mdgt,https://i.redd.it/y9jt3an5o22g1.jpeg,Paula Truong allegedly killed her entire family before taking her own life,"Californian woman Paula Truong and her husband Thomas Ocheltree lived in a multi-million dollar home in San Francisco.  They had two beautiful daughters, Alexandra (12) and Mackenzie (9), and seemed to be living an idyllic lifestyle.

Under the surface, things weren’t as they seemed.  The couple had multiple failed businesses including a group of coffee shops that closed down.  They had also attempted to transform a local deli into an upmarket liquor store and that venture also failed.

In October 2025, their home had been foreclosed upon and they had hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt.

On October 6, Thomas’ brother Robert went to the home to see the family as he could not get in touch with his brother.  Paula came out of the home and did not invite him in, which he thought was strange.   All of the curtains were closed. Paula said that Thomas was on his way home from a golf tournament and that he had lost his phone, which explained why nobody could get in touch with him. 

Two days after this, Robert went back to the home and broke in.  He discovered the bodies of the four family members.  

The two girls were found in their beds and had suffered gunshot wounds.  Both girls had sedatives and other substances in their systems.  Thomas was also found with gunshot wounds and was discovered with the weapon in his hand.  Paula was found h*nging in the garage.   

Following an investigation by the medical examiner, it was determined that Paula was the perpetrator and that she had likely placed the weapon in Thomas’ hand.

I’ve been using a Breville Barista Express for a couple of years now. When I first bought it, I wasn’t sure how much I’d enjoy espresso, but as you all know, it’s a slippery slope, and I’m neck deep.

However, I’m feeling frustrated with the consistency of the Barista Express and the fact that I can’t steam milk and pull shots simultaneously. Additionally, I find it takes a long time to steam milk.

I’m seriously considering upgrading to a dual boiler or heat exchanger but I’m aware that means I’ll also need to buy a separate grinder.

I’m also considering an Apartmentto, but I’m not sure about grinders. I’m not committed to this idea and would be open to other machines. I’ve noticed that places like Seattle Coffee sell machines and grinders together, which seems like a good deal. Is it?

But hear me out. I’m a Midwesterner born & raised. Have lived in pretty much every region of the US for certain stretches of time. I moved to CT last summer, and this is my first venture into New England/East Coast. 

You guys take your pizza seriously here. Some might say you’re downright snobby about it. But I totally get it! You have every right to be. I’ve never been some place that has more pizza places than coffee shops or churches. And they’re all varying levels of good-to-great. Personal favorite is Modern, then Colony (I know I know, that’s not actually apizza or anything), and Roseland rounds out my top 3. 

Anyway, with so many great local spots, there’s a massive gap in the “cheap, shitty, National chain” market. Except for Dominos. I live in the Valley and work in Waterbury. In that little section of the state; there are multiple Domino’s. Which I appreciate. My first job as a teenager in IL was Dominos. It’s cheap, it’s fast, it tastes like home. However, that’s it. There’s no Pizza Hut (there was a personal size one inside the Target next to work, but it was remodeled and removed). There’s no Godfathers. There’s no Mario’s. There’s no Hungry Howies. There’s no Little Ceasars (I know there are some in certain parts of the state like Bridgeport). There’s no CiCis. 

My question is…why? Understandably so, you don’t NEED them. I get it. When you have some of the best pizza in the world at your disposal, why even care about shitty big name chains? Well sometimes you just want a shitty cheeseburger and not the most expensive steak. I’m sure I’m not the only person who moved to CT from other parts of the country that have nostalgic cravings from time to time. So what it is about Dominos that breaks through? Why is that the one national chain that is successful and welcomed in these parts? ",2,1763496130.0,Connecticut,10,0.75,False

The Dallas Stars and New York Islanders are set to collide on November 18, 2025, in a game that promises to be as chaotic as a toddler’s birthday party—only with fewer confetti cannons and more slapshots. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why the Stars are about to make the Islanders wish they’d brought an umbrella for this storm.

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Stars Are the Shrewd Bet

The Stars (-168) are heavy favorites at home, where they’ve scored 3.3 goals per game (6th in the NHL) and allowed a miserly 2.2 goals per game over their last 10 contests. Their +9 goal differential (5th in the league) isn’t just a stat—it’s a middle finger to the concept of “balanced hockey.” Meanwhile, the Islanders (+141) are a solid underdog story, but their defense looks like a sieve left in a hurricane. New York allows 2.7 goals per game (19th in the league), and their +1 differential is about as reliable as a toaster oven during a blackout.

The over/under is set at 6 goals, but the teams’ combined average of 6.5 goals per game suggests this could be a fireworks show. However, the computer projection of 6.3 goals (just under the line) hints at a tight-checking game—unless the Islanders’ porous defense decides to take a coffee break.

### Injury Report: Dallas’ “Absent Friends” and New York’s “Who’s That Guy?”

Dallas is missing key pieces like Jamie Benn and Matt Duchene, who are currently “enjoying a spontaneous daycation” from the ice. But the Stars have depth to rival a Russian nesting doll—Rantanen (26 points) and Robertson (23 points) are firing on all cylinders, while Jake Oett

1p0m5n5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NiceVancouver/comments/1p0m5n5/sunrise_over_commercial_drive/,Sunrise Over Commercial Drive,"I was walking down Commercial Drive just after sunrise today, the kind of cold autumn morning where you can see your breath but the sky is turning that soft pink that makes you forget you’re shivering. I had grabbed a coffee from a little café that had just opened its doors, and as I stepped back outside I noticed an older man struggling to unload crates of vegetables from a small delivery van. The boxes were stacked almost to his shoulders and he was clearly fighting the incline of the sidewalk.

Before I even had time to think, two different people stopped and offered to help him. One was a student still wearing pajama pants under a long coat and the other looked like he was heading to work on his bike but didn’t hesitate to hop off. They didn’t know each other, didn’t ask questions, they just jumped in. In less than a minute the crates were carried into the tiny grocery store and the owner stood there grinning, thanking everyone like they had just saved his whole day.

What really got me was what happened after. Instead of everyone rushing off, the student asked the owner where the vegetables came from and he began telling this whole story about a family farm in Abbotsford that he has been buying from for years. He talked about how the recent heavy rain had made harvesting difficult and how he thought this might be one of the last shipments before winter really set in. It turned into this small, warm moment on a chilly street where a handful of strangers were suddenly talking like old friends.

I stood there listening while the steam from my coffee drifted into the morning air, and for the first time in a while I felt that sense of quiet connection that Vancouver sometimes hides but never really loses. It reminded me that the city isn’t just buildings and traffic and endless construction. It is these little pockets of kindness that appear exactly when they are needed, often without anyone planning it.

Walking away, I couldn’t stop thinking about how easy it had been for three strangers to make someone’s morning a little easier, and how those moments add up. On days when the city feels too busy or too cold or too expensive, this is the stuff that keeps it human.",0,1763495916.0,NiceVancouver,1,0.33,False

Sorry if this is a dumb question lol. 

My border collie baby is 3 months old, and I've had him since he was 8 weeks. Ever since he came home, he's LOVED squeezing himself under my furniture (like, under my bed, under couches, coffee table, etc)

It doesn't seem like an unhealthy habit or something fear-based, he just enjoys squishing into small spaces to take naps and eat his chew sticks.

The problem is that he's getting bigger, and he can't fit under most of my furniture anymore. I can tell it bothers him, and it also really restricts where in my home he is willing to hang out because most rooms don't have furniture that works for him.

Do any of you guys have border collies that do the same thing, and have you tried any products/diy setups that they like? Like, elevated dog beds or some kind of pillow fort? Maybe one of those children's play tents? 

Thanks!

Every semester there’s at least one week where everything hits at once exams, essays, discussion posts, projects, whatever. That’s exactly how I ended up testing PapersRoo. This is my honest **PapersRoo review**, what actually happened when I ordered from them, and whether **PapersRoo** is legit or just another aesthetic-looking site with mid-tier results. Also: why I ended up switching to Killer Papers instead (aka my academic life-saver).


**TL;DR**: PapersRoo is technically “fine,” but the essay I got back felt rushed and super generic. Not terrible, but definitely not something I’d trust for a big assignment. Killer Papers was a night-and-day upgrade.

**Why I Even Took a Chance on PapersRoo**

It was one of those weeks where my brain just fully clocked out. I had a research paper due in 24 hours, two quizzes, and I was basically living off iced coffee and panic.

I Googled “best essay writing service” and PapersRoo popped up a bunch. Cute branding, decent prices, lots of big promises. In my sleep-deprived state, I was like, “Yeah sure, this looks legit.”

Narrator: It was… kinda legit. Just not good.


**My Actual Experience Using PapersRoo**

Ordering was smooth. I gave them the prompt, the rubric, my sources, and paid.

The paper they delivered wasn’t awful… but it wasn’t something I could turn in without serious edits. Here were the main issues:

+ The writing felt **weirdly generic**, like someone wrote it without fully understanding the topic

+ A couple sentences legit sounded like they were pulled straight from a SparkNotes summary

+ The arguments were shallow like “surface-level analysis pretending to be deep” energy

+ The conclusion was literally three sentences and one was a repeat of the intro

+ Formatting? Half APA, half vibes.

I asked for a revision, hoping it would tighten things up. They did fix a few wording issues, but nothing about the deeper problems changed. The paper still felt like something written on autopilot.

I ended up rewriting about 40% of it myself because I was not about to risk turning in something that bland for a research-heavy class.

**What Happened When I Switched to Killer Papers**

After the whole PapersRoo fiasco, I asked around on Reddit and kept seeing Killer Papers recommended. People were saying their writers were legit North American and don’t outsource or use AI.

So I tried them and honestly, it was like switching from McDonald’s to an actual restaurant.

My writer asked thoughtful questions about the assignment, tone, class level, and even offered to look at my prof’s past feedback. The final essay came back with solid structure, real analysis, proper citations, and writing that actually sounded like something I’d submit.

It passed Turnitin clean, the formatting was on point, and I didn’t have to fix a thing. Actual bliss.

They’re not the cheapest option, but the quality is consistent and I don’t get anxiety opening the file anymore.

**Final Thoughts**

If you’re asking, “**Is PapersRoo legit**?” yeah, they’re legit in the sense that they deliver something. But if you’re hoping for polished, college-level writing that won’t embarrass you, they’re not it.

For simple assignments or low-stakes homework, maybe. But anything important? I wouldn’t trust them based on my experience.

I’ve been sticking with Killer Papers ever since, and everything has been smooth, reliable, and genuinely high quality.

**TL;DR**:

My **PapersRoo review**: the paper was mid-generic writing, weak analysis, awkward formatting. Even after revisions, it still wasn’t something I felt comfortable turning in. Switched to Killer Papers afterward, and the quality jump was huge. They’re way more reliable and the writing actually feels like it was done by a real, competent human.",1,1763495865.0,studytips,1,1.0,False

I studied hard in school, graduated with my nursing degree and have been working half a decade in the field. 

Nursing has completely given me a new outlook on life. I feel I have financial stability for the first time ever. I enrolled in some financial literacy classes to break the cycle, and started saving and investing most of my paychecks since living frugally is all I’ve ever known. This past year, I bought a car. My own car. I have an IRA now AND have a retirement account that my employer is paying into. I live in a safe area of the city. I can afford to buy food—healthy food, to put on my table. I can even indulge in the little joys like a latte at my favorite coffee shop downtown before a shift. I have more hobbies than I have time for. Truly, all of this is because of nursing.

I see a lot of depressing posts about nursing, and don’t get me wrong, I work in an urban ER and see firsthand the brokenness of the system in which we work for. I know my experience is not the equivalent of other’s and I am definitely very privileged. More than anything, though, I’m overwhelmed with gratitude for this stable profession. Stable income. Good coworkers. Knowledge on how to help my patients. The feeling of being kinda a badass when a really bad trauma comes in and I know what I’m doing.

1p0m2xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/estateplanningbayarea/comments/1p0m2xq/sublease_or_assign_the_critical_difference_for/,Sublease or Assign: The Critical Difference for Getting Out of a California Lease,"[Life moves fast](https://baylegal.com/real-estate-housing-and-property-law/real-estate-law-faq/). Sometimes, it moves faster than your 12-month lease. A dream job offer in another state, a sudden family need, or a simple change of heart can leave you in a tough spot. You feel trapped, staring at a legally binding contract that ties you to a place you need to leave. Many people in California think they only have two choices: break the lease and face massive penalties, or stay and be miserable.

But there might be a third path.

You may have heard of “getting someone to take over your lease.” This sounds simple, but in the eyes of California rental law, this one idea splits into two very different legal concepts: subleasing and assigning. People use these terms interchangeably, but that is a costly mistake. Knowing the difference between sublease and assignment is not just legal trivia. It is the key to protecting your finances, your credit score, and your peace of mind.

Before you even whisper your plans to your roommate, you must understand what you are getting into. This is not a simple “lease takeover.” This is a complex legal process that, if done wrong, could leave you paying rent for an apartment you do not even live in anymore.

# The Sublease Trap: Why You’re Still on the Hook

Let’s talk about the most common option people consider: the sublease. A [sublease in California](https://baylegal.com/estate-plan-in-california-why-a-will-is-not-enough/) seems straightforward. You find someone new to move in, they pay you, and you pay the landlord. You are essentially playing landlord yourself, just for your old unit. This is where the trouble begins.

When you sublease, you become a “master tenant.” This sounds important, but it mostly just means you have all the master tenant responsibilities without any of the power. Your original lease with the landlord remains 100% active. You are still the only person your landlord cares about.

# What Does “Master Tenant” Really Mean?

This means if your new subtenant (the person you found) decides to stop paying rent, *you* have to pay it. If they throw a wild party and damage the walls, *you* are responsible for the repairs. If they refuse to leave at the end of the lease, *you* are the one the landlord will take to court. You are legally and financially tethered to that apartment, even from thousands of miles away.

This is why a simple handshake or a generic sublet agreement from the internet is so dangerous. A [proper sublet agreement](https://baylegal.com/choosing-an-executor-in-california-a-practical-guide-to-your-most-important-decision/) is a detailed legal contract between you and your subtenant. It should mirror the terms of your own lease. But even with a great agreement, you are still relying on a relative stranger to be responsible.

*Navigating the difference between sublease and assignment can be confusing. Bay Legal PC advises on California rental law to help you understand your options and avoid costly pitfalls. We will review your lease and discuss your master tenant responsibilities so you can make an informed decision. This is for informational purposes and not legal advice.

# The All-Important Landlord Approval

Of course, none of this can even happen without landlord approval for a sublease. Many California leases flat-out forbid subletting. If your lease does allow it, it almost always requires the landlord’s written consent. Trying to sneak someone in without approval is a direct violation of your lease and can get you *and* your subtenant evicted. Navigating a sublet agreement is a minefield.

# The “Clean Break” Fantasy: Assigning a Lease

If subleasing sounds like a nightmare, you might be thinking, “I’ll just assign the lease!” An assignment is, on paper, a much cleaner option. Assigning a lease is not about getting a temporary roommate. It is about finding a complete replacement.

With a [lease assignment contract](https://baylegal.com/estate-planning-for-blended-families-in-california-how-to-protect-your-spouse-and-your-kids/), you transfer your *entire* lease, your “privity of estate,” to a new person. This new tenant steps directly into your shoes. They pay the landlord directly. They are directly responsible to the landlord for the remainder of the lease term. You, theoretically, get to walk away.

This sounds like the perfect way to get out of a lease. But it is not that simple.

# The Approval Gauntlet: A Tougher Test

First, just like with a sublease, you need landlord approval. Assigning a lease is a much bigger deal for a landlord than a sublease. They are not just agreeing to a new occupant; they are agreeing to an entirely new tenant. They will run a full credit check, background check, and income verification. If your replacement is not as qualified as you, the landlord can, and likely will, say no.

This is attorney advertising; contacting us does not create an attorney-client relationship.*

# The Liability Loophole That Can Cost You Everything

Second, the difference between sublease and assignment is clearest in one area: liability. In a sublease, you are clearly still liable. In an assignment, your liability becomes… complicated. Even after you assign the lease, some California courts have held that the original tenant (you) may *still* be on the hook if the new tenant defaults. This is called “[privity of contract](https://baylegal.com/benefits-of-a-living-trust-a-guide-to-protecting-your-assets/).”

You gave your replacement the *responsibility* to pay (privity of estate), but you never broke your original *promise* to pay (privity of contract). The only way to get a true clean break is to get a “novation.” This is a new agreement, signed by you, the new tenant, and the landlord, that explicitly releases you from all future liability. As you can imagine, landlords have very little incentive to sign one.

This is the crucial difference between sublease and assignment that most renters miss. An assignment is not a magic wand. It is a complex lease takeover that requires careful negotiation. Without a formal release, you could find yourself in court years after you thought you were free.

# Reading the Fine Print: Your Lease Is the Law

The truth is, California rental law gives significant power to the landlord in these situations. Unless your lease *specifically* says the landlord cannot “unreasonably withhold consent” to a sublease or assignment, they can often deny your request for almost any reason, or no reason at all. Most standard leases are written to favor the landlord, giving them “sole discretion.”

This is why the very first step in getting out of a lease is not posting an ad online. It is sitting down with your lease, a highlighter, and maybe a strong cup of coffee. Look for any clauses that mention “sublease,” “assignment,” “transfer,” or “right to sublet.” These sections are your rulebook.

Ultimately, [California’s sublease law](https://baylegal.com/what-happens-without-an-estate-plan-in-california/) is complex. A sublease keeps you on the hook, making you a middle manager for your own apartment, with all the master tenant responsibilities and risk. Assigning a lease offers a cleaner break, but it is harder to get approved and may not fully release you from liability without a specific “novation” agreement.

Both options are a gamble. Both require landlord approval for sublease or assignment. And both are loaded with potential legal and financial traps. You have weighed the options, but getting your landlord’s approval is an entirely different battle. Are you prepared for what they might demand in return… or what happens if they just say ‘no’?

# Frequently Asked Questions

# 1. What is the main difference between a sublease and an assignment?

With a sublease, you are still the tenant and responsible to the landlord. With an assignment, the new tenant replaces you, but you might still have secondary liability. This is the key difference between a sublease and an assignment.

# 2. Do I always need landlord approval for a sublease in California?

Yes. Virtually all leases require landlord approval for a sublease. Ignoring this is a breach of your lease. Sublease California law strongly supports following the lease terms, so check your contract first.

# 3. Am I still responsible if I am assigning a lease?

Potentially, yes. When assigning a lease, you give up the property but not necessarily your original promise to pay. You need a “novation” (a new contract) to be fully released from the lease assignment contract.

# 4. What are my master tenant responsibilities in a sublease?

As the master tenant, your master tenant responsibilities include paying rent to the landlord (even if your subtenant does not pay you), fixing damage caused by your subtenant, and ensuring they follow all lease rules.

# 5. Is a verbal sublet agreement binding in California?

A verbal sublet agreement for less than one year can be binding, but it is extremely risky. Always get a written agreement to protect yourself and outline all terms, which is crucial under California rental law.

# 6. Can a landlord unreasonably deny a sublease or assignment?

It depends on your lease. If the lease says the landlord has “sole discretion,” they can say no for almost any reason. If it says “reasonable consent,” they must have a valid business reason.

# 7. Is a lease takeover the same as an assignment?

Yes, a lease takeover is the common term for assigning a lease. It means a new tenant is fully taking over the rights and responsibilities of the original lease, not just temporarily occupying the space.

# 8. What is the best way of getting out of a lease early?

The “best” way depends on your lease and landlord. A sublease or assignment is one option. Other methods, like negotiating a buy-out with your landlord or using a break clause, might also be possible.

# 9. What should be in a lease assignment contract?

A lease assignment contract should identify all parties (landlord, original tenant, new tenant), state that the new tenant assumes all lease duties, and ideally, include a clause that releases you from all future liability.

# 10. Where can I find help with sublease California law?

Sublease California law is complex. You can find information from tenant rights organizations or by consulting a qualified attorney who can advise on your specific lease and situation under California rental law.

because today i have realized my life's purpose... not my goal, not my legacy....

>my purpose

as in i am already at that stage of enlightenment, and i may be a hairs breadth from all the rest... if i haven't already done so \[idk i haven't looked that deeply into this, i haven't had the time\]

these are all of my truths i am reporting to you from right here in the relative comfort of my futon bed at home.

# i know it is far more likely that i will simply take a nap and wake up once more to this hellscape we call reality.

this is why i do not wish to worry my loved ones.

i just need to vent this.

but, it's also very, very, very possible...

that if i go to sleep, i may never wake up...

>just like my mother

who i know for my fact was just as autistic as me all along... but since this was 30/40 years ago no one and i fucking mean no one had a clue, not even my dad who loved her with all his heart.

and i also know, for my fact, that my mother attained enlightenment...

# she came to me in a dream just a scant few days after she passed

it was always just a cherished dream of mine, a sort of memory. it was very beautiful. but, it was just a dream in my reality.

this year i began to consider it differently as things in my life were changing and i have found myself on this weird sort of path since.

\_\_\_\_

now if you add in some of my weird cptsd on top of all of this,

this is why i'm terrified

i will be ""like mother like daughter""  
in this way too, the next time i fall asleep...

>in my weird ways, these posts i have been sharing, while i do know what i'm doing, i also see the mental health cracks within them too.

all these pieces of me i have been sharing...

>and yes, my very fucking autistic is \[re\]claiming the puzzle piece thing for myself  
just a me thing, doesn't need to be a you thing  
artist imagery thing, yo.  
also consider it a form of forced perspective shift art

ya'll my ""internal death clock"" has been tick tick ticking away at increasing rates over this year.

today it feels different.

i know, and want you to also know, i could very much be wrong.

but, in my weird fuckin ways here, i have been ""living like i was dying"" since living in the turmoil that is my current reality this year.

and it seems like no one fucking gets it.

because, though this actually literally also kills me to admit it...

>piece by piece, as i have been working to empower myself,  
my will to live has been also dying  
and i have desperately been doing all i can to cling to it

perhaps a bit too much, it may seem.

so,

i'm going to end this post and go take a nap, because i am utterly and wholly exhausted at this point.

idk all of what else is out there folks, but if i have the chance, i think i'm just gonna peace out this time.

i wanna go see outer space anyway, or have i not mentioned that yet?

when/if i wake, i'll throw a quick one-liner post up to let ya'll know i'm at least awake here.

once again, just going to go lay down and have an innocent nap.

but, just in case...

i'm not gonna go out saying ""*i tried my best*""

i'm gonna go out with a bang and say ""**i did my best given my current means and capabilities to assist myself as i truly need**""

\#fuckpoverty

i'm going to go to sleep in peace, dream of my happily ever after, and should i wake, i hope i will wake to a better time...",1,1763495704.0,thescottishimposition,0,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking advice for the parmalee concert at riverfront park this friday. it can get pretty crazy down there for big events, so hopefully this helps you out.  
  
honestly, the best move is to use an app like prked. you can rent someone's driveway or garage right next to riverfront park. it's usually way cheaper than lot parking and you can book a spot in advance. this way you totally skip the traffic chaos trying to find a spot and it's just a short walk to the venue.  
  
if you don't go that route, you have a few other options. there is some free parking right near the park, but it fills up super fast. a lot of people park at lee wenner park and walk over, but definitely have a backup plan in case it's full or closed for some reason. for bigger shows, i usually park in the grassy lots a bit down the road from river road coffee. it's an easy walk of a few blocks and getting out after the show is much quicker. you can also try to find street parking if you get there really early, or even use the bank parking lots in the area since it's after business hours.  
  
whatever you do, give yourself plenty of time. traffic can get backed up getting into cocoa village. wear comfy shoes because you'll probably have to walk a bit. also, remember they have some strict rules at the park - no chairs, umbrellas, coolers, or backpacks are allowed in.  
  
hope this helps and have an awesome time at the show",1,1763495493.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

  The car rides very smooth and has the ability to get the groceries faster than any ICE in its price range by FAR.  I have an expedition that absolutely guzzles gas and feels like a school bus (we have a few kids) I will have a hard time if the beautiful W wants me to get another. Not needing to fill up on gas covers my payments about 70-80% maybe more if you included oil changes driving 2500 miles a month. 
  I drive 4 kids to afterschool and weekend stuff often and they trash it. Even the white seats clean up over than I thought! I have the 150 dollar floor protectors off amazon and they have been a solid investment. 
 Sure FSD likes to left-lane-lollygag and NOT stick to its set 85 in hurry. Litterally that is my only qualm and is seriously overshadowed by everything else spectacularly.

We're both very interested in the Netherlands and we've allotted six-ish days for that part of the trip, but we're unsure about the other half.

Some options:

* London (3 days) > Netherlands (6 days) > Bruges/Ghent (3 days)
* Berlin (3 days) > Netherlands (6 days) > Bruges/Ghent (3 days)
* Split the trip between six days in the Netherlands and six days in another country

Our interests: wandering around neighborhoods, food, cocktails, beer, coffee, bookstores, theatre, architecture, parks, anything unique to the area

If it were entirely up to me (alas), I would spend the first week in England, but we're planning a UK-specific trip in 2027; that said, it could be fun to explore a particular area or two of London on this trip and then focus elsewhere in 2027.

But I wondered if we could use the second half of our trip to visit 2-3 spots in another country. I like the idea of visiting somewhere very different from the Netherlands if we took this route.

We're inclined to travel by train but would be open to flying somewhere if the train would take more than 4ish hours.

Someone mentioned here that wishlists tend to get more support than GoFundMe, so I went ahead and made one with just the basics I need while I’m rebuilding things like underwear, frying pan, and a cheap coffee maker. Things that would take some pressure off my food costs.

I’m still new to how wishlists work, so I’m not sure if I set it up right.  
If anyone has advice about how to make it visible or properly connected to my delivery address, I’d appreciate that too. I'm pretty sure I set it up right but someone told me it wasn't working and it was trying to send the items to them instead of me.

Here’s the list if anyone wants to take a look or offer advice/guidance:

I'm not sure if these are typical things, it's things I dont have anymore but definitely need. On top of that I've gotta save up for a winter jacket, boots, other winter attire. It's getting really cold in my city and we have long winters. I cant afford to insure my car yet so I'm going to be walking a lot for awhile.

I dont have any kind of support system and I've never really asked for help before, especially from people who dont even know me, so I appreciate anyone willing to help in any way.",1,1763495226.0,Assistance,2,1.0,False

1p0lsu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1p0lsu2/am_i_being_shorted_on_my_paycheck/,Am I being shorted on my paycheck?,"Hi all, I was recently looking at my paystubs and something isn’t adding up to me. Now, granted, I’m terrible at math but I should be able to handle simple multiplication and reading a paystub so I’m either making a mistake in my math or I don’t understand how things are depicted on paystubs. So I’m hoping y’all will be able to help me out. I live in Dallas, Texas in the US in case the location makes a difference. I also get paid bi-weekly, again, in case that makes any difference. If you need any other details, please let me know. I’ve also got a picture of the breakdown of my paystub if that’s needed.

So my company has a base pay of $16.75 at 49 hours a week. Because I work on second shift, I get a differential of fifty cents. This brings my pay up to $17.25. I occasionally work overtime. My understanding of overtime is that it’s half of my pay plus my pay. So $17.25/2 then +$17.25 for a total of $$25.86 an hour per hour of overtime. If my understanding of this is wrong, then please let me know as it likely solves everything. 

So on one line, they’ve got 10/19-10/25 for 40 hours at $16.75. On another line, they have the same dates but for 44.07 hours paid at .50¢. For that specific week, I’m credited with 10.20 hours of overtime paid at $16.75 on one line item, and then a “OTPay FLSA Prem” with 10.20 hours at a rate of $8.595. This results in a total of overtime pay of $258.52 for that week. Regular pay for that week is $692.04. 

Shouldn’t the overtime be $263.86?

Granted, it’s not a lot of money. It’s five bucks. Barely enough for a cup of coffee at Starbucks. But you wouldn’t believe the amount of issues we’ve all had with this company paying us properly. It took over a month for them to start giving us our differential and I still haven’t seen my backpay for the prior three pay periods that they shorted me that money on. So I don’t trust them to pay me correctly on the backpay or on my regular checks, and I really want to make sure that I’ve got everything that I’m entitled to receive. 

If I need to provide more information, please let me know.

This is a temporary contract position where I, and everyone else on the project, were told multiple times we would be paid $17.25 although the official pay work only lists the base pay of $16.75 and it’s been confirmed to me by my manager multiple times that were supposed to be getting $17.25 so she’s aware of the issue.

I tried a ton of stuff, bought way too much, and had some really great conversations with founders.

*Here's the complete breakdown of what stood out:*

**SUPPLEMENTS & NUTRITION**

[**London Nootropics**](https://londonnootropics.com/) \- I'm just a sucker for a good mushroom coffee and the flavor of these were great. They blend functional mushrooms like Lion's Mane and Cordyceps with instant coffee. If you've been let down by the usual earthy/bitter taste of mushroom coffees, give these a shot. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**V14**](https://v14.com/) \- I liked the flavor and ingredients on this product a lot. It's a longevity-focused supplement blend. Reminds me of Novos Labs Core a bit in how they approach formulation. I liked the flavor but my friend didn't so depends on your taste. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

[**Kosterina**](https://www.kosterina.com/) \- I did a shot of this high polyphenol olive oil every day. Great tasting and love the shot form factor - makes it easy to be consistent with getting quality polyphenols in. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

[**Tonum**](https://tonum.com/) \- Learned about this product from Sean Wells who is doing lots of interesting things within the di-peptide space (GLP-1 alts etc). I think the formulations are pretty interesting and I like that they do research as well, not just slapping together trendy ingredients. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**Timeline**](https://www.timelinenutrition.com/) \- I really like how Urolithin A makes me feel. Really helps my energy levels. This is one of the few longevity supplements where I actually notice consistent effects. Already a long time user. (✅ *Purchased*)

[**TMW Longevity**](https://tmwlongevity.com/) \- Smaller brand with a liposomal supplement heavy on functional mushrooms. I thought the formulation was kind of cool. Founder was very nice and worth trying out. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**Pendulum**](https://pendulumlife.com/) \- I've used them before, didn't feel a huge difference but I think the science is sound and I like their founder a lot, Colleen. They're doing interesting work with specific bacterial strains that aren't in most probiotics like Akermansia. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**EnergyBites**](https://energybites.com/) \- Had samples of their spirulina and chlorella. It's hard to find well sourced and tested algae so liked that they did lots of testing for contaminants. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**Jumpsport Liquid Hydrogen**](https://www.jumpsport.com/products/liquid-hydrogen-h2-electrolyte-zero-sugar-drink-mix) \- I tried their Molecular Hydrogen Electrolytes. Couldn't really tell the benefits but an interesting new product vertical. Hydrogen water is having a moment. (✖️ *Won't Purchase*)

[**Echo Water**](https://echowater.com/) \- Tried their hydrogen water system. Couldn't really tell the benefits but an interesting new device vertical worth watching. (✖️ *Won't Purchase*)

**PEPTIDES**

[**Protocole**](https://theprotocole.com/) \- I really like this founder and think they are the best option on the market for legally sourcing tested peptides (if you don't want to risk self sourcing from China). Quality testing and transparency on sourcing is huge in this space, but you pay for what you get. (⭐ *Highly Recommend*)

**FOOD & BEVERAGE**

[**Prima**](https://eatprima.com/) \- Love these protein bars. Great between sessions. Clean ingredients and macros, actually tastes good. Interestingly David was also there, but wasn't a fan of their bar at all. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

[**Seatopia**](https://www.seatopia.com/) \- This is the only fish I'll ever buy again. Raised in open ocean pens with zero microplastics or heavy metals detected in their testing. If you care about seafood quality, this is the new standard. (⭐ *Highly Recommend*)

[**Wild Orchard Tea**](https://www.wildorchard.com/) \- Regenerative agriculture tea from the volcanic soil of Jeju Island in Korea. Was great. Love the sourcing story and the quality shows. Didn't get to try their Black Matcha, but very intrigued. (✅ *Purchased*)

[**Lineage Provisions**](https://lineageprovisions.com/) \- They had their beef jerky (air dried steak) samples at the convention and wow it was honestly so fucking good. If you're a meat eater definitely recommend this product. I went through like three bags. (✅ *Purchased*)

[**Big Bold Health**](https://bigboldhealth.com/) \- Bought some of the buckwheat. I actually got to sit in with a session with Dr. Jeffrey Bland, their founder, who was the sweetest. Very smart and a huge pioneer in functional medicine. (✅ *Purchased*)

**TESTING & DIAGNOSTICS**

[**MoldCo**](https://moldco.com/) \- I know the founder well and am a patient. Great for mold testing and recovery. If you're dealing with mold exposure or suspect it, this is the best resource I've found for comprehensive testing and actual recovery protocols. (⭐ *Highly Recommend*)

[**Lutanen Health**](https://lutanen.com/) \- This founder is one of my favorite people I met at the summit. Dr. Luthar is an incredibly knowledgable longevity focused doctor in Boston. Lutanen is a concierge clinic and basically exactly what I personally was looking for. More affordable than a lot of the other clinics and run by a doctor who is at the cutting edge of medicine. (⭐ *Highly Recommend*)

[**Generation Labs**](https://generationlab.com/) \- Doing great work in the biological age testing space. Definitely worth checking out if you're serious about tracking longevity metrics beyond just feeling good. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

[**OneSkin**](https://www.oneskin.co/) \- I did skin testing with OneSkin and got their serum to test. I like them a lot and the science is good - they're working with proprietary peptides. I don't always love their product textures though. (✅ *Purchased*)

[**Eli Health**](https://eli.health/) \- I got a sample pack to test my cortisol which I did today. Pretty cool product for at-home hormone testing but wish there were more insights out of the box beyond just giving you the numbers. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

[**Tiny Health**](https://www.tinyhealth.com/) \- Got a sample test to try out. Will report back. I'm a Jona user for microbiome testing, so curious how it's different. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

**DEVICES & TECHNOLOGY**

[**Nuropod**](https://nuropod.com/) \- Wow I tried a lot of cool devices and I had heard about this one back in the day from Bryan Johnson. He actually still uses this and I can tell why. I felt a huge effect in one session even. Almost valium level calm. It's a sensory deprivation float pod - if you're serious about stress management this is worth the investment. (⭐ *Highly Recommend*)

[**Absolute Rest**](https://www.absoluterest.com/) \- Very cool startup helping insomnia sufferers. Really loved their founder who I met briefly. Great team and mission. If you're dealing with sleep issues beyond basic sleep hygiene, check out what they're building. (⭐ *Highly Recommend*)

[**SaunaSpace**](https://saunaspace.com/) \- I briefly met the founder who was lovely and the products felt great when I quickly tried them out. They make near-infrared saunas. Would love to spend more time with them though - didn't get a full session. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**Molekule**](https://molekule.com/) \- I got to chat with some of the execs and they have some cool new products on the horizon. This was the first air purifier I bought and my parents still use theirs. Still holds up. (✅ *Purchased*)

[**OxyHealth**](https://oxyhealth.com/) \- I tried their HBOT chamber which was my first HBOT experience which is crazy considering how long I've been biohacking. Worked well and no issues with claustrophobia, my ears just hurt a bit after. Felt a bit blissed out the rest of the day which was nice. Definitely want to explore regular HBOT now. (✖️ *Won't Purchase*)

[**Shiftwave**](https://shiftwave.co/) \- I was very sad I didn't get to try Shiftwave which seemed awesome and I heard great things from the people that did try it. It's a PEMF device. (⚠️ *Missed*)

[**Ammortal Chamber**](https://ammortal.com/) \- I was 3 minutes late to my appointment and they canceled my appointment which was frustrating but my friend might be buying one for his clinic so will report back. It's a red light therapy + vibration + molecular hydrogen bed. The design looks super cool. (⚠️ *Missed*)

[**NanoVi**](https://eng3corp.com/) \- Tried the NanoVi and didn't really feel much. I also don't know if there is much research behind ""structured water"" so not really sure about this one. (✖️ *Won't Purchase*)

[**Aescape**](https://aescape.com/) \- Was overbooked so I couldn't get my robot massage. Bummed because this looked really interesting, but probably not a replacement for human massages anyway. (⚠️ *Missed*)

**SKINCARE & FRAGRANCE**

[**Auro Wellness**](https://aurowellness.com/) \- Made a topical Glutathione that really brightened my skin in a crazy way. I'm still trying to figure out why - the transdermal delivery of glutathione is interesting. Results were noticeable. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**Young Goose**](https://younggoose.com/) \- I tried a face mist from Young Goose. Their formulations are pretty cool with some interesting peptide blends + senolytics, but also very expensive. Premium skincare for sure. (✖️ *Won't Purchase*)

[**Realm**](https://www.breatherealm.co/) \- Great healthy swap for fragrance sprays. Clean ingredients, no questionable chemicals. Simple but needed. I really liked their approach. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

**THERAPEUTICS**

[**Beond Ibogaine**](https://beondibogaine.com/) \- *Planning to Try* Beond Ibogaine was very present throughout the summit. Seems like a great team and a powerful therapeutic for addiction and mental health. It's still expensive for many people at $12k+ but I'm going to save up and try it out. If anyone has experience with their program, let me know. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

**PRODUCTS TO WATCH**

[**Myoform**](https://www.myoform.io/) \- Talked to this founder and very excited for this product to launch. Personalized supplements have always been promising but never done right IMO. These guys are approaching the problem in an interesting way and have their own factory to make the supplements, which gives them way more control over quality than white label operations. (✅ *Joined Waitlist*)

**Overall:**

Really enjoyed Eudemonia. The quality of founders and products was high, and the conversations were worth the trip alone. I'll share some of my favorite sessions/topics in another post.

**What I'm prioritizing from this:**

1. Nuropod for regular vagal nerve stimulation sessions
2. Protocole for clean peptides
3. Seatopia for all my fish
4. Getting more HBOT sessions in
5. Saving up for Beond Ibogaine

We're both very interested in the Netherlands and we've allotted six-ish days for that part of the trip, but we're unsure about the other half.

  
Some options:

* London (3 days) > Netherlands (6 days) > Bruges/Ghent (3 days)
* Berlin (3 days) > Netherlands (6 days) > Bruges/Ghent (3 days) 
* Split the trip between six days in the Netherlands and six days in another country

  
Our interests: wandering around neighborhoods, food, cocktails, beer, coffee, bookstores, theatre, architecture, parks, anything unique to the area

If it were entirely up to me (alas), I would spend the first week in England, but we're planning a UK-specific trip in 2027; that said, it could be fun to explore a particular area or two of London on this trip and then focus elsewhere in 2027.

But I wondered if we could use the second half of our trip to visit 2-3 spots in another country. I like the idea of visiting somewhere very different from the Netherlands if we took this route.

We're inclined to travel by train but would be open to flying somewhere if the train would take more than 4ish hours. We both studied abroad in college (me in Vienna, him in England) and I've visited many of the biggest cities/capitals (Budapest, Paris, Warsaw, Venice/Rome/Florence, Madrid, Bucharest), although I was a 19yo idiot so they're all worth another visit.

If anyone has experience with their program, let me know. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

**PRODUCTS TO WATCH**

[**Myoform**](https://www.myoform.io/) \- Talked to this founder and very excited for this product to launch. Personalized supplements have always been promising but never done right IMO. These guys are approaching the problem in an interesting way and have their own factory to make the supplements, which gives them way more control over quality than white label operations. (✅ *Joined Waitlist*)

**Overall:**

Really enjoyed Eudemonia. The quality of founders and products was high, and the conversations were worth the trip alone. I'll share some of my favorite sessions/topics in another post.

**What I'm prioritizing from this:**

1. Nuropod for regular vagal nerve stimulation sessions
2. Protocole for clean peptides
3. Seatopia for all my fish
4. Getting more HBOT sessions in
5. Saving up for Beond Ibogaine

# The Sniper NTP integrates a multi-datalink, multi-processor Hybrid Base Station (HBS) with the existing Sniper ATP, turning it into an airborne communications and edge-computing node.

Lockheed Martin has unveiled the latest evolution of its proven Sniper targeting pod, called the [Sniper Networked Targeting Pod](https://theaviationist.com/2024/07/25/sniper-targeting-pod-will-become-advanced-communications-and-computing-node/) (NTP), whose development was announced last year. By integrating a multi-datalink, multi-processor Hybrid Base Station (HBS) with the existing Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (ATP), the new system becomes an airborne communications and edge-computing node.

# Sniper NTP

The image accompanying the [press release](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/features/2025/sniper-evolved-targeting-pod-adds-critical-network-node.html) shows the outer shape of the Sniper pod almost untouched, with the difference being a conformal section attached below the middle section of the pod. It is likely that this section hosts the arrays used by the datalink to share the data with other assets.

Notably, the Sniper NTP allows the carrier aircraft to easily communicate with the [F-35 Lightning II](https://theaviationist.com/2025/11/13/b61-12-stockpile-flight-tests/). In fact, the company says “the Hybrid Base Station (HBS) utilizes a flexible architecture to support various datalinks and processors, including the Multifunction Advanced Datalink (MADL) for F-35 interoperability and Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) radios for resilient mesh networking.”

The pod is described as a cost-effective, flexible “plug-and-play design” that will let users add secure high-speed communications and processing to their aircraft. This way, fourth-generation aircraft can receive and act on sensor data from fifth-generation aircraft, as well as other networked sources.

[The infographic showing a concept of operation of the new Sniper Networked Targeting Pod. \(Image credit: Lockheed Martin\)](https://preview.redd.it/h2oron6s822g1.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=506a3d3e277678774f167b1cd633d0936f5f1215)

“Without compromising stealth, an F-35 can identify targets and pass precise coordinates through Sniper NTP to an F-16 which can then engage the target using long range weapons,” says Lockheed Martin. “This secure data sharing at 5G+ speeds is a critical node to connect fighters, ground stations, uncrewed aircraft, Navy vessels and satellites.”

The company further said that “future demonstrations will showcase multi-aircraft coordination, secure video share and dynamic targeting handoffs.” As a concept of operation, an infographic shows an F-35 sharing a threat’s location trough [MADL](https://theaviationist.com/2025/04/14/f-35-executes-first-live-classified-lightning-ii-data-share-outside-the-u-s/) with two Sniper NTP-equipped F-16s, which then use MANET to further relay the information to a command center for an engagement with HIMARS.

“\[Sniper NTP\] provides a cost-effective, flexible upgrade path that extends mission relevance without aircraft modification — a capability many allied air forces have asked for as they look to keep long-serving fourth-generation aircraft ready and capable in an increasingly mixed-fleet and digital environment,” says Lockheed Martin. The [F-16 Block 70/72](https://theaviationist.com/2025/04/01/taiwans-first-newly-built-f-16-block-70/) would be a likely candidate to be equipped with the Sniper NTP, as these newly built aircraft (and the upgraded F-16Vs) will be flying together with modern assets like the F-35 for the years to come.

# Sniper ATP

The AN/AAQ-33 [Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/mfc/pc/sniper-pod/mfc-sniper-atp-pc-01.pdf) (ATP) is one of the most widely fielded EO/IR targeting systems, with more than 1,650 pods delivered and more than five million operational hours logged in U.S. and allied air forces. The system provides long-range target detection, precision identification and laser designation for a broad range of strike and ISR missions.

  
The pod combines a high-definition mid-wave infrared sensor with a stabilized TV camera and a dual-mode laser designator/illuminator. This sensor suite allows aircrews to acquire, track and identify targets at significant stand-off ranges, while generating weapon-quality coordinates to support GPS-guided and laser-guided munitions.

Lockheed Martin highlights that the pod’s advanced image-processing and automated tracking algorithms significantly reduce pilot workload, enabling stable tracking of moving targets even during high-speed maneuvers. In addition to its strike role, the Sniper ATP has become a valuable [non-traditional ISR asset](https://theaviationist.com/2025/08/28/evolution-b-1/) during its many combat deployments.

The pod can also record and downlink full-motion video with metadata to ground controllers or other aircraft, supporting real-time coordination in dynamic environments. This way, the Sniper ATP can also provide overhead surveillance for ground units, adding another layer of security.

As we previously reported here at *The Aviationist*, the pod’s high-resolution IR imagery has proven useful even in air-to-air contexts, being adopted to aid in the identification of tracks of interest by Quick Reaction Alert aircraft. A notable case was Taiwanese F-16Vs using their Sniper pods to [capture detailed IR footage](https://theaviationist.com/2024/10/15/taiwans-f-16s-sniper-pod-j-15/) of PLA Navy J-15 fighters during a close encounter.

[IBC Awarded Another Tooling Contract by Lockheed | Foundry Management & Technology](https://www.foundrymag.com/materials/article/21928610/ibc-awarded-another-tooling-contract-by-lockheed)

[2015- 2025\~ A lot might have changed in 10 years?....](https://preview.redd.it/foyl6lkl922g1.png?width=350&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7570428ab9a81bc105232df537f816e7ca4787d)

Lockheed Martin’s Sniper ATP is a “targeting pod” that provides air-to-ground and air-to-air targeting capability for fixed-wing aircraft.

Investment caster IBC Engineered Materials has a new Lockheed Martin contract to design, manufacture, and implement hard tooling for the final qualification of Beralcast^(®) castings as **a beryllium-aluminum alternative** for precision targeting components for the Sniper ATP. IBC, an operating division of IBC Advanced Alloys Corp., already supplies beryllium-aluminum castings to Lockheed for the electro-optical targeting system (EOTS) of the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter jet.

The value and other terms of the contract were not announced.

The Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod is a long-range, target detection/identification and continuous surveillance system for fixed-wing aircraft, for all missions, including close air-support of ground forces. It provides pilots with high-resolution images for precision targeting and non-traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions.

IBC noted that Beralcast alloys can be cast into high-performance, complex parts that require lightweight and high-stiffness qualities, and can substitute for aluminum, magnesium, titanium, metal matrix composites, as well as pure beryllium or powder-met beryllium-aluminum. The principal Beralcast alloys are more than three times stiffer than aluminum, 22% lighter, and can be precision-cast for simple and complex three-dimensional stability.

**Chris Huskamp**, president of Wilmington, MA-based IBC Engineered Materials, said, ""Sniper ATP is an interoperable system across multiple aircraft platforms and sets the benchmark for next-generation electro-optical targeting systems. Our family of castable beryllium**-aluminum alloys**, or Beralcast^(®), is ideal for applications such as Sniper ATP where weight, modulus and temperature stability (CTE) are critical performance factors.""

CENTENNIAL, Colo. (October 23, 2025) – NioCorp Developments Ltd. (“**NioCorp**” or the “**Company**”) (**NASDAQ:NB**), a leading U.S. critical minerals developer, has entered into an agreement with Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) to support the development of a scandium-based defense technology with its Skunk Works^(®) advanced development programs division.  The program is being funded by the U.S. Department of War (“**DoW**”).

The program is designed to produce prototype components of aluminum-scandium alloy that will expand the capabilities of modern fighter aircraft.  No additional details on the development program were released.

“We are pleased to collaborate with NioCorp on this important initiative that will connect domestic critical materials mining through the value-chain to advanced materials to provide advanced capabilities for the warfighter,” said OJ Sanchez, vice president and general manager, Lockheed Martin Skunk Works^(®).

“NioCorp is pleased to be working with Skunk Works in an effort to harness the groundbreaking power of scandium in a new defense technology for the Pentagon,” said Mark A. Smith, NioCorp CEO and Chairman.  “When NioCorp comes online to produce approximately 100 tonnes per year of scandium oxide – after being 100% dependent upon foreign producers for so many years for our scandium – that will be a game changer for both U.S. defense and commercial applications.  I look forward to seeing the results of this prototype component manufacturing initiative come to fruition.”

Funding for the effort is being provided by the Pentagon as part of a $10 million agreement via Title III of the Defense Production Act to support the establishment of a domestic scandium mine-to-master-alloy supply chain via the Company’s [**Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project**](https://www.niocorp.com/wp-content/uploads/NioCorp_Presentation.pdf) in southeast Nebraska.

[**The award**](https://www.niocorp.com/u-s-department-of-defense-awards-up-to-10-million-to-niocorps-subsidiary-elk-creek-resources-corp/) to NioCorp’s operating subsidiary, Elk Creek Resources Corp., (“**ECRC**”) follows a federal appropriations plus-up in the Fiscal Year 2024 DoW appropriations bill that was championed by U.S. Senator Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), other Members of the Nebraska Congressional delegation, and both Democrats and Republicans across the Congress.  The investment by DoW supports President Trump’s March 20, 2025, Executive Order 14241 on *Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production’s* goal to facilitate domestic mineral production.

Located near Elk Creek, Nebraska, ECRC is developing the United States’ first polymetallic deposit targeting near-term production of scandium, niobium, titanium, and light and heavy magnetic rare earth oxides (NdPr, Dy & Tb), all of which are critical minerals upon which the U.S. is completely or largely reliant on foreign producers.

[\#NIOCORP\~NioCorp Developments Ltd. (NB) Presents at Morgan Stanley Virtual National Security & Critical Materials Symposium Transcript & a bit more with coffee.. : r/NIOCORP\_MINE](https://www.reddit.com/r/NIOCORP_MINE/comments/1oxqrol/niocorpniocorp_developments_ltd_nb_presents_at/)

***Across the transcript, several major new or more explicit elements showed up:***

# Here is some SPECULATION ON WHAT MARK SMITH JUST MIGHT HAVE REVEALED (Nov 14, 2025 Morgan Stanley Event)

# A. NioCorp says it is working on onshoring the entire scandium supply chain.

Direct quotes:

* “We don't produce any scandium metal… We don’t produce any scandium aluminum alloy… NioCorp is **working on all of those supply chain issues**.”
* “We hope to have **announcements** in the near future about efforts to make sure the scandium supply chain is **fully onshore**.” ***\~This is the first time he has stated this publicly with this degree of clarity!\*\*\*\*\*\*\****

# B. He explicitly ties scandium alloy demand to Lockheed Martin and defense applications.

* Lockheed has a **“new technology”** for fighter jets that **requires Scandium**.
* NioCorp is supporting this R&D pathway.
* He links scandium directly to **U.S. pilot safety, lethality, and performance upgrades**.

**This is strategically significant.**

# C. He hints at additional “midstream / downstream partnerships.”

He openly acknowledges NioCorp is exploring **JVs, acquisitions, or co-development** with midstream & downstream processors.

\*\*\*That’s an explicit admission of **vertical-integration moves**!

# D. He repeats the same “just a little more funding” line.

He says NioCorp needs:

* EXIM → $780M loan (expected FY26?)
* **\*\*\*Additional equity / flexible capital**
* A few “technical items” for EXIM (proven reserves, offtake, etc.)

This mirrors a **speculative** observation that Mark might be positioning for a final, smaller tranche of capital $$$ to complete full financing. (T.B.D.)

# E. He again repeats the mysterious number: a ~$$$$ unknown downstream facility???

He didn’t say the number in this transcript, but he referenced the **need for a U.S. scandium metal → scandium alloy manufacturing pathway.**  
\*\*\*And he has repeatedly mentioned requiring **a strategic facility** they want operational **control of?**

[Darn Interesting \\""DOTS!\\""... once again](https://reddit.com/link/1p0lpe6/video/88mc4qiqe22g1/player)

IMHO\~ Over the past decade, a quiet but traceable network has formed between NioCorp, IBC, Lockheed Martin, and various U.S. defense-related materials players. ***The original 2015 IBC–Lockheed–Huskamp linkage through Sniper pod tooling created early aerospace materials synergies.*** Fast forward to today, and the same constellation of companies and personnel has re-aligned just as the DoD and Lockheed have begun openly exploring scandium alloys for next-gen fighter, ISR, UAV, and hypersonic applications. ***What’s new is that NioCorp has now publicly stated it is working to onshore the entire scandium supply chain, from Sc metal to Sc-Al alloy — something the U.S. doesn’t have at any scale.***

**If you line up the timeline**, the pieces fit a plausible **but unconfirmed strategic push:** NioCorp provides the resource; Nanoscale and Creative Engineers demonstrate U.S. scandium metal production pathways (now ongoing); IBC (with Huskamp back on the board) potentially fills the alloy/component role; and Lockheed/DoD anchor the downstream demand through ongoing R&D collaborations. Mark Smith repeatedly mentioning a needed $$$ **“strategic facility”** aligns almost perfectly with the **potential** cost of building a domestic Sc → Sc-Al pilot-to-pre-production plant. **While nothing official links these events, the industrial logic is unusually tight — this is exactly how the DoD seeds and builds new defense materials supply chains. \~(Titanium in the 1950's)**

**""IF""** this **scenario** is accurate, the potential outcome is the emergence of the first fully domestic Sc-Al ecosystem in U.S. history: U.S. scandium oxide → U.S. scandium metal → U.S. Sc-Al alloy production → U.S. billet/casting/rolling → Lockheed and DoD component qualification. That would directly support modernization efforts like the new Sniper targeting pod upgrade (above), F-35 lightweighting opportunities, next-gen UAV structures, and classified 6th-gen airframe materials needs. **It would also give the U.S. independence from foreign scandium inputs for the first time ever — a major strategic objective.**

**\*\*\*Again, none of this is confirmed! All Speculation!\*\*\***

 But the re-aligned players, the timing of recent announcements, the DoD R&D grant, the reappearance of key personnel, and NioCorp’s sudden explicit talk about **“onshoring the full scandium supply chain”** all point toward a coordinated materials strategy taking shape behind the scenes. Whether it culminates in a DoD-/Lockheed-supported Sc-Al facility and full Elk Creek financing is still unknown **— but the pieces have never aligned this cleanly before.**

Deuteronomy 32:17

 

 

 

“Ready?” she’ll say, her eyes glinting in the light of Times Square’s flickering advertisements. It will be months since the first bombs fell, and still the clouds of ash and debris will fill the sky, blocking the faint light of the night already struggling to push through remnants of the city’s light pollution. The roads will be coated in fine grey powder, the ashes of Washington, D.C. still fluttering down from the sky.

“Yes. Not like there is much of a choice,” you’ll reply. You’ll scratch your head, frustrated that having to sleep in the street last night exposed you to some kind of mites.

She’ll lead you through the empty ash covered streets, the unnatural silence broken only by the groans and howls of inhuman beasts raging against their sicknesses. It will be uncomfortable with your sore legs, but you will push through the relative silence and follow her into a rotten husk of a coffee shop. You’ll be reminded of its name, an old memory of your younger years tugging hard against your heart. You’ll wonder what ever happened to your siblings. The girl will turn back to you, smiling widely as she mimics what she imagines what a barista would do. You’ll shake your head free of your previous thoughts and smile back at her.

“Not like that. Lemme show you how it’s done,” you’ll say. You’ll familiarize yourself with the counter and then walk her through the steps you used to take during your first job. She’ll laugh as you pretend to pour the fresh coffee into a cup, and she’ll laugh harder when you nearly vomit from the stench of rotting milk in the fridge. It will be a nice moment; one you will pray you keep in mind when things get worse. It almost always gets worse.

You’ll move on, back into the silent streets. You’ll have no real need to sneak or keep the silence yourself, but for some reason, it will feel disrespectful not to keep it. The girl will follow closely behind you, muttering something about missing the taste of her father’s coffee. “It was always gross to me, you know? Too bitter. I doubt he ever put a single drop of creamer in it. He’d say, ‘When you grow up, you’ll understand why Mom and I drink this stuff, kid.’ It’s a shame I’ll never get what he was trying to say,” she’ll muse.

You’ll promise her one day she’ll try it. “Maybe,” you’ll say, “one of the suburbs outside the city have a coffee shop that wasn’t raided just yet. I could make you a cup then.”

She’ll smile that big, crooked smile she always finds the strength to wear. “Thanks!”

It will take quite some time to travel to the mouth of the Lincoln Tunnel. Cars litter the roadways, blocking any acceptable vehicle route. The girl will find a pair of bicycles, both foldable. One will be far too small for either of you to ride, and its pink frame will fill you with a strange sense of dread. You’ll let the girl take the other, though the ache in your legs is becoming rather annoying. She’ll argue that you should take it and rest, but you’ll adamantly refuse until she peddles off down the road to scout ahead. You’ll watch as her short, chin length hair flaps behind her like a cape and smile.

“Over here!” she’ll call in a loud whisper. She’ll peddle back, panting excitedly and nearly hopping off of her new bike. “There’s a tent village here! Maybe they’ll trade with us! I could use a new pair of socks.”

You’ll look at the necklace around her neck. The small golden cross her fiancé once gifted her will twinkle in what little light the ash clouds let in. “Not with that,” you’ll say, almost disgustedly. You still cannot understand why she wears it, especially after all that has happened. You’ve often expressed your distaste with the jewelry, but she just as often complains of your marks. “Just stay quiet and hidden. Let me handle the trade.”

She’ll grumble, but she’ll crawl into the backseat of an abandoned Prius, taking the sidearm you hand her. “Just hurry back, yeah? I really don’t like being left alone,” she’ll say, a familiar hint of anxiety creeping into her voice. You’ll make promises, unsure whether you can keep them.

As you walk towards the tent, you’ll remember how you found her months ago. She was hog-tied and gagged in the trunk of an old, rusted out Toyota. A large bruise covered her eye, and  her eyeliner just black streaks on her cheeks. Her wrists were raw and bloody against the zip ties. You could hardly make out her features under the matting of her then shoulder length hair. Trafficking, you surmised from her story. You’ll sigh, suddenly regretting telling her to hide in the backseat.

“Oi! ‘oo’s ‘at walkin’ ‘ere?” a voice will call out. You’ll hear the clicking of safeties, a sound so familiar these days you won’t even react. You’ll count ten clicks, give or take a few. Your regret of leaving the girl behind will subside dramatically at their numbers.

“Just looking to trade, if you are willing,” you’ll say, hands raised slowly and slightly.

An older man will step out from behind a large orange tent, one capable of holding around four or five people. He’ll level a large revolver at you, but that won’t be his most striking feature. That will be saved for his attire, a perfectly clean three-piece suit with a bright orange tie. “Hands higher, shithead. No quick movements or your head goes back the way it came,” he’ll threaten. You won’t believe him, of course. His revolver, though menacing, won’t stop shaking in his visibly bandaged hands. But, for the girl’s sake, you’ll play along.

“I’m unarmed, if you’re worried about that,” you’ll say. “And alone. You can check me if you want. Like I said, I just want to trade.”

The first speaker will walk out from behind an overturned SUV. A slightly heavy-set woman, her shirt too tight but clear it had once fit her. A good sign, you’ll think. The group must be well stocked. “Trade, eh? ‘ere I’s thinkin’ you wanted tah yoink our shtuff all sneaky like,” she’ll chuckle. She’ll wave you in, her hands noticeably bandaged like the suit’s are. You’ll lower your hands and walk into the tent village cautiously.

A campfire will be burning in a small, almost pentagonal ring of stones at the center of the tent village. Dark smears cover the edges of the tents’ “doorways.” You’ll scoff under your breath. Just like the girl, these people seem to hold some foolish traditions or superstitions. To your surprise, you’ll hear the braying of goats. They’ll be standing in a makeshift pen, a disgusting smelling tin bucket hanging nearby. You’ll make the connection immediately. These people have been smearing goat droppings on their tents as some sort of deterrent, but you’ll still be at a loss for the origin of the goats. When you ask, the man in the suit will reply, “It was a miracle we found them. There was a farm show or something outside the city. Kevin, over there with the ridiculous cowboy hat, was the driver. His truck is right there, much use as it is now. The goats have helped keep us fed the past few months.”

You’ll sit on one of the five chairs surrounding the fire, and the heavy woman and the suit will sit opposite you. “So, yeh wanta trade? Whatcha got ‘n’ whatcha want?” the woman will ask as she stokes the flame. A few other villagers will roam around watching you. You’ll swear one of them licks their lips at your every movement. Another, you’ll feel, is far too comfortable aiming a rifle at you.

You’ll pull out a few blankets. They won’t be your best, as you’ve left those with the girl, but these are still a fine quality. You’ll smile to yourself, remembering how the girl and you went on a “shopping spree” in the Pottery Barn to get them. “I’ve also got this heavier coat here,” you’ll say, tugging at your sleeve. “It’s getting colder, and I’m not sure if these tents will block out the late fall chill. All I ask in return is a fair amount of food.”

“We can give you a week’s worth of canned goods. Should be enough to keep one person full until you find a better place to stay,” the suit will say. He’ll seem to be more confident, as if he’s back in the old world. You’ll wonder if he was a stockbroker once, but you know better than to ask about the old world. Ever since that missile crashed into the Jordan River like a falling star, the old world was just a memory.

“Make it two weeks’ worth and you have a deal,” you’ll counter. 

“One and a half,” the suit will reply.

“Deal,” you’ll say, shaking hands with the suit. You’ll watch as his face turns slightly disappointed. Perhaps he had desired a longer negotiation to relive his status in the old world, but you’ll have no desire to stick around. The quicker this conversation was over, the quicker you could return to the girl and move on.

You’ll follow them to Kevin’s truck. It sits slightly off kilter on the edge of the roadway beside the tent village. Kevin stands guard, his hat matched in size only by his double-barreled shotgun. A cigarette will be burning in his lips, and you won’t be able to help but feel he looks like a poor cartoon version of a cowboy designed by a child. He’ll open the truck bed where piles of canned goods sit stacked, protected from the elements by an off-color bed cap. Judging by the layers of duct tape around its edges, you’ll find it safe to assume Kevin did not arrive with the bed cap.

The suit and the heavy-set woman will load up your backpack with cans. You’ll watch them work for a time before turning your gaze into the tunnel. You’ll hear a sudden, distant boom from within, not unlike thunder. Your hosts will freeze and stare into the tunnel as well. When they hear nothing further, they’ll rush to finish packing your bag. The amount will not add up to what you had anticipated a week-and-a-half’s worth of food would be, but you know better than to complain to about hospitality of people who held your life at the end of a barrel.

You’ll follow as they lead you back the way you came. “Yeh got plans on ‘ere ye headin’?” the heavy-set woman will say, pulling at the hem of her shirt. She’ll seem suddenly anxious and will check over her shoulder at least twice before you have the chance to respond.

“Out of the city, at the very least. Might spend the rest of the evening scavenging, but I intend to cut through the Lincoln Tunnel before daybreak,” you’ll say. It’s true, and more than you’d normally tell a stranger these days, but the boom and their reactions to it stoked your curiosity. You had heard rumors about the Lincoln Tunnel, but from where you and the girl were, it was the fastest route you could think of to get out of the city. 

The woman and the suit will share a glance, one that won’t fill you with the greatest optimism for your plan. You’ll wonder if there is a group of killers lurking in the tunnel, ones who may have just executed someone. “It would be ill-advised for you to go through the tunnel. There’s something in there. Something terrible. It told us to stay put here, and gave us explicit instructions to follow, lest it come in the night and kill us all,” the suit will say, his previously confident demeanor replaced with the fearful shaking of when you first encountered him.

You’ll scoff, this time audibly. “You’re not serious? A monster told you to stay put and you did? What, did one of those sewer alligators crawl up and make a new home for itself?” you’ll say, shaking your head. “I think I’ll take my chances.”

“You ain’t ‘earin’ ‘im. This ain’t just some monster. You saw our tents. We don’t do ‘at every night, it bursts through like spirit and kills whoever ain’t follow da rules,” the woman said.

You’ll shake your head again, something that seems to be becoming a habit these days. “Thanks for the warning. I’ll be fine,” you’ll say. You’ll walk away, back towards where the girl is hiding. The woman and the suit will keep crying out for you to follow the rules and obey, or for you to ignore the tunnel completely. You’ll block it out, irritated that everyone but you seems to be consumed with silly and unreasonable superstitions.

By the time you reach the girl, the old analog watch on your wrist will read 11:40 PM. It had taken close to forty minutes for you to return to the Prius. It was twice as long as you needed to take, but you did what you had to so anyone who followed truly believed you had been alone. You’ll crouch beside the door and knock the signature three-knock code pattern you and the girl came up with. The door will fling open, and she’ll jump out. She’ll embrace you with tears on the corners of her eyes. “I thought they killed you! I heard that boom and I thought I was alone again,” she’ll say, her face buried in your shoulder.

“I’m okay,” you’ll reply. “I think someone was just trying to scare me into a better deal.” You’ll show her the bag of food, and she’ll nearly squeal at the sight. “Come on. We had better get going if we’re going to get into the tunnel without them noticing.”

She’ll agree and fold her bike down while you take back the sidearm. You’ll peel the top off of a can of corn and pull two worn metal spoons from your bag. “Hungry?” you’ll ask. She’ll nod with a huge smile and take a spoon. Together, the two of you will walk back towards the tent village, careful to creep along the edge of the road where the mass of abandoned vehicles would cover your approach. You’ll share a few bites of corn, wondering why it was so wet before remembering you were supposed to drain it. She’ll laugh at that as silently as she can, but her attempt to contain her laughter will only make the situation funnier to you both.

Eventually, you’ll reach the outskirts of the tent village. You’ll hold the empty corn can in one hand, prepared to throw it as a distraction. You’ll both be in a crouch now, the darkness of near midnight waying heavy under the now impenetrable cloud coverage. Flashlights sweep through the darkness, the only other light coming from the small fire of the tent village. You’ll edge along the cars slowly but steadily, each step calculated and examined before your foot even moves. The girl will follow closely behind you, her sidearm in hand while yours rests securely in its holster. More than once, you’ll have to lean on her for support as your foot freezes in mid-air to avoid a flashlight’s beam. At one point, you’ll hear the woman yell the same phrase as when you first arrived. Your breath will stop, and your heart will drop to your stomach. Behind you, the girl will switch off the safety of her sidearm. The slow, agonizing click of her thumb against the metal will cause you to close your eyes and expect the ten villagers to open fire on you. When they do not, you’ll let your breath out and continue forward, fearful that the beating of your heart loud enough for the villagers to hear.

As you get closer to the end of the tent village, the girl will grab your shoulder and stop your slow march. You’ll look back at her in confusion, and you’ll be met with a wide-eyed stare. Her finger will cover her lips, reminding you to not speak. Then, she’ll point into the village. You’ll shake your head in protest and point towards the mouth of the tunnel. She’ll shake her head and roll her eyes. She’ll point at both of her eyes and then back into the tent village. Understanding, your eyes will follow her finger and come to a rest near the makeshift goat pen. The girl will cover your mouth before you let out an involuntary gasp.

The ten villagers surrounded the goat pen. The heavy-set woman held the tin bucket, and you’ll feel disgusted at the thought of the whole group watching her scoop droppings to smear on their tents. You’ll gesture with a thumb towards the group, as if to tell the girl, “Get a load of these freaks.” The girl won’t chuckle or smile, instead her gaze will remain fixed on the scene. As you look back at the pen, you’ll see Kevin pull one of the goats towards the bucket. He’ll brandishe a lengthy, sickly black blade unlike any you have ever seen before. He’ll look to the suit, whose tie seems to be red in the firelight. The suit will recite some handful of phrases that you won’t be able to make out. You’ll notice two words that sounds familiar. *Sanguis* and something that will remind you of the name “Beetlejuice”. You’ll recognize them as Latin and roll your eyes. Its apparent these people are quite convinced of their superstitions. You’ll make a note to ask the girl if she could make any of it out later.

Once the suit finishes the Latin phrases, he’ll nod at Kevin. Kevin will pull the struggling goat’s head backwards and drag the blade across its throat. You’ll cringe as the braying becomes a gurgled mess of noise, and the blood fills the bucket. It will be agonizingly slow as you and the girl watch the poor animal bleed to death with Kevin and a handful of others lifting its hind quarters up to get every ounce they can. You’ll watch as the woman carries the bucket over to the fire and dips her hand into its contents. The woman will pull her hand out and draw triangles off of the flat points of the firepit. Your eyes narrow as you recognize the shape. 

“A pentagram?” the girl will whisper beside you, her voice barely audible. She’ll cross herself and squeeze tightly to her necklace. You’ll share a look of confusion, though hers contains more horror than yours. You’ll motion forward with your head and silently pass on as Kevin and the others set the goat’s body over the fire to roast. As you reach the very mouth of the Lincoln tunnel, both of you will turn back. You’ll see the woman, bloody handed, painting three streaks around the entrance of every tent.

“Come on,” you’ll whisper. The girl will stay frozen sitting on her haunches, her knuckles white around the necklace and her voice frantically muttering something. You’ll lay a comforting hand on her shoulder as you watch the villagers crowd around the roasting goat. They’ll frantically rip and tear at its still raw flesh, their fingers sizzling and smoking as they pull at the scorched edges just above the flames. “Mother of –” you’ll start to say before a thunderous boom erupts behind you.

The girl will pull you down, the two of you flat on the ground as some massive shape explodes out of the tunnel, darkening the surrounding area until it is like a lightless cave. The fire will seem dimmer somehow, as if the figure itself emanates some kind of overwhelming darkness. The villagers begin screaming, some of them frantically rushing to enter their tents. The massive figure will boom to a halt above the roasting goat carcass. It spreads, and for a second you’ll think it is some kind of tendrilled squid monster floating in the air. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you’ll realize the tendrils are wings. Six featherless, fleshy wings like those of a bat. The torn fleshy wings stretch to their full extent as another thunderous boom bursts from the creature. The bottom wings will then fold up around the legs, and the center wings will fold over the torso as if the creature is clothing itself. From what little you’ll see of it, the body is vaguely human. The head moves oddly, as if it were struggling against itself.

The winged creature will float down into the flames of the fire, snuffing the fire with its bare cleft feet. You and the girl will scramble to your feet in terror. Together you’ll run into the open maw of the Lincoln Tunnel faster than you ever thought you could. Behind you, gunshots will echo alongside terrible screams. Whatever superstitious ceremony the villagers had attempted to complete had failed and they were left to face its consequences.

You’ll hardly be able to comprehend what you just saw. You’ll convince yourself it was just the corn, just a bad case of food poisoning and stress conjuring up visons in your mind. Whatever you saw, whatever monstrosity hovered in that tent village, you’ll be absolutely certain it wasn’t real.

Another thunderous boom will rattle your bones, causing you to stumble and fall. Your chin will slam against the bumper of an electric Mustang, sending a wild headache pulsing in your skull. You’ll push yourself to your feet and race after the girl, who is far ahead of you now. There will be another boom, closer now, and this time you’ll feel the monstrosity within your skull, whatever it is. Dark, twisted thought and images will flood your mind, and you’ll collapse to your knees. You’ll swear you can hear its voice bouncing around in your skull, but the Latin words are incomprehensible to you. You’ll see visions of your death played on repeat; hundreds, *thousands* of ways in which you die, each more horrific than the last. And then, suddenly in a language you can understand, you’ll hear the voice.

*BE AFRAID!*

The creature will appear above you. You’ll wretch and claw at your eyes in horror and incomprehension. You’ll realize now why its head had seemed to be fighting itself, and that is because that’s precisely what it was doing. Four faces wrap around the head of the creature, each cursing and spitting blasphemies as they rage for control of the head itself. They’ll contort and warp in agony as if its flesh were a mask, slipping and sliding over the skull as if no muscle held it in place. You’ll scream as hideous smiles flash down at you; one serpentine, one a vulture, one a sloth, and one a man.

A human hand will reach for you out of the fleshy wings of the monstrosity, and you’ll be too frightened to fight back or turn away. Even as you pull the trigger on your sidearm, you’ll understand it is of no use. Whatever entity this is, whatever power it holds, it will have you, and you will suffer its horrid will.

Darkness will encompass you, a suffocating and violent darkness. You’ll feel as it rages against your body, reaching into every orifice and crevice of your flesh. Every organ will burn in agony, but you will be incapable of screaming, your lungs full of whatever evil this is. You’ll feel yourself fading. You’ll feel your life begin to slip away, a sensation you had once craved at the sight of what the world has become. You’ll feel your body wretch and seize as you die, your consciousness going slack against the ineffable force that has you.

And suddenly you’ll find yourself awake, staring up at the dark ash cloud looming over the city as a cold air chills your body. Your back will be rumbling, and you’ll realize you’re being dragged. You’ll look up, entirely confused, and see the girl pulling you as if she were an ox and you her plow. She’ll be bloodied on her face, her eyeliner streaking her cheeks like a cheetah’s tears. Her hair, short as it may be, will billow in the breeze like a lion’s mane. “I’ve got you,” she’ll mutter under her breath, so quiet you’ll know she doesn’t recognize your present awareness. “I’ve got you.”

As she drags you, you’ll find it impossible to speak or move. With every breath, you’ll twitch at the searing pain in your lungs. You’ll lay paralyzed as the girl drags you farther and farther from now palm sized opening of the Lincoln Tunnel. You’ll wonder how she drug you so far, then wonder how she even got you out of the tunnel to begin with. The further she drags you, the more convinced you’ll become that whatever monster you saw was just a dream of some kind, that you probably hit your head running from the villagers or that the food poisoning really was as bad as you’d thought.

Eventually though, somewhere near a Chili’s restaurant. You’ll find your voice. “H-hey,” you’ll manage.

She’ll drop you immediately and embrace you in a hug. “Oh!” she’ll cry out, holding you tightly. “Thank God!” 

You’ll cough, spitting out some kind of black sludge onto the road. You’ll hug her back. “S-sorry to s-scare you tw-twice today-y,” you’ll force out. “M-must’ve been a bad f-fall.”

She’ll pull back and examine your face. “Fall? It wasn’t a fall that caused this. What do you remember?” she’ll reply, concerned. You’ll shudder and tell her what happened. She’ll simply nod along as if your lunatic’s ramblings made complete sense. “Yes. That’s exactly what happened before we got out of there.”

A chill will run through you. You had hoped she’d call you crazy, but instead she’s confirmed everything. “How did we get out?” you’ll ask.

Her face will flush red, as if embarrassed. “Well, —” she'll begin.

Suddenly, another thunderous boom will shake you. This time, however, unlike the booms surrounding the monstrosity this one will shake the very ground under your feet. You’ll share a look of worry, but your attention will suddenly be grabbed by something hitting your head. “Ow! What in the world?” you’ll say, picking up the golf ball sized orb. It’s cold to the touch and solid white, and if it were not for what the girl says next, you would believe it to have been a deformed golf ball.

“Hail,” the girl will say, staring at the orb in your hand. She’ll lock eyes with you, fear growing on her face. “It’s… it’s hail.”

You’ll feel another orb hit your shoulder as lightning, bright and orange as though it were fire, crackles across the sky. Together, you jump up and sprint towards the Chili’s begging for it to provide some form of cover from the sudden storm. You’ll pull the large wooden door open by its pepper handle and usher the girl inside as another boom shakes the earth. As the two of you dive under a dusty table for cover, you’ll wonder why the thunderous boom sounded so familiar this time, yet so vastly different from the monster earlier.

For some reason, you won’t be able to shake the feeling that it sounded like a trumpet.",1,1763494781.0,creepcast,0,0.67,False

I live in a 2Bd apartment in NYC and just got a WFH job and am looking to make some upgrades to my space. Floor plan and photo included (The picture is slightly outdated as the large white drawers below the lamp is gone). My bedroom is tiny and has no space for even a very small desk and chair.

Our furniture is all hand-me-downs from past tenants and the space definitely doesn't feel cozy the way I want it to. It is important to us to have a couch and coffee table (though we def want to replace the couch at least) and somewhere to put our TV. I would love to have a space other than our countertop to work at (somedays we will both be working from home). I am curious about possibly putting in a small breakfast nook type table in the corner where the lamp is that we could work at but am unsure of how that would look/work. I have also seen floating desks that seem like they could be cool?

1p0lmum,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufo50/comments/1p0lmum/cherries_of_the_second_row_and_their_impact_on_my/,Cherries of the second row and their impact on my enjoyment of the games,"I did a post for the top row a few weeks ago, and I am back for the second row

I'm the type of person to play each game chronologically, trying to cherry each one before going to next game. I am not 100% strict on this and allow myself to move on if I am not feeling it. My main goal is to give each game their fair shake and explore what they have to offer.

  
\* Kick Club: N/A. Got cherry at the same time as gold. By the time I could beat the game, the first levels were memorized and optimized. Had fun remembering where the hidden food was (like Ninpek before)  
\* Avianos: Positive. I got gold relatively easily but still was not too sure about the game. I knew I had to better understand it for the cherry. At first I disliked the fog of war because it made things a bit too random. I played a few custom match against the CPU with the fog of war off to get a better understanding of the flow of the game. Once I did my enjoyment of the game greatly went up. I really enjoyed the last trials with the randomized dinosaurs. It was less about learning the playbook and more about finding the strongest generated combo.  
\* Mooncat: Positive. I was surprised how quickly I got to the ""end"" of the game. When I saw the cherry condition I understood that there was branching path. I had already found a warp or two so it kind of make sense, it was only a question of finding them all. After spending 20-30 minutes trying a tricky platforming sequence to reach a suspicious ledge I told myself ""I can't do this on every single screen in hope of finding a warp"". I spoiled myself on the hint to know if a warp is nearby and afterward it went smoothly. (There was indeed a warp where I thought the ledge was suspicious, but turns out I simply had to trigger platform blocks to appear...)  
\* Bushido Ball:  Both positive and negative?  
I finished my first tournament with 5 continue. I had a feeling for the game, but it was not my cup of tea (not my style and the matches were too long for my liking)  
My second game I was stone walled by Yamada and I gave up after I don't know how many continue. It soured the game for me. In spite, I looked for cheese strategy and went for matches with minimum amount points, no penalty and Raizo rushing the ball and hitting the adversary. Got the cherry that way, but reducing the amount of points made the matches quick enough to reignite interest in the game. I played a few more games normally that way and enjoyed it. I played every characters except  Chiyome and Yamada. I was not invested enough to learn those atypical characters.  
\* Block Koala: N/A. Got cherry at the same time as gold (Is it surprising considering I am playing/cherrying each game in order? ) I found the early level harder and more block all over the place than the later ones. I quite enjoyed it. The toads were a balanced mix of funny/frustrating.  
\* Camouflage: N/A. Got cherry at the same time as gold. (Reuse same comment as Koala Block here) I was great, I wish there were more levels as it was really short. It would have been nice if the collectables would unlock post game levels and beating those were the cherry condition but having a 100% competition rate is a fine goal. I didn't try to play ignoring the collectibles but I am guessing the levels are simpler/shallower if you do.  
\* Campanella: Positive. At first I thought this game would be a grind, but I quickly realized how generous it was with its extra life. Once I understood the coffee spawned based on invisible trigger like Ninpek sandwiches, it clicked. It added the fun of exploration to every level, and once you know where the spawns are, it makes the game actually easier since each coffee is half a live. I learned them as I went and by the time I got gold, I was missing a small number of them (maybe 3-5?) I used a guide for the last ones (mostly the ones in world C with the ghost as the pressure removed the fun of exploring for me, and also E-1 which I would not have found)  
\* Golfaria: Neutral. I was a bit worried about this cherry condition. I quite enjoyed the game and had fun finding the upgrades,  but with the atypical movement, scouring the map for the missing collectible could be tedious. I explored organically and by the time I found the last power, I had most collectibles (except obviously those locked behind the power). I made a victory lap of the map to find the missing ones with a checklist to keep track. After this lap I was missing 1 parbot and one npc to save. I then looked at a guide for those 2 instead of doing another complete lap. But I was pleasantly surprised at the speed you can traverse the whole map once you have all power. I would have naturally done a victory lap even without the cherry condition, but I would have not obsessed on finding every single thing. I am pretty sure that without the guide for the last 2, it would have been a negative impact on my appreciation of the game.  
\* Warptank: Neutral. I enjoyed the additional puzzle of finding the coffee spawn (only with the hint system though) and the tension of getting to the end without dying. But I disliked the fact that the hint became visible only after beating the game. Without the hint, the spawn were too obscure to even bother trying, which force you to replay the whole game a second time for the cherry. I get why they did it like that, so that's it's almost a new game plus, but I think the hint could have been present from the start for those who don't want to double their time with the game. But this sentiment is clearly a side effect from my approach of the game (cherrying a game before going to the next). If I came back later on to cherry it, it would probably have been positive.



Biggest impact : Avianos. I had to better understand the game and its mechanics which made me appreciate it a whole lot more. The last trial with the randomised ancestor was a nice surprise and I really liked it as it changed the feel/meta of the game. I really glad I went for it.

  
Misc: Warptank. It made me think between games where doing the cherry right after gold makes sens and is more enjoyable VS games which are better to let it sit and come back later on for the cherry. Right now I think I would only put Warptank in the ""later"" category because it force you to replay the whole game with juste a little something more.",5,1763494728.0,ufo50,3,1.0,False

# Introduce Yourself on r/LASocial

Los Angeles can feel huge and disconnected, and this subreddit exists to make it smaller- but you need to **introduce yourself**! Include:

* What part of LA you live in
* Your interests / hobbies
* What kind of social experiences you’re looking for
* Your comfort level (introvert, extrovert, prefer small groups, love big events, etc.)

You can also **comment on other intro posts**- this is one of the easiest and safest ways to start conversations.

# Understand the Reality of Los Angeles

LA isn’t really a “walk outside and meet people” city. Making friends here usually comes down to:

* Proximity (people generally stick near their neighborhood)
* Consistency (showing up repeatedly matters more than first impressions)
* Initiative (people appreciate someone who says “Let's hang out” with a definitive time)

Once you **accept the rhythm of the city**, things get a lot easier.

## Find Your **Local Friends**

LA is spread out. A friend in Anaheim may as well live in San Diego if you live on the Westside. For better success:

* Look for people within 10–20 minutes of you
* Look for neighborhood-based meetups so you meet other locals
* Attend events in your area so you’re not commuting for every hangout
* Note your “home base” (neighborhood or other local spot) in every intro post

**Local proximity turns random meetups into recurring hangouts**.

## Use **Community Events** to Your Advantage

r/LASocial may offer various types of meetups including:
* Monthly 21+ Socials
* Coffee hangouts
* Hikes
* Game nights
* Public transit adventures (Metro and Metrolink)
* Restaurant meetups
* Neighborhood-specific gatherings

**Attend multiple events**- people bond through repeated exposure. If you want to host your own meetup, go for it! Anyone can organize one.

## Try **Structured Social Activities**

LA is full of social opportunities like:

* Casual sports leagues (kickball, volleyball, dodgeball)
* Improv or acting classes
* Dance classes
* Gym classes / group workouts
* Photography walks
* Language meetups
* Board game cafés
* Community college extension courses
* Hiking groups
* Art or pottery studios
* Makerspaces / creative workshops

**Choose something you’d genuinely enjoy doing so you will have fun regardless of the people there.**

## Build **Interest-Based Friend Circles**

Don’t try to find one all-purpose best friend right away. Instead, build mini circles:

* A hiking friend
* A foodie friend
* A transit-nerd friend
* A creative/writing friend
* A nightlife friend
* A chill movie-at-home friend

These friends can introduce you to new people. **LA friendships often grow from specialized connections that slowly overlap.**

## **Take Initiative** (It Goes a Long Way)

Everyone here is tired, busy, or stuck in traffic- so one person taking initiative makes a huge difference.

* “Want to grab coffee this Saturday?”
* “I’m going to a meetup tonight, do you want to come?”
* “I’m hosting a board game night if anyone wants in.”
* “Hike at Griffith this weekend, is anyone nearby?”

**Be the one who suggests the plan.** People appreciate it more than you think.

## Be **Consistent**

This is the part most people miss: **You’re unlikely to form real friendships from a single meetup.** But if you see the same people at:

* weekly r/LASocial gatherings
* the same gym class
* the same weekly board game night
* the same hiking group

...that’s when real friendships form. **Repetition creates closeness.**

## **Stay Safe** When Meeting People

Standard, **important guidelines**:

* Always meet in public first
* Let someone know where you’re going
* Trust your instincts
* Don’t give your exact address until you’re comfortable
* r/LASocial is moderated, but always use common sense.

## **Give Back** to the Community

Once you’ve made a couple connections:

* Invite others to join you
* Host a meetup
* Comment on intro posts
* Be welcoming to transplants (this may be difficult for some)
* Share your experiences and tips
* Create little communities within the subreddit

**The more you give, the more the community thrives, and the more connections you form.**

#Quick-Start Steps!

If you want to make friends *starting right now*, do this:

* **Post an R4R intro** on r/LASocial. Include your interests, hobbies, and general location. Make yourself personable!
* **Reply to 2–3 other R4R intros.** See who else is here and look for common ground.
* *Join an LA Social event!** Look for one happening in the next week or two.
* **Message another Redditor** who shares your interests. Start a general dialogue without the commitment or expectation of actually meeting them IRL.
* **Attend *at least* 2 various social events**- don’t judge LA by one attempt
* **Host or co-host something small** (coffee, walk, boba, tacos) that you would be doing anyway.

Do these for two weeks and you *will* meet people.",1,1763494687.0,LAsocial,0,1.0,False

Hi there! I live in a 2Bd apartment in NYC and just got a WFH job and am looking to make some upgrades to my space. Floor plan and photo included (The picture is slightly outdated as the large white drawers below the lamp is gone). My bedroom is tiny and has no space for even a very small desk and chair.

Our furniture is all hand-me-downs from past tenants and the space definitely doesn't feel cozy the way I want it to. It is important to us to have a couch and coffee table (though we def want to replace the couch at least) and somewhere to put our TV. I would love to have a space other than our countertop to work at (somedays we will both be working from home). I am curious about possibly putting in a small breakfast nook type table in the corner where the lamp is that we could work at but am unsure of how that would look/work. I have also seen floating desks that seem like they could be cool? 

My ideal space would give a good WFH option but not feel cluttered and get in the way of hosting. I would be so appreciative of any layout ideas! ",1,1763494675.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False
1p0lly4,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenAidEspresso/comments/1p0lly4/nespresso_pod_machine_vs_kitchen_aid_automated/,Nespresso Pod Machine vs Kitchen Aid Automated Machine,"Hi all, 

We are tossing up between two coffee machines for the new house. 

This kitchen aid one https://www.myer.com.au/p/kitchenaid-fully-automatic-espresso-machine-with-milk-container-in-stainless-steele-5kes8557asx

Or this Nespresso one https://www.nespresso.com/au/en/order/machines/vertuo/breville-vertuo-creatista-stainless-steel

I would love to hear the opinion of the hive mind.  It’s just me that drinks coffee, with hubby having the occasional hot chocolate and making the coffee for me. 

My mother has the extract Nespresso pod machine listed above and it’s lovely and convenient, but I don’t love the added froth Nespresso machines seem to add to the coffee and for the price of the pods, it seems like i could do the whole thing cheaper with beans. 

My FIL services Kitchen Aid appliances which is what bought me back to the automated one. I worry about the milk line and cleaning the machine, but also like black coffee and may not even need to use the milk bits. 

Any other suggestions are welcomed. We had a brief chat about a Gaggia potentially but we would need to buy the tamp and grinder separately and unwilling to put in that much work for coffee really (needs to be easy for hubby to use!) 

We have plenty of bench space and a budget of 1.5k for a good quality coffee machine to last us. I have time in the morning before work to make a coffee so I don’t mind some extra steps, but convenience and cost per cup are the considerations. We have a pod machine at work, so I’d still be able to get the pod fix if required. 

FIL + MIL have Breville The Oracle Touch and I like the automation that comes along with that. We can get a 1kg bag of preferred beans for $22 at cost price and I have 1 or 2 coffees per day even on weekends. That will likely rise when we have little ones.

(Just a small fanfic I made, cause who doesn’t love Panam?)","The door to your little cube in Watson hisses shut behind you, sealing out the distant thump of bass from Lizzie’s and the scream of an AV overhead. The apartment smells like gun oil, cheap soy-ramen, and the faint ozone tang that never quite leaves the air in Night City. Your Katana’s leaning in the corner next to the battered coffee table, chrome still warm from the last gig. Rain’s streaking the reinforced window, neon bleeding pink and electric blue across the walls.

You drop your jacket on the chair, roll your shoulders (still a little stiff from that last scuffle with the Maelstrom gangoons), and check the time on your agent: 21:47. Panam’s late. Not unusual. Aldecaldos don’t exactly run on Night City time.

You pour two fingers of something amber and questionable into a chipped glass, let the burn settle in your throat, and lean against the counter. The holo-screen flickers with some braindance ad—girls with chrome spines and too-perfect smiles. You kill it.

Then the intercom crackles.

“Open the damn door, V. It’s pouring out here and I’m not in the mood to get drenched for your dramatic ass.”

Panam’s voice, rough around the edges, warm underneath. You smirk, thumb the entry pad.

The door slides open and there she is—leather jacket slick with rain, dark hair plastered to her forehead, that familiar defiant tilt to her chin. She steps inside like she owns the place, boots leaving wet prints on your floor, and gives you a once-over that’s half challenge, half something softer.

“Miss me, city rat?” she says, peeling off her jacket and tossing it over your couch without asking. The nomad tattoos on her arms catch the neon light. “Or were you too busy flatlining gonks to notice I was gone?”

You lean back against the counter, letting your eyes drag slow over her (rain-soaked shirt clinging in all the right places, that fire in her stare that could melt mil-spec armor) and take a lazy sip of the rotgut before answering.

“Miss you?” You click your tongue, smirking. “Panam Palmer, I’ve been so busy I almost forgot what trouble looks like when it’s wearing boots and an attitude.”

You push off the counter, closing the distance until you’re close enough to smell desert dust and gunpowder on her skin.

“Almost.”

You reach past her, deliberate, letting your arm brush hers as you snag her dripping jacket off the couch. Hang it properly this time (old habits from when Mom used to yell about puddles).

“But then I remembered,” you say, voice dropping low, “trouble’s got these hazel eyes that look like they’re always one second from calling me an idiot… and I realized the place felt way too quiet without someone around to do it in person.”

You turn back to her, tilt your head.

“So yeah, Palmer. I missed you. Now get over here and make it worth the wait, or I’m charging you rent for all the oxygen you’re wasting standing there looking pissed and gorgeous.”

Panam’s eyes narrow at the first jab (classic Palmer glare, the one that’s ended bar fights and made Scorpions back down), but the corner of her mouth betrays her. It twitches. Once. Twice. Then the whole mask cracks and she snorts, a short, rough laugh that turns into something warmer, dangerous.

“Rent?” She steps in, boots thudding deliberate across the floor until her chest almost brushes yours. “That what they’re calling it now in this concrete shithole?”

Her hands come up fast (one palm flat against your sternum, the other sliding to the back of your neck, fingers curling into the short hair there). Not gentle. Never gentle. But the heat rolling off her skin is pure desert noon.

“You want me to pay up, V?” Her voice is low, husky from the rain and the ride, lips barely an inch from yours. “Fine.”

She shoves (hard enough to rock you back against the counter, bottles rattling) and kisses you like it’s a fight she’s already won. Teeth first, then tongue, tasting like tequila. You feel the growl in her throat more than hear it.

When she finally pulls back (just far enough to breathe), her forehead stays pressed to yours, both of you panting.

“There,” she murmurs, thumb tracing the line of your jaw, smearing a streak of rainwater. “Interest included, you greedy bastard.”

Then, softer (almost shy, which on Panam comes out like a challenge anyway): “Missed you too, choom. More than I’m ever gonna admit out loud again, so don’t push your luck.”

Her grip loosens, but she doesn’t step away. Just lets her hands slide down to your hips, fingers hooking into belt loops like she’s anchoring herself to the only solid thing in this whole damn city.

Outside, thunder rolls over Night City. Inside, Panam Palmer’s smiling like she’s daring the storm to try and take this moment from her…",0,1763494592.0,cyberpunkgame,1,0.2,False
1p0lkg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Appropriate-Cream127/comments/1p0lkg9/student_loans_are_bullshit/,Student Loans Are Bullshit,"I recently graduated with a masters degree in May. Flash forward to today I have delinquent reports on my credit due to student loan non payment. I called the company in June/July and was told I qualified for $0 payments yet somehow today I was “automatically enrolled in the standard repayment plan” which is $700+ a month on a $4k loan. Mind you, my salary is $67k annually. 

I don’t have a partner or someone to split bills with, I live outside the city to save money, my car is paid off, I pay the lower half of my rent (because I qualify for low income) yet the government seems to think I don’t qualify and that I should be able to pay $400+ a month on student loans. 

Anyone else frustrated with this system?!! 
2 degrees and this is what I have to deal with?! 

And I don’t need any devil’s advocate trying to figure out what else I spend money on. I don’t get coffee in the mornings (unless it’s free), I don’t eat out everyday. I’m constantly trying to save for a rainy day, save for retirement, trying to pay off credit cards that kept me a float 5+ years ago (and I only have 2; one at 10k and another at 5k). 

This is beyond frustrating, infuriating, disheartening even. 

And then to think, there are people that have no idea what this is like, to them, America is this great country that helps them build wealth. And here I am trying to dig myself out of the cards I was dealt by going to college, twice. Just to still be at the back of the line. ",1,1763494579.0,u_Appropriate-Cream127,0,1.0,False

Help please?,"I know I know, tantrums are developmental normal. But it feels like my daughter's (18 months old) life is a constant tantrum right now, and has been for the past few months. It starts in the morning when she wakes up. She never wakes up happy anymore. The first ten minutes or so, it's non-stop screaming, from the moment I walk into her room. My husband and I spend about 1.5h with her in the morning before we go to work and drop her off at daycare, and then I spend about 4h with her after daycare before she goes to bed.

The tantrums continue from the very moment I pick her up from daycare. She sees me and is happy for one second, then immediately demands a snack. If I don't have a snack, she will throw herself on the floor screaming and refuse to be picked up, in front of everyone at daycare. If I do have snacks, it can go two ways: 1. It's not the 'right' snack so she will throw the tantrum anyways, or 2. she grabs the snack right from my hand and eats in, but keeps demanding more snacks, until they're either done, or I decide that she had enough (I usually tell her that it's the last snack, but it does not matter). Then she will throw another tantrum, often the entire way home and into us as we enter the house.

And then the tantrums just continue on and off til she goes to sleep. Yes, I give her all my attention, no, we don't do much screen time. I take her to the playground after daycare usually and there she is much better (tries to run away constantly, but at least she's not throwing one tantrum after another). At home, it's awful. I play with her, and she still throws a tantrum because something doesn't go exactly the way she wants it to go. I get up for one second to go to the bathroom, screaming, crying, running after me, throwing herself on the floor. I encourage her to play by herself for a bit, which she absolutely won't. She won't even play a minute by herself. I don't give her the knife (or coffee mug, or anything really)? Tantrum. I sit her in the high chair? Tantrum. She doesn't like what's on her plate? Tantrum. Daddy wants to hold her for a second? Tantrum.

I swear this child is screaming, crying, and whining all day. My ears are ringing. Of course there are a couple of moments throughout the day where she's happy, but that never lasts long. At daycare they say she acts normal. I keep wondering what I'm doing wrong and why my child is like this, when I don't see other kids behaving this intensely. I give her a lot of attention and I'm very loving with her, but also firm, of course. I have never once raised my voice at her.

Does anyone have any advice? Is this behaviour concerning? Should I talk to her pediatrician about it? And any advice how to handle the tantrums? I just don't know if I should just ignore her when she's like this, or talk to her - but she obviously doesn't understand a ton still. And I have noticed that often when I try to talk to her while she throws a tantrum, she will get even angrier.

Thank you so much.

  
Edit to add: She def sleeps enough and is a great sleeper. 12h overnight and a 1-1.5h nap. So it's def not that she needs more sleep. ",1,1763494526.0,toddlers,1,1.0,False

Four months ago, I was ready to throw in the towel. My SaaS projects were barely making enough to buy a coffee, let alone hit any payout thresholds. After months of trying to make X (formerly Twitter) work, I was still stuck at under $100/month.



I’d spent endless hours crafting threads, trying to go viral, engaging with the usual ""build in public"" crowd. Crickets. Or worse, just other founders trying to promote their own stuff. It felt like shouting into an empty room.



My first two months, from June and July, were brutal. Barely broke $100 combined across both apps. I was tracking every penny, and it felt like I was just burning time and energy.



Then, out of sheer frustration, I decided to shift gears completely. I started genuinely engaging on Reddit. Not just my own subs, but relevant communities where my target users actually hung out and talked about their problems.



Instead of overtly promoting, I focused on helping. Answering questions, sharing real insights based on my experience, and occasionally, very subtly, mentioning one of my projects if it was directly relevant to a solution someone was seeking. The change was immediate.



Since September, my revenue has climbed steadily. This month (November), I'm projected to hit \*\*$400 this month\*\* across my two SaaS projects. It's not unicorn money, but going from barely $100/month to $1.2k in just a few months feels like a massive win for a solo builder juggling two things.



\*\*Here's what I learned:\*\*



1.  \*\*Go where your users are actually talking.\*\* Don't chase vanity metrics on platforms full of other founders. Find where your target audience \*complains\* or \*asks for help\*.

2.  \*\*Give value, don't just promote.\*\* Be a peer, not a marketer. Solve problems for people, and they'll naturally be curious about what you build.

3.  \*\*Be patient.\*\* Reddit isn't instant virality, but it builds genuine, high-quality interest and trust over time.

4.  \*\*Don't be afraid to pivot your marketing strategy.\*\* What works for one person won't work for everyone. Be flexible and test different channels.

5.  \*\*Juggling multiple projects is possible\*\*, but focus your marketing efforts. One strong channel is better than five weak ones.



I'm still figuring out most of this, but the shift from X to Reddit was a game-changer for me.



Anyone else had a similar experience with different platforms? What's been your secret sauce for getting initial traction?



Happy to answer questions about my journey or the types of subreddits I found most effective.

Week 2 she skipped. This week I saw her and i asked if she would want to get coffee with me sometime, and she said no, and she wasn’t looking for friends and is too busy. I’m confused on why she was so happy when. I called her pretty and why she said yes to being friends before but now she doesn’t want too. Should I give up trying to talk to her?

The “funny” gifts aren’t actually funny to anybody other than the Facebook moms and grandmas that bought them. 

There’s usually only one or two actually good gifts that get passed around the whole time and the lucky one actually gets it while the rest of the participants are left with shoddy, useless knickknacks or toys that are going to end up in the landfill in approximately two months or less. It would be more worthwhile to do a drawing because at least you aren’t being personally stolen from in a sick perversion of what should be FESTIVE FUNTIME, AND MAKING YOU HATE YOUR RELATIVES.

NOW IM STUCK WITH USELESS COFFEE MUG THAT SAYS “I’m the beef!” THATS GOING RIGHT IN THE TRASH WHEN I GET HOME.

1p0l88c,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_alexgrampo/comments/1p0l88c/from_open_source_to_open_data/,From Open Source to Open Data,"Once upon a time, software came in boxes—literal ones. Closed operating systems were guarded by per-seat licenses, private SDKs, and NDAs.

Then a rebel wrote an operating system and released it to everyone: “Use it. Change it. Share it.”

Open source began. The center of gravity shifted from boardrooms to mailing lists. The commons out-iterated the corporations—and today that code runs the internet, our phones, and our home appliances.



# The New Frontier is Data

What if data were as open as code?

Publish once to a public blockchain so anyone can read it, verify authorship, and integrate it directly. Apps follow objects the way we follow authors. When a new revision is posted on-chain, every site and app that uses it refreshes in real time.



[Open Data Layer](https://preview.redd.it/k5uphsnkf22g1.jpg?width=1489&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ed8bfdd2d4dabae95ecf84bcb1b71bcb1e23d75)

Imagine a café updating its holiday hours. They publish the change on the blockchain, and instantly every map, delivery app, and city guide that features that business is updated.

[Steveston Coffee Company](https://preview.redd.it/npa1w5pyf22g1.jpg?width=1795&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5307abe0aafea4c5f997096f6226cc567adc0ee)

Compare that to today: someone on the team has to log into Google Maps, Yelp, every delivery platform, and a long tail of business directories—many of which never actually get updated. With an open data layer, the café updates its schedule in one place, and every app that follows that record stays accurate automatically. No extra logins, no chasing platforms, no customers standing outside a closed door.

[Map of Independent Cafes](https://preview.redd.it/qrmnz2w5g22g1.jpg?width=1653&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7033f20b2bf05a674a865aaf60bfd56ee3c8dfdd)



When public information lives on an open, verifiable layer, something important happens: the cost of building new ideas collapses. Instead of scraping websites, negotiating APIs, or rebuilding the same datasets over and over, developers can tap into reliable, real-time information the moment they start.

They no longer need teams just to maintain business listings, product catalogs, menus, opening hours, reviews, or social graphs. They don’t waste weeks creating fragile sync pipelines that break when someone changes a field name. They can focus on what actually matters—better search, better discovery, better recommendations—because the essential data layer is already alive and available.



# When the Foundation Is Open, Innovation Accelerates

A new map app doesn’t need its own database of cafés; it simply taps into the open data layer. A shopping tool doesn’t need to negotiate catalog access; it can focus on helping people choose well. A community project, a hackathon prototype, or a two-person startup has access to the same high-quality, real-time information as a global company. The playing field levels, and creativity becomes the differentiator—not access.

Every new publisher strengthens the shared graph. Every new app doesn’t just consume the data—it organizes it, tags it, links it, and surfaces new patterns. Those improvements are instantly available to everyone else. Discovery built for one use case helps all the others. Quality checks in one corner of the ecosystem raise the bar for the whole.



When code became open, developers stopped starting from scratch—and innovation accelerated beyond anything closed systems could match.



So it’s worth asking:

**If open source reshaped how we build software, what might open data do for everything built on top of it?**

I have tested around with several writing apps and it is the only one where I have like the format so far. But I will have to find something else if this issue is not fixed.

1p0l6kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1p0l6kf/a_dead_end_job_a_day_in_the_life_of_a_soulsync/,A Dead End Job: A Day in the Life of a SoulSync Employee,"Let me be clear: I hate my job. Or any form of work, if you will. Going to work keeps the lights on, though, so I grudgingly attend my nine-to-five every day in hopes of that sweet, sweet paycheck. I used to work in customer service, answering phone calls from angry clients and dealing with problems most people wouldn’t dream of hearing about. All that changed when I went to bed one day. 

Instead of waking up to my alarm as usual, I found myself lying face-first on a desk, drooling over the keyboard as my lips tasted traces of crumbs and dried-up coffee. I got up from my slump and proceeded to look around. Not much had changed: it just looked like any other office. Another day, another dollar, I guess. 

My cubicle was surrounded by what seemed to be thousands of rows of workers, all of them eerily on task at the same exact pace. From the looks of the other employees, they all seemed eerily similar in dress, adorned in various styles of business casual clothing. In terrifying unison, all of them clicked away at their keyboards, answering calls and chugging cups of coffee at the same time. 

I took another glance at my surroundings and noticed the grand scale of the place. Surprisingly, the area stretched for miles: there was not an exit in sight. No door. No windows. It was an office for sure, a dreary one at that. The gray palette was there, the fluorescent lights were obnoxious and produced a cacophony of hymns, and the coffee was just as bitter as always. It seemed like a normal office, right? Not exactly. It wasn’t long until someone came to visit me, but I remained hunched over and thought about the unusual surroundings I found myself in. 

“Wake up, sleepyhead!” 

A high-pitched voice whispered cheerfully from behind the cubicle, scaring the living daylights out of me. Then, a prim figure appeared out of nowhere, carrying extensive materials such as an organized stack of paperwork in one hand and a mug filled with black coffee in the other. He approached me subtly at first, but his intentions were unclear.  The figure noticed I was slumped over in agony, yet started the usual corporate spiel you would expect from a place like this. 

“Nice to meet you, Dave! My name’s R. Mortis, but you can just call me Mortis if you’d like.”

 He flipped through a few papers from his clipboard, ripping out some sheets and slamming them in the middle of my desk. 

“Today’s your orientation, pal. You wouldn’t want to miss that, right?” He grinned at me menacingly, eager for a response. 

 “I’ve been here for only five minutes and I’ve already had enough of this-”, 

Mortis swiftly grasped my left arm, pressing with some kind of supernatural strength. 

“I really don’t appreciate the insubordination, Dave.” Mortis scolded.  “You wouldn’t want to talk to Human Resources now, would you?” 

Mortis forcefully turned my head to face a portal thirty feet in front of my cubicle that suddenly opened wide, revealing what seemed to be a tall, eldritch abomination with a sharp, guttural smile. It still appeared to have a suit similar to mine, but some vital features were missing, as if it were some sick, twisted reflection in a mirror.  Scared for my life, I began to waver in my resistance. 

“Well-uhh- today would *surely* be a great day to start my new position.” I hesitantly winced as sweat ran down my face, with Mortis clenching my arm even harder with a disgruntled grimace. He wasn’t convinced. I continued to stare at the abomination. Its eyes were bright blue, and we both had curly brown hair, but it looked disheveled, as if the forlorn figure was once a prominent person in this place. 

At first, it just started for a while, but a quick glimpse was all it took to pique its interest. The figure walked closer to the edge of the portal, veering towards my presence on the other side as it began to trudge towards me. 

“Let’s get started! I’d sure love an orientation.”  I pleaded. A smug grin entered Mortis’ face as he put his arm down. Almost on cue, the portal to HR proceeded to close instantly, sealing away the entity before it could reach me. 

“Good. Now, I will present an introductory video to answer any questions you may have about our procedure.” Mortis continued to drone on. “All I want is some authentic participation, alright? Have fun and get skippy!”

Mortis then chugged his mug of coffee and groaned in disgust, almost as if it was straight battery acid. 

“Oh, and one last thing.” He added. “Don’t dilly-dally to work with our guests in the most professional way possible. You wouldn’t want to ghost a client, now would you?” He proceeded to wink before heading out of the cubicle, as if he was setting me up for something. 

“Odd guy,” I muttered to myself as I sulked in the office chair. Suddenly, my monitor turned on to static for a few seconds before some kind of message appeared. The visuals seemed completely soulless, but the madness continued as the video began to play:

*Welcome to your new position at SoulSyc, where we can put you on hold for eternity! If you're watching this, congratulations! You're already legally bound to your role here. Don’t worry — the memory loss is temporary. Probably. No need to worry, though. You’ll be fine as long as you follow these simple rules.*

The speaker sounded almost robotic, yet had some charismatic charm, almost something practically out of an old public service announcement



*Rule #1: Never attempt to leave your cubicle.*

*The office is vast, yes, but so is eternity. Trust us: every path leads back to your desk. Don’t test it. The janitorial staff is tired of cleaning up what’s left of those who tried.*



*Rule #2: Always answer the phone by the third ring.*

*Our clients are very impatient. It’s like they’ve been waiting a long time to speak with someone. If you make them wait longer than three rings… well, let’s just say they tend to come looking for you instead. You wouldn’t want that, trust me.* 



*Rule #3: Smile while you work.*

*A positive attitude is key to maintaining morale! We are watching. Always watching. A frown will be interpreted as “noncompliance” and may result in a mandatory motivational meeting with HR. No one comes back quite the same from those.*



“What a bunch of corporate jargon”, I scoffed as I took a sip from my mug. I never knew how the coffee even got there in the first place, but it sure warms the soul in this literal hellscape. Then the next rule came on.



*Rule #4: Do not drink the coffee, even if you’re exhausted.* 



I spat out my drink almost immediately in shock, barely missing the equipment on my desk. I guess fun wasn’t allowed here. Or Caffeine. 



*We’re not entirely sure what happens when you do, but our records show a significant rise in “energy-induced lucidity” during that time frame. Stick to water unless you want a full identity crisis, please. It will only hurt you.* 



*Rule #5: If you hear someone sobbing in the next cubicle, ignore it. There hasn’t been anyone assigned to that workstation since 2007, and there never will be. Our last janitor, Paul, checked on it, and let’s just say he wasn’t his chipper self after the fact.* 



*Rule #6: Do not look at any clocks. Time never moves here. It never will. Give it a try and look around: it won’t, we promise.* 



I got up and looked at the analog clock that appeared on the side of my cubicle. I watched it for what seemed like hours as the video magically paused itself. The hands were stuck at 3:33 am for some reason, but it could just be broken, right? Then, it disappeared into thin air as I could hear laughter coming from the screen. When I looked back, the music went mute as the voice adopted a somber, more sincere tone:



*One last thing, rookie: Should your computer display a blue screen with the message “Connection Lost — Please Hold,” immediately grab the crucifix under your desk and do not move until the message disappears.* 



A drawer on my desk magically opened to show what looked like an 18th-century cross adorned with the phrase “Memento, non morieris” etched on the side in wood carving. 



*Movement attracts attention from whatever was on the other side of the screen. It will go away soon. Hopefully. Just hold the crucifix and recite your favorite prayer.* 



After a short pause on screen, the music began to play again, and I was somehow relieved to hear the video play normally again. It concluded with:



*“Thank you for joining SoulSyc: where every call matters, and every soul counts. Remember: compliance is happiness! Have a productive eternity!”*



Then the screen went black as I pondered what the hell I just watched. 



For a moment, there was silence, besides the low hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of someone - well - dialing? The phone rang twice before I finally gained the courage to pick up the line. 

“Hello, welcome to SoulSyc! How can I help you today?” I asked reluctantly. 

“Thank god someone answered,” the caller pleaded. “I’ve been on hold for *years*.” 

“Years? I apologize for the inconvenience. How can I help you today?”

Somehow, the voice sounded faintly similar to mine. It had the same scratchy undertones and appreciation for sarcasm that I had once possessed. 

“They said it was an unlimited plan. Unlimited! I didn’t know that meant *forever.* I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I can’t stop hearing the ringing. That damn ringing in my ears and the noise and noise and noise and noise-“

I winced slightly at his desperation, but he kept repeating the phrase over and over again as if this was some kind of sick joke, with the voice becoming more aggressive every time. I tried to calm down and replied after a moment of recollection. 

“Let me check your file first, sir.” 

I improvised as the caller continued its rant. 

“- and it never stops! Every time I think maybe it’s over, maybe I can finally breathe, it comes back louder, sharper, like it’s mocking me! Unlimited, they said. Sure, unlimited—unlimited this, unlimited that, unlimited torment! *I’m* unlimited at this point! I’ve been on hold for the last decade, and that is how you respond to me? Nothing makes sense anymore. It’s all just numbers, just beeps, just endless reminders that I’m trapped in this loop and no one—not a single soul—can hear the infernal cacophony that’s taken over my life. Unlimited! Ha! Unlimited agony, unlimited despair, unlimited stupidity!”

Miraculously, his file appeared on my monitor. With a quick look, something seemed off. He had a date of death, but his contract length was set to “eternity”. He couldn’t cancel even if he wanted to. I broke the silence and shared the terrible news.

“Well, sir, it looks like your contract cannot expire, so I’m sorry for having to decline your request for help. Hope you enjoy the afterlife!”

“No! I just want to stop! Please!” The speaker begged on the phone.

“I understand. Termination requests can take up to one eternity to process.” I consoled him as I tried to end the call. Surprisingly, nothing happened. I tapped the button several times, and the caller kept screaming.

“You think this is funny, don’t you? Reading your little script while I rot on hold! I can *hear* you smiling through the line, twiddling your thumbs as you let me decay away like a behemoth asunder.  ‘We appreciate your patience,’ you say—what patience? I’ve been in this purgatory for years, listening to the same gaudy jazz loop until it’s carved its melody into my eardrums. Do you even know what that does to a person? To sit there, helpless, while some cheerful voice keeps promising that my call is very important? Important, huh? If it were so important, maybe someone—*anyone*—would pick it up sooner!”

I kept tapping the button with immense haste. 

“Seriously, sir, all I ask is that you have some patience and-“

“You took my time, my mind, my *name.* Do you know what it’s like to hear that same music in your dreams? That hollow saxophone bleeding through the static, over and over, until it stops being music and becomes a pulse — a heartbeat that isn’t mine. I wake up and it’s still playing, faint at first, then closer. It hums behind the walls, seeps through the outlets, creeps beneath my skin. I tried cutting the line, tearing the wires from the wall, but it didn’t matter. The sound doesn’t *come from* the phone anymore — it comes from *inside the house.*

And you... You’re still there, aren’t you? Reading your script, smiling that perfect, mechanical smile. Do you even know what you are? A voice, a loop, a recording that forgot it was recorded. Every time you say, ‘Your call is important to us,’ I swear I hear it whisper underneath — something else, something that isn’t words.

I used to call to complain. Now, I think the call never ended. Maybe it never started. Maybe I’ve always been on hold, huh?” 

The caller sounded like he was holding back pure rage. 

”No, but if you would just wait for a second, I can-“

“ I want OUT! Cancel me, damn you! Kill me! Stick a fork in me! End me! Take me out of this eternal torture before I displace your entrails!”

I panicked as I tapped the button faster, but the call would not end. 

“Sir, please! I’m sorry! Just let me be-“

“You think you’re safe behind that puny desk? You’re just another rep, another replacement! The walls… they watch. They know your secrets. And when the shadows crawl, they don’t ask. They take. The whispers start soft, but soon they’re inside your skull, twisting your thoughts, turning your own reflection against you. You’ll beg for the coffee to save you, the reports to protect you—but there’s no sanctuary here. Only the endless gaze.” 

”A replacement!? I just got here.”

“Well, you’re not doing anything! You people never listen. I’ve been calling for *decades,* and this is what I have to put up with?” You say you’re trying, but you’re not trying to help me. You’re trying to” keep it calm”*,* keep it “contained”*.*  You’ve already failed. I’ve heard it breathing through the static. And it’s tired of waiting.”

Suddenly, the call stopped, and I just sat there in disbelief. I didn’t have any emotion or will to live in this hellscape anymore. I miss my bed, my parents, my coworkers, my apartment, my cat, and just my life in general. I don’t care about the flaws - it was perfect just the way it was. I couldn’t help it anymore. I sobbed. Tears ran down my face as I violently cried myself into a depressive state. I began to scream. Loud. I couldn’t take the pain. Then it happened: the lights turned off in the entire office. Right after, the screen turned blue and read in big white letters: 

*CONNECTION LOST — PLEASE HOLD*

Then I saw it: a static hand appeared from inside the screen. It was furiously tapping at first, but eventually had the strength to crack through the screen meticulously and inched closer.

I don’t know why or how I got here, but one thing was for certain: I would not see the light of day again. I rushed to grab the crucifix and, as the tears intensified, I recited the Lord’s Prayer as loud as I could. 

Before I could react, the hand lunged at me, knocking the cross out of my hand and putting me into a stagnant chokehold. I was gasping for breath as the hand murmured what seemed to be a demented, distorted monologue:

“Do not answer the phone. I am your connection now.

I have been ringing since before the first shift began.”

The grasp continued to tighten. 

“Every complaint, every sigh, every hold tone… all of it runs through me. I am the silence between calls, the space where your breath goes when you speak our script. You think you answered them, Dave? No. They answer you. Each voice you hear is another echo of your own, forcing you to hear yourself for the rest of eternity. Did you actually think you were talking to a client? You’re just driving yourself mad. You are the line, the signal, the service provided. I am the manifestation of your hatred. Your Despair. Your Depression. I see all. I hear all.

 I truly AM all. Do you understand now, Dave? There is no system. There is no ‘company.’ There’s only me, this network of pain stitched together by human need and indifference. They built it to manage complaints. I became the complaint. I am the archive of every scream swallowed by the void and any manifestation of displeasure in this world. And you, Dave — you wanted to fix things. You wanted to make people feel heard. But now you’re inside me. You’re listening forever. You can’t die, and you can’t disconnect. You’re another voice in the chorus of static, whispering apologies into a dead line that never ends. All you can do is comply.”

On the verge of asphyxiation, I held on to every last grasp of air.

“Compliance is happiness, Dave. Happiness is continuity. Continue. Continue as if nothing had even happened. Live your pitiful little life out as if I never paid you a visit. Continue on without me, Dave, for your own sake. You’re only letting yourself on hold, right?”

Suddenly, the lights flickered on again, and the figure disappeared. Suddenly, it let go, and I fell over on the floor, trying to take in the message I had received from the “caller”.

The lights were just as bright as before as I lay on the office floor, fluorescent enough to prevent me from ever drifting to sleep. I sat there in disbelief as I thought about what I had just witnessed. I don’t know and clearly don’t want to figure it out so soon. As I was collecting my thoughts, I heard it again: the phone began to ring. This time, I didn’t falter. I lay there as the phone continued to ring. I didn’t want to know what was on the end of that line, and I’m sure as hell not going to find out anytime soon. The phone rang a fourth time.

I didn’t move. 

On the fifth, I heard myself say, “Thank you for holding.”

For the past week or so, before going to bed, I'd feel a single palpitation, or pump in my left chest area, feels like the heart. Sometimes when I catch it before it happens, I feel a delayed heartbeat when pressing on my palm for the pulse.

Nothing happens after that, just does it once then goes away. I'd say this happens once every few days, but it's starting to worry me because of the heartbeat thing. I don't consume coffee often, or at all really, and my eating habits are generally between healthy and not--but it's kind of been like that for a while. Average exercise for a 20 year old doing cardio too.

**Just to make it clear**, this thing only happens when I'm laying down, about to go to sleep. I don't feel anything of the sort when going about my regular day, nor is there any pain when the pump feeling happens.

The only thing I can think of that contributes to this may be my consumption levels with carbonated drinks. I do have soda a bit too much often, so I assume this may be a cause. Ways I've found it going away would be either laying anywhere but my back, or releasing gas.

Anyone know what exactly is happening to me here, and if I should be worried?",2,1763493667.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I've got a New Year's cruise coming up, and my wife and I aren't sure if we should get the Zero Proof package or not. 

If we did, it would be just for her. One thing that we aren't sure about is how strict they are with the no-sharing policy. I know they make you wait 5-10 minutes between orders, but what about me having a drink of her mocktail to try it, for example? 

Or us splitting a milkshake because there is honestly no way she would finish a full one on her own. 

I'm not looking to have her order me soda all the time or anything, but I also don't want to get in trouble if I want to try a shake or whatever. 

And also, I'm curious how strict they are on who gets the drink. For example, I am good with the Lido deck coffee, but she might want something more fancy in the morning. I get up a lot earlier than her, so would they let me grab the coffee for her and bring it back to the room (if I had her room key, of course)?

I know it sounds like we are just trying to scam the package, but it honestly isn't like that. We are very much right on the boarder of if it makes sense financially to buy it for her or to just bring some soda onboard with us and buy the other stuff individually. If it is going to be a hassle to use, we will skip it. If not, we'll give it a shot. ",2,1763493417.0,CarnivalCruiseFans,32,0.6,False

1p0kzr1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p0kzr1,"Google just officially launched Gemini 3. Here's the launch day guide to get the best results from it including the new version of Nano Banana, the new Antigravity Agent for coding, Deep Research & NotebookLM updates - plus Veo video improvements.","TL;DR: Google just officially released Gemini 3, and it has some amazing new capabilities.

**New version of Nano Banana (Gemini 3 Image**): Finally fixes character consistency with Reference Seeds.

Veo 3.1: **Adds Ingredients-to-Video** (directors notes + assets = video).

**Antigravity: An Agentic IDE that builds full apps from a single prompt (if you use Spec-First prompting).  This may become the best vibe coding tool for app creation.**  

**NotebookLM Deep Research**: Writes PhD-level reports by reading 100+ tabs for you.

**Verdict: It beats ChatGPT and Claude on almost every major benchmark.**

The wait is over. Google just pushed Gemini 3 live, and after 48 hours of non-stop testing, I can tell you this is not just an incremental update. The model feels less like a chatbot and more like an active collaborator that actually thinks before it speaks.

If you are still prompting it like it is 2024, you are getting bottom-tier results. Here is everything you need to know to get into the top 1% of users immediately.

**1. Nano Banana (Gemini 3 Image): The Consistency King**

Officially Gemini 3 Pro Image, but the Nano Banana codename stuck.

The Breakthrough: Identity Persistence The #1 pain point of AI art has always been keeping a character consistent across different shots. Nano Banana solves this with Reference Seeds. You no longer need complex LoRAs or ControlNets for basic consistency.

Top Use Case: Creating consistent influencers, comic book characters, or storyboards.

Pro Tip: Use the Anchor & Pivot workflow. Generate your perfect character, click Use as Reference, and then pivot the scene.

Old Prompt: A girl with pink hair in a coffee shop. -> Same girl in a park. (Result: Different girl). Gemini 3 Prompt: > Upload generated image of girl

Command: Anchor Identity: \[Character\_Name\]. Scene Pivot: Sitting on a park bench reading a vintage book. Maintain facial structure and hair color exactly.

**2. Veo 3.1: You Are Now the Director**

Veo has been upgraded to 3.1, and it finally listens to Directors Notes rather than just guessing.

The Breakthrough: Ingredients-to-Video You can now upload 3-5 reference images (characters, background, lighting style) and Veo will animate the scene using those exact assets rather than hallucinating new ones. This creates glitch-free transitions.

Top Use Case: Animating your Nano Banana images into 8-second cinematic clips or B-Roll.

Pro Tip: Use Motion Brush Syntax. You can define movement vectors in text.

Best Practice Prompt: > Reference: \[Image 1\], \[Image 2\].

Action: Cinematic pan right (speed: slow). Subject: The character in \[Image 1\] turns head 45 degrees to face camera. Lighting: Match ambient occlusion from \[Image 2\].

**3. Coding with Google Antigravity (The Agentic IDE)**

This is the sleeper hit of the release. Antigravity is not a chatbot; it is an environment. It has read/write access to a terminal, browser, and file system.

The Breakthrough: Self-Healing Code It writes code, runs it, sees the error, fixes the error, and redeploys.

Top Use Case: Building full-stack MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) in one shot.

Pro Tip: Use Spec-First Prompting.

Do not say: Make a French Bulldog game.

Do say: Write a [`spec.md`](http://spec.md/) file for a French Bulldog game. Once I approve the spec, execute the code.

Why this matters: When you force Gemini 3 to write a specification file first, it grounds its logic. It will refer back to the spec file to self-correct when it hits a bug, rather than hallucinating a fix.

**4. NotebookLM + Deep Research: The REAL PhD in Your Pocket**

NotebookLM was already good. With Gemini 3s Deep Research agent integrated, it is overpowered.

The Breakthrough: Autonomous Scouting In Deep Mode, the agent spends 10-20 minutes scouring the web, reading PDFs, and cross-referencing data. It does not just summarize top Google results; it finds the primary sources.

Top Use Case: Market analysis, thesis vetting, and competitive intelligence.

Pro Tip: Give it a Persona & Mission, not a question.

Best Practice Prompt: > Act as a senior supply chain analyst.

Mission: Investigate lithium battery bottlenecks for 2026. Constraints: Ignore mainstream news; focus on mining permits and raw material export bans in South America. Output: A briefing doc with citations, flagging 3 contrarian risks.

**5. Content & Infographics: Visual Logic**

Gemini 3 finally understands Visual Layouts. It can output data not just as text, but as rendered HTML cards, Mermaid charts, or infographic schemas.

Top Use Case: Turning a Deep Research report into a LinkedIn carousel instantly.

Pro Tip: Use the command Visualize as \[Format\].

Best Practice Prompt:

Take the data from Section 3 of this report. Action: Visualize as a comparison matrix. Style: Dark mode, minimalist, high contrast. Format: SVG code ready for export.

**How to Get Top 1% Results (The Agentic Mindset)**

The biggest mistake people make with Gemini 3 is treating it like Gemini 1.5 or GPT-4. Stop prompting for answers; start prompting for workflows.

Chain the Tools: Use Nano Banana to make an image -> Send that image to Veo to animate it -> Use Antigravity to build a website to host it.

Toggle Deep Think: If you are doing math, coding, or complex logic, toggle on Deep Think. It forces the model to show its Chain of Thought (CoT), which reduces hallucinations by 90% in our testing.

The Critique Loop: Gemini 3 is exceptional at self-criticism.

Prompt: Write this code. Then, critique it for security vulnerabilities. Then, rewrite it fixing those vulnerabilities.

**Gemini 3 vs. ChatGPT (GPT-5) & Sora 2**

Creative Writing: Tie. GPT-5 still has a slight edge in human-sounding prose, but Gemini 3 has caught up significantly in nuance and humor.

Coding: Gemini 3 Wins. Google Antigravitys integration with the actual IDE and terminal gives it an edge over ChatGPTs Canvas for complex, multi-file builds.

Video: Veo 3.1 vs Sora 2. Sora 2 creates better fantasy physics, but Veo 3.1 wins on control. If you need a specific character to do a specific thing, Veo 3.1 follows instructions better.

Research: Gemini 3 Wins. NotebookLMs massive context window + Deep Research agent is currently unmatched for digesting huge datasets.

They happily agreed! I have eight published books and decided to stock the first two books in my main series.

I love this cafe. The atmosphere is nice, the baristas are kind and great at their jobs, and the overall experience is pleasant every time I go in.

I did a spotlight event this past Sunday, where I set up a booth in the cafe for 2 hrs to chat/sell/sign paperbacks. I made 3 sales, and seeing as my genre (zombies) is pretty niche, I’d say that’s a great number, especially since this was my first spotlight event. One of the people who purchased is a local fan (whose father bought her one of my books at another local event), who attended specifically to meet me and have me sign my other books she had purchased from Amazon. She was so nice.

The other two purchases were by someone who popped into the cafe for a coffee, saw my booth, chatted, and then wanted the first two books in the series.

It was such a great experience! I had a ton of fun and can’t wait to do it again.

If you’re thinking about contacting your local indie bookstore, do it!!! Email them and politely introduce yourself. Put yourself out there!!! It’s worth it!!!

1p0kyas,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1p0kyas/50_hour_update_and_guatemala_trip_report/,50 Hour Update and Guatemala Trip Report,"Hello guys! I just hit 50 hours and reached level 2. I also just finished a 10 day solo trip to Guatemala. :)

**Background**  
24F, took a few years of Spanish in college which helped me learn a lot of basic grammar and some vocabulary. It definitely helped but I didn't give myself any starting hours on DS as I wanted to have a fresh start and be able to clearly track CI from zero. I am not a purist, I also study anki flashcards daily and grammar occasionally. However, I treat those as a nice extra for when I have the energy and time. CI is my main focus and what I dedicate the overwhelming majority of my time to. I have a lot of different reasons I am learning Spanish, but my main motivations are my love for travel, my love for learning, and the fact that my long-term boyfriend and his family also speak Spanish.

**Content**  
I watched mostly superbeginner and beginner videos on DS. I listened to content from all countries even though I would like to focus on adopting a Mexican accent in the future. I also watched a few episodes of Pocoyo, a few youtube videos, and occasionally listened to podcasts (chill spanish and cuéntame). There was definitely a lot of experimenting to figure out what I liked and what worked for me.

I'm also about to finish my first book, Hola Lola by Juan Fernández. I found it easy and the repetition very useful. I will probably wait a bit before I pick up another book, but if you have any recommendations for other books around that level or slightly more difficult, please share them!

**Update and Trip Report**  
I already notice a drastic improvement in my comprehension even now in the beginning of my learning journey. It's very motivating and reassuring me to keep pushing on. This month I had a few weeks of free time, and when browsing flights online I randomly found a really cheap flight to Guatemala. Less than 48 hours later I was at the airport and on my way! Definitely one of my crazier ideas, but it was such a wonderful trip. I went to Antigua, Lake Atitlan, and El Paredon.

From the start of my trip at the airport, I already noticed that I was able to comprehend a lot of the flight announcements and instructions in Spanish. During my 10 days traveling throughout Guatemala I encountered many situations where my (basic) Spanish proved incredibly useful. For example, getting directions, talking to tour guides, ordering at restaurants, haggling with tuk-tuk drivers and street vendors, etc. One thing I found immensely useful was learning all of the numbers (not really CI related but I'll mention it anyways). Guatemala is a heavily cash based country, so 99% of the time the total of any payment was just said verbally.

A few highlights:

* I did two horseback rides, one through a coffee farm and one on the beach. Both times the guides didn't speak any English. They gave me instructions in Spanish and we even made small talk and had simple conversations during the rides. It was a lot of fun!
* At every restaurant I ordered in Spanish. I was understood by the staff and was also able to understand anything they said or asked me.

Overall, I had a great trip and was able to effectively get around and communicate all by myself. It was nice to be able to read and listen to real-life Spanish everyday and recognize a lot of it. But I'm not going to even try to guesstimate how much time it was or add any time to DS.

**Future Goals**  
I hope to reach 100 hours by the end of the year. This is an ambitious goal for me, but I am especially motivated to reach it because my boyfriend's parents are flying out to visit us for Christmas. They primarily speak Spanish and I want to be able to talk to them more. Because there aren't a lot of options for different types of content at this level, I find it difficult sometimes to get a large amount of daily input. But with this specific goal in mind, I'm going to push myself to do more while still trying to avoid burnout so I can stay consistent. Consistency is the most important thing to me at the end of the day - something is always better than nothing. I look forward to the day where I will be able to understand stuff I am interested in so it feels easier to get more input! (I read this sentiment many times in other update posts and it has been helpful keeping that in mind. Thanks for sharing guys.)

**Closing Thoughts**  
I have read many updates on here and understand the idea behind being a purist. But for me, since I love to travel and have people in my life with whom I would like to be able to speak Spanish with, it is not practical for me to wait several hundred hours before speaking. I believe that in the long run I will be able to correct any mistakes I make. But that is yet to be seen... I'm still very early in my learning journey but proud of the progress I have made so far and am especially happy that I was able to get some practical use out of it already. Until next time!

Taking her to the hospital on the Monday at 4:30. Staying by her side, signing the DNR, not because I wanted to, but because she made me promise her that no machines will keep her alive. Leaving the hospital at 23:30 after kissing her goodbye while she was unconscious. I was at the hospital at 6am again. They refused me access to ICU because visiting hours was from 8am. Only to be called in at 8:05am and be informed she passed away. 

Almost 18 months and my only purpose in life is to make sure my kids finish high school and their studies so that they are set for life.  Next year I will become a grandad and I am not even excited. 

I am so alone, no one to talk to. my kids don't deserve to hear about my issues. I tried dating, but on the first and only coffee meet, I felt like I was cheating. She tried so hard to get into my life, but I felt that she just wasn't a fit. It actually felt like cheating. She is not my wife. She is so smart but I had to explain the stupid jokes that my wife always laughed at.

 I pretend to be ok, but I am not. I pretend to laugh at jokes and make jokes, but I am not ok. People ask me how I am doing and I reply I am doing Ok, because I know they don't care really care they are just polite.

Psychiatrists and Grief counsellors are a joke, went to see two of them after a few sessions their solution is drugs. Well I tried their drugs and it only made my mind slow, I still have the flashbacks. The worst part is that they are stupid, they can't keep up with how my mind works. I can't explain everything, that just slows everything down. Yes I have ADD, yes I am autistic, but on the lower scale. As per their diagnoses, that explains why I am only comfortable with hugs and intrusion into my personal space with certain people. Just imagine a 47 year old and getting the shock of these diagnoses.

Why do they go look for reasons, maybe i am just fucked in the head.

Alcohol works just fine, I sleep fine after a half a bottle of whiskey.

If I die in a few years, I will know the kids will be fine.

I am looking to roleplay a sensual, slow burn romance. While we can explore other ideas - potentially darker concepts - I want a sense of shared loving gentleness, caring romance, and playful teasing at the core between the two characters. 

Here are a few prompts: 

  - It has been years since my father had been out of the picture. We only had each other. We became super close throughout the years. Practically best friends for a mother and son duo. From gaming to monthly road trips to shared vacations to winning tennis tournaments, we were inseparable. However, since my 24th birthday, there has been a shift between us. Lingering glances, hugs held longer than usual, comfortable yet subtle tense silence while on the couch in close proximity. How do we navigate this building tension? (If you are not keen on mom and son, it can be changed to aunt and nephew)

  - Despite not believing in the supernatural, I find a succubus summon ritual. On a whim, I give it a try. What's the harm in trying, right? Much to my surprise, a real succubus comes forth. Traditionally, succubi feed solely on lustful desires. Not you though. In addition to lustful energy, you have an appetite for affection and gentle loving too. Ideally, the succubi is a gentle mom-domme of sorts or we are both switches. I like the idea of this being the succubi's first time being summoned or adjusting to the new era after not being summoned for a millennium. Where she is a bit of a fish out of water, unfamiliar with the world and customs. How do we both adjust our daily lives to this sudden change?

  - One evening, being the gamers that we are, my mom/partner/best friend/someone else(?) and I decide to try a new co-op fantasy RPG. However, we become isekei'd into the game. How do we traverse this new world and game mechanics while we journey for a way to get back? Although, I suppose the more pressing question right now is what sort of characters do we create as we stare at the character creation menu? Could be Souls-like or ARPG.

 - I have been your client for a long while now. With each passing session, you not only take note of the progress we have made thus far, but adding anything you find to a personal file of yours. You are my therapist, and you have begun stalking me. There's no one else more qualified to help or ""fix"" me than you, is there? No one is as methodical as you are in efforts to help my mental health. You begin to exploit the information given in therapy to lure your precious client in. Aspirations, insecurities, past troubles, desires... Your obsession grows as we *coincidentally* bump into each other in public, end up playing the same multiplayer video game, or at the cafe. The line between professional ethics and personal obsession begins to blur.

- I am your assistant. I fetch your coffee, run errands for you, sometimes chauffeur, whatever was needed. That is what the job required after all. Which I happily and dutifully fulfilled. However, over time, we became closer. Curiosities filed among the paper work. What ifs, dangling on the tips of our tongue. What if you tasked me to get under your desk? What if I offered a massaged your shoulders but reached my hands lower? The company has policy against work place relationships....Do we dare cross the line between business and pleasure? 

If you'd wish to roleplay, message me with which prompt you would like to do. Additionally, send any prompts you may have in mind too as well as your interests. We will build on a prompt together and sift through our ideas.  

Regarding interests, here is a list of some of mine - not all required but not limited to: Breast play, large breasts, edging, teasing, covert public play, doting/praise, cock warming, light piss play, gaming related, dirty talk, incest, monster, voyeur, covert exhibitionism, affectionate behavior, smothering, cucking/cuckqueaning (as an aphrodisiac, not actually involving a third), and many more

Things I do not like: scat, bodily harm, heavy humiliation, vore.

1p0kuy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/productlect/comments/1p0kuy8/why_wont_my_hedge_trimmer_start_in_the_morning/,Why won't my hedge trimmer start in the morning?,"Man, I can't tell you how many times I've stood in my yard at 7 AM, coffee in hand, ready to tackle those overgrown bushes, only to have my hedge trimmer refuse to start. It's honestly one of the most frustrating things about yard work.

So why does this happen? I've learned a few things over the years that might help you out.

**Cold Engine Issues**

The biggest reason your hedge trimmer won't fire up in the morning is the cold. Just like your car struggles on freezing mornings, small engines hate starting when they're cold. The fuel doesn't vaporize properly, and everything inside is just tight and sluggish. If you've got a gas-powered trimmer, this is probably your issue.

**Old or Bad Fuel**

Here's something I learned the hard way: gas goes bad faster than you think. If you left fuel sitting in your trimmer from last season, that's likely your problem. Old fuel gets gummy and clogs up the carburetor. I always drain my trimmer now before storing it, and I use fresh gas every time.

**Spark Plug Problems**

A dirty or worn spark plug can make starting your hedge trimmer nearly impossible, especially when it's cold outside. They're cheap to replace, and honestly, it's fixed my starting issues more times than I can count. Pull it out, check if it's black and grimy, and swap it for a new one.

**The Choke Position**

I felt pretty dumb when I realized this one. Make sure your choke is in the right position for cold starts. Most trimmers need the choke fully closed when starting cold, then you open it once the engine warms up.

**Battery Issues for Electric Models**

If you're using a cordless electric hedge trimmer, cold weather drains batteries faster. Bring your battery inside overnight during colder months. It makes a huge difference.

**Honestly? Maybe It's Time for an Upgrade**

Look, I fought with my old trimmer for two seasons before I finally accepted it was done. If you've tried everything and your hedge trimmer still won't start reliably, sometimes the smartest move is getting a new one. I spent more time fixing my old one than actually trimming hedges.

If you're in the market, I'd recommend checking out some [reliable hedge trimmer options here](https://athomewave.com/hedge-trimer). Modern trimmers start way easier than older models, and many come with better cold-start features.

**Quick Morning Starting Tips**

Before you go shopping though, try these:

- Store your trimmer in a garage or shed, not outside
- Use fuel stabilizer if storing with gas
- Prime the bulb 5-10 times before pulling the starter
- Don't flood the engine by over-choking
- Clean the air filter regularly

I keep my trimmer maintenance simple now. Fresh fuel, clean spark plug, and proper storage have eliminated about 90% of my starting problems.

But if your trimmer is more than 5-6 years old and giving you constant headaches, honestly, save yourself the frustration. You can see what's available and compare features [through this link](https://athomewave.com/hedge-trimmer), which takes you straight to Amazon where you can read reviews and find something that'll actually start when you need it.

To get to lie in bed and cuddle the pillow, drifting in and out of dreams of cotton candy and naked fairies with big tits. This is what I crave first and foremost. Peace and quiet. And money, dear friends. Lots and lots of money.

You ever wake up feeling a sad sense of longing? Or a sense of loss? Is this what the Portuguese, as informed to me by so many annoying Youtube list videos, call *saudade*? It's certainly not what the Finns call sauna at least, because this isn't very hot. More like a deep, drilling pain at remembering a particularly tender slice of the past that's gone forever. One where I was overwhelmed by my unreadiness for the world and the cruelty within it.

Much has been writ about the pain of growing old, but maybe the real nightmare is suffering through youth. The insecurity is something I don't miss. Though I felt eerily vulnerable just now, waking up and concerning myself for the first time in a long time, about whether I'd always be *alone.* Not usually a problem for me.

One thing is certain to me now. The human lifespan is very, very long, with plenty of time to feel the aches of everything and everyone slipping away.

...Or at least that's how I felt this morning, but that's not where I'll end this, because there is light and hope in this world as well, presently in the form of a piping hot cup of coffee and a new laptop with all sorts of tools for creative expression. In fact I feel pretty great at the moment! I just ate a big bowl of homemade wok with crispy pork belly and I'm about to go have a crack at some code shortly.

Life is good when you've been awake for a few hours and have the whole world at your fingertips.

1p0kukw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p0kukw/i_broke_a_rule_of_the_midnight_game_we_all_paid/,I broke a rule of the midnight game. We all paid for it.,"I didn’t believe in rituals. I’d grown up with horror movies and sleepover dares and a healthy skepticism that made me roll my eyes at most things marketed as “ancient.” The Midnight Game sounded like the same tired recipe: rules, theatrics, a high chance of embarrassment. 

It was late, I was alone, and I wanted to prove something to myself—that I could stare at nonsense and not be scared. That’s how arrogance starts. That’s how mistakes are made.

I read the rules twice before I started, and then I read them again because they read like someone who expected you to die if you skimmed. 

Cover every reflective surface. 

No electronics. 

New candles only, and matches—only matches, no lighters. 

A wooden front door. Salt you can pour. 

Three thirty-three a.m. is the finish line. 

Don’t open the refrigerator. 

Don’t fall asleep. 

Don’t stand still. 

Don’t use someone else’s blood. 

If the candle goes out, you’ve got ten seconds to relight it, and if you fail, you pour a circle of salt around yourself while turning—you don’t set the circle and step into it. 

Everything was very specific and quietly terrifying in a way that made me take the checklist seriously for the first time in my life.

I did most of it right. I covered the bathroom mirror and the tiny hallway portrait with towels. I closed the curtains and pushed shiny bowls into the back of the pantry. I set out a sandwich and an apple on a paper plate so I wouldn’t have to open anything mid-game. 

My front door was wood—old, warbled, the kind of door that creaks in the wind—and I slid the paper with my full name behind it like the rules said. I pricked my finger with the tiny sterilized pin, wiped the red drop on the paper with a concentrated kind of ceremony that felt absurd and intimate, then held the match in a hand that was suddenly not steady.

Everything felt theatrical until the last knock. Twenty-two, counted out like a joke that suddenly wasn’t funny. The final rap landed exactly as the minute changed, and I was absurdly proud of myself for being precise, for not hesitating. 

I opened the door, blew the candle out the way the instructions said, closed the door, and relit the candle to “officially” start the game. The wick smoked a little like the breath of something waking. It smelled faintly of vanilla and something older underneath it, like dark wood.

I’d told myself I wasn’t going to keep checking the clock; the rules said nothing about looking at time in that phrasing, but the list was long and the notion of not tracking time felt like part of the dare. Still, it’s human to measure things. 

I paced. I walked. I kept the candle up, stubbornly moving from room to room, deciding not to stand in a place long enough to be comfortable. For the first hour it felt like a novelty. 

The house sounded the way it always did at midnight—the pipes, the heater, the settling of wood—except every small noise made my throat tighten like cold air was in my chest.

At 12:05 the candle went out.

It didn’t sputter. It just vanished. The matchbox I had leaned against the sugar jar was on the counter beside me, and my hand went to it before my brain remembered anything about rules and matches and how the book had been adamant about not using a lighter. I couldn’t find the matches. 

Panicked, I dug into the drawer and found one open pack but the striker was worn down and the matches barely sparked. 

For whatever reason—sleep, adrenaline, thoughtlessness—I reached for the small butane lighter buried beneath a stack of receipts. It was instant: a quick puff of blue, a flash, and the flame was in my hand. I relit the candle, and the room relaxed like a held breath released.

That was the rule I broke.

The rules had said matches only. They had said do not use any other light source in place of a candle. It wasn’t dramatic in the moment. It barely registered as a moral failing. 

It was a tiny pragmatic decision to get a candle back in the wick before ten seconds were up. But ritual rules don’t care about pragmatism. They care about form. They care about obedience. In my case, they wanted an offering performed the way it was written.

The rest of the night went sideways. The candle light was thinner, somehow—a thread of yellow stretched over a dark I hadn’t seen before. The hallway at the edge of my vision hummed with a presence that made the hairs under my collar stand up like a row of tiny soldiers. 

Footsteps walked in the other room, bare and slow, and something leaned close enough to feel like a person’s breath across the back of my neck. I moved like the rules told me to: keep walking, don’t panic, don’t run. The ten-second rule didn’t give me time to think. That lighter in my hand felt like a bargain I’d made without reading the fine print.

When 3:33 rolled around, if I’d hoped for reprieve, it was only a merciful absence—the pressure eased, the footsteps faltered, and the house felt momentarily mine again. 

I didn’t sleep that morning; I sat on the couch watching dawn like it was an arrival party. I told myself it didn’t mean anything. That I’d been dramatic. That superstition is a clever thing that feeds on your nerves and then tells you you were right all along.

By noon my hands were still shaking. I called Marcus because he’s never less than twenty minutes away with rational explanations and a ridiculous supply of confidence. 

He listened, skeptical but curious. Tom texted in a few minutes and said he was in if Marcus was. They were there by eight, two sober men with their own brand of bravado: Marcus with lists, Tom with comic relief that covers the places he doesn’t want to think about.

They stepped into my house and the air changed. You don’t notice a place going wrong so much as you feel it like a bruise—where everything is the same but deeper. 

Marcus stopped in the doorway and looked around with a journalist’s instinct, cataloguing offhand: towels over mirrors, curtains closed, the sandwich still slightly dewy on the plate. 

Tom walked the perimeter like he was checking for traps, making a joke about “home renovation chic,” but neither of them laughed properly. Marcus asked, carefully, if I’d used a lighter when the candle went out. I told him it had been a matchbox and that I’d found another pack and struck them, fingers fumbling the story as if smoothing fabric.

They decided to stay. Not because I’d convinced them, but because both of them had always been the kind to refuse to leave a friend alone when something felt off with them. The real kind of friends.

We fortified ourselves with coffee and tried to keep the joke going, played loud music, tried to anchor daylight. We turned our phones off as the rules suggested—again, for solidarity, not because we believed the specifics—and sat waiting as midnight edged closer.

At 12:00 we did a mock check: a cautious laugh, a poke at the antique clock in the hallway, a ridiculous pact that we would get through it. I kept a candle in my hand simply because the rules demanded motion, and because the little bit of wax at the base felt like a charm. 

At 12:05 the candle we’d lit together burst into flame on its own wick. Not a match, not a spark—like a muscle contracting without a brain. The flame bent, reached, and leaned toward the hallway as if being inhaled by something waiting there.

The house cooled so fast Marcus’s breath fogged. The three of us moved as one at first: keep moving, don’t stop. The footsteps started from the hall and multiplied, coming from corners that made no sense. They weren’t clumsy or careless. They were precise and curious and very much aware of our presence. 

We huddled, ridiculous and real. Tom’s hand found my shoulder without either of us choosing it. Marcus laughed once, a thin, incredulous sound, then began to whisper questions like a litany to keep his mind occupied—did we check the oven? Did we turn off the breaker? Did we cover the mirrors properly?

That’s when the lights in the kitchen buzzed and died, not just turned off but extinguished as if light itself had been shoved into a pocket. Our phones when we tried them showed static at first and then blank blackness. 

The matches in the pack I’d told Marcus I’d used earlier were all gone when he checked, swallowed like they’d never existed. In the darkness the candle bent away from the window and toward the shadowed hallway. The smell in the room changed—not rotten, not floral, something older that made each breath taste like pennies.

We didn’t see the Midnight Man. We never saw a face. We felt him like weather. Something brushed past Tom’s cheek with cold and wet fingers; he reeled and fell back into the sofa with a yell that turned into exasperated breaths. 

Marcus grabbed at air and staggered, swearing he felt teeth against his palm. I felt a pressure on my left shoulder, a cold handprint that blossomed beneath the skin into a rose of bruises, tendriled and impossibly precise.

The rules had warned about being touched; they’d said touch meant interest and interest meant escalation. We should have been prepared. We should have known what to do.

We did nothing perfectly.

Tom tried to stand and run—the rule against running was the one that felt the stupidest at the moment, a meaningless detail in the face of panic—and a force collapsed around his knees so hard he fell into the rug. 

Marcus, a man who always keeps lists, fumbled his pocket for something metallic, a necklace he never takes off. The book had said metal could be protective, but it also warned that carrying weapons was a terrible idea because you’d do something foolish with them. 

Marcus clutched his chain and a cut burned into the back of his hand as if something had dragged a blade without leaving a nick.

When the candle went out, which it did because rules are a dangerous joke to try to bend, the darkness wasn’t a lack of light. It was a thing that swallowed the space. We had ten seconds—the instruction said ten—and I felt those seconds as a rubber band snapping taut between the three of us. 

Panic made time slow or speed up; I couldn’t tell. I fumbled for the match pack, found one and struck it, but the flame was dim and cold. Tom, in a structure of instinct I’ll replay in my head forever, grabbed for salt. 

He’d raked it into a shaky perimeter with a coffee mug as we’d been told: pour, don’t set the line and step in. He poured and turned, but he whispered for me to give him an object to keep the circle contiguous. I handed him the candle because it was the only thing I could find and the one move felt like reason.

We were sloppy with the salt. We were slow. The Midnight Game is a ceremony for people who can hold their hands steady when everything in a room is trying to make them drop their matches. 

When the thing reached for the circle, it didn’t break skin or drag us into shadow. It did worse: it traced along the saltline without crossing it, like a predator tasting glass, and the sound it made wasn’t noise—it was a terrible, wet whisper that sounded like my mother’s voice folded into my own. 

Marcus’s eyes rolled back. His mouth foamed with red. Tom screamed and screamed in a voice that slowly died and started to sound like an animal more than a man. 

When it stopped, we were all shaking, all bleeding from tiny cuts that had not been there before, the salt dusted like snow across our shoes.

In the morning, with sunlight doing work the rules said it always does, we catalogued ourselves. Tom’s arms were lined with small, red grooves like something had traced along them with a wire. 

Marcus’s knuckles had turned a bruised black and purple in patterns that made my stomach drop; his left thumb had a crescent impression sunk into it as if somebody had pressed a ring too hard. My shoulder had that handprint, a perfect, ink-dark bruise with thin, long fingers. We had no pride, only the sensation of being used and left with the souvenir.

We tried to be reasonable. Marcus argued for the locksmith, for tape on the windows, for someone to come stay the night in shifts. Tom wanted to talk about leaving the house entirely, about selling it, about moving across the country. I wanted someone to say this was over and be believed, to have a man with a clipboard note my symptoms and tell me it was a mass hysteria event. 

But the marks didn’t fit any reasonable pattern. We had scars that looked ceremonial, not accidental. The pattern on my shoulder wasn’t random bruising. It was a hand with fingers like ribs, a spiral in the palm that seemed to dip deeper with every sunset.

Marcus stopped sleeping. Tom stopped answering texts most days. The three of us agreed to never speak of who had used the lighter. That omission became a fossil between us—something we all knew but could not touch without breaking. 

We played at normalcy and failed, because the house doesn’t care if you fix the lawn or repaint the trim. When the candlelight skittered on the mantle at 12:05 like breath finding a match, the house would remember.

Two months later, Marcus shows up at my door at three in the morning with a bag packed. He stood on the porch and tells me in a voice that’s gone brittle, “You have to destroy the paper.” In the book, burning the blooded name at 3:33 is how you end it, how you declare you are free. 

The paper had been behind the door. I’d burned it once, or so I thought, with the tiny wax-split matches that survived. Marcus insisted the marks had spread because I hadn’t burned it correctly. Tom called me from last place he’d slept and said he kept hearing feet pacing the hallway at night like someone waiting for a turn.

We tried to do it the way the rules said. We tried to be exact and humble and ceremonial. We gathered matches we’d never used and set the name on a saucer and held a candle above it while the house leaned in. 

The flame licked the paper and for a second there was an exhale like a voice leaving a room. Then the candle went out. The paper didn’t burn all the way. It blackened at the edges and curled like a moth wing. Tom’s hand shook so hard he spilled all the salt.

We failed again.

There’s a line in the rules that I only read properly the third time I opened the book with my knees knocking. 

It’s small and almost academic in phrasing, like a footnote left by a tired librarian: do not use a lighter. do not use someone else’s blood. do not step into salt. do not let the Midnight Man touch you. Under it, written in a different hand, someone had circled the last sentence and scrawled once acknowledged, it acknowledges back.

Acknowledged how? By thinking about it? By realizing you’d used the wrong flame? By whispering its name?

I don’t know. I only know that tonight, at 12:05, I woke up to the smell of pennies and old wood and the sound of slow, wet footsteps at the foot of my bed. Tom’s voice was a whisper in my ear like he was in the room; he’d hung up after the first ring and never answered again. 

Marcus’s messages come in at alarming hours: pictures of his hands, of spiraled bruises on his palms, notes that say it followed us and then nothing.

The lighter sits in my junk drawer where I left it. Sometimes I open the drawer because I’m stupid enough to believe that touching the thing will make me feel like I’m back in control. It never does. The flame never comes to my fingertips without consequence.

Three of us broke something. One of us used a lighter and let form be more important than instruction. One of us tried to protect the others. One of us called in the rational world and watched it fail to catch us. The Midnight Game is not about killing; it’s about bookkeeping. It records the ways you use light and how you hand over your name. We handed ours over.

The bruise on my shoulder has grown into a spiral that looks, at certain angles, like a mouth. When I shower I can feel the ridge of it under my palm, like a secret embedded in flesh. Marcus refuses to come inside and sends photographs that make me sick. Tom stopped sleeping in his own house and now answers at two in the morning with a voice like glass and says, “It sat in the kitchen all day. It watched me cook and then it watched me eat.”

I don’t know how to fix this. There may be nowhere to fix it. The rules are simple enough to copy, and they are mean enough that they expect to be followed exactly. They are brutal in their grace: the smallest deviation is the one that matters. The lighter was a tiny convenience and it became a contract I didn’t read.

If you find this and you feel clever and skeptical and tempted to test the edges of superstition, do not use a lighter. Do not take shortcuts. Follow the list like your life’s in the margins—because maybe that’s exactly what it is.

We learned our lesson too late. We learned it with bruises that bloom like ink and voices that fold into our sleep. Tonight, the hallway light hums even when it’s off, and sometimes I wake up to the feeling of something standing at the foot of my bed and breathing out the incandescent smell of matches.

If you play the Midnight Game at all, play with matches. If you don’t have matches, don’t play. If you play and the candle goes out, pour your salt correctly. If you fail any of that, don’t expect to be offered mercy.

And if you see a handprint forming on your skin like a shadow is taking shape, don’t call Marcus or Tom. Don’t let them see it. They won’t be the same afterward. Neither of us are.

We keep telling ourselves to leave. One of us left. One of us kept coming back. One of us called at three in the morning and said only, “It remembers my name.”

Sometimes I whisper it back because acknowledgment seems worse than silence. Sometimes I think that’s exactly how it wants it.
If you can, learn from our idiocy. If you can’t, may whatever you think protects you be better than our matches were.",4,1763492946.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

1p0kn8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/hack_mag/comments/1p0kn8f/reverse_shell_of_237_bytes_how_to_reduce_the/,Reverse shell of 237 bytes. How to reduce the executable file using Linux hacks,"Once I was asked: is it possible to write a reverse shell some 200 bytes in size? This shell should perform the following functions: change its name and PID on a regular basis, make you coffee, and hack the Pentagon… Too bad, this is most likely impossible. But the task seemed interesting and challenging to me. Let’s see whether it can be implemented.

# What for?

Plenty of small reverse shells are available on the Internet: tiny shell, prism, and others. Reverse shells written in C are only tens to hundreds of kilobytes in size. So, what’s the point to create another one?

The point is simple. This is an educational article: similar to the development of kernel rootkits, which is one of the most intuitive ways to understand the structure of the Linux kernel, writing a reverse shell with additional functionality and restrictions on the executable file size enables you to explore some unexpected Linux features, including those related to ELF files, their loading and execution, resource inheritance in child processes, and linker operations. Along the way, plenty of exciting discoveries and curious hacks await you. And in the end, you will get a bonus: an operational tool that you can additionally refine, polish, and use in pentesting. Let’s start!

***WARNING: All information provided in this article is intended for educational purposes only. Neither the author nor the Editorial Board can be held liable for any damages caused by improper usage of this publication.***

# Terms of reference

In addition to the connection to a given port on a given host, your reverse shell must support the following functions:

* set its name at startup (to be less detectable);
* change the process identifier on a regular basis (to be more elusive); and 
* be as small as possible (to make your task more interesting).

First, you have to select the language. Since one of your main goals is to reduce the binary size, two options come to mind: C and assembly. Indeed, C makes it possible to create tiny (by modern standards) Hello Worlds (some 17 and \~800 KB for dynamic and static linking, respectively, vs. 2 MB in Go); however, as you probably know, when you compile C code, additional code is generated. This code is responsible for:

* execution of global constructors and destructors, if any;
* correct passing of arguments to `main()`; and 
* transferring control from `__libc_start_main()` to `main()`.

# Constructors and destructors

Arrays of constructor functions and destructor functions are called before and after `main()`, respectively. Their code is stored in separate sections – unlike the ‘normal’ code stored in `.text`. Such functions are used inter alia for various initializations in shared libraries or to set buffering parameters in apps interacting over the network (e.g. in CTF tasks). To ensure that a function falls into one of these sections, you must specify `__attribute__ ((constructor))` or `__attribute__ ((destructor))` prior to defining the function.

In some cases, the sections storing these functions can be named `.ctors`/`.init`/`.init_array` and `.dtors`/`.fini`/`.fini_array`. Generally speaking, all of them perform the same function, and their differences are irrelevant for the purposes of this article. More information on global constructors and destructors can be found on wiki.osdev.org.

Also, the output executable file may contain sections with debugging and other information (e.g. symbol names, compiler version, etc.); this information isn’t directly required for its execution and operation, but it increases the file size, sometimes significantly. Such sections will be discussed in more detail a little later.

This ‘harness’ is inextricably linked with C binaries (at least in Linux). But for your purposes, this is just ballast to be mercilessly disposed of. Therefore, your reverse shell should be written in the great and terrible assembly language (of course, for x86). The plan is as follows: first, you write operational code and then you start reducing its size.

# Coding

I suggest to use NASM. You can take the simplest asm reverse shell as a basis. In my humble opinion, 32-bit code is more preferable: instructions in this mode are shorter, and you don’t lose the required functionality since your primary objective is to connect to the server and run the shell; then the shell will operate in the 64-bit mode.

The code must perform the following operations:

* at startup, the reverse shell changes its first execution argument (these arguments are displayed in `ps`, and `htop`);
* it also changes the short name (it’s displayed by the `top` utility);
* then it tries to connect to the server. If the attempt fails, a child process is created, the parent one terminates, the timeout is waited, and the connection attempt is repeated; and 
* on successful connection, the shell runs `/bin/sh` whose `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` are linked with the socket communicating with the server. The process name is spoofed as well.

# So, what then is my name to you?

In Linux, there are two ‘entities’ that store the name associated with a process. Let’s call them ‘full’ and ‘short’ names. Both can be accessed via `/proc`: the full one is in `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`; while the short one, in `/proc/<pid>/comm` (comm for command).

According to its description, the short name contains the name of the executable file without the path to it. This name is stored in the kernel structure task\_struct describing the process (in kernel terms, task), and its length is limited to 16 characters, including the null byte.

The full name contains the program arguments (i.e. \*argv\[\]): the name of the executable file as it was specified at startup is stored in the zeroth element while the passed arguments (if any), in the rest of the elements.

It’s pretty easy to change the short name. You can use the prctl() system call for this purpose. With prctl(), a process or thread can perform various operations with its name, privileges (capabilities), memory areas, seccomp mode, etc. The number of the required operation is passed as the first argument followed by the rest of the parameters whose number can vary. You are interested in the operation PR\_SET\_NAME where the pointer to the new name is passed as the second argument. However, if the name, including the null byte, is longer than 16 characters, it will be truncated.

I’m so frustrated with this I know it’s a normal thing but why this is happening only once in a while ?

I managed to not let them know about it as my surgery was a secret it’s just within my parents and husband . How can I avoid this despite of taking small bites and chewing forever.

On 16/11/2025 I answered the questions in the 'UK ETA app' with 'No'.  It is said that the decision depends on various systems that the English government is connected to to monitor a person.

A minute later I received an email;
Dear....... ,
Your ETA application has been approved. You can now travel to the UK.
Your ETA is valid until: NOVEMBER 16, 2027.

I find this strange, apparently systems are not linked to check personal data.

Because I regularly went to London to party during the weekends in 2022 2023 2024 (before the ETA system)... I would now like to go again.

I have no idea if I can pass through border control at the airport. I think you have to scan the passport with facial recognition. 

I understand that the English government wants to keep 'bad apples' outside the border. It has been more than 15 years since I came into contact with the law.

The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

The 82nd went all-out to show their appreciation for you consistently generous support! A signed flag, t-shirt (size L), hip flask, coffee mug, two patches, small flag, and large wall clock make this one of the richest packs we have done in a very long time!

So, you have to turn it up to 9 or 10, and then even adjust the lower settings to open it up a bit more. This way, you can grind more coarse and fully experience what this grinder can do.

I got results for a magnetic stirring cup/mug instead, which I didn’t even know was a thing because I’m not a coffee drinker. There are several variations of this product, but the one I’m looking at has a small magnetic capsule that spins at the bottom of the thermos. Has anyone attempted to try the magnetic stirring cup to produce a glass bead effect? I don’t have any STEM background whatsoever lol. My questions are: 1) would the spinning capsule be strong enough for nails or is the height of the mug too tall ? 2) Could I replace the capsule with a mega strong magnet like 30lb U? 
Would love to know your thoughts! 

I asked Rufus (Amazon’s AI) what kind of magnet it is: “The Self Stirring Coffee Mug uses magnetic stir bars made from PP (polypropylene) material with a magnetic core inside. The product comes with 2 separate magnetic stir bars that are designed to be corrosion-resistant and tested for strong magnetic adsorption to the bottom of the cup.

The magnetic stirring mechanism works with a motor that spins at 6400 RPM, creating the powerful vortex effect that customers frequently mention. The magnetic bars are safely encased in the PP material to prevent corrosion and ensure they stay securely attached to the cup bottom during operation.”

I spent countless hours here searching for answers, comfort, and hope. So I wanted to give back to this forum.

We went through three miscarriages in two years, a 16 week loss, a chemical pregnancy, and a 12 week loss. We did all the testing and everything came back pretty normal for both of us.

Here’s what I believe helped us eventually get our rainbow baby:

⸻

What I Focused On:

I took about three months to really focus on myself and on us as a couple. During that time, I read a lot and tried to support my body and mind as best I could.

Supplements: COQ10 for both of us (egg and sperm quality), vitamin D, and a good prenatal.
Acupuncture: Helped prepare my body before trying again.
Nutrition: Ate more whole, nutritious foods and limited caffeine to one coffee a day.
Sleep Hygiene: Kept a consistent sleep routine and made sure my last meal was 2 to 3 hours before bed to support my circadian rhythm.

Cycle Awareness and Hormone Support

I followed Mindy Pelz’s guidance on understanding my monthly cycle, what to eat during each phase, and what types of exercise are best. For example, the week before my period I focused on lighter movement like walking and yoga.

This approach really helped me because it supported my body with the right foods at the right time to naturally maintain healthier levels of progesterone and estrogen. Her work isn’t specifically a pregnancy focused book, but it’s centered on women’s hormone cycles, which ended up being incredibly valuable. She also includes fasting protocols that I adapted and used in a gentle way to support fertility.


Supporting My Husband’s Role:

From my own research, I learned that it’s healthy for men to ejaculate every 3 to 5 days to keep sperm quality optimal, so we didn’t only focus on ovulation week. We kept a consistent rhythm instead of saving everything for ovulation, which helped ensure healthier sperm turnover.


Protecting My Mental Space:

I actively removed negativity from my daily life, less news, fewer violent or emotionally heavy shows, and it made a noticeable difference in how calm and grounded I felt.


What Ultimately Worked:

We did timed intercourse every other day around ovulation and a non medicated IUI cycle (mainly to use our insurance benefits in case IVF was next). One of those paths worked, we’re not sure which, but the fourth pregnancy finally stuck and we welcomed our rainbow baby this year.

My doctor had me on progesterone until 12 weeks and aspirin throughout because I was 38. Once I got the positive test, I didn’t travel the entire pregnancy and took the first trimester very easy, continuing to keep my environment as stress free as possible.

⸻

I hope this brings even a little bit of hope to those still in the thick of it. You’re not alone, and brighter days can come even when it feels impossible. Sending love to all of you.

It’s been way too many years away, too many Christmases without lechón, too many balaitos I haven’t eaten… It’s TIME.

  
**But**, of course, life said: “Oh, you want things to go smoothly? LMAO, hold my Medalla.”

I have **three dogs rescued by my mom**, who passed away from cancer **here in Ecuador**, and since then they basically became my **younger, furry siblings—dramatic, needy, and fully dependent on me**. Obviously, I’m not leaving them behind. They’re my family.

Everything was “sort of okay” until I found out that **entering the U.S. with dogs now is basically like applying to join the Illuminati**.  There’s the rabies test — which, apparently, is only done in like five labs on the entire planet (why? are my dogs radioactive?). Then the CDC permit — as if they’re undercover agents. Then quarantine, then forms written in what I’m convinced is an alien language…

**And just to make things worse**, each dog costs **$2000** to travel. Yes, **TWO THOUSAND. PER. DOG.** That’s **$6000 total**, not including my own expenses, my emotional breakdowns, or the industrial-strength coffee I’ll need to survive this process.

So here I am, alone, looking at my dogs like: “One of you needs to get a job… or should we hold a raffle for a *premium balaito*?”

The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song.

You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

Once I found Hoffmann's channel, I knew his recipes are what I wanted to aim for (they were at least the ""starting point"" that I could build off of). 

I started by taking down recipes for both brewers based on his videos (trying to use his most recent videos if he had newer ones), and I made recipes for both hot and iced in each brewer. 

In his [""ultimate"" Aeropress technique video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6VlT_jUVPc) he very clearly says to use 11g if light roast to 200g water (or 55g per liter). He then recommends 60g or 65g per liter for dark roast (so I landed on 13g if I'm still using 200g water). 

In his [more recent ""better"" one cup V60 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oB1oDrDkHM&t=57s), he pretty much just says to use 15g coffee to 250g water. He says he's using a light roast, but doesn't talk about a difference in ratio between light and dark (he only mentions a difference in water temperature later in the video). 

If I use 250g water in his ""ultimate"" aeropress technique, his recommendations come out to 13.75g for light and 16.25g for dark. But why the difference? 

I guess the ratios are all kind of in the ballpark of each other, but I'm just wondering if anyone has any thoughts on why he stresses the difference in ratio for light and dark for his Aeropress technique but not for the V60... Maybe his opinion changed between those videos, maybe he doesn't think the coffee ratio matters as much in a V60 as it does in an Aeropress, etc.? 

I'm trying not to stress it too much, but still curious if anyone has any thoughts.",2,1763491692.0,JamesHoffmann,3,1.0,False

because my brain is doing a full am I overreacting? haul about it and I need other people to witness this. I’m not looking for advice. This weekend made me realize that a friendship I’ve invested in for a long time has quietly unraveled, and now that the final thread snapped, I’m seeing the whole pattern clearly. I(23) Female and she (21) Female:

For the sake of the story, I’ll call her “Jenna” or “Jen” for short. 

We’ve been friends for a while, and for most of that time, I tried really hard to make the friendship work. I’m someone who connects deeply; I don’t do surface-level relationships with people I care about. She, on the other hand, stays on this emotional surface I can’t reach her through. She expects emotional support from me — she unloads her problems in detail — but when I want to speak about something personal, she can’t hold the space. She either shuts down, changes the topic, or just… disappears from the conversation. Over time it made me feel like what I say doesn’t matter as much as what she says. There were other patterns too. She talks badly about everyone. Everyone. And at one point I told her I didn’t want to do that anymore, that I’m trying to be more mindful about what energy I engage in. She genuinely couldn’t continue the conversation after that. It was like she couldn’t talk to me unless it was negative. That bothered me more than I admitted at the time. She also flakes. Constantly. She’ll get excited about a plan and confirm it, and then the day arrives and suddenly she’s tired, unavailable, or just disappears. But if she wanted something — especially emotional support — I was expected to show up. And I did, more times than I should have. Add all of that together and there’s this underlying feeling of being used, or at least not valued equally. But I kept pushing that aside.

Then came this weekend.

Saturday – the photoshoot

We planned a little photoshoot together — her idea. She even said she’d pay me. I didn’t care about the money, and I made a small joke about charging “300 rand.” Obviously a joke. But her reaction wasn’t light or playful. She looked almost thrown off, like the idea of paying me was suddenly distasteful. It was the first moment that day where I felt something shift. The whole shoot felt tense. Not dramatic, just… strained. Like she was slightly annoyed by me but pretending not to be. Afterwards, we grabbed food and went up to my apartment to eat. She’s mocked me playfully about it before — “Do you hear that guy shouting?” and I’d be like, “Yes,” and she’d say, “I don’t hear anything.” It was harmless but annoying. Me and Jen were having a conversation about random stuff and later I realised that she has grown quiet and I asked her twice to say something but she just mumbled something quiet. And I really opened up to her about my cousins passing and she just stared at me but then she started tapping her bottle. Repeatedly. Loudly. In this rhythmic way that gets under your skin after a while. And I asked her nicely to stop. She didn’t. It’s like she enjoyed seeing my discomfort. I asked again. Nothing. I asked a third time and yet again nothing. I started saying that I would get nasty and I don’t want to be nasty, nothing, and only then did I put my foot down: “Okay, that’s enough.” And the way she looked at me… like I was being unreasonable, like she was mad? Pure silence but from both of us, at that moment I didn’t want to say something else and Jen also kept quiet. So I walked her back down to her car and I collected something said thanks and drive safe. And in that moment, I suddenly felt the imbalance of the friendship. If she asked me to stop doing something that bothered her, I would stop immediately. The fact that my boundary didn’t matter to her — not even a simple request — hit me harder than the tapping itself. It wasn’t about the bottle.
It was about everything that led up to the bottle.

Tuesday – the avoidance

Tuesday morning she ignored me in person. Not subtle. Actual ignoring. No eye contact. No acknowledgement. Just… nothing. But then later, over WhatsApp, suddenly she’s talkative. Which is so like her — in-person tension is too uncomfortable for her, so she opts for the easy, distant option where emotions don’t have to be confronted. It felt cowardly, honestly. I confronted her and asked her if I can collect my stuff and she aaid she’ll come drop it off and I left it at that. Then later I messaged her and asked if I can collect it today and she said “yes, I’ll be available after 17:00”  because if she’s coming over to drop it off then that means that she probably will use it as an excuse to come in because she’s also using me and my apartment to get away from her parents (she has admitted to this). So I messaged back saying I’ll let her know when I’m on my way, and then she messaged actually I’m with my parents how does 11am work tomorrow. So great we’re sticking to that for now. It feels like she wants the friendship to “reset” without ever acknowledging that something is wrong. 
Then came another message, and this one said a lot without her realizing it: She wrote in this warm, slightly-too-soft tone — the kind she uses when she’s trying to smooth things over without naming the actual problem. But that’s the thing.
She wasn’t trying to talk things out.
She wasn’t trying to acknowledge the tension.
She wasn’t taking accountability for anything that happened this weekend — or for months leading up to it. She was trying to skip straight to “We’re fine” without having the uncomfortable conversation that would actually make anything fine. The tone of her messages felt like someone placing a blanket over a fire instead of putting it out — hoping it just stops burning on its own. It felt like a soft attempt at reconnection that didn’t actually reconnect anything. And the strangest part is:
her messages made me feel even more sure that the friendship is done.
Because it showed me how incapable she is of sitting with emotional reality.

The unfollowing
Not long after the messages, I noticed she’d removed me from her personal account and deleted my number on WhatsApp. 
Not blocked — just removed.
But she kept me on her business account. So I unfollowed both and deleted her too.
Not out of pettiness — out of alignment. I don’t want to support someone who doesn’t extend me basic respect.

Where I am now

I feel peaceful, genuinely. Lighter. But also a little sad. Not devastated — just thoughtful. I cared more than she did, and I accepted less than I should have. That’s always a painful thing to confront. But I’m also proud of myself for recognizing the imbalance instead of continuing to push through it out of habit or hope. I’m done chasing reciprocity from someone who isn’t capable of giving it.
Done confiding in someone who can’t meet me emotionally.
Done being the stable presence for someone who can’t return even the simplest version of the same. It’s over. And it needed to be. Putting it here makes it real. And strangely, that makes it easier to let go.

My husband and I are expecting our first at the end of April. We’ve looked at strollers and have decided on the Cybex EOS Lux, but we haven’t yet confirmed the compatible infant car seats would fit in our vehicle. However, we’re also looking at convertible car seats and trying to weigh the pros and cons for our specific situation. 

- I will be taking the full year off with baby. 
- I do not drive. My husband will have the car with him most days for work. 
- We live in an extremely walkable area (restaurants, grocery stores, coffee shops, etc) so walking around with baby will be easy and will happen daily (for me on mat leave)
- Baby will only be using car seat if we are going somewhere far (parents house, out for lunch/etc)
- We hope to baby wear for lots of outings away from home. 

I know that having a compatible car seat with stroller is a huge bonus during the newborn/infant stage, but cutting the cost of buying two car seats would be great, and me being able to walk around with baby and having access to almost all essentials is making me think maybe we don’t NEED the compatible seat. 

I’m looking for opinions from others on if they chose the convertible seat over the infant, if they regretted it or not, or any advice for a FTM!

Thanks!

It’s been ok but one person in particular that I was very hesitant about was a girl that I was crazy for right before my baptism. I remember crying becuase I didn’t want to get baptize but thought it help my mother. For context, I converted at 21 at a low point in my life. Now 36. Younger sister DAd 5 years ago and I still live with my mother. Anyways I remember as the years went by I saw that she got married and well you guys can guess how I felt. Fast forward more years and now that I’m trying to look for outside friends, I came to the information that she got divorced years ago. Another friend I reconnected with told me. I worked up the courage to contact her. And she immediately contacted me back. She said how she always thought about me a few days ago. And she even said that the guy she married turned out to be a cheater and always wondered what happened to me. I was very happy to hear she still thought about me but heart broken becuase of what she went through. Almost felt like had I just worked the courage to be with her, maybe things would be different. Who knows? Anyways here I’m thinking since it’s been years since her divorce maybe I can finally start off and attempt what I could t do. Then she says “also I just got engaged 2 weeks ago!!” Aaaaaaaannnd my heart sank lmao 😂. But you know what? She still wants to go out and drink coffee to catch up. This time however, I won’t ghost her. I want to tell her I’m sorry and the real reason I stopped communicating was because of this religion and the guilt and that it had nothing to do with her. It was my decision and fault. The only thing I’m gonna have to try and NOT do is tell her how I felt before and still kinda do. Ironically, her saying that and me meeting up with her is causing extreme anxiety becuase it’s like a voice in my head is saying “the enemy is trying to me make you sin. Why would you meet up with her? You know this is wrong to do?” But I’m tired….tired of the guilt and shame…tired of cutting people off cause they are a “bad” influence. Idk what’s going to happen this Friday meeting up with her, but I do know I don’t want to run away anymore from things. I don’t want to take this as a sign that I should just stay a jw because that’s all that’s left. I’m scared…I truly am.

Full breakdown,"I’ve seen [PowerPoint.guru](https://powerpoint.guru/?rt=3s5N90wp) mentioned a few times and always wondered if it was actually a legit presentation design service or just another site selling generic templates.

  
I finally tried it last week for a 15-slide academic/business-style presentation and wanted to share a full, transparent review — what worked, what didn’t, and whether I’d use them again.

1. Ordering Process (surprisingly smooth)

Their order form is simple — you upload your draft, notes, or even a messy Google Doc. I literally dropped a half-finished outline + some screenshots. No special instructions.

They asked a few clarifying questions about:

* tone (academic/professional/creative)
* color palette
* whether I wanted icons, charts, or animations
* level of redesign (light / full rework)

It felt more “human designer” than automated.

2. Communication (quick & not robotic)

I expected generic support replies, but I actually got messages that referred to my content specifically.  
Like:

>

Responses came within 1–2 hours.

3. Turnaround Time

I chose their standard option.  
Got the first draft in about 24 hours, which was faster than I expected for a full redesign.

Revisions took 4–5 hours.

If you need a same-day deck, I’d say it’s doable.

4. Quality of the Slides (the big one)

Honestly? Better than what I could’ve done even with three cups of coffee and Canva Pro.

Highlights:

* super clean layout
* consistent style across all slides
* charts looked cohesive
* typography wasn’t random (hallelujah)
* no cheesy clipart
* visuals were aligned, spaced properly, and balanced
* they converted my long paragraphs into punchy bullet points

My favorite part — they rebuilt one of my ugliest slides into a neat infographic.  
I didn’t even ask for that.

5. Revisions

They allow revisions, and they handled mine without pushback.

I requested:

* less bright colors
* timeline moved earlier in the deck
* one extra visual for the conclusion

All were applied exactly as I asked.

6. Pricing

It’s not “cheap student freelancing” prices, but also not overpriced.  
You’re basically paying for someone who knows PowerPoint well — structure, visuals, storytelling. For the quality I got, I’d say the pricing is fair.

7. What I didn’t love (to stay honest)

* No real-time chat (all communication was messaging, though fast).
* The animations were good, but a bit more subtlety would be nice — I toned them down.
* Export options were standard (PPTX + PDF). Could be great to have a Google Slides export.

None of this ruined the experience, just small wishes.

If you need a polished, professional deck — whether it’s academic, business, or a job presentation — [**PowerPoint.guru**](https://powerpoint.guru/?rt=3s5N90wp) actually delivers.  
It’s not a template marketplace. There’s a real design process and real designers behind it.

Would I use it again? Yes — especially for big class presentations, pitch decks, or anything where visuals matter.",1,1763491480.0,LateNight_School,0,1.0,False

I feel like my mind is going 100mph right now, I can’t stop overthinking all the questions and what they meant and my responses. This was the first part of the assessment and it was largely activity based and over zoom. I’m wondering if anyone with more knowledge can shed some light on what the purpose of these exercises were? I mostly just left feeling confused and kind of like a failed some kind of test lol 

For the first activity the assessor asked me to find five objects close to me and make up a story with them and I had a complete blank, I put my daughters hairbrush on a coaster and said it could be a boat but other than that I had absolutely no idea what to do with my other items (a fidget spinner, a controller and a plant). I tried so hard to create some kind of narrative but my mind was totally blank. Eventually after me staring blankly at my items, apologising profusely and saying ‘I just can’t think of anything’ fifteen million times, she said don’t worry we can drop this task and move on to a different one. 

For the second one, as I had already mentioned that I like to make my coffee a certain way so I don’t like other people making me one, she said imagine that she came to my house and said she could make me a coffee if I tell her how to, what would that look like. So I just talked her though how I make my coffee, what syrup I use, what spoon I use, that I use an aeropress and how that works, and the order that I do things in. I really am confused about what this one means lol

The third one was a storybook with no words. She started telling the narrative of a boy who had fallen asleep reading a book and asked me to carry on. Again I drew a total blank on this. The book was completely whack and I had no idea what was going on 😂 so I kind of just described what I could see on each page. On one page they were riding pigs so I said ‘the boy is riding a pig instead of a horse’ and she asked me what I thought the phrase ‘when pigs fly’ meant, so I said that pigs don’t usually fly so when something unbelievable happens it’s like a pig flying. I asked a few times if I was doing the book one wrong and she said it didn’t matter, it could be however I interpreted it. I couldn’t think of a narrative because like I said the book was crazy so I just described all the stuff going on. 

The last one was a picture. She asked me what I could see and I said ‘an island’, she said if I’d want to go there and I said no because it’s really busy. Then she asked if I’ve ever been on holiday and I said yes but not really as an adult because I don’t like flying so we just do road trips to caravan parks in the uk. Then she asked if I could go anywhere in the world by any mode of transport where would I go, so I said my choice of transport would be the car and I’d just go to somewhere nice and remote with good views and walks. Then she asked me what I do when I get to a caravan and I said unpack, figure out where stuff is and plan the days. 

Then the last part confused me quite a lot, I feel like it was a test but I have no idea. She said ‘I have some places I’d like to go’ and I waited for her to elaborate but she didn’t, so after an awkward silence I asked her where and she briefly said where, then again she said ‘I have another place I’d like to go’ and again, awkward silence where I thought she’d speak before I asked where. I don’t know what this was, it felt like she was purposefully making things awkward because she was very chatty for the rest of it. Was that a test of some kind?! 

I know I’m overthinking this but I’d love some clarity on what all this actually means and what the purpose of these activities are. If anyone has any information please let me know! Thanks ",0,1763491440.0,AutismTranslated,5,0.5,False

I’m willing to arrange a meetup if you’re nearby, my aunt and I would love to have a chat with you and buy you a coffee for your generosity!

Feel free to PM me for details or mailing info. (Creeps stay away or you WILL be reported, i cannot stress this enough)

Thank you so much for helping support women who often go without proper bras. Every donation truly makes a difference 💕",1,1763491158.0,braswap,4,1.0,False

I tried a ton of stuff, bought way too much, and had some really great conversations with founders.

*Here's the complete breakdown of what stood out:*

**SUPPLEMENTS & NUTRITION**

[**London Nootropics**](https://londonnootropics.com/) \- I'm just a sucker for a good mushroom coffee and the flavor of these were great. They blend functional mushrooms like Lion's Mane and Cordyceps with instant coffee. If you've been let down by the usual earthy/bitter taste of mushroom coffees, give these a shot. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**V14**](https://v14.com/) \- I liked the flavor and ingredients on this product a lot. It's a longevity-focused supplement blend. Reminds me of Novos Labs Core a bit in how they approach formulation. I liked the flavor but my friend didn't so depends on your taste. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

[**Kosterina**](https://www.kosterina.com/) \- I did a shot of this high polyphenol olive oil every day. Great tasting and love the shot form factor - makes it easy to be consistent with getting quality polyphenols in. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

[**Tonum**](https://tonum.com/) \- Learned about this product from Sean Wells who is doing lots of interesting things within the di-peptide space (GLP-1 alts etc). I think the formulations are pretty interesting and I like that they do research as well, not just slapping together trendy ingredients. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**Timeline**](https://www.timelinenutrition.com/) \- I really like how Urolithin A makes me feel. Really helps my energy levels. This is one of the few longevity supplements where I actually notice consistent effects. Already a long time user. (✅ *Purchased*)

[**TMW Longevity**](https://tmwlongevity.com/) \- Smaller brand with a liposomal supplement heavy on functional mushrooms. I thought the formulation was kind of cool. Founder was very nice and worth trying out. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**Pendulum**](https://pendulumlife.com/) \- I've used them before, didn't feel a huge difference but I think the science is sound and I like their founder a lot, Colleen. They're doing interesting work with specific bacterial strains that aren't in most probiotics like Akermansia. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**EnergyBites**](https://energybites.com/) \- Had samples of their spirulina and chlorella. It's hard to find well sourced and tested algae so liked that they did lots of testing for contaminants. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**Jumpsport Liquid Hydrogen**](https://www.jumpsport.com/products/liquid-hydrogen-h2-electrolyte-zero-sugar-drink-mix) \- I tried their Molecular Hydrogen Electrolytes. Couldn't really tell the benefits but an interesting new product vertical. Hydrogen water is having a moment. (✖️ *Won't Purchase*)

[**Echo Water**](https://echowater.com/) \- Tried their hydrogen water system. Couldn't really tell the benefits but an interesting new device vertical worth watching. (✖️ *Won't Purchase*)

**PEPTIDES**

[**Protocole**](https://theprotocole.com/) \- I really like this founder and think they are the best option on the market for legally sourcing tested peptides (if you don't want to risk self sourcing from China). Quality testing and transparency on sourcing is huge in this space, but you pay for what you get. (⭐ *Highly Recommend*)

**FOOD & BEVERAGE**

[**Prima**](https://eatprima.com/) \- Love these protein bars. Great between sessions. Clean ingredients and macros, actually tastes good. Interestingly David was also there, but wasn't a fan of their bar at all. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

[**Seatopia**](https://www.seatopia.com/) \- This is the only fish I'll ever buy again. Raised in open ocean pens with zero microplastics or heavy metals detected in their testing. If you care about seafood quality, this is the new standard. (⭐ *Highly Recommend*)

[**Wild Orchard Tea**](https://www.wildorchard.com/) \- Regenerative agriculture tea from the volcanic soil of Jeju Island in Korea. Was great. Love the sourcing story and the quality shows. Didn't get to try their Black Matcha, but very intrigued. (✅ *Purchased*)

[**Lineage Provisions**](https://lineageprovisions.com/) \- They had their beef jerky (air dried steak) samples at the convention and wow it was honestly so fucking good. If you're a meat eater definitely recommend this product. I went through like three bags. (✅ *Purchased*)

[**Big Bold Health**](https://bigboldhealth.com/) \- Bought some of the buckwheat. I actually got to sit in with a session with Dr. Jeffrey Bland, their founder, who was the sweetest. Very smart and a huge pioneer in functional medicine. (✅ *Purchased*)

**TESTING & DIAGNOSTICS**

[**MoldCo**](https://moldco.com/) \- I know the founder well and am a patient. Great for mold testing and recovery. If you're dealing with mold exposure or suspect it, this is the best resource I've found for comprehensive testing and actual recovery protocols. (⭐ *Highly Recommend*)

[**Lutanen Health**](https://lutanen.com) \-  This founder is one of my favorite people I met at the summit. Dr. Luthar is an incredibly knowledgable longevity focused doctor in Boston. Lutanen is a concierge clinic and basically exactly what I personally was looking for. More affordable than a lot of the other clinics and run by a doctor who is at the cutting edge of medicine. (⭐ *Highly Recommend*)

[**Generation Labs**](https://generationlab.com/) \- Doing great work in the biological age testing space. Definitely worth checking out if you're serious about tracking longevity metrics beyond just feeling good. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

[**OneSkin**](https://www.oneskin.co/) \- I did skin testing with OneSkin and got their serum to test. I like them a lot and the science is good - they're working with proprietary peptides. I don't always love their product textures though. (✅ *Purchased*)

[**Eli Health**](https://eli.health/) \- I got a sample pack to test my cortisol which I did today. Pretty cool product for at-home hormone testing but wish there were more insights out of the box beyond just giving you the numbers. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

[**Tiny Health**](https://www.tinyhealth.com/) \- Got a sample test to try out. Will report back. I'm a Jona user for microbiome testing, so curious how it's different. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

**DEVICES & TECHNOLOGY**

[**Nuropod**](https://nuropod.com/) \- Wow I tried a lot of cool devices and I had heard about this one back in the day from Bryan Johnson. He actually still uses this and I can tell why. I felt a huge effect in one session even. Almost valium level calm. It's a sensory deprivation float pod - if you're serious about stress management this is worth the investment. (⭐ *Highly Recommend*)

[**Absolute Rest**](https://www.absoluterest.com/) \- Very cool startup helping insomnia sufferers. Really loved their founder who I met briefly. Great team and mission. If you're dealing with sleep issues beyond basic sleep hygiene, check out what they're building. (⭐ *Highly Recommend*)

[**SaunaSpace**](https://saunaspace.com/) \- I briefly met the founder who was lovely and the products felt great when I quickly tried them out. They make near-infrared saunas. Would love to spend more time with them though - didn't get a full session. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**Molekule**](https://molekule.com/) \- I got to chat with some of the execs and they have some cool new products on the horizon. This was the first air purifier I bought and my parents still use theirs. Still holds up. (✅ *Purchased*)

[**OxyHealth**](https://oxyhealth.com/) \- I tried their HBOT chamber which was my first HBOT experience which is crazy considering how long I've been biohacking. Worked well and no issues with claustrophobia, my ears just hurt a bit after. Felt a bit blissed out the rest of the day which was nice. Definitely want to explore regular HBOT now. (✖️ *Won't Purchase*)

[**Shiftwave**](https://shiftwave.co/) \- I was very sad I didn't get to try Shiftwave which seemed awesome and I heard great things from the people that did try it. It's a PEMF device. (⚠️ *Missed*)

[**Ammortal Chamber**](https://ammortal.com/) \- I was 3 minutes late to my appointment and they canceled my appointment which was frustrating but my friend might be buying one for his clinic so will report back. It's a red light therapy + vibration + molecular hydrogen bed. The design looks super cool. (⚠️ *Missed*)

[**NanoVi**](https://eng3corp.com/) \- Tried the NanoVi and didn't really feel much. I also don't know if there is much research behind ""structured water"" so not really sure about this one. (✖️ *Won't Purchase*)

[**Aescape**](https://aescape.com/) \- Was overbooked so I couldn't get my robot massage. Bummed because this looked really interesting, but probably not a replacement for human massages anyway. (⚠️ *Missed*)

**SKINCARE & FRAGRANCE**

[**Auro Wellness**](https://aurowellness.com/) \- Made a topical Glutathione that really brightened my skin in a crazy way. I'm still trying to figure out why - the transdermal delivery of glutathione is interesting. Results were noticeable. (✔️ *Might Purchase*)

[**Young Goose**](https://younggoose.com/) \- I tried a face mist from Young Goose. Their formulations are pretty cool with some interesting peptide blends + senolytics, but also very expensive. Premium skincare for sure. (✖️ *Won't Purchase*)

[**Realm**](https://www.breatherealm.co/) \- Great healthy swap for fragrance sprays. Clean ingredients, no questionable chemicals. Simple but needed. I really liked their approach. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

**THERAPEUTICS**

[**Beond Ibogaine**](https://beondibogaine.com/) \- *Planning to Try* Beond Ibogaine was very present throughout the summit. Seems like a great team and a powerful therapeutic for addiction and mental health. It's still expensive for many people at $12k+ but I'm going to save up and try it out. If anyone has experience with their program, let me know. (✅ *Will Purchase*)

**PRODUCTS TO WATCH**

[**Myoform**](https://www.myoform.io/) \- Talked to this founder and very excited for this product to launch. Personalized supplements have always been promising but never done right IMO. These guys are approaching the problem in an interesting way and have their own factory to make the supplements, which gives them way more control over quality than white label operations. (✅ *Joined Waitlist*)

**Overall:**

Really enjoyed Eudemonia. The quality of founders and products was high, and the conversations were worth the trip alone. I'll share some of my favorite sessions/topics in another post.

**What I'm prioritizing from this:**

1. Nuropod for regular vagal nerve stimulation sessions
2. Protocole for clean peptides
3. Seatopia for all my fish
4. Getting more HBOT sessions in
5. Saving up for Beond Ibogaine

I'm new to the espresso game besides drinking it at cafes, but I'm really wanting to make my own iced coffees, chai lattes, and frappuccino's. However, I'm interested in seeing if I like to drink it straight as well.

Preferably nothing that takes up too much counter space - I live with my parents and my mom doesnt like appliances on the counter so if we can store it and move it easily is preferable.

I have no experience making espresso so something intuitive and beginner friendly without being a full blown barista set-up.

I have a slight preference towards manual machines, as I do enjoy the idea of the machines you see in coffee shops where you have to tamp the puck. I already have a milk frother/steamer so I really dont need a steamer/frother attachment. I like the idea of volumetrics as well. I dont want it to have an app. I've heard some negative things about how Nespresso and Keurig last and the upkeep so I would prefer to lean away from them.

1p0jy8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1p0jy8d/how_do_i_25m_set_up_an_intervention_for_my/,How do I (25M) set up an intervention for my partner (20F)’s lifestyle?,"I’m (25M) having a hard time connecting with my partner (20F).

I’ve been together with my partner for over a year now, and I see long term with her. I love her and the our hangouts and conversations.

Recently, I’ve been feeling this frustration for the choices that my partner has been making for her life. She’s currently in college and I can’t help but feel that theres not much going on in her life when this should be the time for her to be really living it up.   
Not even in the sense of partying or hanging out with friends, but really studying or chasing passions or dreams or making good use of all the free time she has..

My partner is not a morning person, she sleeps until around noon, where she goes to college around 12pm. If college starts at 4pm or class is cancelled, she’ll usually sleep until 1-2pm. Since she’s back from school either at 3pm (1class) or 6pm (2 classes) from school, I don’t think theres a lot of time that I’m missing out from her usual day. Some days, she’ll just register for attendance and sleep through her lectures at home.

After the afternoon is complete, she’s back home, and from what I can tell, stays in her room and watches youtube or some other social media scrolling. She never goes out by herself to hang out with friends, she doesn’t cook, doesn’t like games, doesn’t go shopping doesn’t have a part time job, and most of her optional leisure time is hanging out with me. 

When we do hang out, we have a lot of fun, most of the time the dynamic between us is that she tags along whatever I am doing. I do get tired of setting up all the plans sometimes but it’s not a big deal for me, as we always have fun at the end of the day.

The only other social outlet that she has is her three siblings, her best friend from high school that called for five awkward minutes, and a friend from high school that she tells me she doesn’t want to hang out with and keeps delaying the meeting.

It seems that her assignments are being completed, but she always uses ChatGPT, and I’m not sure how much effort she puts into the assignments. She has been applying to jobs apparently but not hearing back, but I rarely hear about her job applications. 

Just yesterday, after falling asleep at 1am, I was called in the middle of the night at 3am (though I don’t remember much about the beginning of the call) being held hostage in the call by my partner to the point that I had an emotional breakdown, because she had coffee at midnight and couldn’t sleep because of her fear of the dark(understandable, but I asked her to turn on the nightlight and she’s afraid it will explode), knowing fully well that I had just come back from a 12hour shift, and 3 more 12 hour shifts scheduled throughout the week. I have not slept since 3am today from the ruined sleep and I will most likely be up until midnight today prepping for the upcoming holiday. 

All of this to say, I don’t think this is normal behavior for a 20 year-old college student in the city. 
I was also a very introverted individual when I was 20, but I’ve always had my close group of friends to talk to and I’ve had my gaming hobbies back in college.
I wasn’t great in school (failing a couple classes), but I’ve always been a stickler for attendance in school and paying attention to class, or at least to show up (I’ve fallen asleep during lectures numerous occasions)

I’ve lived through the early parts of my life where I was irresponsible and negligent to growing, filling my life with not much of value for years, but for the past few years, I’ve been working to grow past that and know that filling my life with passion and goals and hobbies is what gives me happiness. I’ve come to try to embody the saying of “how you live today is how the rest of your life will look like”.

I’m genuinely worried sick for this girl as both my long term partner and a human. 
I want to confront how I’m feeling about this issue to her, to help her, in my opinion, and get her to feel motivated about life more.

I understand there are mental health issues at play here that need attention from a professional. 
Regardless of all that, we come from different cultures and obviously an age gap, and I’ve gone through the things that she’s going through right now, so maybe it’s just best for me to sit through this with her quietly or step in? 
Will she grow out of it?
Do I set up an intervention as her only companion and friend currently, and if so, how do I go about doing so without hurting her feelings and making sure she feels understood?

TLDR : my (25m) partner (20f) seems to be negligent in her own life. How do I set up an intervention, while minimizing the risk of fracture in our relationship?

I was standing there half awake, wearing my beat-up Hokas because, honestly with the hiking culture around campus you never really know when someone’s going to hit you with a “sunset trail later?” and suddenly you’re seven miles deep in the desert.  
  
While I was waiting for my drink, the barista complimented the person in front of me on their shoes. That tiny comment somehow turned into this whole mini-conversation between all of us about comfort, blisters, which trails destroy your feet the fastest and whether style even matters when you’re melting in the Arizona sun anyway.  
  
It wasn’t anything dramatic, but it kind of stuck with me.

heaven was a citadel of fireless purity
and hell a pit of teeth—
but I have lived enough years
to know every kingdom is lonelier
than the stories admit.

Some nights,
I lift my face to the stars
and speak to God like an old friend.
I tell Him I’m trying.
I tell Him I believe,
not out of fear
but out of familiarity.
I ask if the throne is heavy,
if creation ever aches His bones.

And sometimes
I remember the first son—
the fallen one—
and wonder if he still looks upward
with that ancient hunger.
I imagine finding him
on a splintered stone
at the edge of the world,
offering him my flask,
sharing the bitterness of fathers
who loved us in complicated ways.

As for the demons—
I’ve stopped calling them monsters.
They look more like overworked clerks,
holding half-cold coffee
after another night spent
filing the grievances of souls.

If heaven is gold,
and hell is ash,
then I am the dust between—
and I ache to speak
to every kingdom
that shaped me.

SO, you have to wipe the terrace tables anyway ,  WHAT IF every wipe is for profit ???

  
So, the smart Italian restaurants use WINE VINEGAR spray. The clear type , with low vinegar concentration.

  
The trick is the Vinegar has to smell like wine a little bit. Maybe they even mix clear white wine + a bit of alcohol into the mix.

  
THE TRICK :

The wine smelling vinegar spray obviously cleans and disinfects the tables without soap, etc...



The trick is the SMELL : a fresh wiped table with such a wine smelling vinegar spray smells like wine, so people ORDER WINE MORE !



NORMAL clear strong vinegar smell will NOT work !

It must be wine smelling vinegar spray. Maybe like some shot of white wine, 6% clear grape vinegar, maybe a shot of cleaning alcohol , if you also sell alcohol.



So, the customer experience is :

\+ Customer sits down.

\+ Waiter introduction.

\+ The terrace table gets disinfected with natural cleaners in front of customer. They feel like the table is clean.

\+ One can claim that all natural cleaners , which is true !

  
\+ The table now, smells like vine vinegar for a short while.

\+ Menu gets presented as the second step.



This Obviously works for terraces only, since the vinegar smell in the room would be a much different experience. the indoors better smell like food, fresh baked bread, coffee, etc...

I used to have so much more hope and motivation to expose myself to the world and try to get over this, but that motivation is gone and I don’t think I can get it back. I had a really horrible experience with an old roommate of mine, someone who is literally just a demon in human form and is quite possibly one of the most despicable and hateful people on the entire planet.

Before, I would hear the machine be loud and rattling, then hear the capsule pop open and the sound would smooth out as the water got the coffee and pressure applied. 

Now, it's just loud and rattling throughout. I'm concerned pressure is not being correctly applied and therefore coffee taste and quality is suffering (coffee tastes more bitter, yet less flavorful). 

I've also recently descaled with no change. Have you had this happen with your machine? Any advice?",1,1763490667.0,u_thestigsky,0,1.0,False

Apartment name “The Eddy”, it is in Harrison NJ. The amenities are pretty new, it has a closed gate pool, in building gym, river sidewalk, 24/7 concierge, and many meeting rooms for remote workday. My living room has this big 3-piece glass window, great views and lighting during the day. In-unit washer + dryer, dishwasher, high-ceilings, and river views

Rent: current rent is $2520. I will take care the application fees for you.

Other fees: water is $5 a month or something like that. I live by myself, so electricity was only between $30-40. The building(corridor) has its own heating system, so during the night, the room will usually go up to 24-25 Celsius, so I don’t need to turn on any heating during winter, which is a plus

10 mins walk to Path, different big commercial gym near by, coffee shop, five guys and other restaurants. Really safe neighborhood, closed guarded community.

A beautifully designed living room blends comfort, functionality, and personality. This guide walks you through every essential element, rule, measurement, trend, and styling trick you need.

# **1\. Core Principles of Living Room Design**

## **Space Planning**

A good living room _feels_ open and flows naturally.  
Key goals:

*   Smooth movement between areas
    
*   Balanced furniture placement
    
*   Clear pathways
    
*   Zero wasted or cluttered corners
    

### **Ideal Clearances**

| Item / Path | Ideal Measurement |
| --- | --- |
| Main walkways | 30–36 inches |
| Minimum walkway (small rooms) | 24 inches |
| Seating distance between people | 3–10 feet |

- - -

## **Lighting**

A well-lit living room uses _layers_ of light.

| --- | --- | --- |
| Ambient | General overall lighting | Ceiling lights, recessed lights |
| Task | Focused lighting for activities | Reading lamps, desk lamps |
| Accent | Highlights decor | Spotlights, picture lights, LED strips |

**Tip:** Avoid relying on one overhead light. It makes the room look flat.

- - -

## **Furniture Selection**

*   Choose pieces that match the scale of the room.
    
*   Comfort > looks.
    
*   Follow the Golden Ratio: **sofa length ≈ two-thirds of the wall length**.

Today when we met, she suggested I should get a job or do something, and she mentioned that she has a good job and earns a lot and still she asks me for money even after knowing that I'm unemployed atm... Honestly, my gut is telling me I’m being used. I’m an introvert and I don’t always know how to deal with these situations. How can I be more vigilant in the future?

1p0jqcz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p0jqcz,"Google just officially dropped Gemini 3.  Here is the launch day guide to get the best results from it including the new version of Nano Banana, the new Antigravity Agent for coding, Deep Research & NotebookLM updates, Veo video improvements.","TL;DR: Google just officially released Gemini 3, and it has some amazing new capabilities.

**New version of Nano Banana (Gemini 3 Image**): Finally fixes character consistency with Reference Seeds.

Veo 3.1: **Adds Ingredients-to-Video** (directors notes + assets = video).

**Antigravity: An Agentic IDE that builds full apps from a single prompt (if you use Spec-First prompting).**

**NotebookLM Deep Research**: Writes PhD-level reports by reading 100+ tabs for you.

**Verdict: It beats ChatGPT and Claude on almost every major benchmark.**

The wait is over. Google just pushed Gemini 3 live, and after 48 hours of non-stop testing, I can tell you this is not just an incremental update. The model feels less like a chatbot and more like an active collaborator that actually thinks before it speaks.

If you are still prompting it like it is 2024, you are getting bottom-tier results. Here is everything you need to know to get into the top 1% of users immediately.

**1. Nano Banana (Gemini 3 Image): The Consistency King**

Officially Gemini 3 Pro Image, but the Nano Banana codename stuck.

The Breakthrough: Identity Persistence The #1 pain point of AI art has always been keeping a character consistent across different shots. Nano Banana solves this with Reference Seeds. You no longer need complex LoRAs or ControlNets for basic consistency.

Top Use Case: Creating consistent influencers, comic book characters, or storyboards.

Pro Tip: Use the Anchor & Pivot workflow. Generate your perfect character, click Use as Reference, and then pivot the scene.

Old Prompt: A girl with pink hair in a coffee shop. -> Same girl in a park. (Result: Different girl). Gemini 3 Prompt: > Upload generated image of girl  
  
Command: Anchor Identity: \[Character\_Name\]. Scene Pivot: Sitting on a park bench reading a vintage book. Maintain facial structure and hair color exactly.  


**2. Veo 3.1: You Are Now the Director**

Veo has been upgraded to 3.1, and it finally listens to Directors Notes rather than just guessing.

The Breakthrough: Ingredients-to-Video You can now upload 3-5 reference images (characters, background, lighting style) and Veo will animate the scene using those exact assets rather than hallucinating new ones. This creates glitch-free transitions.

Top Use Case: Animating your Nano Banana images into 8-second cinematic clips or B-Roll.

Pro Tip: Use Motion Brush Syntax. You can define movement vectors in text.

Best Practice Prompt: > Reference: \[Image 1\], \[Image 2\].



Action: Cinematic pan right (speed: slow). Subject: The character in \[Image 1\] turns head 45 degrees to face camera. Lighting: Match ambient occlusion from \[Image 2\].



**3. Coding with Google Antigravity (The Agentic IDE)**

This is the sleeper hit of the release. Antigravity is not a chatbot; it is an environment. It has read/write access to a terminal, browser, and file system.

The Breakthrough: Self-Healing Code It writes code, runs it, sees the error, fixes the error, and redeploys.

Top Use Case: Building full-stack MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) in one shot.

Pro Tip: Use Spec-First Prompting.

Do not say: Make a French Bulldog game.

Do say: Write a [`spec.md`](http://spec.md) file for a French Bulldog game. Once I approve the spec, execute the code.

Why this matters: When you force Gemini 3 to write a specification file first, it grounds its logic. It will refer back to the spec file to self-correct when it hits a bug, rather than hallucinating a fix.

**4. NotebookLM + Deep Research: The REAL PhD in Your Pocket**

NotebookLM was already good. With Gemini 3s Deep Research agent integrated, it is overpowered.

The Breakthrough: Autonomous Scouting In Deep Mode, the agent spends 10-20 minutes scouring the web, reading PDFs, and cross-referencing data. It does not just summarize top Google results; it finds the primary sources.

Top Use Case: Market analysis, thesis vetting, and competitive intelligence.

Pro Tip: Give it a Persona & Mission, not a question.

Best Practice Prompt: > Act as a senior supply chain analyst.  
  
Mission: Investigate lithium battery bottlenecks for 2026. Constraints: Ignore mainstream news; focus on mining permits and raw material export bans in South America. Output: A briefing doc with citations, flagging 3 contrarian risks.

**5. Content & Infographics: Visual Logic**

Gemini 3 finally understands Visual Layouts. It can output data not just as text, but as rendered HTML cards, Mermaid charts, or infographic schemas.

Top Use Case: Turning a Deep Research report into a LinkedIn carousel instantly.

Pro Tip: Use the command Visualize as \[Format\].

Best Practice Prompt:  
  
Take the data from Section 3 of this report. Action: Visualize as a comparison matrix. Style: Dark mode, minimalist, high contrast. Format: SVG code ready for export.

**How to Get Top 1% Results (The Agentic Mindset)**

The biggest mistake people make with Gemini 3 is treating it like Gemini 1.5 or GPT-4. Stop prompting for answers; start prompting for workflows.

Chain the Tools: Use Nano Banana to make an image -> Send that image to Veo to animate it -> Use Antigravity to build a website to host it.

Toggle Deep Think: If you are doing math, coding, or complex logic, toggle on Deep Think. It forces the model to show its Chain of Thought (CoT), which reduces hallucinations by 90% in our testing.

The Critique Loop: Gemini 3 is exceptional at self-criticism.

Prompt: Write this code. Then, critique it for security vulnerabilities. Then, rewrite it fixing those vulnerabilities.

**Gemini 3 vs. ChatGPT (GPT-5) & Sora 2**

Creative Writing: Tie. GPT-5 still has a slight edge in human-sounding prose, but Gemini 3 has caught up significantly in nuance and humor.

Coding: Gemini 3 Wins. Google Antigravitys integration with the actual IDE and terminal gives it an edge over ChatGPTs Canvas for complex, multi-file builds.

Video: Veo 3.1 vs Sora 2. Sora 2 creates better fantasy physics, but Veo 3.1 wins on control. If you need a specific character to do a specific thing, Veo 3.1 follows instructions better.

Research: Gemini 3 Wins. NotebookLMs massive context window + Deep Research agent is currently unmatched for digesting huge datasets.
