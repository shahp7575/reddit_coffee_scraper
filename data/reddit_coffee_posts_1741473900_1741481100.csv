1j6veol,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1j6veol/chip_origin_and_development_and_purpose_theory/,Chip origin and development and purpose theory,"Maybe Cobel came up with the idea for the severance chip as a way to eliminate the need for ether as anesthetic because of the damage it was doing to people’s health. The Severance chip was intended to be an alternative to ether. Cobel and the other children at the factory needed to huff ether before they could “man the vat”/do intense labor for long periods of time. They needed something that would allow them to detach from themselves to get through something physically grueling. BUT the long term effects of being exposed to ether were not so great AKA her mom getting sick and dying, the sickly looking guy who is coughing while she brushes her teeth, Rose with a breathing tube in the coffee shop, etc. So, Harmony Cobel comes up with the idea for the Severance chip as an alternative for anesthesia that doesn’t have the same negative effects. Jame Eagan likes the idea, and they start experimenting to see how effective the chip is as an alternative to anesthesia in medical/dental situations. When doctors and dentists use anesthesia they literally call it “putting you under.” You should never know what happened when you’re under, like when you’re getting surgery. Then seeing how well it worked, the idea for the chip kept growing and they began testing it against the four tempers, woe, dread, malice, frolic. They’re testing how well the chip holds the barriers of emotion. They’re testing this on Gemma obviously on the testing floor, but also on Mark. Maybe seeing if his innie will be able to feel his outie’s grief over the loss of Gemma. Maybe they manufactured the meeting and romance between Burt and Irving and then had Burt leave to test if innie Irving’s heartbreak would bleed through to his outie. Will oDylan’s work ethic bleed through to iDylan? And then could even be, would iHelly’s anger bleed through to Helena? Numbers could somehow transmit something that Lumon knows their outies are scared of and they’re trying to see if fears surpass the chip (or something like that). In the wellness sessions, Miss Casey saying all the facts about their outies could correlate to the numbers they’re refining. The feelings about personal facts are all supposed to be “equal,” if you look at a screen of numbers (in our world), your feeling about each number should be relatively equal. But as we can see, the refiners have real reactions to the scary numbers. The numbers could be part of the code in the chip, so they’re seeing some sort of crack in their chip and then refining it to stop the feelings they get from the numbers from being able to get through the coding in the chip. So maybe now instead of the initial idea of using severance to replace ether, it’s turned into something that will not only allow you to not experience things you don’t want to, but also to not feel any particular way about these things when you’re in the severed state. Gemma could be the extreme test subject (which would explain Miss Casey), while all of the refiners are doing basically the same thing as her in a much less direct way. Maybe the files expire when Gemma completes them on the testing floor. Gemma and Mark are working on the same files, it’s just that Gemma is doing it on a microscopic scale (zoomed in, details) and Mark and the refiners are doing it on a macroscopic scale (zoomed out, broad, indirect).  Or it could also be that the numbers are parts of the code in Gemma’s chip. Every time she feels strongly in a room, it correlates to a number (or number sequence) in the chip’s code which then goes to MDR. They fix that part of the code, adjust her chip, then they send her back into the room to see where else they need to patch. Keeps going until she doesn’t feel strongly in any of the rooms. Essentially comatose but able to do whatever task is required of her (ties into themes of a monotonous, dreary 9-5 and forced child labor). 

I don’t know, this is all over the place. Curious what you all think. This is my first post so apologies if it makes no sense!

I go to an Eastern Orthodox Church, and this guy just recently visited. He seemed nice, and he started talking to me and my friend during Coffee hour. He talked to us abt the problems of the modern Catholic Church and what not. I did agree with some of it, but I didn’t speak on it too much because I’m not Catholic. 

He invited my friend and I to a Fat Tuesday dinner and the church he attends(it’s an Episcopal church that lets the SSPX have their services in their basement.) He showed us around the chapel, continued to talk down on the modern Catholic Church, but like I said, idk much abt it because I’m not Catholic. He’s been sending me a bunch of stuff abt it and invited me to a service tmr. I politely declined since tmr is the restoration of the icons and told him that idk if I’ll join the SSPX, but I like learning abt it and what not. He then told me that there’s only salvation in Rome(basically saying I’m not saved without actually saying it lol).

1j6vb0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1j6vb0v/never_found_my_people/,Never found “my people”!,"looking for advice, support, and maybe some sympathizing from those in a similar situation. sorry for the length, there’s a tldr! 


I grew up traveling around a bit, went to two different (very small, everyone knew each other since kindergarten) high schools (the second of which included my covid year so… extra hard to make friends!). From these places, I’ve only maintained relative closeness with two friends and a wonderful boyfriend, and then a couple more i semi-regularly have contact with. Buuuuuuut that’s okay, bc there’s always college, right?

Well…. I go/went to a small college far away from home with a niche student population (really rich and granola) which maybe wasn’t the best move! I def had a better time here, and am walking away with 3 pretty close friends (aren’t really close with each other though), and 3-5 friends who i’ll get a coffee with if im ever in their neck of the woods again. But no bridal party, no intimate friend group, etc. Most of these friends also struggled with my college’s social climate, but they take solace in their friend groups from back home. I’m no one’s number one!

Current Situation:

This hurts!!! I worked really hard on being a good friend these past few years. I invite friends to things, make an effort to be vulnerable, support and encourage them, and try to be friendly to people i know. I know that I’m a good friend! But what it feels like, though i have no problem making acquaintances or a couple of individual friends, is that no one really wants me in their closest circles :( i want people who would do anything for me (not literally, but you know), because that’s how i feel about my friends! 

im about to enter this new phase of my life, where everything gets harder— including social life! ive already had it hard, and its scary being chucked into the “real world” with no community or sense of belonging with a good group of girls. it makes me feel awful about myself, irreparably lonely, and embarrassed that i’m the only one that doesn’t have SOMETHING!

help :(

TLDR: graduating from college soon and realizing that i’ve never had a friend group/close community. super painful for me, considering ive put in a ton of effort! not having ever been anyone’s first choice or part of a close group makes me feel like there’s something wrong with me. and i feel like i’ve run out of time!",1,1741480263.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

I just got hit with a wave of recognition for this one Ao3 fan work that I really enjoyed. Unfortunately, crawling through my history has led to no results, either meaning the work got deleted or I deleted it from my history?

The key points that I remembered from this fic are based on one specific chapter that I hope can help jog someone’s memory.

1. The chapter was focused around the final(?) fight of the Sports festival between Izuku and Katsuki.

2. Before the fight started, the author switched perspectives to a gang of Izuku’s old bullies from Aldera going into a coffee shop or something similar and suddenly seeing the live footage of Izuku’s and Katsuki’s fight on screen.

3. Amongst the bullies was this one girl who was the fanfics recently introduced OC, a girl who’s quirk was based on sunflowers. Even though she had bullied Izuku in the past, she always felt a sense of admiration for his perseverance in wanting to become a hero despite his quirklessness status.

4. Also amongst the bullies was a girl who I believe was the main leader of the bully group who had feelings for the sunflower quirked OC; feelings that were not reciprocated.

5. After the battle I believe, the sunflower quirked OC felt more brave and told off all of the bullies before leaving the coffee shop altogether to head back home(?)

Bonus key points:

I think it was a Izuku harem fic?

Sunflower quirked OC was introduced a couple of chapters before when Izuku went to the mall with his friends, but she was just a small character in the specific chapter before the author extended her role.

I think it was a somewhat big fan work, with over 20 chapters for sure, though I may have been mistaken.

If anyone remembers reading a chapter like this from somewhere, please let me know if you remember the name of this Ao3 work!

No warning,didn't see it coming as our time together has been nothing short of perfect. Tales about marriage and having our own family. I've been the happiest I've ever been. Everything just fell into place for both of us. One morning I woke up to a text saying she's ending it as she will hurt me in the future and doesn't want a relationship. This was 4 weeks ago. We chatted again after a few days and it all seemed good and then she went cold again. Eventually she said she's been TALKING to another guy.

Never has really suffered. Never been stuck in a bad situation. Has lots of money, tons of time off, no housing worries, almost zero responsibilities.

I’ve got c-ptsd, migraines, fibromyalgia and this week I have the flu. I got sick with a cold last month. Every time I get sick(er than normal) my friend barely texts and sends me things like “aren’t you better?” “nice day, you should walk” “hiking is awesome” “Danced at the clubs all weekend”. 

When we hang, they always tell me what herbs I should try, what foods I should be eating, that I should volunteer more instead of work so hard.

I got a commission for a 2’ x 5’ (61cm x 152cm) table runner, times three. Specification was “as natural and food safe as possible”. 

We landed on hermann oak veg tan, dye with coffee (nothing special just really strong coffee - boiled two hours), and making a custom conditioner balm from jojoba (native to my region, but sourced from Argentina…) + local beeswax. 

I’m doing a parallel test strip and will see how well the beeswax repels liquid and oil. Probably, I will need to add a final seal layer using Bee Natural RTC, which is non toxic. 

I would normally dip dye or just buy drum dyed sides, but since this is kind of a $pecial commission, I decided to do it this way using a 4” (10cm) natural bristle brush. I will definitely need two or three coats of the coffee, particularly because the panel I dyed in this clip isn’t taking as well as the other two did…

- Feedback wanted—how do you brew it (pour-over, espresso?), roast level (light to keep it bright, or medium-dark?), and what flavors you crave from this gem.
- Bonus points: Tips from coffee geeks or startup hustlers—how do I make this a hit in India’s growing coffee scene?

DM me if you’re keen to taste or chat—I’d love some early adopters to sip, critique, and spread the word. This isn’t just coffee; it’s a passion project I’m pouring my heart into. Mods, hope this fits—aiming for a convo, not a sales pitch!

The U.S. government withdraws its request for Google to divest its AI-related assets amid ongoing antitrust investigations.

* The US Department of Justice has dropped its proposal for Google to divest from AI firms but still demands that Google sell its Chrome browser to address its alleged monopoly in online search.
* Prosecutors argue that Google’s dominance stifles market competition, while Google claims the proposed actions exceed the court's decision and would negatively impact consumers and national security.

1j6udga,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/1j6udga/want_to_help_me_build_a_nonprofit/,Want to help me build a Non-Profit?,"I am starting some Community programs and I have tried to get some grants and donations with little success so I decided to throw some of my own money into starting a company whose goal is to essentially shed light on local businesses and help bring money into the local community and away from Fortune 500 companies.

Currently around 17 to 22% of the local economy goes back into the local economy and one shape or another, the rest is essentially given to corporations and interests that are outside of the community. This number is dwindling every year.

...

I figured a way to combat this is to essentially build a website and publication that gets sent out to homeowners specifically spreading awareness of only locally owned businesses. If you want to shop or go to a gas station or get groceries or do anything to spend money you will be able to find out where you can go where that money will go back into the local economy.

I can also attach little digital Badges and give preference on rankings and visibility or whatever we decide on those who do more. For example wouldn't you rather buy from a coffee shop that gives back to Veterans, sponsors three little leagues helps fund for startup businesses from an entrepreneurial program and give over 5% of their income to help a cause-specific to the community you live in. Or you can buy coffee from the shop across the street whose owner is in a different city or state and they don't donate to any causes or help any community causes or whatever...

I can give people special badges on the website searches for those who give back to the community and those who are nonprofits and those who live locally ect.

I also plan on interviewing these people and putting them on camera and hearing their why as some people like to invest in hiking trails or they want to help fun teachers or have specific causes that other people might drive an extra 10 minutes to go shopping at their location knowing that the money goes to the same thing you care about.

I also want to create a podcast where we talk to people and specific Industries and Fields and have knowledge and are doing cool things etc.

I have a lot of cool ideas. I'm currently in the process of finding residual funding for this as currently I'm coming out of pocket for everything but I think if I created a website/app that could help build awareness and help the community grow in all sorts of ways and that website was used by the masses then it would fund Itself by donations instead of advertisers. In fact that could even become a problem because people could donate large sums and signal. Essentially making themself look like they are amazing people just so they could get a bunch of business.

...

I don't know what the answer is to this but I know I want to make it a non-profit as I want the profits of this organization to essentially go back into the community. I want the community to have a place that they can vote on where these funds go, who gets the most love, who's going to be on the cover of our monthly publication and website and podcasts and YouTube channels and essentially have a place where the community has a hyper local way to connect with one another by means of an organization whose profits go right back to them in one shape or another.

There's a lot more to it I'm definitely leaving a lot out as I've been thinking about this for well over a year and I have most of it lined up and figured out I'm just trying to dial in the profits and ethics in promoting the right businesses and individuals Etc.

...

I figured we could dial it in on Reddit with the community I want to serve. What do you guys think of this idea?",0,1741477443.0,SaltLakeCity,0,0.4,False

I’m searching the net high and low for answers on this (don’t have a follow up psych appointment for 2 months) 
I was on 30mgs of vyvance which wasn’t working, by 1pm I had hectic anxiety/agitation. About 3 weeks ago I got lifted to 50mgs and it’s great. I have zero desire to drink alcohol (myself medicating tool) I’m less reactive, and just better off for it. 
Here’s the catch though, I LOVE COFFEE! Although it’s always made me a bit tired. Now, when I take my med, jump up and have a coffee (or ahem, 2) I’m exhausted!! Which makes me have another coffee in a clearly misguided attempt for energy which makes me MORE tired. I’m talking, aggressively fatigued that I can’t function. 
I don’t know if it’s the coffee on its own, the increased vyvance on its own, or the combo of the 2 but has anyone else experienced this? 
It blows my mind I can take a high ish dose of a stimulant and be so fricken exhausted!

I’m a Pune-based coffee nut chasing a startup dream: coffee around the world in your cup! 
To start with : importing Ethiopian Yirgacheffe green beans and roasting them fresh right here. If you’ve ever sipped Yirgacheffe, you know the magic—those floral, citrusy notes that dance in your cup. I’m sourcing straight from Ethiopia, aiming to bring that specialty vibe to India at its peak freshness.

I’m roasting a small batch soon and need your help to get this off the ground:
- Who’s up to try some? Thinking ₹1,000/250g—worth it for that Yirgacheffe glow (thoughts on price?).
- Feedback wanted—how do you brew it (pour-over, espresso?), roast level (light to keep it bright, or medium-dark?), and what flavors you crave from this gem.
- Bonus points: Tips from coffee geeks or startup hustlers—how do I make this a hit in India’s growing coffee scene?

DM me if you’re keen to taste or chat—I’d love some early adopters to sip, critique, and spread the word. This isn’t just coffee; it’s a passion project I’m pouring my heart into. Mods, hope this fits—aiming for a convo, not a sales pitch!

What I want is someplace where I can buy an *okay* house in an *okay* neighborhood at a reasonable cost (say $250k max) - not fancy or super nice, just “meh” but someplace where I can just quietly exist and work from home with a low likelihood of being robbed/murdered or having to undertake immediate major renovations. (I currently own such a house, I understand what I'm asking for.)

Major cities are fine, so are smaller ones (say in the 80-100k population range)

I cannot overstate how much I dislike sunny weather

Blue or purple state

Eastern or Central time zone would be ideal but not a must-have

Normal seasons are fine, would prefer someplace that doesn’t have extreme temps in summer or winter

Someplace with a major airport would be ideal, but being within 1-2 hours of one is doable

Preferably some degree of legal cannabis (medical or recreational)

This is probably weird and is by no means a deciding factor, but I feel more at ease in a place that’s a bit grungy but has atmosphere compared to someplace shiny and affluent. 

I’m not big into outdoor activities, so I don’t have strong feelings about the kind of landscape. Being near some type of water would be nice - my first thought is a lake or river but no objection to a coastal area either.

Not too concerned about walkability

In terms of personal preferences, I’m honestly pretty basic. I like breweries and coffee shops and catching the occasional hockey game. I also read a lot so having one or more independent bookstores and/or a good library system would be a plus. ",10,1741477288.0,SameGrassButGreener,31,0.86,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the classic Duke vs. North Carolina rivalry, where the stakes are as high as the number of times Coach K has been asked if he's ever considered retirement. This Saturday, the Blue Devils, riding a seven-game win streak, are looking to secure the ACC regular season title and continue their dominance over the Tar Heels. Meanwhile, North Carolina is desperately trying to avoid being the bubble team that pops.

Duke is favored by 10.5 points, and with a 79.1% chance of winning, it's like betting on whether the sun will rise tomorrow. But let's not forget, underdogs win about 25% of the time in basketball, and the Tar Heels are led by RJ Davis, who is averaging 17.2 ppg and probably has a grudge list longer than a CVS receipt.

On the other hand, Duke's freshman sensation Cooper Flagg is averaging 19.6 ppg and is probably already being scouted by the NBA and several shoe companies. The Blue Devils have covered the spread in six straight games, which is more consistent than my morning coffee routine.

Now, if you're feeling adventurous and have a soft spot for underdogs, you might want to consider the Tar Heels at +9.5 with odds around 1.95. After all, they have covered the spread in five straight games, and nothing says ""March Madness"" like a bubble team with a chip on its shoulder.

For those who prefer a safer bet, the under on the total points at 160.5 seems like a solid choice, as the SportsLine model is leaning that way. But remember, betting on college basketball is like trying to predict the weather in March—unpredictable and often leaves you wondering why you didn't just stay inside.

So, grab your popcorn, maybe a stress ball, and enjoy the game. Just remember, whether you're betting on the Blue Devils or the Tar Heels, you're really just betting on which shade of blue you prefer.",1,1741477170.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

Would love input!,"**\*This is not a properly run, formal experiment with controls, etc. And I am not recommending anybody try any of this without first talking to their doctor. And I'm not looking for medical advice.\***

\---

**History / Context**

* Diagnosed 3 years ago.
* I have been on the non-stimulant Strattera (Atomoxetine) the entire time.
   * Started at 40mg, up to 80mg, down to 60mg. I've been on 60mg for 3 months.
* It was no longer effective so I tried my friend's 40mg Vyvanse and it was life changing.

That brings me to my current ""experiment"". I was originally meant to wean off Strattera while doing a week of Vyvanse at 20mg then come off Strattera and raise my dose up to 40mg. However; I have a lot of Strattera left and I've heard from friends on Vyvanse that one of the hardest parts of the day is the drop off when the meds wear off (a drop off I never felt with Strattera).

So I spoke to my doctor about staying on both long-term to see if the combination of meds will work for me. He did some quick searching to make sure its safe enough to try and then approved me for my experiment as long as I check in once a month to make sure I'm not having crazy negative side effects or unexpected interactions.

**Experiment**

The timing is intended to help me get through a full day of school (8-5) and work on weekends (12-9).

* Vyvanse - 20mg 8:30am (morning)
* Atomoxetine - 60mg 12:30pm (afternoon)
   * I don't want to waste meds, but I may ask to lower this down to 40mg if the 60 is too much now that I am on both.

**Expectations:** The Vyvanse will give me motivation in the morning that gets me to school and able to retain what I learn. The Atomoxetine will smooth out the peak of the Vyvanse and keep me going for the rest of the day, ease the drop-off from the Vyvanse around 7pm, and help me sleep by a reasonable time.

**Reflections:** It has been just under a week and it is going quite well! I'll keep my reflections brief.

* Appetite: No problem with eating breakfast, but I keep forgetting lunch. Struggling to eat dinner.
   * I'll make sure to keep small snacks on me (fruit and nuts) so that if I can't eat a full meal I still have nutritious food.
* Motivation: Able to get through the entire day with no issues!  I even made time for hobbies!
* Mood: So much more stable than with Atomoxetine. Generally happy. Almost no anxiety!
* Caffeine: I need to quit coffee. It does NOT pair well for me.
* Other: Tried taking a day off Vyvanse during a work day (today). I slept until 11am and have been having a really hard time doing anything at all. I want to sleep and cry.
   * I will definitely be a daily-use person unless something else comes up.

Overall, it turns out there ARE enough hours in the day to do all the things I want/need to do when I'm properly medicated. This is both a wonderful feeling combined with a certain grief and sadness at all the time I have wasted.

It takes the ""edge"" off of Caffeine. When I drink coffee (which doesn't have Taurine), I get VERY stimulated, to the point where it can become overwhelming. When I drink energy drinks, though, I feel nothing.

To find a happy medium, I ordered Taurine supplements. I drink one or two cups of coffee, and when I want the stimulation to end, I take a Taurine (1000mg) and it completely stops the overenergized feeling.

However, sometimes, at night when I go to bed, if I took Taurine that day, I get a racing heart.

But if I drink like 10 Monsters (not literally, but I can handle a lot), nothing like this happens?? The energy drinks normally have 1000mg also.

Why is this? Is the supplement version being metabolized differently? What if a mix the Taurine into a drink? 

When I take electrolytes and a multivitamin, it makes the racing heart better, which makes sense as, to my understanding, it modulates effects on the heart and electrolytes have to do with that.

Does anyone here have success with Taurine? Any thoughts?

Today, I suddenly cannot get a shot that isn’t sour.  When I grind a bit finer, it improves a little, and when I nudge it one setting finer again I get half the yield in the cup that I did before and it’s still sour.  Where the heck does the water go if it’s not in the cup?? I understand that some will be retained in the puck, but that much?

I was using the machine’s preset 2-cup shot, which was really convenient.
When I manually ran a shot until I reached the ratio I wanted, it took a long time, but did taste better. Not great, but better.  

What gives? The one-month old beans are one day older, stored in airtight container.  Prep exactly the same, weigh dose in, calibrated tamp, brew temp unchanged, but suddenly the coffee isn’t good.

Choosing the perfect furniture set for your living room is a significant decision that influences the overall aesthetics and functionality of your home. A well-coordinated furniture set not only enhances comfort but also reflects your personal style. When selecting a furniture set for your living room, consider the size, color scheme, and layout of the space to ensure harmony and balance.

One popular choice in living room furniture sets is the sectional sofa. Sectionals are ideal for larger spaces, providing ample seating and versatility. They can be arranged in various configurations to fit your room's layout, and many designs include built-in storage solutions. Incorporating a coffee table and accent chairs can complete the look, making your living area both inviting and functional.

For smaller living rooms, consider a reclining sofa set. These furniture sets offer comfort without sacrificing space, allowing you to enjoy cozy movie nights or gatherings with friends. Opt for furniture with a streamlined design, which helps maintain an open feel in compact areas.

Color and material choices are essential elements when picking a furniture set. Durable fabrics like microfiber or leather are popular for high-traffic areas, ensuring your living room looks great even with daily use. Light colors can make a space feel larger, while darker hues add sophistication and warmth.

Don't forget to accessorize your living room furniture set with complementary decor. Throw pillows, area rugs, and artwork can enhance the overall theme, tying everything together beautifully. Incorporating these design elements will contribute to a cohesive vision that transforms your living room into a personal retreat.

In summary, selecting the right furniture set for your living room is all about blending style, comfort, and practicality. With careful consideration of your space, lifestyle, and personal preferences, you can create a living room that truly feels like home.

# Food

Penny For Pound has built a strong reputation for its pastries, coffee, and baked goods, with many customers describing them as some of the best in Melbourne. The croissants, in particular, receive consistent praise, with one reviewer stating, *""Best croissants in Richmond!""* and another calling them *""crazy good here.""* Almond croissants stand out as a customer favorite, frequently noted for their buttery and flaky texture, as well as their well-balanced filling. One visitor remarked, *""Their almond croissant is so buttery and flaky. Not to mention the filling inside is just delicious.""*

Beyond croissants, the cruffins also draw enthusiastic feedback, with flavors like salted caramel and lemon curd receiving standout mentions. One guest shared, *""My new favourite dessert I've ever eaten in my whole life comes from this place – the lemon curd cruffin!""* Seasonal offerings, such as the passionfruit cruffin and sticky date hot cross bun, add to the bakery’s allure, keeping the menu fresh and exciting.

Savory options, such as the turkey sub and ham and cheese croissant, are generally well received, although one customer noted the latter didn’t quite measure up to the excellence of the sweet pastries. Cakes, including the red velvet and carrot cake, are also highlights, with one visitor describing the carrot cake as *""majestic in appearance and wholesome to taste.""* Overall, Penny For Pound’s menu boasts a mix of classic and inventive pastries, with quality ingredients and expert craftsmanship at the heart of every offering.

# Value

Pricing at Penny For Pound sparks mixed opinions, though many diners agree that the quality of the food justifies the cost. Some customers find the pastries slightly expensive, with one review noting, *""A tad expensive but great pastries and coffee,""* while another highlighted the price of a pastry rising with card surcharges. However, most agree that the superior taste and craftsmanship make the experience worthwhile. One customer summed it up well: *""Bit on the pricey side but the quality justifies the extra couple of dollars.""*

The portion sizes are widely praised, with customers often mentioning their satisfaction with the quantity and presentation. One visitor recounted how a staff member added extra pastries to their order, calling it a *""sweet and lovely""* gesture. Another appreciated the bakery’s approach, sharing, *""They couldn’t fulfill my whole order but replaced it with another of greater value.""* For those looking for a special treat, Penny For Pound delivers on both taste and portion size, making it a compelling choice despite its premium pricing.

# Experience

Penny For Pound’s customer service is a recurring highlight, with visitors frequently commending the friendly and welcoming staff. One customer enthusiastically shared, *""Matilda and Ben make the best croissants and cruffins I have ever tasted... and they are such a gorgeous young couple. Humble and unassuming.""* Another guest noted, *""The girls who served me today are absolute queens who know how to make a good coffee.""*

Many reviews emphasize the warm and inviting interactions with employees, often describing them as generous, knowledgeable, and attentive. One customer recalled, *""The trendy guy that served me gave me both the almond and raspberry croissant when I couldn't decide—10/10 service.""* Another highlighted how the bakery went above and beyond to rectify an order issue, saying, *""The personalized and above-and-beyond service really was outstanding.""*

Despite the high traffic, the team manages to maintain a high level of professionalism and enthusiasm. However, some visitors have noted that the shop can get quite busy, leading to minor delays. Even so, most agree that the service quality makes up for the wait, with one reviewer affirming, *""The place does get busy simply because of how yummy everything is, so you may need to wait a little bit in the queue—but it’s definitely worth the wait!""*

# Ambience

The bakery’s setting receives mixed reviews, largely due to its compact size. Many describe Penny For Pound as a ""hole in the wall"" bakery, with limited seating options and a focus on takeaway. One customer described it as *""a tiny bakery behind Mayday, selling the most amazing croissants, doughnuts, cruffins, and mini cakes and tarts.""*

The lack of seating does not seem to deter visitors, as most are happy to grab their pastries and coffee to-go. The shop’s aesthetic appeal and the tantalizing aroma of freshly baked goods add to its charm. As one reviewer put it, *""The smell is intoxicating, and it is a sight to behold.""* The location itself is also considered a hidden gem, with multiple visitors expressing their delight in discovering it. One excitedly shared, *""Oh my! What a find!""*

While space constraints may limit the dine-in experience, the bakery’s emphasis on takeaway makes it a perfect stop for those looking to grab a high-quality pastry and coffee on the go. Many customers appreciate the warm and welcoming atmosphere created by the staff, which compensates for the lack of seating.

Enter Boomer wearing a Trump 2024 hat, flannel, a headset, and carrying what I can only assume were two 42oz coffee jugs. He walked right up to the counter and took a single breath before he started complaining to whomever he was talking to on his headset. 

""It's impossible to get anyone to do their fu**ing jobs anymore. I'm standing here and nobody is here to help me. Ridiculous.""

The cashier shows up after maybe another 10-15 seconds and asks for his order. He hmms and hawws for a moment as he looks at the menu for the first time since he got there and looks back down at her--""No breakfast?!""

The cashier apologies and has to tell him twice that they stopped serving breakfast at 11am (its 11:54am). 

He scoffs loudly, picks up his two giant coffee mugs and walks off without saying another word. Literally just walks away mid-conversation. The cashier just watched him go--confused.

On one hand, their financials are to the point where even if the actual numbers were 1/4 of what they actually are, that’s a P/E of 60 for a company growing at over 100% yoy (if that part is true) 

Seems BDO did sign off on the 10k, but they expressed concern. The market ran the price up to $66 before the 10k dropped and today we are sitting at half of that. The drop in NVDA I’m sure made people less confident in their partners. But the price seems undervalued tremendously if their accounting is even in the same planet as what is reported this company looks like a great future hold. 

There have been some insider sells recently ; and that has scared some people. But people buy stocks only when they think they will make money from it, they sell for many reasons, so that alone is not enough to say this thing is going to 0. 

The only concern I really have is their accounting. It seems from what I am reading BDO disclosed issues . But I am only basing that on comments that I read here, I don’t know what the actual words they used mean , and the seriousness of them. Are the consequences from this bad enough to the point where they could get delisted? Are they minor enough where a firing and a rehiring of a CFO would absolve them of all sins? Are they minor enough that paying a small fine is all that they need to do? 

I have no experience in dealing with account fraud and what the potential experiences could be. 
In 1999 waste management had a huge accounting scandal and the company is up over 1,000% since then. Not the best example, but microstrategy had accounting issues and the stock on a split adjusted basis down to $0.27 now it is over $250 a share. (Tech company in bubble area and became valuable because BTC so who knows really) , Merck had accounting issues in 2002 and the share price has about doubled since 2002. 
Luckin coffee recently had accounting issues in 2000 that moved the stock down to $0.95 and today it is around $30. 
Not saying that SMCI is like any of the above companies because I don’t know what their issues really look like. But I would love someone with more understanding of situations like this to comment. 

There are plenty of companies that are on the list of accounting fraud that are no longer around , so having accounting issues is not always a buy signal.

She has a point; I need to be at work in an hour and I can't be late on my first day. I jump out of bed in a hurry and forget all about the heart monitor hooked up to my chest. The same monitor I always have to sleep with every single night no matter how uncomfortable it may be. I get tangled up in the cords as I rush to get myself ready and free myself from the irritating wires connected to an annoying machine that will beep obnoxiously if my heart stops in my sleep.

A lot of good that would do if I’m already dead. I wish I wasn't born with this heart defect, but we can't all be winners can we? After I get myself untangled, I get my clothes together then rush to the bathroom for a shower. I turn the handle all the way to the right and to my surprise the water remains cold as if someone had been standing under the hot water for hours.

“Aubrey, did you take a shower already”? I yell down the hall already knowing the answer. “Sorry”, she screams back in a sarcastic voice knowing that she isn’t really sorry, but still it’s nice to hear her say it. I guess if I woke up a little earlier, I could take a shower first, but I've never really been a morning person.

After my freezing shower, I hurry and get my clothes on to have some sort of relief from the air brushing up against my already cold body. I begin to brush my naturally blonde hair so I can look professional on this very important day. After getting dressed in my fancy red skirt that I just bought two days ago, I grab a nice pair of black sunglasses to hide my blue eyes that are probably a nice shade of red right now from still being so tired. I run out of the bathroom, grab my keys, and head out the door. As I approach my piece of shit two door car that's almost 30 years old, I pray that it starts right up the first time I try.

“Please, I can't be late on my first day of work” I say while closing my eyes and talking to whatever higher power might be out there somewhere listening. I hop in and put the key in the ignition then turn it slowly hoping that it's going to be a good day. The car starts up on the first try and I kiss the steering wheel while bouncing up and down in excitement. I then back out of the driveway and head down the road to Clark’s enterprise, the top publishing company in my small town of Illinois. The whole drive there feels like an eternity, and I’m so nervous that part of me doesn’t even want to go, but I know I have to. This has literally been my dream since I was a little girl and it’s finally coming true.

I pull into the parking lot, and look for the spot that has my name on it. There it is, Miss brown written in all black on a white sign, calling me in as if it were saying “this is your own special spot”. I turn the car off then get out and start heading to the front door. I can feel my heart beating out of my chest with the anxiety from thinking about what the day is going to bring.

I'm very fortunate to have found a job right away even though I have to start as a secretary. The job posting did say I would be helping out with the publishing process as well so that’s a plus. I’ve always loved reading and I want to be someone people can come to with their fictional stories and bring them to life. After walking into the building, I notice how big and beautiful it is inside. All of the walls have the most intriguing paintings that I have ever seen and the one that sticks out the most is a painting of two little girls with blonde hair and blue dresses standing side by side and staring up at the night sky. It reminds me of Aubrey and I when we were little.

We've been friends ever since I can remember, and we would always sit outside on my trampoline while trying to make shapes out of the stars. I’ve always had this intense admiration with the planets and stars. There’s just something about the deep, dark parts of the night sky that you don’t really understand and the more you look at it, the more it draws you further and further into its mysterious void. I don't know why we even had that stupid trampoline, it's not like I could ever jump on it because of my heart condition but it was still fun to lay on, nonetheless.",0,1741476141.0,authors,4,0.33,False

We were still in school in the first year so obviously we couldn’t gift each other fancy stuff. When I got my first job I essentially supported my boyfriend financially because he was still in school. I bought him an old car for him make gigs with (which he now paid me off), i paid for our dates. I also have financial responsibilities and debts so i couldn’t buy myself anything super expensive. 
My boyfriend now has a high paying job. He makes twice as much as me and doesn’t have a debt.
Im happy he’s able to buy himself things now - gaming computer, other tech stuff
I recently mentioned i really wanted to buy the dyson airwrap id because i havent bought myself anything fancy before and it would make my life easier (secretly hoping he would gift me that instead) today on womens day he forgot to wish or get me anything which i was visibly upset about but i let it go. Later in the day I mentioned that i was hoping hed gift the blower but he said i was being unreasonable and i should get a drink from starbucks instead as a womens day present 
Initially i felt horrible because it felt as though he thought I was only worth a cup of coffee but I am having second thoughts that maybe i was infact being unreasonable and we havent been seeing each other long enough for him to buy things?

Mark's innie is (in S1 at least) a reasonably motivated, upbeat worker with some light skepticism. Mark's outtie is cynical and depressed. Helena's innie is down-to-earth, her outie is a ruthless executive. Dylan's innie is a motivated worker, his outtie's ""kind of a fuck up"". We've less of outtie Irving, but he seems a little more mature and less naive than his innie.

But Burt's outie seems a lot like his innie. They both just seem like gentle, kindly old men. Afaict he's the only character who's outtie really does not seem at all different from his innie.

\-----

When Burt's husband mentions that Burt was a bad person in the past, I was immediately very surprised. It seems totally uncharacteristic of Burt. People change, sure, but it was still sort of jarring -- I would not have at all guessed that based on Burt's demeanor.

\-----

Outie Burt and Irving seem to have a lot of chemistry. Obviously that's not *that* crazy; their innies had chemistry. But we've already seen a different couple this season who's outie does not have the same chemistry as his innie: Dylan's wife clearly has more chemistry with his innie right now.

And outtie Burt seems to like Irving a lot -- a stranger shows up at his door unannounced, and he's not only not freaked out, but he wants to see him again. And not just to chat over coffee or something. He invites him into his home for an intimate dinner with his husband, and immediately asks to see him again one-on-one.

\-----

If we're to take Burt and his husband at their word about why Burt is severed: wouldn't it be a little weird for his husband to get to heaven and meet Burt's innie for the very first time? It's better than nothing, sure, but you could easily imagine Burt's husband wanting to get to know the man he'll be spending eternity with in heaven.

1j6tp3v,https://i.redd.it/sc6j1zttsjne1.jpeg,"2 weeks post-op, down 19lb since starting pre-op, feeling amazing","I did not expect to feel so good at barely 2 weeks post-op. I was so worried I’d be so fatigued for months on so few calories but I’m having the opposite experience.
Just want to share my experience and some tips I’ve learnt along the way so far:

- My energy has been amazing since about day 5. I took 2 weeks off work and spent the second week just going for long walks (10k steps everyday) and watching tv and catching up on life admin and chores.
- My hair is already falling out more than normal but I know that’s part of the course and I’m ok with it. I’m taking 10-15g of collagen a day and my multivitamin and I know that’s all I can really do.
- I’ve been hitting 80g+ protein everyday since day 5, and now most days I can even get 120g. This is super important to me to try to preserve my muscle mass.
- I haven’t felt hungry even once, and I think it’s because I hit my protein and hydration goals every single day 
- hydration has been easy, I just sip on protein shakes and protein water (I love the muscle nation mango passionfruit one) and have sugar free ice blocks/popsicles to get me through
- I’ve been having an iced coffee most days (ok by my dietitian) I just drink it slowly while walking
- sleep has been harder so I’ve been taking magnesium for sleep (glycinate form is good for sleep, don’t get magnesium oxide)
- I’m using silicon tape on my scars to help them flatten and heal, it’s great
- all in all I kinda can’t believe I didn’t do this sooner. I had lost 100lb on my own previously over 2 years and kept it off for about 4 years, but then slowly regained it due to being more sedentary and losing portion control. This is an amazing bf second chance for me and I won’t waste it
- I did cheat on my pre-op diet a few times (I was on 3 week optifast diet) and I think it’s because I kept weight lifting during pre-op and the extra exertion of that was driving my appetite. I probably should’ve stopped weight lifting and just walked, but I wanted to preserve my muscle as long as I could. In retrospect I should’ve talked to my surgeon about a modified pre-op diet eg an extra optifast shake daily to compensate for my activity

1j6tlqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1j6tlqn/my_husbands_relationship_with_a_coworker_is/,My husbands relationship with a coworker is making me feel insecure,"My husband of 7 years started an hr assistant job in August. I was proud of him for finally getting his foot in the door and would love hearing his stories on his way from work to the house since that was our only bonding time without the kids. Around October I started to notice this woman, let’s call her Jessica, would start to call him often. There was this one time in which we were at a kids birthday party and I saw her calling him. He didn’t answer, and then I saw her calling again. I found this strange because my husband’s job does not require to take work home. I didn’t say anything because I was talking to another mom at the time. There was another time I was in the car with him, and I saw her sending my husband voice memos, so at this time I found this to be a red flag, as my husband wouldn’t really mention Jessica. I then started to notice that coming home from work he would cut the phone calls short. So one night I went through his phone, and saw that several messages from Jessica were deleted. When I retrieved them, it would be about her telling him to call her. The other coworkers he had, which the majority are women, still had the message thread showing, in other words they were not deleted. I also noticed that the reason why my husband started to hang up with me was to talk to her. So I confronted my husband and he swore that there was nothing going on, and that he just wanted to know the office “cheese”. I was vocal to him that it disturb me that he was deleting and hiding stuff and he’s making it seem like something is going on besides the usually office gossip. He promised that he was not going to delete anything. I noticed that the phone calls stopped, so I had gotten over it. Around December we got in an argument, and I just had a strong intuition, so I checked his recently deleted messages and I saw Jessicas message thread in there again (in which he had deleted three hours prior). I was confused because it wasn’t anything “bad” just her asking how he bought the Disney tickets and thanking him for showing her a feature on the iPad. I asked him if he had deleted anything recently and he swore in our marriage that he did not. So that made me lose trust in him, and when I told him that I saw that he had deleted Jessica’s thread again, he claimed that he had forgotten.

I swallowed his story and moved on, shortly after I was going through a health scare so I was awfully quiet. Because of how I was acting he carried the belief that I went through his phone (which I had not), and he basically told on himself that she had sent him a friend request. At this moment I didn’t care if he accepted the request or not, I just told him to do what he thought was best. 

Fast forward, this past week, one day at lunch I realized that I had not spoken to him so I gave him a call. He initially declined my call but when I called again, I heard a woman laugh in the background. I assumed it was Jessica and I hung up. Ten minutes later he promised that it was not her and that him and four female coworkers went to go have lunch, and he was getting out the car. For some reason I did not believe him. After it becoming a huge argument at home, the following day, I opened his laptop and saw that he was talking about the situation with Jessica. Jessica told him that she was scared and he comforted her saying not to worry and that everything was going to be okay. She told my husband that I was psycho, and my husband replied with a “yeah I know”. To top it off I saw him venting to the other female coworkers about it.

This is coming from a person that blew up when I called work one time and a male coworker happened to answer the phone and he claimed that I had a “flirty” voice. He also got upset that my team was bought coffee and claimed that “ no other man would be buying my wife coffee”. So now we’re allowed to go to lunch with them, take personal calls out of work and hear them vent? He claims that he is not cheating, but I feel otherwise. I am at a lost, I felt like I lost my marbles this week and my therapist is out in vacation for three weeks. What is everyone’s opinions on this? Today he mentioned about me “chilling” for the weekend and we can start going to marriage counseling; but internally I feel depressed and down.",10,1741475257.0,Marriage,16,0.99,False

At what point will Bitcoin’s price get so high that regular folks stop thinking in terms of “one Bitcoin” and shift to Satoshis instead?

You know, like how we don’t buy houses in kilos of gold—we use smaller units that feel more relatable. I’m betting this flips when BTC hits $1 million.

Why?

At that price, a full Bitcoin becomes absurdly out of reach for most people. I did some napkin math based on global wealth stats: only about 0.2% of the world’s population—roughly 16-31 million people—could realistically afford a $1M item (depending on how liquid their wealth is).

That leaves 99.8% of us priced out of ever owning a whole coin.

When a single BTC is a millionaire’s game, the average person’s mindset will have to shift to smaller units, right?

At $1M per BTC, one Satoshi (0.00000001 BTC) would be worth $0.01—a penny.

Suddenly, talking about “100,000 Satoshis” ($10) or “1 million Satoshis” ($100) feels a lot more practical than saying “0.0001 BTC.” It’s psychological—people like dealing in numbers that don’t require a magnifying glass to read the decimals.We’re already seeing some of this with “Sats” popping up in discussions, but I think $1M is the threshold where it becomes the norm. Imagine buying a coffee for “500 Satoshis” instead of “0.000005 BTC”—it just clicks better.

1j6tj8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/usask/comments/1j6tj8v/anyone_else_feeling_lonely/,Anyone else feeling lonely?,"Hi Everyone. Just wanted to come on here and get everyone else's opinions on this loneliness epidemic that many of us students and young people are experiencing. I will start with my story and see if anyone has advice. 

I’m a grad student at the U of S getting my masters. I was also at the U of S asked for my undergrad. Covid-19 and lockdown occured, switching classes online making it hard to connect and make friends.

When classes resumed in person for the 2021-2022 school year, I made an effort and went on BUMBLE BFF to make friends. I also stayed up in Saskatoon for the summer of 2022 and made work friends. All these efforts resulted in a few friend groups to hang out with during my undergrad, I found as I moved to grad school, my undergraduate friends, and the friends who had graduated became more distant. 

Despite my efforts asking every weekend and sometimes during the week to hang out, no one is ever available. People are busy with their significant others, midterms, and other projects. I’m the planner in my friend group, so I’m used to planning a bunch of events and things to do with friends. No one has time to even take a short coffee break with me for half an hour. It gets exhausting getting rejections every single weekend when I ask people to do things. 

Now that I’m done my classes in my masters, it’s a lot of solo research work, adding to the loneliness. Luckily, I have a good community at my part-time job, so I feel better when I’m around those people. However, when I’m alone, I still feel down. My family is three hours away and I could visit but I am a student so I’m trying to save money on gas and travel. 

I try to get out in public, even if I’m on my own and go and go for walks and walk around stores. Getting out makes me feel better, however, I can only do so much of this alone. 

I’d also like to preface that I’m not blaming my friends for being super busy with school and their partners, I just wanted to see if anyone else was feeling the same way. 

Does anyone else feel the vibe that people are more antisocial nowadays or they can’t take study breaks to hangout with friends? Is anyone else feeling lonely? Got any advice?

1j6tizp,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1j6tizp/i_would_like_your_opinions_on_the_first_few_pages/,I would like your opinions on the first few pages of my novel.,"I'm writing an adult fiction romance novel and I would like your opinion on the first few pages. Please note this is my first draft and I haven't done any heavy editing or anything yet.

As I wake up to the annoying sound of my alarm, I reach over to turn it off and get punched in the face by the hot sun peeking through the open blinds of my window. Great, another blistering summer day, I whisper to myself. My roommate walks in with her eyes wide open and a stupid smile on her face, holding her cup of coffee and waiting for me to get out of bed. I’ve always been so jealous of her beautiful, brown hair that always remains so straight even when she just rolled out of bed.

“Hurry Zoey, you need to get ready for your first day at your new job”, she says as she walks out of the room closing the door behind her so I can have my privacy. She has a point; I need to be at work in an hour and I can't be late on my first day. I jump out of bed in a hurry and forget all about the heart monitor hooked up to my chest. The same monitor I always have to sleep with every single night no matter how uncomfortable it may be. I get tangled up in the cords as I rush to get myself ready and free myself from the irritating wires connected to an annoying machine that will beep obnoxiously if my heart stops in my sleep.

A lot of good that would do if I’m already dead. I wish I wasn't born with this heart defect, but we can't all be winners can we? After I get myself untangled, I get my clothes together then rush to the bathroom for a shower. I turn the handle all the way to the right and to my surprise the water remains cold as if someone had been standing under the hot water for hours.

  
“Aubrey, did you take a shower already”? I yell down the hall already knowing the answer. “Sorry”, she screams back in a sarcastic voice knowing that she isn’t really sorry, but still it’s nice to hear her say it. I guess if I woke up a little earlier, I could take a shower first, but I've never really been a morning person. 

After my freezing shower, I hurry and get my clothes on to have some sort of relief from the air brushing up against my already cold body. I begin to brush my naturally blonde hair so I can look professional on this very important day. After getting dressed in my fancy red skirt that I just bought two days ago, I grab a nice pair of black sunglasses to hide my blue eyes that are probably a nice shade of red right now from still being so tired. I run out of the bathroom, grab my keys, and head out the door. As I approach my piece of shit two door car that's almost 30 years old, I pray that it starts right up the first time I try. 

“Please, I can't be late on my first day of work” I say while closing my eyes and talking to whatever higher power might be out there somewhere listening. I hop in and put the key in the ignition then turn it slowly hoping that it's going to be a good day. The car starts up on the first try and I kiss the steering wheel while bouncing up and down in excitement. I then back out of the driveway and head down the road to Clark’s enterprise, the top publishing company in my smalltown of Illinois. The whole drive there feels like an eternity, and I’m so nervous that part of me doesn’t even want to go, but I know I have to. This has literally been my dream since I was a little girl and it’s finally coming true.

  
I pull into the parking lot, and look for the spot that has my name on it. There it is, Miss brown written in all black on a white sign, calling me in as if it were saying “this is your own special spot”. I turn the car off then get out and start heading to the front door. I can feel my heart beating out of my chest with the anxiety from thinking about what the day is going to bring.

I'm very fortunate to have found a job right away even though I have to start as a secretary. The job posting did say I would be helping out with the publishing process as well so that’s a plus. I’ve always loved reading and I want to be someone people can come to with their fictional stories and bring them to life. After walking into the building, I notice how big and beautiful it is inside. All of the walls have the most intriguing paintings that I have ever seen and the one that sticks out the most is a painting of two little girls with blonde hair and blue dresses standing side by side and staring up at the night sky. It reminds me of Aubrey and I when we were little. 

We've been friends ever since I can remember, and we would always sit outside on my trampoline while trying to make shapes out of the stars. I’ve always had this intense admiration with the planets and stars. There’s just something about the deep, dark parts of the night sky that you don’t really understand and the more you look at it, the more it draws you further and further into its mysterious void. I don't know why we even had that stupid trampoline, it's not like I could ever jump on it because of my heart condition but it was still fun to lay on, nonetheless.

I (F) dated my ex (M) when we were in high school 15 turning 16 and he was 16 turning 17. When we dated he told me ""I've never been with a *states ethnicity*"" and idk why but I continued to stay with him. Since I grew up with very strict parents, we didn't get to hangout outside of school. Only after school, and we made out in various public parking lots. Before this moment, we had talked about me grabbing *it* and just lots of jokes. We did a lot of stuff on FaceTime too. One day, We drove to a parking lot, and got into the back seat and started making out. I asked to give him a handj*b, and he mentioned being anxious about ppl seeing us since we were near a road and I told him it's fine. We continued to make out and until he finish. Also he helped me like do the handjob because I didn't how to do. I tried to get on top of him, but he didn't want to continue so I stopped and we just scrolled through my phone gallery. When we got back to the school parking lot, he grabbed to kiss me and we started kissing until I noticed my parents were pulling up to pick me up, and I stopped him and ran out of the car. We continued to make out afterward and continued to do stuff on FaceTime, but things got relatively busy and tense between us due to school, extracurricular and me not being allowed to hang out outside of school. He broke up with me over text while he was at a ""party"" and this was weeks after begging him to even talk to me. After we broke up, he subsequently dated a close friend of mine for over a year and a half. Before we started college, he reached out to me and apologized for how he treated me and was being really encouraging. We continued to stay friends for 2 years in undergrad, going on walks and studying together until he became friends with other ppl. He told some of my friends ""idk why she's going around telling ppl we dated when we never did."" And things between us fell off pretty quickly and we haven't talked since then because I never confronted him and just distanced myself. 

I've been having episodic anxiety due to the trigger of that day I gave him a handjob and wondered if maybe I SAed him. I just feel really sick and want to close this chapter of my life. I've reached out to him recently asking to get coffee and he said ""that sounds nice,"" and that he was busy this week and next week but he stressed twice that he will let me know and we can schedule something. I'm super anxious and I don't know. I've attempted to do the ABCD therapy technique, but still feeling anxious. I used to suffer from very bad intrusive thoughts and my therapist mentioned having complex PTSD due to physical and verbal abuse I experienced growing up and lately I've been drinking redbull on top of my ADHD medication.

Over the past year or so, I’ve fallen deep into the fragrance rabbit hole. I love exploring different scent profiles, finding the perfect scent for a mood or occasion, and just appreciating fragrance as an art form. But as much as I love this hobby, I’ve had to take a step back and think realistically about how I actually wear fragrance.

I’m 42, a college professor who mostly works from home, and when I do go out, it’s usually in pretty casual settings—restaurants, coffee shops, maybe a night at the theater, but never clubs or fancy events. I rarely dress up, and I don’t work in an office, so a lineup of formal occasion fragrances doesn’t really apply to my lifestyle.

With that in mind, I’ve decided to keep my full bottle purchases to cheapies and mid-range designers—things I can spray freely and enjoy every day without worrying about price or performance anxiety. As for the really expensive niche stuff? I’ll just stick to decants and travel sprays. That way, I can still enjoy the artistry of higher-end fragrances without spending a fortune on full bottles that I’ll never get through.

This approach has kept my collection fun, practical, and guilt-free. Anyone else take a similar approach? Would love to hear how others balance their love of fragrance with their actual lifestyle!",7,1741474696.0,fragrance,1,0.89,False

Last weekend I had a first date Saturday and also Sunday. Both were texting me a ton and showing lots of interest prior to meeting. They both went decent, just fairly short coffee dates.

**Introduction**

  


**“I care for you still and I will forever” white Ferrari. -Frank Ocean.**

  


**Agnus.**

  


**Ambrose Cushing. Im so over him, it wasn’t even really love!**

 **Right?**

**Ambrose and I dated through out my three last years of school, my sophomore, junior, and senior year. he was truly my everything. I remember the day I met him like it was yesterday, I walked into high school, nervous about my freshman year, to meet the sapphire eyes of a deviously handsome boy standing by a row of lockers, talking to another boy. He smiled at me. It was our first meeting so obviously the smile was just a casual ‘hey!’, but it still melted my heart. God that perfect row of teeth, and god those perfect lips curling into the most ethereal smile I’ve ever seen. I felt my knees go weak, and that feeling lasted even after he turned away to continue talking to whoever he was talking to.**

**My first class was English. And as I made my way there, I was running. I was so late! God, first day of school and im already screwed, my curly hair somehow escaped the bun it was in, and now it was everywhere. Finally! i walked into class and my teacher, Mrs Walter, gave me a smile, I was surprised but I smiled back. And the second I turned to find a seat, two sapphire headlights lit at me. His eyes. He smiled.** ***THAT SMILE*****. I awkwardly smiled back and found a seat before I would collapse to the floor. I could feel my knees wobble. After class, he stood up and walked towards me “Ambrose Cushing, you?”. I bet he could see the hearts I had for eyes at that moment. “Ambrose…” “yeah that’s me” he smiled with a little laugh.** ***GOD I WAS MELTING*****. “Agnus Whitney..” I whispered “that’s a pretty name, I’ll see you around” I smiled widely and awkwardly, I definitely had “IM IN LOVE WITH YOU!” Written all across my now cherry red face. He suddenly turned around “your cheeks are cherry red ,*****cherry*****” he laughed and exited the class and I was left with my thoughts. CHEERY?  A NICKNAME?HE’S FOND OF ME?Calm down, creep. That nickname stuck with me though, and it’d be a lie to say I hated it.**

**and as the days passed, we grew closer, and closer, and closer, and his charm was really irresistible, and it wasn’t just his charm, it was his heart. He was the kindest boy I’ve ever met, to the point that referring to him as a ‘boy’ felt like an insult, he was a man. and you know the drill. We kissed for the first time during the summer between freshman and sophomore year, it was at my place, in the pool. ‘The way I loved you” by Taylor swift was playing in the background. It was my birthday and I had a pool party. After everyone left it was just me and Ambrose. We swam for a bit then we sat on the little cushions my mother had spread out near the pool. He turned to me as the song sang “so in love that you act insane, and that’s the way I loved you”. His lips then parted, he almost said something but then closed his lips again and smiled, he looked at the ground for a second than back at me “do you believe in young love?” He asked me, in a tone I couldn’t quite measure, because I hadn’t experienced the feeling of being spoken to in that tone yet. His words lingered in my mind, each one echoing like a question I hadn’t even realised I needed to answer., and I answered. “I guess..” He smiled “we’re so young, Cherry.” Not that nickname again. It stuck with me. “Yeah, we are” I giggled before silencing my voice in a smile “have you ever been in love, Cherry?”**

**I froze, I was about to burst and tell him I loved him, but instead I answered stupidly ‘No! Are you?’ I asked, straightening up, panic creeping into my voice. “Cherry, don’t you get it?” He laughed and looked straight into my eyes. Those two sapphire headlights that still light up in my head everyday. “Ambrose are you saying that you l-“ “I love you, Cherry.” He told me and I was so shocked I started laughing. LAUGHING. God how stupid was I? “But you- I mean we- I thought that-“ I stuttered and he brushed his thumb on my bottom lip. “It’s okay, you don’t have to talk.” He smiled gently. I felt my heart blossom. “I love you too, dummy. I thought you noticed. Every time I look at you my eyes turn into hearts. I thought you notic-“ he cut me off by pressing his lips against mine. He kissed me so gently it almost felt like he hadn’t kissed me. A thousand butterflies exploded in my tummy, and I could’ve sworn I saw stars fall from the sky. Yep, SAW. I KISSED HIM WITH WIDE OPEN EYES. The second I realised that I was kissing THE Ambrose Cushing, I wrapped my arms around his neck and wished kisses could last forever. When we pulled away he smiled “are you my girlfriend now?” ‘Of course!’ I said, grinning like a fool, before jumping into the pool and pulling him with me. ‘What kind of question is that?’. And it went on, sophomore, junior and senior year, he hadn’t even considered looking at another girl and I could bet on it. I’d watched enough rom coms to now that look in his eyes was a look of pure love. The same look that was in the eyes of my father, Warren Whitney, when he looked at my mother, Amanda Whitney. They were my idols when It came to love. They loved Ambrose. They still do, and me too, but I’ll never admit it. He broke me after all. What I’ll admit though, is that during our relationship, he was the sweetest. He’d always smile to me when wed talk, he’d always send me ‘good morning, Cherry!’ , ‘I love you!’ And ‘goodnight, Cherry. I’ll see you tomorrow.’ He was the magnet and my heart was the metal, he pulled me in. He pulled my everything in. He had my heart, soul and body. I loved him. I fucking loved him.**

**I loved him.**

**I loved Ambrose.**

**I really did.**

**I need to let go though, he broke my heart. It was the day after senior prom, he was leaving New York to go to UCLA. he wanted to study environmental engineering there, I remember how in love with environmental activism he was too, he’d always help out with the environment. I was staying in NewYork though. He kissed me and whispered in my lips “baby, long distance will ruin what we have..” I remember the tear that fell from his eye. “Baby..baby, no!” my voice cracked, you could hear the tears. And if you couldn’t hear them, you’d see the Niagara Falls falling down my cheeks and spreading all over his white polo shirt. He kissed me again, on my forehead “bye, cherry.” He then stood up and left. He left me on that park bench. I sat there, frozen, unable to shake the image of him walking away. The only part of me that was still alive was my eyes, developing and releasing the Nile river down my cheeks. My chest felt like it was caving in, as if the weight of everything we’d been through had just… disappeared. ‘Bye, Cherry.’ I kept hearing those words over and over, and I hated how much they still meant to me.I’ll never forgive him for hurting me, but I’ll also never be able to thank him enough for proving to me how real love could be. Thanks Ambrose Cushing. the following three weeks after the breakup I spent eating ice cream ad watching romantic films while I cried, but after that came the so called ‘healing’. I found it hard, because there was the good moments and bad moments, the good moments made me want to kiss him forever and the bad made me want to punch him where it hurt.  I was conflicted to say the least. Did I still love him? I mean obviously. But did I WANT to love him? Absolutely the fuck not! I talked with my therapist about it, she said it was fine to hold on to love, after all, true love is like a drug, you have it once, then twice, then its an addiction. You simply can’t let go. And the only way to move on was to find someone new, but I didn’t want too get a rebound, I was hurt enough and in absolutely no need to hurt someone else. The years passed and as a now twenty three year old, I was moved on! That’s what I told my self, but the truth is, I still love Ambrose Cushing. I could still hear our conversations when walking by the places we’ve been, I could hear the kissing sounds of us making out whenever I get in my car, I could still feel his hugs and comfort when putting a blanket over my self when I sleep. HIS blanket, which I kept after the break up for comfort. Not even my therapist can convince me to throw it away. I loved him, and he’ll always carry the piece of my heart he’d stolen with him when he’d left.**

**“I’ll never forget how stupid in love I felt” Second best. - Laufey.**

  


**Agnus.**

  


**“Fine” I handed over the twenty dollar bill to Susan and the whole table cheered “Thank you, Love” Susan laughed with a wink as she stood up and walked to the door. That day I told everyone in my group I wouldn’t be paying for lunch. It was emeralds turn to pay! But she was absent from our meeting today! So everyone came up with the conclusion that I should be paying. Instead of making everyone starve I decided to be nice and give Susan the money so she would go buy the food. i worked for my parents fashion company ‘Kismet’. Id always been in love with fashion. Anyway, I was in charge of the designing group, consisting of 7 members including me: Me, Susan, Emerald, Arthur, Juliet, Lorelai, and Leonardo.** 

**I loved them all so much , truly. Susan was the closest to me. She knew all about Ambrose, honestly my whole team knew about Ambrose. And all about my whole life. Im a big oversharer. She always encouraged me to go out and find love, but my heart refused to let go of the past. It refused to erase the name Ambrose from inside it.** 

**There I was sitting down annoyed as Susan left to get food and everyone got back to designing. I was currently working on a wedding dress. MY wedding dress. The wedding dress I swore to wear on MY wedding day. This wedding dress was also a dress I designed for kismet, my parents loved the idea too. I was sewing some roses to it, it looked absolutely ethereal.** 

**As I munched down on the last bit of a chocolate bagel “Susan, will you marry me?” I said as I swallowed the last bit of chocolaty bagel I had in my mouth ”you have the best taste in food places” I added. “Says the girl who almost let us starve twenty minutes ago.” She said with a laugh. I rolled my eyes and wiped the bagel crumbs from my face. I cleared my throat then spoke “As you all know, I’m going out to an beach cleaning organisation tomorrow with my parents, so I’ll be absent, Susans in charge.” Everyone nodded. “When emerald is here tomorrow tell her she owes me twenty bucks.” Everyone erupted into laughter which annoyed me. “I’m serious!”. “Sure, sure.’ Leonardo  laughed. A few minutes into us working on our pieces, Arthur suddenly turned off the music that was playing. “Oooh, cherry.” Arthur teased as he placed his needle and roll of threads on the table, he was working on a suit. I rolled my eyes “shut up.” I spit out.“Wedding dress for you, huh? You planning on making Ambrose your groom? Or have you decided to wait for the ‘right one’?” Arthur said, I almost turned around and smacked him across the face, everyone knew that Ambrose was a red line, talking about him would be breaking a boundary. “Excuse me? T-thats really irrelevant in my opinion..” I said after a gulp and a moment of silence that lasted about twenty four seconds.“ Also, Why would you bring him up?” I muttered, bitting my bottom lip and my hands subtly shaking. “Oh, I see.” Lorelai chimed in, her voice dripping with curiosity and something that I couldn’t quite measure. “Still not over him, huh?”**

**I didn’t know if it was the question or the tone, but I could feel my throat tighten, and my feet grow limp and weak. “I’m not—” I stopped myself before I sounded like a broken record. “It’s fine, okay? We’re all fine.”**

**“Sure you are, Agnus,” Leonardo said, raising an eyebrow. “You sure you’re fine? Because the last time I checked, you were still designing your ‘dream wedding dress.’”**

**I tried to shake it off. I was getting irritated now, the mix of my suppressed feelings and their casual probing making me feel like I was back in time, a period of my life I hated.**

**“I’m fine,” I repeated, more firmly this time. “Look, we have work to do. I need to finish this dress.”**

**For a moment, they were silent, the only sound in the room the gentle hum of the sewing machine. But I could feel the weight of their eyes on me. “ also, you guys know talking about Ambrose isn’t allowed.” I blurted out. The silence in the room thickened again.**

**Then, Leonardo broke it with a low whistle. “Agnus, you ever think about what would’ve happened if you and Ambrose stayed together?”**

**A nervous humourless chuckle escaped my lips. “We were young,” I said quickly, hoping to deflect and sound unaffected. “Things happen.”**

**“Yeah, but you two had something. You know that, right?” Arthur said, voice quieter now. “You ever think what might’ve happened if you tried again?”**

**“I told you,” I said sharply, a little too quickly. “We’re fine. And he’s fine.”my hands were shaking so much I had to put my needle down, and I bit my bottom lip in attempt to hold back the emotions. My body also tensed up, at that moment I knew that one more word from anyone would break me.. “But-“ Arthur tried to add, and that’s when I lost it all. “Change the damn topic or shut up!” I yelled . The only sounds I could hear after my ‘bursting out’ moment were the low gasps. I could only see read at that moment, I was so mad. ‘Im sorry, excuse me.” I said before throwing my sewing kit into the bag and leaving the room.** ***I rushed to the elevator, my fingers trembling as I pressed the button, willing it to hurry up. But no matter how hard I tried to focus on the task at hand, my mind kept drifting back to the words that had been said just moments ago.***

***""Still not over him, huh?""***

***The tightness in my chest worsened. It felt like my ribs were being crushed under the weight of everything I had tried to bury. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think. My feet moved faster than my mind, and before I knew it, I was racing down the stairs, skipping two steps at a time. The thudding of my shoes against the marble echoed in the empty stairwell, each beat a reminder of how much I was running away from.***

***I signed out at the receptionist desk, barely glancing at the polite smile on her face. My heart pounded, blood rushing in my ears. The door swung open, and I almost stumbled outside, desperate to escape. The cold air hit me, sharp and unforgiving, but I barely noticed as I made my way to the car.***

***I slammed the door shut and leaned forward, pressing my forehead to the steering wheel. My hands gripped the wheel tightly, and before I could stop myself, the tears started to flow. One drop, then two, and then a river that couldn’t be stopped.*** **The cold leather of the steering wheel felt like ice beneath my fingers, a stark contrast to the heat of the tears running down my face.** ***I cried for the girl who once had it all, for the girl who believed that love could fix everything, for the girl who was still so painfully in love with him.***

***“How can I hate you so bad, yet I love you the most, Ambrose?”***

***My voice barely escaped, a soft whisper that came out of my tight throat, I almost chocked on it.***

***I drove home in silence, every red light turning sapphire when I looked at it, a cruel reminder of those eyes that stared into mine for hours. And when I finally reached my apartment, I didn’t bother to check my buzzing phone. I knew it was Susan, but I couldn’t talk to her right now. Not while I was drowning in this feeling. The feeling that I myself couldn’t name. The feeling that always tightened my throat and turned my eyes into waterfalls. The feeling I always got when talking about a certain someone. A certain Ambrose Cushing.*** **I should hate him by now, right? I should be over this... over him. But I’m not, and every day it eats away at me. Maybe that’s why I can't stop crying. Maybe that’s why I can’t let him go.**

***I threw my keys on the counter, my purse on the couch and I took off my miumiu heels, before collapsing onto my bed, staring at the ceiling. And in that moment, the soft glow of the lights above me turned into those sapphire headlights. I shut my eyes and let the floodgates open again. I didn’t want to miss him. But I couldn’t stop.***

***Stupid. Naive. Hopeless romantic.***

***Those are words to describe me. At this point, I can’t even go a day without seeing sapphire everywhere, I need to have one last battle with my feelings, I’ll either beta them or they’ll beat me. But no matter the outcome I’ll be satisfied, because it’ll finally mean I moved on.***

***Suddenly the floodgates shut close, and there were no more tears to cry. But I felt…*****I felt empty—completely drained, like I had no more tears left to cry, no more energy to fight. All I wanted was silence. I sat there in silence, opening my eyes every few seconds to look at the sapphire headlights my soft lights had turned into, the shutting them close at the stinging reminder of what I’d lost. Every time I see those headlights, it’s like time stands still. Like the world narrows down to that one moment—his eyes, his laugh, his scent... all of it. Sapphire. That’s what I see, no matter where I look. His memory is a ghost, haunting me at every turn. For a second after that I felt peace, the second phase of this feeling, but it never lasted long, because then the thoughts occupied my brain. Phase three of this feeling: occupation of thoughts. What if I let him back in, only for him to break me all over again? What if I'm not strong enough to survive that? But what if I never give him the chance... what if I lose him forever? God, give me a break. I need to battle my feelings.**

**The battle isn't just with my feelings for Ambrose—it's with myself. I can either keep running from the truth or finally face it head-on. Maybe that’s the only way I’ll ever move on, or maybe it’ll be the thing that brings us back together. But I can’t keep living in the past. Not anymore.**

**“I’ll love you till the day that I die” birds of a feather. - billie eilish.**

  


**Ambrose.**

  


**I grabbed my keys, my fingers trembling slightly as I fumbled to fit them into my hand. My heart was already racing. I was late—again. I was always late to the beach-cleaning events I organized, but today felt different. It wasn’t just another event. The ocean, the cause, the people—it all mattered so much more this time. There were lives to change, pollution to fight, a mission to push forward. I couldn’t afford to mess this up.**  
**Slamming the door of my car shut, I quickly started the engine, the hum of the motor filling the silence. I backed out of the driveway, my eyes scanning the street, my thoughts scattered. Then, as I was shifting from reverse to drive, I caught a glimpse of her—a woman getting into a sage-green Fiat 500 parked nearby.**  
**For a split second, my heart skipped a beat. I didn’t have time to register much, but I knew the feeling that hit me was more than just a passing recognition. Something about the way she moved, the grace in her posture, was so familiar. A pang of something—longing, regret, a soft ache—flooded my chest, and I felt it deep in my bones.**  
**But I couldn’t think about her now. Focus, Ambrose. I shifted gears again, my hands gripping the wheel a little too tightly, trying to push the thought out of my head. It didn’t work. I was already lost in the echoes of that brief moment. Who was she? Why did her face haunt me even in the few seconds I had seen her?**  
**I flicked the radio on to drown out the rising unease in my chest. But then the red light hit, and I had to stop. The radio blared to life with a song that felt like a punch to my gut—*****The Way I Loved You*** **by Taylor Swift.**  
**The opening guitar riff hit hard, and I immediately felt the breath leave my lungs.** ***No, not this song*****, I thought.** ***Not now.***  
**But it was too late. The lyrics echoed through my car, and my heart twisted. Every word felt like it was written just for me. The voice. The memories. The rawness of it all.**  
**I reached for the volume knob to turn it down, but my hand stopped midair. I couldn’t do it. I couldn't silence the song. I couldn't escape the memories. The melody wrapped around me like a shackle, pulling me deeper into the past. Every lyric seemed to reach into the darkest parts of me, dragging everything I’d tried so hard to forget back to the surface.**  
**It was her. Agnus.** ***Cherry*****.**  
**The name came to me like a whisper, so soft but so heavy. I still remembered the way she would light up every time I said it, her whole face changing, a spark igniting in her eyes like I was the only one who truly knew her. God, how I missed that.**  
**I missed everything about her. The way her honey-brown eyes sparkled when she laughed. The soft curls that tumbled around her face, framing her gentle features. Her little quirks—the way she always had a stray piece of hair falling into her eyes, how she’d tuck it behind her ear absentmindedly while she talked. Her laugh that always seemed to fill the room, soft and melodious like the sound of a melody no one else could hear. I missed her love for cats, the way she’d tell me about them with so much enthusiasm, her soft voice almost singing their names.**  
**And I missed her stories. I missed hearing about her day—the way she’d get excited about the little things, even the mundane. How she would tell me about the coffee she had that morning or the book she was reading. Everything felt significant when she said it, as if the world was unfolding in front of me through her eyes.**  
**But I walked away. I left her. I left her.**  
**It didn’t matter that I thought I was doing the right thing. I could have stayed. I should have stayed. But the fear… God, the fear had been too much. The distance, the uncertainty, the feeling of everything slipping away. It made my chest tighten just thinking about it. I was scared of falling apart. Scared of losing her. So I pushed her away instead. I told myself it was for the best. Long-distance would ruin everything. We were on different paths. She had her life, I had mine.**  
**But I was lying. The distance didn’t ruin us.** ***I*** **did.**  
**I couldn’t stand the thought of being alone again, but at least I’d have my heart intact, right? That’s what I told myself. I wasn’t strong enough to trust in what we had. I wasn’t strong enough to fight for it.**  
**The radio blared again, and I realized I was still gripping the dial. I forced myself to release it, but the echoes of the song stayed with me, their words winding through my thoughts like a slow poison. I could still feel her touch, still remember the way her skin felt against mine.**  
**As I turned onto the main road, the image of the woman getting into the Fiat resurfaced. That face. The way her hair cascaded over her shoulders, the way she moved. Could it be her? Was I imagining things?**  
**No. Focus.** ***This is not about her. It’s not about your past.***  
**But that thought was hollow. Empty. I had spent so much of my life trying to run from the past, trying to convince myself that I had made the right choices. But every day, every minute that passed, the truth sank deeper into me. I hadn’t made the right choice. I had pushed her away, and the regret sat like a weight in my chest, heavy and unrelenting.**  
**I reached the event site, and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore didn’t bring me the peace it should have. The salty air filled my lungs, but it didn’t cleanse me. Nothing could cleanse me. Not the sea, not the sand beneath my feet, not the fresh breeze. Nothing could wash away the ache of missing her. Nothing could erase the way she used to smile at me like I was everything. Like I was the one.**  
**As I parked the car and stepped out, my shoes sank into the soft sand, the grains sticking to my feet. I felt the cool breeze whip through my hair, but it was just a reminder of how much I couldn’t escape the past.**  
**Every day, I told myself that time would heal everything, that the guilt would fade, but it never did. No matter how much I tried to move on, to focus on the future, my heart kept wandering back to her.**  
**She was out there, somewhere. Maybe even at this very event, maybe somewhere close, maybe not. But the thought that I might see her again? That thought haunted me.**  
**I took a deep breath and forced myself to focus on the task at hand. But the ache was still there, gnawing at the edges of my thoughts. The event was supposed to be my escape, a way to do something meaningful, to make a difference in the world. But all I could think about was her.**  
**I stepped forward, pushing all the memories down, trying to focus. But Agnus... Cherry... she was everywhere, lingering like the scent of the ocean on the breeze.**  
**I caught up with everyone, and we got in a circle to start discussing the areas to clean for the day and to make teams.**  
**As everyone made a circle, my world suddenly hit the pause button.**  
**Those eyes, those lips, those brows, those lashes, those curls…**  
***Cherry.***  
**I looked up, blinking rapidly as the fog lifted, and there she was.**  
**Agnus.**  
**It was impossible. She couldn’t be here. I hadn't seen her in years—*****years*****. And yet, there she was, standing a few feet away, her eyes meeting mine, as though nothing had changed. As if no time had passed.**  
**For a moment, my legs felt like they were frozen in place. The air around me thickened, and I couldn’t find my breath. I wanted to speak, to call her name, to run toward her, but my body refused to move. My heart thundered in my chest, racing in a way it hadn't in a long time.**  
***How is she here?***  
**I stood motionless, locked in place by her presence, by the flood of memories crashing over me. The sight of her—her face, her smile, the way she looked at me like I was her world—it shattered every wall I had built.**  
**I was still staring, unable to tear my gaze away when she finally smiled, that familiar warmth in her expression, the one I had missed so much. But it wasn’t the smile I remembered. It was different, more guarded, like she had changed. And then she looked down, breaking eye contact, her shoulders tightening.**  
**My throat went dry. She looked... distant. Was she disappointed to see me? Angry? I couldn’t tell. But the pain was so sharp, I could hardly breathe.**  
**And that was it. I was drowning in a sea of emotions, my chest heavy with regret and fear, while she stood before me, unchanged yet so different, like we were strangers who used to be so much more.**

  


  


***Three.***

  


***“Think I’ll miss you forever, like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky.”***

***Summertime sadness. -Lana Del Ray.***

  


***Agnus.***

  


**I woke up that morning tangled in a mess of sheets and wet with tears. The kind of tears you can’t stop even when you don’t want to cry anymore. I blinked into the early morning light, my eyes swollen and puffy, my body ached like it had been physically torn apart. It felt like the whole world had shifted on its axis while I slept, and I was the only one who hadn’t been prepared for the shift.** 

**I threw the covers off and forced myself out of bed, standing up slowly, as if moving too quickly might shatter something fragile inside me. The day had to go on. I couldn’t afford to keep drowning in this sadness. Not today. I needed to focus on something. On anything. So I forced my body through the motions, pulling on some clothes, washing my face, making coffee, and eating breakfast in a numb haze.**

**Grabbing my keys and purse, I stepped out of my apartment, into the cool air of the morning. My sage-green Fiat 500 sat waiting for me in the parking lot, its sleek little shape oddly comforting—one of the few constants in my life. I had to rush to my parents’ house. They were expecting me to drive them to the beach-cleaning event I had reluctantly agreed to attend. My parents always seemed so full of life, so wrapped up in the world around them. I often wondered how they didn’t carry the same weight I did, the same ache that I couldn’t shake, no matter how hard I tried.**

**The drive to their house felt like a blur, my mind still locked in the fog of last night’s dreams, replaying the scenes of my past with him, the way his laugh used to feel against my skin, the warmth of his touch, the light in his eyes when he would say my name—*****Cherry*****. Everything about him lingered, like a scent I couldn’t scrub off.**

**When I pulled up to their house, they were already waiting, smiles on their faces as I climbed out of the car. I forced a smile back, trying to seem like I wasn’t running away from my own thoughts. The drive to the event was quiet, my parents chatting easily about their plans for the summer, but I couldn’t focus. My mind kept slipping back to him. How could I have let it all go? Why had I let him slip through my fingers like sand? It was so easy to tell myself it was for the best. So easy to believe that it was better this way. But the truth kept gnawing at me, even now.**

**When we arrived at the event, the air was salty, fresh, and brisk. I could feel the cool ocean breeze against my skin as I stepped out of the car. I could already hear the excited voices of the volunteers, the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. It should have been a peaceful scene, but I felt like an outsider. I didn’t belong here. I didn’t belong anywhere.**

**I walked over to where the others were gathered, trying to push the weight of my thoughts aside and focus on the task at hand. Everyone was talking about where they’d be cleaning up, making teams, laughing. I tried to join in, but it felt like everything around me was moving too fast, too easily, while I was stuck in slow motion. I barely registered the sound of the organizer’s voice when he called for everyone to form a circle, to start the event.**

**And then, just like that, everything stopped.**  
**Time froze.**  
**The world around me ceased to exist.**  
**The waves quieted. The sun’s heat felt dimmer.**  
**Because there, standing across from me, was** ***Ambrose*****.**

**I don’t know how long we stared at each other. His eyes were locked onto mine with an intensity that felt like he was trying to reach inside me, like he could see the parts of me I’d hidden away, the parts I thought were long buried. I felt that familiar pull again, that tug in my chest, the way my heart used to race when he was near. I thought I had buried it, buried him. But he was here, in front of me, and everything I had tried to forget came rushing back in a tidal wave.**

**My breath hitched. I could feel the tears threatening, clawing at my throat. The knot in my stomach tightened, and I had to look away before I broke down in front of everyone. I didn’t want them to see. I didn’t want anyone to know how much he still affected me.**

**I gave him a weak, feeble smile, a forced thing that barely touched my lips, and looked down at the ground to hide the tears in my eyes. I bit my lip so hard I could taste the salt of my own skin, trying to stop the flood that was building up behind my eyes. I couldn’t cry here. Not now. Not in front of everyone. But my chest hurt so much, the pressure too much to bear.**

**How was he here? Why did it feel like nothing had changed?**  
**Had he missed me too, or was I the only one who couldn’t move on?**

**The organizer clapped his hands, breaking the spell. People around us began to chatter, and slowly, the circle began to form, but I felt rooted to the spot, like the earth itself refused to let me move. I tried to take a deep breath, but my chest was tight.**

**Just as I was about to turn away, I heard his voice, low and rough, like he’d been holding back too.**

**“Agnus,” he said, his voice soft but piercing through the noise.**

**I froze, my heart pounding. I knew it was him, but hearing my name from his lips was like being hit by a wave. I couldn’t stop myself from turning to face him, even though I knew it would hurt.**

**“What are you doing here?” he asked, his eyes searching mine.**

**“I’m just here to help.” The words felt hollow in my mouth, like I was lying to him, to myself.**

**He nodded. “Didn’t think I’d see you at something like this.”**

**“I wasn’t sure either.” I glanced toward the ocean for a moment. “I wasn’t sure about a lot of things.”**

**“Yeah. Same here,” he said, adjusting his stance, as though unsure of how to stand or what to say. “It’s... good to see you again.”**

**I nodded, though the words felt empty. ""Yeah.""**

**There was a beat of silence between us. Then he looked away, focusing on the people forming the circle.**

**""You’ve been doing well?"" he asked, though it felt more like a formality than a real question.**

**""I’m okay,"" I answered simply. ""Just... here for this.""**

**Another pause. I could feel the weight of his eyes on me, but I kept my gaze straight ahead, avoiding meeting them for too long. The noise around us felt muffled, like we were in a bubble of our own.**

**“I guess we should probably get in the circle before they start without us,” he said, gesturing toward the group.**

**“Yeah, probably,” I replied, stepping forward, keeping a careful distance.**

**We joined the circle, the conversation shifting to the task at hand. But as we stood there, I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was so much left unsaid. So much between us that had never been addressed.**

1j6t7ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1j6t7ba/day_1/,Day 1,"A little background. I have OCD since I was a child. I also have binge eating disorder. I am 5’3. The highest I weighed was 275 in July of 2023. I was fed up and just logged my calories every day and dropped down to 150 by September of 2024. I have young kids and don’t want to die prematurely.  Just ate clean, weighed my food, and logged every single day. That was it. With losing weight, I naturally moved and excercised more. I felt great. Started hiking. Started using my peloton. Played with the kids more. I felt in control. 

October came and I messed up. And kept messing up. I stopped logging. I work in healthcare and with a new, stressful job I lost control. I had no time to log. No time to meal prep. And now I am 190. Needing to put the brakes down fast I started zepbound yesterday.  I am disappointed that I have to resort to it. I have the insight to know why I need it, but I just wish I could have done this without help.

Today, I woke up not hungry. The first time since September. I am someone who obsesses over food. I cooked for my family without the urge or care to pick on the meal myself while cooking. This is not a placebo effect. This is years of behaviors and obsessions that I have had since childhood and they are gone in 24 hours. 

Made my coffee like I have been making it for the last 20 years and it tastes weird.  Bland. Almost chemically or salty.  I am not hungry, but made myself a small lunch. It tasted off. I covid tested myself thinking maybe I am getting sick and that’s why it all tastes odd. It just doesn’t taste good. I don’t understand. My Covid test was negative.  

I am just in absolute shock.  It is just so freeing. ",6,1741474128.0,Zepbound,2,0.8,False
1j6t674,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGirls/comments/1j6t674/how_do_i_make_sure_im_not_going_after_someone_in/,How do I make sure I’m not going after someone in a relationship?,"I’m 26M and taking a class with 23F, let’s call her Olivia. In the first lecture, came up to the first row where I was sitting and started talking to me. Since that lecture, we have always sat together, and always chatted a bit in the beginning.
A couple of weeks ago, I asked her out for coffee and she instantly said yes, checked her work schedule and told me what works for her. It worked out perfectly because one of the times was right after an exam that I had, so I was going to be free after that.
Long story short: it went great. We had great chemistry, conversation flowed smoothly, no awkward gaps at all, and she teased me relentlessly but in good spirits.
Now here’s my anxiety speaking (most likely) from a past experience. One of my former best friends (25F) didn’t tell me for years that she was dating someone. She was a bit flirty with me at times, and she knew I had eventually started to get feelings for her. When I finally got the guts to tell her, she said she already knew somewhat that I liked her but she had been dating someone for years, and the reason she didn’t tell me was to “not hurt my feelings”. Some of the things she did, like flirting etc., I would never have engaged or flirted back, out of respect for her and her boyfriend. 
This was only a few months ago, so the anxiety from that is still there a little bit. Now with the energy Olivia is giving, it feels like a sharp reminder of that friend. Now I have no reason to believe she is seeing someone, except my anxiety. What is the best approach here, to take things in a respectful direction, but also to guard my own boundaries with someone in a relationship?",2,1741474040.0,AskGirls,3,1.0,False
