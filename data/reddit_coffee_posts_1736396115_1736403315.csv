As the title indicates I‚Äôm an MBB consultant based in Europe (started as an associate and promoted to manager so been at the organisation for 4 years) I work in life science, biotech and global health work. 

I have 2 engineering undergrads in biomedical engineering (top 25% - 100 applicants, 25 accepted and 9 passed) and electrical (honours award) engineering, from the best schools in South Africa, and an MBA from Oxford (graduated as a scholar). At Oxford I rowed for my college and was a director of the VC arm of the university (highly selective ~ 300 applications for 10 slots)

Before the MBA and MBB I worked for a healthcare startup building dialysis centres in east africa, worked for a Gates foundation organization helping coffee farmers build better business and a stint in consulting and PE.

Rec letters are from two managing partners and one Oxford professor - and I believe they are good. SOP is good too I think. 

I graduated biomed eng in 2012, electrical eng in 2014 and Oxford in 2020. Oxford grades are decent but engineering are average (through they went up between my two degrees). I am an African national. 

I‚Äôm applying to masters programs only: Penn and Stanford bioengineering and Penn biotech program. I do not want to pursue a PhD and will go back to consulting or investing after - my aim with the programs is to deepen my technical knowledge. Also I will fully self fund the program I get into.

She shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to procreate!!! Ffs Her mothering skills are subpar!! She‚Äôs the one who needs mothering!!!!!!

I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs evil like Dave but she‚Äôs just so annoying because she‚Äôs so slow. Like she gives off slow brain vibes and acts a lot on her emotions.

Good thing about her is that she can take accountability for her actions but everything else is a shit show with Susan.

I really really hate how she 1) put herself in between Mike and Katherine! it really isn‚Äôt in her place! She‚Äôs so immature for doing this!!! And to top it off, she‚Äôs the one who divorced Mike!! wtf!!

What really pissed me off was the episode about Katherine‚Äôs pearls. What the fuck was that. What sense of entitlement can a person have to be able to pull off whatever the fuck Susan pulled off. To put Mike in a situation like that was absolutely fucking ridiculous. If I was in Katherine‚Äôs shoes I would seriously throw coffee at Susan‚Äôs face. Like how fucking dare she. She had no right to do that.

Lastly, the painting. What the fuck was that. Who gave her the right to even snoop around Katherine‚Äôs stuff. What the hell was that entire bs.

Gosh I had to get that off my chest. Susan is ridiculous. For those who have watched Gilmore girls, she reminds me of lorelai. Childish and insensitive. Acts on her emotions and does not have the slightest ounce grace or tact. No one asked but I wouldn‚Äôt be friends with Susan in real life. She‚Äôd just piss me off too much.

1hx5wn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/1hx5wn5/liz_flores_tasting_menu_at_esm√©_january_2025/,Liz Flores tasting menu at Esm√© (January 2025).,"I went for the full tasting menu at Esm√© inspired by the artwork of Liz Flores, a local Chicago artist. It was an unexpected delight. **9.25/10 overall.**

**Food - 9.** I'd seen a lot of mixed reviews about this restaurant, so I wasn't sure how this was all going to go. Fortunately, my worries were unfounded, and I was kind of blown away by the exquisite technical mastery behind many of these dishes. Most courses were an absolutely perfect balance of flavor, texture, and temperature, often in surprising ways. There were no major misses for me despite some unusual combinations, though I certainly enjoyed some bites more than others. The partridge baked in clay was a revelation. I tried both supplements and would highly recommend the mother of pearl caviar, but not the truffle baba au rhum (unless you like a *lot* of truffle). My ugly photos do zero justice to the intriguing presentation of each course or the fascinating array of tableware. (I normally chuckle when food is served on things that really shouldn't be plates, but I have no complaints here since it was all functional, easy to eat from, and complemented the artist's work.)

**Drinks - 9.** The drinks were a hit for me too. The complimentary welcome cocktail was effervescent and pleasantly complex. I also ordered their version of a gin and tonic, which was crisp and refreshing with notes of citrus from lemon verbena and satsuma. Both beverages were hefty but not overly alcoholic.

**Service - 10.** This is what made the experience truly special. The chefs and staff presented each dish with such dramatic flair - it made for a very entertaining, enjoyable evening as I never knew what to expect but spent the whole time looking forward to whatever they'd serve next. I was there for 2.5 hours but the time flew by. The hospitality was exceptional and everyone was warm, friendly, and incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about sharing the stories behind different aspects of the experience. They even (very, very kindly) offered me one of the supplements on the house just because they wanted me to try it.

**Ambiance - 9.** I love the concept of the restaurant, which partners with local artists to highlight their work and support their community. The space itself is an interesting combination of an art gallery, open kitchen, dining room, and cozy bar. The evening began in the entryway gallery at some high-top tables with a cocktail and amuse-bouche. We were encouraged to wander around and explore freely as the staff prepared our table, so I happily did so and had fun examining the artwork and peering into the kitchen and Bar Esm√© next door. The decor seems intentionally simple so as to not distract from the featured artist's work. The chairs look horribly uncomfortable but were thankfully fine. Everything was bright, airy, and sparkling clean. Even the little towels they wiped the table with between courses smelled amazing.

**Would I go again?** Honestly, before going, I thought this menu was pretty expensive compared to similar Michelin-starred restaurants. But I get it now that I've experienced it firsthand. From the impeccable culinary technique and tableside showmanship to the bespoke artwork and artisanal plateware, it's clear that tons of hard work and passion go into each collaborative menu. To me, this is more of a visual feast than a fancy dinner - which admittedly isn't going to be everybody's cup of tea. And yes, I would go back.

**Note:** One of the complaints I frequently saw pop up in reviews was lack of price transparency. I personally didn't have that issue. A 22% service charge (including tip) was disclosed and applied upfront when I booked the reservation. It's also called out in a line item on the bill for any additional purchases at the restaurant, though there's still space to leave an additional tip if desired. I was also shown a separate menu onsite which clearly showed the cost of beverage pairings, individual drinks, and supplemental courses before I made any selections.

Well done if you've made it this far through my extremely long-winded review. And now for photographs. Apologies for my even-worse-than-usual pictures, which utterly fail to capture the magic of the entire presentation. They just depict the final result.

Today marks 9 days since we broke up, 4 days since we last spoke, and 2 days since the last time I cried. I am hurting so deeply, but I am moving forward, even if it is just through sheer determination. Today is the first day that I have felt okay. I wish I could tell you that. 

I wish I could tell you that I am choosing to care for myself in such an intense way that I am lost in it. I went through today with tunnel vision on things that make me feel like me. I got a coffee with a friend that I have never spent alone time with before, and it was filled with such beautiful conversations. I was actively engaged in all of my classes, able to focus again, and I even ate a meal at lunch time. Today is the first day that I have been able to eat for enjoyment and not survival. I engaged with my art form, my music, in a way that I haven't felt able to do in months, and I channeled the full intensity of these emotions into it. It was so beautiful, and I know you would be so proud to hear that. You fell in love with me because of my passion. I made the spontaneous decision to turn around from my commute home and go to a pilates class instead, something I haven't done since before our relationship. You always tried to help me heal my relationship with exercise. I picked out a bunch of healthy recipes to cook this week, and I bought all the ingredients. I wish I could tell you that; you were always so willing to adapt and eat better right alongside me. I listened to thoughtful podcasts on topics we used to discuss, and I took extensive notes about them. I wish I could discuss them with you and pick apart the nuances of any given topic for hours on end.

I had my first good day without you, and I wish I could tell you about it. 

It is the end of the day, and I sit writing this in my completely redone bedroom. The old one was too full of memories of you. Funny how that works; even my own space became yours. I sit alone, and I sit in my bed that can now stay in the corner of the room because it sleeps one instead of two. My room should feel good; it is filled with soft lights, a very nice candle, a cup of tea on my nightstand, uplifting music, my beautiful cat, and decorations that feel like *me*. But it does not have you. I experienced all of these good things today, and for the first time in a very long time, I did not have you to celebrate them with me.

One day, that will be okay. One day, I will experience good days not to prove that I can, but because I have built a life filled with good days that exist purely for me. I will exist in a joy that is so abundant that I am overwhelmed with it, and I will do that without needing someone by my side.

1hx5u6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Baking/comments/1hx5u6p/adapting_a_japanese_souffl√©_cheesecake_recipe/,Adapting a Japanese Souffl√© Cheesecake recipe,"I found a recipe that I think would work best (I found two recipes I believe would be solid actually) and I wanted to ask if adapting a JSC (Japanese souffl√© cheesecake) would be pretty forgiving. 

For reference this is the recipe:
By Patissier Masayoshi Ishikawa (on YT) 
cm(6inch) 1round
Cream cheese 200g
Butter 20g
Milk 50g
Egg yolk 50g
Cake flour 40g (or plain flour),[not all purpose flour, self-rising flour]
Egg white 110g
Sugar 55g


If I were to use his recipe and alter it to have a lemon flavor would the zest of a whole lemon give a subtle but noticeable lemon flavored JSC or would I also need to add lemon juice? The same question would be for turning the recipe into a chocolate souffl√©, could I add solely cocoa powder and instant coffee powder without compromising the texture of the cheesecake? 

I guess what I'm also asking is, what would I need to look out for when adapting this recipe to change flavors or incorporating add-ins? 

Thank you for any and all help.

I had a lot of sensitivity after the temporary crown was put on and the dentist suggested to only temporarily attach my permanent crowns to see of the sensitivity got better...if not he wants to do two root canals...

Obviously, I do not want the root canals. The sensitivity is better but not gone. When I chew on the crowns, it's still sensitive.

Is it normal for crowns to be sensitive...especially when they're just attached with temporary bonding/glue? 

Should I let them permanently attach the crowns and see if the permanent cement help with the sensitivity, or should I get the root canals...

Worth noting I had no pain before the crowns. 

I generally have good oral hygiene, brush two to three times a day, floss, water-pick, mouth wash and tongue scrape, etc

Dialing in espresso might feel like a science experiment, but it‚Äôs the key to unlocking your coffee‚Äôs true potential. Here‚Äôs how I approach it with the DF64 Gen 2:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Find Your Ideal Dose: Start with a standard (like 18g), but let your coffee and taste guide you. Some beans shine at 16g; others might love 20g. Test it out!

2Ô∏è‚É£ Weigh Your Beans: Never eyeball! Consistency is everything in espresso. Always weigh your beans for repeatable results‚Äîthis is non-negotiable.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Start Coarse, Adjust Gradually: Always start on the coarser side and dial in finer based on taste. Here‚Äôs a quick guide:
	‚Ä¢	Underextracted Shot: Sour, weak, or watery? Grind finer.
	‚Ä¢	Overextracted Shot: Bitter, dry, or harsh? Grind coarser.

This method helps avoid frustration and wasted beans, and it‚Äôs surprisingly rewarding when you pull that perfect shot with balanced sweetness, acidity, and body.

-electrolytes (using body armor) 
-sublingual B12



I‚Äôve had a couple sips of black coffee but I cant never drink it all.  Also I‚Äôve had sparkling water on a Champagne glass at dinner to cheer myself up.

I did not weigh myself until this afternoon on day 8, and realized I lost 12lbs, probably most of it water but lots of belly fat.

I've had quite a few experiences in my 34 years ranging from military experiences to homelessness, maybe I'll get into those later, depending on how this goes. The events I'm about to recount happened this very evening. Here goes:

I'm the assistant manager at a gas station in a city adjacent to the one I live in. It's not the most luxurious job, but it pays decent, the GM is my wife's aunt, and we have a really good rapport. Tonight, I'm working with one other person, whom I'll refer to as ""R"". As I'm pulling in to get clocked in for the night, I'm passed by one of the other employees on her way out, who flags me down to warn me of a couple fighting in the parking lot and made me aware that it seems to be escalating. ""Great"", I say sarcastically, ""I'll keep an eye on things"" and then she pulls away. I park, bid my wife a good evening and head inside. I should mention that, the car the couple are arguing around is parked at almost a perfect 45¬∞ angle across 2 parking spaces.

I get out, head inside and ask R, ""What's going on out there?"". He explains that the man pulled up in the car all crooked, apparently to come get his wife from the gas station and she begins talking at him assertively and, at this point, nobody knows what is being said, as we're just watching through the windows. The man then exits the car and stumbles into the store, clearly impaired and begins asking for sandwiches. I pointed to the case of old breakfast sandwiches that had yet to be removed and informed him that that was the extent of our sandwich supply and that it was probably best if he went to the literal sandwich shop next door for a fresher sandwich. He gives me a fist bump, tells me I'm ""real"" and proceeds to ask if we have sandwiches... I again tell him, ""Yes, but those are old and expensive, so you probably shouldn't waste your money on it"". He fist bumps me again and asks if we have coffee. I said, ""Of course"" and began showing him the coffee machines and dispensers for sugar and cream. 

This is when he decides to tell me that he's a multi-millionaire and asks if I believe him. I reply, ""no"", and he looks at me surprised. ""You don't believe me? Come here for a sec"" and he begins leading me to the front door. I'm hesitant because I don't know what this man is about to show me, but there's a cop getting gas at a nearby pump, so I step out, but not off of the paved entry way. He opens the passenger door and drunkenly slurs to his wife to tell me if he's a multi-millionaire and she confirms it, looking exhausted but not like she's amusing him. He really is a multi-millionaire. So we step back inside, begin chit-chatting about how he got that rich and he begins telling me a fragmented version of his life story. How he was in the ""retard"" class (his words) and now he's in real estate and just repeats this in different versions, all while intermittently telling R how much of a rebel he is because he has long hair and a beard. It was getting weird, so R slinked out the front door while I distracted the drunken old millionaire and flagged down the cop.

The cop calls backup and, when it arrives, pulls up, gets out of his car and comes in to ask the man to step out and talk. We're watching through the window as the conversation proceeds and another cop walks up. In a split second, the man was resisting arrest and being thrown to the ground by the skinniest cop I've ever seen. The millionaire was a pretty big guy and smash drunk, so he puts up quite a fight and ends up with a bloody nose in the struggle and injures one of the officers. Eventually they get him cuffed, takes his wife's statement, request camera footage and take their leave. If I can get ahold of the arrest footage, I'll post it, but yeah... what an exciting start to the day.",2,1736399395.0,LetsReadOfficial,2,0.75,False

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/Q06pN42Bur): **May 10, 2024**

I (41M) have two kids with my ex wife, (42F) a son John(22) and daughter Sally (20), I'm remarried to my wife (28). I'm very close with my kids, my son is engaged to Abbie, she seems nice but has been a bit pushy trying to create relationships with me and my wife, though she's also awkward with her. Abbie isn't close to her family, she told us many stories why and while some of her complaints don't seem awful, it's not my place to judge and I didn't live it so I can't know anyway.

We've tried to be welcoming but Abbie has forced her way into some family traditions where she wouldn't have been invited, and some where no one outside of specific family would have. She has been calling Sally ""sis"" since they were only dating a few months, has an odd sister/mother-in-law thing she does with my wife, and the one I'm not a fan of, wants me to be like father to her. Not because we've clicked or anything. We are very different people, not saying that in a bad way, just saying it's not based on how we get along or anything.

My kids and I have a tradition when they come over that we have a private catch-up in my office/study before they leave, which is now even more important to them because while they both get along well with my wife they don't want to have personal conversations around her yet. Abbie asked if we could talk, and after I explained the tradition John later asked that I do it, saying she'd never had a caring conversation with her dad. 

We compromised that I didn't include her in the tradition but do join the two of them for coffee and let her talk. Then she started calling me dad, they werent even engaged yet, John pulled me aside and begged me to give her that, laid this whole thing on me about me always being the dad she always wanted right in front of her and she just wanted that, told me she cried watching me and Sally together (she still gives me random hugs, I'm a lucky dad). I didn't like it but I do feel bad so fine I gave her that. She wants me to walk her down the aisle and the father/daughter dance. I don't want to walk her down, and I walk with a cane so dancing is hard. At my own wedding I only danced twice. John is begging for me to do one, preferably the aisle.

They came over Sunday, John and I were talking, I thought to address it, when Ab walked in without knocking, asking if he'd told me yet. I asked what, John said she wanted me to say something about having a second daughter now in my speech and how I loved her. I just looked at him. She asked if I'd do the walk and dance for Sally, I said of course. She yelled she's my daughter too and I said it will never be the same, Sally is my actual daughter. I tried to explain I'd talk about her being a happy addition to the family and I love how happy she makes Jack, which i thought was a good compromise, but she started crying. John apologized and they left, but he called me when they were home nearly begging me to. AITA because I won't lie and say I love her or she's my daughter.

**Verdict: Not the Asshole**

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/cU032DTxqi): **June 26, 2024 (1.5 months later)**

I had planned on writing this sooner but life got in the way in a couple of really good ways, but people were helpful and asked for updates, and I have a surprise free day, so here it goes:

Mother's Day my kids and their partners go to visit my ex wife. So it turns out my ex wife and Abbie are a lot closer than I realized. She calls her mom, which is part of where this comes from. Also apparently my ex has been egging it on. On mother's day they were talking about the wedding and I guess whenever Abbie referred to me it was as dad. My son apparently told her let it go, which led to yelling. 

Abbie about deserving to be my daughter, ex telling her that she's right, son telling her that I am trying and she should be realistic about things, Sally telling her I only had one daughter - which was apparently a response to Abbie saying to her that as my ""daughters"" they should be united. according to my son Abbi was crying, according to Sally she was crying ang yelling and kicked something before going to her room, and Sally told me she went off on her mom, but will not elaborate so I don't know what was actually said. But knowing Sally - whoo boy.

Around 2am I got a text from Sally's partner's phone saying ""Abbie really is great, she hasn't been perfect but you should give her a chance and you will learn to love her."" I saw it when I woke up I tried to text her back but was blocked, so I called Sally but they were driving. They stopped by my place later that day because I am on the way and my daughter prefers my liquor and cooking and they told me about the night before. 

At the end I asked to speak to her partner alone, I asked if I had done something to upset her. She was confused and I told her I was blocked. She said I wasn't but checked her phone and I was, and I said it was after her message and she asked what message. I showed her, it was not on her phone anymore. At that point we brought in Sally and caught her up, neither of them were happy.

A couple of days later John and Abbie dropped by unannounced; not something we really do in this family but ok fine, I had mad salmon, does not take long to cook. I cook 2 more, wife serves while I make drinks. The entire night was Abbie trying to bring up the wedding, John trying to change the subject, Abbie not allowing that. 

We talk logistics because I am helping them get some good deals through some professional contacts I have when finally she just says ""so I was talking to mom, she said that you can walk me down the aisle and she'll do the dance, or you can dance and she'll walk, it's your call but you need to choose soon."" 

I reiterated that I could not dance (she tried arguing that I had danced a little at my wedding but I made it clear that is different) and did not feel comfortable walking her. She got upset and said ""mom loves me why can't you?"" I felt bad but couldn't lie, I pointed out that she had John who loved her, my exwife, friends, she had people who love her. She said ""but other than (ex-wife) those aren't my parents"" I said ""neither am I."" She was very emotional so my wife and I gave them a few minutes.

My son and I were alone later, he looked exhausted. He said the problem was that after Mother's day Abbie had called Sally and kept saying they are both my daughters, that I did not get to be close with one but not both, and that it was them against me - but at that one Sally cried havoc and let slip the dogs of war. Things were said. Grievances were aired. John had to hang up before it got worse, but I guess Abbie was shaken but there was a new problem; Abbie had decided in her head that I did not mean what I have been saying and was just doing it for Sally. He told me he would handle it.

Ron Howard: He did not

So now I get text messages from Abbie every couple of days acting like we have a secret relationship Sally doesn't know about, she even called herself my secret daughter and lol'ed. She invited my wife to lunch saying ""2 out of 3 of his girl's"" going out. She has even started using the pressure of showing up at events like a recent barbecue to play a certain image. She hugs me more and holds it, wants to do pictures with just me or my wife and I but always a few with just me to post with captions I do not like. 

My wife is getting especially annoyed because of how she is with her (I guess Abbie surprised her with father's day plans for me that had to be shut down, as it is she still inserted herself into the day) but she has a soft spot for her and when Abbie gets emotional she caves; my wife is a sweetheart.

I asked him if he is upset with me and he said no, he just wished it was different. He said we're good, but he's worried he and Sally aren't, which is when I took the advice of some people and suggested pre marital counseling, he said he would talk about it. Abbie is insisting Sally go to her fitting. 

That shop should pay-per-view that potential royal rumble because Sally is not holding her feelings back anymore. I told him Sally loves him and I'll talk to her, but for now it is stressful all around. Abbie driving my wife crazy with her ideas for what my ""girls"" should be doing, driving me crazy with dad-daughter content, drove sally to the edge, and oh yeah, last night sent me an email with 3 styles of father-daughter dances and song options, so i'm not feeling any more respected or heard than before. 

The six of us have barely been in the same room in order to let things calm down since father's day, which was great until it was a shit show. Sorry this is so long, with all the craziness this is still the abridged version. We are supposed to meet Friday, Sally's partner and I have a bet going about how bad it will go. So onward and upward, I hope you fathers had a less dramatic day than I did, and by any chance does anyone know exactly how bad of a crime I need to commit to enter witness protection? Just curious

&nbsp;

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/vY1O52Txmv): **October 2, 2024 (3.5 months later)**

I have gotten requests for updates on my situation, and as I enjoy a refreshing mojito and my wife her nojito, life feels good and the perfect time to amuse the world with my pain and familial drama! Plus a cousin of mine who apparently reads these and knows my situation gave me the convincing argument of ""dude, you can't keep people hanging"" and how can I argue with that airtight argument. I apologize for how long this is, a lot has happened.

My wife's pregnancy is going well, keeping her as stress-free and pampered as possible has been my focus. It is such a different experience this time, both because of how much more involved I can be and how much better a relationship I have with my wife than I had with my ex. My daughter Sally has been great, even her partner has been great, helping with the nursery or driving her around when I can't. My wife doesn't know because it is a surprise, but my son has been building a crib for the baby, modeled after the one I built for him and his sister, to show my wife his support. My son is a good man, and he is still in there, he just has a soft spot for Abbie. Which I guess gets us to the part of the movie where Godzilla shows up and starts busting up buildings...

So I called a family meeting with my kids to talk about the situation. Told John his sister was only doing wedding activities she wanted to and that the guilting requests needed to stop, that this was hurting his relationship with his sister. Sally was happy I said it so she did not have to yet again. I told him if he did not stop her from messaging me I would block her with a bluntly honest explanation why. We got a lot out, John seemed to understand but then a few days later they insisted on coming to talk. Sally and I decided we would get everything out. 

So all of us ate at our place, Abbie started in immediately about baby shower stuff and I told that is the kind of thing we wanted to talk about. I told her that I understood she has been trying to fill a hole that she has, that she thought she was getting a father, a second mother (she calls my ex-wife mom apparently) and a sister. I told her it was still possible but that she needed to start listening to us. I told her that for the sake of family we would give her a fresh start, if she agreed that moving forward she would respect our boundaries. My daughter did not love this idea but loves her brother and was willing to try. 

Abbie tried to say that since we were starting over we could define what the relationship would be and just be family, we told her we were not ready for that, that it needs to happen organically. She got mad that I am closer with my daughter's partner, which is true but we just get along, and that she deserved it for trying so hard. My daughter said something about trying things we actually want. She ran to our bathroom, he ran after her. After a while I checked on him, I could hear her repeating ""this is not what I wanted."" My wife, daughter, and her partner went out to the patio to give them privacy and salvage the night, after a bit I got a text saying they had just left.

I checked in with him the next day and he said they talked more at home and she understood. For a couple of weeks things were good. The texts stopped except the occasional wedding question, since it was getting closer. She stopped pushing herself on my wife and Sally, and we thought was involving us in less in wedding planning out of respect, since as it was they only got the venue at the rate they did because of my professional connections and they know I was willing to help but not interested in helping plan, even if I am good at event-planning. 

But then I got a call from the venue telling me the card I used had been declined. Now this is a specific card I use for big purchases because of the miles so I knew it had a high limit. That was how I learned that they had changed dates by two months despite being informed I would still be out much of the money because it was too close to the date. I was furious, I mean I have been lucky in life financially but I am not blow-off deposits like nothing wealthy. Called my son, said he needed to get his ass to the house, just him. They both came.

When they arrived I opened the door, she actually started with, ""Dad!"" I think I just replied ""you have got to be f'n kidding me"" and walked toward the table. Abbie had the nerve to ask where dinner was, my response was not polite as I made it clear that was not why they were here. I hoped my son would not lie to me so I asked what was going on with the venue. She started going into wedding details but my son interrupted to tell me they postponed because my ex-wife was unavailable because of a surgery and he had not told me because he was putting money together to pay the lost money himself, and he had just reached out to guests to let them know. And that is when Abbie's mouth opened...""we have extra time to work on our dance...""

Now during this time my wife came home, and i was walking her toward the bedroom when Abbie said that. My pregnant wife with me I said, calmly, ""I have different feelings about that and will elaborate further shortly"" or something like that. Then I laid my wife down and got her water, turned on her symphonic covers of popular songs and walked back to the table and said something like ""You are out of your f'n mind have you even been listening?!"" I made it clear I was done with this nonsense, we all were, and kind of lost it asking she did not hear us last time because her head was up her ass. She was stunned silent (what a beautiful sound) and looked at me while I, admittedly with little filter, explained what Sally and I thought of our time with her and her attempts to force us to love her without even getting to know us. She started crying and stood up and shouted ""then what was this even for?!"" 

John asked what she meant, if she meant them and he started to freak out. She was frantic and said she meant delaying the wedding. Because, and I'm pouring another drink to write this, it was a ploy! My ex-wife and her decided if I HAD MORE TIME I would come around. Apparently my ex told her not to worry about the money because ""I am loaded."" She has always been bitter I make so much more than I did when we were married, as if that is out of spite rather than my career arc. I think she did that on purpose, frankly.

But she not only told me that lie, she and my ex told John as well. He was distraught. Repeating ""you lied to me"" as she tried to spin it but he was letting it out about how much he has defended her and covered for her and she lied to him too. She was defensive and blamed my ex for telling her things and me for being stubborn, she yelled ""why can't I just f'n call him dad"" and, finally, after so long, I heard John respond ""because he is not your f'n dad!"" She started crying and something about his being the one that told she could call me that and he said he told her she might be able to eventually but he had told her again and again to slow down. She started sobbing and went to sit on her chair but missed and fell on the floor. Appreciating physical humor to break the tension I admittedly chuckled and hid my mouth behind my drink, this all led to a lot of sobbing. I said I needed to check on my wife and as I walked out she was repeating ""I just want him to be my dad too.""

I came out and he was walking her to the door and apologized, I said not too, they left. He came over a few days later and said they had a long talk at home, he even asked her if she would have dated him if there was never a chance of being in the family. He believed her when she said yes but she admitted I was a big draw as well. I was the kind of dad she always wanted, my relationship with Sally is what she always wanted, and the way she said it gave John doubts that she loves him for him. I talked about marriage counseling, how his mother and I tried it and, while it did not save us, it provided clarity and an impartial voice. I pointed out they both like coming to me, but I cannot be impartial and if they are trying then they need to do it for real.

Abbie texted asking if I was the one who suggested therapy, I responded with ""does it matter if John wants to?"" She asked why it is so bad she wants to know what I think and I just said john is the man whose opinion should matter most to her. They fought due to the text, she agreed to the counseling and the wedding has been postponed!! I may have done a dance. So they are in counseling, he said she struggles but I obviously do not know details. She is pressing for me and Sally to go to a session with her, Sally told her she did not want to hear Sally unfiltered, and I am not interested. Abbie has been leaving Sally alone, she stopped texting me except for the occasional general question which include some attempt to go deeper. My wife still occasionally spends time with her because she is very into her pregnancy, more so than I like but it is my wife's call. So that is where we are, sorry it was so long but alcohol makes for a poor editor.

[Update #3](https://www.reddit.com/u/GreatestThrow-man/s/duDEjbeuXu): **November 20, 2024 (1.5 months later)**

I was told I should do updates here, people have been asking me to, and to get into what went down on father's day and at their mother's house, I have been extremely busy these last few months but am enjoying my temporary unemployment and thought of this account because of recent thanksgiving drama. I will do a an update and then will share what happened earlier. Oh, and to whomever made the joke that Abbie finally got me to dance, that made me laugh, I shared that with the family.

My time has been largely caring for my wife, I tend to dote, I know. We are having a boy! We are really excited, though neither of us really had gender preference. I have raised both and both experiences were wonderful. Now we are discussing names, who we are going to honor. I thought everything had been quiet, but recently found my wife crying and found out I was wrong. Given how busy I have been with work, and my wife knowing I would be free again once we got into this month, my wife has kept this to herself. Apparently Abbie has been pushing for one thanksgiving this year. Things have been quiet with Abbie, my son said the wedding blowing up woke her up, and that therapy had been helping. But then this.

My understanding is that while John has been talking less with his mother because of all that happened, Abbie did the opposite. From my wife's telling, Abbie dropped by one day with my ex wife. My wife intensely dislikes my ex wife because of lies she spread about my first marriage ending due to infidelity with her, despite their being no infidelity and the linear nature of time making it impossible for us to have slept together back then. Before anyone asks, my ex wife does not actually think there was infidelity, I would get into that, but I am sure I would sound biased.

Anyway so my wife looked at our camera app, saw who it was and called my daughter; apparently the two of them were keeping things from me because I was working 18 hour days and they did not want me dealing with anything else. I wish they had not done that, but I appreciate the thought. I am really lucky to have such caring people around me. My daughter called her mom and said something that made them leave in a hurry, she will not tell me what but she smiles when I ask. I called John but he was dealing with somehard work news, so I just was there for him and left the other alone. 

The next day Abbie came back, alone this time. My wife saw it was her and asked her what she wanted through the door, Abbie said to apologize. My wife let her in (she is too nice) and after a nice talk Abbie asked about the whole family getting together for thanksgiving, my wife said of course, she assumed as much. 

A couple of days later in our groupchat we were discussing details, who brings what, and Abbie asks what else is needed. I say John already committed and she asked what about my ex wife, what should she bring. In the time I have known Abbie she has never made an intentional joke that funny, so I asked what she was talking about and she mentioned the ""whole family"" comment, and my daughter and I both asked what made her think we counted her as family?? She actually replied ""she is my family. i don't have a dad who wants me, just a mom and my mom deserves to be with family on thanksgiving"" 

Sally replied ""well we'll miss you and John then."" Abbie asks how she can say that, Sally asks how she can be so stupid, John says not to call her stupid and I say that is fair but there is no real way she thought my wife thought she meant my ex wife(at this point my wife had filled me in). And then...this is so stupid...she uses my son's phone to add my ex frigging wife to the group chat. She then thanks us for the invitation and asks what she can bring! As I was typing my daughter beats me to it and asks what she thinks she is doing, she knows she is not welcome- but says it less politely. My wife types ""you could not have thought she was included when I said family."" Abbie responded that she was not coming as my family but as hers.

Sally let her mom have it, she already is not talking to her much and said if my exwife is there then she is not. I mentioned there was never a chance ex was going to come and said I understand Abbie and John wanting to go to their mom's house so she is not alone. John typed ""plans not definite, will let you know"" He has since told me that he is not going to go to his mom's place but wanted to tell Abbie alone first. All I can think about is the comment about not having a dad who wants her, because it means she is still thinking about me as a dad, I believe. Just a negligent one. I mentioned that to my son and he said he noticed it to and had brought it up at therapy, because family is such a frequent topic, though I obviously do not know details.

Wow I thought this would be brief but that was a lot, I will get into the crazy stories later if there are people seeing this who want me to. I do not know how posting from here works in terms of anyone seeing it, but this has been good to get out.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Someone needs to explain sunk cost fallacy to John. I genuinely cannot believe he is still with her after the sheer volume of times she has disrespected him, his boundaries, and your family. Maybe this was back in an earlier post but has anyone really taken the time to reason with him that there are other women out there and he deserves so much better than this kind of relationship?

> **OOP:** I had a talk when this started, so did his sister. After the blowup with the wedding his sister and I took him out for a game and some time to really talk after, that was when he apparently demanded counseling. I am happy that for now marriage is on hold, at least. He is seeing her a bit more honestly, but is still too optimistic, in my view.

**OOP needs to let his wife know not to let Abbie in when he is not home.**

> **OOP:** I have asked my wife to never let her in if I am not here after last time. Well, actually I had already asked her, but after the last incident my wife has agreed.

+

> You are exactly correct that she takes advantage of my wife's kindness, though once our boy is here I think she will be very protective and will hold strong. I have told John that Abbie will not be holding our baby, at least for the foreseeable future.

**OOP and his daughter need to have a serious talk with his son about Abbie**

> **OOP:** His sister and I had a serious conversation with him a little after everything blew up, it seems to be what inspired both his demand for counseling and putting the marriage on hold. He is better about seeing her honestly, his sister said something about Abbie having similarities to their mother, which would have been fighting words from anyone else (and I saw the temper that rarely comes out) but then he listened because she clearly put thought into it. I never thought about it, I am proud to have kids smarter than me (I know my boy don't come off a genius in these posts, and fsir enough in that dept., but professionally he is brilliant). She laid her reasoning out in excruciating detail, he listened though because she was not enjoying it at all, it was sincere. Some seemed to have clicked because since that talk he has been different with her. I just am not getting my hopes up.

**Commenter 2:** When two crazies are feeding off each other‚Äôs crazy they can start thinking anything is possible. I have a feeling that even if your son leaves her she‚Äôs not going to go away peacefully. Her and your ex sound like peas in a pod unfortunately.

> **OOP:** My daughter really went at him pointing out their similarities. She made her case well and thankfully it shook him up.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[mini update - I may have my boy back!](https://www.reddit.com/user/GreatestThrow-man/comments/1hdnte1/mini_update_i_may_have_my_boy_back/): **December 13, 2024 (almost one month later)**

I do not have time to elaborate right now but I am so excited I had to share this, Thanksgiving went so badly that my son called off the engagement itself and is now going to stay at our place while he figures out his next step! 

He came over Sunday night exhausted and asked if he could use the guest room and we talked for a couple of hours, I understand a bit more why he felt trapped now but he realizes if she does not see her issues then he cannot help her with them. I am taking him and his sister for a fun day on Saturday to just have some fun, he looks so tired and just needs some fun. 

Hopefully, while yes things are messy, he is moving in a better direction for himself. People here have been great and genuinely seemed to be rooting for him which I appreciate, so I just thought I would share the good news. Happy holidays, especially mine as he told her she was not invited!!

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I'm so glad you have your son back! But she's so delusional it may get worse before it gets better.

> **OOP:** I agree she will not be easy to disentangle from, I doubt she will let it be easy. We already have cameras outside in multiple spots, and Abbie does not have a key. I feel like we got my son back and Abbie got my ex-wife, I will take that deal in a heartbeat!

**Commenter 2:** I mean, I'm a long-time mental health professional, so I've seen some shit, thus I'm immediately picturing, upon your son officially ending it for good, her having a full on psychotic break and regressing into a child, throwing a full blown, kicking and screaming on the ground, shamelessly snotty and drooling no-fucks-given ugly-crying, DEFCON TODDLER level tantrum on the spot, screaming desperately for ""her"" Daddy, and raging at your son - not because he doesn't love her, or because he rejected her romantically, or any reason we would find realistic in our plane of what we consider ""logic"" - but rather accusing your son of taking ""her"" Daddy away and trying to keep HER AND YOU from being the family you were always meant to be.

Honestly, this type of crazy is so familiar to me, I could practically write the speech myself üôÉ.

BUT! This is NOT meant to be a prediction. This is just a worst-case-scenario type possibility, which is OBVIOUSLY what popped into my head, because, a.) Far too many years of personal experience in a professional capacity with ""worst-case-scenarios"" like this and even MORE crazy...

and 2.) redditlol.

> **OOP:** He told me all about their conversation and how it confirmed to him he was making the right choice. It sounds like you are right about shouting and throwing things and said he was taking away her chance to have a family. There was a lot more, some I know, a lot I do not, but well done with your highly-educated guess, I cannot imagine the stories that you must have.

**OOP on how Thanksgiving turned out so badly**

> **OOP:** It was pretty bad, Abbie showed up with my ex wife despite the fact there was never a chance that woman would be allowed in my house. It got ugly from there and my son really let them both have it. He is done with his mom, both of my kids are, which after years of seething about lies she told about me but needing to hold it in around them, it is all out there now.

**Commenter 3:** Omg I have been waiting for your update, I hope your family and wife are all well. I'm sorry to hear about your son and I hope he heals, but he has done the right thing, he will find an amazing woman. I no its probably not going to happen but I hope the drama settles and I shall away your update with the dets

> **OOP:** That is why I came to post, some people have been really great on here and seem to be genuinely concerned, which I did not expect but felt meant I should catch people up. He is seeming like his old self, best gift for the holidays I could have asked for you know, but I know this will be a process for him. We will be here for him.

**Commenter 4:** His lucky to have such a great dad, you have been so smooth and chill through all of this, sounds like he has the support he needs to get thorugh this, I hope life gets better for him and you guys too

> **OOP:** Thank you, there were many times I wanted to be more assertive, but I worried that since he loves her and they were living together, which meant she could be in his ear constantly, that if I pushed it would either push him away or cause him to push back. It has been bad but while I know he has not given up on the relationship completely, he now knows she needs to show him she is working on herself or he is done. He moved a lot of clothes here, and when she messaged last week he asked her if she had been following through on something, and when she said no he was furious. He told me that he does not trust her and I asked him if there is can even be the foundation for a relationship without total trust and he said no. I think he is getting there!

For miles, the land was a patchwork of desolation, empty storefronts, skeletal factories, and neighborhoods fighting to hold onto their last threads of dignity. My companion, Jonah, leaned forward in the passenger seat, his face lit by the ghostly glow of the dashboard.

‚ÄúYou feel that?‚Äù he muttered, tapping the window. ‚ÄúThe weight? The decay? It‚Äôs not just in the air, it‚Äôs in the bones of this place.‚Äù

Jonah was never one for subtlety. He held a notebook in one hand, scribbling furiously as if he could exorcise the despair around us through sheer force of ink. I, on the other hand, gripped the wheel tighter, trying to ignore the relentless march of billboards touting false promises. ‚ÄúBetter Jobs. Stronger Future,‚Äù they claimed, their glossy veneer peeling back to reveal rot and neglect.

We pulled into a gas station on the outskirts of Greece. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting everything in a sickly yellow glow. A clerk barely old enough to vote watched us through the bulletproof glass, her face pale and drawn. The television behind her blared a news segment about tax incentives for some luxury development in Manhattan. She caught my gaze and offered a bitter laugh.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not from around here, are you?‚Äù she asked as she slid our change through the slot.

Jonah smiled, though it was more a baring of teeth. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just passing through,‚Äù he said, pocketing a handful of snack wrappers. ‚ÄúBut I get the feeling you‚Äôve seen this show before.‚Äù

She shrugged, looking away. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter what they promise. We don‚Äôt see any of it.‚Äù

The words lingered as we made our way into Rochester proper. The streets were an odd dichotomy of ambition and abandonment. The city felt alive, but just barely, like a boxer staggering through the twelfth round. Historic mansions loomed in the shadows of dilapidated duplexes, and potholes made the journey feel like driving over a field of landmines.

‚ÄúThey build skyscrapers for hedge funds and leave these people to rot,‚Äù Jonah said, his voice rising as he pointed out a particularly decrepit bridge. ‚ÄúThe state‚Äôs like a parasite. It‚Äôs draining these towns dry to fatten New York City.‚Äù

We found a greasy spoon diner in the South Wedge, its neon sign flickering like a dying heartbeat. Inside, the booths were filled with the quiet desperation of locals clutching cups of coffee like lifelines. Our waitress, a woman whose face bore the weary marks of years spent chasing vanishing opportunities, didn‚Äôt bother with pleasantries.

Jonah leaned forward when she brought the coffee. ‚ÄúWhat keeps people here?‚Äù he asked, his voice low but insistent.

She paused, her eyes flicking between us and the muted TV playing behind the counter. It showed a montage of ribbon-cuttings and handshakes, politicians smiling as if they‚Äôd saved the world. ‚ÄúSome of us can‚Äôt afford to leave,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe rest of us‚Ä¶ I guess we‚Äôre just stubborn.‚Äù

The night closed in as we left the diner, the city growing stranger by the minute. Under the dim streetlights, the Genesee River seemed to glow with an unearthly hue, its waters sluggish and choked with decades of industrial runoff.

Buildings twisted into grotesque caricatures, their windows like hollow eyes staring down in judgment. The bridges groaned with phantom voices, whispering tales of corruption and theft. Jonah‚Äôs rants grew louder, more unhinged, as he gestured wildly at the skyline. ‚ÄúThis is what they‚Äôve done,‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúThey bled these towns dry for Broadway shows and billion-dollar subway lines. Albany doesn‚Äôt even pretend to care anymore.‚Äù

By the time we reached our motel in Irondequoit, the car felt like a lifeboat adrift in a sea of decay. The neon sign outside buzzed weakly, casting the parking lot in a lurid red glow. Inside, the room smelled of mildew and resignation. Jonah sprawled across the bed, his notebook tossed aside, muttering about systemic greed and the illusion of progress.

I lay awake, staring at the cracked ceiling. The day‚Äôs images replayed in my mind, the hollow faces, the crumbling infrastructure, the relentless cycle of promises and betrayals. Upstate New York wasn‚Äôt just forgotten; it had been sacrificed. And the architects of its ruin sat in polished offices, tweeting platitudes about equity and opportunity.

Somewhere outside, the wind carried the faint sounds of the river, a reminder that even in neglect, life persists. But it was hard to shake the feeling that this place, and its people, were being swallowed whole, their voices drowned beneath the roar of a machine that refused to stop taking.

As sleep finally claimed me, I wondered if anyone would ever hear them.",1,1736398621.0,stories,1,1.0,False

I got a text from an unknown number, saying hi, with my name, followed by ""This is the only picture I have of you. I got it from your mother, ""mom's name"", when I asked for a picture of my daughter."" Then followed with a picture of me at age 7. He continued, ""I know this is hard, and I've respected your mom's desire to stay away for years, but I can no longer keep silent. You are my daughter. My name is ""X"" and I'm your biological father.""

I screenshotted the texts, sent them to my mom asking ""WTF is going on?!"". She didn't respond, so after about 10 minutes I called her. I asked if she saw my texts, she had. I asked ""Before anything else is said, I need to know, right now, is it true?"" She was quiet for about 3 seconds, then simply said yes.

My entire life, I've questioned my paternity. Mostly in a joking way, as I love my Dad to bits, but I've never had any resemblance to literally anyone on his side. In 2015 I did the Ancestry DNA thing, and it raised some actual doubt. It didn't connect me to anyone on Dad's side, even though a few had mentioned doing it. It also identified many DNA matches over the last 10 years, none of which I recognized, even though they were listed as extremely close matches. I asked my mom many times over the last 10 years, was she sure Dad was my dad? She always swore yes. That the matches must be from various uncles having kids they didn't acknowledge. 

About 6 weeks ago, X, my bio father, went to my mom's house and left a note with his phone number. When she didn't respond, he went back about 2 weeks ago, and she was home. They spoke, and he told her he would no longer keep silent, and that this had gone on long enough. She refused to connect him to me. So he used fb, and found my bakery business page, which has my number listed, and reached out. He had told her he would contact me regardless of her wishes, and that it would be better for me to learn about this from her. She had multiple opportunities over the last 6 weeks to tell me, and chose not to. 

When he told me his name in the initial texts, I immediately remembered him. He used to call my mom, and always asked to say hi to me. He would send me cards for my birthday, and every holiday, until about age 12 when we moved to a new town, changed phone numbers, etc. I even remember going to visit him at his mom's house. All that time, my mom said he was just an old friend. Which is true, they've known each other since kindergarten, and were each other's first ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" in 1st grade. When we moved to that new town, she made sure he couldn't contact us anymore. 

My Dad was a great father to me. I don't feel any differently about him, nor will I. I love him. But I do want to get to know this person, and my extended family from him. I have an aunt and multiple uncles. Cousins. A living grandmother. My mom is... difficult. She apologized a million times. But also told me he wasn't a good person back then, and she hoped until the moment I was born that I was my dad's. It was a one night stand with X, while she had separated from my dad due to constant arguing, for a few weeks. She knew my Dad was more secure, stable, had his shit together. X didn't. And when I was born, she knew immediately X was my father. The only people who knew were her, her best friend, one other friend who passed away when I was 13, and X. 

She says she didn't tell me to protect me, to protect my dad. I told her she was also protecting herself, especially not telling me after I was an adult, with children, having serious health issues. At that point, the only thing she gained by continuing the lie was protecting herself and what me or other people thought of her. 

My Dad's health is fragile. He has early stage Alzheimers Dementia, and myriad health issues. While he has another child from his first marriage, before my mom, they're not close. She lives half a country away, and has little contact with us. I'm all he has as he ages and declines. I've decided I'm not going to tell him. It would devastate him emotionally, which would seriously exacerbate his health issues. And this information doesn't change anything for me about our relationship, how I feel about him or see him. He's my Dad, in every way that matters. 

But I also want to get to know X. He tried so hard for so many years to be in my life, even on the periphery, until my mom blocked further contact. Don't I deserve a chance to know that side of my family? Doesn't he deserve a chance to know his daughter, and grandchildren? He never had any other children. I'm it. And maybe he wasn't a good person back then, but clearly my mom was no angel, so I don't know how much weight to put on her opinion of him. He was a good enough person for her to be friends with him for well over 30 years. 

He's coming to my state later this month, to visit his mom who still lives here. He'd like to meet for coffee, to talk in person. I'd like to do it. I want to give him a chance to show me who he is. If he isn't a good person, I lose nothing by walking away. But if he is, I've gained a bonus father. And a whole family. All his siblings and his mother know about me. 

How do I handle this? How do I process all of this? I feel so completely detached from reality, I've been in and out of total dissociation since I found out. My brain feels like a tornado.

1hx58fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1hx58fs/help_and_advice_on_trying_to_lose_weight_whilst/,Help and advice on trying to lose weight whilst having endometriosis ,"Hi, I've (35f) had endometriosis since I was 14, I've had multiple surgeries and I'm due another in the next 2 months. I have stage 4 and it's mainly on my bowel, bladder, Douglas pouch, rectum and vagina. I'm only mentioning this as it is relevant. 

Since my last surgery 2 years ago I had a great 6 months or so and weighed around 9 Stone. I weighed around 7 stone my whole adult life until I started having kids. Then the pain resurfaced and it's been very severe to the point I'm on morphine regularly. 
Since this I have gained 2 and a half stone putting me at 11 stone 6/74kg and in the obese category for my height. 

I have never had belly fat, never. I now have rolls for days, my thighs are so flabby I've never seen anything like it. And the amount of cellulite I have is honestly next level. 
I suffer with manic depression and it's sending me deeper into a pit. I've had to buy new clothes that I cannot afford and now I'm wearing joggers and  hoodies every day and I've gone from a size 10 to a 16-18. 

The reason I mentioned the endometriosis of the bladder is because I cannot consume water like most people. If I drink just half a pint of water I feel like I'm going to burst no matter how much I pee, its beyond uncomfortable. It sounds bizarre because I drink coffee all day and have no issue with that. 

I can live with the bladder issue if I don't have to go anywhere and I'll do it to lose weight. 

My other concern is I suffer seizures and near fainting episodes multiple times a day. I have a problem with my brain, my vessels are enlarged in the part of my brain that's responsible for my vision so I cannot do anything fast e.g. running. 

This is what I'm thinking of doing to try and lose weight but I need advice on if this is going to get me anywhere. I need to get this fat into muscle at least, I like being curvy (my hubby likes it too lol) I would like to lose enough to get out of the overweight catagory though which is 9 stone 6/61kg. I'll be completely honest on what I tend to eat too. I'm autistic and struggle with food, there isn't a lot I'll eat. 

Walk 10,000 steps a day on weekdays (the school run) 
What I eat/drink 
Breakfast - I skip it so I burn fat instead of breakfast 
Dinner - a tuna sweetcorn sandwich on brown or boiled eggs on brown toast. 
Tea - spaghetti bolognese/tuna broccoli pasta bake/chicken pot pie/soup/microwave meals Inc fish pie/vegetable cottage pie and hotpot. 
Snacks - 1 creme egg after tea. 1 pack of lentil chips (66cals)
Drinks - the coffee sachets like vanilla/Caramel latte (3 a day) plus normal coffee with semi skimmed milk - no sugar (3 a day)

I am hurting so deeply, but I am moving forward, even if it is just through sheer determination. Today is the first day that I have felt okay. I wish I could tell you that. 

I wish I could tell you that I am choosing to care for myself in such an intense way that I am lost in it. I went through today with tunnel vision on things that make me feel like me. I got a coffee with a friend that I have never spent alone time with before, and it was filled with such beautiful conversations. I was actively engaged in all of my classes, able to focus again, and I even ate a meal at lunch time. Today is the first day that I have been able to eat for enjoyment and not survival. I engaged with my art form, my music, in a way that I haven't felt able to do in months, and I channeled the full intensity of these emotions into it. It was so beautiful, and I know you would be so proud to hear that. You fell in love with me because of my passion. I made the spontaneous decision to turn around from my commute home and go to a pilates class instead, something I haven't done since before our relationship. You always tried to help me heal my relationship with exercise. I picked out a bunch of healthy recipes to cook this week, and I bought all the ingredients. I wish I could tell you that; you were always so willing to adapt and eat better right alongside me. I listened to thoughtful podcasts on topics we used to discuss, and I took extensive notes about them. I wish I could discuss them with you and pick apart the nuances of any given topic for hours on end.

I had my first good day without you, and I wish I could tell you about it. 

It is the end of the day, and I sit writing this in my completely redone bedroom. The old one was too full of memories of you. Funny how that works; even my own space became yours. I sit alone, and I sit in my bed that can now stay in the corner of the room because it sleeps one instead of two. My room should feel good; it is filled with soft lights, a very nice candle, a cup of tea on my nightstand, uplifting music, my beautiful cat, and decorations that feel like *me*. But it does not have you. I experienced all of these good things today, and for the first time in a very long time, I did not have you to celebrate them with me.

One day, that will be okay. One day, I will experience good days not to prove that I can, but because I have built a life filled with good days that exist purely for me. I will exist in a joy that is so abundant that I am overwhelmed with it, and I will do that without needing someone by my side. One day, I will have a good day without feeling the weight of your absence. That day was not today.

One day, I will no longer wish to tell you about a good day. Until then, I hope this finds you, and I hope you are happy to hear this. I hope you are out there having a good day, too. ",2,1736398583.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

And when I was born, she knew immediately X was my father. The only people who knew were her, her best friend, one other friend who passed away when I was 13, and X. 

She says she didn't tell me to protect me, to protect my dad. I told her she was also protecting herself, especially not telling me after I was an adult, with children, having serious health issues. At that point, the only thing she gained by continuing the lie was protecting herself and what me or other people thought of her. 

My Dad's health is fragile. He has early stage Alzheimers Dementia, and myriad health issues. While he has another child from his first marriage, before my mom, they're not close. She lives half a country away, and has little contact with us. I'm all he has as he ages and declines. I've decided I'm not going to tell him. It would devastate him emotionally, which would seriously exacerbate his health issues. And this information doesn't change anything for me about our relationship, how I feel about him or see him. He's my Dad, in every way that matters. 

But I also want to get to know X. He tried so hard for so many years to be in my life, even on the periphery, until my mom blocked further contact. Don't I deserve a chance to know that side of my family? Doesn't he deserve a chance to know his daughter, and grandchildren? He never had any other children. I'm it. And maybe he wasn't a good person back then, but clearly my mom was no angel, so I don't know how much weight to put on her opinion of him. He was a good enough person for her to be friends with him for well over 30 years. 

He's coming to my state later this month, to visit his mom who still lives here. He'd like to meet for coffee, to talk in person. I'd like to do it. I want to give him a chance to show me who he is. If he isn't a good person, I lose nothing by walking away. But if he is, I've gained a bonus father. And a whole family. All his siblings and his mother know about me. 

How do I handle this? How do I process all of this? I feel so completely detached from reality, I've been in and out of total dissociation since I found out. My brain feels like a tornado.

I felt like a child in a candy store! LOL! Seeing ALL of their pods, and of course, they all look so cute on the shelves with their nice vibrant colors! 

The customer service was great, they offered me a sample of coffee, while I was waiting in line. 

It was a pleasant experience. Sadly, I won't be attending one anytime soon as it is a drive from my home. I just got my Nespresso for Christmas and I'm obsessed! I feel cheated all these years by not having one! LOL",5,1736398274.0,nespresso,1,0.86,False
1hx54kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/toxicparents/comments/1hx54kl/absolutely_insane_mil_extremely_intelligent_fil/,"Absolutely insane MIL, extremely intelligent FIL. ","Im 25 and im engaged to their son who is 20. I have a daughter who is 2. Not his biologically but definitely his daughter. 

His mom is absolutely bat shit insane and I have no idea what to do. For starters she has been a POS since before the accident. (I‚Äôll tell you after this) She abused all of her kids physically and mentally. Her daughter turned to self harm, her other son who passed turned to drugs, and my partner is probably the only one who escaped with just a lot of mental health issues. His step dad‚Äôs kids ran away between the ages of 16/17 and don‚Äôt talk to anyone anymore. And her only other kid is just a racist. That‚Äôs his only issue. It‚Äôs a big one but it doesn‚Äôt affect him. Just everyone around him. 

After her son OD‚Äôd (not my partner) and unfortunately passed she made it her life‚Äôs mission and goal to destroy the drug dealers life, and their families lives. The drug dealer in question is in prison obviously. And that I‚Äôm okay with. But now she hexes anyone and everyone. Including, well now, me‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôm not joking when I say hex. Think of like demonic witchcraft. Her house is terrifying at night. She has voodoo dolls on the wall, jars with literal shit in it in the closet, dead spiders that are framed on the walls. For a witch it‚Äôs paradise. For 50% of the population it‚Äôs creepy. For us it‚Äôs terrifying. 

Anyways I guess the final straw was tomatoes and watching our kid for an hour. He said he couldn‚Äôt dice tomatoes because his back hurt. Which that‚Äôs a bullshit excuse. But I digress. The one that really irked me was we put her to bed on December 11th at 6:00pm. We got ready to leave and made sure she was asleep then he asked her multiple times if she could watch our kid. She just nodded her head. (She was ignoring us because she was upset about the tomatoes)

Anyways we leave. And 10 minutes in we get a text and it‚Äôs her saying the baby is up. We are slight confused but we just wait for our coffee and continue like normal. 5 minutes more go by and she calls him. She starts going off on how the dishes should have been done by him, and She never agreed to watch her, and that she would have enjoyed the Christmas lights too. (We took her yesterday and told his mom about it but she was in a mood and just ignored us) Then told me it was time for me to grow up and treat her better. Which is bullshit because up until this we never went on a date without her. Even in the EARLY stages of dating, never. She was always with us. 

Also on the dishes, I told her I‚Äôd do it and she told me no she could do it herself and shushed me away. Not pushed. Just ushered me out of the kitchen. 

Then the next day she starts looking up signs of child abuse books on Amazon, (don‚Äôt ask me how I know) and texting her friends how I physically abuse my daughter (again don‚Äôt ask me how I know) and it‚Äôs insane. 

The only real thing that could have been constituted as abuse would have been when she got a nursemaid‚Äôs elbow. Basically she jumped off of our bed and I grabbed her by the arm because there was a glass snake enclosure next to the bed I didn‚Äôt want her busting her head into glass. Even the doctor said it was normal. 

Other than that, obviously I don‚Äôt spank her. I don‚Äôt hit in general unless it‚Äôs like her touching an outlet, or touching the hot stove. Which I deem as fair. It‚Äôs not abuse in my opinion but maybe it is. Who knows. I don‚Äôt scream at her. She‚Äôs a pretty good kid so I don‚Äôt have to. 

So we left because both her and her husband are police officers and she‚Äôs a mandated reporter. Seems normal. 

Now she‚Äôs acting insane and innocent at the same time. The car that was gifted to him had to be returned THAT night otherwise they were reporting it stolen. They immediately sold it to get a security system. Within a few days. She is acting like I‚Äôm abusing her son and our daughter. Which is far from the truth. And that I made threats. Which I never did? 

I have receipts I just don‚Äôt know how/if I can post it here. It‚Äôs just ridiculous .-.

But the most insane part is she did several hex‚Äôs on me. Two of them maybe worked. It causes nightmares and headaches. But honestly I have a UTI and migraines so idk if that‚Äôs even real lolzz. 

I just feel like she is the one that needs help. But atp I don‚Äôt want to mend this relationship, I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs worth it. I just want advice on how I can help my partner through this. Obviously there is a lot of ‚ÄúI‚Äù and ‚ÄúMe‚Äù because I‚Äôm definitely pissed, annoyed, hurt, and frustrated. But he‚Äôs really struggling. And I want him to get better and maybe he can repair that relationship with her. As for me? I could care less about that old hag. Dorthy should have parked her house on her in ‚Äò08. But I will smile and nod my way through it for him if that‚Äôs what I have to. I just have no idea how to even start. ",1,1736398219.0,toxicparents,1,1.0,False

I just wanted to take a second and introduce ourselves to the community! 
We're opening Reggie's Manga Shop, an all ages space that is designed more or less like a Japanese convenience store with a manga shop. 

My partner and I grew up without many spaces that we could occupy as kids and teenagers. We know also noticed this lack in Portland as well, and we're excited to create the space we always imagined when we were growing up :)

We have a hot case for drinks/food like Boss coffee and musubi. We'll have egg salad sandos, fruit sandos and katsu sandos in our cold case. We'll also have a cup noodle bar, where you can pick your cup noodle, have a hot water kettle and a choice of toppings. Keep an eye out for themed food pop-ups like skewsday (skewer Tuesday on our charcoal grill) and food themed anime and manga events (think Dungeon Meshi)


We're located in Arbor Lodge, right on Greeley avenue in the old JD's shoe repair building. We plan on having classes, workshops, manga reading clubs, stationary clubs, as well as summer camps for all ages (adults too!)


 We're already starting to partner with artists and teachers to do things like early age Japanese classes on the weekends, art classes, cosplay workshops and more! Our community room, where our classes and workshops will be hosted, is also available for our community to rent and reserve, with specific monthly time for free reservations for the under 21 crowd. Weekly, during business hours, we also plan to have quiet hours in our community room, and special hours for kids. 

We'll also have a free community library with over 500 volumes available for our customers to read while you enjoy a nice snack or a yummy drink! In our retail section, you'll find a vest variety of manga available for purchase, an incredible stationary section and toys too!

Right now with our build out, we're slotted to be open March 1st! Please feel free to follow our Instagram (@reggiesmangashop) for more in-depth updates. Thank you so much for the support!


If you read this far, thank you so much. We're really excited about this project and we hope you're excited too!",45,1736398162.0,Portland,6,0.94,False
1hx5351,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hx5351/just_a_newbie_wanting_to_say_thanks/,Just a newbie wanting to say thanks,"I got an espresso machine for xmas and had no idea what i was doing. however searching around this sub and a couple videos i was able to figure everything out, get upgrades, and start making some pretty tasty espresso.

yall are a good group of people and make things easy for us noobs with the million posts about every problem and question you can think of.



------------------------------------
for those interested here is my story so far. 


my wife decided to get me an espresso machine since ive talked about it over the years. my philosophy with new gear is to get something good enough to be usable until i know what im doing and know exactly what i want for a spendy option.

she knows this of course so for xmas i got...

espresso machine: delonghi stilosa   
grinder: beeone burr grinder (electric)  
coffee: some bags from trade coffee until i know better what i want

i messed around with the first bag of coffee (wizard cat from cerberus) and while i could make a drink that was fine with milk and chocolate (my prefered drink from coffee shops was mocha) the shots were too bitter or acidic or something. i honestly dont know how to describe that correctly.

--------------------

since then i got a new kitchen scale that can accurately measure .1 grams and do so quickly, unlike my last one.

a real tamper instead of that plastic pos that came with the machine.

and i decided to take the leap and get an unpressurized naked portafilter and just see if i thought it was fine or not with the stilosa.

this was a huge change, it took several batches, but im making espresso now that looks about the same as yalls, with a nice crema, and good flavor even straight up as a shot, no channeling or spurts....most of the time, i still mess up now and then.

i also got a funnel to help my not make a mess and a wdt instead of using a cake doneness checker thing. it made a bigger difference than i thought it would.

my second batch of coffee is blendo stupendo from sterling coffee roasters, and this one seems quite tasty to me, both straight and with my milk and chocolate.




anyway, thanks yall!",1,1736398077.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

When I bend forwards, or if I look to the right, the dizziness seems to worsen a lot. Other than this, it happens randomly all the time, especially without warning or probable cause.
I am currently using:
Methotrexate, (Psoriatic arthritis) (oncePW)
Lucovorin, (oncePW)
Pantoprazole, (daily)
Celecoxib (as needed)
And Paxil (daily) (PTSD, SevereAnxiety)

I don't drink any alcohol, rarely will take an eddible (they are legal in Canada no worries!), I don't smoke, and will usually have a coffee a day.
Aside from mental health diagnosis this covers the basis. 
I've had recent bloodwork, throughout my whole life every indicator is within normal range except for my liver functions heavily spiked during the most recent test.(most likely due to the methotrexate)
I wear a smart watch to monitor my heart rate, it typically either sits around 50 if I'm calm, or 80 if stressed. It will peak around 120 or so if I'm panicking, or doing some kind of labor-intensive task.
I do have Asthma, and am allergic to mold, which I know is rampant this time of year, but my blood oxygen levels are also 98% and above(this watch is cool!) 

I'm quite lost at what to do here, at first I thought it was due to exhaustion, then maybe this or that, but nothing yielded any proof or results to show why this is happening. If I stop caffeine, it doesn't really impact much either.

It had been months before I finally got the courage to say something. I walked from behind her and jokingly told her she had missed a quiz (she didn't come to class that day). We started talking from then and the conversation went way better than I expected and she was so nice and we had similar interests. We were walking while talking and when we reached where we had to go our separate ways, she gave me her number without me asking and I almost died from the shock of it. But I played it as cool as I could and left.

The next time I saw her in class I genuinely felt ashamed speaking to her in class. I don't know why. She smiled and waved at me in class but I couldn't get myself to commit more than a smile. From then things became awkward. I think she started avoiding me and I did not want to go out of my way to speak with her either. The next time I saw her in class she turned her head to look in my direction but I think when she saw that I was already looking at her, she turned her eyes away before turning her head back in the direction she was walking.

I saw her again after class. This time she used a different way and I just played it cool. I was walking away but then I turned back and decided to walk where I saw her to talk to her. I did not expect to see her as soon as I took a turn and it was like her beauty plus the shock of seeing her gave me a gut punch. I'm usually a confident person but at that moment I was stammering and sniffling (it was cold outside) like a neek. It was so embarrassing. I knew after the conversation I probably gave her the ick. I had the walk of shame back to my dorm. Can you imagine that when I went to my dorm I still had the balls to text her if she wanted to get coffee?

When it comes to understanding ""diamond fire,"" a few key points can help you appreciate what makes a diamond truly remarkable:

* Fire refers to the dispersion of white light into rainbow colors within the diamond.
* The quality of a diamond's cut is crucial for exhibiting fire. Well-cut diamonds display more fire than poorly cut ones.
* Lighting conditions significantly impact the visibility of fire. Singular, direct light sources enhance it.
* Virtual facets, created by precise cutting, play a critical role in producing fire.
* AGS Laboratories provide scientific assessments of a diamond's fire, offering a reliable metric for light performance.
* To ensure you're selecting a diamond that dazzles with fire, prioritize excellent cut quality and understand the lighting conditions that make this beautiful optical effect shine.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing [from trusted retailers such as those](https://labdiamondsreview.com/diamonds/) that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Diamond enthusiasts looking to understand the science behind a diamond's sparkle
* Buyers seeking high-quality diamonds with exceptional light performance
* Individuals who appreciate the intricate visual effects of gemstones
* Those willing to invest in higher-quality cuts for enhanced beauty

# Who is this not for?

* Budget-conscious shoppers who prioritize size over quality
* Buyers looking for average-quality stones without consideration of light performance
* Those uninterested in the technical aspects of diamond optics

# Recommendations for smart buying

1. Prioritize cut quality: Look for diamonds graded as ""Ideal"" or ""Excellent"" cut.
2. Consider smaller table facets: These often produce more fire than larger tables.
3. Evaluate in various lighting: Ask to see the diamond under different light sources.
4. Use reputable retailers: James Allen and Blue Nile specialize in high-quality cut diamonds.
5. Check for AGS certification: Their light performance grading provides valuable insight.

# FAQ

Q: What's the difference between fire and brilliance?A: Fire is the colored light dispersion, while brilliance refers to white light reflections.

Q: Can all diamonds exhibit fire?A: All diamonds can potentially exhibit fire, but the quality of the cut greatly affects how much.

Q: Does diamond size affect fire?

A: Size itself doesn't directly impact fire, but larger diamonds may provide more surface area for light dispersion.

Q: How does lighting affect diamond fire?A: Direct, small light sources like spotlights or sunlight enhance fire visibility. Diffused light tends to suppress it.

Q: Are there specific diamond shapes that show more fire?A: Round brilliant and cushion cuts are known for exhibiting good fire when well-cut.

Remember, while fire is a beautiful aspect of diamonds, it's just one factor to consider. Balance your priorities between fire, brilliance, and other characteristics to find your perfect diamond.

Things were going great except recently. 
I feel like I am seeing narcissistic behavior and gaslighting. Problem is I have no choice right now but to stay. I'm trying to figure out how to navigate this peacefully for a little while longer. 
How do you try to not make a situation worse when you stay quiet during the rants and just listen but then get criticized for staying quiet? I was given a list of all the things about me that annoy them. They wanted the same from me. I wasn't about to go down that path. My response was when you love someone you don't try to change them if they do things that annoy you. You try to understand where they are coming from. Wrong answer. If I am in pain and am offered a medicine that I know doesn't work and say that it doesn't work and thank them for offering. Wrong answer. I should take it anyway even though I know my body and what meds do or do not work. It's increasing daily everything I do wrong so I try to stay in the background. Again wrong. I work a stressful job from home. After I work I need to have alone time. They feel that's a good time to get up in my business and force me to have conversations. I just need silence for a little while. 
I never question who's texting them or messaging them. I honestly don't care at this point. I'm also not nosey unless I'm given a reason. Just in the last month They question every notification sound that comes from my phone. I get work notifications on my phone all day and evening. I always hear what's that? Who's that? If I'm reading a work or personal email it's what are you looking at or who is that from? I've never given them any reason to question me. I have no close friends. I only communicate with family. I work from home and go nowhere. If I try to run somewhere it's never alone. 
Occasionally I may comment on someone's post on social media that I went to high school or church youth group with. That's questioned. They get agitated when they are sick and raise their voice at me or in general. I'm just losing my mind right now trying to walk on eggshells. 
Not sure what I'm looking for. Maybe just to vent. I do know I am forming a plan to get out of this situation but it won't happen until maybe the fall because of other things I need to stay for. Mainly my family needs me close by right now. I don't want to tell my family because they don't need this added stress with what they are going through. 
I'm not afraid in case that's the next question. No physical abuse. They whine day and night about everything. Gets mad if I am not hungry or don't want coffee saying I'm not allowing them joy by fixing me something but then if I do they constantly throw around how much they do for me. 
I get ordered around to do things. The other day they said get me a garbage bag. They were literally standing next to the box of bags. I had to get up from the other room and get them one. I'm getting irritated and losing my patience and sanity. But they praise themselves on how they do everything for themselves yet I'm doing most everything. Again no clue what I'm looking for but it was good to put in in writing since I have no one to share this with. ",1,1736397103.0,ToxicRelationships,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share my experience with Airbnb property management in Seattle. My husband and I started renting out our little Capitol Hill condo on Airbnb last year, and while I love hosting, it‚Äôs been a learning curve! Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what I‚Äôve learned so far, in case anyone else is thinking about diving into the world of short-term rentals:

1. **Property Management Companies Are a Lifesaver (Sometimes):** At first, I did everything myself‚Äîcleaning, guest communication, restocking supplies‚Äîyou name it. But it got overwhelming fast. That‚Äôs when I started looking into property management companies and came across **YiRental**. They specialize in Airbnb property management and focus on Seattle, which is excellent because they understand the local market really well. What I liked about YiRental is its transparency about fees and customizable packages depending on your needs. It's worth checking out if you‚Äôre new to hosting or want less stress!
2. **Seattle Regulations Are No Joke:** The city has strict rules for short-term rentals. You need a business license, and they limit how many properties you can list unless it‚Äôs your primary residence. It‚Äôs worth checking the city‚Äôs website before hosting to avoid fines.
3. **The Market Is Competitive:** Seattle is such a popular destination so many Airbnb options exist. I invested in some cozy decor to stand out and highlighted the location (we‚Äôre within walking distance of Pike Place Market!). Guests love a personal touch, so I leave a little handwritten note and some local coffee for them to enjoy.
4. **Seasonality Matters:** Summers in Seattle are crazy busy with tourists so I can charge higher rates during the warm months. Winters slow down a bit, but having a management company like YiRental helped me adjust pricing to keep the bookings coming.

If you‚Äôre thinking about using a property management company in Seattle, I recommend doing some research. While YiRental has been great for me, some friends also like Vacasa or other local options. It all depends on what you‚Äôre looking for‚Äîread reviews and compare services!

I hope this helps anyone considering Airbnb hosting in Seattle! Feel free to ask me any questions‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to help out if I can. üòä

1hx4ra5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hx4ra5/my_friend_found_an_unfortunate_method_to_cure_his/,My friend found an unfortunate method to cure his writer's block ,"If you ask anyone with a passion for writing what the best feeling in the world is, I would bet money on them saying the feeling they get when writing. But, it's not just the writing that is special. It's the beautiful feeling of putting your innermost thoughts onto a page. Being able to share a mystical world you've created in your mind. It feels vulnerable. Like you are cracking your own head open and putting it on display for anyone to see. To love, to hate, to judge. The moment you feel your thoughts just falling onto the page. It's like you're not even thinking about it. It just somehow falls in place and makes a coherent story that you've put everything into. It's unlike any drug or any other high. The feeling of ideas flowing. Creativity. That is everything to a writer. So, what is the worst feeling in the world for a writer then? I bet that isn't a hard question for anyone. Writer's block. Few things feel worse when you are a writer.



What do you think happens when a writer gets writer's block? It's the complete opposite feeling. Not having any ideas in your head to escape to throughout the day can feel like hell. It's like the drug has been taken from you but you can just get more by buying some. It's not like running to the store to grab a six-pack of beer. That dopamine is blocked until *you* have a new fresh idea. Your own flesh and bone stopping you from pleasure.¬†



That's not even taking into account the pressure from others to write and get something out that will do well.¬†



All that being said, I am here to talk to you all about what happens when a writer is *desperate* for an idea and the lengths they will go to for an idea.¬†



My good friend Thomas went missing last week. He was a writer who found a way around his writer's block through very unconditional methods that led to his disappearance.¬†



To do this whole situation justice, I need to go back. Way back to when I met Thomas.



The two of us met in our junior year of college in a writing class. We were both put in a writing group with three other people. We both had an amazing time with the class and the writing group.¬†



I always knew the reason I enjoyed it so much was *because* of Thomas. After we finished the class, the two of us continued to meet up and help each other out with our writing projects or bounce ideas off of one another. Even on days we just wanted to hang out and play video games or something, it would always end up with us talking about our writing projects. Short stories, screenplays, books, all of it.



Thomas felt like an absolute machine when it came to stories. For the most part, I felt like I could keep up with him, but the guy always had some new idea to tell me about. I've never met someone who has my style of writing like him.¬†



We both liked writing in many different styles. I don't think I have a favorite genre but without a doubt, Thomas liked writing horror the most.¬†



I think people make a lot of assumptions when someone writes horror. Especially if they are a *good* horror writer. They must be really messed up in the head to come up with such terrifying ideas. A murderer, a psychopath, a deeply disturbed individual. The truth is that couldn't be farther from who Thomas was. One of the kindest, gentlest people you'd ever meet.¬†¬†



I remember when he started to act strange. We were at a house party with maybe fifteen old friends from college. I saw Thomas being quiet in the corner. Now, to the average person, this probably looked like normal behavior for him. He wasn't a big party person. Whenever I did convince him to come to one with my extraverted-ass, he would prefer to just observe everyone else and I would do all the talking for him. He said that watching people in conversation helped him with his writing.¬†



That being said, I could tell he was off. He was looking down and just seemed empty‚Ä¶



After knowing him for so long I swore I could tell when he was in his own imaginary world. I could see the gears turning in his head and I'd get so excited to hear all about his new idea later.¬†



I should've gone up to him at that moment. Instead, I just stood at the beer pong table like a damn idiot. There were so many moments when I could've gone over to him to talk, but I didn't. Thomas has never been one to talk about feelings but that doesn't excuse me from not wanting to try. I'm not a guy big on feelings either but I don't try and actively avoid it. The mix of loud music, alcohol, and pretty girls definitely made it hard for me to talk to my buddy about how he felt.¬†



That night ended with him giving me and a few other guys a ride home. He was normally our DD for nights like this. He always said he didn't want a clouded-up head just in case he got an idea. Some might say a shot or two would only help, but not Thomas. He wasn't a religious guy, he just always wanted to be ready for an idea. It was his whole life. Always escaping into his own little world of make-believe and fantasy. It was always more fun to him than the real world.¬†



I sometimes felt like the only reason he wanted to be my friend was because I helped give him ideas to escape into. Sure sometimes we‚Äôd watch a football game or go to a party, but ugh, I don't know. I guess sometimes I felt used. I would push off those thoughts when they pierced my brain because I didn't know if I was using him too. Would I even be his friend if he wasn't a good writer?¬†



I guess we pick our friends for a reason right? Similar hobbies or interests? Maybe we did use each other for our own personal gain, but is it all that bad if we are *both* doing it?¬†



Sorry, I went on a bit of a side tangent there, I'm still processing so much.



Anyway, back to that night after the party.

I was the last person he needed to drop off that night. As he pulled up to my house he said goodbye but I got the courage to ask him if he was okay.



‚ÄúHey man, you good?‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah, just tired‚Äù he murmured without looking up.



‚ÄúOkay, well are we still good to meet up tomorrow for lunch?‚Äù I asked, accepting that to perk him up.¬†



‚ÄúOh, about that, I think I'm actually busy tomorrow, sorry.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat do you mean busy? It's Saturday. What else could you possibly want to do other than talk about our projects?¬†



‚ÄúYou know I have other things I need to do sometimes right?‚Äù he responded with annoyance.



‚ÄúDamn dude, chill. I'm just trying to help. We can just skip this week's meeting okay?‚Äù I said, trying to make eye contact.



‚ÄúYeah fine,‚Äù he whispered while facing his body farther from mine.



I got out of the car and he raced off. As I got into my room I felt so annoyed. It felt like he blew me off. I had projects that needed to be worked on. I needed his help and input on things. I knew if it was the other way around he'd be pissed off.¬†



As the morning came along, I started to cool down. If he needed space I should give it to him. Maybe I needed a break too.



The week went by without me hearing from him. It wasn't that out of the ordinary to go a week without hearing from him but after the way he was acting, I was definitely anxious to see him again.¬†



We typically hung out on Saturday afternoon so I texted him on Friday to make sure we were still good to meet up. He gave me a few excuses for why he couldn't meet but I convinced him.



As we met up at our normal place I saw him walk in as I sat at the table. I've never seen him so lifeless. His hair was greasy and his clothes were unkempt. I saw his red eyes and the bags underneath them to match from the other side of the room.¬†



He made eye contact with me and put on the fakest smile I have ever seen in my life.¬†



He walked to the table and sat down with way too much fake enthusiasm.¬†¬†



‚ÄúHey Jake sorry I've been so busy. I want to hear the progress you've made and what new stuff you have going on!‚Äù Thomas stated with Inauthentic cheer.¬†



I paused and squinted my eyes at him. Waiting for it to be a joke or something. Normally I have to fight him to talk about myself but now he is telling me to go first?



‚ÄúUm, no worries. You needed some space. I can respect that. But can I ask again if everything is okay? You can go first if you want, I really don't mind.‚Äù I said but was met with the still-lasting plastic smile of my friend.



‚ÄúPlease, you go,‚Äù Thomas said through his teeth while his smile was starting to break and the tone of voice was flat.¬†



I didn't want to keep pushing him. Him sitting and listening to me talk was way better than him storming out because he didn't want to talk first.



I started to tell him what I was working on and showed him some mock-ups I had. I must've talked for an hour straight without interruptions. That was unheard of from him. We would always bounce back and forth, sometimes interrupting each other with ideas. It never felt rude. It's just how we talked.¬†



In the hour of my talking, I left so many spaces for him to resound to me or give input. The conversation was so bare and boring like an awkward first date where I'm doing all the talking.¬†



For the first time in our whole friendship, I ran out of things to say.



‚ÄúAlright, I appreciate you giving me space to talk but I'd love to hear what you have going on,‚Äù I said with hope but was only met with glossy eyes looking back at mine. He sat frozen looking at me. Looking like he was going to talk but sat for a good minute before responding to me.



‚ÄúWell, this was nice. Thanks for meeting up with me. I think I should get going.‚Äù He said while pushing himself back in his chair to stand up.¬†



‚ÄúThomas please stay and tell me what is going on‚Ä¶please,‚Äù I begged him while he fought the urge to leave that restaurant.¬†



Without making eye contact he slowly sat back down. We sat in silence as I waited for him to speak up. I was only met with brief glimpses that held embarrassment and shame. I started to get even more worried but he finally spoke up.



‚ÄúOkay fine I'll talk, but please don't tell anyone else what I‚Äôm about to tell you.‚Äù Thomas managed to say to me while looking at his shoes.¬†



I was prepared for him to tell me he killed someone with the way he was talking and acting. I dug my fingernails into the side of my thigh to prepare myself to not react to whatever wild thing was about to come out of his mouth.¬†



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I have writer's block.‚Äù He whispered with guilt.¬†



‚ÄúWait, what? Writer's block? You scared me!‚Äù I said with relief.



‚ÄúSeriously? I thought of all the people you would get it,‚Äù he said with frustration finally meeting my eyeline.¬†



‚ÄúNo, that's not what I met, I was just trying to say-‚Äù I replied as I got interrupted.



‚ÄúThis isn't just a case of writer's block. This is something so much worse. I have nothing. Nada! That isn't me. I have no place in my mind to escape. No on-going stories I can add to during the day. When I sit down at my desk every night to write I just stare at the screen, mindless. Sometimes sure, I feel stuck or a little lost. Maybe I need some time to map a storyline out. But do you know what I do when that happens? I move on to another story. Or work on a character or‚Ä¶I don't know. I work on *something,* but I have nothing. Nothing at all. My mind is blank. No ideas.‚Äù He sat for a moment thinking. I gave him the space that he needed until he gathered his thoughts ‚ÄúI am nothing if I don't have my ability to create‚Äù He admitted with a deep breath.¬†



‚ÄúListen, this will pass. I promise. Every single writer loses inspiration at some point. You will find a spark again. You just need to push through it. Go on a trip, get away, go do something new.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou don't understand. I've tried everything I can. I feel so empty.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúCome on! I know you got this. How about we go do something fun tomorrow? Maybe you need to stop trying to get an idea. That's how we've gotten some of our best stories, right? While messing around doing something dumb?‚Äù I said as I saw a slight glimmer of hope in his smile.



‚ÄúYeah okay. Let's give it a shot. Why not, I've got nothing left to lose.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúGreat, pick me up at noon tomorrow and we can go ride roller coasters or something?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúSure, I can do that.‚Äù He remarked as I saw the tiniest bit of the old Thomas start to peak through his hard new shell.



That next day, everything started to fall apart.



I was spending the morning just hanging out around my house. Not really watching the time or anything. I was just walking through my kitchen when I glanced at the clock on my oven ‚Äò1:03‚Äô I read as my heart sank. I looked at my phone praying that I had a notification from him saying he was going to be late but I was met with an even worse message.



*‚ÄòOn my way over‚Äô Sent at 11:45.*¬†



The pit in my stomach only deepened as I read the sent time. I thought he just bailed on me, I never imagined something happened to him.



I tried to call him over and over again but his phone went straight to voicemail. I tried to get in contact with other people he knew but didn't have many of their contacts. After what felt like an eternity I got a text from him.¬†



*‚ÄúI‚Äôm at the Newbridge hospital room 501, get here asap.‚Äù*¬†



I jumped in my car and got there as fast as I could.¬†



I finally made it to the hospital. Unsure what I was going to see when I got to his room. It was a good sign that he was the one to text me, but why was he so vague?¬†



The room I entered was filled with the sound of a loud clicking keyboard and a focused Thomas. He had a large bandage on his left forearm with many cuts and bruises covering his whole body.¬†



‚ÄúTom? Oh my gosh, what happened?‚Äù I said in shock but was only met with a bright glowing smile from my very happy friend.



‚ÄúThe best thing ever. That's what happened!‚Äù He replied giddy as a little kid.¬†



‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? Did you crash your car on your way over? How badly are you hurt?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúStop, stop. None of that matters. I'm fine. What really matters is that I got a story Idea. That's what I'm typing up now. Oh man, I feel so alive right now!‚Äù He proclaimed as he passionately typed on his laptop.¬†



‚ÄúWhat? That's awesome, how did you get an idea yesterday?‚Äù I asked as I got closer to my friend in his hospital bed. He suddenly stopped and took his eyes off his computer screen for the first time since I entered the room.



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I flipped my car.‚Äù Thomas said while folding his laptop screen to see me better¬†



‚ÄúYou.. you flipped it? Oh my gosh, are you okay?‚Äù



‚ÄúYes I'm fine, but I don't think you understand, I got my idea when I flipped my car.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúWell is your story about a car accident or something?‚Äù I said while leaning in.



‚ÄúNo that's the thing. It has nothing to do with a car. I just‚Ä¶ I don't know if I can't even explain it. My tire popped out of nowhere. My car did a complete barrel roll. I was in mid-air for maybe five seconds at most. You know how some people say their whole life flashes before their eyes when they think they are about to die? That kind of happened but it was different for me. Those five seconds felt like hours. I remember accepting the fact that I was going to die. I felt it in my bones. I gripped down on my steering wheel and closed my eyes. I thought I was going to see death but I didn't. I saw a complete storyline. A beginning, middle, and end. I saw characters, plot lines, twists, and turns. A whole beautiful story. I don't know how to explain it but when I thought I was going to die, it cured my writer's block. I can't believe that's what it took.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúThat's great man. I'm glad some good came out of it.‚Äù I smiled¬†



‚ÄúNo, no, it isn't just *some good* this is huge I feel better!‚Äù I saw something strange in him at that moment. He looked terrible. Sure, he could have looked way worse considering he flipped his freaking car but It was shocking to see all those cuts. Yet, he had such a fire behind his eyes. At what first seemed like a good passion started to feel like an obsession. Like Gollum holding the one true ring.¬†



I didn't end up staying long as some family showed up soon after me. I didn't want to overstay my welcome.¬†



Fortunately, he wasn't in the hospital for long. I met up with him in person just a couple days later because he seemed excited to talk about new projects.¬†



I was really hoping when I saw him face to face that scary look in his eye would be gone but I was sorely mistaken. I saw him and was met with not only a crazed look in his eye but more cuts and buries.¬†



He slammed down a binder and several notebooks onto the table in front of us. He didn't even look me in the eye or ask me how I was. He immediately started to run through his ideas and talk a million miles an hour. I interrupted him just minutes after he started.



‚ÄúThomas,‚Äù I said as I was met with a glair for interrupting. ‚ÄúSlow down, have you slept since you got in that car accident?‚Äù He blinked at me slowly and glanced around as if he was just coming out of a coma.¬†



‚ÄúNo, I haven't slept much really. But now that I have Ideas, I can't sleep. I don't want to lose them. I can't go back to not having ideas. I'm nothing without them.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúStop saying that.‚Äù We stared at each other blankly for what felt like forever. ‚ÄúCan you tell me how you got more injuries?‚Äù I said as he broke eye contact and tried to go back to his piles of papers on the table. ‚ÄúHey, answer me. I‚Äôm worried about you. Please talk to me.‚Äù He looked around timidly then started to whisper.¬†



‚ÄúOkay, I'll talk. After I crashed my car, I got that amazing idea. I got my first drift down in record time. It was coming together great. But I fell into a depression again after I finished it. I was hoping my writer's block curse was broken. I thought ideas would just start to magically come out of my head. However, that wasn't the case. The accident helped me come up with just that one idea. Then nothing. But then I realized. If a near-death experience gave me an idea, what if I just almost died again? And‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶it worked. I went for a swim in the ocean yesterday to clear my head and got caught in a terrible current. I gave up and started to drown when a surfer grabbed me out of the water. As I started to struggle in the water, pictures started coming into my head. Fully formed stories. I felt like I was dying but I didn't care. Something happens to me when I think I'm going to die.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúOkay, maybe you are overthinking this. What if we tried bungee jumping or something? Something a little bit more controlled?‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúNo, I tried that. I have to fully give in to death. I can't be scared. I can't do something that makes my stomach drop, I have to think I'm about to die. Maybe it's my brain's last-ditch effort to try and keep me alive. My brain knows the thing to keep me most motivated to stay alive would be to give me a story idea that I just have to write down. Little does it know it could be the thing that ultimately kills me in the end.‚Äù He said with a chuckle as he sipped his coffee.¬†



‚ÄúThomas, don't say that. This will not be how you die. I won't let you just kill yourself.‚Äù



‚ÄúFine, then you tell me how on earth am I supposed to stop doing this? I found a surefire way to come up with amazing ideas and I'm supposed to just stop?¬† I'm sure I can find a controlled way to almost die. And even if I don't, I will die doing what I love most.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúI can not believe you are just accepting this as your fate. It is selfish of you to be okay with just dying one day. Think of how me and your family will feel without you. You have to think of more than just yourself here‚Ä¶please.‚Äù I begged my friend.¬†



‚ÄúJake, I have no plans to die. I will be fine. I'm not going to just throw myself around every day trying to kill myself.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúFine, just please try and be as safe as you can be. I mean, as safe as someone purposely trying to die can be.‚Äù I said with disbelief at what just came out of my mouth.¬†



I walked away from that conversation confused and worried. My friend seemed truly happy for the first time in so, so, long but, I couldn't rest easy knowing at any minute he could be dying somewhere. I always felt like I needed to go to his house or call him just to make sure he wasn't in the middle of trying to escape death.¬†



Every time I saw him he had the best ideas he's ever had. He was also having great success with the things he was coming up with. He was making money from posting stories online and even got a book deal. I saw my friend beaming with joy. It was so hard to be happy for him. His happiness was always in the frame of his injured body. A new cast or bandage appears weekly. One day he barely had his voice left. I saw a mark around his neck where a noose had been. The man escaped a self-induced hanging, all for a short story about a magical car that people disappear into or something.¬†



My friend was fading and he was fading fast. He was a victim to himself. Addicted to almost dying and the high of ideas that came from it.¬†



He got put on suicide watch at one point. Spent a few weeks in a mental hospital. After he got out of course he just started back up again but realized he had to find methods that didn't leave obvious marks on his skin. He couldn't look like he wanted to die. To most people around him, he seemed fine. Just passionate about his writing projects, in reality, he was still almost dying multiple times a week.¬†



Maybe I should have told someone he was still *almost* killing himself. No, I definitely should have told someone. I just knew if I told someone he would just resent me and keep doing what he was doing once they let him go again.¬†



He was actually suicidal. He wasn't mentally unwell. It was the best he had ever been, his happiness just came with an extra cost and risk



I stopped asking him how he was almost killing himself. I knew he did it again when he had a sudden surge of ideas. He got really good at controlling it. He had streamlined ways of electrocution and drowning that seemed to work a lot of the time. Although, I think he was losing brain cells because of it. When I would read some of his work there would be more misspellings than usual. He seemed to have trouble with math and he never did before. He was slowly killing his brain but he didn't care.¬†



This all brings us to a few days ago. As I said at the beginning of this post, Thomas went missing a week ago. Well, most of you probably caught on already, but Thomas was found dead in his car at the bottom of a lake.



It would seem his normal ways of controlling ‚Äò*almost death‚Äô* didn't cut it for him this time. He took the two first ways he almost died and put them together. Almost dying in his car and almost dying in the water. It felt rather poetic.



After I found out my friend died I didn't know how to feel. I felt guilty for not doing more, and then I realized the second Thomas almost died the first time in that car when he was truly gone. That's when I lost my best friend. Writing went from a hobby to an obsession; an addiction. Something clicked in his head or shook out of place when that damn Subaru flipped. It took my friend and gave me something back that was unrecognizable. He couldn't live in reality anymore, he was only happy in his imaginary land that existed somewhere deep within him. A place I couldn't get to.¬†



I miss him dearly. I know he died doing what he loved but that doesn't make it hurt less.¬†



Yesterday in the midst of my grieving, I made a huge mistake. My curiosity got the better of me. Part of me wanted to see what the hype was all about, another part of me wanted to feel closer to him. So I did something dumb.¬†

I went to the same lake he was found in. I tied one end of a rope to a brick and the other end to my leg. I had a knife in my pocket and I jumped into the water.¬†



It was a small brick so I didn't sink fast, but wow was I amazed.¬†



I could feel the pressure building up in my head. My lungs desperately wanted to take a deep breath but I held back as long as I could. I reached for the knife in my pocket right after I hit the water, but it felt like a lifetime before the blade reached the rope that was pulling me to my death. I started to cut my way through with all my strength. I started to see flashing in front of my eyes. A moving picture. It was happening‚Ä¶Time was slowing, my mind was sharpening, and ideas flowing. I couldn't resist the urge to try and take a breath any longer, it felt like my body was splitting into two. One part just wanted air and the other half wanted to stay in the water and keep downloading this idea that was infiltrating my head. Even if it meant that it killed me. At that moment I wanted to live and I wanted to die.¬†



The rope broke and I swam to the top. I burst through the water and gasped for air. I got to the edge of the lake and collapsed in exhaustion. I sat looking up at the sky. My heart was pounding and my lungs felt a sense of relief with every deep breath I took.¬†



I went home to write down the idea I had and couldn't believe the feeling I had. All I wanted to do was almost die again.¬†



Now it's all I can think about. It's not even completely about getting story ideas. I wasn't really struggling with that. But when I was in that water‚Ä¶I don't even know if I can put it into words. It's like something in that water wanted me to die. Like it was taunting me to not live. My body still took over and made sure I lived, but part of me felt okay with dying.¬†¬†



I am terrified that this wasn't just the ending to Thomas, but the end of me too.¬†



I don't think writers are disturbed or messed up in the head. We aren't psychopaths or serial killers. I think we are just desperate. Desperate for that high of an idea. But please, I beg of you. Don't go looking for ideas in desperate places, because one day, those ideas will kill you.¬†¬†

1hx4qpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allahabad/comments/1hx4qpx/neet_student_problems/,NEET STUDENT PROBLEMS,"I just checked my 17 year old son (currently preparing for NEET) browsing history. Look like he isn't preparing well. I need you guys to help me in this situation because you people can understand situation better

Me (45M) have been recently watching my sons (17M) internet browsing history to see if he was studying for his NEET exam. While he was at school(one of very well known schools of our city), I got on his computer, and he forgot to close computer properly so I opened it. I was greeted by a drawing of a little, short haired girl, in the style of a seemingly comic book, as his desktop wallpaper. As I slowly moved the mouse, a random spinning logo thing had opened, and then I was greeted by a chatting application named ""Discord"". As I was about to close the application, I heard a weird sound coming through his speakers. It seemed like a person was shouting with badly functional mic.

As I opened the chat with him, I instantly saw an image of a brown haired girl, drawn in the style of his wallpaper, while holding rolling pin in one hand and some balloon like things on the other hand. Something was written on top of that wallpaper - 'Savita bhabhi'. I frankly did not know why an image like this would be sent to my son, but without thinking anything of it, I closed the application. Now that the chatting app was closed, I moved the mouse to the browser icon, and I clicked. I forgot how to see the browsing history in a web browser, so I googled it. However, as I very slowly typed ""how to see browser history of chrome"", it automatically recommended me another search option, which said ""Savita bhabhi hot smoothie"". I ignored this, as I seemingly thought nothing of it at first. After I remembered how to see the browser history, what I saw horrified me even more.

Some of them read: ""hot milf nearby"", ""Savita bhabhi adds cream to your coffee"", ""hot creampie"". I do not know what a ""Savita Bhabhi"", ""milf"" or a ""creampie"" is, but I think it is a cooking term. But, I am not sure.When i asked him about Savita bhabhi he told me that savita bhabhi has won many cooking competitions.

What does any of these mean? Is my son aiming to become a chef? I never saw him cook anything in the kitchen . Did my wife cheated on me with Sanjeev Kapoor?. This is really bad. I don't want my son to be chief. What will say to my neighbors? i m very much concerned about his mental health. we supported him and never made him feel less loved .We fulfilled all his demands even when he asks for 6000 everytime my and his mom are going out i think its for his extra tuition fees and tests that he has joined. I dont want him to become a chef. Please help me to stop my son from becoming chief. I just want him to get enrolled in GR MEDICAL COLLEGE, Karnataka

We live in Ashok nagar and he studies from physics wallah online batch namely

We tried reconciling three weeks later after running into each other. By early December She said she wanted to take space to work on herself, but didn‚Äôt know how long it would be. She told me she didn‚Äôt want me to wait but she would be open to trying again whenever she was done and even suggested monthly coffees to stay connected.

Due to miscommunication the day, she told me she wanted space, I didn‚Äôt end up bringing her home like I promised from a work event which resulted in her saying she‚Äôs done and never wants to hear from me or see me again and it‚Äôs over. I had never seen her be so cold to me, but I was still hopeful. However, I did run into her two weeks later and she basically ignored me and it was my birthday two days ago and she didn‚Äôt say anything to me. 

I know it‚Äôs done but inside I still have some little.  Hope - how do I get over this? I keep thinking if I run into her again, we‚Äôll get back together however, as things are now, she never wants anything to do with me, especially as she told me the chapter is closed. I feel extremely guilty and I‚Äôm still thinking there‚Äôs a chance. I was so tempted to reach out to her, but I didn‚Äôt to respect her boundaries. If I ever see her I will not speak to her as well as she made it clear to me she doesn‚Äôt want to.

If you vote Design #2 or #3, would you remove seating completely in the kitchen island to avoid guests facing away from guests seated in the round dining table? Also removes additional counter space that could be used for prep. Additionally, microwave in the appliance garage to the right or a microwave drawer in the kitchen island so it's facing the stove?

[Design #1: Closest to current layout with the peninsula pushed into the breakfast room.](https://preview.redd.it/tixvbq156wbe1.png?width=2652&format=png&auto=webp&s=4239072e7d9079a6c28d63d9973369a3bbc416ac)

[Design #2: A is a load bearing wall that cannot be removed and extends 55 inches from the wall. The kitchen island is located 42-50 inches from the stove.](https://preview.redd.it/qwmeqq156wbe1.png?width=2518&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c5a0dec151a45b81538b0a6ef6b11f471711439)

[Design #3: Same as Design #2 except the seating is more conversational. Keep in mind the right-most chair would have a pull-out trash below it so maybe it's a bad idea!](https://preview.redd.it/8li2fq156wbe1.png?width=2826&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b9fb66f4633fb61be146bceb2984a468713692c)

[Design #4: I got a loads of feedback on placing the kitchen island parallel to the stove. Because of the load bearing wall on the left that cannot be removed, I have to place the kitchen island at least 65 inches from the stove to allow 36 inches clearance marked by X. I prefer this layout but 65 inches doesn't sound the most functional.](https://preview.redd.it/s3ab0q156wbe1.png?width=2342&format=png&auto=webp&s=7919336db800c302a4f28b8f8f8a1c056e310868)

1hx4jsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1hx4jsq/are_cheaters_nonempathetic/,Are Cheaters Non-Empathetic?,"I‚Äôve been reflecting a lot lately after reading the post *Leave a Cheater, Gain a Life* and it made me question something about my own experience. The author was talking about how cheaters often lack empathy and never seem to feel true remorse. I can relate to that, and honestly, I was in denial for a long time about it. 

When I was pregnant, I would tell my husband that I was tired, my back hurt, and I needed his help. His response was always something like, ‚ÄúOkay, rest for 10 minutes, then start doing the work again.‚Äù I confided in friends about it, and they reassured me, saying things like, ‚ÄúHe just doesn‚Äôt understand how hard pregnancy is, he‚Äôs a man, he‚Äôll get it.‚Äù But I didn‚Äôt remember my dad ever being like that with my mom. I always felt like something was off, but I brushed it off. 

Then, when I was in the hospital after delivering our baby, I asked him to sleep with me, and he said the couch was uncomfortable, so he went home. I later found out that instead of going home to rest, he went to have coffee with a friend and then went to his own place. I was devastated. Even when he came back the next day, he wasn‚Äôt really helpful unless I directly asked him for something.

I even went to marriage counseling, and the counselor said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, men just don‚Äôt get it, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs a kind person deep down.‚Äù But no, he wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúa man.‚Äù He was just an asshole. He showed no empathy, not just towards me, but towards anyone. And that became more clear when I found out he was cheating on me. 

As painful as the discovery was, it also felt like a blessing. It was like the final piece of the puzzle, and I finally got the message. Now, I honestly believe that anyone who lacks empathy is likely hiding something, like cheating. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Could the lack of empathy be a red flag in relationships, especially when it comes to cheating?",10,1736396230.0,survivinginfidelity,4,1.0,False

1hx4jj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1hx4jj1/i_am_defeated/,I am defeated,"I have been at my job for almost 8 years.  The first 5 weren't bad.  Great supervisor, I was good at my work, liked my coworkers, etcetera.

Then my supervisor retired.  Under her replacement, suddenly my accuracy rate was determined to be well below acceptable levels and I was repeatedly reprimanded for all kinds of things.

One day I got an email saying that there was an issue with my Outlook Calendar.  We work an 8-5 so, on Fridays, at 5-5:30 I had a task set.  It was just a set of cycling ""one liners"" like, ""Friday, is that you?  I missed you."" and ""Weekend, here I come!""  I was told that it was unprofessional, interfered with scheduling, and I was ordered to remove the entries.

It wasn't too long before she found the opportunity to ""trade me"" to another team in the office.  Same cubicle block, just different responsibilities under a different supervisor.  Amazingly, I had no accuracy issues and the only discipline I got was for being ""Too jovial"" with clients (basically don't crack jokes on the phone.)

Then that supervisor lost their shit, went out on psych leave, and had to be moved to an office in another city.  It wasn't their fault, the work environment had started to turn toxic.

I go through a half dozen supervisors in a year.   While under one of them I ended up out on a 90 day psych leave.  When I returned, she wasn't my supervisor anymore and said to me in the break area, ""I'm sorry for all the things they made me do to you.""

Now I've been under a semi-permanent supervisor for the past year.  She is nice enough but can't evaluate employees for shit.  Three people have quit under her and two have been fired (for poor accuracy,)  The two of us left keep being told (for a whole year) that we're constantly on the verge of being fired for not meeting accuracy standards.  We compare notes...our conferences are IDENTICAL.  Like, copy and paste.

A couple of weeks ago we had a safety inspection.  On Monday my coworker and I were told that our ""overhead"" space in our cubicles were cluttered and unsafe and had to be cleared.  My coworker had her source materials (4 binders) in her overhead...you know, where they're supposed to be stored...  I, on the other hand, have a cabinet and then next to it is a shelf.  The shelf is to my left and is eye level when I'm SITTING.  If I were to reach out my arm, I could touch ONE item on the shelf that actually overlaps my body space.  The rest of the shelf is to the left of me.  There is no way that any of the objects except a toy car could have impacted me if it fell and it would have fallen 20"" by the time it ""crushed"" my fingers.  It contained my coffee mug collection and a few, small nick nacks.  I was told to clear it.

So now I have a SHELF with nothing on it because apparently shelves are not intended to have things placed on them.  I realized today how often I glance up at that shelf just for a moment of mental shift from the drab gray walls of my cubicle, the flickering fluorescent lights, and the mind numbing computer monitors in front of me.

Every month I'm reminded that my job could be terminated at any time due to my supervisor's personal interpretation of policy.  I've been made to remove my entries from outlook celebrating the coming weekend.  I've been made to remove my personal affects from my cubicle. I've literally been told not to be nice to customers and not to explain things like policies and contractual requirements to them.  Our office is staffed with 4 workers but is supposed to be staffed by 8 but due to non competitive wages, toxic environment, and a feigned budget crisis, they aren't able to hire more.  So 4 of us are struggling to do the work of 8 and are constantly being told we're not working fast enough and aren't being accurate enough.

And I'm trapped.  I have three household members with chronic, lifelong, genetic health issues.  They can't work full time and they can't go without medications.  So I keep clinging to my job for the medical benefits and so that we won't lose our home.  But every day those I work for crush my soul just a little bit more.",1,1736396206.0,rant,0,1.0,False
