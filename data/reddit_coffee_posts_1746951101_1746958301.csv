i‚Äôll try to make this short for you, so please read as i‚Äôll give any valuable info.

19M, smoker (2 years, parents smoked around me since i was a toddler), 83kg @ 19-21% bodyfat, 183cm. resistance training and some cardio.

family history of heart problems (father died suddenly at 55 after 3 days of warning signs, was a heavy smoker, was not in good shape. so did grandfather at nearly the same age. uncle had a stroke. possibly all smokers.)

side note: i *may* have lymphoma because ive had swollen lymph nodes on my neck and groin and shins for the past 1.5 years that are almost the size of grapes. but i never got that checked out thoroughly. i dont know if cancer could have a play in this but im just adding it here just in case.

before this happened, i spent a few days in a somewhat aggressive calorie deficit (ate 1700-2000 cals a day when my TDEE is 2700-3000), smoked like two packs a day to suppress appetite, and drank a lot of coffee for the same reason.

2 days ago, while i was done having sex i felt some really intense pain all over my abdomen, the entire area and it hurt like hell. i pressed on both sides, the left side was the one that hurt. i drove to a hospital. pain started creeping up to my lower chest.

did ECG in hospital: https://ibb.co/4w6XdspK

GP looked at it and said i have arrhythmia and that it needs to be looked at further. told me to go ER immediately. while in there, the terrible pain suddenly went away. like it wasnt even there. it lasted maybe 30-40 minutes.

at ER took another ECG: https://ibb.co/4wN9Pg6H

i heard them say something like ‚Äúatypical‚Äù followed by something else, after they heard that other than the intense pain there wasnt any other symtpoms. they did a blood test. didnt take a pic but they were relieved that troponin T levels were ‚Äúunder 4‚Äù and that it‚Äôs fine. but they told me to go to a cardiologist.

cardiologist saw how young i was, and i felt dismissed. he didnt let me talk much. he just said ‚Äúlisten, the ECG looks normal, you‚Äôre probably fine and the pain probably came from an issue with your stomach‚Äù. did an echocardiogram, said it looked fine aside from the fact that there‚Äôs a ‚Äúcommon, but to be monitored‚Äù issue with my one of my valves (i think) and implied it has been there for a long time, i told him i was at a cardiologist last year and that she didnt detect it. he didnt say anything.

he said i could exercise again. but i heard that that ECG result is normal in athletes, but that it could be (?) a danger if you have family history of heart problems and i do.

the pain only started after sexual activity, i dont think it was stomach problems because i didnt eat anything weird and i didnt have any issues on the toilet anytime in that time frame.

i still feel sudden pains that feel electric around my chest, wrist, and upper back, that come and go instantly. i dont know if thats related to my hypochondria which i suppose you‚Äôd have guessed i have by now. but it wasnt a panic attack, i wouldnt be able to drive if it was a panic attack at the time. i have a history with them.

im scared that i‚Äôve been dismissed only because of my age, that this is a misdiagnosis, should i not exercise this week and go to another cardiologist? please help.",1,1746957583.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1kjxi5w,https://i.redd.it/467udi0ml40f1.jpeg,Spread the $Kendu love!,"My first Reddit post!
I felt the need to say something about spreading the $Kendu brand name. If you have read Reddit posts from Kendu before, you know that we work both online and offline. We have a lot of amazing products under the Kendu brand, such as Kendu energy, Kendu gaming, Kendu coffee, Kendu beers etc. We also sponsor irl events and the street team has made some amazing murals! Some chads/chadettes have been putting stickers everywhere, put posters out, paid billboards (I see you EAC Marketing) or have been spreading flyers.There are so many ways to promote $Kendu! This community is such an inspiration and really stimulates everyone to work for their bags. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about what Kendu can do for you, but about what you can do for Kendu‚Äù

With 18k holders we have a large community. Everyone has their own skill set and at $Kendu we stimulate to use that skill set! For example; Akabe created a Kendu mask that you can make at home. Akabe himself is wearing his mask while making drumming videos (he‚Äôs an amazing drummer!). You Kendu anything while wearing the Kendu mask and soft shill different markets. Kendufy everything!

So think for yourself; what can YOU do for $Kendu?

I myself like to walk in nature with my dog. Can that be used to shill Kendu? YES, yes it can! I downloaded the Geocache app and now my dog and I are looking for Geocaches in our area. When found, I add a Kendu sticker and (if possible) a Kendu keychain. The next person to find that Geocache will be in luck! 

Another unexpected shill opportunity (I think) is when you go grocery shopping. I just ordered a bunch of shopping cart tokens with the Kendu logo and website. So next time I go shopping, I‚Äôll leave the token in the shopping cart!

You don‚Äôt have to go out of your way, just bring Kendu shill material wherever you go! 
I hope this inspired you to come up with ways to spread that $Kendu love yourself! 

Now get out there and have fun!

1kjxh4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/NickelAllergy/comments/1kjxh4o/this_week_convinced_me_that_i_have_snas/,This week convinced me that I have SNAS,"For the last 3 years, I‚Äôve had a variety of symptoms, the most troubling to me being my brain fog. I went through a similar journey to many of you with doctor visits, tests, diets, etc. The biggest challenge is there seem to be an infinite number of possible conditions for these common symptoms. Today, I‚Äôve concluded SNAS must be part of what‚Äôs going on.

3 years ago is when I first noticed skin rashes. Since then, I‚Äôve had the following:
* Severe skin rash from belt
* Eyes extremely puffy, seemingly from fidgeting with a high nickel screwdriver and then touching my eyes
* Persistent brain fog (haven‚Äôt felt normal since it started 3 years ago)
* Ongoing IBS-like symptoms
* Increased migraines

I tried all sorts of tests, medications, diets, etc., one of which was a strongly positive reaction to a nickel patch test. Low FODMAP diet had a decent effect but even being strict with it, it was about a 50% reduction. And that was the only thing that worked at all, and a strict low FODMAP diet just couldn‚Äôt be maintained while balancing my sanity.

I just couldn‚Äôt pin down what it was.

Last week, I‚Äôd been playing with a metal fidget toy all day while working, and at the end of the day noticed small fluid-filled bumps on my hands. I figured the fidget toy must have had nickel so I stopped using it. Between then and now, I‚Äôve had headaches almost every day, my eyes have been puffy again, and I‚Äôve felt unusually fatigued (e.g. I can‚Äôt usually nap no matter how tired I am, but multiple days this week I napped for over an hour).

Then, today, I decided to try putting a teaspoon of cacao powder in my coffee (just trying out if it would taste good). 3 hours later I got one of the worst migraines I‚Äôve had in a long time‚Äîeven 3x my typical dose of sumatriptan that normally fixes it in an hour couldn‚Äôt do it and it lasted for 7 hours along with an very upset stomach. Come to learn that cacao is quite high in nickel.

So now I need to figure out what to do with this. I had suspected SNAS years ago and loosely tried a low nickel diet, but with the lack of research and the immunologist I saw completely dismissing it, I just set it aside. I‚Äôm gonna try at least the basic vitamin C and zinc with meals and see how that goes.

Anyway just thought I‚Äôd share in case it was helpful or validating to anyone else.",1,1746957397.0,NickelAllergy,0,1.0,False
1kjxg05,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1kjxg05/i_found_a_beautiful_girl_but_but_she_was_not_only/,"I found a beautiful girl, but but she was not only dating me (Cuck POV Story)","I met Sophia at a friend‚Äôs birthday party. She had this easy laugh and a way of making you feel like you were the only person she was talking to. We hit it off right away, and I remember walking her home that night, not wanting it to end.

The first few weeks of dating were honestly some of the best I‚Äôd had in a long time. We‚Äôd meet up after work, grab drinks, wander the city, or just hang out at her place. She was spontaneous and open, and I felt like I could talk to her about anything. Early on, maybe our third or fourth date, we got into a conversation about sex and fantasies. I admitted I was into some things-cuckolding, sharing, stuff I‚Äôd never really told anyone before. She just smiled and said she liked people who were honest about what they wanted. After that, we didn‚Äôt talk about it again.¬†



But I learned little things about her‚Äîbits she dropped like breadcrumbs when she felt like it. She told me once, over wine, that she likes it rough sometimes. Of course. Most girls do‚Äîthat was how she said it, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. She said she‚Äôd had exes who were obsessed with her feet and she ""didn‚Äôt mind the attention."" She told me about a fling she had while traveling, how she loved the feeling of being desired by someone totally new, totally unconnected to her life. There was a glint in her eye when she said it‚Äînot guilt, not shame, just a quiet thrill she didn‚Äôt bother to hide.

She liked control. She liked being watched. But she never said those things outright. It was always just enough to keep me guessing‚Äîand maybe, hoping.



For weeks, it was just normal dating, nothing more.

Then, about a month in, Sophia told me we needed to talk. She looked nervous, which wasn‚Äôt like her. We were sitting on her couch when she told me she was seeing someone else, Tom, just a couple days before she met me. She hadn‚Äôt planned for it to get serious with either of us, but she liked us both and didn‚Äôt want to hide it. I remember just sitting there, not sure what to say. It was a weird feeling-part of me was surprised, maybe a little hurt, but mostly I appreciated her honesty. I told her I still wanted to see her, even if it was complicated.

After that, things shifted a bit. Sometimes she‚Äôd mention Tom, just in passing, nothing intimate. I tried to act cool about it, even though it felt strange. Over time, she started talking about him more-little things at first, like what he did for work or some story from their date. I started to get used to the idea, or at least I tried to. We never brought up my kinks again. That conversation felt like it had happened in another lifetime.

Then, one night, we were lying in bed, half-asleep, just talking about random stuff. Out of nowhere, Sophia asked how I really felt about her seeing Tom. I told her the truth: it was weird sometimes, but I liked her enough to deal with it. She was quiet for a bit, then rolled over and said, ‚ÄúYou remember that thing you told me about? The cuckolding stuff?‚Äù I nodded, suddenly wide awake. She grinned and said, ‚ÄúWhat if you watched us sometime?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I‚Äôd almost forgotten I‚Äôd ever mentioned it, and now here she was, bringing it up like it was nothing. She just smiled and said she thought it could be fun.

I barely slept that night. My mind was racing, trying to imagine what it would actually be like. We didn‚Äôt talk about it again for a few days, but it was there, hanging in the air.

A week later, she texted me late on a Friday: ‚ÄúTom‚Äôs coming over tomorrow night. You should come too.‚Äù She put a winking emoji at the end. I spent all day Saturday in a weird haze, not sure what to expect.

When I got to her place, Tom was already there. He was taller than me, seemed comfortable, and greeted me like we were just buddies. Sophia acted normal, pouring drinks, making small talk, but I could tell she was excited. There was this tension in the air that I‚Äôd never felt before.

After a while, Sophia just stood up and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to the bedroom.‚Äù Like it was nothing. My heart was pounding. Tom sat on the bed, Sophia kissed me, then kissed him, and then started undressing. She looked at me with this little smirk, then turned to Tom and pulled him into her arms. I sat in a chair by the window, hands shaking, just watching.

Just watching them together was‚Ä¶ intense. Hot, in a way I didn‚Äôt expect. Seeing her in his arms, the way she leaned into him so easily, like they‚Äôd done this before. The way she kissed him‚Äîslow at first, then deeper, hungrier. His hands were all over her, and hers didn‚Äôt hesitate either. When he pulled her down onto the bed and slid between her thighs, I could see everything. He kissed her neck, her stomach, then licked her pussy with a kind of confidence that made my chest tighten‚Äînot just with jealousy, but with something more complicated. Desire. Curiosity. Hunger.

She knelt down in front of him and undid his jeans, slow and deliberate. She pulled out his cock and held it in both hands‚Äîbig, thick, not some ridiculous pornstar size, but real. Impressive. Fuck, he had a nice cock. I couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off it. She looked up at him as she stroked him slowly, like she already knew exactly what he liked. Then she leaned in and kissed the tip, playful at first, then let her tongue trace the length of him.

But when they tried to actually have sex with me watching, it just‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt work. Tom tried to go along with it, but after a few minutes he admitted he couldn‚Äôt relax with me sitting there. He said it felt too weird, and Sophia laughed it off, saying maybe it was too much for a first try. We all ended up just talking for a while, and eventually realized how late it had gotten.

All three of us ended up sleeping in her bed that night-Sophia in the middle, me on one side, Tom on the other. I was exhausted, but my mind wouldn‚Äôt stop replaying everything that had happened. At some point in the night, I drifted off.

I woke up to the sound of whispering and soft laughter. It was dark, but I could make out Sophia and Tom, their faces close together, kissing quietly. I tried to stay still, not sure if they knew I was awake. Then Tom scooped her closer, his arm sliding around her waist, and Sophia turned her head to look at me. Her eyes met mine for a second, and I could see this mix of excitement and mischief in her gaze.

They didn‚Äôt stop. Tom started kissing her neck, his hand moving under the covers. Sophia bit her lip, still looking at me, and then she let out a soft sigh as Tom‚Äôs hand moved lower. I could hear the rustle of sheets, the slow build of their breathing, and then the unmistakable rhythm as Tom slid inside her. She kept her eyes on me for a while, her hand reaching back to hold his, her body pressed between us. I lay there, barely breathing, watching them move together in the dark, feeling everything-jealousy, excitement, confusion-all at once.

The covers slipped away, and I couldn‚Äôt help but watch as their bodies pressed together, every movement unfiltered and real. The sounds of their breathing, the soft gasps and quiet laughter, filled the space between us. Sophia‚Äôs voice, breathy and unguarded, broke through the quiet: ‚ÄúOh yes. You fuck me so good.‚Äù The words hung in the air, making the moment feel even more intimate, almost electric.

They seemed completely absorbed in each other, lost in the rhythm and the heat. Their kisses grew wilder, hands exploring, and for a moment it felt like the whole world had narrowed down to just the three of us in that room. Or maybe just them two. When they finally reached that peak together, both of them moaning, it was impossible not to feel the intensity of it-even as an outsider.

Sophia curled up between us, her breathing slowing as she drifted back to sleep. I lay awake for a long time, staring at the ceiling, trying to make sense of what just happened. There was a kind of peacefulness in the room. Sophia nestled back between us, her hair fanned out on the pillow, her hand resting lightly on Tom‚Äôs chest. I lay there, wide awake, feeling a strange mix of jealousy, awe, and something like gratitude for being allowed to witness such raw intimacy. It was a night I knew I‚Äôd never forget, no matter how things turned out.

After that night, something between us felt off. The next time Sophia and I tried to sleep together, it was awkward. She seemed distant, distracted, and I was way too in my own head, too nervous to really enjoy it. We both felt it. Afterward, we just kind of lay there in silence, and finally she said, ‚ÄúMaybe we shouldn‚Äôt do this anymore.‚Äù I agreed. It was weird, but it also felt like the right call. We decided to stop sleeping together, but said we‚Äôd try to stay friends.

She broke things off with Tom not long after that. She told me about it over coffee one afternoon, just said she wasn‚Äôt feeling it anymore. But she kept dating. She‚Äôd tell me about her new flings, sometimes even about the sex, like it was just another story to share. I tried to act cool, like I didn‚Äôt care, but honestly, it stung a little every time.

As the weeks went by, we talked less and less. Her stories got shorter, her replies slower. Sometimes she‚Äôd disappear for days, then pop up out of nowhere to tell me about some new guy she‚Äôd met or a wild night out. I kept hoping things would go back to how they were, but it never happened. Eventually, she just stopped reaching out altogether. No big goodbye, no drama-just a slow fade into silence.

A few weeks after things had really cooled off, I worked up the nerve to text her. We hadn‚Äôt seen each other in a while‚Äîjust the occasional like on Instagram or a short reply to a story‚Äîbut I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about that night. About her.

**Me:**  
*Hey‚Ä¶ this might be out of line, but I was just wondering. Do you think maybe sometime I could watch again? Like before?*

The read receipt came up almost instantly. A minute passed. Then two.

**Sophia:**  
*No. What the hell? That would be weird. We‚Äôre just friends.*

That stung more than I expected. I stared at the screen for a while, not sure what to say. But really, there was nothing to say. I got the message.",1,1746957275.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

I took the criticism gracefully, actually thanked my boss for the feedback simply because Id just been hired and needed to make a good impression, but inside my blood was boiling. 

I've been cleaning for years, both professionally and under the table. I've done housekeeping in a small community hospital as well as residential and office settings. Basically, I've cleaned it all. I've seen it all, too, but that's another story or seven. And I *know* that my first cleaning always needs to be my most meticulous. I have high standards, my personal standards are higher than any company I've worked for so I know when I clean, I clean it right. My mom was military, and if you know then you know. Anyway, my first time in is always my longest time in, I get EVERYTHING up to my standards that way I only have to maintain and then do monthly deep cleans. I have a system I've used in office and residential settings and it works beautifully. All that is to say, when I got this complaint, I knew it was a lie. It immediately set the tone moving forward. I know how cleaning companies work and I know when there's a complaint, there's typically a partial refund issued or a discount given the next cleaning. It just left a bad taste in my mouth. 

After that, I started really paying attention to their spaces and figuring out who was who. I can't tell you what any of these people actually do, but I can tell you who they are and how they conduct themselves while at work, and I feel like that says a lot about a person as a whole. 

They eat. All. Day. Long. There's one who seems to pack a lunch more often than not, but throws away anything healthy. Entire bags of mixed nuts and dried berries. Whole fruits. An unopened bottle of water. But the chip bags? The empty Starbucks cups? Countless names of restaurants on bags and wrappers and cups. Her trash can is always stuffed full. Literally stuffed. Sometimes overflowing or on the brink of it. They're all snacky but she's the worst. 

They also just...don't clean up after themselves. There's constantly dirty dishes in the sink in their break room. Spots of spilled coffee dried on the floor. The dog bed with tons of shed hair (that was pointed out to me in my interview and specifically told is not my job) and the crumbs all over the floor. They have ants. I'm sure they know. They have to know. But there's not any ant bait out. They just ..don't care. The trash in the break room was overflowing onto the floor week after week until I got passive aggressive and only gave them about a third of their trashcan liner. I always tie a knot in it so it doesn't slip down into the can, and I started tying the knot super low on the bag anytime I came in and trash was on the floor. It only took like... Maybe 3 times, but they finally stopped leaving trash in the floor. 

Their lab... Oh my God, their lab. I expect a lab that deals with wax and plaster to be pretty....plastered and waxed. It's to be expected. But the level of dirty that this location leaves their lab compared to other locations... It's diabolical that they're making dentures that go into people's mouths here. I'm sure there's some kind of sanitation procedure before they're given to the patient, I mean I know they have an autoclave... But with the way they ""maintain"" everything else, are they properly maintaining the autoclave...? I wonder every weekend how many infections these people cause. 

Oh, and they don't wash their hands. You wanna know how often I've refilled the napkin holders at the sinks in the little exam/procedure areas? 4 times. Since January. The bathrooms, yeah. I'll give them that. They wash their hands when they shit, at least. But when they're sticking their fingers into people's mouths? Nah, hand sanitizer all the way. ""But how do you know they're not refilling them their selves?"" First of all, c'mon. You see the picture I'm painting. I know you do. So do you really think they're refilling anything more than the toilet paper in their employee bathroom? No. They aren't. Second, like I said before. I've been cleaning for a long time and I have...methods. Some people would call them traps and I would call those people judgemental assholes but that's beside the point. I fold a certain corner of the top paper towel in a certain way...and I check, week after week, and it's always the same paper towels on the top of the stacks. And the stacks don't shrink very much week to week. Like I said, I've refilled them 4 times since January. 

These people just...shouldn't be dentists. They shouldn't be putting their hands into people's mouths. As a career cleaner, I can't imagine what their actual homes look like. This specific location, where this entire post comes from, is by far the worst ""professional"" space I've ever cleaned. And like I said...I cleaned at an actual hospital. The only ""worse"" one was the actual emergency room and I just don't think that counts in the same ways. Actual blood and chunks are just...a different level of shit to deal with when you're cleaning. 

The conclusions I came to about this place after a month or so were that these people truly did not care about professionalism or hygiene. The way the chairs would be clustered together, I knew they were gossipy. Snacky. They prioritize stuffing their own gullets with processed junk and then regurgitating the latest gossip over the care of their patients, and the Google reviews (specifically from the last 6 months, I wanted to be fair...) confirm that. I only just looked today because..I dunno, I guess I just wanted to see what the customer experience was like after cleaning for these people for so long. I'll have you know, there was no real satisfaction in being right, either. Truly, I just feel disgust. But... It's a good job, flexible, and works great for my family's schedule. It pays great for the hours I'm actually clocked in and working. But the time I spend thinking about this place off the clock...Lord, if I got paid for that I'd be making bank.

I'm not a morning person and slept till about 8:30. Now, the day before we discussed lunch for today and I said that I want to make lunch and then we'll also watch a movie and spend time together.

This is getting out of proportion and I was compared to my decreased brother again and I screamed I wish I was in that (pointing to thr bix with his ashes) and that he was still alive. Whenever I mess up, my brother would be brought into the conversation and compared to how perfect he is.

I have feelings of wanting to kill myself again. Was I wrong for not making an effort to get up early? Also I didn't say happy mother's day to my mom's partner which made things even worse. I have nothing against my moms partner, I literally grew up in front of her, but it's just, I feel that I can only say that to my mom.

I have feelings like I wish I didn't exist. I always find ways to screw things up. Please help me make sense of this.

We had talked a little in our university before but we started texting during easter. he was being all flirty and sending hearts and everything but i tried being friendly. nevertheless he was going very fast. suddenly he asks me out for coffee. i accept. we go out, we talk for hours and i felt like we really did hit it off. nighttime we sit at a park and we're watching memes on my phone. he starts stroking me on the back, hair, then he comes even closer to me. we laugh our asses off at stupid shit. he slowly intertwines our fingers together. i blurt out ""(guy's name) do you like me?"" hes like ""yes, a little...."" and almost kisses me. i stop him and tell him i like him too but essentially i dont know him! he says we can take things slow. he keeps holding my hand on the road and stroking my back at times and all I'm trying to do is accept his affection but not really return it back to not lead him on. he even keeps asking me if im gonna be in our uni city on the weekend so we can hang out. 
The day later i saw he was a little stiff and kinda avoiding me. i understood he felt awkward, probably due to the rejection I said. he still asks me if im gonna be here on the weekend.

Yesterday he asks me if i wanna go out on the weekend via text and i say sure. i ask him if he wanted to go see a movie (he had asked me if i wanted to go to the cinema with him before our coffee date happened and figured I'd make up for saying no to that).
Today he texts me ""Im sorry, but i have to tell you this. i felt awkward for what happened that day"". I tell him i understand and that i was sorry for making him feel that way. he tells me it's not my fault, ""im just not ready for something like that yet"". I tell him i wasn't either and wanted to be his friend, first and foremost, that he was making all the moves. He says he regretted it and ""lets stay friends"". I text him that if he wanted to stay friends and go out as friends or if he didn't wanna keep going out with me at all he should just say so. He left me on seen.
i hope he's just thinking it over and not blatantly avoiding the situation. i did everything i could to get the point across that i wanted to be slow. why would he do such a thing? any ideas? 
(note: i kept saying i might leave uni if a better major opportunity comes, but i told him that i did really want to stay. that was before the confession tho!)",2,1746955070.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I'm sure there's some kind of sanitation procedure before they're given to the patient, I mean I know they have an autoclave... But with the way they ""maintain"" everything else, are they properly maintaining the autoclave...? I wonder every weekend how many infections these people cause. 

Oh, and they don't wash their hands. You wanna know how often I've refilled the napkin holders at the sinks in the little exam/procedure areas? 4 times. Since January. The bathrooms, yeah. I'll give them that. They wash their hands when they shit, at least. But when they're sticking their fingers into people's mouths? Nah, hand sanitizer all the way. ""But how do you know they're not refilling them their selves?"" First of all, c'mon. You see the picture I'm painting. I know you do. So do you really think they're refilling anything more than the toilet paper in their employee bathroom? No. They aren't. Second, like I said before. I've been cleaning for a long time and I have...methods. Some people would call them traps and I would call those people judgemental assholes but that's beside the point. I fold a certain corner of the top paper towel in a certain way...and I check, week after week, and it's always the same paper towels on the top of the stacks. And the stacks don't shrink very much week to week. Like I said, I've refilled them 4 times since January. 

These people just...shouldn't be dentists. They shouldn't be putting their hands into people's mouths. As a career cleaner, I can't imagine what their actual homes look like. This specific location, where this entire post comes from, is by far the worst ""professional"" space I've ever cleaned. And like I said...I cleaned at an actual hospital. The only ""worse"" one was the actual emergency room and I just don't think that counts in the same ways. Actual blood and chunks are just...a different level of shit to deal with when you're cleaning. 

The conclusions I came to about this place after a month or so were that these people truly did not care about professionalism or hygiene. The way the chairs would be clustered together, I knew they were gossipy. Snacky. They prioritize stuffing their own gullets with processed junk and then regurgitating the latest gossip over the care of their patients, and the Google reviews (specifically from the last 6 months, I wanted to be fair...) confirm that. I only just looked today because..I dunno, I guess I just wanted to see what the customer experience was like after cleaning for these people for so long. I'll have you know, there was no real satisfaction in being right, either. Truly, I just feel disgust. But... It's a good job, flexible, and works great for my family's schedule. It pays great for the hours I'm actually clocked in and working. But the time I spend thinking about this place off the clock...Lord, if I got paid for that I'd be making bank. 

I want to share what location this is, but at the same time I'm kinda afraid to. One, because this is my main account and there's already enough identifying information here if someone really dug. And two, I'm not sure if there would be any kind of flack from my own employer... I will say the other locations I clean don't seem as bad. They at least clean up after themselves. But after reading some of the other posts in this sub...maybe just avoid all Aspen Dental chains. I'm sure they aren't all as bad as this one, but you truly never know.

Hey all,

I‚Äôm a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can‚Äôt help but feel empty I guess. Let‚Äôs fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I‚Äôm a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can‚Äôt sing.

I‚Äôm love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Want to come over for a drink? Not really, an online drink I suppose. Maybe we can talk about the above stuff. Some things I didn‚Äôt mention. Let me know you and you know me and we‚Äôll see where it goes.

1kjwvo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1kjwvo6/kunmingxizhoudalierhaicangshan_report/,Kunming-Xizhou-Dali-Erhai-Cangshan report,"Some practical info on our trip which I didn't come across online and hope someone finds useful:

**Paying for things**

* When you spend >200 yuan you get charged a 3% fee on Weixin or AliPay, so if you want to save that you need an alternative payment method (I used an e-wallet connected to AliPay+ with worse forex than Revolut, but ok if otherwise you have to pay an extra 3%)
* Coffee - a lot of places expect you to order online and then pick up or get it delivered, so in franchise places like Luckin Coffee, every time I ordered the person working behind the counter used their own phone to order for me and I paid them back. Very milky lattes in China, between 16-18 yuan

**Connectivity**

* Got e-sims from [trip.com](http://trip.com), and it was USD8 for a 6-day, 3GB a day connection, with VPN built-in so could access all my socials and it was a generally decent connection. You can choose from a huge variety of days (1-30) and daily data use (from 0.5-100GB per day or total 3-50GB)
* At hotels we tried to use ExpressVPN with WiFi but this was always excruciatingly slow. I also tried Let's VPN as an alternative and this was only marginally faster. In the end our [trip.com](http://trip.com) e-sim was way better. 

**Transport**

* Got Kunming-Dali-Kunming tickets on [trip.com](http://trip.com) too, one way was 145 yuan for 2nd class ticket. Ticket office registered passport details and gave us physical tickets but they were never checked. They only ever scan your passport at the entry and exit points, never on the train. Buy these in advance, both trains we took were packed in a non-peak season period.
* Downloaded the Didi app but wasn't able to link it to my non-Chinese credit card, so I used it via WeChat. The only tricky thing about this is that because WeChat is connected to my own non-Chinese number, the driver can't call you or vice versa, and at Kunming airport it was tricky to locate the driver. When you get in the car they recite the last 4 digits of your phone number to confirm it's you. We never waited long, and it was very reasonably priced. Example prices: 50 yuan from Kunming train station to Kunming airport, 70 yuan from Xizhou to Dali train station
* Kunming metro ticket machines were the only place that didn't accept my Weixin/AliPay scans (they didn't recognize my credit cards). So we had to withdraw cash, get change from the ticket booth, and use that to get tickets.

**Accommodation**

* In Kunming, we stayed at the Ramada Encore Guandu near the old Kunming train station (not Kunming nan/south). Price was \~450 yuan per night. Breakfast mostly Chinese options, at \~48 yuan per person. Didn't do that and got soy milk and Chinese pancakes instead from the stalls around. We enjoyed how local it was, with a lot of small restaurants nearby. 
* In Xizhou, we stayed at Linden Centre, a hotel in an old restored house, very atmospheric and there's a terrace at the back with an amazing view of wheat fields (and hordes of people taking pics there). Price was \~900 yuan per night including a traditional breakfast bento set, and the rooms are comfortable, with attentive service. The owners are an American couple who are very hospitable.

**Xizhou**

* Most tourists only come to Xizhou for a day trip, so go for a walk in the morning if you can. It's quiet, most shops are shuttered, and there's an interesting market with produce and live fish/poultry to wander around in. Many of the women buying or selling are wearing traditional garb and carrying baskets on their back.

**Cangshan**

* There are a few cable cars that you can take up the mountain. If you want to make a half day of it, you can go up the Zhonghe chair lift, walk across the paved Jade Cloud path, and then take the Gantong gondola back down. Or vice versa. Cost was \~120 yuan per person for entrance and cable car. They'll tell you that Jade Cloud walk is 4-5 hours, but we did it in 3 at a pretty brisk pace without stopping much for pics/breaks like most other people. 
* It can be wet and windy up there so bring some rain gear.

**Erhai Lake**

* You need a Chinese number to rent the QR code bikes which you can leave at many points along the lake. We got ours (with plastic flowers hanging from the baskets) from renters for 10 yuan per day, no deposit, just had to return them where we got them by 6.30pm the same day. It is scorching, wear sun cream!

**General observations**

* Dali is really really touristy and commercialized, with the same 10 shops repeated on every street
* The area around Yunnan university in Kunming (Wenlin jie, Wenhua jie) is very hipster: vintage stores, coffee shops, street stalls selling trinkets, stickers, cute toys
* In Kunming old town there were so many nice outdoor seating areas but we only found one place that served beer.
* Sizing - China is the only place where I've been XL!
* Public toilets are always free, and there's almost always a seat option (though the majority is squat)
* A lot of food in Yunnan is faintly mala, and the chili oil looks spicy, but in fact it's very mild compared to Thailand or Indonesia",4,1746954887.0,travelchina,3,1.0,False

We had talked a little in our university before but we started texting during easter. he was being all flirty and sending hearts and everything but i tried being friendly. nevertheless he was going very fast. suddenly he asks me out for coffee. i accept. we go out, we talk for hours and i felt like we really did hit it off. nighttime we sit at a park and we're watching memes on my phone. he starts stroking me on the back, hair, then he comes even closer to me. we laugh our asses off at stupid shit. he slowly intertwines our fingers together. i blurt out ""(guy's name) do you like me?"" hes like ""yes, a little...."" and almost kisses me. i stop him and tell him i like him too but essentially i dont know him! he says we can take things slow. he keeps holding my hand on the road and stroking my back at times and all I'm trying to do is accept his affection but not really return it back to not lead him on. he even keeps asking me if im gonna be in our uni city on the weekend so we can hang out. 
The day later i saw he was a little stiff and kinda avoiding me. i understood he felt awkward, probably due to the rejection I said. he still asks me if im gonna be here on the weekend.

Yesterday he asks me if i wanna go out on the weekend via text and i say sure. i ask him if he wanted to go see a movie (he had asked me if i wanted to go to the cinema with him before our coffee date happened and figured I'd make up for saying no to that).
Today he texts me ""Im sorry, but i have to tell you this. i felt awkward for what happened that day"". I tell him i understand and that i was sorry for making him feel that way. he tells me it's not my fault, ""im just not ready for something like that yet"". I tell him i wasn't either and wanted to be his friend, first and foremost, that he was making all the moves. He says he regretted it and ""lets stay friends"". I text him that if he wanted to stay friends and go out as friends or if he didn't wanna keep going out with me at all he should just say so. He left me on seen.
i hope he's just thinking it over and not blatantly avoiding the situation. i did everything i could to get the point across that i wanted to be slow. why would he do such a thing? any ideas? 
(note: i kept saying i might leave uni if a better major opportunity comes, but i told him that i did really want to stay. that was before the confession tho!)",1,1746954879.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

The videoclip was filmed in one shot. The camera followed a blonde boy, who was in a house in the daylight. The man put a shirt that he found on the floor (i think the shirt was light blue or white), and he went downstairs, he looked like he was in a rush, while he was lypsincing the song. He grabbed a soda can, or a coffee, from the floor and chugged it and left it there. then he went to the kitchen and i think he grabbed a knife. Then he went to the porch, it was blue, and then turned right to the garden (from the viewer's perspective, he turned to us, the porch door was left) that didn't have anything special, just grass, and he was approaching the camera or the viewers (i think with the knife) and the video ended suddenly.

‚ÄúThree months?‚Äù Evelyn stared at him, with one baby on her shoulder and one in the crib. ‚ÄúYou are going to leave for three months to play king?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to, I want to stay here, with you and the twins.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen stay with us. They need their father.‚Äù

Adam wanted to agree with her and stay, but he also knew they would nag just as badly as her, and they would both feel insulted. He was more worried about her than them. ‚ÄúI will find a solution, okay? I promise. Something we both can live with.‚Äù

She just looked at him, then handed him Wei. ‚ÄúYou better.‚Äù

He looked at the precious little one in his arms. He didn‚Äôt want to leave them, not now, not ever, but he knew he had to make the tour.

‚ÄúWhat if you guys join us? We can take one of the new ships Jork is building. Spend a week or two refitting it so it has everything we need. Then you can join us. They won't know the difference, and Hara is going too, so we've got the best doctor onboard in case something happens.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou want to go travel with two infants?‚Äù She said, looking at him, and Adam nodded.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre crazy.‚Äù She said, and he shrugged.

‚ÄúThey are infants. What if something goes wrong? We can get attacked by pirates. Hit by meteorites, or the shield can malfunction or‚Äù He looked at her and chuckled slightly.

‚ÄúAnd none of those things can happen here? We will have a military escort, and Hyd-Rin can pilot the ship. We will be safe. We can even add a small park and a swimming pool. Both boys can have a personal maid droid, and when they sleep, we get some alone time.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think they are going to sleep?‚Äù She said, and Adam looked down at the sleeping angel in his arms, then back at her.

‚ÄúPut him down then, "" she said, and he moved over to the crib where his brother slept. He gently put him inside and stood up just as Wei noticed he was not held and started to scream, which woke up his brother, who joined him in the screaming match.

They both pick up one cute little devil and comfort each other as Evelyn grinned at him. ‚ÄúYou think we ever will get peace again?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, when they are teenagers, they want to stay far away from us. When they are eighteen, we kick them out.‚Äù Adam replied

‚ÄúAnd what about the other kids? You think we will only have these two?‚Äù She replied.

Adam looked at her and then at the two screaming, adorable devils and back at her. ‚ÄúTwo is not enough?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo is not enough, but I‚Äôll give you a year before the next one comes.‚Äù She said with a wink, and Adam felt something he didn‚Äôt know how to describe. A mix of dread, joy, and anticipation. It was as if she had given him the best and worst answer at the same time, and he was looking forward to it.

‚ÄúTwo is not enough. We need a girl, too.‚Äù He replied, and she chuckled.

‚ÄúThree is not enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow many?‚Äù

She winked playfully as she gently kissed Chris's forehead and began to sing for them. He watched her, amazed. Yes, three was not enough.

Adam looked at Jork on the screen, Evelyn was taking the kids to bed.

‚ÄúSo, we take one of those cruise ships you have been making and turn it into our official royal ship. It should be able to hold 6000 passengers, but we don‚Äôt need that, so turn it into 500 apartments for guests and 200 for crew. ¬†We need a functional hospital installed as well, or Evelyn comes with the twins.¬† Expand the hangar as well for a wing of fighters for any attack, extra shielding, of course. Oh, and an indoor park. Those cruise ships have a swimming pool, right?‚Äù¬†

Jork looked up from his pad and nodded. ‚ÄúThree and two soccer fields, I can make one into a park. If I drop that many cabins, then I can fill them with a lot of stuff. What ship did you want me to make for the Hyndra people? ‚Äú

‚ÄúMercy ship, yeah, stock it up with all that is needed for a mercy ship. How many of those did you get built?‚Äù

Jork checked his pad: ‚ÄúI had Pylla take control of that project. Let's see: Five have been sent to Hyndra, and two are getting stocked. But according to Vorts, they only need four ships. They should have that planet out of the ice age and back into its tropical state within a year or two. Now, if we make an outrigger hanger, then we can park a mercy ship and a frigate inside. We can even have the outrigger detach and serve as a satellite if needed.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long will that take?‚Äù Adam asked, hoping it would be less than a month.

‚ÄúGive me three weeks with extra budget. I need to run a lot of overtime. Both Arus and Knug want those cruise ships done for their new project. I‚Äôm just glad I got so many new engineers now.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúJust out of curiosity, how many have you hired?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to know. Just know it‚Äôs a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúMore than a thousand?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think I only got hold of a thousand engineers from colony ships?‚Äù Jork laughed. ‚ÄúI will get it done, and don‚Äôt worry about it. Take care of your kids, what was it you said? Its time for some father-son time.‚Äù Then he cut the line, and Adam looked at the empty screen.

‚ÄúThat bastard‚Ä¶‚Äù ¬†Then he thought for a moment. ‚ÄúComputer, how many people are employed by the Wrangler company? Show on screen!‚Äù

He stared at the number as Evelyn came in and looked at the screen, and she smiled.

‚ÄúDid you think it would be lower than that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI came here alone and now‚Ä¶ ‚Äú He just looked at the number, as all the companies that were under the umbrella of the Wrangler Company were listed. Evelyn just smiled.

‚ÄúYeah, you're still pretty dense. ¬†Let‚Äôs watch a movie, the little ones are asleep, and I finally got some time for my husband.‚Äù

¬†Half an hour later, Evelyn was sleeping against his shoulder while Adam finished the movie she had chosen. He then gently lifted her despite her weak protests and carried her to bed. The twins were embracing each other as they slept together in their crib.

Three weeks later, they got into the yacht and flew up to the newly made royal ship, Camelot. The ship was blue and white and looked like a mix between a cruise ship and a space yacht; two hangars seemed to be attached under the ship. It was huge, and Evelyn just looked at Adam as they approached.

‚ÄúIs that our new home?‚Äù She finally said, and Adam looked at her and nodded.

‚ÄúJust for three months, then we return home for a few months, and then it's another three months. Alrus figured out we can get it all done in six trips with breaks of four months at home.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs around three years?‚Äù

Adam nodded, ‚ÄúThree years to play diplomat. A bunch of diplomats join us as well. There are so many who want in on the fun. Everybody wants us to visit their homeworld.‚Äù

‚ÄúUs?‚Äù She looked at him, surprised.

‚ÄúYeah, when they found out you were coming too, I got ten more invitations within a week.¬† You're more famous than you think.‚Äù He said, and she just stared at the ship. ‚ÄúIt better have a good coffee machine or I‚Äôm going to kill somebody.‚Äù",15,1746954493.0,HFY,3,1.0,False
1kjwrz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/1kjwrz3/i_just_watched_the_worst_movie_as_a_disabled/,I just watched the worst movie (as a disabled person),"I wanted to share something that's been on my mind lately. For context, I'm a T11/T12 paraplegic. It's been about five years since the accident that changed my life completely. Before my injury, I was really into hockey and played competitively ‚Äì losing that was tough. Eventually, I found wheelchair basketball, which has been great for me.

Recently, I watched the movie ""Me Before You."" The premise is about a caregiver for a wealthy quadriplegic man. I thought it might be relatable, but wow, it really wasn't. Honestly, it felt more like ""Reasons Why a Disabled Person Should End Their Life."" The story follows this guy who has six months to live and plans to pursue assisted suicide. His caregiver tries to show him a good life, but ultimately, he goes through with it.

This movie really messed with me. It brought back a lot of the really dark feelings I had after my injury. There's this scene where the caregiver suggests going to his favorite coffee shop in Paris, and he refuses, saying he doesn't want his good memories tainted by the reality of not fitting in his chair or dealing with inaccessible transportation. It just hit me hard ‚Äì that feeling of your life being so different and the barriers you face.

Honestly, the movie left me with the awful takeaways that life after a serious injury is just inherently worse and maybe not even worth living. Seeing the main character choose suicide at the end felt like it was being presented as a valid option. For a few days after watching it, I even had suicidal thoughts myself, feeling like a burden and unlovable.

Has anyone else with a disability watched this movie? I'm curious to hear your thoughts because, honestly, it really shook me.

Anyway, things were going well ‚Äì we were chatting about our Spotify playlists, daring each other to share the most embarrassing song on our list.

Suddenly, there's this little commotion outside the caf√©. A tiny, fluffball of a kitten is stuck in a drain, mewing its tiny heart out. I glance over at my date, and before I even know it, he's out of his chair, coat still dripping wet from the unexpected rain earlier, trying to rescue this kitten.

Now, here's the kicker: he'd mentioned briefly during our chat that he wasn‚Äôt exactly a cat person... definitely more of a dog guy, tbh. Yet, there he was, in all his slightly awkward, cat-saving glory.

After a few minutes of genuine effort (and my 'helpful commentary' ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), he manages to pull the kitten out, getting scratched in the process. But instead of whining about it, he just laughs it off and says, ""Well, that was unexpected."" Cue massive heart eyes from me, idk.

We ended up sitting back down with the kitten perched in his lap, sipping our now lukewarm coffees. It's safe to say there was definitely a second date on the cards, and maybe a few impromptu cat rescues along the way.

It started on a rainy day in McLeodganj. Not a thriller, so don‚Äôt get your hopes up. Just two guys, a boat headset, and a book. That‚Äôs the cast.

 Don‚Äôt yawn‚Äîit‚Äôs only beginning.I was soaked, despite my umbrella. Don‚Äôt ask why; I like it that way. Wrestling with the Jeep‚Äôs door‚Äîparked, as always, to make passengers suffer‚ÄîI struggled to climb in.

 Someone held the door open. Not Jesus, just a guy. I didn‚Äôt thank him. That‚Äôs just how it is. I clambered in and sat across from him.Mid-thirties, bearded, power glasses, and nose-deep in a book. A couple squeezed in beside me, oblivious to the world. Two old ladies joined him.

 The couple‚Äôs antics‚Äîuse your imagination‚Äîkept me entertained. No judgment; I‚Äôve got a dirty mind too. I slipped on my cheap  headset, blasting Savage Garden, and zoned out.The next day, same rain, same struggle. He held the door again. No words, just a nod. I noticed his book: Superfreakonomics. I‚Äôd read Freakonomics but didn‚Äôt know about the sequel. How‚Äôd I miss that? He caught my stare, smiled. I smiled back.

The Jeep filled with four beggars, their joy infectious. One sang, his voice richer than my headset‚Äôs tunes. I paused my music, closed my eyes, and listened. The trip ended, his song faded, and the boat guy got off before me. 

I headed to the caf√© by the petrol bunk for an espresso, the moody drizzle lingering.Day three, I held the door for him. 

The boat guy‚Äîyeah, I named him, consciously or not. He nodded, settled in, and dove back into his book, nearing the end. I was lost in thoughts of a new algorithm. No words, just us, sharing space. 

A friend‚Äîlet‚Äôs call her Catastrophe‚Äîjoined us, but that‚Äôs another story. Four guys piled in, one blasting cricket on his phone. Indian tradition, I guess. The trip ended, IPL mercifully did too, and I got off.

Day four, drizzling. I was first in the Jeep. Two ladies, four guys, but no boat guy. My eyes searched, but he wasn‚Äôt there. The Jeep started, and I felt a pang. Was he okay? Safe? Why did I care about a stranger? I got off, my mind spinning.Day five, same time, same place. No boat guy. I felt empty. Can a man miss another man he doesn‚Äôt know? No name, no clue, yet I cared.

 Brotherhood, maybe.As I paid the driver my 20 rupees, he handed me a book: Superfreakonomics. He spoke, but I didn‚Äôt need to understand. 

The boat guy was gone, but he‚Äôd left this. I thanked the driver, and in my mind, my friend. At home, I canceled my Amazon order, flipped through the book. No name. Nothing.

But I know his name, and so do you. The boat guy. First time I realized a man can miss a man like this. If you‚Äôre out there, Mr. Boat, DM me. Next time, we‚Äôll grab coffee, and I‚Äôll spill about Catastrophe‚Äîfor your ears only. ‚òÄÔ∏è",3,1746953474.0,Dharamshala,0,1.0,False

My partner of 8 years recently left me after a very prolonged period of stringing me along and telling me we‚Äôd make things work. He‚Äôd been having an emotional affair and was lying constantly and hiding contact with this girl, but I still kept taking him back all for this to happen. 

For some background, whilst living together he developed feelings for a girl on his course. He told me it was because he felt our relationship had been loveless for the first few months of living together. I admitted I wasn‚Äôt great, but I was just annoyed he didn‚Äôt help move into our first home together at all, didn‚Äôt really help search for a place, and then didn‚Äôt move in for the full first week I was there so I felt like he just wasn‚Äôt bothered. I know there was animosity for the first few months, but after that things got good and I thought we were both so happy to be living together. 

He then admitted to his feelings after I found stuff on his phone, he broke up with me, then we got back together nearly a year ago. Things had been really good, I lived with him again for a month, we went on dates, we communicated etc. Then, I found out he was speaking to her again but was deleting everything, this was a few months back. He begged me not to leave and promised this was it, that he would cut her off. Fast forward a few months again and I found out he‚Äôd actually met her for a coffee 1 on 1 to study. He was also planning to meet her the day I found out this after I‚Äôd left his. 

He then broke up with me again, then about 10 days later he came round to mine and we spoke about giving things another go. He promised he saw a future, I told him not to lead me on if he didn‚Äôt, but he kept insisting he wouldn‚Äôt be here if he wasn‚Äôt sure. I then met him again a few days later for dinner and he just ended things all over again. 

Now he‚Äôs being so cold and callous towards me. He keeps saying he‚Äôs felt like this for nearly 2 years now, that he doesn‚Äôt feel that way about us as a couple, and that he never gave us a genuine go because he just didn‚Äôt feel the same.

It was something he'd imagined for years‚Äîbut now that it was here, his nerves had taken over.

Lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, Oswald thought to himself, ""Hmm... I wonder if I‚Äôll be able to make any friends in high school."" His stomach churned with both anticipation and dread.

Suddenly, he glanced at the small clock on the table next to his bed‚Äîhe was already late! Panic jolted through him.

""Oh no!"" he gasped, throwing off his blanket and scrambling out of bed. He rushed to the bathroom, washed up in record time, threw on his school uniform, packed his bag, and dashed downstairs like a whirlwind.

Down in the dining room, his dad, Ralph, sat at the table, calmly sipping coffee. Breakfast was set, and a neatly packed lunchbox sat waiting.

Ralph raised an eyebrow, smirking. ‚ÄúWell, good morning, son. You‚Äôre late for school... we should get going.‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry, Dad!‚Äù Oswald said, catching his breath. ‚ÄúI guess I was still in party mode after my birthday. Slept longer than I meant to.‚Äù

Ralph sighed but gave a warm smile. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, son. Now eat up so I can drive you to school.‚Äù

Oswald dropped his bag onto a chair and wolfed down his breakfast. He gulped his coffee like it was water.

‚ÄúYou full?‚Äù Ralph asked.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Oswald said, his eyes wide with urgency. ‚ÄúBut we gotta go! It‚Äôs my first day!‚Äù

They headed to the front door, stepped outside, and Ralph opened the mansion gate. They jumped into the car and took off.

Thankfully, traffic was light, and they reached the school quickly.

Before Oswald got out, Ralph gave him a reassuring nod. ‚ÄúHave a great day, son. You‚Äôve got this.‚Äù

Oswald smiled nervously. ‚ÄúThanks, Dad,‚Äù he said before rushing toward the school building.

He ran up the stairs, trying to remember where his classroom was‚Äîbut had no idea what room number it was supposed to be. He wandered the hall, anxiety rising in his chest.

Then he spotted a teacher and hurried over.

‚ÄúExcuse me, ma‚Äôam... do you know where Room 12 is?‚Äù

She looked kindly at him. ‚ÄúOh, dear, it‚Äôs just down that hall to the right.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù Oswald said, bolting in that direction.

When he arrived at Room 12, the door creaked as he pushed it open. All eyes turned toward him‚Äîclassmates and the teacher stared. His heart skipped.

He swallowed hard and stepped inside.

‚ÄúAhem‚ÄîOswald Miller, I presume?‚Äù the teacher said. ‚ÄúYou're late.‚Äù

Oswald looked down, embarrassed. ‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm new here, and I got lost trying to find the room.‚Äù

The teacher smiled gently. ‚ÄúNo worries, Oswald. Just find your seat.‚Äù

Relieved, he walked to his desk, sat down, and placed his bag beside him, trying to catch his breath as the class began‚Äîmath was the first subject.

By lunchtime, everyone flooded into the cafeteria. Oswald followed along, quietly observing groups of friends chatting and laughing.

He spotted an open seat and approached a nearby table. ‚ÄúUm, excuse me‚Äîcan I sit here?‚Äù

A student glanced at him and replied curtly, ‚ÄúHuh? Sorry, this seat‚Äôs taken.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh... okay,‚Äù Oswald muttered, backing away.

He finally found a lone empty chair, sat down, and opened his bag. Inside was his favorite‚Äîa peanut butter and jelly sandwich, lovingly made by his dad. As he was about to take his first bite, a soft voice interrupted.

‚ÄúHi... um, sorry to bother you,‚Äù said a girl standing beside him. ‚ÄúI forgot my lunch at home. Could I maybe... have your sandwich?‚Äù

Oswald blinked in surprise. A girl? Talking to him?

He hesitated, cheeks warming, but handed the sandwich over. ‚ÄúSure. You can have it.‚Äù

Her face lit up. ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù she said, sitting beside him. Oswald stared at the table, too nervous to look her in the eyes.

She tilted her head. ‚ÄúSomething wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúW-well... it‚Äôs nothing,‚Äù he stammered.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sachie Kida,‚Äù she said cheerfully. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúO-Oswald Miller,‚Äù he replied.

‚ÄúOswald Miller?‚Äù she echoed, raising her brows. ‚ÄúThat sounds American! But you look Japanese. What‚Äôs the story?‚Äù

Oswald smiled faintly. ‚ÄúMy dad‚Äôs American. He adopted me and gave me that name.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like it,‚Äù she said with a grin. ‚ÄúIt suits you.‚Äù

Oswald blushed. ‚ÄúWell, I could say the same. You‚Äôre really... pretty.‚Äù

Sachie‚Äôs cheeks turned bright red. ‚ÄúH-hey! Stop that‚Äîyou‚Äôre embarrassing me!‚Äù

Suddenly, Oswald‚Äôs stomach growled loudly. They both laughed.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hungry!‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHere‚Äîlet‚Äôs share the sandwich. I‚Äôll give you half.‚Äù

She tore it neatly and handed one half to him.

They ate together, and Sachie smiled. ‚ÄúThis is delicious! Did you make it?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy dad made it,‚Äù Oswald said proudly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my favorite.‚Äù

Sachie looked down. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry... I shouldn‚Äôt have asked for your lunch.‚Äù

Oswald shook his head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be. You forgot your lunch, and I‚Äôm happy to share. It‚Äôs no big deal.‚Äù

She gave him a bright smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really nice, Oswald. Can we be friends?‚Äù

Oswald froze. A girl like her... wants to be friends with me?

‚ÄúY-yes! Of course!‚Äù he said, still stunned.

‚ÄúYay!‚Äù Sachie clapped softly. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt made any friends yet, so I‚Äôm really happy!‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù Oswald said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really have any friends in my neighborhood...‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Sachie asked. ‚ÄúMe neither. People always ignore me... I don‚Äôt know why.‚Äù

Oswald looked shocked. ‚ÄúWait... that happens to you, too?‚Äù

She nodded sadly. ‚ÄúYeah... it does.‚Äù

They shared a quiet, understanding moment.

Soon after, the bell rang, and everyone returned to class.

1. They would be cooking parts of a big breakfast one by one, resulting in the food sitting there on the counter and getting cold. When they took the food out to the customer, they couldn‚Äôt figure out who it is for because either they didn‚Äôt provide them with a table number or forgot to take down their name.
2.	‚Å†We saw two staff members go around asking if they are ‚Äútable 19‚Äù with food waiting to be served. One guy replied ‚ÄúI was not even given a table number ‚Äú.
3.	‚Å†The girl at the till kept taking orders with no idea how much of a backlog they already had.
4.	‚Å†One woman came up and just asked ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs my coffee?‚Äù The staff had no idea so made her coffee first and then went back to the backlog. Another woman came up and complained that they finished their food and never got their coffees.


Why am I posting this though? I have left bad reviews and good reviews where it‚Äôs warranted but never in my experience I‚Äôve had a cafe owner look me up on Facebook and send me a message in a rather threatening tone for leaving a one star review. I wasn‚Äôt the only one because there was another one star review left at the same time I did.

I wholeheartedly support small businesses but the owner‚Äôs Facebook message lacks class. I don‚Äôt believe my one star review will break their business as they claimed but another person reviewed how rude the owner is and it just makes sense

1kjwaop,https://www.reddit.com/r/AuDHDWomen/comments/1kjwaop/difficulty_making_friends/,Difficulty making friends,"I‚Äôm finding it really difficult at the moment with friends. I‚Äôm 33 late diagnosed AuDHD. Lost my couple of close long time friends over the years due to them treating me pretty poorly any time I tried to uphold boundaries.

Anyway, I‚Äôve been trying really hard for close to 3 years now to make new friends, and I‚Äôve always had this sensation of never really being on the inside of the group with work friends etc. like not left out or unliked, but never truly on the inside and doing things out of work/school or whatever. I reach out to people but get little back and often completely ignored, offer to meet people and nothing.

I kind of thought maybe knowing I am AuDHD might make things better but I also feel like I don‚Äôt really fit with the AuDHD community. I don‚Äôt seem to have the same typical interests or just want to talk about AuDHD all the time, like it‚Äôs a big part of me, but it‚Äôs not all of me? So I‚Äôve also struggled to find meaningful connections there.

This is all compounded as my family aren‚Äôt close either. I have 5 brothers and my sister died. They all live close by but in part due to being raised with neglect and emotional abuse and I think also in part due to most of my brothers being Autistic, we just don‚Äôt really have a relationship. So I kinda feel like I‚Äôm alone in the world and it sucks.

Not sure what I‚Äôm looking for here, maybe just a bit of recognition because I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs really an answer, I honestly feel like I‚Äôve tried everything and as much as I‚Äôm happy in my own company, it would be nice to have someone to talk to, go have a coffee or glass of wine with, not have to do every single thing on my own all the time.",7,1746952370.0,AuDHDWomen,4,1.0,False

* Coffee pack
* Water sort
* Ball paint 
* Color fill 

These have been some of my favorite, most played iPhone / iPad games, particularly Gardenscapes and 1010, I‚Äôve probably been playing those consistently for nearly a decade. 

I like having to strategize putting things together to clear items out, which I‚Äôm just now realizing is that common thread between all of them üòÇ

I dint really get to take a nice picture off the full cake, hopefully the top is good enough hehe

This time I had made a ‚Äúcoffee and rum cake‚Äù 
I had used rum extract for the cake itself. 
And added coffee to the cream cheese. Don‚Äôt really like Philadelphia cream cheese cuz it has a very distinct flavour so I found a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù cream cheese for the frosting.

I also tried to make a sous out of the coffe like caramel for added texture. Didn‚Äôt know how to thicken the cofffe so I added a little bit ü§è of cornstarch and it worked soo nicely and I put it between the layers.

I also tried to be fancy and make 2 toned rosettes with the souse and the frosting. It was suck a bad idea lolüò≠ i tried to cover it up by covering it up with ‚Äúinstant coffee‚Äù but it melted üíÄüíÄ and it ended up looking like I had sprinkled som ants on top hehe.
But it did have some leftover from the frosting that I used over.

Anyways, before assembling the cake I had given it a milk wash if that‚Äôs the correct term? 

This cake had a Oscar Wilde moment lol ‚ÄúIt is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances‚Äù

My mom said it wasn‚Äôt too sweet, which is a huge compliment coming from her.  So I definitely succeeded.üéâ

He knew I wanted to pursue Finance and offered his help and ‚Äúguidance‚Äù as he‚Äôs a senior associate of Corporate Finance in one of the Big 4. 

Ever since that, I‚Äôve always maintained a professional tone when conversing with him as I was aware of the abundance of paedophiles on the app (I was 17 at that time). Not long after, he moved the chat to WhatsApp because I put my phone number on the LinkedIn header (now removed) 

Fast forward to now, there have been more than five attempts to meet me in real life. Most of the time, it has been respectful but sometimes aggressive. The kind of things he said could also be considered.... Somewhat flirtatious in a way. 

Initially, I brushed it off thinking that this guy just wants a coffee chat. But over time... He keeps on asking personal things, eg relationship and my actual address.

Am I tripping, or was he genuinely wanting to have a chat with me about his career?

The empty space in front of the kitchen feels like a dining room since it's right in front of the kitchen/island as well as the size and positioning of the coffered ceiling. Before the open concept renovation, it was actually a closed off dining room with an open doorway facing the kitchen. So naturally, this is where we put our dining table.

Where we have our sofa now is only functional for us because we use the large open space in front of it as a play area for the kids/dogs. We mounted the TV above the fireplace (felt like no other option). But something feels so off. It doesn't have that 'cozy living room' feel to it. There is too much distance from the sofa to the TV and because it's mounted on top of the fireplace, it's way too high. Watching TV feels uncomfortable. 

I'm looking for other ways I can position the sofa and TV. Ideally for me, sofa should be facing the fireplace and windows. I thought about mounting the TV in that corner beside the fireplace but because we have an 80 inch TV, I feel like it would look weird.

Also, we are planning on getting a much bigger square sized coffee table.

A tale of heat, hollandaise, and emotional damage.

6:30 AM ‚Äì Pre-Shift Calm (Delusional Phase)
You show up early, knowing brunch is a warzone. You sip burnt coffee, fire up the flat top, and tell yourself: ‚ÄúIf I can get through Valentine‚Äôs Day, I can do this.‚Äù
Spoiler: you can‚Äôt.

7:15 AM ‚Äì Egg Prep Begins
You prep 200 eggs. Some for poaching. Some for scrambling. Some for boiling. You whisper, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre beautiful, don‚Äôt break,‚Äù to each egg like a desperate therapist.

Sous chef yells: ‚ÄúWE NEED MORE HOLLANDAISE.‚Äù
You: ‚ÄúWe just made two gallons!‚Äù
Sous chef: ‚ÄúWell guess what‚Äîit‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Day, and everyone wants to drown their feelings in butter.‚Äù

9:00 AM ‚Äì Tickets Start Printing... and Don‚Äôt Stop
You glance at the ticket machine. It‚Äôs printing nonstop. You‚Äôre 40 minutes behind and haven‚Äôt plated your first dish yet.

Expediter: ‚ÄúTable 6 needs an eggs Benedict, gluten-free, sauce on the side, add avocado, no meat.‚Äù
You: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just... warm sadness on toast.‚Äù

10:30 AM ‚Äì Poachpocalypse
You‚Äôre juggling 12 poached eggs at once. Two break. One slides off the plate. One comes back because the yolk‚Äôs too firm. You resist the urge to fake your own death and hide in the walk-in.

Server drops a ticket with a smile:
‚ÄúChef, this table says they're in a rush.‚Äù
You don‚Äôt scream, but it‚Äôs close.

12:00 PM ‚Äì Benedict Backlog
Every single person has ordered some version of eggs Benedict.
Your hollandaise is breaking. Your wrist is twitching. You‚Äôve said ‚ÄúBehind!‚Äù more than your own name.

You whisper to yourself: ‚ÄúAfter brunch, I will become a librarian.‚Äù
