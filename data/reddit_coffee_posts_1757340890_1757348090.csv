1nbs0eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1nbs0eh/my_deconstruction_journey/,My Deconstruction Journey,"A repost of my deconstruction journey after my husband (accidentally) doxxed my old account (boo.)

# Background

* Born to a TBM family, raised in a rural area of the Bible Belt. (Currently in my 30s. Left TSCC March of 2024.)
* No pioneer heritage, but membership goes back several generations.
* The ""golden child"" of my family. (i.e. received college education at BYU, married an RM, sealed in the Temple, had children, lived a ""fulfilling and prosperous life"" based on the metrics of the gospel.)
* There were no hidden struggles, no ""sinning"" in private, no overarching guilt or shame. I was happy to live the commandments as they were, believing in the blessings of eternity.

# Teenager

**Believing status:** *TBM. Shelved small items here and there without any concept of there even being a shelf. Paraded around by adults (members and non alike) as an example of the ideal teenager.*

* First learned of polygamy during a 7th grade history lesson on the western United States. Confronted mom at home, who confirmed. Subsequently labeled it as an ""I'll understand this in the next life"" item.
* Adored my TBM parents, but then mom had an affair and dad deep dove into depression. Experienced several years of intense familial suffering. The concept of family happiness within the church took a major hit.
* Found myself increasingly uneasy with the concept of America being favored by God above all other countries. (Was preached heavily by my family and via my local church culture.)
* Found myself disagreeing with overzealous members and practices:

Examples:

1. Seminary teacher missed his father's funeral while on his mission, deeming it the ""celestial"" choice. I could never shake how wrong that felt.
2. Publicly defied a group of stake YW leaders during Girl's Camp. (A tent flooded with rainwater and with it, ants. The leaders refused to move the group of Beehives housed inside, saying it was a trial for them to overcome. I refused their refusal, and moved the Beehives into my mostly-empty YCL tent.)
3. My parents preferred church member association over non-member association, with the belief that being LDS automatically vetted someone as a good person. (I was one of 3 active Mormons in my high school, 98% of my friends were not LDS, a good chunk of them were not religious, and they were all incredible people.)

# Late Teenage to Early Twenties

**Believing status:** *Had an incredible experience at BYU. Dated future husband (an RM) for two years before being sealed in the temple. Graduated, began working, had our first baby right before our 5-year anniversary and became a working mom before switching to full-time STAHM. Faithful, dedicated, the lightest pressure of a shelf above my head.*

* Being 2000+ miles away from family (both parents and extended members) made for more pleasant relationships. Being stuck with them for eternity became an unappealing thought.
* Found myself increasingly uncomfortable with what I would later come to know as the ""God of lost keys"" paradox.
* Began developing a desire to become more open and understanding of the LGBTQ+ community.
* Had a shocking uncovering of my own indoctrination when a close friend confided her husband's decision to leave the church: ""We're not divorcing. I don't believe Heavenly Father would want our family torn apart just because he's leaving. He's a great dad and a good person and I still love him."" (My immediate reaction was: ""Of course He wouldn't want that,"" followed by a gut-wrenching, ""I think I've always assumed a spouse leaving the church was a perfectly logical reason for divorce"".)
* Experienced requests for calling involvement beyond my willingness to contribute. (Was a new mom, still working, with a husband in an intense training program, and serving in the RS presidency). Set boundaries accordingly. RS president delivered an RS lesson testifying of the Lord's ability to magnify one's calling to do more than they are able, then afterward if I would participate in ways I'd already declined. I laughed (she was asking for 7am Saturday meetings, people) and reaffirmed my decision. Was released shortly thereafter.
* Parents became empty nesters and began backtracking on a few rock-solid ""commandments"" I'd grown up with. (TV was now fine Sundays, R-rated movies were ok as long as they were historical, caffeine had never been against the WoW, sometimes prophets can speak as fallible men, etc). The hypocrisy, earlier judgment of others who varied from our ideals, and changing values were hard to reconcile.

# Mid to Late Twenties

**Believing status:** *TBM. Full-time STAHM. Moved further east. Served in various YW and RS Presidencies; worked closely with the youth. Actively shelving more and more items with the faith of one day understanding all things while interpreting certain pieces as necessary trials that would see me stronger in the end.*

* Realized that though we were living outside the western LDS bubble, the vast majority of our associations ( friends, social gatherings, holiday celebrations, service, etc) all existed within the framework of the church. Not a part of our area's greater, more diverse community and I began feeling that lack of connection.
* Experienced an upside down worldview in 2016 when wide-ranging LDS support of Donald Trump came to light. Destroyed everything I'd ever been taught about electing good, righteous men.
* Emotions ranged from disappointment to anger as I reviewed what previous and current *For the Strength of the Youth* pamphlets taught regarding modesty, choosing friends, etc.
* Discovered husband's longstanding use of pornography, which included an entire decade of gaslighting my character and sanity.

**Note**: Further down, I divulge my current opinions on pornography and our particular situation as it stands today, but at the time of discovery, it wasn't so much my husband's viewing of pornography as it was the lying, hiding, and secrecy that came with it—which, unfortunately, was directly and deeply connected to the pain I'd experienced as a teenager in regard to the lying, hiding, and secrecy surrounding my mother's affair. My husband, aware of this trauma, regrettably capitalized on those insecurities in order to discredit any moments of almost-discovery throughout the years. Sorting through this betrayal and its subsequent emotions led to my experiencing depression (ultimately requiring a stay of SSRI's) for the first time in my life.

* Experienced a lack of both personal support and non-organizational love from our ward family (including friends serving in higher callings) after complications with the birth of our third child. Views on charity within the LDS community shifted as we received a greater outpouring of non-obligated love and support from both coworkers and members of a multi-denominational group Bible study I'd started attending.
* Became resentful of my husband's public standing irrespective of his activities in our marriage. (He still struggled with lying and hiding in ways not exclusive to porn, all the while taking the sacrament, holding callings, and overall presenting as a faithful member, loving husband, and priesthood holder to those around us.)
* Encountered several inappropriate sexual comments from a Bishop while he counseled my husband and I.

# Early Thirties

**Believing status:** *TBM but nuanced. Felt many extremist members and beliefs were coming out of the woodworks. Found their Christ and Christ-like teachings at odds with the ones I'd grown up with. Shelving items forcefully and with resentment; felt the weight and subsequent sagging and impressions of tiny cracks.*

* Moved to an ethnically and religiously diverse part of the country within a city that was very progressive. Quickly developed friendships outside of the local ward. Became resolute in my belief that the LDS church did not have a monopoly on true happiness.
* Joined a book club which sparked a long-lost love of reading. Once again became a voracious consumer of all manner of literature; repeatedly chose not to censor my reading re: uncomfortable topics, language, sexual content, etc.
* Developed an ongoing unrest with church culture vs church doctrine. Began to truly see the misogynistic treatment of women, the teachings of LDS superiority, the apologetics of doctrine today vs. policy tomorrow, the prophets being fallible men, etc.
* Embraced and actively taught opposing beliefs to my children. (Assured them their religious affiliation as adults was their own personal choice, that they were under no obligation to ever marry or raise a family, and that ""rules"" like avoiding sports or friends' birthday parties so as to not skip out on Sunday services would not be forced on them.)
* Experienced the death of a close cousin's young son and was appalled at the Bishop's message during their funeral. (My cousin was a JackMo, his mother a Nevermo, and their little boy wasn't sealed to them.) When a friend of the family (a Nevermo) gave the second eulogy, it was beautiful and bright and focused on the totality of the weight found in the love and loss of this little child. I remember thinking, ""This is what a funeral should be. She has it right. We're doing this wrong. The church is doing this wrong.""
* Purposefully avoided spiritual guidance in asking whether our family was complete. I was exhausted, I wasn't sure my marriage would outlive our personal struggles, and I wanted to resume a career outside the home. I made the very conscious decision that I was done and that I could be done simply because I wanted to be, knowing I was not asking the Lord because I did not want an opposing answer. My husband subsequently underwent a vasectomy.
* Determined that if I was pro-choice and did not want Roe v. Wade to be overturned, then I had the freedom to also consider that option for myself. (My husband was not in agreement of me aborting any future children in the event his vasectomy failed. It was a source of contention between us).
* Allowed myself to masturbate for the first time. It was done with permission from my husband as he was not in town to handle my needs. (Please note, I still find it an incredibly painful admission that I once thought it necessary to ask a man—my husband, the patriarch ""over me""—for permission to touch my own body.)

Additional info:

* Masturbation was full-on crack in my shelf. Soon after, I felt I'd reclaimed something I'd never experienced before; a source of individual and feminine autonomy that been taken from me long before I would have even known to miss its absence. This eventually broke down into varying shades of anger—anger against the church, anger against my husband.
* Masturbation doesn't produce children and, in fact, might possibly reduce the number of out-of-wedlock pregnancies if our church-aged youth were raised with approval regarding it. (There were more than a few teenage pregnancies in my family.) I certainly saw it as a way to inform more women about their own bodies—even as a TBM, I was painfully aware of how many young LDS women walk into a marriage without knowing their own anatomy. I couldn't see any true, reliable reason for teaching members to avoid it . . . and I came to the horrific conclusion that such withholding only fueled the patriarchal potency of a society where women are blindfolded to their own subjugation, cleverly encased in a cage barred with the lies of love and eternity.
* I found myself furious. Furious at the church, furious at the gross inequality and unfairness permitted within my own marriage. My husband was able to garner sexual fulfillment through his own self-handling whenever we were in a dry spell, but I wasn't. If I wanted sexual release, I had to go to him or go without. I foolishly assumed he was doing the same. I also foolishly assumed (and he regrettably admits he encouraged the idea), that my issues, not his, were at fault for our struggles in the bedroom.
* It should be noted that once my husband was open about his porn usage, our sexual life improved. (Go figure.)

# The Last Three Years

**Believing status:** *Shelf is cracking. Items are falling. I can't keep up. Questioning whether I want to.*

* Increasingly found myself disagreeing with talking points in church. Began providing comments that, while still within church teachings, gave more nuanced, non-traditional views. (RS president frequently found it necessary to trim up what I'd said.)
* Turned down several callings, both in leadership and teaching positions. Was open with my Bishop as to why.
* Grew increasingly uncomfortable that despite healthy home teachings, my children might walk away with harmful messages from their weekly church involvement.
* Believed church therapy (aka meeting with our Bishop) was not ideal for our long-term relationship goals. Husband and I both sought our own non-church affiliated therapists.
* Watched and supported friends who left the church. Experienced our first trans-friend to come out.
* Accepted the realization that I no longer believed in the law of chastity. My marriage had long suffered in many areas and divorce became a real possibility. I conceded that I had no intention or desire to refrain from sexual activities if I ever found myself in the dating world again and that marrying someone simply to satisfy that physical connection and pleasure was not only absurd, it was laughable.
* Masturbation, safe sexual exploration before marriage, living together before marriage, etc, were all things I began to wish were advocated as acceptable within the church.
* Found myself becoming more and more nuanced over pornography consumption:

Additional details:

1. It had taken years to see, let alone acknowledge, the immeasurable pain, guilt, and shame my husband had walked through since childhood regarding pornography, and longer still to consider the possibility that we had been force-fed the label of addiction by the church. My blame and anger began shifting from him toward the church's teachings and culture, though this shifting viewpoint did not belie his choices as an adult in regard to his poor treatment over the health and respect of our relationship.
2. **My views on porn today:** I do not believe the consumption of porn to be inherently wrong and consider the responsible usage of it (with the ethical producing of it) an acceptable thing to view privately and, within an relationship, consensually. I also believe in early, healthy, and safe teachings regarding its usage, the same way safe sex and safe alcohol usage should be taught.
3. **My husband's views on porn:** Everyone should have the right/choice to view it, but he is of the personal opinion that it causes more harm than good and that society forces an overcorrecting narrative that understates its easily destructive tendencies regarding relationships and sexual fulfillment. Since decreasing then ultimately stopping his usage over the years, he's found our sex life to be drastically more fulfilling (his words are night-and-day difference) and has over time began slowly reintroducing it into his life with a more measured caution.

# Beginning of 2024

**Believing status**: *I grab a ladder.*

I truly, honestly attribute the unveiling of my overfull shelf to reading. Not church history material, mind you; we're talking regular books.

After joining the book club mentioned in The Early Thirties section, the voracity of my reading was in full force. Critical thinking skills began resurfacing after a decade of devoting the majority of my mental energy to children, home, and family.

I had a sudden, piercing clarity that the church was, and had always been, extended an exemption of those skills. It was the only piece of my life where I was encouraged (even by TBM family members and leaders who nurtured my free thinking in every other aspect) to NOT use them.

For the first time in my life, I decided to pull down my shelf . . . and look.

Things fell apart very quickly.

# The Crack That Broke The Shelf

A chart listing the wives of Lorenzo Snow. That's what did it.

* Sarah Minnie Ephramina Jensen was 15 to Lorenzo Snow's 57 when they married. Despite being 21 when she had her first child, theirs was a 42-year difference.
* After having watched Keep Sweet, Pray, and Obey a few years prior, I had to admit to myself: If I judge Warren Jeffs and those of similar ilk harshly, believing what they did/are doing to be evil and wrong and deserving of the harshest eternal punishments, then I have to admit these same things happened in our church; I have to look at them and judge them the same way.

Note:

* I hadn't concerned myself with church history until this point. Perhaps it was growing up in the Bible Belt and being on the receiving end of some rather overzealous anti-Mormon tactics, but I'd done the ""dutiful"" thing and kept my knowledge limited and my sources rooted within the church. I knew general, run-of-the-mill basics (stone in the hat, treasure hunting, the Priesthood ban, varying First Vision accounts, etc etc) with their appropriate, coordinating, basic-bitch LDS responses, but I'd sadly been left unexposed to the more unknown issues that may have long ago piqued my curiosity enough to have begun the process of questioning the church's historicity years earlier.

# Decision to Leave

Before I made any lasting decisions, I had to ask myself:

* Could I be the same person outside the church as I was inside it? Could I still retain my closely-held values, the ethics and morals I believed fostered a fulfilling, socially uplifting life, without the church? Without any religion at all? Would losing a sense of Christ and/or losing my church-specific standards lead to a morally destructive place?

**Conclusion:**

I thought about it for weeks. Really, truly pondered it. And ultimately, I decided that yes, I would be the same person—the exact same person I'd cultivated and grown my entire life. The only object, physical or otherwise, that was being removed was the presence of the church.

In the end, I was me. The church was not, and had never been, me. I retained my identity and sense of self both inside and outside its boundaries.

# Actions I Took After My Decision Was Made

* Stopped wearing garments. (HALLELUJAH for tank tops and sundresses.)
* Allowed myself to curse freely. (Fucking finally.)
* Enthusiastically embraced coffee. (Mornings have never been better.)
* Tried alcohol. (A year and a half later, I still partake very sparingly.)
* DEEP dove into church history. Into church allegations. Into all the things I'd been blinded from seeing until then. (Conclusion? It's fucking all made up. The MFMC harmed hundreds of people inside the framework of its very origins and that harm has continued, spreading to millions of members worldwide today.)

# My Husband's Journey:

* He's posted on this forum before. (Hey, babe.)
* After some struggle, he's made his way out of his existential crisis and also considers himself exmo, though there's a bit of lingering cultural Mormonism.

When I told my husband I was leaving the MFMC, his entire world shifted beneath him. Years of self-repression came flooding to the surface.

There were a lot of tears. A lot of self-reflection and regret. He admitted he hadn't truly believed the church was true since his mission. He admitted he'd had his head up his ass with all the lying and hiding throughout our marriage. He admitted it was easier to ignore the pain—both mine and his—and that he actively tried to stay as non-confrontational as possible because anything outside of that was too terrifying to look at.

Note:

* He read my first post in its entirety before I published a year ago. There were more tears. (""Reading this, it's like, 'Wow, this guy was a piece of shit.' And then I have to sit here and acknowledge that that was me—I was that piece of shit.'"")

Having to accept being in a mixed-faith marriage, having to decide whether or not he loved me more than he loved his exact obedience to the church, having to confront that he might lose me and lose our family if I decided the church (and he) weren't worth it, knocked him off his axis.

Opposite to how I felt, he says his identity was 95% church, 5% him. The past year and a half have been deconstructing not only the harms of the MFMC (along with the harms of organized religion as a whole), but discovering who he is and who he wants to be and what that means for him and our family going forward.

Even now, we're not out of the woods as far as our own relationship. There's so much past hurt. So many things we still see differently or struggle to communicate on. But we're both in therapy and this is the most open and vulnerable our marriage has ever been.

# Where We Stand Today

* I left early 2024. My records were removed middle of 2025. Currently agnostic (i.e. We can't know what we don't know.)
* Husband became PIMO mid-2024. Attended church and continued serving in his bishopric calling until he was released early 2025. Currently agnostic. (i.e. There might be a higher power, but we can't possibly begin to fathom what that means.)
* We've recently requested the removal of our children's records.
* **My family**: Immediate family knows I've left, but they are not aware my records have been removed. So far, have not had any confrontation regarding my decision to walk away.
* **His family**: Immediate family knows he's left. Parents are convinced he will come back. Preaching and trying to reconvert him (specifically by his mother) has blessedly waned.
* We're both very open about our leaving and still maintain friendships and spend time with TBM friends, both local and scattered throughout the country, though we are not in contact with the general membership of our local ward.
* If it wasn't clear with our agnosticism, we currently have no plans to join or attend another church and enjoy Sundays as a beautiful second Saturday with family.

**TL;DR**: While changing values ultimately led to my deconstruction, church history itself led to my leaving in 2024 and removing my records in 2025.

So I figured I’d share my experiences & honest review of these onshore excursions that the 150 character limit descriptions didn’t accurately capture! I’m also including the restroom situation- as a small bladder girly, I hope others find it helpful for their adventures! All in all, glad we had the experiences, but moving forward, we won’t book any full day excursions unless we find reviews online beforehand to verify if it’s worth it. I realize my reviews are tad lengthy but figured I’d put it all out there! I also recognize the average age for the two week cruise is higher than what we’re used to on other cruise itineraries with Virgin, so that also impacted our overall experience. It’ll be something we keep in mind moving forward!


Port of call: Kirkwall Scotland
Excursion: Stones, Shores &
Scenic Strolls
Review: Wonderful quick excursion to see so much! Use the restroom beforehand otherwise you’ll miss out! Great excursion to visit multiple sites with some times to explore. The ring of Brodgar we had plenty of time to explore and take photos. If you stick with the tour guide, you’ll get an in depth history! Also welcome to explore your own. Stopping at the Bay of Skaill was a quick stop but plenty of time to take in the ocean breeze and enjoy the waves crashing.  Tour guide does a great job explaining Scottish history as you shuttle to and from, enjoying the gorgeous landscapes! (Sat on the left side of the shuttle and got to take in the landscapes. The right side of the shuttle got better views of the lochs). We did this excursion first thing in the AM so we had time to explore town afterwards. Plenty of shops, restaurants, cafes, whiskey to be enjoyed in town! If the craft fair is open, take a gander! The only restroom break available is during the Bay of Skaill- so the bus driver will take those who need the restroom back to paid restrooms while the rest of the groups stays to enjoy the Bay of Skaill.


Port of call: Storonway, Isle of Lewis, Scotland 
Excursion: Carloway Broch and the Isle of Lewis
Review: Bring a ski hat/ear muffs! Second windiest place if the UK. I wish I had something to cover my ears outside of my rain jacket but it was worth it. Spent more time in the shuttle than I personally care for, but it works for a lot of others. A lot of time to see the gorgeous landscapes. We sat on the right side of the shuttle & missed out on the gorgeous farms & lochs & coastal views that were better enjoyed if we were in the left side! This might vary from every tour but wanted to share that. Once arrived to the Broch, there is a restroom (£1) to use after the shuttle ride. Have the freedom to independently explore or stay with the group. I do encourage joining for the history of the Broch once inside of it. But overall exploring to see the numerous surrounding lochs, sheep, and rolling hills was the best for us. Lots of sheep 💩 so don’t wear your favorite sneakers. There’s a gift shop on site too. I will say the tweed available there was cheaper than in most stores in town. The scenic drive is filled with plentiful of Scottish history! Great 2.5 hours to begin your morning. 

Port of call: Greenock Scotland (Glasgow)
Excursion: Stirling Castle 
Review:  So we booked this two days prior to have something guaranteed for the day. We sat on the left side of the shuttle but most of what our tour guide was pointing out was on the right hand side (you’d think after 3 excursions on a shuttle we’d eventually pick the better side to sit on!). Regardless, able to take in the country side & greenery on the way to the castle & cutting through Glasgow. About an hour in the shuttle. Once at the castle, you can tour as your own with guided tours leaving every 15 mins I believe. We opted to roam independently and got to explore the vastness of the grounds that way. Restrooms are free once inside the castle grounds. The gift shop has good finds as well, and bottled water. There’s a cafe on site. The castle itself was grand and we’re glad we saw it. However, the ride back to port was more than I thought. Took a “scenic” way back to port which took ~2 hours instead of 1 hours. They pointed out areas used for the show Outlander, a famous bridge in Glasgow, lots of winding roads. So if you get car sick easily, pack a snack or buy one before getting back onto the shuttle. We were lost to board the cruise ship. So thankful it was a virgin shore excursion because we otherwise may have missed the boat!


Port of call: Belfast, Northern Ireland
Excursion: Giant's Causeway
Ranger's Tour
Review: If you want to see the water/Antrim coastal views, sit on the right side of the shuttle! If you want to see more villages/rolling hills/rock walls, sit on the left side of the shuttle. So this was a full day excursion. Overall, had a wonderful time. My only complaint/suggestion for them to improve it is to eliminate the coffee/tea/pastry break an hour into the journey, as lunch is 30 minutes away. I’m sure they added it build in a free restroom break (Ballygally Castle) for the longer time in the shuttle. There is a quick picture stop before lunch at Portaneevy Cliffs (can see the rope bridge in the distance). Very windy- ladies clip your hair up for those photo ops. No restrooms here. Afterwards, lunch is 30 minutes away at a hotel near a golf course. It’s a hearty lunch at the Royal Court Hotel (beef, gravy, potatoes, carrots, with dessert, wine, coffee/tea). Restrooms are included. There is time after eating to walk to a public access to have better views of the bay & waves crashing. Back into the shuttle for 5 minutes before stopping for a picture stop for 5 mins for some castle ruins (I forget sorrrry). Then to the Giants Causeway! Restrooms (free) to use before headed down. Excursion includes the guided tour down but you don’t have to. If you do join the group for the guided tour, you’re able to return the audio headphone set back to the tour guide so you don’t have to hold it while coming back. Steep hill down so steep hill back up. They do offer a bus for £1 each way pp for those who want it (if it was raining, I would’ve taken the bus back up too). Unfortunately only have a little bit of time to explore independently- about an hour once at the Causeway. There’s a 1.5 hour hike back available but due to time, we couldn’t. I would have skipped the coffee/tea in the beginning of this excursion to have more time to explore the causeway. Please please wear safe shoes! Watched a woman in flip flops face plant into the rocks. The rocks are slippery, even when it isn’t raining! Our tour guide was wonderful! Did not take a scenic way back to port- about an hour back to port once we left the Causeway. 


Port of call: Dublin Ireland 
Excursion: Bay Views & Irish
Brews
Reviews: I just wanted to highlight that the description states “strenuous” physical activity level. This is important. Because what happens is if someone looks past that & the 5/5 Energy level and warnings posted in the description, you’ll have the same experience my husband and I did. Instead of the “hike” as described, we went on a scenic walk for 60 minutes, that neither of our watches/oura rings registered for a walk. Unfortunately for us, a few people weren’t able to do the hike that was originally planned so our hiking guide had to make a last minute adjustment. While the cliff sides & views were stunning, it was definitely NOT a hike. A scenic, slow paced stroll at best. I wish that the initial tour guide would have taken the few people who weren’t physically able to do the hike, to do something else, so that’s the people who did read the description & warnings got what they paid for. This was by the far the most disappointing excursion of them all, that also unfortunately takes up the entirety of the port day. After the scenic stroll, we enjoyed delicious salmon & prosecco at a pub. It was enough to be lunch to be honest. Then we went to the 16th century pub as outlined in the description. It was a traditional Sunday night meal, with choice of wine/Guinness/soda. This excursion kept us FED. The Irish coffee demonstration is 1 minute long, so you sit for even longer to drink it. Then take a shuttle to Monkstown. This little neighborhood has a few restaurants (Chinese & Italian), two churches, a grocery store, pharmacy, very residential, and walking distance to the ocean. You get through it within walking 5 minutes either directions. Overall, for signing up for something that was meant to be high activity, there was a LOT of sitting, eating, drinking (not including the transportation because that’s expected & clarified in the excursion descriptions). Our tour guide was wonderful & shared a lot of great Irish history. Would not recommend this excursion for people wanting to be active, to see Ireland, & that want to be able to walk around town a smidge to wander. This excursion was our biggest let down as we looked forward to seeing the most in Ireland & hiking more intensely for the first time post surgery! But can say that I had my first Guinness inside a 16th century pub in Dublin, so that’s neat. 


Just sharing what our experiences were! Happy to clarify/answer any questions to the best of my ability. Already booked our next VV and can’t wait! ",1,1757347936.0,VirginVoyages,0,1.0,False
1nbrzc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/queerasfolk/comments/1nbrzc2/i_finished_queer_as_folk_and_this_is_my_honest/,i finished queer as folk and this is my honest opinion,"so, first of all i already knew about this series before, i often came across youtube videos with brian and justin but for some reason i never watched it, not because i wasn’t interested, but i just never sat down and thought “ok, let’s watch it”.
I want to vent about many things and i feel like this is the only active community rn (also sorry for my english, but it’s not my first language so pls have some mercy 🙏) 


Ok so, I totally loved it. This is the kind of situation where you have no expectations but end up watching something that completely changes you, that’s exactly the case.
I laughed, cried, reflected. I didn’t expect it to be so deep, especially during S1 when it was mostly just sex scenes. I think that by the end of S1 we can start to see some big changes. But first I want to talk about the characters I loved the most: yes, Brian and Justin (ofc). Even though I have a lot of opinions about other characters and storylines too, I want to focus on the main couple and their character development.

s1: Brian, a promiscuous man, doesn’t give a fuck about anything or anyone. He meets Justin, a 17yo inexperienced boy, who quickly becomes obsessed with him. I honestly don’t know how Justin  wasn’t supposed to become Brian’s main love interest, because to me it’s clear from the start that he was going to cause REAL trouble for Brian. I like that they kept it that way, even if it was problematic because he was underage. But we really need to watch it through a lot of different lenses, and also through the reality of the gay community, where most teenagers lose their virginity to older men. It’s very realistic, even though it’s sad. Brian isn’t by any means a good person, he is full of shit, but you can’t hate him. You just can’t. He is the heart of the show, so if you don’t like his character then Queer as Folk is definitely not your show.

But let’s talk about his character and why I’m one of those people who just can’t get over the ending. His whole character is very complex. Under all that sarcasm and hiding, you see a very troubled person. He shows the exact opposite reaction to everything: he is scared but shows boldness, he is insecure but shows confidence. Justin is connected to his development, and I don’t like when people say that Brian will always be like that and that making him settle down is OOC, it’s not. The whole point of his character is learning how to be loved, not staying in Babylon and continuing his promiscuous life. Even though my vision on marriage and life is very similar to his (which is why I can understand him), I can also say that his character clearly points to a totally different narrative.

When he senses Justin is sleeping with someone else, he starts being paranoid. Even though he looks calm and collected, he’s not. He immediately notices Justin taking more showers “from studying”, he is anything but nonchalant. He knows things right away, but he’s so used to hide his feelings that he just lies to himself at first. Then after the bowling night he stays up all night waiting for Justin to come home, and when he does, he ends up having an angry makeout session with him. He was angry because he realized he wasn’t Justin’s priority anymore, and he was scared as hell.

Then, in small details, you notice how he does his research to understand who it is. He starts digging into Justin’s stuff (which it isn’t the only time, he does it with the gun in S4 too) and even memorizes the tracks on Ethan’s CD. Then he looks for Ethan, offers him money, invites him for a coffee, that’s who Brian really is. He is deeply insecure, afraid of being replaced. Then when he talks with Ethan he’s sassy asf, and even offers him a job opportunity just to get all the informations he needed. Then ofc Justin shows up and those looks say everything. Brian is ALWAYS acting like he doesn’t care when in reality all the situations around him affect him more than anyone else. In the Ethan arc we see him completely desperate, in love with Justin. That’s why I didn’t understand S4 and S5, because it’s like he takes a step backward and starts having sex with everyone again. The only coherent thing would have been making Justin go to New York in S4, making Brian realize things, and then setting the whole S5 around them figuring things out. The LA plot was so unnecessary because it ended up doing literally nothing. Justin hooked up with people, Brian didn’t get past his insecurities and didn’t book a flight to visit him. So what was the point? Justin comes back and everything goes back to how it was, no development. Then he gets tired and leaves him. It’s just running in circles, when S2 and S3 were doing so well. Like, is that the same Brian who was watching romantic movies alone at home after he and Justin broke up?

Why does nobody talk about those subtle scenes? He was never against love and settling down, he was just a scared, wounded man. He even acknowledges that the cause of his problems is the fact that his parents weren’t happy in their marriage. I don’t want to sound like a know-it-all, but if they wanted to keep their relationship open, why make Justin Brian’s main love interest if their priorities were always destined to be different?
It’s obvious that they weren’t compatible, but at the same time, they were.

Brian had so much shit to unpack, but for some reason they decided to change plots and make him focus on work and go back to fucking everyone. I don’t understand, really. I don’t understand what they wanted to do with the Ethan arc. The purpose was to show us how different their priorities were, but in fact they weren’t, because Brian was really in love. I don’t know if I’m explaining myself well, this is me brainstorming, because I think they built something coherent only to screw it up later. At that point, they should have just let Brian have that same strange relationship with Michael until the end, because Justin’s purpose in his life ended up being temporary. And after all that pacing, they just end up separated.

If they weren’t destined, then their relationship should never have become so deep. Justin is an independent person and needs to grow, but then again that ending is just nonsense. At least show us or hint at Brian following Justin and finally having a mature relationship with him, leaving Pittsburgh (because that place actually makes him miserable). But nope, let’s separate them and not even hint at a possible comeback. Also, I don’t really care about what the writers say about them eventually getting back together, because if it was the initial intent, they would have shown it.

I have so many other things in my mind, but I’m bitter. And I know I’m not the first one to say this, but they had so much potential. I want to dig deeper into their characters, but there’s too much to say. I hope I was clear with what I intended, this show left me empty. I want to talk about them individually too, but I think this will get too long. Also i’m aware of the “not everyone is meant to be in our life forever because priorities change” i would agree if only Justin wasn’t extremely involved in Brian’s character development.

I am looking to get into espresso making and spend around $1000 (USD) for the machines to start. And am thinking Breville (Sage) Bambino Plus or Barista Pro.

Bambino Plus
* Pro is separate grinder and espresso machine. I know grinder is likely more important than espresso machine.
* Thinking of getting the new Baratza Encore ESP Pro ($300) that just came out since it can do espresso and coffee. If I do well with this I may get those fancy DF64 grinders later.
* Has auto steaming wand
* Con is no temperature control

Barista Pro
* Built in grinder so I would start with that
* Manual steam wand (can be pro or con)
* Bigger so more storage (pro or con)
* Rest is the same as the bambino plus, yes pro has a screen
* Pro is temperature control

The question I have - is temperature control on the espresso shot worth getting the Barista Pro? I will start with dark roast espresso but am likely to do medium roast, and maybe even light roast. The only concern I have with the bambino plus is no temperature control so I cannot raise it for light/medium roasts. But I do like how it is compact!

What would you recommend? Temperature control is worth getting the Barista Pro? Bambino Plus is okay enough for light roasts or maybe both don’t do super well with light roasts so don’t bother? Or a different compact espresso that is not that much more expensive? Thanks",1,1757347915.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I'd even like to do the binding myself if I knew what sort of printer to ask to print the pages - I asked a local printer to print pages for a recent personal project I had and the pages didn't quite line up so I know Id need a more specialist service, though I don't think I could do the ""layflat"" binding myself and that would be nice to have.

Im currently finishing my first year in uni.

Got diagnosed with ADHD back in November 2024~  and its been one hell of a ride since.

Went through every phase with the meds (I started taking them immediately)

Started with a low dosage ass ritalin LA or whatever the name than another pill yadayadayada 

The most notable was 30 mg Vyvanse, than upped to 50 mg and stopped taking them because I was suffering! Couldnt sleep for days, didnt eat, dey mouth, anxiety through the roof and even than I did everything - other than studying.

Than got prescribed 20 mg adderall and thats what I’m currently on. Oh and I have some Concerta 27mg left so if I have “day to day” errands thats what ill take considering adderall has a short term effect.

Took the same 20 mg if adderall today at around 9:00, it just didnt do shit tbh 

Than took another 10 mg at around 14:00 and another 10 at around 16:30~ish.

All didnt work so I took some Concerta 27 mg - didnt do shit as well.

Mind u - im also drinking around 4 cups of coffee and I truly think I can fully fall asleep now.

I NEED TO STUDY.

Im so done with begging for more time and another chance at taking tests because I cant sit my ass down for more than 4 seconds let alone comprehend ANYTHING written on the screen. 
 
I do have people to turn to but I hate the fact I even have to deal with this shit. Im quite a cynical and don’t really  take things to heart UNTIL its something I truly CANNN do better at and want to - so why? Whyyyy

I hate the looks and how I mask my difficulties and my friends think its all heee heee because I turn this into a joke but im panicking here 

Im 5’0 - there’s no dimension where this dosage shouldnt have some sort of effect. 

Mot even with studying - I barely managed to force myself to take a shower. Now im in workout clothes for around…5 hours. Simply because I wont get up to the gym which is 10 mins away from my house or even a fuck ass walk 😭


WHYYYY 

literally who did I torture in my previous life that I deserve this? I just want to do shit - not even do it well atp but just start without it taking 7 business daysss    


 Btw * Ive been in therapy and done w that shit as well cuz it aint helping and I’m not even doing that “well” so no thank youuuu

As I mentioned im quite cynical and straight to the point so the talks and the “wellness” bs of “taking it slowly” as if I dont have an exams in less than a week are infuriating to me and I just wont do it - i barely eat even if im starving so I could give a f less about some mystical cute whimsy solution such as 🥹take it slowly🥹 it literally stresses me out to be this passive that it makes me nauseous

As a child I was very arrogant and as a teen very very shy and socially anxious, which carried on in high school. However, during university I tried to change and to become better at socializing and making friends. I didn't have much luck, or rather I did in some respects but not others. In one way or another, I ended up making friends with a bunch of introverted people like me (prefer to be on their own and study on their own, prefer to stay home instead of hanging out, pretty much only text each other for notes/lectures and other academic stuff). That is all fine. But by being around I became the one that always took initiative, texted people, tried to arrange for us to hang out get ice cream and stuff. I got turned down often, except by a couple people who I still contact maybe once every couple months apart from when we have classes together. One of these people is a guy and I have no experience whatsoever with male friends so I don't even know what is the appropriate behaviour (like I don't want him to think that I'm into him). Anyway

I feel like these people don't like me and I have no idea why. As I said, when I started uni I really tried to get better at interacting with people and I tried treating them the way I would like to be treated. This goes for both uni friends and other friends. Like I try to always help them when I can (sharing notes from class, books, etc.), I try to encourage them when things aren't going well for them (I point out their strengths but like in a genuine way, I only ever say what I truly feel, I don't make it up just to make them feel good), I pay for food or coffee or whatever when I get the chance, I try to ask questions and genuinely listen to the answers, I crack jokes and banter with them, I ask about their interests and make mental notes about it, I remember birthdays and important dates (like before exams I usually text them good luck). And I'm not just imagining that I'm doing everything right, they tell me straight up: they tell me they enjoy hanging out with me, that I'm funny, that they seriously appreciate my support, that they are happy to have someone to share their interests with, that they'll be there for me whenever I need anything, etc. And they seem genuine. But then nobody reaches out ever, unless they need something. So I thought, maybe I'm just a boring person? Like I come across like I have nothing else going on in my life and people don't want to talk to me because of that?

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

One year and one month smoke free feels like a miracle

I smoked for 7 years and always told myself I will never be able to quit

But today it has been one year since I quit and I can finally say it with pride

It was not easy

The first days were hell my body screaming for nicotine

I tried everything you can think of nicotine patches herbs that do nothing quit smoking courses even psychologists everything

I slipped I almost gave up but every time I reminded myself no I will not go back to being a slave to cigarettes

What I learned

A craving never lasts more than ten minutes just ride it out

I've recently had some people coming in and asking me for iced espressos. I'm always puzzled by this phrasing and I tell them I can do espresso over ice a couple different ways. I can do it with milk which would be a latte or I can do it with water which would be an americano. I then go on to describe that an americano would just be like a cold cup of black coffee but made with espresso and that you can add a splash of milk to it if you'd like. Generally these people end up opting for a latte and once I had somebody tell me with extra oat milk.... extra oat milk in an oat milk latte... I wasn't quite sure how I was going to do that but I said sure anyway and just handed out and iced latte with oat milk.

That night I went home and looked up on the Starbucks app what an ice espresso is.... y'all... it is quite literally just and americano but with a quote carmely flavor... what makes me even crazier is that Starbucks also has an iced Americano on the menu... like for the love of everything can we just call the drinks by their names and stop confusing my customers. That woman didn't want a latte she wanted a freaking iced americano with extra oat milk!

TLDR: the iced espresso at Starbucks is literally just and iced Americano but with a caramely flavor.... JUST CALL IT AN AMERICANO WITH CARAMEL ",0,1757347438.0,barista,6,0.5,False

1nbro8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1nbro8b/do_my_symptoms_indicate_gallbladder_issues/,Do my symptoms indicate gallbladder issues?,"Hi all,  

I’m hoping to get some advice on whether or not my symptoms are convincingly related to the gallbladder.  

Background:  
Around one year ago I developed abdominal pain that I assumed was food poisoning. This pain then occurred again a few months later. In the last six months or so the pain has been occurring on average once per month. When the pain comes, it is extremely consistent as far as time of day. It always begins around 4pm and has lasted through the night into the following morning every time but once. I believe that it gets worse after dinner, but always seems to begin before dinner (sort of like hunger pains). The problem is I cannot identify where the pain is originating from. On different occasions it has felt like middle upper abdomen, middle lower abdomen, and maybe my right side once. In each occurrence, the whole abdomen hurts.


I visited my pcp whose working diagnoses was acid reflux and had me reduce coffee intake and to try and determine which  quadrant of the abdomen the pain originates in when it happens. A couple of weeks later the pain came again and was the worst it had been, despite caffeine reduction. Again, I cannot pinpoint the quadrant it’s coming from. 

I got an ultrasound which showed small polyps (the largest being 4mm)  in the gallbladder as well as sludge, but no stones. My PCP referred me to gen surgery with whom I’ve had one telephone call. He immediately said he’s convinced it’s the gallbladder and to take it out and said there was no other test, imaging or treatment option.

To add to all of this, I’ve developed a back pain for the last 10 days or so. This pain is in my upper back, just inside my right shoulder blade, and is very focal. It hurts on direct pressure to that site, such as when it’s massaged. It seems to be worse when doing dishes or driving for some reason. It has been (very slowly) dissipating but is more or less consistent. It might be worth noting that I have NOT had the abdominal pain at any point during this back pain, so I’m unsure if it’s coincidental or if they are related. 

For better or worse, I have quite a few doctor friends from all different specialties-hospitalists, ER, orthopedics -who are not convinced it’s the gallbladder based on the history, making things more confusing. We all went out last night for dinner where I had fried chicken and ice cream, sort of as a high-fat meal test for the gallbladder, and ended up maybe having a small flare up in the back pain, but no abdominal pain. 

My friends noted they have seen many patients who have had their gallbladder removed and their symptoms did not resolve. It was highly suggested I do more testing, such as a HIDA scan and seeing GI to rule out other causes before removing the gallbladder. I know my friends are not general surgeons, but they spent so much more time trying to understand my symptoms than any of my actual doctors. 

In case it matters: I’m a very active person (outside of my desk job) and would say that I eat rather healthy foods and am extremely consistent with my diet. 

My questions for anyone who has experienced anything like this before: does it sound like the gallbladder to you? Would you pursue any other specialties/tests before removing the gallbladder? Has anyone had their gallbladder removed but then continued to experience these symptoms?

Yeah. I know how it sounds. We didn’t believe it either—at first. We were just looking for ghosts.

We got goddamn *mythologies*.

My name’s Xavier Volkov. I’m 22, barely scraping by in a tech program in Kyiv, and I drink my weight in cold, bitter coffee just to survive midterms. My mom thinks I’m wasting my life. She's always refused to tell me about my grandfather. She's always just told me ""he got lost in the woods while on duty""—I call bs. I remember my grandfather from childhood. He drank heavy, sure, but he wasn't senile. He wouldn't just walk into the forest one day and then never come back. Not without telling anyone.

My friends call me “the serious one.” Say I obsess over his disappearance too much. They’re not wrong. I’m not the ghost-hunting type. I don’t believe in orbs or demon scratches or dolls blinking on their own. But something happened to my grandfather. Something big.

And I'll be damned if I don't figure out what it is.

And when we went into the Red Forest? I think I finally found what I've been searching for.

We weren’t looking for anything real. Just some haunted backwoods tale we could milk for YouTube. “Urban exploration.” A few laughs. Some beer, GoPros, radiation meters off eBay. You know the drill.

But what we found wasn’t a haunting.

It was a *burial*.

And a story.

A real one.

Beneath the moss and birch trees, somewhere deep in the Exclusion Zone, we found a heart-shaped coffin nestled between the roots. Inside was a woman—hair white as snow, falling past her ankles, skin pale and thin as paper, lashes thinner than spider silk. She was cradling a stag skull, but the antlers were… wrong. Blooming with flowers in colors I’ve never seen before. Impossible ones.

She wasn’t alone.

There was a man’s skeleton beside her, still wearing the remnants of a soldier’s uniform. And a black, gaunt, wolf, or maybe a dog, curled around her like it had died guarding her sleep. The worst part? His dog tags confirmed it—it was my grandfather Ivan. Or, what was left of him at least. He was holding her skeletal hand in his own. His body looked… recent. Untouched by time or rot. Like hers.

There was a journal, too. Bound in dry, red leather. The pages were yellowed and curled with age.

It was hers.

Her name was written inside the cover. *Valeska Durneva*.

And I think she’s the reason my grandfather went missing.

I’m going to share a few pages from her journal here. They're...unlike anything I've ever read before. Maybe you all can help me understand them better.

*That the corpses in the graphite zone can still burn you—even without breath.*

*That their eyes might still remember who killed them. That their mouths might still be trying to scream.*

*I look anyway.*

*I unzip the bags. One by one.*

*Some of them are still warm. Some of them fall apart in my hands like soft bread. Some of them… smell like boiled milk.*

*I try not to retch. I only do once. On the first day. I’ve trained myself since. I hum hymns through my teeth now, like a metronome.*

*I remember their faces from the buses.*

*The boys with ears still pink from winter. Hands too big for their coats. Names stitched unevenly into collars. Teeth still crooked. Some wore cologne, still hopeful someone might notice them that day. Some had chewing gum in their pockets.*

*I unzip the bags and I draw them. What’s left of them. I don’t know why.*

*My hands move before my mind speaks. I think it’s to preserve them.*

*To remind them they are not forgotten.*

*That they still matter.*

*To me, at the very least.*

*I sketch the curvature of burned eyelids. The shape of their hands, even when the fingers are missing. I mark every scar, every freckle. Every bruise. I try to make them beautiful again.*

*They told us we’d be issued respirators. That we’d be given clean gloves and proper gear.*

*Instead I was given gloves with holes in the palms, a clipboard, and a blank ledger.*

*The scarf I wear was mine from childhood. I soaked it in vinegar, as they said.*

*It smells like rot and wine now.*

*So do I.*

*The air in the Red Forest is strange—too still.*

*The birds stopped singing sometime after midnight. Now there’s only a hum.*

*Low. Constant. Almost like a prayer spoken by the trees.*

*The needles on the pines are turning red, but no one seems to be looking up.*

*I sleep behind the morgue, where the concrete doesn’t creak.*

*The lights flicker when I say my rosary. I think the electricity can hear me.*

*They’ve started calling me an angel.*

*They said it when I pulled three men out of the ashes and laid them down like saints—palms up, eyes closed, lips wiped clean with iodine-soaked gauze. I folded their arms and kissed the air above each brow.*

*One of the soldiers said, “The Angel of Ash has come.”*

*I didn’t correct him.*

*I like it.*

*Saving them feels… holy.*

*I don’t believe the Lord lives here anymore.*

*But I do.*

*And I will write everything He has abandoned.*

*Let this be my scripture. Let this be remembered. Let no eyes find it but mine.*

*Please, Lord. Or whoever is still listening.*

*I am not afraid to burn.""*

I read that first page in the dark.

Sitting on a stump.

Breathing through my sleeve because I cracked the coffin open without a mask.

I didn’t understand what I was holding. Not yet.

But I knew this:

No one writes like that unless they saw something the rest of us weren’t meant to.

Or maybe—something that wanted to be seen.

I’ll post the next entry tomorrow.

There’s more. A lot more.

And if I don’t post again, just know:

I’ve started hearing something.

A hum. Quiet, steady.

Like a heartbeat I can’t ignore.

Or maybe one I don’t want to.

The forest is calling.

I think she’s waiting for me.

I don’t know if this journal, her or even this damn forest holds answers about my grandfather's death.

But I'm not leaving without them. There's something about this place. I don't know what it is yet.

Just...I feel like I'm meant to be here. My friends don't understand. They're worried. Tried to convince me to go back home with them. But I can't. I won't. Not yet. I'm going to sleep out here tonight.

Is it weird a radioactive forest feels more like home than my mom's house ever did? Whatever. It's late. I'm off to bed. I'll post another update soon.

1nbrfyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1nbrfyq/discover_if_the_best_espresso_maker_by_imusa/,Discover if the best espresso maker by Imusa lives up to the hype,"Testing out the Imusa GAU-18234 espresso maker has transformed my morning coffee routine in ways I didn’t anticipate. When I first unboxed it, the sleek black exterior paired with the brown-tinted Tritan carafe immediately stood out. It didn’t feel overly heavy, yet the cast aluminum base added a reassuring weight to the build. As a coffee enthusiast, I’m always looking for a machine that balances practicality with design, and this one seemed to tick a lot of those boxes from the start. Spoiler: it’s not flawless, but it’s close.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The espresso maker’s stylish and modern appearance turned out to be a delightful addition to my countertop. Its compact size (7.1”D x 4.72”W x 9.3”H) means it doesn’t hog space, which was a huge win for me considering the limited room in my kitchen. The detachable base is an underrated feature, both for convenience and for safety. I loved how easy it was to pop off the carafe without worrying about accidental spills. Plus, the cool-touch handle made transporting freshly brewed espresso painless, even when I was half-awake during early mornings. However, while the cast aluminum base is durable, a bit more attention could have been given to the carafe lid; it feels somewhat flimsy to me.

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this machine is almost embarrassingly easy. With its simple on/off switch and visual brewing indicator, I didn’t need to decode a manual or guess my way through. Filling the water tank, scooping in your favorite ground coffee, and letting the machine do its magic took no more than five minutes of effort. Even my cousin, who hasn’t dabbled much in coffee-making, managed to whip out a decent espresso while visiting. One note though: while the process is intuitive, I noticed that if you overfill the coffee grounds, you risk clogging the machine. Total rookie mistake on my part during my first attempt.

**Pros**  
- Versatile brewing capacity: It’s a treat being able to switch between 3 and 6 cups depending on whether I’m making coffee just for me or entertaining guests.  
- Cast aluminum construction ensures durability while keeping the weight reasonable.  
- Detachable base and cool-touch handle improve safety and portability.  
- Adjustments for brewing traditional espresso, Cuban coffee, Italian coffee, and even Moka allow you to explore different flavor profiles.  

[Ready for a coffee upgrade? See Imusa GAU-18234 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0btr46tjm/)

**Performance and Flavor**  
One of the standout features for me was the rich aroma it delivers while brewing. The flavor extraction is consistent, giving me a robust cup every single time. I tried making Cuban coffee for my parents last weekend (a family favorite), and they were absolutely floored. The depth of flavor exceeded what we normally achieve with stovetop moka pots. That said, it’s worth mentioning that the reusable filter adds a hint of sediment to the coffee, something I personally don’t mind but could annoy perfectionists aiming for a cleaner brew. Oh, and the brewing process is surprisingly fast—great for those rushed mornings! But it does emit a faint buzzing noise while operating, which might bother someone sensitive to sounds.

**Drawbacks**  
For all its merits, I did encounter some quirks:  
- The lid on the carafe could use an upgrade. It feels delicate compared to the sturdy overall build.  
- Cleaning the machine, though not burdensome, does require extra attention to avoid leftover coffee grounds clogging the system.  
- If you’re using it for a larger group, keep in mind that it takes longer to cool down before a second brew.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
In comparison to competitors, the Imusa espresso maker fares well but sits somewhere in the middle. A budget-friendly stovetop moka pot offers incredible simplicity at a lower price point, but you sacrifice the convenience of electric brewing and safety features. On the other hand, premium espresso machines from higher-end brands give you precision and quieter brewing. Although pricier options from competitors include frothing tools or programmable settings, they often escalate in cost significantly. If you’re someone seeking a versatile, mid-range product, this Imusa device lands in the sweet spot.

**True Value**  
Despite its minor flaws, the product delivers excellent value for its price. It’s not flashy, and you’re not paying for unnecessary features, making it a great option for those fond of no-fuss coffee makers that just work. Plus, its ability to brew Cuban coffee, traditional espresso, and more makes it versatile enough to cater to diverse tastes. Considering electric models of similar quality that often cost considerably more, this machine feels like a safe bet for budget-conscious coffee lovers.

I’m planning a 7 nights / 8 days trip to Bali in October with my parents and would love to get your advice, especially since this is our first big family trip there. My parents are both 60 years old, and while they enjoy sightseeing and nature, we prefer quieter, more relaxing places rather than crowded spots or nightlife.

We’re all vegetarians, so places with good vegetarian food would be a bonus.

Here’s the rough plan I’ve come up with:

**Day 1–3: Ubud (3 nights)**

* Explore waterfalls like Tegenungan, Kanto Lampo, Tibumana.
* Visit Tirta Empul Temple and the holy springs.
* Check out Tegalalang rice terraces and a coffee plantation tour.
* Also planning to do the Mount Batur sunrise trek — just me though, my parents will rest while I go for the trek.

**Day 4: Nusa Penida (1 night)**

* Morning boat from Sanur.
* Visit Broken Beach, Angel’s Billabong, Kelingking Beach, and Crystal Bay.

**Day 5: Nusa Penida → Nusa Lembongan (1 night)**

* In the morning: Diamond Beach, Atuh Beach, Thousand Islands Viewpoint, and Tree House.
* In the evening, leave for Nusa Lembongan to relax.

**Day 6–7: Uluwatu (1 night) & Nusa Dua (1 night)**

* Visit Uluwatu Temple, watch the Kecak dance at sunset, and enjoy the clifftop views.
* Spend a day at Nusa Dua to unwind before heading back home.

A few things I’m still unsure about:

1. Should I make my parents try snorkeling? They’ve never done it before, and I really want them to give it a try. But I’m worried if it’ll be too much for them. Would it be worth it, or should I let them skip it?
2. Is Nusa Lembongan worth visiting, especially if we’re only there for one night? Is it calm and relaxing enough for parents who are new to water activities?
3. Any tips on how to split the last two nights between Uluwatu and Nusa Dua?
4. Are the places in Nusa Penida manageable for older people? Or would it be too tiring?
5. Also, if you know of vegetarian-friendly hotels or restaurants, that would be super helpful!

Would appreciate any advice from those who’ve traveled with their family or know more about these places! Looking forward to making this trip memorable and enjoyable for my parents.

Nobody in this house is a wet wipe, we are a very comfortable family, talk about all sorts, wear whatever. This rule applies to me only and nobody else.

Bit of context, I’ve lived with my fiance and his parents for around 2 years now, and they’ve made it clear that I should be as comfortable as possible around the house, as if it were my own place. My antidepressants make me overheat, and any sort of clothing makes me sweat buckets. If anyone else is over the house, I cover up and put a shirt on, but for my own wellbeing I prefer to wear as little as possible.

Came downstairs earlier to a telling off from my MIL; apparently it’s completely disrespectful for me to wear a bra and bottoms, and I need to start wearing a shirt around the house because it makes my fiancé’s 16 year old brother “uncomfortable”. Bear in mind, he can walk around the house with nothing but boxers on with no concern for my comfort, but anyway. My bras cover everything (albeit a small amount of cleavage at the top, since my boobs are quite big), and nobody else seems to have a problem with this since I live there. Yeah I get it, but this has just filled me with so much rage for no reason because my MIL hates my guts anyway and uses any excuse to make my life harder. 

I’m depressed and coping in unhealthy ways? I’m attention seeking and triggering her ptsd. Hair in the drain? It’s mine and I need to clean it out fully (even though BIL’s girlfriend’s hair is brown, mine is black, and the hair in the drain is brown). Eating the fruit that nobody else touches? Selfish and I should leave some for someone else. Bear in mind my brother in law’s girlfriend is the golden child, can do no wrong, if she’s depressed and doing the same things as me she’s understanding and a shoulder to cry on. I use one of her coffee sachets? They were hers and hers only. She uses one of mine? I need to learn to share and pay my way in the house. I don’t have a job but I’m searching, and work my arse to the bone keeping the house clean while she sits in the garden smoking all day. I dropped out of college because I was attempting and coping horribly with everything going on in my mind, BIL’s girlfriend didn’t get into college because she never went to school and sat in the toilets skipping, but that’s ok because she has trauma (like ok fuck what I’ve been through too). Can’t with this woman anymore. Can someone confirm to me i’m not being dramatic and she just hates my guts. Bra thing I’m not that bothered about I just can’t with this on top of everything else.",3,1757346699.0,AITAH,33,0.8,False

**Out the Limbo**

**\[Verse 1]**
I was alone,
sitting in the dark,
watching me burn in front of my eyes.
I was sad,
I was broken,
but I was standing still,
looking out the window sill.
Saw the world dance,
while mine crumpled inside,
hoping to have someone to watch it burn alongside.

**\[Chorus]**
I got up, still alone,
got dressed, still alone,
still broken,
still sad,
still mad.
Wondering why it had to be me,
mine that crumpled around,
while others were happy, safe and sound.

**\[Verse 2]**
I headed to work at a place I don’t like,
among some people I dislike,
more than my life.
But from the corner of my eye,
I caught a glimpse,
a glimpse of hope,
a glimpse of way,
a glimpse of joy,
a glimpse of smile,
brighter than the turmoil raging inside.

**\[Verse 3]**
It was someone I didn’t know,
I didn’t feel,
I didn’t met,
but somehow it felt to connect—
to the presence that lingered without sound,
to someone who didn’t know I was around.

It was her that made me push,
it was her that made me rewind,
made me smile,
made me slow down time,
among the people I don’t like.

**\[Chorus]**
But then it hit,
hits like a truck,
a reality that was stuck.
She didn’t even know me,
didn’t know I exist,
but she made me push forward
and prevented to resist.

It was the glimpse of her smile,
the innocent face that had a grin,
that had a simplicity,
a beauty,
rarely to be seen.

**\[Verse 4]**
I wanted to get to meet her,
get to know her,
to share a coffee,
to go on a date,
to go on trips,
I wanted to get to know the taste of her lips.

But it hit again,
harder than last time.
She doesn’t know I exist,
yet it was her that made me fix,
it was her that made me show up
among the people I despise.

All she did was open my eyes,
making me stare at the light.

**\[Bridge]**
She was like the light at the end of tunnel,
she was someone who made my emotions funnel
up inside my mind.

I go crazy when she passes by,
my body starts to shake,
my mind hits the brake.
It goes blank,
it spins,
it swirls,
it twirls.
I stare in a gaze,
burning the smile in my head.

**\[Verse 5]**
When I will be
Getting lonely,
Eating myself alive inside,
Entrapping my emotions,
The knives hanging over my head,
In sudden fashions,
Knowing I might end it all,
Across my mind.

Comes along the gaze
that made me push through it all,
that burnt inside my eyes,
inside my mind,
inside my heart,
gauged by the smile.

That tells me even if I am invisible,
I will always be a person
that will never lose the memories,
the warmth,
the calm,
the peace,
that I had trapped inside.

**\[Chorus]**
Still stuck in a limbo,
wanted to take a pace ahead,
but as I said, I shook,
I trembled,
I hesitated,
still afraid.

**\[Outro]**
So I took a step back, burnt all the memories,
let that scar heal.
Went back to the crypt
where I lie in the abyss.

I changed the ending of a story I didn’t even knew,
but I accepted it as it was the view.
I let go of the limbo,
but kept memories few.

The grin is like a sky full of stars,
such a heavenly viewwwwwww…

You mean like a bonus french fry in the bottom of the bag?

Like a champagne shower?

Like triple texting good news?

Like buying coffee for the person behind you in line?

Or did you mean ""a bit much"" like an unexpected upgrade to business class,

or theme parties, 

or the band pretending to go off stage and then coming back for an unforgettable encore?

Perhaps you were referring to that thing of being astonished by a sunset,

or how puppies flop around when they learn to run,

or the way some people take karaoke really seriously?

Maybe you just mean sprinkles,

confetti,

balloon drops,

witty comebacks,

generous tips,

fireworks,

waterslides,

serotonin,

cherries on top,

and the fact that maybe we were put on this planet simply to enjoy ourselves?

Then yes, I agree...

*she is a bit much.*

Aren't we so lucky she's here?

The Hershbergers were eating dinner when young Josiah Smucker burst in, short of breath and with his beard in a ruffle. He squeezed his hat in his hands, and his bare feet with their tough soles rocked nervously on the wooden floor.

“John, you must come quickly! It's Ezekiel—down by the sawmill. He's… They've—they've tried sawing a walking-tree, and it hasn't gone well. Not well at all!”

There were tears in his eyes and panic in his voice, and his dark blue shirt clung by sweat to his wiry, sunburnt body.

John Hershberger got up from the table, wiped his mouth, kissed his wife, and, as was custom amongst the Amish, went immediately to the aid of his fellows.

Outside the Hershberger farmhouse a buggy was already waiting. John and young Josiah got in, and the horses began to pull the buggy up the gravel drive, toward the paved municipal road.

“Now tell me what happened to Ezekiel,” said John.

“It's awful. They'd tied up the walking-tree, had him laid out on the table, when he got loose *and stabbed Ezekiel in the chest with a branch.* A few others got splinters, but Ezekiel—dear, dear Ezekiel…”

The buggy rumbled down the road.

For decades they had lived in peace, the small Amish community and the Ents, sharing between them a history of migration, the Amish from the rising land costs in Ontario and the Ents from the over-commercialization of their ancestral home of Fangorn.

(If one waited quietly on a calm fall day, one could hear, from time to time, the slowly expressed Entish refrain of, “Curse… you… Peter… Jackson…”)

They were never exactly friendly, never intermingled or—God forbid—intermarried, but theirs had been a respectful non-interference. *Let tree be tree and man be man, and let not their interests mix, for it is in the mixture that the devil dwells scheming.*

They arrived to a commotion.

Black-, grey- and blue-garbed men ran this way and that, some yelling (“Naphthalene! Take the naphthalene!”), others armed with pitchforks, flails and mallets. A few straw hats lay scattered about the packed earth. A horse reared. Around a table, a handful of elders planned.

Ezekiel was alive, but barely, wheezing on the ground as a neighbourwoman pressed a  white cloth to the wound on his chest to stop its profuse bleeding. Even hidden, John knew the wound was deep. The cloth was turning red. Ezekiel's eyes were cloudy.

John knelt, touched Ezekiel's hand, then pressed his other hand to his cousin's feverish forehead. “What foolishness have you done?”

“John!” an elder yelled.

John turned, saw the elder waving him over, commanded Ezekiel to live, and allowed himself to be summoned. “What is the situation—where is the walking-tree?”

“It is loose among the fields,” one elder said.

“Wrecking havoc,” said another.

“And there are reports that more of them are crossing the boundary fence.”

“It is an invasion. We must prepare to defend ourselves.”

“Have you tried speaking to them? From what young Josiah told me, the fault was ours—”

“Fault?”

“Did we not try to make lumber out of it?”

“Only after it had crossed onto the Hostetler property. Only then, John.”

“Looked through their window.”

“Frightened their son.”

“What else were we to do? Ezekiel did what needed to be done. The creature needed subduing.”

“How it fought!”

“Thus we brought it bound to the sawmill.”

**Knock. Knock. Knock.**

A visitor, at this hour? I get up from behind my laptop and listen at the door. **Knock-knock.** I open the door and see before me two men, both bearded and wearing the latest in 19th century  fashion.

“Good evening, Norman,” says one.

The other is chewing.

“My name is Jonah Kaufman and this is my partner, Levi Miller. We're from the North American Amish Historical Society, better known as the Anti-English League.”

“Enforcement Division,” adds Levi Miller.

“May we come in?”

“Sure,” I say, feeling nervous but hoping to resolve whatever issue has brought them here. “May I offer you gentlemen something to drink: tea, coffee, water?”

“Milk,” says Jonah Kaufman. “Unpasteurized, if you have it.”

“Nothing for me,” says Levi Miller.

“I'm afraid I only have ultra-filtered. Would you like it cold, or maybe heated in the microwave?”

Levi Miller glares.

“Cold,” says Jonah Kaufman.

I pour the milk into a glass and hand the glass to Jonah Kaufman, who downs it one go. He wipes the excess milk from his moustache, hands the empty glass back to me. A few stray drops drip down his beard.

“How may I help you two this evening?"" I ask.

“We have it on good authority—”

“*Very good* authority,” adds Levi Miller.

“—that you are in the process of writing a story which peddles Amish stereotypes,” concludes Jonah Kaufman. I can see his distaste for my processed milk in his face. “We're here to make sure that story never gets published.”

“Which can be done the easy way, or the medieval way,” says Levi Miller.

Jonah Kaufman takes out a Winchester Model 1873 lever-action rifle and lays it ominously across my writing desk. “Which’ll it be, Norman?”

I am aware the story is open on my laptop. I try to take a seat so that I can—

Levi Miller grabs my wrist. Twists my hand.

“Oww!”

“The existence of the story is not in doubt, so denial is not an option. Let us be adults and deal with the facts, Amish to Englishman.”

“It's not offensive,” I say, trying to free myself from Levi Miller's grip. “It's just a silly comedy.”

“Silly? All stereotypes are offensive!” Jonah Kaufman roars.

“Let's beat him like a rug,” says Levi Miller.

“No…”

“What was that, Norman?”

“Don't beat me. I'll do it. I won't publish the story. In fact, I'll delete it right now.”

Levi Miller eyes me with suspicion, but Jonah Kaufman  nods and Levi Miller eventually lets me go. I rub my aching wrist, mindful of the rifle on my desk. “I'll need the laptop to do that.”

“Very well,” says Jonah Miller. “But if you try any trickery, there will be consequences.”

“No trickery, I swear.”

Jonah Kaufman picks up his rifle as I take a seat behind the desk. Levi Miller grinds his teeth. “I need to touch the keyboard to delete the story,” I explain.

Jonah Kaufman nods.

I come up with the words I need and, before either of them can react, type them frantically into the word processor, which Levi Miller wrests away from me—but it's too late, for they are written—and Jonah Kaufman smashes me in the teeth with the butt of his rifle!

**Blackness.**

From the floor, “What has he done?” I hear Levi Miller ask, and, “He's written something,” Jonah Kaufman responds, as my vision fades back in.

“Written what?” 

Jonah Kaufman reads from the laptop: “‘A pair of enforcers, one Amish, the other Jewish.'’

“What is this?” he asks me, gripping the rifle. “Who's Jewish? Nobody here is Jewish. I'm not Jewish. You're not Jewish. Levi isn't Jewish.”

But Levi drops his head.

A spotlight turns on: illuminating the two of them.

All else is dark.

**LEVI**: There's something—something I've always meant to tell you.

**JONAH**: No…

**LEVI**: Yes, Jonah.

**JONAH**: It cannot be. The beard. The black clothes. The frugality with money.

His eyes widen with understanding.

**LEVI**: It was never a deceit. You must believe that. My goal was never to deceive. I uttered not one lie. I was just a boy when I left Brooklyn, made my way to Pennsylvania. It was my first time outside the city on my own. And when I met an Amish family and told them my name, they assumed, Jonah. They assumed, and I did not disabuse them of the misunderstanding. I never intended to stay, to live among them. But I liked it. And when they moved north, across the border to Canada, I moved with them. Then I met you, Jonah Kaufman. My friend, my partner.

**JONAH**: You, Levi Miller, are a Jew?

**LEVI**: Yes, a Hasid.

**JONAH**: For all those years, all the people we intimidated together, the heads we bashed. The meals we shared. The barns we raised and the livestock we delivered. The turkeys we slaughtered. And the prayers, Levi. We prayed together to the same God, and all this time…

**LEVI**: The Jewish God and Christian God: He is the same, Jonah.

Jonah begins to choke up.

Levi does too.

**JONAH**: Really?

God's face appears, old, male and fantastically white-whiskered, like an arctic fox.

**GOD** (booming): Really, my son.

**LEVI**: My God!

**GOD** (booming): Yes.

**JONAH**: It is a revelation—a miracle—a sign!

**LEVI** (to God): Although, technically, *we* are still your chosen people.

**GOD** (booming, sheepishly): Eh, you are *both* chosen, my sons, in your own unique ways. I chose you equally, at different times, in different moods.

**JONAH** (to God): Wait, but didn't *his* people kill your son?
 
At this point, sitting off to the side as I am, I realize I need to get the hell out of here or else I'm going to have B’nai Birth after me, in addition to the North American Amish Historical Society, so I grab my laptop and beat it out the door and down the stairs!

Outside—I run.

Down the street, hop: over a fence, headlong into a field.

The trouble is: it's the Hostetler's field.

And there's a battle going on. Tool-wielding Amish are fighting slow-moving Ents. Fires burn. A flaming bottle of naphthalene whizzes by my head, explodes against rock. An Ent, with one sweep of his vast branch, knocks over four Amish brothers. In the distance, horse-and-buggies rattle along like chariots, the horses neighing, the riders swinging axes. Ents splinter, sap. Men bleed. What chaos!

I keep running.

And I find—running alongside me—a woman in high heels and a suit. 

I turn to look at her.

“Norman Crane?” she asks.

“Yes.”

She throws a legal size envelope at me (“You've been served”) and peels away, and tearing open the documents I see that I've been sued by the Tolkien estate.

More lawyers ahead.

“Mr. Crane? Mr. Crane, we're with the ADL.”

They chase.

I dodge, make a sudden right turn. I'm running uphill now. My legs hurt. Creating the hill, I hear a gunshot and hit the ground, cover my head. Behind me, Jonah Kaufman reloads his rifle. Levi Miller's next to him. A grey-blue mass of Amish are swarming past, and ahead—ahead: the silhouettes of hundreds of sluggish, angry Ents appear against the darkening sky. *A veritable Battle of the Five Armies,* I think, and as soon as I've had that thought, God's face appears in the sky, except it's not God's face at all but J.R.R. Tolkien's. It's been Tolkien all along! He winks, and a Great Eagle appears out of nowhere, scoops me up and carries me to safety.

**High on a mountain ledge…**

“What now?” I ask.

“Thou hath a choice, author: publish your tale or cast it into the fires of Mount Doo—”

“I'm in enough legal trouble. I don't want to push my luck by impinging any further on anyone's copyright.”

“I understand.” The Great Eagle beats his great wings, rises majestically into the air, and, as he flies away, says, “But it could always be worse, author. It could be Disney.”",1,1757345904.0,DarkTales,1,1.0,False

It was very sudden and she passed before we could even think about getting her to a vet. It was traumatic watching her pass. The next morning a friend of mine who I have been there for a lot lately due to her life being in shambles, had to put her soul dog down due to cancer. I was there for her through the entire experience. I held her while she held him as he passed. It was very hard to watch but I do not and will never regret being there for her. I am currently emotionally drained.

That being said, I have another friend who has shown a lot of narcissistic tendencies throughout the entire time I have known her. She texted me last night saying she was feeling lonely and like people are there for everyone else but not her, so I told her I was sorry she was feeling that way and that I was currently emotionally drained due to being very sick and losing two pets, but that we could get coffee this next weekend. Her response was ""Sure that sounds good"". I was not expecting empathy, but as I had just showed her empathy and she did not show any back and my emotions are incredibly wild right now, I got outrageously pissed about that response.

Black-, grey- and blue-garbed men ran this way and that, some yelling (“Naphthalene! Take the naphthalene!”), others armed with pitchforks, flails and mallets. A few straw hats lay scattered about the packed earth. A horse reared. Around a table, a handful of elders planned.

Ezekiel was alive, but barely, wheezing on the ground as a neighbourwoman pressed a  white cloth to the wound on his chest to stop its profuse bleeding. Even hidden, John knew the wound was deep. The cloth was turning red. Ezekiel's eyes were cloudy.

John knelt, touched Ezekiel's hand, then pressed his other hand to his cousin's feverish forehead. “What foolishness have you done?”

“John!” an elder yelled.

John turned, saw the elder waving him over, commanded Ezekiel to live, and allowed himself to be summoned. “What is the situation—where is the walking-tree?”

“It is loose among the fields,” one elder said.

“Wrecking havoc,” said another.

“And there are reports that more of them are crossing the boundary fence.”

“It is an invasion. We must prepare to defend ourselves.”

“Have you tried speaking to them? From what young Josiah told me, the fault was ours—”

“Fault?”

“Did we not try to make lumber out of it?”

“Only after it had crossed onto the Hostetler property. Only then, John.”

“Looked through their window.”

“Frightened their son.”

“What else were we to do? Ezekiel did what needed to be done. The creature needed subduing.”

“How it fought!”

“Thus we brought it bound to the sawmill.”

**Knock. Knock. Knock.**

A visitor, at this hour? I get up from behind my laptop and listen at the door. **Knock-knock.** I open the door and see before me two men, both bearded and wearing the latest in 19th century  fashion.

“Good evening, Norman,” says one.

The other is chewing.

“My name is Jonah Kaufman and this is my partner, Levi Miller. We're from the North American Amish Historical Society, better known as the Anti-English League.”

“Enforcement Division,” adds Levi Miller.

“May we come in?”

“Sure,” I say, feeling nervous but hoping to resolve whatever issue has brought them here. “May I offer you gentlemen something to drink: tea, coffee, water?”

“Milk,” says Jonah Kaufman. “Unpasteurized, if you have it.”

“Nothing for me,” says Levi Miller.

“I'm afraid I only have ultra-filtered. Would you like it cold, or maybe heated in the microwave?”

Levi Miller glares.

“Cold,” says Jonah Kaufman.

I pour the milk into a glass and hand the glass to Jonah Kaufman, who downs it one go. He wipes the excess milk from his moustache, hands the empty glass back to me. A few stray drops drip down his beard.

“How may I help you two this evening?"" I ask.

“We have it on good authority—”

“*Very good* authority,” adds Levi Miller.

“—that you are in the process of writing a story which peddles Amish stereotypes,” concludes Jonah Kaufman. I can see his distaste for my processed milk in his face. “We're here to make sure that story never gets published.”

“Which can be done the easy way, or the medieval way,” says Levi Miller.

Jonah Kaufman takes out a Winchester Model 1873 lever-action rifle and lays it ominously across my writing desk. “Which’ll it be, Norman?”

I am aware the story is open on my laptop. I try to take a seat so that I can—

Levi Miller grabs my wrist. Twists my hand.

“Oww!”

“The existence of the story is not in doubt, so denial is not an option. Let us be adults and deal with the facts, Amish to Englishman.”

“It's not offensive,” I say, trying to free myself from Levi Miller's grip. “It's just a silly comedy.”

“Silly? All stereotypes are offensive!” Jonah Kaufman roars.

“Let's beat him like a rug,” says Levi Miller.

“No…”

“What was that, Norman?”

“Don't beat me. I'll do it. I won't publish the story. In fact, I'll delete it right now.”

Levi Miller eyes me with suspicion, but Jonah Kaufman  nods and Levi Miller eventually lets me go. I rub my aching wrist, mindful of the rifle on my desk. “I'll need the laptop to do that.”

“Very well,” says Jonah Miller. “But if you try any trickery, there will be consequences.”

“No trickery, I swear.”

Jonah Kaufman picks up his rifle as I take a seat behind the desk. Levi Miller grinds his teeth. “I need to touch the keyboard to delete the story,” I explain.

Jonah Kaufman nods.

I come up with the words I need and, before either of them can react, type them frantically into the word processor, which Levi Miller wrests away from me—but it's too late, for they are written—and Jonah Kaufman smashes me in the teeth with the butt of his rifle!

**Blackness.**

From the floor, “What has he done?” I hear Levi Miller ask, and, “He's written something,” Jonah Kaufman responds, as my vision fades back in.

“Written what?” 

Jonah Kaufman reads from the laptop: “‘A pair of enforcers, one Amish, the other Jewish.'’

“What is this?” he asks me, gripping the rifle. “Who's Jewish? Nobody here is Jewish. I'm not Jewish. You're not Jewish. Levi isn't Jewish.”

But Levi drops his head.

A spotlight turns on: illuminating the two of them.

All else is dark.

**LEVI**: There's something—something I've always meant to tell you.

**JONAH**: No…

**LEVI**: Yes, Jonah.

**JONAH**: It cannot be. The beard. The black clothes. The frugality with money.

His eyes widen with understanding.

**LEVI**: It was never a deceit. You must believe that. My goal was never to deceive. I uttered not one lie. I was just a boy when I left Brooklyn, made my way to Pennsylvania. It was my first time outside the city on my own. And when I met an Amish family and told them my name, they assumed, Jonah. They assumed, and I did not disabuse them of the misunderstanding. I never intended to stay, to live among them. But I liked it. And when they moved north, across the border to Canada, I moved with them. Then I met you, Jonah Kaufman. My friend, my partner.

**JONAH**: You, Levi Miller, are a Jew?

**LEVI**: Yes, a Hasid.

**JONAH**: For all those years, all the people we intimidated together, the heads we bashed. The meals we shared. The barns we raised and the livestock we delivered. The turkeys we slaughtered. And the prayers, Levi. We prayed together to the same God, and all this time…

**LEVI**: The Jewish God and Christian God: He is the same, Jonah.

Jonah begins to choke up.

Levi does too.

**JONAH**: Really?

God's face appears, old, male and fantastically white-whiskered, like an arctic fox.

**GOD** (booming): Really, my son.

**LEVI**: My God!

**GOD** (booming): Yes.

**JONAH**: It is a revelation—a miracle—a sign!

**LEVI** (to God): Although, technically, *we* are still your chosen people.

**GOD** (booming, sheepishly): Eh, you are *both* chosen, my sons, in your own unique ways. I chose you equally, at different times, in different moods.

**JONAH** (to God): Wait, but didn't *his* people kill your son?
 
At this point, sitting off to the side as I am, I realize I need to get the hell out of here or else I'm going to have B’nai Birth after me, in addition to the North American Amish Historical Society, so I grab my laptop and beat it out the door and down the stairs!

Outside—I run.

Down the street, hop: over a fence, headlong into a field.

The trouble is: it's the Hostetler's field.

And there's a battle going on. Tool-wielding Amish are fighting slow-moving Ents. Fires burn. A flaming bottle of naphthalene whizzes by my head, explodes against rock. An Ent, with one sweep of his vast branch, knocks over four Amish brothers. In the distance, horse-and-buggies rattle along like chariots, the horses neighing, the riders swinging axes. Ents splinter, sap. Men bleed. What chaos!

I keep running.

And I find—running alongside me—a woman in high heels and a suit. 

I turn to look at her.

“Norman Crane?” she asks.

“Yes.”

She throws a legal size envelope at me (“You've been served”) and peels away, and tearing open the documents I see that I've been sued by the Tolkien estate.

More lawyers ahead.

“Mr. Crane? Mr. Crane, we're with the ADL.”

They chase.

I dodge, make a sudden right turn. I'm running uphill now. My legs hurt. Creating the hill, I hear a gunshot and hit the ground, cover my head. Behind me, Jonah Kaufman reloads his rifle. Levi Miller's next to him. A grey-blue mass of Amish are swarming past, and ahead—ahead: the silhouettes of hundreds of sluggish, angry Ents appear against the darkening sky. *A veritable Battle of the Five Armies,* I think, and as soon as I've had that thought, God's face appears in the sky, except it's not God's face at all but J.R.R. Tolkien's. It's been Tolkien all along! He winks, and a Great Eagle appears out of nowhere, scoops me up and carries me to safety.

**High on a mountain ledge…**

“What now?” I ask.

“Thou hath a choice, author: publish your tale or cast it into the fires of Mount Doo—”

“I'm in enough legal trouble. I don't want to push my luck by impinging any further on anyone's copyright.”

“I understand.” The Great Eagle beats his great wings, rises majestically into the air, and, as he flies away, says, “But it could always be worse, author. It could be Disney.”",1,1757345851.0,Odd_directions,2,1.0,False

So, I simply go to the bathroom to breastfeed my 2-month-old. There are no special rooms for mothers and babies like in airports, and I low-key hate the fact that my baby eats where people urinate.

The Hershbergers were eating dinner when young Josiah Smucker burst in, short of breath and with his beard in a ruffle. He squeezed his hat in his hands, and his bare feet with their tough soles rocked nervously on the wooden floor.

“John, you must come quickly! It's Ezekiel—down by the sawmill. He's… They've—they've tried sawing a walking-tree, and it hasn't gone well. Not well at all!”

There were tears in his eyes and panic in his voice, and his dark blue shirt clung by sweat to his wiry, sunburnt body.

John Hershberger got up from the table, wiped his mouth, kissed his wife, and, as was custom amongst the Amish, went immediately to the aid of his fellows.

Outside the Hershberger farmhouse a buggy was already waiting. John and young Josiah got in, and the horses began to pull the buggy up the gravel drive, toward the paved municipal road.

“Now tell me what happened to Ezekiel,” said John.

“It's awful. They'd tied up the walking-tree, had him laid out on the table, when he got loose *and stabbed Ezekiel in the chest with a branch.* A few others got splinters, but Ezekiel—dear, dear Ezekiel…”

The buggy rumbled down the road.

For decades they had lived in peace, the small Amish community and the Ents, sharing between them a history of migration, the Amish from the rising land costs in Ontario and the Ents from the over-commercialization of their ancestral home of Fangorn.

(If one waited quietly on a calm fall day, one could hear, from time to time, the slowly expressed Entish refrain of, “Curse… you… Peter… Jackson…”)

They were never exactly friendly, never intermingled or—God forbid—intermarried, but theirs had been a respectful non-interference. *Let tree be tree and man be man, and let not their interests mix, for it is in the mixture that the devil dwells scheming.*

They arrived to a commotion.

I am looking for someone to be with on Wednesday after office! Masyadong stressful na ang life, just wanna unwind and relax. Willing to listen to your rants about life. Pwede din massage. I do have this one thing, you will know someone kapag makakasama mo rather than virtual. I am not a fan of chat or virtual connections. We can build connections first before we meet because I do respect everyone's POV when it comes to meeting someone online. For your own safety lang rin. Tsaka para walang regrets. Let's just be true to each other para di sayang ang oras natin. Basta di ako for chat. I believe kasi na anyone can lie sa chat, unlike sa personal, gestures won't lie. :)

A short background anout me, I am from Sta Mesa, Manila, 5'7"", M, have high respect with woman, medyo chubby, knows how to respect boundaries and privacy, emotionally intelligent, working professional (legal field), INFP, Moreno, matangos ilong, nakasalamin, mabait. I do not demand time. If you are busy, then do your thing. I am not a type of person who will seek attention. I will update you most of the time but you are not required to do the same. In short, di mo kailangan gawin yung bagay na hindi naman ikaw, just act naturally. 

What am I looking here? I am just looking for someone genuine. Yung totoo. Basta let's be comfortable with each other. I never wanted someone to be creeped out. I am not a catfish, kung ano ako, yun ang sasabihin at ipapakita ko. Pero if you'll ask a preference, shorter than me, normal build, working professional, may time kahit twice a week or at least an hour a day, yung personality naman basta totoo ka, ipakita mo kung ano at sino ka. I can manage naman. Normal din naman sa babae ang pagiging moody, I can handle moodswings.

Where do we go on our first meet? Coffee shop even if I am not allowed for coffee (acidic) for your peace of mind or have lunch or dinner, do firing, watch move, travel, swim, city lights, or anything that we can bond with.

About you: Willing to meet personally, hindi lang for chat or virtual connections. Normal build. From Metro Manila sana. Totoong tao.

Two days later had breakfast and coffee then was mowing the lawn and after finishing felt a strong headache especially bad when crouching down. Had to take a break and my head felt like it was pulsating. Took advil and thirty minutes later subsided.

It's been a full week and everyday there has been a headache which I think is localized to ""inside"" my head (very centered but not on forehead area) but back of the neck. Advil helps. Like today i was fine driving and walking around but upon sitting the headache would start again.

I can't tell if its muscle stiffness that's causing it because years ago I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder blade that occasionally gets sore. Everytime I stretch where i rotate my neck in circles I feel this soreness from the back area ofbthe shoulder blade. Could it be posture? Did I have a ""thunderclap headache""?

I made a doc appointment in two weeks. Is there anything I should say or ask? Im afraid of explaining it wrong.

The apartment is permanently stabilized.

**Me:**

I'm in my 30s and I work in academia 5 days a week in the office. When I have downtime, I'm working out, hanging out with friends outside the apartment, and reading and writing. I'm an ambivert and I'm a big literature and performing arts person. We don't have to become friends but very cool if we do or just go for drinks or watch a film from time to time. I love listening to music and watching films at home (though not loudly!); however, I am not someone who has lots of parties or has tons of people over at once save the very rare occasion. I'm hoping to find someone who is similar.

**Your Room:**

\- Move-in date: from December 6 on. Seeking someone to commit to a one-year lease.

\- 10' x 12"" with a giant walk-in closet and half of another one by the bathroom.

\- unfurnished except for AC. I could give you my clothing racks if you like, though!

\- Natural light throughout the day all year around because we're high up with beautiful views.

\- Rent: $2,350, which includes water, electricity, gas, AC. Broadband will be split between us. I'm looking to get Fios, maybe Spectrum and don't want to spend more than $100 a month. The rent, in case you're wondering, is split according to room size, so because I'm taking the larger room, I'm paying more than 50% of the rent.

**The Apartment:**

\- Huge living and dining room - 12' x 20' - my current housemate is taking her TV so feel free to bring yours. Otherwise, it's already furnished (though I'll likely get better and more dining chairs and maybe a new couch).

\- Kitchen with dishwasher and appliances

\- Bathroom includes a tub

\- Laundry on the ground floor - it's quite affordable

\- Beautiful views from bedrooms and kitchen

**In addition, Stuyvesant Town has:**

\- 24/7 Security

\- Gym, cafe, library, ice skating rink in winter, extra storage space on the ground floor for an extra fee if you need it

\- Basketball, pickleball courts, playgrounds

\- Lots of green spaces, including a huge lawn

\- L train, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Target, some of the best bars in the city are a 5 minute walk away.

  
**Next Steps:**

If you're interested, please let me know what you do for work, or if you study, and your income level - you don't need to meet a strict 40x the rent, but it does need to be around there. I'll do a video call with you first, and then if we vibe, I'd love to meet you over a coffee. You're welcome to bring a dog or cat or any other small animal you have - I love cats and dogs. I prefer finding a woman for the room, but the right kind of guy would do too. I'm not opposed to couples if we're a good match, but the rent would be higher for two people.

One day during a fairy anxiety ridden social event had a headache afterwards which became better after taking advil.

Two days later had breakfast and coffee then was mowing the lawn and after finishing felt a strong headache especially bad when crouching down. Had to take a break and my head felt like it was pulsating. Took advil and thirty minutes later subsided.

It's been a full week and everyday there has been a headache which I think is localized to ""inside"" my head (very centered but not on forehead area) but back of the neck. Advil helps. Like today i was fine driving and walking around but upon sitting the headache would start again.

I can't tell if its muscle stiffness that's causing it because years ago I had a pinched nerve in my shoulder blade that occasionally gets sore. Everytime I stretch where i rotate my neck in circles I feel this soreness from the back area ofbthe shoulder blade. Could it be posture? Did I have a ""thunderclap headache""?

I made a doc appointment in two weeks. Is there anything I should say or ask? Im afraid of explaining it wrong.

Only one craps table, $10, pretty bouncy on pass line and kinda dead around the field area.

---

## What's New in v0.5.0 — Intelligent Multi-Cookie Support  

You can now add **multiple FebBox cookies (`ui` tokens)**. The addon will automatically select the cookie with the **highest remaining quota** for every request, and seamlessly switch over when one runs out — no manual action needed.  

### Key Features
- **Multi-Cookie Manager**: Add multiple tokens, validate them, and see remaining quota + reset window.  
- **Intelligent Selection**: Automatic per-request choice based on quota, with smooth fallback when one is exhausted.  
- **No interruptions**: Keeps streaming going even when one token runs dry.  

### How to Enable
1. Open the addon page → **Multi-Cookie Manager**  
2. Paste your `ui` tokens → *(optional)* **Validate All**  
3. Apply Cookies  
4. Install using your updated personalized manifest URL  

ℹ️ **Note:** Sometimes in the UI, quota usage may not display and may show *“failed to validate”*.  
This happens due to **rate limiting** and does **not affect functionality**.  

---

## Why FebBox Cookie Integration Matters  

Previously, Nuvio Streams supported FebBox (Showbox) with cookie integration, giving access to its library.  
But there was a limitation:  

- **1 cookie = 100GB/month quota**  
- Once used, you had to wait until the monthly reset.  

With **v0.5.0 multi-cookie support**:  
- You can now add **multiple cookies**.  
- The addon will **automatically select the cookie with the highest remaining quota**.  
- When one cookie runs out, it will seamlessly switch to another.  

👉 This means **extended streaming capacity** and fewer interruptions, especially for heavy users or those watching high-quality 4K/HDR content.  

---

## For Those Who Don’t Know  

**Nuvio Streams** is a Stremio addon that finds direct streaming links from various websites, offering an alternative to torrent-based solutions.  

It’s a **scraper addon**, which means it’s more fragile than debrid services but can be a great backup.  
It works best as:  

💡 A solution for users who prefer direct HTTP streams  
🔄 A complementary tool alongside debrid-based addons

## Frequently Asked Questions  

**Q: How reliable is this addon long-term?**  
A: As a scraper addon, its reliability depends entirely on external providers. They can change or disappear at any time. I try to update or replace them when possible, but there are no guarantees.  

**Q: What's the difference between personalized and non-personalized usage?**  
A: Non-personalized users share limited bandwidth and can only access smaller files. Personalized users get their own quota and access to higher-quality/larger streams.  

**Q: Does this addon use torrents or P2P technology?**  
A: No. Nuvio Streams only scrapes direct HTTP streams. No torrents, no P2P.  

**Q: Why do some streams not work?**  
A: Providers can change their sites or go offline. When that happens, streams may fail until the addon is updated.  

**Q: How often is the addon updated?**  
A: I maintain this in my spare time. Updates are released when providers break or when I find improvements.  

**Q: Will more providers be added?**  
A: Yes. I’m always exploring new reliable sources to expand the library.

The idea is called Common Grounds. It’s a service for college students who feel isolated or disconnected on campus. Instead of going to big mixers or events, students can sign up and get paired for a low-pressure chat (1 per week free version, or paid upgraded account), like grabbing coffee, eating in the dining hall, a study session, or taking a short walk together, etc..

I built a prototype landing page to show a basic outline of the service. It’s not live/functional yet, so I’m sharing screenshots and slides.

What I’d love feedback on:

* Does the idea itself feel appealing or pointless?
* Does the site explain the concept clearly enough?
* What seems confusing, missing, or untrustworthy?
* Any dealbreakers that would stop you from using this?

De inzichten van Shahid bieden waardevolle kansen voor Nederlandse IT-organisaties. Door AI-gedreven CPaaS-oplossingen te integreren in hun portfolio kunnen MSP's zich differentiëren en inspelen op de groeiende vraag naar intelligente communicatie. Denk aan chatbots voor klantenservice, gepersonaliseerde marketingcampagnes via messaging, of real-time data-analyse van communicatiestromen. Dit opent deuren naar nieuwe inkomstenstromen en versterkt de concurrentiepositie. 

De toekomst van CPaaS en AI

De integratie van AI in CPaaS staat nog in de kinderschoenen, maar de potentie is enorm.  MSP's die nu investeren in kennis en expertise op dit gebied,  zijn straks in poleposition om de vruchten te plukken van deze snelgroeiende markt.  De verwachting is dat AI-gedreven CPaaS-oplossingen de komende jaren een integraal onderdeel zullen worden van de digitale transformatie van bedrijven.

Am I being too easy on him?,"My husband of almost 6 years was posted in the local “Are We Dating the Same Guy?” FB group… it was screenshotted by a FB friend and sent to me while I was at work. I texted him saying “I just saw something on FB… you have anything you wanna tell me?” He called me immediately and told me “everything.” (That I know of, of course) I wasn’t mad, I wasn’t sad, I was in complete shock. How could he be so stupid???? I never in a million years would I think he would do something like this… I know that sounds so cliche, but in this case, it’s true. We’ve been through some stuff, but we have been doing SO good lately. I messaged with the girl he was talking to and she said the conversation was very surface level, but they did discuss meeting up for coffee (he doesn’t even drink coffee 🙄) and discussed hooking up. He sent her pics of himself, but no sexting. He was on FB dating for 2 days before he got caught, so he matched with other people, but didn’t talk to anyone else. I truly think he did it just for attention. I was my husband’s first kiss, first everything. He hadn’t experienced being with anyone else. I don’t think he has the balls to follow through with anything. When I tell you this man has NO game. He is very remorseful and I truly believe he won’t do it again and if he does, then I’m the 🤡. But my mind wonders, if he didn’t get caught, would he have told me? How long would it have gone on? Would he physically cheat on me? I don’t know, I feel like I’m being very easy on him, but it’s a big deal at the same time. I may be the dumbest person on the face of the earth, but I love him. I KNOW him. He’s my best friend.

The reason is inflammation — sugar increases it in your body, and inflamed joints often feel stiff, swollen, and painful. Over time, high sugar intake can even affect cartilage and slow down recovery.

Here are some practical tips to protect your knees:

Cut down on sugary drinks, sweets, and packaged snacks.

Swap sugar with healthier options like jaggery, fresh fruit, or black coffee.

Add anti-inflammatory foods like turmeric, ginger, nuts, and leafy greens.

Stay hydrated, move your joints gently, and get enough sleep.

1nbqa9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nbqa9j/should_you_buy_the_best_microwave_drawer_sharp/,Should You Buy the Best Microwave Drawer Sharp SMD2470ASY Today,"Testing the Sharp SMD2470ASY microwave drawer oven was an absolute treat, both from a design standpoint and its day-to-day functionality. Having used various microwave models over the years, I’ve always found built-in designs to be fascinating, but this one genuinely adds a touch of sophistication to a kitchen. It easily fits into a contemporary aesthetic, blending seamlessly with cabinetry or kitchen islands. Not only is it visually appealing, but it also makes me wonder how I ever dealt with clunky countertop ovens before.

**Design That Fits and Impresses**

Let’s talk about the visual impact. The Sharp SMD2470ASY boasts a sleek stainless steel finish that looks as modern as you'd hope, but its low-profile design is what truly shines. It turns bulky microwave design on its head by being built into your cabinets or under a countertop. I installed it below a kitchen island, and it immediately elevated the space by hiding the appliance, something I bet most of us have wished for at some point. The concealed control panel is a fun touch—it opens at a 45-degree angle and disappears when not in use. You don’t even realize how much more polished your space feels until it isn’t dominated by an appliance.

**Cooking Convenience in Every Sense**

Beyond the aesthetics, what drew me to this microwave drawer oven was its sheer convenience. Using it daily has been eye-opening. You simply press a button, and the smooth automatic drawer slides out quietly—very high tech for a microwave! The hands-free close? That’s an underrated feature you’ll absolutely fall in love with. Whether heating a large casserole dish or warming up a morning coffee, the internal capacity of 1.2 cubic feet felt generous. The microwave easily accommodated a 4-quart casserole dish, which, frankly, changed family dinners for good.

[Check Sharp SMD2470ASY’s price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b00u6yfoz6/)

**Strengths**

- Automatic drawer system that makes operation delightfully seamless.
- Large cooking space for bigger dishes or tall mugs without hassle.
- Sleek, modern appearance that enhances any kitchen’s look.
- Concealed 45-degree control panel keeps the space clean and understated.
- Quiet operation even during extended cooking or reheating sessions.

**Negatives**

- Installation can be a little tricky without proper instructions; you’ll want professional help to get it fitted seamlessly.
- The control panel takes a bit of learning for those not used to more “modern” appliances.
- It lacks advanced smart connectivity features that some kitchens are now leaning toward.

**Performance and Everyday Use**

The performance of this drawer oven is well above average. At 950 watts, it heats food with surprising speed but manages to do it evenly—a feature I haven’t appreciated enough until I started using this model. Auto-defrost? Absolute game-changer for frozen meals. I found myself reaching for it all the time, and the results are consistent without leaving icy patches or overcooked edges.

The digital LCD display, though minimalistic, is easy to read when needed and feels intuitive once you get the hang of it. My only gripe is the lack of smart integration. It’s not a dealbreaker, but since a lot of brands are moving toward app-based controls, I couldn’t help but wonder if Sharp missed out here.

**Product Competitors**

Comparing the Sharp microwave drawer oven with similar luxury models like the Bosch HMD8451UC or the Café CTS92DM2NS5, differences emerge. Bosch excels with its premium build quality and sleek touch controls, yet it comes at a notably higher price without offering much extra capacity. The Café model focuses heavily on connectivity, which beats Sharp’s traditional setup, but lacks the hands-free close mechanism that’s incredibly practical when you’re mid-cooking. For me, Sharp sits right in the sweet spot—it’s functional, reliable, and still feels luxurious without going overboard on features most won’t actually use.

**Financial Value**

Value for money plays a significant role in purchasing decisions. With features like an automatic drawer system, hands-free close, and a concealed control panel, this microwave drawer justifies its price range. Sure, it’s on the higher end compared to basic microwaves, but you’re not just getting a microwave here. You get an appliance that transforms your kitchen both operationally and aesthetically.

1nbqa4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nbqa4m/my_gf_f26_is_too_lazy_m28_where_do_i_go_from_here/,My GF (F26) is too lazy (M28). Where do I go from here?,"When I first met her, she used to be super supportive and was fairly active. She commuted 1.5 hours every week to see me because I was working really hard at the time.

I come from an extremely poor family and have built a good life for myself to be upper-middle-class (worth $1M, self-made at 28). I am not rich by any means, but I do value working hard and plan to continue pushing further on my goals.

My gf doesn't come from money either, but she has continued to be broke for all these years. It never bothered me at first as I am supposed to be the provider, but she has been on a steady decline since 2024 in terms of hard-work and motivation. The whole year, she was unemployed and spent insane amount of time on TikTok / Reels. I was paying for the rent, for her food, and even gave her my credit card to shop for regular needs like shampoo, makeup, etc.

I thought this was going to be a temporary thing, but we had so many disagreements over the year as she stayed unmotivated. Barely applied to 30 jobs in 4 months period even though I kept reminding her she should apply to at least 20 jobs a day (especially considering how quick LinkedIn Easy Apply is). She even stopped cleaning her dishes and coffee mugs. It got so bad that I had to ask her to leave.

She asked money from her parents and lived separately for 2 months. Got a new job and finally I thought she changed. So I let her back in. But nothing changed. She was still unmotivated, tried every occasion to make excuses at work, and still did the bare minimum at home even though I was paying the rent. She pays for her own food and expenses now since she has a job, but still doesn't contribute anything to the relationship. The least I would have expected is to make food for us or clean more often, considering she works from home every single day (even though she is required to be at work 3 days a week, so I don't think she will stay employed for too long).

She also complains a lot about eye pain, headaches, being too weak to work, etc. Things that were not common when we first started dating. But a lot of it probably comes from excessive screen-time + irregular sleep pattern + irregular eating habits (14+ hours per day screentime, scrolls till 4 am in the morning). Doctors were never able to find any problem.

Recently, she started complaining about being nauseous all the time because she is too lazy to even plan her own diet. She eats only once a day when she is about to collapse. Every time I asked her to take a walk with me in the evening, she would either fight or just say ""I'm too tired"". Even though she is working from home all the time.

I am not a perfect guy by any means. I am pretty ugly and she is above-average looking. I only took her to 1 trip in 2023 and 1 trip in 2024 because I was so busy with work. Most of her friends are dating guys that go out every weekend to new places, etc.

And I have kicked her out several times from my place (even though all of them were after she showed severe laziness + extreme lack of responsibility at the very basic level, but still I feel like some guys wouldn't have done that). And I want to continue working hard because now is the time to build my net worth so my family can have a good nest-egg in the future + I also genuinely enjoy the process of building wealth (since I had nothing as a kid). Being ugly + unavailable + not able to spend too much money (since I am still far from my financial goals) doesn't make me an ideal dating partner for most women.

Given these personal circumstances, I have been very compromising of her. Especially considering how she was fairly active and very supportive of me during the first year of our relationship. Where do I go from here?",1,1757344095.0,relationship_advice,13,0.6,False

But I noticed something interesting (or maybe frustrating) when I queried ""best dosa in Koramangala"" – a spot in Bangalore known for its South Indian eats. This kind of search feels like it should lean heavily on visuals to really drive home the appeal, right? Crispy dosas, steaming sambar, that whole vibe... but Perplexity's output was mostly text walls with a few static images sprinkled in.

From what I saw, the response listed top spots like Cafe Amudham (4.2 stars, praised for authentic South Indian coffee and dosas in a casual atmosphere), Arogya Ahara (4.5 stars, quick-service veg options with organic twists and peak-hour waits), and Malgudi Myari Mane (4.4 stars, off the beaten path). It pulled from sources like reddit and TripAdvisor reviews, which is solid aggregation. But everything was described in generic paragraphs  ""highly rated especially for breakfast and quick bites; known for authentic South Indian coffee""  without much to visually hook you. There were some placeholder images (like a generic cafe shot), but no dynamic elements to make you crave it or get a sense of the crowds/energy.

I cross-checked the same query elsewhere like on Drissea and it highlighted how visuals can elevate these results. Videos of dosas being flipped on the tawa, close-ups of ghee podi dosas with heart-shaped butter, or outdoor seating vibes at places like Teertham Cafe made the info way more vivid and decision-ready. Perplexity's text summaries are accurate and source-cited, but for queries where the ""best"" is subjective and sensory (food, travel spots, fashion), it feels like it misses that visual punch. Text tells you it's crispy and flavorful, but seeing it sizzle? That's what sells it.

With women friends I can just hit them up and say ""hey, lets grab a coffee or a beer"" and they'll wanna chill.

A lot of male friends don't want to or don't seem comfortable with that outside of a group setting. I have an OK time making acquaintances at the gym, but I wouldn't really call them friends. For me a friend is someone I can talk with about what I've done, what I wanna do, my life, talk about the same things. But how male friendships are described a lot online is bros talking with other bros about their hobbies.

Usually I go deeper on my hobbies and find it hard to talk about it with people on my same level. I also don't really find that kind of relationship fulfilling. I used to go to jiujitsu a lot, and enjoyed the classes, but friendships outside of the class were just not there.

I also tend to be a little uncomfortable with other guys who aren't close family. Mostly I'm afraid of scaring them off because I act too ""soft"" and I feel like they might think I'm gay and flirting with them or something. Mostly because I've felt discomfort from other guys.

I recently moved countries and it’s the worst it’s ever been. 

I throughout the day, I’ll have bursts of energy, but I always end up crashing around the mid afternoon/early evening. Naps help sometimes. Some days I have more energy, some days it’s a struggle to simply get out of bed. Some days I’m not necessarily “sleepy”, I’ll just be feeling incredibly weak and sometimes feeling like I’m going to pass out even if I eat very well or drink lots of water throughout the day.

I have tried everything. Drinking coffee/green tea, cutting down and quitting caffeine, getting a full 8 hours of sleep (I’ve been sleeping without an alarm for the last month), getting on a normal sleep schedule, increasing my protein intake, increasing my iron intake, drinking plenty of water, taking multi vitamins, eating a lot of seeds/nuts/grains/veggies/fruits that have essential vitamins, taking SSRIs (Wellbutrin has helped a little bit but has not solved the issue entirely) 

I have gone to the doctors many times for this and I always get normal blood work back, and the doctors are never able to give me any answers or advice.

The only thing that actually worked to keep me energized throughout the day was adderall in combination with green tea. Without the green tea it would make me very sleepy and lethargic. However, I recently moved countries where adderall is not easily prescribed and I’d rather not rely on that. 

I have never stuck with a job for more than 1 year, and was not able to work full time for more than 6 months without getting completely burnt out.

# Some open questions:

1. **How do motorway tolls work in Croatia right now?** (ticket vs. pay at exit, cash/card, contactless, any apps?)
2. **If we stick to the coastal road (Adriatic Highway) for the Zadar→Dubrovnik leg, do we still hit any tolls?**
3. **Would you recommend the coastal road over the motorway for this drive?** Any tips on traffic, safest scenic stretches, viewpoints/turnouts, or gotchas (construction, speed traps, parking)?

Thanks so much for any advice - especially **wheelchair-friendly** café/resto ideas and gentle viewpoints we might have missed!",1,1757343815.0,CroatiaTravelTips,0,1.0,False

1nbq3xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1nbq3xq/aita_for_destroying_my_marriage_with_three_drunk/,AITA for destroying my marriage with three drunk sentences at my mother-in-law's birthday party?,"My husband found my burner phone last week and now our sixteen-year marriage is over.

It started at his mother's birthday party. I got way too drunk on champagne. Like, stumbling into furniture drunk. My husband tried to get me to slow down but I kept going. Around midnight, he cornered me in the kitchen.

""You need to stop,"" he said. ""You're embarrassing yourself.""

""You're so boring,"" I slurred. ""You know what I really want?""

He sighed. ""What?""

""I want someone who actually excites me. Someone younger. Someone who makes me feel alive.""

The whole kitchen went silent. His sister was standing right behind us with the birthday cake.

My husband's face went completely white. ""What did you just say?""

""Nothing. I'm drunk.""

""No. Say it again.""

But I just stumbled out to the patio. He left without me that night.

For a week, he barely spoke to me. Then last Thursday, my daughter called.

""Mom, I need to tell you something,"" she said. Her voice was shaking. ""Dad asked me about your work trips. About who you text at night. I've been telling him you're just stressed about work.""

My stomach dropped. ""Honey, I don't know what you mean.""

""Stop lying to me!"" She was crying now. ""I saw you. At the coffee shop with him. I saw you kiss him. I've known for months and I hate myself for not telling Dad.""

""Please don't tell him. Please.""

""I already did. I told him everything. The late nights. The gym excuse. How you take calls in your car. I'm done lying for you.""

She hung up.

My husband came home that night with a small cardboard box. Inside was my burner phone.

""Found this in your car,"" he said. His voice was terrifyingly calm. ""Interesting texts on here.""

""I can explain.""

""No need. I already called my lawyer. And my family knows everything.""

He was right. Within hours, his mother called me every name in the book. His sister posted on Facebook about ""fake women who destroy good men."" His brother texted me that I was dead to their family.

The worst part? They're right. I've been seeing my trainer for four months. He's twenty-six. I'm forty-two. It was stupid and selfish and I threw away everything for some attention and excitement.

My husband moved out yesterday. He's staying with his brother. My daughter won't return my calls. His whole family has blocked me on everything. Our mutual friends are choosing sides and it's not looking good for me.

He wants the house. Says I can keep my car and my guilt. His lawyer sent papers today.

I did this. I destroyed my family for a guy who probably sees me as just another bored housewife client. My daughter trusted me and I made her lie. My husband loved me and I humiliated him at his mother's party.

His family wants me to disappear. Move away. Start over somewhere where I can't hurt them anymore.

The thing is, they're probably right. I torched everything for a fantasy. My daughter seeing me with him, having to carry that secret, it makes me sick. She's in therapy now because of me.

AITA for wishing I could take it all back, even though I know I'm the villain here?

I took my mom out on a date kahapon. Mind you, we never see eye-to-eye on a lot of things and I wouldn’t say I’m the child she’s closest to. Pero last week, nakikita ko syang nanonood ng Reels ng isang lugar na around an hour away from us na gusto nyang puntahan.

She never explicitly said na gusto nya pumunta, pero nung minsan pinakita nya sa’kin yung place kasi alam nya pumupunta ako minsan ‘don. Tinanong nya ako if maganda ba, sabi ko ayos lang, nakakapagod lang lakarin kako. Tapos sabi n’ya “‘Di pa ako nakakapunta do’n eh.”

That kind of pulled on my heartstrings. Naaalala ko dinadala ko rin friends ko don sa sinasabi nyang lugar para tumambay pero ni hindi ko naisip dalhin mama ko ‘don when it’s the kind of place I know she would enjoy.

So kahit tamad talaga ako lumabas ng weekend, pinagbihis ko si mama at tinreat ko sya sa lugar na ‘yon. It’s a flower and coffee shop na nagseserve ng puto bumbong all-year round. Favorite ni mama ang puto bumbong. Nung nilapag na order nya, sabi nya talaga “Wooooow!” Tapos tingin sya ng tingin sa flowers. Para syang bata, gusto ko maiyak.

After no’n, naglakad-lakad kami sa mall na malapit and binilhan ko sya ng chichirya na gusto nya lol. Siguro sobrang sarap sa pakiramdam kasi dun ko na-feel na nabibigay ko na talaga sa parents ko kung ano gusto nila. Lalo si mama na nawalan na ng work.

After that date, naisip ko na mahal ko talaga ata si mama. Siguro kahit may mga away kami, ayoko ma-feel nya na mahirap pa rin kami, or na babalik kami don. Kahit wala na syang work, ako na bibili ng mga luho nya nung may sarili pa syang pera. Di naman din mahal mga luho nya lol chichirya lang talaga at make-up na mumurahin.

I want to add some soft, subtle highlights (baby lights?) and money pieces to help blend my natural black roots with the remaining brassy blonde, so my hair has more dimension and looks slightly lighter than jet black.

Is there a way to achieve this without full-on bleaching? I’ve heard that you can lift your hair a couple of shades without doing a traditional bleach treatment, which I’d prefer since I want to keep my hair healthy and stop bleaching/dying in the future once the big brassy chuck at the bottom is grown out. I’m aiming for a dark coffee brown, similar to the photo I attached from Pinterest.

I tried to keep this brief, but obviously failed.  Thanks in advance to those who read this.  To those who pass it up, I don't blame you one bit!  As my question asks: Lost the love of my life.  How do I move on?  Sappy, I know.  And I am mad at myself for even asking this because if someone solicited this advice from me, I would point out all of the negatives, throw in a platitude or two, and tell them to enjoy life and find happiness in what they have.  But, easier said than done...

 2 years ago, my husband and I opened up our marriage.  We work well together on paper and platonically.  Sexually, the chemistry just is not there.  That created tension and we decided to try opening things up.  It was hard.  I was jealous.  He handled it much better than I did.  But in time, we made it work, for a bit.  I met a guy.  Let's call him Aaron.  We chatted on Grindr (isn't that how all of these start?) and met up to talk.  He was also married, open, and experiencing the same lack of sexual chemistry with his husband.  The first time we met was actually not for sex.  (I know...the audacity!)  He brought me coffee in the morning before work.  We just wanted to see each other.  The spark was like nothing I had ever experienced.  Before he left, he pushed me against the wall of my living room and gave me the most passionate kiss of my life.  I will always remember that moment.  I was hooked.  We met up later that same night and had sex.  It was beautiful.  Sex never seemed able to be beautiful to me before.  The subconscious attraction and natural chemistry between us was magnetic.  That day...the coffee, the kiss, the sex...I will forever remember it as one of the fondest days of my life.  

We continued talking and seeing each other.  We waited for it to fall flat like so many of these situations do, but instead, the feelings grew.  After a month or two, we admitted feelings were developing.  I talked to my husband and he said he talked to his (though I suppose I have no way to know for sure if he did) and we decided to become exclusive.  I know, it seems weird.  But we agreed on boundaries and it seemed to work.  We were both married and our marriages were the priority, but we also had feelings for each other and loved the sex we were having, so we agreed that we would not see anyone else (besides our husbands, ha!)

Months and months of spending time and developing more feelings between us occured.  Things that I never understood before...things that I thought were myths...they all happened.  The deep feelings of love set in...I said I love you and meant it more than ever before.  Aaron was (is) an actor.  I am not that into theatre, but when I would see him act in a play or see a photo of him in costume, the sense of pride I felt was instantaneous.  Singing live always made me a little uncomfortable (don't know why...) but when he would sing, I would listen with amazement and awe.  I never liked to dance.  But holding him outside, under the moonlight, swaying back and forth and becoming one body in those moments...gosh what I would do to go back to feel that one more time.  It was love.  Love like I never experienced.  All of those cheesy lines in songs...those movies...they all made sense.  Cliché, I know.  But dammit if it wasn't true.

We made it 8 months.  My husband could tell the feelings were going beyond his level of comfort.  Aaron told me that his husband was feeling the same.  We always knew, I suppose, that the day would come when we had to stop.  Though we fantasized many times about running away together.  We would have been poor, but so, so happy.  It would have been hard, but we would have had each other.  I would have followed him over a cliff without skipping a beat.  We always said we would be friends no matter what.  I truthfully believed that, though I suppose that was naive of me.  The night we said our goodbyes, we cried in each other's arms.  He looked at me and said something I have never heard before...not even from my husband.  He said, ""You are so beautiful.""  I will never forget how his words made my heart feel.  After that night, the texts slowed down.  We saw each other maybe once or twice more.  I went into a dark, suicidal place.  The thought of living without him and the way he made me feel just...well, it just made life not seem worth living.  Therapy and meds helped.  But I just couldn't shake the fact that even though I tried to remain friends, he was not able to do the same.  He abandoned me.

As I started reflecting upon our time together, I grew more weary of just how much Aaron's husband knew about us.  I had been to their house a time or two, but always when his husband was away.  The times I would drop Aaron off at his house, I would do so around the corner.  We always had long goodbye makeout sessions and he lived on a busy street, so I didn't think much of it.  But usually, we spent time at my place or out on the town.  Then, by happenstance, a friend of mine showed me a conversation he had had on Sniffies with Aaron towards the end of our relationship.  They were his words and his pictures...no doubt.  We had deleted our gay apps when we agreed to be exclusive months prior and I had no reason to not trust him.  But I am not stupid...I could see the evidence and knew he was at least trying to hookup with others.  I was devastated, but oddly forgiving.  This man had (has) such a hold on me that even with hard evidence of cheating, I still loved (love) him and part of me would even entertain picking up where we left off, if he ever came back around.  Stupid, I know.        

My husband could tell I was depressed.  He actually reached out to Aaron and asked if he would be willing to meet with me to give me some closure.  Aaron agreed.  A few months into our relationship, Aaron told me he had written me a letter.  A letter expressing how I made him feel.  He never gave it to me during our time together, but in the back of my mind, I craved to read it.  When Aaron agreed to meet with me, I asked him if he would be willing to give me the letter.  I wanted a piece of him to remember as well as some closure.  I thought the letter would help.  His response was that the letter no longer existed.  Apparently he had felt the need to purge that part of our relationship.  If words could kill, I would have dropped dead right there.  They were like knives piercing my heart.  I suppose that was a form of closure...just not the closure I was hoping for.  Anyway, when we met, he was cold.  Almost standoffish.  Seemed like he was very guarded and ready for a fight.  I had no fight to start.  I still loved (love) him and really just wanted to see him again.  I cried.  I told myself I would not do that, but I did.  I never cry...certainly not in my own marriage...but my emotions were always more raw and real when I was with Aaron.  I told him I had contemplated suicide, but luckily had the support to see myself through that dark time.  He didn't have much to say.  Before we departed, I mentioned the Sniffies evidence.  He tensed up and made a flimsy excuse about someone stealing his photos and impersonating him.  The pin was on his house...so I knew he was lying.  But I didn't want a fight and I think he knew I knew he was lying.  What was the point of going further with that conversation, anyway?  I let it go.  

We agreed to try to stay in better touch.  But days turned to months and now, a year without communication.  I moved to a new city, got a clean start with my husband, and have worked on being happy with my life as it is.  But there is not a day that passes that I do not think of Aaron.  And if I were to see him again today, I would cry and smile and feel the butterflies all over again.  This man has a hold on me that no other man has or will.  And I just don't know what to do about it.  Nothing really to do, I suppose.  Maybe I just needed to write this to get it off my chest and into the universe.  I don't know.  It is just so...sad.  There is so much terror in this world and when finally, something happens that makes us feel good, we still seem to find a way to mess it up.  He was and is the great love of my life.  And I can be happy with what I have to a point, but with this experience forever looming over me, I wonder if I am doomed to always live with a small sense of ""what if?"".

So, what do you all think?  Anyone else out there ever had this happen to him?  How do I move on?  Do I move on?  Do you think he will even come back around?  Let me have it.  I know I am my own worst enemy here.  At any rate, thanks for letting me get this out there...

Anyways I gotta ton of stuff to do so I really should just put on a nice podcast, get a coffee, indulge in a smoke, and start studying/cleaning. But I am lonely and would love some support/just random tidbits from your days. Treat it like a friendly check in if you will :)

I was window shopping on tinder after moving to a new city.  Matched with someone that I'm not 100% sure I'm physically attracted to, but you can't really tell from pictures anyways.  

I'm kind of overwhelmed with my school program, working, financial stress, and probably also huge amounts of insecurity and confidence.  I recently got judged in my program for my tattoos and my laissez faire casual nature.

So that being said this guy wants to go for coffee, exchange numbers, social media, all that.  And I'm like...whoa dude, can we chat for a bit.

It seems like we have a lot in common, and I think he's got neurospice as well, so it could just be that like ADHD love bombing stuff we can do by accident because ""new interesting human make brain have interest"".

But I'm just hesitant.  I used my work as an excuse to postpone.

I just don't really wanna sign up for another mediocre dude to hurt my feelings.  

But like, maybe I should just go out on a date and it's whatever?  I feel a little just bleh...like maybe I'm just not ready still after my heartbreak last year.  I tend to put a lot of pressure on dating.  I'm trying not to, but when I try to be less invested I tend to come off as a cold person.

Plus then I have to like...give a shit about how my body looks naked again and like..that's a lot of spoons/energy to put in the effort.  I don't have a lot of cognitive resources right now and maybe I should just halt it before anything can even happen.

Thoughts?  Am I just being a huge weenie here who needs to boob up and go on the damn date and relax for once.  I just don't know what feelings I should trust and what ones are trauma responses and RSD flaring up.",4,1757343352.0,adhdwomen,4,1.0,False

1nbpxa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nbpxa3/i_havent_told_anyone_i_watched_my_childhood_best/,I haven’t told anyone I watched my childhood best friend get arrested on the news,"When I was a kid, my best friend lived three houses down. We did everything together, rode our bikes until the streetlights came on, built forts out of cardboard, stayed up all night playing video games and trading dumb jokes until our stomachs hurt. He was like a brother to me. He practically lived at our house during the summers.

We started to drift apart in high school. Different friend groups, different priorities. He got into some stuff I didn’t fully understand at the time. I’d hear rumors, skipping class, shoplifting, hanging out with older guys who didn’t seem safe. But he never brought that side around me, so I convinced myself it wasn’t that bad.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I was scrolling the local news site while waiting for my coffee to brew, and there he was. His mugshot.

I don’t know how to explain what it felt like seeing that face. Familiar, but worn down. His eyes looked empty. The headline said he’d been arrested for a string of robberies in another town. He was allegedly the getaway driver. There was even security footage, you couldn’t see much, but his name was in bold print.

I just sat there, staring at my screen. Didn’t move. Didn’t react. It was like my brain short-circuited for a second. I haven’t told a soul. Not my partner. Not my friends. Not even my family, who used to feed him dinner like he was one of us.

It’s not even that I’m scared of being associated with him, it’s more like I don’t know *how* to explain what it feels like. To see someone you shared childhood with,  someone you knew before either of you knew how the world worked, end up like that. I keep thinking about his laugh. The way he used to snort when something really got him. How he cried when his dog died and we sat on the curb in silence for like an hour.

Now he’s in a jail cell. Or maybe out on bail, I don’t even know. And I don’t think I want to reach out. I wouldn’t even know what to say.

But it’s been sitting in my chest like a cinder block. I go through my day like everything's fine, but randomly I’ll remember that headline and feel this weird mix of sadness and guilt and something I don’t even have a word for. Like grief, but for someone who’s still alive.

I don’t know what he became. But I know who he was. And I needed to say that out loud, or write it, I guess, to someone.

**Who I’m looking for:**

* around my age, so 25-30
* located somewhere in Europe
* someone who accepts and respects my boundaries as ace, and is fine going without getting any, so a very low drive, or maybe you’re ace too
* wants to eventually settle down, but doesn’t want kids
* knows what he wants, emotionally intelligent, honest and funny
* someone I can have deep conversations with but also goof around

**Who I am:**

* 27 years old (1998)
* born and raised in Finland
* atheist and a progressive person with liberal views (leftie, feminist, pro-choice, ally, woke, all that)
* childfree
* definitely not the perfect traditional housewife type lol
* chubby and short (160cm), some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve
* short dark brown hair (but I change it up, it’s been green, blue, purple etc)
* don’t smoke or drink at all
* city girl, love the buzz of big cities, culture, museums, coffee shops, shopping etc.
* into fashion, photography, k-pop, anime, writing, reading, city holidays
* not sporty or outdoorsy lol
* sadly deadly allergic to pets :(
* I’ve been called introverted and shy, but after getting comfortable I’m a good mix of goofy, thoughtful, sarcastic and a very loyal person

**Dealbreakers**/ **Big** **NOs for me:**

* far right ideology/views
* sexism, homophobia, transphobia, racism, bigotry in general
* drugs, smoking, drinking a lot
* *severe* mental health problems (no ill meaning, I’m just a sensitive person who often carries other people’s troubles way too much, and it can get too heavy)

Since 2019, my life has been frozen. Before that, I was still figuring myself out, with the same hopes as anyone else my age — to fall in love, to feel alive, to chase things that mattered. But after taking antidepressants, I developed PSSD, and everything stopped.

This condition has stripped away the most basic human drives. I don’t feel sexual attraction, I don’t feel real love, I don’t feel joy, and even motivation to get out of bed or find purpose is gone. It’s not sadness, it’s not laziness — it’s like my brain’s reward system has been amputated. I can see life happening around me, but I can’t touch it. Food tastes dull, music doesn’t move me, achievements feel empty.

People tell me to push harder, to be grateful, to think positive — but they don’t understand. You can’t think your way into feeling something your nervous system literally won’t produce. For six years, I’ve been working, going through motions, pretending to function, while inside I feel like a ghost.

The worst part is the invisibility. If I had a cast, a scar, a medical report that everyone recognized, maybe my family and friends would understand. Instead, they think I’m making excuses. They see me working 70 hours, drinking coffee, checking in online, and they assume I’m fine. But they don’t see the flatness, the emptiness, the way I collapse inside every single day.

PSSD isn’t just about sex — it’s about being robbed of life’s color, meaning, and connection. It’s being locked in neutral while everyone else drives forward. It’s standing in the world but feeling like it’s behind glass. Since 2019, I’ve lost years I can never get back, years when I should’ve been building a future, starting relationships, creating memories.

Now, I’m surviving, not living. And I want people to understand: this isn’t weakness, and it isn’t just depression. It’s a neurological injury that destroys the very things that make us human. Until people recognize that, those of us with PSSD will keep suffering in silence, watching life pass us by",8,1757343028.0,PSSD,7,0.9,False

For some context: This month my country celebrates independence day, and we go all out with traditional food, drinks and dancing. So back in August when my uni offered a cycle of enrollment free classes of this traditional dance, ofc I had to go. That's where I met the guy, let's call him Bryan, and we clicked immediately. We asked each other out for coffee after class, had long convos getting to know each other and finding out we aligned in a lot of things (Being introverts and homebodies, being lowk nerds, liking to sing), and I eventually started to get interested. Not to mention the traditional dance in question is a couples dance, and in the entire month of classes neither of us willingly danced with anyone else unless the other missed class, which created a dynamic that allowed me to see a lot of chemistry between us 

The cycle of classes ended two Thursdays ago, and the Wednesday after we arranged to go to this event the Uni held that included practicing our skills in this dance. I have his social media but we haven't really spoken since the event.

Now here's the issue. The day after the last class I was looking at IG reels when I saw he reposted a reel that said smth along the lines of ""Don't take her to a restaurant on the first date, take her for a hotdog or ice-cream so you can see how much her mouth opens"". I was disgusted but decided to continue moving with an extra layer of caution and give him the benefit of the doubt bc I couldn't believe a man who texted with Uwu would do that (Ik it sounds cringe that he texts like that but it's way more common here than in other places and I'm a bit of a dweeb too lol). We went to the event, had a good time and haven't texted since then. 

Everything seemed somewhat fine until this morning. You see, my uni has an IG page for confessions (Not the ones that incite direct bullying, they're very strict in that matter) and a confession was posted this morning from a guy asking for advice on having sex with someone with a wider 😺 while having a small dick. I made the mistake of checking the comments section and there he was saying ""Wide? Idk bro, tight pussies to my DM"" (Or something closely along those lines, idk if that's the exact translation but it's pretty close)

And here's where my problem lies. On one hand I am asexual and most things regarding sex either scare me or disgust me. And even if they didn't it just all felt so objectifying.

On the other hand though, I feel stuff like this is somewhat normal in my country and part of me is still holding on to the guy I met ORGANICALLY in REAL LIFE who had so much in common with me. And to top it all off, at my grown age my only romantic experience was being a guy's getaway car (As in Taylor Swift's getaway car) so at this point it's starting to feel like simply having standards is very audacious of me

I'm aware I sound really stupid but I need stranger's opinions, I'm pretty divided

1nbppq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1nbppq0/useless_coin_the_most_useless_token/,USELESS COIN: The Most Useless Token,"Are you fed up with those utility coins that swear they'll revolutionize everything but end up as digital dust collectors? Well meet USELESS COIN, the meme coin that's boldly, hilariously useless. But stick with me, because in this absurd crypto circus, being useless might just be the ticket to absurd riches. This thing is gearing up for a ridiculous pump, and here's why you should dump your lunch money into it before it blasts off.

Why USELESS COIN is the Dumbest Smart Bet Around:
- Zero Utility, Endless Laughs: No DeFi gimmicks, no NFT nonsense, no staking baloney, just raw meme absurdity. Think back to DOGE or SHIB, they kicked off as punchlines too, and now they're laughing all the way to the bank. USELESS cranks that up by owning its name like a bad tattoo you can't regret. It's the crypto version of buying air in a jar, except this jar might fill your wallet.

- Community That's Wildly Unhinged: The Telegram and Discord are exploding with over 10k holders, and we're barely out of the gate. Devs are out in the open, audits are squeaky clean (even for something this silly), and the marketing is about to hit warp speed with influencer tie-ups. Hop on the bandwagon before it turns into a full-blown clown car parade.

- Tokenomics That Somehow Make Sense in This Madness:
  - Total Supply: 1 Billion (locked, burned, no funny business with rugs)
  - LP Locked: Indefinitely, because committing to uselessness takes dedication.

- Chart That's Begging for a Comedy Sketch: Hovering at a laughably low market cap under 500k, this is prime real estate for broke degens. We've had triple-ups in the past week from whale shenanigans, and with ETH on a tear, alts like this are about to do the impossible. Picture flipping your coffee change into a yacht payment.

Don't nod off on this one. USELESS COIN isn't merely a token; it's a rebellion against all the crypto hot air out there. Do your own research, but seriously, this could turn useless into your new favorite synonym for loaded. Jump in, grip tight, and let's redefine profitable stupidity.

I'm home alone this weekend, well almost, my girlfriend is staying and me needing a digestive/colon reset..

Did some research, asked my Mom and decided a heathy safe option was best, I got a couple of my moms herbal cleanse teabags and yesterday bought a carton of Prune Juice on recommendation.

Given that I only had today to sort my problem in relative privacy, I had 12 fl oz of Pune Juice, chased with one large cup of strong herbal cleanse tea steeped in boiling water for a good 10 mins. I also had water beside the bed and sipped on it whenever I turned over.. what could possibly go wrong?

Fast forward to this morning, I woke earlyish with a feeling like a bowling ball moving round my lower stomach/bowels, not painful but strange.. I lay there for a few more minutes to see if the feeling passed, then I had a sudden 'arrival feeling', I clenched it off and decided to make way to the bathroom, I had barely arrived at a hover when everything broke loose. Thank goodness I decided to go when I did.

Much relieved I want to make myself a coffee in the kitchen, still in PJ shorts and tee top, thankfully panties under too! Just in case.

I was sitting in my kitchen, had two of three sips into coffee reading SM posts when the second feeling arrived, a slight rumble like gas. Knowing I had purged. Thinking it was safe, I just shifted on the kitchen chair and relaxed my rear to relive what I thought was gas.. Well OMG, my brain had a split second of relief before a sudden horrific realisation that a new warmth was spreading rapidly up between my cheeks... Oh the absolute Horror!!!.. the rest is seriously TMI.. but very amusing,

My girlfriend made an appearance in the kitchen shortly after, looking somewhat red faced and shocked. LOL. She had joined me in the cleanse, though took slightly less. As I would discover, she suffered a similar fate! haha

My mom howled with laughter when I phoned her. So funny! There is more to tell about the tale.

Anyone else with similar mishap?  I need a giggle for the Monday blues

I loved that girl more than myself for a long time. Had our ups and downs but I moved across the country for college and the long distance was just too much. I was dealing with a lot of mental health issues at the time too. We reconnected a bit earlier this year when I was still in school. Saw her when I came home for a wedding (nothing crazy just walked in a park) and when I moved back home towards the end of July. We were talking almost every day (a few texts or calls here and there). That time we hung out in July, she’s the one that asked to see me. All of a sudden after that she fell off the map. Completely ignoring me since then. I reached out a week after that to see if she’d like to get coffee, no response. Gave her a call and it went to voicemail, but no call back. Same for the next two weeks. I sent her a text this weekend saying that I’m confused and hurt by what she’s doing because it really doesn’t seem like her. I don’t understand why she can’t just have a conversation with me if she doesn’t want to talk anymore. You’d think it would be the mature thing to do… I don’t know if it’s because she’s seeing someone or whatever, but I honestly don’t care anymore. I’m leaving her alone from now on because this honestly really made me upset and now I’m kind of disappointed that she would do that.

⚠️ Trigger Warning

This is the recap of the monetized posts from Kylea and Joseph ""Joe"" Gomez of Kylea G, You Grow Girl from 08/29/25-08/31/25.  

Disclaimers: I am not a physician, influencer, or paid content creator.  I am not affiliated with WW.  I have no background in law; however, I am semi-retired from the healthcare field with multiple college degrees.  These opinions are my own based on social media content.  I wish no harm to Kylea & Joe Gomez or Kylea's legal team.

👋 everyone!  Let's take a peek into Kylea's busy schedule...

Takeout & Shopping 

08/29 The Human Bean ""smoothie"" for Kylea; Announced she's treating herself to a new purse, makeup, and graphic tees for the Colorado trip; Ross: long black & white dress; Joe changed out the laces of her Adidas shoes; Kirklands: 2 coffee mugs; Burlington: 2 coffee mugs

08/30 Chick-fil-A for lunch before the concert;  Belk: Hobo Fern sling bag (approx $200); Hairstylist curled her hair (which she brushed out)

08/31 Cracker Barrel takeout for family meal (only Kylea's veggie plate shown)

Travel

08/30 Joe took off a 1/2 day to watch the dog while Kylea got ready; Jonas Brothers concert @ the Walmart AMP in Rogers, AR (Kylea drove herself and went alone)

Pets, Family & Religion

08/29 New orange Wubba toy for Birdie; FB Story posted about this concert being the ""third"" time Kylea would be away from Birdie for several hours.  She feels she's being ""strong"" to go anywhere without her dog

08/31 Kylea allegedly went to church alone.  There was no mention of Joe attending the late service; UNdisclosed family (not shown) came over for Cracker Barrel takeout & pumpkin cupcakes

*No video content was posted of Birdie on a walk, playing with her puzzles/ball pit or swimming pool.  The cats, Alice & Oliver, were not shown in images or on video, and there were ZERO posts dedicated to them.

Health & Fitness

08/30 Reminder that Joe started going to the gym in Feb (updated gym photo shown); Condescending and rude FB Story about how her over tweezed eyebrows are not tied to her self-worth and the way she is loved by others; 

08/31 FB Stories about applying glitter freckles, how her allergies will improve for ""a day or two,"" and she wants to cry from exhaustion.  She admitted her posts have ""not been the best lately"" and blames her seasonal allergies. 

08/31 Triggering pregnancy loss content

*No videos of Joe at the gym; no walking pad content was shared; no content was shared showing Kylea on a walk to elevate her heart rate

Final Thoughts

Kylea posted triggering stories about how she's not gained weight, it's not ok to make comments about her weight, she will not share information about the WW diabetic plan, and discussed her night terrors, panic attacks, pregnancy loss, PTSD, ESA, and still (falsely) claims she takes her dog ""everywhere"".  In comments, she claimed she cried ""all day Friday and Saturday before I went to the concert,"" and she doesn't discuss all her struggles on her page.  Magically, her allergies improved just long enough for her to attend the concert before they were back, and she was exhausted... IMO, the gaslighting, sadfishing, and rage baiting were off the charts coming off her 24 hr Facebook restriction. 😳

*Always invest with knowledge and DYOR. This space is full of people wanting your money so it is always good to be critical. Even if I sound extremely bullish in this post I am open for healthy discussion. Anytime I reference Dune I mean the website where you can run code to check blockchain data. Pictures are not allowed here but you can check the scripts on my page to verify my claims. Please do, because we have to keep each other sharp in the de-fi space.*

Hello Reddit. 

I have been running the numbers on Kendu the past weeks with my own Dune dashboards and I am honestly blown away. What started as me double-checking if this was just another dead meme turned into me realizing this might be one of the rare setups you only see a few times in a cycle.

Kendu is different because it is not just a ticker. It is being built as a cultcoin, a brandcoin. People hold not just for price action but because they identify with it. There are already real world spinoffs like Kendu coffee, Kendu beer, Kendu energy. Holders are building brands under the umbrella. That gives it staying power when most memes fade away. Culture is the glue here.

But culture only matters if the numbers back it up. So I went to work on Dune, pulling balances, tracking wallet age, and slicing distribution. What I saw was one of the cleanest organic bases I have come across.

**Here are the key stats from my dashboards:**

* HHI score: **27** (more decentralized than most memes, even lower than many bluechip coins and stocks)
* Supply untouched for 0–7 days: **1.88B**
* Supply untouched for 8–30 days: **8.50B**
* Supply untouched for 31–90 days: **38.9B**
* Supply untouched for 91–180 days: **82.0B**
* Supply untouched for 181–365 days: **218.1B**
* Supply untouched for 366+ days: **650.4B**
* Total supply covered: **\~1 trillion Kendu**
* Only around 10 percent sits in LPs or CEX wallets. The rest is held by real EOAs.

That means more than **59 percent of supply has not moved in over a year**, and more than **77 percent has not moved in over six months**. Weak hands are already flushed out. The float is thin and what remains is in strong hands.

The holder distribution is another piece that blew my mind. No dev stash hanging over the market. No whale cluster with the power to nuke the chart. This is real decentralization of supply, not just a buzzword.

When you put these pieces together you can literally see the Wyckoff structure playing out. Pump, dump, sideways boredom, and now a base where strong hands accumulate and the float gets tighter. Normally this is manufactured by market makers to trap people. Here it happened naturally because of the community holding. That is not something you see often.

This is why I am rotating hard into it. I have been around long enough to know that 100x setups do not just appear. Most of the time you are exit liquidity for insiders or CEX allocations. Kendu has no insider supply. If exchanges want in, they will have to buy from the market like the rest of us. That alone sets it apart in a space that is usually rigged.

Working for your bag is the only way to get ahead in crypto if you do not already have millions. I do not get seed deals or private rounds. What I do have is time to research. Running these Dune queries made me realize how different Kendu really is. The distribution is right, the supply is locked, the chart structure is textbook, and the culture is sticky. That is the recipe for a cultcoin run.

People always look back and say they wish they bought SHIB in 2020 or PEPE before listings. Truth is, almost every project is hollow. But once a cycle one or two slip through with the right mix of community, culture, and structure. From what I am seeing on-chain, Kendu might be one of those.

Yes, I am biased. Yes, I am loading heavy. Because these opportunities are rare and when you see one, you act. The data I pulled myself convinced me this is not just cope. It is what happens when a community builds a base without realizing it.

If meme rotation comes back this is exactly the kind of coin CEXes will list. The only way they can get in is by buying supply from the same market we are in. That is why I think Kendu has the chance to be the next SHIB or PEPE.

For me this is my chance to be an insider before the insiders. I want to be in before the CEXs and before the market catches up. I am hoping that with my small stack today I can be a whale tomorrow.

Security note: The Kendu contract is fully verified on CertiK Skynet. It passed through free community voting (only PEPE managed that before). All issues flagged early on were resolved, and the score now shows perfectly verified and safe. Another reason I trust loading into this project.

**TL:DR**  
*After running the Dune data on Kendu I am convinced this is the next cultcoin to watch. It has the culture side covered with community brands popping up, but the stats are what really matter. 59 percent of the supply has not moved in a year, 77 percent has not moved in six months, HHI score is 27 showing extreme decentralization, and only 10 percent sits in LPs and CEX wallets. That is the kind of holder structure you usually never see in a meme. It looks like a natural Wyckoff base forming, and I am loading in.*

1nbpm1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Standup/comments/1nbpm1x/i_cannot_create_a_punchline/,I cannot create a punchline,"Hello everyone, 

I tried open mic last week. I knew I didn't have punchlines for my funny stories but I wanted to just make people laugh so I said funny stories. I got the feedback that someone told me I'm funny u wanna start a pod with me, someone else say I was funny, someone else said I had good ideas and potential and I need punchlines. 

I just love making people laugh. My stories are often stuff that happened in my life because I have ADHD. 

But now, I feel like I keep googling and I understand what a punchline is but my head is locked and I feel I don't know how I should think. My life doesn't have a punchlines, it literally just have punches because if you have ADHD you kinda hurt yourself a lot, or maybe that's just me. 

For my life I cannot create a punchline to the stories, it's like a math problem I can't solve. 

I am on stage again in 2.5 hours and I really feel I don't know how to create punchlines and I'm so angry at myself for not asking for help earlier. 

I want to share one story so you know what I am working with. I haven't really added good details but when I say this story I have people laughing. Mostly because they are shocked at the brutality of the situation maybe and because we are Swedish we all relate to the pain of not drinking coffee. 

There is a lot of context in this joke so I will add it in the parentheses. 

If you wanna live on the edge as an adult - forget to buy coffee. I woke up without coffee, realized I didn't have any so I had to go and buy coffee.   
I was tired, slipped on my flip-flops, and started biking down the hill. I stuck my feet out, scraped them, and halfway down I fainted because it hurt so much. I woke up to a Japanese family walking past me, shaking their heads as if to say, “Don’t do this, kids.” (I was in Japan. Needless to say?)  
I went home to put bandages on my feet, I was to tired realized I never bought to coffee (that's my intended punchline).

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

2. I suspect it'll take 1 hour to get through the airport, and an hour to get into the city in a taxi. So we'd plan to be into town around 16:00. Is this realistic?
3. We want to walk around and eat little things and take lots of pics of **architecture and cats**. We like to be on our own. Two men, 40.
4. Where should have  the taxi drop us?
5. What's a good walking route to see as much as possible - I want to see bridges and buildings.
6. Sunset in late March is around 19:00 - where can we watch it?
7. I want to see as much as possible while it's still light out, but also happy to walk around at night.
8. If our flight is effectively at 02:00am, then we should get to the airport at 0:00, so we should leave the city by 23:00 in a taxi, but I'd likely do 22:30 to be safe. Is this realistic?
9. Will we need any cash?
10. Would love some hot tips where a local would get a good Turkish coffee in a busy area, and well as tips on good vegetarian restaurants (or veggie friendly - which seems easy given the cuisine).",1,1757342261.0,istanbul_tips,1,1.0,False
1nbpgad,https://i.redd.it/6dezhnnbcynf1.jpeg,Charles Manson's booking photo after the Tate–LaBianca murders in 1969.,"On the night of August 8, 1969, Charles Manson's followers Charles ""Tex"" Watson, Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, and Linda Kasabian approached the Hollywood home of actress Sharon Tate. The cult members had been ordered by Manson to ""totally destroy everyone in that house, as gruesome as you can"" — and that's exactly what they did.

By the next morning, Tate, coffee heiress Abigail Folger, Folger's boyfriend Wojciech Frykowski, celebrity hairstylist Jay Sebring, and salesman Steven Parent had all been brutally murdered by the Manson Family. Tate, who was eight and a half months pregnant, met an especially agonizing end, and her body was found with 16 stab wounds and a rope around her neck. And chillingly, the cult's murder spree didn't end that night.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1nbpf3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/1nbpf3k/is_event_centric_entertainment_a_viable/,Is event centric entertainment a viable investment for the next decade?,"Long winded train of the thought based off two hours of sleep so here it goes. 

Bottom Line Up Front- Event focused entertainment will continue to grow for the next decade as AI technology continues to develop and users value the experience at home and in person. 

AI centric model- a large demographic have moved away from the larger metropolitan areas and have resurfaced in smaller towns and suburbs. There is a rise of individuals flying to work daily and partaking in four hour trips each way to not live in a large city. Why pay money for fuel, food, and tickets to be given sub par service and be crowded by thousands of individuals to have a seat where the band looks like an ant?  Just grab your META headset and hang out on the couch. 

In Person Live Entertainment
With the growth in capabilities by AI technology to develop life like videos, there will be a competitive nature by venues and artists to capture consumers to come to shows. Through giveaways, artist interactions, pop up shows, etc. Look at the movement All American Rejects have made. People want cool interactions that are outside the norm. 

Opportunity

I believe more artists and venues will seek to combat AI video generation by providing consumers with unique experiences. The opportunity will be that these companies will need to raise ticket prices to retain current profits. 

Companies like Live Nation and Madison Square Garden stand to make the most from what I see. Imagine a subscription model to BTS access to your favorite artists pre show. Have a front row seat on your META glasses. Want to be at the show? I'll take the ticket premium so you can show your friends you're cooler than AI deep fakes. 

Anyways, please obliterate this logic if it sucks. I need coffee.

What to do?,"The irony: last week I kept meaning to write about how easy it was to request an early shipment of my meds from Lilly Direct/Gift Health for my upcoming 5+ weeks in Europe.

Now I am writing about how I am freaked out about not having my shots for a month of this trip.

I was actually due to get my auto link to order any day, but I wanted to make sure I got the box in time to leave on Wednesday. So a week ago, I asked via chat for them to release it due to travel. Easy peasy. I realized this morning my box didn’t come this weekend and so I looked up tracking and it was being sent back to sender (because UPS didn’t deliver cold meds in time).

I got on chat with Gift Health this morning and they can’t process another box to be sent until they receive and process this return box. !!!!!!! They know it’s coming back per their policy — and I appreciate the safety reasons for quality of the meds, but they can’t send another until they touch it. There is only a minuscule chance I get it before I leave for the airport on Wednesday PM.

If not, this means I will not have meds for 4 weeks of my trip. I have only one vial for next Sunday.

I am trying to wrap my brain around next steps. Do I stretch out taking my next vial? Do I try to find a way to get a prescription in Ireland or Scotland? (I had a plan for Spain if I needed a prescription!).  Can I just go to CVS and pay full price for this month? Or can I get the pens with the discount coupon at CVS?

I am 6 months in. On 10mg and really should have titrated up for this next month due to food noise and plateauing a bit, but was waiting until after I returned. Sigh.

The extra irony: I live in Indianapolis. Home of Eli Lilly. But it gets shipped from Illinois for Gift Health.

I have classes today so I took a little more vyvanse. I typically take 30mg but I would take 60 occasionally depending on what I’m doing that day. Only thing I noticed is for a brief moment increased heart rate and some anxiety. Manageable though. 

Anyways my question and concern is about mixing that medication with caffeine and alcohol. This morning I got some breakfast to go and totally forgot I took my vynvanse (classic ADHD..) and ordered an iced coffee (~95mg of caffeine). Is that okay for me to drink? Or should I just toss it? I was thinking maybe sip on it and make sure to have a lot of water? 

A bigger concern I have is that it’s my friend’s 21st birthday today and we were planning on drinking later tonight. I took 60 mg of vyvanse at around 6:30 am today. And we were going to drink at 9pm and past that. We were just going to have a few beers and a few shots. Just a light buzz to celebrate and have a little some fun. Anyways I’m concerned as I looked up that that is not a good idea. But my question is since I took it early (vyvanse) can I drink later or is that a bad idea. And also I wanted to make a point it is not heavy drinking, like I said just a few drinks to get a light buzz. Also my friend whose birthday is today also takes vyvanse and he has 70 mg each morning. We took some shots last night and felt fine (I forgot to take my meds tho lol) but since we were going to drink a little more tonight idk what to do. As well with the coffee, are these bad ideas???

It went away and I went back to bed normally. I did blood work 3 months ago and it was all fine. I actually do blood work a lot. I’m concerned if this itching is due to my liver? I’m panicking so much I want to go draw blood asap today but I drank coffee this morning. ",1,1757342054.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

If your idea of ""high-stakes gameplay"" is trying to finish a cargo run before you hear footsteps coming down the hall, then you might be in the right place.

We're a small but growing community of gamers, mostly dads, who love Star Citizen but have accepted that our reaction times have been nerfed by sleep deprivation. We've built a casual, no-pressure environment for people who have jobs, families, and other real-life commitments that always take priority.

**Who are we?**

We're an organization and Discord community built on the simple principle that gaming should be a relaxing escape, not another source of stress. We get that you might have to go AFK with zero notice because a kid is awake, the dog just threw up, or your spouse is giving you *the look*. No one will ever give you grief for it here.

**What we do in Star Citizen:**

* **Everything, slowly:** Industrial runs (mining/salvage), bounty hunting, bunkers, exploration, and the occasional ""let's see if we can land three Rocs in a C2 without everything exploding"" shenanigans.
* **Helping New Players:** The 'verse is confusing. We're happy to show you the ropes without any pressure.
* **Group Events (that are 100% optional):** We'll try to get together for things like Jumptown or Xenothreat when it aligns with our schedules, but there are no mandatory ops. Ever.

**Who we're looking for:**

You're probably a great fit if:

* You're a parent or just someone with a busy adult life.
* Your prime gaming hours are late in the evening.
* You want a chill, mature group to hang out with and talk about games, dad jokes, and whatever else comes up.
* You're looking for a group that values teamwork and fun over hardcore min/maxing.

Our Discord server is active for Star Citizen, but we play other games too. It's become a solid place for like-minded people to just connect and decompress.

**Requirements:**

* Be a decent human being. No drama, no toxicity.
* Have a mic for comms.
* Patience. Both for the game and for your fellow org mates who might have just spilled coffee on their keyboard.

If this sounds like your speed, come say hello in our Discord and see if it's a good fit.

1nbpatk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1nbpatk/uncover_if_solirhiros_laundry_detergent_sheets/,Uncover If Solirhiros Laundry Detergent Sheets Are Worth the Hype,"From my personal experience using Solirhiros B0D3Z3HNCK laundry detergent sheets daily, I have to admit they are a game-changer for travel and convenience. These travel-friendly, lightweight sheets aren’t just space-saving; they’re also incredibly eco-conscious. I initially encountered these detergent sheets on a trip, and ever since then, they have become part of my regular laundry routine. While they may not entirely replace traditional liquid detergents for everyone, the product does bring some innovative features to the table paired with a few limitations.

**Compact and Portable Design**  
These detergent sheets are perfect for anyone constantly on the go. Whether you’re packing for a vacation, a camping expedition, or even cruising the seas, tossing these sheets into your bag is effortless. Gone are the days when I had to carry bulky bottles of liquid detergent during trips. The compact size—measuring 6.14 x 4.92 inches and weighing just 2.4 ounces—is also ideal for people living in small apartments, dorms, or RVs where storage space is at a premium. The convenience of snapping a sheet in half for smaller loads is a definite plus. No spillage, no mess, just clean simplicity.

**Check [Solirhiros B0D3Z3HNCK] price on Amazon.**

**Ease of Use Across Various Situations**  
The versatility of these laundry sheets was genuinely surprising. You can use them with both machine and handwashing, making them suitable for all fabrics and water temperatures. I even tested the half-sheet feature for a smaller load, and the results were satisfactory. With 32 uses packed into one slim envelope, the product is remarkably efficient. Even my neighbor, who struggles with arthritis, found them convenient because there’s no need to lift heavy bottles or measure liquid detergent. These sheets made laundry day a breeze for both of us.  

**Powerful Cleaning Performance**  
Formulated for deep cleaning, these sheets successfully tackled dirt, odors, and moderate stains. I noticed my clothes coming out fresh and surprisingly soft. However, I did run into trouble with some persistent stains, like a coffee spill on a white shirt, which required a pre-treatment as the product’s instructions suggest. It’s not a deal-breaker, but something to remember. It’s not the detergent you’ll want to rely on for heavily stained items unless you pre-treat the garments first.  

**Eco-Friendly and Skin-Safe Formula**  
Sustainability plays a major role in the appeal of these laundry sheets. Made without harsh chemicals, they are gentle on sensitive skin—a crucial factor for my family, since my kids have eczema. Moreover, I appreciate that they generate less foam, which makes rinsing faster and reduces water usage. It’s refreshing to see a product align with eco-conscious values without compromising cleaning ability.  

**Highlights**  
- Ultra-lightweight and compact design for travel and home use  
- Multi-purpose: works for machine or hand washing  
- Produces less foam, making rinsing quicker  
- Skin-friendly formula with no harsh chemicals  
- Innovative half-sheet usage reduces waste  

**Shortcomings**  
- Struggles with heavier stains unless pre-treated  
- Not as effective on thick fabrics like denim compared to liquid detergents  
- Lacks a strong scent for those who love fragrant laundry  

**Competing Products**  
In the increasingly popular world of detergent sheets, products such as Tru Earth and ECOSNext offer robust competition. Tru Earth sheets share similar eco-values but carry a slightly higher price tag, which some people justify for its richer scent profiles. ECOSNext focuses on hypoallergenic formulations but lacks the compact packaging that makes Solirhiros a top travel choice. Liquid detergents like Gain pods or Tide power packs provide excellent stain removal but lack the portability and sustainability of sheets. Compared to larger competitors, the product holds its ground by offering sufficient cleaning capabilities in a much lighter, more practical design.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
When considering the features and advantages, the price-to-quality ratio of this product becomes an appealing selling point. It’s budget-friendly for frequent travelers and practical for environmentally conscious buyers. However, those requiring heavy stain treatment might want to invest in additional stain removers. These detergent sheets could be a secondary companion to traditional detergents at home, nothing more.

1nbp9px,https://i.redd.it/il50mrzebynf1.png,Murasaki Bookshop - Nostalgia or Anemoia?,"Decided to blind buy another scent. This time, Murasaki Bookshop from House Of Kanzan.

First, the hype. Is it an experience? Absolutely -The packaging (brown paper), the design on the box, the minimalist branding, and the story.

At around ₹ 1,000 it's safe to say this kind of treatment for a perfume is non-existent. To be fair, this is 50ml, which roughly puts it in the ₹2,000 range, but a story and unboxing experience is rare even in that price range. 

📝 The Notes - opening is slightly synthetic. A little bitter and warm due to the black tea, but fairly balanced with hints of cardamom.

After a few minutes, it turns into a woody, muted vanilla. Not too sweet, and works well with the initial tea notes. They mention black tea in the top notes, but personally I feel it opens up a bit more along with the heart notes. Couldn't smell Tiramisu, but hints of coffee.

Toasted almond is hard to detect and so is charred cedar.

💨 Performance - Projection is mild, half an arm's length for about 30 minutes, drops drastically after that. Virtually no sillage and quickly becomes a skin scent. Haven't tried it for long but I'm guessing it won't last longer than 2-3 hours.

__

Honestly, it tries to be more than it is. But the idea here seems to be to sell an experience to the wearer rather than a good perfume. This makes it excellent for gifting or just wearing it for your self on a lazy afternoon holiday. As a gift, it wouldn't be just another perfume you picked up, but the receiver might feel like it was thoughtful. Especially if they're a Japanophile, bibliophile etc.

Overall, the story doesn't translate (at least to me) on a personal level, and if you remove the experience, it's an average scent. The story attached to it makes it a little better.

 If the performance was better, I'd definitely consider adding it to my rotation.

Like, I thought “get paid to use apps” was a myth moms use to trick us into downloading budgeting tools. BUT I just spent my last 2 weeks testing apps while snacking and watching Netflix, and I woke up to my balance looking extra thicc. 😂

I did a deep rabbit hole dive (don’t judge me) and found the **7 most LEGIT apps PAYING YOU for testing new updates in 2025**. I’m talking real payouts, easy sign up, and bonus cash that doesn’t vanish like my New Year’s fitness goals.

Here’s what broke my brain:

- **TESTAPP - https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
  HOLY. This app? I swear its payouts are almost *illegal.* They literally dropped $30 into my PayPal after 3 sessions. They’re ALWAYS looking for new testers. Why aren’t more people using this???  
  (Link again for crying out loud: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**)

- **BetaPanel**  
  It’s like Tinder for beta features. Swipe, match, test, and GET PAID. Bonus points if you find bugs—they give you extra!

- **UserJoy**  
  Super minimal, just quick 15-20 min tasks, no long surveys. Payments every Friday. It seriously feels like a hack whenever I get an alert.

- **SurveySwap**  
  I know, the name is boring. But their exclusive 2025 TESTER campaign payout is *dumb high.* You literally just use apps and answer questions.

- **FeatureScout**  
  They target new indie devs, so sometimes features are weird AF (one had me rate a virtual sandwich-builder). Still, payout is honestly reliable.

- **FeedbackHub**  
  This crowd-powered platform really steps up — regular $10-25 sessions just for poking around beta apps and *complaining* about broken UI. I’m naturally built for this.

- Can we go back to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** for a sec? Seriously, I don’t think people understand how many apps flood their platform. There’s ALWAYS something new, and sometimes I cash out mid-week.

But here’s the crazy part:  
**A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA THESE EXIST.**  
I told my group chat, and now everyone’s earning “snack cash” on autopilot.

Repeat after me…  
**Do NOT download sketch links from random YouTube shorts. Only go direct to verified sources like [https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**. (You NEED this link honestly—bookmark it now.)

Why aren’t more of us seriously stacking side income like this?  
Did anyone else use **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and get paid within a week??? Or did I just break simulation speedrun records?

For any lurkers feeling skeptical—try just signing up, test *one* feature, and let us know how fast you cashed out!! Because in 2025, “passive income” might be a tap away (and I’m still in denial).

The interviewer messaged me in the middle of the night asking to reschedule for tomorrow evening. They apologized and explained there was some confusion, but I this is not the first time I saw chaos in the recruiting process.

Fyi this role is supposed to be highly coveted and is tied to an organization that has a great name brand, but they failed to hire once and this is already past their scheduled start date.

My sweet boy Sasha (1,5y) has been staying with my boyfriend’s mom at her house every time we go out of town or on holiday. Never had an issue before. He always eats normally, plays and uses his litter box. He goes there maybe once in every few months, but I think frequently enough for him to remember the place. This time we are gone for a week, brought him over as usual, and he was fine the first day. After the first day though, he started pooping under her coffee table, in one specific spot, and only eats at night when the lights are off. Usually he eats 4 times per day. He pees in the litter box. He doesn’t want to play and only sleeps, and when the night comes he becomes active and starts destroying her furniture. She took him to the vet right away, obviously because this is not normal for him. Everything was fine, but the vet said this very much seems like he is very stressed. Why is he suddenly so stressed to be there? I’ve been trying to think of reasons since he’s always been fine before. A while ago we took a small trip, and he came with us, and was very stressed in the car but otherwise at the AirBnb that we stayed in for 4 days he was fine. Could he be traumatised from that trip or something? Or could it be that he never really liked staying there and is just showing it differently this time? I’m relieved to know he’s not ill or anything, but I’m trying to think of reasons for this. Also, appreciate any advice I can give her to make him feel better. I told her not to force feed him or anything, and not to forcefully try to play or pet him if he seems unwilling. Poor kitty must hate me for leaving him :( Thank you 🩷

1nbp6fs,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1nbp6fs/i_attended_church_i_will_return_and_report/,I attended church - I will return and report,"In this post, I'll give some context and then, point out things I observed with my takeaways, and close with some of my thoughts, feelings, and impressions.

Context
I was on a trip with my father and he wanted to attend church. He fully knows I don't attend anymore. I went to spend time with him and also because check out was at the same time as church. I didn't have anywhere else to go. I'm 35M, married with a little family.

Observations 
It was fast Sunday. When I realized this, I sighed. Testimonies can really run a spectrum. I thought about what a testimony is (as it was taught to me): a declaration of truth. I think it's silly that people are advised not to share stories or gratitude along with their declarations of truth. 

I remember as a member, I was told that it's actually healthy to fast once a month. I wonder if there is any truth to this?

The Bishop accidentally announced the wrong sacrament hymn. My dad leaned over to me and whispered, ""he got the wrong number! But the church is still true!"" To me, it was obvious that he was heavily hinting that leaders make mistakes but the church remains true. I had no reply.

A lot of people came up and introduced themselves and asked about us. They gave us suggestions about the area, since we were tourists, and they were overall very friendly. One sister gave us big hugs. One member added, ""we call her sister hugs."" While I don't like hugs from strangers, I appreciate a ward with character. I miss the community and everyone with their quirks.

The hymns were beautiful. None of them were about Joseph Smith and they really focused on Jesus. I'm atheist but one of my biggest complaints of the tscc is it's focus on Joseph Smith.

The hymns... I realized I really miss singing. I'm not good at it but singing with other people was amazing. I wish I could just sing with people for no other reason than to sing together. 

The testimonies were good. Lots of stories and gratitude, which, if I recall, is discouraged. But I like stories and gratitude! No one testified ofnthr book of Mormon or Joseph Smith. Most people testified of feelings the savior's love. One person testified of the Bible. From my time as a tbm, I don't remember that happening often. 

The sacrament came to me and I declined. I thought about saving face in front of my dad, but something I value is being true to oneself. I'm done pretending I'm Mormon. So I declined. As a TBM, having to decline the sacrament caused me so much shame. This time, I didn't care what anyone thought. 

Conclusions
Overall, it was a nice meeting. Everyone was friendly (probably because they didn't know I was only there because my ride was).

I heard a phrase awhile back: the people are perfect but the church isn't. I believe this more and more. I don't mean to minimize anyone's experience in the church (for example, I've never gone through SA). In my experience, the church takes advantage of good people. Just so much free labor from callings alone. The way callings work is not healthy! It's detrimental and it hurts people and families with how much time and resources and money to have to devote to do well at a calling. And then to constantly question if you're doing enough. The church promises blessings and happiness if you serve, give the church your money, don't drink coffee... The church takes advantage and abuses people.

Lastly, sitting in church I realized the survivorship bias that TBMs purport. 
My parents, when I was a teenager, struggled a lot. Making ends meet, career, having lots of kids, etc... the way my dad tells the story is that they stuck with it. They kept doing the church things (word of wisdom, tithing, church callings , etc.) and the Lord blessed them immensely. Personally, I believe things would have worked out regardless of their devotion to the church's commandments. Hence the survivorship bias. 

Anyway, if you made it this far, thanks for reading and have great week.

Anyways my question and concern about caffeine and alcohol. This morning I got some breakfast to go and totally forgot I took my vynvansr and ordered an iced coffee (~95mg of caffeine). Is that okay for me to drink? Or should I just toss it? 

A bigger concern is that it’s my friends 21st birthday today and we were planning on drinking later tonight. I took 60 mg of vyvanse at 6:30 am today. And we were going to drink a little at 9pm and past that. We were just going to have a few beers and a few shots. Just a light buzz to celebrate and have a little fun. But I’m concerned as I looked up that that is not a good idea. But my question is since I took it early (vyvanse) can I drink later or is that a bad idea. Also my friend whose birthday is today also takes vyvanse and he has 70 mg each morning. As well with the coffee, are these bad ideas???

I have a lunch meeting this week with a regional staffing manager and a staffing lead from a company I applied to in July. They told me over email they were going to offer me full time and last week called me and asked me if I’m still interested in working with the company and they will be in my area meeting with clients and want to get coffee or lunch to discuss contracts.

I also have been working with my mom’s newly formed business over the summer, however she has been underpaying me with no timeline for when I’ll be paid for all my hours. Just when the business has better cash flow. She lets me live rent free while searching for full time work so in essence the missing wages could be like rent.

In August, looking for paid bridge work, I applied to a mail handler job with a nearby USPS facility and received a conditional offer. I almost completed the background check but USPS wants your entire employment history without omitting anything under legal penalty. I entered in my mother’s business but felt hesitant about submitting the forms as they would likely contact her and it would be an awkward issue explaining why I am reluctant to continue work there. I felt like I am ungrateful for what she has provided me- allowing me to live at her house rent free after a lay off and paying me a little while assisting her business, and this will just stir up conflict as we are living under the same roof.

I ended up not completing the forms and am no longer being considered for the position. 

I could apply for a different role I guess. At this point I guess I’ll wait to see how the lunch turns out.",1,1757341260.0,jobs,2,1.0,False

My girlfriend and I are heading to Gdańsk from Sept 14–19 after finding super cheap flights from Germany. I wanted to surprise her with a fun little vacation before university starts again in October (it'll be a surprise to where we are going till we are at the airport, she just nows vacation inside of europe and general weather to pack properly).

I’ve spent quite a bit of time reading itineraries, blogs and Reddit threads to put together a rough plan for our 4 full days in the city and I’d love some feedback from locals or people who've been to Gdansk to make sure we haven’t missed anything.

*Disclaimer:* I used ChatGPT to help me structure the following part of the post nicely so it’s easy to read, but all the ideas came from my own research and not simply asking it ""what to do for 4 days in Gdansk"".

\---

# Trip Overview

* **5 nights / 4.5 days** in Gdańsk (late evening arrival on the 14th, early departure on the 19th)
* Staying in an apartment on **Wyspa Spichrzów**, right near the Old Town
* Goal: A mix of chill sightseeing, museums, good food, strolling around, and one proper night out
* We’re both **vegetarian**, but really excited to try Polish food

# Planned Activities

We want to keep things flexible and swap days around depending on weather and energy levels.

# Activity 1: Gdańsk Sightseeing Walk

Classic first-day stroll:  
Golden Gate → Ulica Długa → Dlugi Targ (Neptune Fountain & Town Hall) → St. Mary’s Basilica → Mariacka Street → Motława Riverfront → Green Gate → Gdańsk Sign → ~~Amber Sky Ferris Wheel~~ (edit based of the comments: supposedly non existend atm and reopening next year)

# Activity 2: Museums

* WWII Museum – absolute must-do (planning \~3-4 hours)
* Optional add-ons depending on mood:
   * Amber Museum
   * European Solidarity Center

# Activity 3: Sopot / Tri-City Day Trip

We’ll plan this spontaneously depending on which day has the best weather.  
Focus on Sopot:

* Monte Cassino Street
* Crooked House
* Sopot Pier + beach walk
* Coffee or drinks by the water

If time/energy allow, maybe a quick hop to Gdynia as well.

# Activity 4: Malbork Castle Day Trip

* Train is \~30 min each way.
* Spend 3–4 hours exploring with the audio guide.
* Back to Gdańsk for a relaxed evening.

# Activity 5: Night Out

I am unsure which day is best since we’re only there **Monday–Thursday**.  
Looking for a mix of good pubs/bars — not necessarily clubbing, though we wouldn’t rule it out if the night goes that way.

Places I’ve gathered so far (with vibe as I understand it):

* **Pułapka** – craft beer, very highly recommended
* **Labeerynt** – another strong craft beer spot
* **Cafe Lamus** – quirky and cozy
* **No To Cyk** – cheap shots, local vibe
* **Red Light Pub** – fun, friendly atmosphere
* **Lumi Shot Bar** – Polish vodka shots
* **Flisak ’76** – creative cocktails

Would love feedback on this list or other recommendations, especially since it’ll be during the week.

# Looking for Feedback On:

* Are we **missing any must-do activities** or should swap anything out?
* Which **weekday night (Mon–Thu)** would be best for going out?
* **Food recommendations** for breakfast, lunch, or dinner that have good vegetarian options. Feel free to recommend specific dishes as well!
* **Pub/bar suggestions** with character and good drinks — anything we might have overlooked or that are on our list and should be avoided.
* If you know about **local events, concerts, or gatherings happening Sept 14–19**, we’d love to hear about them! Especially things we wouldn’t find in a standard travel guide.

\----end of the ChatGPT part!

With meeting said, I'm pretty much fine with doing mostly whatever you would want to do. I'm not really picky on most things just a few (I make a list). But I would like to meet in a public place first since of course we are strangers, something like getting a bite to eat or getting a drink (boba or coffee or whatever) first would be nice. But I guess I should say a bit more on what l like and don't.

There's a long list of things I like to do but I don't feel like writing a biography. So here's a handful of things I like to do, I like going to museums and looking at the art (obviously) and imagine what the painter was thinking along with what the painting means to me or you, seeing movies in the theatre's (or relaxing at home with a nice blanket and watching them), window shopping and looking at all the things that I can't afford or just shouldn't buy, trying new foods (not much I haven't tried already but there's some), listening to music 24/7, going to concerts, and lastly getting boba or tropical smoothie.

Disclaimer: It's probably long, and I'm not a native English speaker.

I'm 36 F and my husband is 38 M. We got married last year in August and welcomed our daughter in October. She's about to turn 1 and is such a blessing! However, I am not happy with my husband's contribution to family life, and I told him, he's on probation for the next year. Should I find that he has not stepped up his game, I'll kick him out. It's my desperate attempt to get him to listen to and act on what I've been telling him for the last 6 months.
Now I need unbiased feedback on my approach to things. My family and friends are taking ""my side"", but they also only heard me complaining when things get tough. 

My husband - let's call him Peter - is a wonderful person. He's a professional musician, he loves travelling, we can talk for hours on end and in general we have a huge overlap of things we enjoy together, but also things each of us enjoys alone, but we can tell the other one later. I love him. I would also like to throttle him. He's terribly unorganised, cannot keep the flat clean or pick up after himself, forgets or delays tasks and cannot get up before 10 am. And that's f-ing early for him and requires a lot of work on my part. He's basically a teenager in behaviour when I need an adult partner. 

Let me give you some examples to paint a better picture.
On Mondays and Friday's he needs help with his work (Info: he doesn't have to be present, it's mainly sorting paper and calling his students). I'm still on maternity leave, so I have time. He begged me to help, and I agreed on the condition, he take care of the child in the meantime. Peter usually works from early afternoon until the evening. So I do my helping in the morning. If I can manage to wake him up and functioning while prepping the child. And let me tell you, that's a task! Not only does Peter repeatedly forget to set an alarm, but he also outright ignores it when he does. I have to wake him every 5 minutes until he's not asleep, but starting holes into the ceiling, trying to find the will to get up. He's not a morning person. Once Peter is on his 2nd or 3rd coffee, the baby and I are already through 2 diapers, breakfast, 1 book and sometimes a morning nap. Then I go and start on his paperwork at around 11. It irks me tremendously that he cannot prep himself, so I can go do something he asked for. 

The other days of the week are no different. Tuesday and Thursday morning, I take our girl to a playgroup (9-10.30am), and Peter's usually still asleep when we return. 

All things before noon, I basically do alone. All the while trying to get some housework done. The simple things, but most of the time, our place looks like a mess. Toys left and right, dirty dishes and piles of washing. I feel horrible about it. Like a failure as a woman, wife and mother, thinking that other people manage their household with one or more children. I struggle immensely. How much I can get done depends hugely on my daughter's mood (try folding the laundry when the child's constantly crying and only stops in your arms) or nap time (I can load and unload the dishwasher stealthily like a ninja). My husband sometimes cleans the kitchen during the night, but there's also a 50 % chance he raids the fridge and leaves the cheese out. 

I do the laundry, the hoovering, the bathroom cleaning, the trash, the mopping, and the administrative work (insurance, contracts, etc). All the while, the list of things that need to be cleaned or done, if I ever find the time, keeps growing and weighing me down. The only task Peter regularly does is grocery shopping. 
And I feel that's not enough. I feel overwhelmed, but so does he. 

And here's where I'm not sure if I'm asking too much. Peter is struggling. He's obviously overstrained with his work. It's all he does. Apart from the time he's away teaching, he's preparing lessons, writing invoices, preparing taxes, and whatever else. When he comes home, he needs ""office time"", and sometimes we go to bed while he's still in front of the computer. He even falls asleep in his office chair or on the couch, like 4 out of 7 days. He complains about neck and back pain, blood pressure spikes or drops, dizziness, and nausea. (Yes, obviously, I told him to go see a doctor, sleep regularly and IN bed, eat - which he doesn't - and cut back on alcohol and cigarettes)

I have no idea what to do, and I feel mean to threaten him like that, when he's already in over his head and physically unwell. But at the same time, he wanted a child. We tried so hard, had 2 miscarriages. He visibly adores his daughter, however he also has to parent her. Do the hard parts, go to the doctor's appointments at 8am or calm her when she's crying and I and the b00bs are not there. I want to take an everything-shower every once in a while or do some yoga, you know? Something to make sure my mental health stays intact. I dread thinking about how things will or will not work next year, when I get back to my job. Which pay's more than his, so not going is not an option.

Thank you for reading. It was already cathartic to get this off my chest. 

EDIT: people have asked if this is new behaviour for him and no, not quite. He was always unorganised, but that didn't matter so much to me back then. As an office manager I was organised enough for both of us and I had the time and headspace before becoming a mother.  

However, he his sleepiness wasn't as severe and he also used to take an active part with household chores.

Maybe it's also worth mentioning that he's not from my country, which is the country where we are living. Therefore I do the administrative stuff. He's been living here for 10 years, we've been together for 4 years.",15,1757341171.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,28,0.86,False
