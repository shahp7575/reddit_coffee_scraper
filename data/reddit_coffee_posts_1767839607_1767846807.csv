Setting 0 seems coarser than the chart I’ve found online.

Setting 8 appears around 1200 microns, which is my starting point for pour-over based on the grind sizes my local roaster publishes.

I did a test run this weekend using just an induction cooktop powered by my battery bank. 

It worked flawlessly. Boiled water for coffee in 3 minutes. Cooked pasta for dinner. Used way less battery than I expected. It feels so much cleaner not having open flames in such a small space.

the sega detroit iie initially shipped with a seemingly impressively large library, with games like House M.D.: The Game, Spongebob x Sonic XXX, Game Console Simulator, BangHo LoveTime Sexy Times Game, Git, Unreal Tournament 2003, Video Game, Californication: The Game From The Music Video, Sonic 1, Microwave Game, This Is Shovelware, Internet Connection Wizard, Sex I; 3: Piston, and SimCoffee

however, the sega detroit iie was such a failure around the world, only selling 16 units out of 28,294 manufactured, that sega had to donate all of the remaining stock & games to the people of uganda as a tax write-off

though at first they were grateful for the games, they were quick to realise that the system was such shit that the prime minister of uganda signed a law into effect that would ban the sega detroit iie and its lineage nationwide, ordering the destruction of every detroit iie and related item

for their offence, the president and chief of sega was ordered to be arrested & hung publicly, though this would never come to fruition due to uganda having no extradition treaty with japan",1,1767846590.0,lies,0,1.0,False
1q7271c,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q7271c/should_i_26f_ask_out_my_mechanic_41m/,Should I (26F) ask out my mechanic (41M)?,"Thoughts on whether my mechanic is interested in me?

Backgrounds: he is 41 and I’m 26. Four years ago, I brought my car to him and he fixed it. We talked for a while in his shop because he had some religious images on the wall and we realized we practiced the same (somewhat unique) faith. At the time I was a full time nanny so I had a car seat in my car. He likely thought I was older than I was (I was 22) because of the car seat - probably thought I was a single mom. He appeared to be in his mid 30s and mentioned being a dad. He texted me “happy Sunday” the weekend after he completed the repairs. I ghosted him because I freaked out that he seemed so much older than me… even though I was attracted to him and probably did give cues I was interested (smiling, keeping the convo going). So that’s the background.

Flash forward 4 years, I have a new car and a new cell phone number. I brought my car to him due to transmission issues, and the mechanic I was previously working with couldn’t fix it, but I knew this guy could. When I brought my car in he gave me a friendly side hug but we didn’t acknowledge whether we remembered each other. He gave me another side hug when I came to the shop to check on something. One time while visiting the shop (to discuss my car - it has a lot of problems!) he said “wow, you’ve been out of a car for awhile… you need it for work or for school, right?” And I said “what?” And he said “you need it for school? You’re young, aren’t ya?” And I smiled and said “I am, but I need it for work.” 

Another day while in the shop, he mentioned his birthday was the next day. I asked if it was a milestone birthday, and he responded “nope… that was last year. I’ll be 41 tomorrow.” When I left that day, I left my business card sitting in the car so he’d know I’m a working professional with a business and not a student. The next day, I texted him a happy birthday gif, and he responded kindly, “oh my
Gosh, thank you, getting a lot of love
Today. I got your car card :)” I’m assuming the car card meant my business card but maybe it related to the car gif I just sent for his birthday. Seems like a stretch that he clocked that I left the business card on purpose… but it also seems odd that he would say “I got your car card” referring to the gif… who says that upon receiving a birthday text? Like, clearly you got it lol. 


A few days ago, I texted him and told him a funny story that my rental car broke down - it’s funny because the rental had the same issue my car is having back home. I told him in was in Florida. He responded “oh my goodness” and when we talked on the phone about my car a few days later, he asked me about the weather in Florida. 

All of his Google reviews are really good and highlight how friendly he is, so maybe I’m delusional. But he had interest 4 years ago? He is remaining more professional this time around but he’s still warm… he is still responsible for my car and he is (probably?) realizing the age gap is larger than he thought, so I doubt he’d ask me out unless I made it VERY clear I was okay with it. 

Am I delusional? Could I invite him for a coffee once my car is fixed? 
(No… the age gap doesn’t bother me anymore. I don’t need any lectures on this).

Please help,"Everything was fine with our GE fridge/freezer until the past ten days.  I noticed there was water in the fruit bin, which seemed really odd because the only other thing in the fruit bin was coffee in sealed bags (unopened). I removed the coffee, dried up the bin and moved on. The next day I noticed a small pool of water on the (new!) wooden floor, at the bottom of the right front corner of the fridge. It was not deep but there was enough water to make a small circle. This worried me so I turned off the ice cube feature, dried up the water on the floor, and then I remembered I had filled the Pur water filter in the wee hours and I thought it was possible I had simply spilled the water on the floor. The fridge and surrounding area were dry for the next few days. But now tonight there is an almost identical circle of water on the wooden floor--maybe slightly larger and deeper-- on the floor of the left front corner. I tried to wedge my fingers under the machine to see how far back the water went and it was dry past my knuckle. So the water is shallow and in front of the fridge. (The first leak was on the freezer side and that is why I turned off the ice cube maker.

There are three other factors that may or may not be relevant: it has been pouring rain here  for days; we have three cats; AND we have had a contractor fixing the heating for about a week. Are any of these three things relevant? I tend to think not but I am desperately hoping we do not need a new fridge. Can this sort of leak be repaired? The water does not smell like cat urine at all, but the cats are skittish when strangers are in the house, and we have had two contractors in and out of the house during the exact same time as the leaks. I see no possible way the cats could have peed in the fruit bin though! And I don't think the rain has gotten in through the floorboards. But the floors are newish and this is the first heavy rain we've had since they have been installed.

1q71yor,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1q71yor/got_catfished_3_times_got_mad_built_something/,"Got catfished 3 times, got mad, built something about it","So here's the story. Got catfished three times on dating apps and finally snapped.

The first one was obvious in hindsight - reverse image search found her on a Brazilian model's Instagram. Two weeks of great conversations, totally fabricated person.

Second time was sneakier. Photos were real... technically. Just 10 years old. Showed up to coffee and genuinely didn't recognize her.

Third time broke me. Even video called once (camera was ""glitchy"" of course). When we met, nobody showed. Later found out the photos were AI-generated. The whole person was fabricated.

After that I went down the rabbit hole. 72% of online daters have been catfished. Over a billion dollars lost to romance scams last year. And dating apps don't verify photos because it would hurt their engagement metrics.

I'm a software engineer so I started thinking about this technically. The solution hit me: cryptographic signatures. Same tech that secures your bank transactions. What if you could sign photos at the moment of capture, creating mathematical proof that:

1. Photo came from this device
2. At this exact time  
3. Hasn't been modified since

If you edit one pixel, the signature breaks. Can't fake it, can't AI around it.

So I built it. Called it Proofmi. Take a photo, it gets signed instantly. Anyone can verify it with one tap.

After Jaxon Reid got rejected by the hottest girl on campus, he paid me to be his ""personal simp.""  
  
  
My job? Kiss his ass 24/7, worship the ground he walks on, help him pick up the pieces of his shattered ego.  
  
  
After busting my ass for weeks, that ice queen finally got jealous—just like we planned.  
  
  
Mission accomplished. Time to get paid.  
  
  
I whipped out my phone, pulled up Venmo: ""Alright boss, PAY UP!""  
  
  
But Jaxon grabbed my phone, held it hostage.  
  
  
""How about I just keep you instead?""  
  
  
Wait—WHAT?  
  
  
\---  
  
  
The night Jaxon confessed to the campus it-girl was wild as hell.  
  
  
Word was, he'd worked three jobs for months just to buy a thousand roses.  
  
  
And what'd she do? Tucked her hair behind her ear all graceful and turned him down with the sweetest smile:  
  
  
""Jaxon, why? Dropping cash you don't have on some grand gesture... honestly? It doesn't make me feel special. Just stressed.""  
  
  
That night, the school Reddit blew up:  
  
  
\[How does some broke-ass like Jaxon even THINK he's got a shot with her?\]  
  
  
\[She's literally too nice. Bet she's so done with these clueless losers but look how classy she still is!\]  
  
  
By evening, everyone had bounced from the field.  
  
  
Just Jaxon, standing there alone.  
  
  
He chain-smoked for like half an hour, then suddenly whipped around and went to kick that massive pile of roses.  
  
  
""YO, WAIT—""  
  
  
I yelled.  
  
  
His leg froze mid-air.  
  
  
Lost his balance, wobbling like crazy before finally pulling back.  
  
  
He looked up at me through half-shut eyes. Didn't say shit.  
  
  
I jogged over, all hyped: ""Dude, if you're not keeping these, can I have 'em?""  
  
  
Jaxon frowned, annoyed as hell, then turned and walked off.  
  
  
I grinned so wide my face hurt. Threw off my jacket and scooped up as many roses as I could, even though the thorns kept stabbing me.  
  
  
Hauled the whole thing over to the street fair next to campus.  
  
  
""Roses! Fancy imported roses! Not $199, not $99—today only NINE BUCKS! Come get 'em!""  
  
  
I worked part-time at a flower shop.  
  
  
The roses Jaxon used tonight? Yeah, I delivered those.  
  
  
A thousand roses at $199 each.  
  
  
My boss wanted to give him a discount.  
  
  
Jaxon said no: ""My love doesn't need a discount.""  
  
  
My boss was THRILLED to find a sucker like that.  
  
  
Told me after the delivery, I could clock out.  
  
  
When I saw the address was our campus, I stuck around.  
  
  
Figured I'd see who the lucky girl was.  
  
  
No surprise—Sienna Monroe, the girl everyone wants.  
  
  
She'd been the goddess since day one of freshman year. Gorgeous, classy, perfect. Guys were always falling over themselves for her.  
  
  
Guess Jaxon was no different.  
  
  
I'd heard his name before.  
  
  
He was famous mostly 'cause of his face.  
  
  
Tall, sharp jawline, built like a Greek statue. Hot in that cocky, in-your-face way.  
  
  
But supposedly, dead broke.  
  
  
That's why everyone called him the ""hot but broke guy.""  
  
  
Except I'd seen him drop $200K at the flower shop without blinking.  
  
  
Making that much in three months? What kinda job was he working... and how sketchy was it?  
  
  
It was Valentine's Day, so the street fair was packed.  
  
  
Tons of girls selling roses.  
  
  
But basic red roses had nothing on my premium starry collection.  
  
  
My phone kept going off: \[Venmo: $9 received.\]  
  
  
Sweetest sound ever.  
  
  
I was in the zone, making bank, when Jaxon rolled by on his motorcycle.  
  
  
Planted one long leg on the ground, stopped right in front of my stand.  
  
  
Stared at me with this weird look.  
  
  
Then my phone chimed: \[Venmo: $9 received.\]  
  
  
I panicked—wanted to cover my phone's mouth.  
  
  
Jaxon's eye twitched. He shot me a thumbs-up:  
  
  
""Bold move.""  
  
  
Then rode off.  
  
  
When I had like a hundred roses left, Jaxon came back.  
  
  
But this time, no bike.  
  
  
He rolled up in a flashy blue Aston Martin.  
  
  
The engine roar made everyone jump.  
  
  
He waved me over: ""Get in. Gotta talk.""  
  
  
I shook my head. ""Can't. Still got flowers to sell.""  
  
  
""I'll buy the rest.""  
  
  
With that, he pulled out his phone, scanned my code.  
  
  
\[Venmo: $19,900 received.\]  
  
  
Holy SHIT.  
  
  
This guy was the purest sucker I'd ever met.  
  
  
Buying back his own damn flowers at full price? Iconic.  
  
  
I grabbed what was left and scrambled into his car like a happy puppy.  
  
  
Jaxon took me to this bougie lounge in downtown Boston.  
  
  
""What's your name?"" He spun his keys, eyes flicking over.  
  
  
""Vera Calloway.""  
  
  
""Alright, Vera. You need cash? Got a gig for you. You in?""  
  
  
""Not selling my body or my dignity.""  
  
  
He snorted. ""You? Not interested.""  
  
  
Then he said tonight's rejection crushed his pride.  
  
  
So he wanted to hire me as his obsessed fake girlfriend.  
  
  
Payback time.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
""Why me?""  
  
  
""You're the most shameless girl I've ever seen. Perfect for this.""  
  
  
""Why'd you pretend to be broke if you're loaded?""  
  
  
His ears turned red. ""Got tired of ass-kissers in high school. Just wanted to be normal.""  
  
  
Being normal's fine—plenty of people are.  
  
  
But when you look like THAT, ""normal"" doesn't fly.  
  
  
Hence the nickname.  
  
  
And tonight? Totally wrecked him.  
  
  
""Screw being the broke hot guy,"" he muttered.  
  
  
""Vera, I need you to simp for me. Hard. Every time, you get paid. Five grand a month base.""  
  
  
""We signing a contract then?""  
  
  
""Yup. Starts tonight.""  
  
  
We signed for six months.  
  
  
That same night, I posted on Instagram:  
  
  
\[Can't stop thinking about you... Jaxon Reid, do you even see me?\]  
  
  
Pic attached: me clutching those hundred roses, looking totally lovesick.  
  
  
Everyone had already seen that field of roses from earlier.  
  
  
So people recognized them instantly.  
  
  
Someone screenshotted my post, threw it on the campus subreddit.  
  
  
Comments were BRUTAL:  
  
  
\[Is she for real? Picking up roses someone else rejected? Where's her self-respect?\]  
  
  
\[A simp for a simp. Vera's literally bottom of the food chain.\]  
  
  
\#Jaxon Reids Simp Vera trended immediately.  
  
  
Didn't bother me one bit.  
  
  
I screenshotted it, sent it to Jaxon.  
  
  
\[How's that? Good enough?\]  
  
  
He sent ten grand: \[Not bad. Keep going.\]  
  
  
\[Bringing you breakfast tomorrow. I'll be outside your dorm at 6 a.m. Everyone's gonna be SO jealous.\]  
  
  
He sent back a glowing thumbs-up.  
  
  
I smiled—now THAT'S what you call professional.  
  
  
Next morning, I showed up at his dorm with a whole spread, waiting bright and early.  
  
  
People walking by whispered:  
  
  
""Look, that's shameless Vera.""  
  
  
""Damn, she's really out here this early. Girl's got NO pride.""  
  
  
Ignored them, pulled out my vocab app.  
  
  
Jaxon didn't come down till almost 8.  
  
  
I lit up, rushed over: ""Jaxon! Got you breakfast. Wasn't sure what you liked, so got everything.""  
  
  
His voice was ice: ""Don't do this again. I don't feel that way about you.""  
  
  
I blinked back fake tears: ""Liking you is MY choice. You don't gotta feel the same.""  
  
  
The guys behind him looked like their eyes were gonna pop.  
  
  
""Damn, bro's got GAME!""  
  
  
""Wait, isn't that Vera? Top of her major? And she's simping THIS hard?""  
  
  
Jaxon grabbed the food, tossed it to his boys: ""Here. Yours.""  
  
  
""Thanks, bro!""  
  
  
Then they all walked off.  
  
  
Left me standing there, biting my lip, looking heartbroken.  
  
  
Once they were gone, I pulled out my phone.  
  
  
\[How was that? Pretty good, right?\]  
  
  
He sent five grand: \[Oscar's yours.\]  
  
  
Jaxon: \[Got an early class in Harrison Hall tomorrow. Save me a seat.\]  
  
  
\[You got it!\]  
  
  
After his Aston Martin showed up last night, everyone knew he was loaded.  
  
  
So my simp title got upgraded: gold-digging simp.  
  
  
Next day, got to the lecture hall early, saved him front-row center.  
  
  
Perfect view.  
  
  
When I looked up, saw Sienna walk in—white sweater dress, looking like a Pinterest board.  
  
  
She seemed to glance my way.  
  
  
But I'd just spilled my latte on my jeans, too busy wiping to notice.  
  
  
Jaxon strolled in right on time.  
  
  
I waved like crazy.  
  
  
He saw me, looked pained, glanced toward the back, then sat down all reluctant.  
  
  
""Boss,"" I said, grinning.  
  
  
He Venmo'd me without a word.  
  
  
Then hissed: ""Vera, I said save me a seat. Why the FRONT?""  
  
  
""Huh? Where'd you wanna sit?""  
  
  
""Back row, dumbass.""  
  
  
""Back row needs saving?""  
  
  
""Obviously!""  
  
  
Then ignored me.  
  
  
I poked his arm: ""Boss, your dream girl's sitting behind us.""  
  
  
His face shifted. Shot me a look: ""Quick, simp NOW!""  
  
  
Simp Mode: activated.  
  
  
I opened a latte, stuck in a straw, held it to his lips.  
  
  
He took a sip, shoved me away, all cold.  
  
  
I stared at him with puppy eyes, giving everyone behind us a perfect view of my tragic face.  
  
  
Then unwrapped a chocolate, tried to feed him.  
  
  
He just kept spinning his pen, ignoring me.  
  
  
I tugged his sleeve gently.  
  
  
Before he could say anything, the professor up front lost it:  
  
  
""If you're gonna flirt, do it OUTSIDE! Don't turn my class into a circus!""  
  
  
Everyone burst out laughing.  
  
  
I ducked my head, wanted to die.  
  
  
Professor wasn't done: ""Miss, you're not even in this major, are you?""  
  
  
Next thing I knew, I was covering my face, running out.  
  
  
The class roared. Someone banged their desk.  
  
  
Hit the subreddit within minutes.  
  
  
\[Does Vera have NO shame? I'm embarrassed FOR her.\]  
  
  
\[Jaxon drives a $7 mil car and looks like THAT. Of course she's clinging on.\]  
  
  
\[Gold-digger. Simp. Pathetic.\]  
  
  
I screenshotted, sent to Jaxon.  
  
  
\[Boss, check it. Working like a charm. And when I ran out, saw Sienna glaring. Know what that means? She's regretting rejecting you. Boss, we're IN.\]  
  
  
He sent twenty grand: \[Don't get cocky. That's when you mess up.\]  
  
  
\[You got it, boss!\]  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
Saturday afternoon, there was a basketball game.  
  
  
Jaxon was starting lineup.  
  
  
As his loyal simp, obviously I had to show up and cheer obnoxiously.  
  
  
Stood courtside holding iced coffee: ""Go Jaxon! You got this!""  
  
  
He pulled off his jersey, showing off his ridiculous shoulders.  
  
  
Me and every girl there screamed.  
  
  
He smirked, tossed the jersey right at my face.  
  
  
Something sharp in the pocket damn near took my eye out.  
  
  
Hurt like hell. Eyes watered instantly.  
  
  
Fumbled, dropped my coffee. Spilled all over my chest.  
  
  
I was wearing a light blue shirt.  
  
  
Stain spread fast—my shirt was see-through now, and everyone could tell.  
  
  
Embarrassing as hell.  
  
  
Whistle blew. Crowd cheered.  
  
  
Game started.  
  
  
I stayed hidden under his jersey for a sec, then carefully pulled it on backward to cover up.  
  
  
When I finally peeked out, I'd blinked back tears, slapped on my usual goofy smile.  
  
  
""Go Jaxon! Love you!""  
  
  
He glanced over, eyebrow raised, lips curling into this dismissive smirk.  
  
  
Someone caught that, posted it immediately.  
  
  
\[LOL Jaxon looks disgusted and she STILL simps.\]  
  
  
\[She's wearing his jersey now? Desperate much?\]  
  
  
\[Actually pathetic.\]  
  
  
Halftime. Jaxon jogged over for water.  
  
  
I handed him the coffee.  
  
  
He took one sip, face darkened.  
  
  
""Who said you could wear my jacket?""  
  
  
Tone was sharp. Actually pissed.  
  
  
""Wait, my shirt got wet—""  
  
  
Before I could finish, coach yelled for him.  
  
  
He shot me a warning look: ""Vera. Don't cross the line.""  
  
  
We'd done this routine so many times—me simping, him being cold.  
  
  
Everyone ate it up.  
  
  
But this time, I knew he wasn't acting.  
  
  
He was genuinely mad. The look in his eyes? Real contempt. Real mockery.  
  
  
And underneath, this cold, cutting stare—like he saw right through me.  
  
  
My spine went cold. Wave of humiliation I hadn't felt in forever crept up.  
  
  
I clenched my fists, texted my roommate Iris.  
  
  
\[SOS. Spilled coffee on my shirt. Can you bring me something?\]  
  
  
Iris: \[Babe, I'm out but just saw Landon. I'll have him bring you a jacket.\]  
  
  
\[You're a lifesaver.\]  
  
  
Few minutes later, Landon showed up.  
  
  
Voice soft, warm: ""Iris said you needed help. Didn't want you catching cold. Here, take mine.""  
  
  
With that, he pulled off his cardigan.  
  
  
I'd been holding Jaxon's jacket away from my body the whole time—scared to get it dirty. Expensive as hell, and his scent was all over it.  
  
  
Heavy. Uncomfortable. Suffocating.  
  
  
My arms were already sore.  
  
  
So when Landon showed up, I felt rescued. Quickly shrugged off Jaxon's jacket, took his cardigan.  
  
  
Landon was close. Definitely saw the stain.  
  
  
He looked away, kinda awkward.  
  
  
I pulled on his cardigan but still held it away, didn't wanna stain his either.  
  
  
Landon's face softened. Gently tugged the fabric flat.  
  
  
""Don't worry. Gets dirty, I'll wash it.""  
  
  
""Thanks, Landon.""  
  
  
Eyes stung. Almost cried.  
  
  
""Vera, you don't gotta be so formal with me."" His gaze lingered.  
  
  
Landon was a legend in Software Engineering. Year ahead of me.  
  
  
Met when I was working at a boba shop, some creeps were harassing me. He stepped in.  
  
  
Turned out same school, same major.  
  
  
After that, we kept running into each other at scholarship stuff.  
  
  
Always been kind.  
  
  
Actually, Valentine's Day, he'd texted: \[Vera, can I take you to dinner?\]  
  
  
Timing, phrasing—obvious what he meant.  
  
  
Nobody knew, but under my whatever attitude, I had this fragile, sensitive heart.  
  
  
I knew the gap between me and Landon. We were impossible.  
  
  
So I replied: \[Sorry, working tonight.\]  
  
  
Adult confessions and rejections—both can be that smooth, that forgettable.  
  
  
After that, Landon never brought it up again.  
  
  
But still looked out for me.  
  
  
Like now—shirt wet, he showed up first thing.  
  
  
""Landon, thanks. I'll wash it and give it back.""  
  
  
That was basically me saying: jacket delivered, you can go now.  
  
  
But smart as Landon was, he didn't leave.  
  
  
""No rush. Heard this game's supposed to be good. I'll wait, walk you back.""  
  
  
""Alright.""  
  
  
Wearing Landon's cardigan, finally felt like I could breathe.  
  
  
Cupped my hands around my mouth, yelled at the court: ""Jaxon's so hot! Love you!""  
  
  
Jaxon glanced over—his eyes stopped on the light brown cardigan I was wearing.  
  
  
I immediately bent into my simp smile.  
  
  
He looked away, back to the game.  
  
  
Landon watched the court, suddenly asked: ""Vera, do you really like Jaxon?""  
  
  
""Yeah!"" No hesitation.  
  
  
""What do you like about him?""  
  
  
""Hot. Rich!"" Answered with zero shame.  
  
  
""Then... I'm not that far off, right?"" Landon's gaze was intense.  
  
  
I deliberately misunderstood: ""Landon, how are you far off? Your grades destroy his, your personality destroys his—you're way better!""  
  
  
Landon laughed, but it sounded kinda bitter.  
  
  
I didn't notice—halftime ended, Jaxon walked right up to us.

1q71wnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1q71wnz/coffee_etiquette/,Coffee Etiquette?,"Hi folks, 

My job, like many jobs, provides free K-cups and creamer. It's a vet hospital, and we work 10 hour shifts, so obviously there's a lot of coffee drinkin' happening lol. I grew up in an anti coffee household, and this is my first FT job right out of college, so I have some questions about basic workplace coffee etiquette. 

1. How much coffee is too much? Is it weird to drink a Kcup every day? What about 2 most days and none others? And does this change if my coffee is about 50% creamer? It's just kroger brand, so not very expensive, but I don't want to take more than is fair. Google says the average office worker drinks 3 cups a day but that sounds crazy to me (but again, I come from a zero-a-day household! So maybe that's the norm??) 

2. Are there any other basic obvious rules of etiquette besides refilling the water once in a while and throwing out your used Kcup? I'm talking things that are so stupid you cant believe someone wouldn't know em... because if there are any, I don't know em, lol. 

Thanks!! ",0,1767845685.0,work,9,0.5,False
1q71wad,https://i.redd.it/f21z9pxnw1cg1.png,"Found My Tycoon BF's Wedding Photos—Wait, I'm Not the Bride?!","Chapter 1  
  
  
I accidentally stumble onto my boyfriend's Instagram alt.  
  
  
He posts:  
  
  
""Guys help—what do I get my girlfriend for her birthday? ?""  
  
  
Typical Damon Cross.  
  
  
Every year, he obsessively checks my favorites for ideas.  
  
  
But honestly? Five years together, I'm SO over surprise gifts.  
  
  
I want the BIG moment—movie-level romantic moment.  
  
  
Friends and family cheering as my boyfriend drops to one knee.  
  
  
So I leave an anonymous comment: ""Just propose ?""  
  
  
His response?  
  
  
""Thanks, but I actually proposed to my princess last Friday ?""  
  
  
""She said yes ?""  
  
  
My smile freezes.  
  
  
Wait. What?!  
  
  
Turns out I'm Not the Bride. I am his SECRET!  
  
  
...  
  
  
I sit there, stunned for a moment.  
  
  
Then I click back into his profile.  
  
  
There's only one photo—a man standing on a balcony.  
  
  
Soft morning light wraps around him.  
  
  
Next to him sits a wooden plant stand with my succulents and roses.  
  
  
I took that photo MYSELF.  
  
  
It was the night I had a brutal fever. Damon stayed up the entire time taking care of me.  
  
  
He wiped me down with alcohol, changed my soaked pajamas, and occasionally fed me warm water to soothe my dry throat.  
  
  
When I finally woke up in a daze, I saw him standing on the balcony stretching.  
  
  
I snapped the pic and teased him—said his back looked like Popeye.  
  
  
My fingers go numb.  
  
  
I scroll back to his reply.  
  
  
""I already proposed to my princess last Friday ?""  
  
  
Below it, another comment from him:  
  
  
""I've decided—gonna throw her a birthday party. Charter a plane, invite all her friends from everywhere, make it unforgettable. ?""  
  
  
""Can't wait to see her cry happy tears.""  
  
  
Attached is a photo of a massive living room.  
  
  
Event staff hauling in flowers, balloons, streamers—setting up the whole scene.  
  
  
Location tag: Riverview Residences.  
  
  
One of the most exclusive buildings in Manhattan.  
  
  
One unit per floor, over 6,000 square feet of riverfront luxury.  
  
  
Around $300,000 per square foot.  
  
  
We went camping by the Hudson once.  
  
  
I lay back on a lounge chair, staring across at Riverview Residences.  
  
  
""Damon, what if we suddenly win ten lottery jackpots in a row and it comes with a Riverview apartment?""  
  
  
""You could have your gaming setup, I'd have my little garden.""  
  
  
""Oh, and I heard the balcony's wider than a runway. If we have a baby, he could ride his bike out there.""  
  
  
Damon kept his eyes down, flipping the skewers on the grill.  
  
  
After a long pause, he let out a low laugh.  
  
  
""Daydreaming.""  
  
  
Back then, I thought he was teasing me for dreaming about the lottery.  
  
  
Turns out he was mocking US—marriage, kids, the whole thing.  
  
  
The truth hits too hard, too fast.  
  
  
I can't process it.  
  
  
I lock my phone and look around dazed.  
  
  
Our cramped 200-square-foot rental.  
  
  
Turn one way, you're bumping into the coffee table. Turn the other, it's the cabinet.  
  
  
The couch, fridge, TV—all secondhand.  
  
  
Manhattan real estate is insane.  
  
  
Even this dump eats up a quarter of our combined paychecks.  
  
  
We work at the same company.  
  
  
He clocks in and out with me EVERY SINGLE DAY.  
  
  
So when the hell did he have time to fall for someone else?  
  
  
Where did he get the money to buy a bare apartment worth nearly twenty million?  
  
  
I pull up Damon's contact and hit dial.  
  
  
He picks up almost instantly.  
  
  
For a moment, I don't even know what to ask first.  
  
  
I sniffle.  
  
  
His voice comes through immediately—panicked, worried.  
  
  
""Babe? What's wrong?""  
  
  
""Caught a cold? Flu's everywhere—don't go out. I'll bring you hot soup later.""  
  
  
""Why aren't you saying anything? Another tough client giving you trouble?""  
  
  
I force down the sob rising in my throat.  
  
  
""Come home. RIGHT FUCKING NOW!""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
""Okay. On my way.""  
  
  
I hang up, and the knot in my chest loosens just a little.  
  
  
All these years together—all it takes is a slight frown, a soft whimper, and Damon panics.  
  
  
No matter where he is or what he's doing, he rushes to my side.  
  
  
He always knows how to make me smile again.  
  
  
That's right.  
  
  
That's my boyfriend. That's Riley Bennett's man.  
  
  
The photo must be a coincidence.  
  
  
Just a guy with a similar build, similar setup. There are millions of people like that.  
  
  
Not long after, Damon rushes back, clearly in a hurry.  
  
  
""Sorry babe. Did I keep you waiting?""  
  
  
He sets down a bag of cold medicine.  
  
  
Then he pulls out a thermos of hot soup and carefully spoons it to my lips.  
  
  
The sweet, warm broth slides down my throat and pools in my chest, soothing the ache.  
  
  
But then I catch it—a flash of color peeking out of his pocket.  
  
  
A ribbon.  
  
  
The SAME kind used in that blogger's girlfriend's birthday setup.  
  
  
My chest feels like it's been hit hard.  
  
  
All the shock, the doubt, the heartbreak I'd been trying to suppress comes flooding back, crashing over me in waves.  
  
  
All these years, Damon's given me EVERYTHING I asked for.  
  
  
Except one.  
  
  
Marriage.  
  
  
He always says we're too young.  
  
  
Says he doesn't make enough to support a family yet.  
  
  
Says he's not ready to be a father.  
  
  
And me? I spend years defending him to my mom every time she calls to rush me into marriage.  
  
  
Turns out he wasn't opposed to marriage.  
  
  
He just didn't want to marry ME.  
  
  
""What's on your mind?""  
  
  
""You're usually chattering away. Why so quiet today?""  
  
  
Damon reaches out and pinches my cheek.  
  
  
I stare at him, my heart splitting open.  
  
  
I always tell my friends not to be stupid in love.  
  
  
The second a guy shows signs of cheating, leave. No hesitation.  
  
  
But now that it's happening to me? I can't let go.  
  
  
I choke up.  
  
  
For the first time and the only time, I try to hold on.  
  
  
""My mom's been pushing me to go on blind dates back home.""  
  
  
""I'm 29, Damon. Back home, women my age already have kids in preschool.""  
  
  
""She says there are a few guys—good jobs, decent people, parents with pensions. Stable. Safe.""  
  
  
I pause.  
  
  
Damon's hand freezes mid-air, the spoon of soup hovering between us.  
  
  
His smile hasn't fully faded yet, but it stiffens completely.  
  
  
""But—""  
  
  
I wipe away my tears messily and grab his arm, forcing a smile.  
  
  
""I told her off. I said I'm only marrying Damon Cross!""  
  
  
""We met in college, fought our way through New York together, dated for FIVE damn years.""  
  
  
""When a client bullied me, you grabbed a bottle and smashed it over his head for me.""  
  
  
""When I lost my job and couldn't afford food, you supported me without a second thought.""  
  
  
""When I broke my leg, you carried me up and down twelve flights of stairs every single day just so I could get some sun.""  
  
  
""I gained weight recovering. You lost weight instead.""  
  
  
""There's NO way you don't love me. No way you won't marry me.""  
  
  
""My birthday's coming up anyway. Maybe you're planning a surprise.""  
  
  
""I told my mom to wait for the wedding wine—she'll get to brag to every single relative.""  
  
  
""Damon, you—""  
  
  
There's so much I want to say.  
  
  
So much hurt I want to let out.  
  
  
But my throat closes up, and all I can do is tilt my head back and stare at him, stubborn and desperate, waiting for him to say something.  
  
  
Damon's hands hover uselessly, wiping at my tears.  
  
  
But they just keep coming.  
  
  
His hands drop.  
  
  
After what feels like forever, he finally speaks, voice hoarse.  
  
  
""Riley... now's not the right time.""  
  
  
""We need a house first, don't we? I haven't even saved up enough for a down payment.""  
  
  
I shoot to my feet.  
  
  
I tear through drawers and closets, pulling out every bank card I have.  
  
  
I lay them all out in front of him, one by one.  
  
  
Then I grab a calculator and start adding everything up, my fingers trembling over the keys.  
  
  
The tiny room fills with cold mechanical beeps.  
  
  
$80,000 + $67,000 + $120,000 + $35,100 + $183,000...  
  
  
Total: $485,100.  
  
  
Damon Cross, money is never the problem. It's YOU!  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
I look up at him, smiling through tears.  
  
  
""It's enough. I swear, it's enough!""  
  
  
""We don't have to stay in Manhattan.""  
  
  
""We can move back to my hometown—Riverside.""  
  
  
""Houses there are much cheaper. What we've saved is enough to buy a small two-bedroom outright.""  
  
  
""My mom can help with the baby. After work, we'll go over for dinner. Her oast turkey is incredible, Damon. You'll love it.""  
  
  
I want to rip my heart out and show it to him.  
  
  
To show him that for five whole years, ALL I ever wanted was a future with him.  
  
  
But what about him?  
  
  
Why is he silent?  
  
  
Why isn't he pulling me into his arms right now, telling me he's been waiting for this moment too?  
  
  
Why isn't he saying, ""I only want to marry you, Riley. No one else.""  
  
  
""Say something!""  
  
  
I shove him hard.  
  
  
The red in my eyes startles him. He panics, pulls me into his arms, gently patting my back.  
  
  
""Don't cry. Why are you crying? I never said I wouldn't marry you. It's just—""  
  
  
""Then quit your job tomorrow. Come home with me for the holidays. Meet my parents.""  
  
  
I cut him off, my voice desperate.  
  
  
I can't give him any more room to make excuses. To back out.  
  
  
I don't dare give him even one more chance to stall.  
  
  
After a long, suffocating silence, he whispers.  
  
  
""...Okay.""  
  
  
I break into a tearful smile.  
  
  
I cling to Damon, rambling all night—what gifts my parents like, how to deal with my gossipy aunts, how sharp-tongued my childhood friends are...  
  
  
I don't even remember when I fall asleep.  
  
  
Until a blast of cold air jolts me awake.  
  
  
Damon stands on the balcony, his back to me.  
  
  
His voice is soft, indulgent.  
  
  
""I know, babe. I'm sorry. I'm coming over right now.""  
  
  
He hangs up.  
  
  
I can't name the feeling twisting in my chest. I just instinctively close my eyes and pretend to sleep.  
  
  
He whispers my name softly.  
  
  
When none comes, he presses a kiss to my forehead.  
  
  
Then he slips out, quiet as a ghost.  
  
  
The second the door clicks shut, tears slide silently down my face, disappearing into the darkness.  
  
  
Why?!  
  
  
Why do I have to swallow my pride, play dumb, pretend I don't know—and he still has to break me like this?  
  
  
I get up.  
  
  
Almost on instinct—numb, silent—I follow him.  
  
  
No surprise—his car pulls up right in front of Riverview Residences.  
  
  
Damon walks straight into the center tower.  
  
  
The elevator stops at the 27th floor, card access only.  
  
  
I turn and step into the pitch-dark stairwell.  
  
  
I've always had terrible stamina.  
  
  
Even my 800-meter fitness test senior year—Damon had to drag me by the hand to finish it.  
  
  
He used to tease me that without him, I wouldn't have even graduated.  
  
  
Twenty-seven floors feel endless.  
  
  
My stomach cramps so badly I can barely stand.  
  
  
Still, I grip the railing and refuse to stop.  
  
  
Like self-torture, I'm desperate to see the truth with my own eyes—bloody and undeniable.  
  
  
Panting, I finally stand in front of the heavy door.  
  
  
I take a deep breath.  
  
  
And ring the doorbell.

I've come to find that I need to support myself with more community.

I do enjoy the amount of time I spend alone. helps me gain a better understanding of myself (I think). though I think I need to carve out more room for some friends and social interactions.

Often I find I'm faced with the lack of community in times of growth, fear, enjoyment, and celebration. it's made me feel sad that im missing a meaningful component. I know I'm missing the aspect of different perspectives, shared experience and ultimately wisdom through connection. Especially not having lots of women in my life as of now. While Those realationsips have always been the most impactful to me 😪

That being said,

perhaps reading this you can relate, share stories of your community, and how you’ve built it.

If you are reading this in Salt Lake. I would love to get up to some friend activities.

I am quite low effort and would love to make some new female friendships. So let me know if you are a woman/girl/she of slc. we could each watch the same movie (chipwrecked, random generated movie or if you have a suggestion) then we would gather notes and meet at a coffee shop or similar third place and share thoughts. It would be nice if maybe 1 or 2 cigarettes are had - on just my end or both whichever). again super low effort just throwing out some ideas.

I wanted to post this here for any useless luker that might see Muaaa

* Subbies wake up exactly when I tell them to and small sends every hour on the hour until I allow the wastes of space to go back to sleep. I want proof that I’m the only thing on their pathetic minds all day.
* Wake me up with coffee tribute, ofc. And another tribute for chocolates. Who doesn't want chocolates on Valentines day? duhh
* Piggies will post a public confession of devotion admitting they are just a lonely, pathetic loser spending Valentine’s Day serving me.
* They should spend an hour making a handmade Valentine’s card, then they'll send me a photo of it, then rip it up or burn it on camera. For this, they must send a tribute to apologize for thinking a cheap piece of paper was ever enough for me.
* Count every red object in their house, $1 send for every item found.
* They should plan a video game date. On mommas day, I shouldn't be the one planning, show some proactiveness... Depending on the game, I’m going to find a creative way to drain the NPCs while we play.
* Pick anything they want from Throne, not ony for me, but for Mr. S (my beautiful kitten). Subs should show respect not only to me, but to the only other creature above myself.
* Valentines Day is strictly denial day. The piggies spend the day spoiling me, but they aren't allowed any relief for themselves. Watching me get what I want while they get nothing is their only purpose.
* I’m going out, and the subs are covering it. They’re paying for my shopping, my manicure, and even the love hotel for my date. If I’m feeling gentle, I might send a pic of the lingerie the piggy paid for. Mommy needs fun, and it’s going to be sub-funded. They should know mommy will go for those men that are really handsome and ""kinda enough"" to satisfy her a little bit, subbies are worthless cuckolds that only exist to workship their alpha goddess and watch her, watch other males.
* Pay for a high-end dinner or takeout.
* A small send for every piece of chocolate or treat i eat throughout the day.
* Ending the day with handwritten, numbered lines: ""I will keep my mouth shut and my wallet open"" or smth like that. We don't stop until I see the pets' handwriting getting barely legible. Once their hand gives out, they pay a fee for being useless and lazy af and then we take the number they stopped at, multiply it by 10, and that’s the final send of the night.

Go to sleep little piggies, no relief until goddess wants. If you're lucky might be tomorrow.",1,1767845494.0,u_Putrid_Finish_3274,0,1.0,False

1q71tg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/RHONY/comments/1q71tg5/a_day_in_the_life_as_sonja_morgans_intern/,A day in the life as Sonja Morgan’s Intern,"🌅 8:30 AM — Arrival at the Morgan Townhouse

You creep up the steps to Sonja’s townhouse, gripping your free coffee, nervously rehearsing “Yes, Sonja?”
Before you can knock, she flings the door open in full glam (leopard print, of course) and announces you’re late. You glance at your phone — you’re actually five minutes early — but this is Sonja Time now.  ￼

She hands you a clipboard with 17 tasks and a sparkly pen, then asks if you’ve gotten your brioche water schedule sorted yet. You… what?  ￼

⸻

🧴 9:00 AM — Intern Training Begins

Sonja gathers all the interns for a “serious meeting.”
Topics include:
	•	How to light candles for good vibe energy (vital).
	•	Why organizing eyelash sets is important professional development.
	•	And the subtle art of telling Ramona Singer to ramotional her problems away.  ￼

One intern asks if this counts as real work. Sonja beams and says, “Darling, you’re getting your Master’s in Sonja-ology.” You’re not sure that’s a real degree, but you nod.  ￼

⸻

☕ 10:30 AM — Errands, Sonja Style

Task #1: Fetch Sonja a coffee — but not just any coffee. It must be a double macchiato with extra foam, and she will text you mid-walk to “tell you how to order it correctly.”
Task #2: Pick a restaurant where Sonja will strategically be seen tonight (because food taste doesn’t matter — exposure does).  ￼

Halfway back, Sonja calls. “Not foamy enough! And why is this iced?”
You swear you saw your dignity evaporate in the Starbucks queue.

⸻

📦 Noon — Miscellaneous: The Tasks Get Weird

Back at the townhouse, tasks now include:
	•	Washing… something weird in the bidet (details murky, dignity gone).  ￼
	•	Sorting through Sonja’s “brain energy pill” stash and not mixing them up with the “poop pills” (yes, that’s literally a conversation you have).  ￼
	•	Taking note of Sonja’s deep life lessons, like “Don’t wear leopard unless you’re willing to own the jungle.”  ￼

An intern whispers: “Does this look like a real internship?”
Another whispers back: “Shhh, this counts as a case study in chaotic enterprise.”

⸻

🍾 2:00 PM — Prep for Party Time

Sonja needs help preparing for tonight’s cocktail soirée.
You are now:
	•	Folding napkins artistically.
	•	Debating the cultural import of leopard print with another intern.
	•	Googling why you signed up for this internship again?

Sonja pulls you aside and says, earnestly, “Interns don’t charge me — my attorneys do. My interns listen sometimes, but the attorneys never do. So it’s a win/win.”
You consider becoming an attorney instead.  ￼

⸻

🌆 4:30 PM — Intern Debrief (Sort Of)

Sonja gathers you around and asks what you’ve learned.
You might say:
	•	“How to write a check like it’s 1995.”
	•	“That ‘international luxury lifestyle brand’ is probably code for extremely curated chaos.”
	•	“That leopard is, in fact, everyone’s neutral.”  ￼

She smiles proudly. You pretend you’re proud too.

⸻

🌃 7:00 PM — Evening: Party Support

As the party kicks off, your duties expand to:
	•	Pouring champagne with grace under pressure.
	•	Handing Sonja a fan because the glam must prevail.
	•	Observing high-level philosophical discourse on whether toast points should be stale or fresh.  ￼

At the end of the night, Sonja hugs you and says, “You were fabulous!”

1q71ot3,https://i.redd.it/nkaumd5yu1cg1.jpeg,I built a caffeine tracker / sleep analysis app specifically for the Apple Watch. Giving away some free lifetime subscriptions for feedback!,"Hey,  r/ProductivityApps ,

To introduce myself, I’m a CS student heading into my third year and I love to workout. One of my worst habits is consuming pre workout late in the day. Most caffeine trackers have their Apple Watch apps hidden behind a paywall and didn’t really offer the customization / features I was looking for.

The app:

Visual Decay: it uses a decay formula to calculate your active caffeine half life and is completely customizable under settings.

Watch First: It works completely standalone from the watch. Log without your phone nearby.

Apple Health Integration: This was a big one because many of my family members use Apple health to track their health metrics already. So making this seamless for them to use one important to me.

Sleep Risk: it warns you if your active caffeine MG is too high for your bedtime.

The tech:

I built the app using Swift UI and Swift Data. The hardest engineering problem I faced was getting the bi directional sync to actually work seamlessly when the user changes their settings etc. Meaning the watch, widgets, and app all update together.

In a workday it can happen 1 or 2 times a day. Since I was a teen I slept in all my school/cegep/university classes. I kind of still listen in the background. I often slept at work on my desk and during meeting too, it is so embarrassing. When I drink a coffee often I will fall asleep in the next minutes. I used to draw, stim, do anytbing to try to orevent sleeping but it usually doesn't work out for long. But if I am cooking, walking, etc I won't fall alseep involuntary.

A little background - I am a CA working in Big4. I work about 13-15 hours a day from the office. Which leaves me almost no time to actually workout or hit the gym etc. 

I’m a caffeine addict so I need my morning cup of coffee. I use high protein milk (country delight) with monkfruit sweetener. 

I take a lunchbox everyday to work with some portion of salad, rice/roti and curry (mostly chola, rajma, paneer). 

Dinner, at most times is curd rice but sometimes due to late nights at work, I need to have dinner outside. Evening snacks too (sometimes). 

I need some suggestions for ways to improve my diet but in a practical way.

Hi there! I’m a 27-year-old cute and slim transwoman, living in the world of fashion and photography. I love good light, good coffee, and conversations that go deeper than small talk. Curious, stylish, and a little playful—I enjoy exploring new places and new ideas.

You can check my pics on my profile

I’m 5’6”, normal bmi, and drawn to men who are confident, fit, and masculine, yet kind and witty enough to keep up with my sass. Bonus if you’ve got that “I’ve-got-this” energy and a warm smile.
Please be conversationalist, non smoker and financially capable.

We work in land development. Some work, especially technical work, can be done at home in which hindi naman kelangan masilip ng supervisor minu-minuto yung ginagawa ko. May deadline naman na naka set, and may road map para sa mga checks ng output to mitigate risks of delays.

Pero bakit masyadong frowned-upon yung wfh? If anything, mas lalo akong hindi makapag-isip sa office. Galaw ng katabi ko maffeel ko haha. Nagkakaamuyan na rin kung sino ang pawis na galing sa labas. Ang sikip, literal na arm to arm yung armchairs namin sa isang row of table sa office setup namin na open. 

Number two, maingay--kulang ng meeting rooms. I have to put my earbuds almost the whole day just to keep the noise out and para hindi magmukhang eavesdrop-per.

Number three--may employees (whose role is different from yours) who just seem to lack respect with your time and would try to chat you up even if may ginagawa kang seryoso sa laptop mo (yung comment na, ""masyado ka namang seryoso"", wtf dude, bread and butter ko to malamang seryoso ako lol). Being distracted by nonsense things seem to be made easier by the open office setup. If nasa bahay ako, maiiwasan yung time-wasting and focus-shattering interactions because of the physical barrier.

Sobrang sayang oras ko sa office. As I type this pumunta muna ako sa nearby coffee shop para dito na muna magpakalma at magtrabaho (in a while will start na, just let me let off steam). Sinabi ko na lang na mag-eearly lunch ako pero babaliktarin ko na lang and sa office na ako magllunch ng 1pm.

...

On the other hand, if only we had chairs na slimmer. Weird lang talaga yung dikit dikit and one has to walk sideways para di matamaan ng kabilang row ng chairs. Ughhh. Let us wfh. Or let me work-from-the-coffee shop forever. I absolutely love what I do (I'm quite good at it because I love it), but I don't love the physical workspace.

1q71iz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProstateCancer/comments/1q71iz5/4_months_post_ralp_looking_for_incontinence/,4 Months Post RALP: Looking for incontinence underwear recs to help ditch the pads,"A week ago I posted about wanting to get rid of pads and I really appreciate all the love and advice you guys gave me! I took your tips and saw a more experienced pelvic floor rehab therapist.

Quick rundown of my situation. I had a robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy four months back and it left me with urinary incontinence. I’ve been keeping up with Kegel exercises, doing pelvic floor physical therapy, and taking meds for overactive bladder. My leaking has gotten way better but I still drink coffee when I’m stressed at work. I’ve managed to cut down to 1 or 2 cups, but I just can't quit it entirely.This makes me leak more during the workday. Having to dash to the bathroom nonstop to change my pad is so awkward. My therapist said not to rely on pads too much and suggested I try to wean myself off them by mixing pads with reusable incontinence underwear first. Funny enough my wife suggested the exact same thing a while ago. 

So I’m here to ask if anyone has tried reusable incontinence underwear? How was your experience with it and did it actually help? Can you recommend any good brands? There are way too many options online and I’m totally overwhelmed. Thanks again everyone!

1q71hua,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q71hua/the_oak_ridge_inheritance/,The Oak Ridge Inheritance,"On April 2nd, 1989, my Momma died in her sleep. She was 82 years old. My brother Benji found her lying on her back with her eyes closed. I found Benji screaming, hunched over her cold body and slapping her corpse, big fat crocodile tears running out his wide eyes as he pleaded with her to wake up. I calmed him down, told him I’d call the doc, and sent him to wait in his garden. The barn needed cleaning, so after the call I worked while I waited.

It rained the day we buried her, like something out of a movie. A dull gray rain that lingered and made you feel wet even beneath your umbrella. Benji’s tears were all spent by then though; he’d done his crying before the rains, where everyone could see it. He didn’t talk for twelve days straight after that, like back when he was a little. On the evening of the twelfth day, he up and told me he was gonna clean the barn tomorrow. When I got up the next day, I found him swinging from the rafters. I’d stepped outside for my morning coffee and a cigarette, and saw that the barn doors were still open. I crossed the small yard that lay between the farmhouse and barn, passing Benji’s garden along the way. He’d just planted a few days before Momma passed, and already growth was overtaking the small plot. For all his faults, at least he’d had a green thumb.

The barn smelled of hay and dried dung and old timber. The wood came from the forests that once grew around the property. Our family had long since cut and sold all the timber, starting all the way back when Grandpa acquired the land. We were some of the first to settle in these parts, and the barn was likely one of the oldest ones in the state. The wood from the forest was good and stiff, as sturdy as a man could ask for. Benji’s body was stiff as a board when I cut him down. He landed in the hay. It sounded like a bag of flour, a low, dull thud. He kicked up dust when he landed, dust that caught the morning light passing through the open barn doors. I sneezed as I climbed down the ladder and inhaled the dust. It got in my eyes and made them water. The dust made me cry.

I poured whiskey in my coffee as I waited for the ambulance to arrive. I waited for a good long while. Our property was way out in the boonies. Technically, it all passed to Benji when Momma died. It’s just mine now. Lily pawed at my knee as I sat waiting on the porch. She whimpered and stretched her jaw into a wide yawn. Her canines were sharp and yellow. Benji’s teeth never did come in right. The ambulance pulled up the dirt road and passed the “Welcome to Oak Ridge Farms” sign Benji and I had painted when we were children. I kept my hands in my jacket as the men approached. The responder wore his navy blues, and he had a lip swollen full with tobacco. His partner looked nervous. We spoke for a moment, then I led them into the barn.

“Why’d you cut him down?” The lead asked. His name was Rick, and I took him for the lead cause there was no way in hell the other guy was in charge.

“Couldn’t stand to leave him up there any longer,” I said.

“You really shouldn’t have moved him. The police’ll say it looks fishy.”

I shrugged my shoulders at that. It was far too late to worry about how it all looked. I stepped back outside for some air while the boys called for the ME.

About two hours later, I said goodbye to the ME as he drove off with my brother’s body. The police had their questions, sure, but I’d been drinking buddies with the chief for years. He knew me, he knew Momma, but most importantly, he knew Benji.

“Damn shame,” he’d said shortly after entering the barn.

My mind was on the cattle out in the pasture, and the wheat growing in the fields. It was almost time for harvest. I had things to get done.

“He show any… signs? Ever tell ya what was on his mind?”

I shook my head no. “All he said was that he was gonna go clean the barn in the morning. It was the first and last thing he’d said since Momma died.”

The chief sighed and shook his head, “Damn shame.”

I walked the chief out to his car. He rolled his window down before driving off.

“I know you’re going through a lot right now. Just… take some time. Swing by in a few days, and we’ll get the paperwork squared away. I’ll go ahead and let the county clerk know you’ll be by soon, for the property transfer, and the dissolution of that, er, what was it called again?”

“Conservatorship,” I said quietly. “I’ll be up later, get it taken care of.”

“Right. You take care now.”

I watched the chief pull away, his truck kicking up a trailing ribbon of dirt that spiraled into thin clouds before settling in the grass on the sides of the road. He’d had a look in his eye, hadn’t he? A queer one? The kinda look you give a thug or an out-of-towner, not a man who’s driven you home countless times after one too many. No, no, I must’ve imagined it. I stayed outside a moment, pacing the gravel, hands laced behind my head. Thinking, ignoring the sting of sweat on my rope-burnt palms.

The paperwork all went through, and I buried Benji beneath his garden. There was some debate with distant relatives who thought he should be next to Momma. I didn’t want to do that to her, despite it all. I made sure to keep the garden intact. It was a beautiful garden.

That year was the biggest harvest Oak Ridge Farms had ever seen. Stalks of wheat taller than a man, with full heads of grain. I managed to pay off all the funeral expenses that year, with plenty left afterwards. I met a nice girl from the town over that year as well. Her name was Patty. Patty baked and sold her goods down at the local farmers’ market. She used Oak Ridge wheat for her bread and sold out every time. People couldn’t get enough of it.

But whenever I ate it, all I tasted was ash.

The herd was hit with a case of spring fever that year as well. The vet couldn’t believe it. Neither could I. Every cow that year gave birth to twins. Some even had triplets, all of them healthy and strong. The vet said he’d never seen or even heard of such a thing. The herd grew and grew, all of ‘em fat and robust. Patty started selling their meat at the market as well. We could charge whatever we wanted, and people would pay it. That’s how good everyone said the cattle at Oak Ridge Farms were.

But whenever I ate it, no matter how long I made Patty grill it, all I could taste was raw flesh and blood.

I could handle the wheat. I could handle the cattle. But what I couldn’t handle, what no one could handle, was the garden. It seemed to grow with a mind of its own, spreading every year, no matter how often I fixed the fence or trimmed the plants. Patty didn’t think much of it. In fact, she enjoyed the garden and its bounty.

“Looks like Benji’s still helping out from beyond the grave, huh hun?” She’d say with a smile. “I sure do wish I could have met him. He sounds like such a kind soul.”

I’d nod my head, but inside I knew something was wrong. The tomatoes burst in my mouth like pimples. The cucumbers cracked like bone. I couldn’t eat any of it. I couldn’t eat. Patty prided herself on preparing for each meal only what the Lord had blessed our farm with. She scolded me when she found grease stains on my shirt, or empty bags and cups in my work truck. The fast stuff was all I could eat. All I could keep down.

The worst came a year after Benji’s death, on his anniversary. I’d stepped outside to eject the meal Patty had made. I had to, otherwise it would curdle in my stomach. She didn’t know any of this. God, she didn’t deserve any of this. I’d barely made it out the door and leaned over the porch railing. I vomited right on top of Benji’s grave.

It was then I noticed the roses. They were magnificent; large flowers of deep lavender grew all across the garden. They grew as I watched, their petals blossoming, their thorns stretching longer and longer. I threw up again, and again. Their smell, their stench, was overwhelming. Like a field hit with blight. Like a dead cow left to rot beneath the sun. Like Benji’s room when he’d have an accident and Momma would ask me to help her clean it up.

In that moment, I waited for Benji. I knew he was coming. I knew I was about to pay for what I’d done. But damn it all, it was my farm. It was always supposed to be my farm. Why hadn’t she trusted me? Of course I was gonna take care of him; as if I’d abandon my only brother. To do that to me, to strip away all I had worked for and give it to an imbecile… what was she thinking? What choice did she leave me? My tears mixed with the bile staining Benji’s headstone as I waited for the roses to take me. I felt their petals lick my skin like the barbed tongue of the Devil himself. Those thorns inched near the crown of my head, and I prepared myself to die a wicked man, damned by my wronged brother, beneath the eyes of a just God.

Only Death never came. He whispered from the bushes. His voice laughed in the wind. But he never showed his face. The roses retreated, the thorns scratching my skin as they went, but leaving me otherwise unharmed. Patty found me there in the morning. My clothes were soaked with sweat, and she said I was shivering like I’d been out in a winter storm. I don’t remember any of it.

I still can’t eat the food. I take no joy in the fruit of my labor. But I no longer care.

Because there was another voice that night apart from Death’s.

And it said,

“I love you, Bubba.”

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited.

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

About half way in Newtown he directed me to an office building. Well no high building but a commercial one. 

""This is yours for your accounting building. Enough offices for bookeepers. Lockable file cabinets. A canteen area fir coffee and lunches.""

""Once the BBQ for volunteers they will deliver 3 picnic tables for your courtyard. Contact your bookeepers and get them setup. I also got you a receptionist to help you manage. You just have to choose a name for your business.""

He handed me 20 identical keys for the main door and left me to set up 

I sent a message to all bookeepers and told them to meet me here.

A lady came in 15 minutes later and introduced herself as Victoria and as my new receptionist.

She set up her Tablet at the reception desk at the front. When the bookeepers started coming in she welcomed them to Lady Rachel's accounting company. They were directed towards me. Once 5 were in I gave them a tour and eventually gave them a space. To set up their desk.

Anna somehow found out about my new office and brought two flower arrangements. One for reception and one for my second office. My main one is city hall. 

Spent the day at the office. We received a coffee machine and industrial fridge to put our lunches in. All set up.

Last Post for more details: https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/s/54XOfS32yV

I confessed my feelings to my childhood crush. It was a roller coaster ride for me. Due to my shy and introverted nature, never have I ever confessed to anyone.

She replied back saying she acknowledges and respects my message and would keep things between us.

She also agreed for a harmless cup of coffee with conditions: split bill, don’t expect anything out of it and honesty.

How should I interpret this?

1q71bhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1q71bhz/manager_from_hell_or_do_i_expect_too_much/,manager from hell or do i expect too much??,"i don’t even know where to start with this. there’s a LOT of info and soooo many different things i want to mention (mostly bc i over explain and don’t want to miss any important context) so please bare with me! im sure there’s a handful of unnecessary details in here too though

i (24f) have been working in this small retail store for over 2 years. i started as a cashier and was promoted to an assistant manager in may 2025. this is my first long term/real world job (primarily worked for my mom + odd jobs at renaissance festivals before this) so i don’t know much about management rolls or the way things typically work at these kinds of jobs. 

a little more about me: i have undiagnosed health issues and i get really bad days where it’s extremely hard to function due to migraines/nausea/overall weakness + lightheadedness. it doesn’t happen that often, maybe once a month, twice if i’m really struggling. i am also AuDHD, sever anxiety, and just a little bit fucked up overall. you know the drill. i’m open about this, especially my health issues bc i didn’t want to blindside them when i needed to call out bc of it. (i ALWAYS make sure my shift is covered if i call out otherwise i’ll still show up even if i can barely function. except for one to two instances when i first started bc the policy wasn’t clear when i was hired)

despite my problems, not to toot my own horn, but i am a an extremely hard worker and very proactive, always helping anyone where i can, looking for opportunities to better the store and take on more responsibilities, and just always looking for something productive to do. or at least that’s how i was but i am extremely burnt out now especially after the holidays. 

backstory on manager: this current manager is not the one who hired me, og manager quit after about 4 months of me working there and then they brought in the new manager (let’s call her Bitch Ass😌) from another location. everyone in the company loved her and was so excited she was coming on, we all had such high hopes for her. pretty soon little things started happening and it’s just fucking snowballed from there. i.e: her saying she’ll do things and never following through (i get things are bound to fall through the cracks, especially when starting at a new location, but now she’s been the manager for almost 2 years and still will forget basically everything you ask her to do unless you remind her multiple times). she’ll deflect and blame mistakes on her employees or the other store manager instead of taking accountability, she NEVER trains new hires and pushes it onto any other employee even if they’re just a cashier whose worked just a few more weeks than the person they’re training. one of the main things we requested when she started was COMMUNICATION bc the cashiers and assistants were (and still are) only told things the day of (if we’re lucky enough to even get the info the day we need it) and we’re always left looking like idiots bc we can’t answer basic questions about things going on in the store bc no one tells us. she’s constantly complaining when people ask her questions because she “already told everybody” (the info is typically hidden in a single extremely long and jumbled slack message), she rarely ever takes phone calls even when they specifically ask for the manager, shes almost always 30+ mins late when she covers a shift, when she covers a shift she rarely helps and is usually sitting on her ass doing nothing and again just rarely follows through. she also preaches she cares for her employees and prioritizes them but ONLY prioritizes and takes care of her favorites. (she makes it SOOO obvious who her favorites are and who her least favorites are. there’s one employee who is very sweet and very hardworking and she keeps asking for more hours + if she could sell some clothes at the store like everyone else does, Bitch Ass schedules her maybe 2-3 days a week if she’s lucky and refuses to let her sell anything, but a new employee asked her within two weeks of starting and now has clothes in the store) 

 

when Bitch Ass started, she created an assistant manager position for her bestie (we’ll call him todd) even though he was a very weak employee, always late, leaving early, taking nearly double the time for a break everyday, never checking on other employees, disappearing while on shift, never telling anyone where he’s going/what he’s doing, half assing his duties (throwing product away bc he “didn’t want to deal with talking to the vendor”) and overall avoiding any sort of task unless it was a random unimportant one he actually wanted to do. after a few months to almost a year of this, me and 4 other employees (2 of which were also assistants) brought up our concerns and frustrations with him. even after mentioning it multiple times, she still didn’t talk to him for MONTHS until the assistants talked to the owners about it but even after the talk finally happened, nothing really changed. thank god Todd eventually moved out of state so we didn’t have to deal with that anymore, but that honestly made Bitch Ass even worse bc now she’s sad her besties gone and takes it out on us. 

now this holiday season has been absolute HELL. Bitch Ass took a 2 week vacation the last week of october/first week of november during PRIME holiday prep. she literally told us she was deleting slack off her phone and would be completely unreachable. fine, take your vacation girl.  but right before she left she hired 5 new people for the holidays and barely trained them, didn’t even give some of them a code for the POS, yet still SCHEDULED THEM WHILE SHE WAS OUT OF TOWN (it was us 4 assistants and maybe 5 other pre existing cashiers who knew what they were doing) so that put a LOT of extra stress on us assistants bc we were running around trying to get things done to get products ready for the floor/making sure we have enough shit for the holidays, but ON TOP OF THAT we also had to UNKNOWINGLY train new hires. she would just put them on the schedule with us and not tell us we were training that day and NEVER tells us what they’ve been trained on already/what we need to focus on with them etc. the new hires would literally come in and be like “who’s training me” and we’d just be there like “no fucking idea🤷)

early-mid november i started really struggling mentally, i had to go off my antidepressants and was starting to get really get burnt out. i told Bitch Ass this, she did her usual “i think everyone is really struggling right now with everything going on in the world” and offered very little support. by end of november she called me to the basement for a “check in” bc “i haven’t been acting like myself and people are noticing” (im a very chipper and friendly person, my coworkers have told me that me on my bad days is essentially any normal person on their regular days, so i wasnt being mean or anything, just more quiet and reserved than usual and a little less proactive) during this chat, i was not okay mentally. she was getting mad at me for leaving a little early on a slow day (last i heard from her, she said if its slow and coworkers are fine with it, leave early to save the store money, so thats what i did.) and she was saying like “we promoted you for a reason, we thought you could do this, you need to step it up” by this point i was sobbing, really struggling with my self worth and my ability to function or lack there of. there was a day a few weeks prior where she texted me roughly 30 mins before my shift telling me i needed to train a new hire when i got there, i told her i have very little in me but i’ll do what i can. she brought that up and i expressed how i needed more time to prepare to train someone and her response was “i gave you almost an hour notice, i thought that was pretty generous, i didn’t realize you need that much time to prep” (again, ive told her about my autism and how i thrive best when i have information way ahead of time)

she also told me to think about accommodations or things that would help me and that we’ll be doing weekly check ins to make sure i’m doing okay. she also said i could leave after our chat and that she’d help the cashier on the main register so i could leave. i was feeling the slightest bit hopeful after our chat (im stupidly optimistic and oblivious sometimes) but then i went to the bathroom before grabbing my stuff to leave, when i came out, she had gone upstairs leaving the cashier on shift with a long line by herself. i didn’t wanna be a dick and just leave so EVEN THOUGH I WAS STILL SOBBING i stuck around PAST my scheduled shift to help. i finally left when we were done taking care of the line, Bitch Ass was still upstairs just chit chatting with her favorite assistant. 

remember, that check in was end of november. by the first/second week of december i realized my monday shifts are too long for me, so an accommodation would be having someone else take either the full shift or just the last half. she’s very flexible with student’s schedules and really everyone’s schedules in general so this shouldn’t be a problem. i was waiting for her to call me in for another check in (which again, was supposed to be weekly) so i could mention this to her. i wanted to bring it up before she released januarys schedule but by the last week of december, there was no check in (not even a casual “how’s it going” in passing. NOTHING. i even heard her pulling other employees to talk about their schedule for january, but fuck me i guess) so the schedule for january comes out and i text her saying “i was waiting for our next check in to talk about mondays but since the schedules out now, i wanted to bring this up blah blah blah” and she responds “i was gonna pull you for the check in monday! we can talk about it then”

that monday comes and i hear from my coworker that she isn’t coming in today due to “really bad cramps”. she never told me she wasn’t gonna be in even though she told me on saturday we would meet on monday. then, another employee comes in asking for Bitch Ass and i’m like “she’s not coming in today” and that employees like “she just told me a little bit ago she’ll be in to help me” again, no communication to me, an employee who she knows is struggling and has been BEGGING to get any heads up for anything. 

she shows up, we start our “check in” and she hits me with the “do you even like your job anymore, should we think about a different position for you?” like????? is that normal for a manager to ask if a burnt out employee wants a demotion before even TRYING to implement any accommodations first????? and the fact she didn’t check on me ONCE during the crazy season an just immediately wants to demote me. 

i’m 10000% certain i’ve been put on her shit list and i’m pretty sure it’s because i started standing up for myself and saying no when i didn’t have it in me to pick up shifts etc. i really don’t care if she likes me or not but she very clearly doesn’t lol for example, Bitch Ass gave christmas presents to all the assistants, she gave them a gift card for a coffee shop and a bonus more personal gift. i only got the gift card (mind you she gave them the other gifts IN FRONT OF ME) i also don’t drink coffee and she knows that. now i could genuinely care less if that bitch likes me or gifts me shit or anything but i’m so tired of feeling so targeted. 

this is getting so long i need to end it but one more honorable mention - she said she’s taking jan 1-2 off to clean her kitchen and if anyone calls out those days, they need a drs note. she also said she would set us up for success on those days yet failed to have anyone on call or as back up for the days she took off. on the 1st, the coworker i open with was very sick (not hung over, genuinely sick. pretty sure it was the flu bc now i have it). coworker texted everybody trying to get her shift covered, messaged the slack gc multiple times, even texted the owner that lives close enough to help. no response from anyone so she finally reached out to Bitch Ass and she responds by sending a screenshot of her slack saying you need a drs note. that coworker also has some similar health issues as me, so it really pisses me off how dismissive she is about it especially when she expects us to feel major sympathy for her when she has any small inconvenience. it’s so frustrating because yeah coworker and i might need to call out every so often due to physical or occasional mental health issues but we truly are two of the HARDEST workers in that place and get the majority of things done. if it wasn’t for us, they’d be screwed. 

i know there’s more context and situations i want to add that i’m forgetting but this is already absurdly long and i gotta stop.

but do i expect too much from my manager or is she really just that bad??? i should clarify that i don’t expect her to be my bestie or anything like that (literally fuck that) i just want her to actually care and prioritize her employees like she claims she does. i still love the store and the majority of my coworkers but she’s genuinely ruining the place for me and so many others. me and a handful of the employees that were working there pre-holidays are pretty set on leaving end of this month or next. when i leave i want to give Bitch Ass her own generic notice and then give the owners a separate one explaining that Bitch Ass is the reason i’m leaving. Coworker and i are thinking about having a conversation with the owners about Bitch Ass before i leave though bc Coworkers getting married this summer and wants to stay at the store until after the wedding. i need to leave before that for my own sanity but i also don’t want to abandon her there bc we’ve grown pretty close and she’s also struggling there.

 I already have extraverted friends but I never could manage to find any introverts to be friends with during all of the years that I have lived in St. John’s.   I was also just much more busier with work many years ago so that didn’t help my chances of finding more friends either.   I was constantly just working or distracted by it.   But I have more free time these days so I thought I would try to find some new friends again.  I am just another guy that is 38 years old and I tend to enjoy doing research often on the computer,  some amount of computer coding and computer repair, and video games.  I don’t game as often as I did in my 20s but I still play when I get enough time to do it.  I usually enjoy online RPGs , any kind of retro games from the past since I can just get them on emulator,  and medieval or fantasy style games such as dungeons and dragons.   I even like to play board games or tabletop / card games that are based on RPGs if they aren’t extremely complicated to learn.  Played a high amount of the magic the gathering card game when I was much younger as a teenager.  Only quit because it became such an expensive hobby, lol.  I have been wanting to get back into trying it again someday.   I also just like getting out of the house even if its only for something as simple as going for a walk, hiking, or going to a coffee shop.  

 

That’s about it for my brief description about myself,  I don’t want to make it way too long or we will have less to talk about later.   And we don’t have to meet right away,  just communicating online is fine until we have had more time to get to know each other.  You can choose the method of communication such as reddit chat, email, text, discord, etc.

 

I just have found that some others that I know already often just seem way too busy,  to the point where they can never reply very often to texts and they rarely even have any time for hangouts anymore either.   So that is another good reason why its best to only communicate by email or reddit messages at first.   I just need more time to get to know you and to find out if you aren’t too busy to actually have any new friendships in your life.  And you probably want more time to get to know me first to also figure out if I am the same way.  

 

Overall, you might have also noticed that alot of folks in Newfoundland in general seem very bad at staying in contact with others in general.  They tend to disappear for 2 or 3 weeks with no explanation.  Or they might only reply once a month to any kind of messages that you send to them.   I can promise you that I am not like that though,  I try to reply consistently to anyone.        

 

So we will chat more later if you decide to reach out,  take care.    

 

 

\*\*\*\*\*If reddit wont let you pm me  for any reason,  just write a comment below and ill still get back to you in the comments.   I can also use other typed chat programs or apps as well.  So I can just download some other app later for communication if you prefer to use something else.  Discord is a common app that many gamers use so I am usually on there for example.   And most apps are just free and you can download them on your phone or from the google play store.   

 

I have also not been posting very often on reddit during the last few months so my comment karma might have dropped to a very low again and be blocking some attempts at private messaging.  You can let me know if it doesn’t work though and I will attempt to fix it.  I am just reposting this ad again since reddit also would not let me reply to some of your chat requests.  Maybe the site has some glitches.  So if we still have never talked yet,  you should just write a comment here again or send a chat request and it might work this time.

1q717mu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JustThatOneGuyYanno/comments/1q717mu/episode_2_the_trophy_boy/,Episode 2: The Trophy Boy,"Emery was learning that dust accumulated faster in a magic shop than it had any right to.

She’d been working here for four days now. Four days of stocking shelves, of learning which bottles went where, of discovering that the humming boxes didn’t like being placed too close together and would start humming louder in protest until you moved them apart. (But like, why tho?)

Four days of watching the door and waiting for something to happen.

Nothing had happened yet. A few people had wandered past the windows- she could see them through the glass, vague shapes that paused and then kept walking. Not ready, Lance had said. Not yet. The shop would let them in when they needed it.

In the meantime: dust.

She ran the cloth along the edge of a display case, watching motes drift in the violet light. The tiny storm in its bell jar flickered as she passed. She’d learned not to tap the glass anymore. It got excited.

“You’re thinking very loudly,” Lance said from behind the counter.

She didn’t jump this time. She was getting used to him just knowing things.

“I’m not thinking anything,” she said.

“Mm. That’s a lot of nothing you’re broadcasting, then.”

She didn’t respond. Kept dusting.

The truth was, she was thinking. About whether this was real. About whether she’d wake up tomorrow and the shop would be gone, and she’d be back to walking the forest path with nowhere to go. About whether she was actually useful here or just… present. Taking up space. Existing adjacent to something meaningful without being meaningful herself.

Standard thoughts. Nothing new.

The bell above the door rang.

Emery looked up.

-----

The man who walked in didn’t look like he belonged here.

That was Emery’s first thought. Her second thought was that he looked like he didn’t belong *anywhere*, which was a strange thing to think about someone so obviously put-together.

He was tall. Mid-thirties, maybe. Dark hair neatly styled, expensive coat, polished shoes. The kind of person who looked like they were inportant, all clean lines and quiet confidence.

Except.

Except his eyes were moving too fast, scanning the shop like he was looking for something specific. Except his jaw was tight in a way that suggested teeth grinding. Except his hand, hanging at his side, kept twitching toward the bag slung over his shoulder, touching it, making sure it was still there.

And except for the fact that he was carrying a trophy.

Not in the bag. In his other hand. Just… carrying it. A gold-plated thing on a marble base, the kind you got for winning something important. He held it like other people held car keys or coffee cups. Casually. Automatically. Like he’d forgotten it was there.

He hadn’t forgotten it was there.

Emery could tell. She didn’t know how, but she could tell. He knew exactly where that trophy was at every moment. It was the most important thing in the room to him.

More important than the impossibly large shop he’d just walked into, apparently.

“Good afternoon,” Lance said, and the man’s attention snapped to the counter.

-----

“This is…” The man paused. Looked around. Took in the shelves, the bottles, what should have been the ceiling. “This isn’t what I expected.”

“It rarely is,” Lance said pleasantly. “What were you expecting?”

“I don’t know. I saw the sign and I just…” He trailed off. Frowned. “I don’t know why I came in here.”

“Most people don’t. That’s rather the point.”

The man’s frown deepened. He had the look of someone who didn’t like not knowing things- not in an aggressive way, but in a this is a problem to be solved way. Emery recognized it. She’d seen that look on teachers, on doctors, on her parents back when they still tried to figure out what was wrong with her.

“I’m looking for something,” the man said.

“Yes. You are.”

“No, I mean-” He stopped. Started again. “I have a problem. I heard this shop might be able to help.”

“Heard from whom?”

“I don’t… remember.” The frown again. “Someone mentioned it. I think. Or I saw it online. Or-” He shook his head. “It doesn’t matter. The point is, I have a problem, and I’m willing to pay for a solution.”

“We don’t take money here,” Lance said.

“Everyone takes money.”

“Not everyone. Not here.” Lance smiled. It was a pleasant smile. It was also, Emery was starting to realize, a smile that meant *I know something you don’t, and you’re about to find out what*. “Why don’t you tell me about this problem of yours?”

The man hesitated.

Then he started talking.

-----

His name was Daniel.

Daniel Park. Stanford graduate, summa cum laude. Valedictorian of his high school class before that. Winner of science fairs and debate tournaments and academic decathlons. Rhodes Scholar nominee. Featured in Forbes 30 Under 30 at twenty-seven.

He listed these things like a resume. Like credentials. Like proof of something.

Emery dusted a shelf nearby and pretended not to listen.

“The problem,” Daniel said, “is that I can’t finish anything anymore.”

Lance raised an eyebrow. “Anything?”

“Projects. Initiatives. I run a company- software development, B2B solutions- and I have a dozen projects on my desk right now that I can’t complete. I get them to ninety percent and then I just…” He made a gesture. Frustrated. Helpless. “I can’t close them out. There’s always something that isn’t right. Some flaw I need to fix before I can call it done.”

“And you never find the flaw?”

“I find dozens. That’s the problem. I fix one and I find three more. I polish one section and suddenly the rest looks worse by comparison. I can’t-” He stopped. Took a breath. “I used to be able to do this. Finish things. Succeed. Now I just… circle. Endlessly.”

“Hm.” Lance’s eyes flicked to the trophy in Daniel’s hand. Just for a moment. “And what do you think the solution is?”

“That’s why I’m here. I need something to help me focus. Or to see problems more clearly. Or- I don’t know. Something to make me better.”

“Better.”

“Perfect.” Daniel said the word like it was obvious. Like it was the only thing that made sense. “I need to be perfect again. Like I used to be.”

“Used to be,” Lance repeated.

“Yes.”

“When you won that trophy, for instance.”

Daniel’s hand tightened on it. Automatic. Protective.

“This? This is just- I carry this for- ” He stopped. “It’s not relevant.”

“Isn’t it?”

“It’s a reminder. That’s all. A reminder of what I’m capable of when I’m at my best.”

“And when was that? When you were at your best?”

“When I-” Daniel paused. His jaw worked. “It was a long time ago.”

“How long?”

“I was seventeen.”

Emery’s hand stilled on the shelf she was dusting.

Seventeen. He’d been carrying that trophy around- probably not literally, but in some way, in every way that mattered- since he was *seventeen*.

She was fourteen. She couldn’t imagine carrying anything for that long.

She couldn’t imagine having anything worth carrying that long.

-----

“So,” Lance said, leaning back slightly. “You were perfect at seventeen. Won a trophy to prove it. And ever since then, you’ve been trying to get back to that moment.”

“That’s not-” Daniel started.

“And every project you work on, every initiative you start, you hold it up against that trophy. Against that seventeen-year-old who hadn’t failed yet. And nothing measures up. Nothing ever could. Because you’re not comparing your work to a reasonable standard- you’re comparing it to a memory. A feeling. The high of being told you were the best.”

Daniel’s face had gone very still.

“That’s not what this is,” he said.

“No?”

“No. I have high standards. That’s all. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to do things right.”

“There isn’t,” Lance agreed. “But there’s a difference between wanting to do things right and being unable to do anything at all because nothing will ever be good enough.”

“I don’t-”

“How long have you been working on your current project? The one that’s ninety percent done?”

Daniel didn’t answer.

“How long?”

“…Fourteen months.”

“Fourteen months at ninety percent. And the one before that?”

“That’s different. That one had structural issues-”

“How long?”

“…Two years. But I shelved it because the market shifted, not because-”

“And before that?”

Daniel’s mouth closed. Opened. Closed again.

“I see,” Lance said quietly.

“You don’t see anything. You don’t know me. You don’t know what I’ve accomplished, what I’m capable of-”

“I know you’re standing in my shop at three in the afternoon on a Wednesday, carrying a trophy you won eighteen years ago, asking me to sell you something that will make you perfect again.” Lance’s voice was gentle. That was almost worse. “I know you haven’t finished a project in longer than you want to admit. I know you hold that trophy like it’s the only proof you have that you’re worth something.”

“It’s not-”

“I know you’re exhausted. And I know you came in here hoping I’d have an easy answer. A magic solution. Something to fix what’s broken without having to look at why it broke.”

Daniel stood very still.

His hand, on the trophy, was white-knuckled.

“I can help you,” Lance said. “But not the way you want.”

Silence for several seconds. Emery almost wiped the glass to her side. That would have been awkward. Glass liked to squeak. Squeaking isn’t a good way to break silence. She wiped an already clean spot on the counter instead.

“This shop deals in trades,” Lance said. “You want something, you offer something of equal value. Something meaningful.”

“Fine.” Daniel reached for his wallet. “I told you, I can pay-”

“Not money. Something meaningful.”

“Money is meaningful. Money is-”

“Money is paper. Numbers in an account. It costs you nothing to spend it.” Lance’s eyes were steady. “What do you have that actually matters to you?”

Daniel’s hand had stopped halfway to his pocket. His eyes darted around the shop- the shelves, the cases, the things on display- like he was calculating, assessing, trying to find the angle.

“I have connections,” he said. “Influence. I know people who-”

“Not interested.”

“I have property. A house in Beverly Hills, an apartment in the city-”

“Meaningless.”

“Stock options. Equity in three different-”

“No.”

Daniel’s jaw tightened. “Then what? What do you want?”

Lance’s gaze dropped to the trophy.

Just for a second.

Daniel’s whole body went rigid.

“No.”

“I didn’t say anything.”

“You were looking at- no. Absolutely not.”

“It’s just a trophy,” Lance said mildly. “Gold plate over plastic. A marble base. Probably cost forty dollars to manufacture.”

“It’s not about what it costs. It’s about what it represents.”

“And what does it represent?”

“It represents-” Daniel stopped. His voice had gone rough. “It represents the only time in my life I did something perfectly. The only time I was… enough.”

The shop was very quiet.

Emery had stopped pretending to dust. She was standing by the shelf with the humming boxes, cloth forgotten in her hand, watching.

She shouldn’t be watching. This felt private. This felt like something she wasn’t supposed to see.

She watched anyway.

“That trophy,” Lance said slowly, “is what’s keeping you trapped. You know that, don’t you? Somewhere, underneath all the justifications. You know.”

“It’s not-”

“You measure everything against it. Every project, every achievement, every moment of your life for the past eighteen years. And nothing will ever compare. Nothing can ever compare. Because you’re not chasing excellence, Daniel. You’re chasing a feeling you had when you were seventeen years old, and you will never, ever catch it.”

“Stop.”

“The trophy isn’t a reminder of what you’re capable of. It’s a chain. You’ve been dragging it behind you for almost two decades, and you’re so used to the weight you don’t even notice it anymore. But it’s there. It’s always there. And until you let it go-”

“I said stop.”

Daniel’s voice cracked on the word. He choked despite not having been drinking anything.

The shop fell silent.

-----

He looked smaller now.

That was the thing Emery noticed. He’d walked in looking polished, professional, in control. Now he looked like something had come loose inside him. Like the scaffolding was starting to buckle.

He was still holding the trophy. Both hands now, clutching it to his chest.

“I can’t,” he said quietly. “I can’t give this up, man. It’s the only thing I’ve ever done that mattered.”

“Is it?”

“Yes.”

“The only thing? In thirty-five years of life?”

“The only thing that was perfect.”

Lance was quiet for a moment.

“What about the imperfect things?” he asked.

“What?”

“The projects you abandoned. All the initiatives you couldn’t finish. The work that was good but not good enough. Did none of that matter?”

“It wasn’t finished. It wasn’t right. It doesn’t count.”

“Says who?”

Daniel opened his mouth. Closed it.

“Says who, Daniel? Who decided that your imperfect work doesn’t count? Who told you that ninety percent was the same as zero? That good wasn’t good enough?” Lance tilted his head. “Was it your parents?”

A head shake.

Your teachers? 

Nothing.

Or…was it that seventeen-year-old with the trophy, standing on a stage, believing he’d finally proven he was worth something?”

“I don’t-”

“You’ve spent eighteen years trying to live up to a child. And the cruelest part is, that child would be proud of you. The career you’ve built, the company you run, the work you’ve done- he’d look at all of it and think you were incredible. But you can’t see that. Because you’re not looking at yourself. You’re looking at him.”

Daniel’s hands were shaking.

“Give me the trophy,” Lance said.

“I can’t.”

“Give me the trophy, and I’ll show you something. A trade. The trophy for a truth.”

“What truth?”

“One you’ve been missing. One you need to see.”

“That’s not- that’s not how trades work. You said meaningful things. Equal value. A truth isn’t-”

“The trophy is meaningful to you. The truth will be meaningful too. I promise.”

“How do I know you’re not just-”

“You don’t.” Lance smiled. It was a kind smile. Patient. “But you came into my shop looking for something. You said you wanted to be perfect again. I’m telling you that’s not possible. No one is perfect. Not you, not the boy who won that trophy, not anyone who’s ever lived. But I can show you something better than perfection. Something you’ve had all along and never noticed.”

“What?”

“Give me the trophy and find out.”

Daniel stood there, trembling, clutching the only proof he had that he’d ever been enough.

Then, slowly, he held it out.

-----

Lance took the trophy and set it on the counter.

He didn’t do anything dramatic. Didn’t wave his hands or speak an incantation or pull out a magic wand. He just reached over, gently, and touched two fingers to Daniel’s forehead.

Daniel’s eyes went glassy.

Emery watched, breath held, as something happened that she couldn’t quite see- a shift in the air, a flicker at the edge of perception. Daniel swayed on his feet but didn’t fall.

Then his eyes focused again, and there were tears in them.

“What did you…” His voice was barely a whisper. “What was that?”

“A perspective,” Lance said. “Not yours.”

“It was… there was a woman. She was looking at me, but it wasn’t- I mean, I could see myself, but through her eyes, and I was-”

He stopped.

“You were what?”

“I was enough.” The words came out broken. “I was just… sitting in a coffee shop, and I was reading something on my laptop, and I hadn’t showered because I had to rush out in order to make it there on time, I think, and my hair was a mess, and I was-” He laughed, a wet and startled sound. “I was mouthing the words. I do that when I’m concentrating. I didn’t know anyone noticed.”

“She noticed.”

“She thought it was-” He shook his head, disbelieving. “She thought I was cool. Handsome. Driven. She watches me work and she thinks I’m the most incredible person she’s ever met, even when I’m not accomplishing anything, even when I’m just there, and she’s never once thought about what I’ve won or what I’ve achieved or whether I’m perfect. She just…”

“She just sees the you in front of her~” That was sing-song. Emery had read that phrase somewhere before. This seemed to fit.

“Yes.”

“For who you are. Not who you were. Not who you think you should be.”

Daniel wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. He looked wrecked. He looked lighter.

“Who is she?” Lance asked. “The woman whose perspective you saw.”

“Her name is Abigail. She’s my-” He stopped. Thought about it. “She’s my best friend. Has been since college. She’s always… she’s always been there. Even when I was at my worst. Even when I was being impossible. She just kept showing up.”

“And did you ever wonder why?”

“I thought…” Daniel laughed again, helplessly. “I thought she was waiting for me to do something impressive again. Something worthy of her attention. I thought once I finished something, once I proved I was worth it, then I’d deserve to have her around. But she wasn’t waiting. She was just… there. Because she wanted to be.”

“Funny how that works.”

“I’m an idiot.”

“You’re human.” Lance picked up the trophy, looked at it for a moment. “Which brings us to the matter of this.”

Daniel stared at the trophy. Something had changed in his expression. The desperate hunger was gone.

“Keep it,” he said.

“Are you sure?”

“No. But…” He took a breath. “But I think I need to stop carrying it around. At least for a while. Maybe forever. I don’t know yet.”

“That’s fair.” Lance set the trophy on a shelf behind the counter, nestled between a music box and a jar of something phosphorescent. “I’ll hold onto it. If you ever want it back, you can come find me.”

“Will I be able to? Find you, I mean? I knew something was up with this place when I first saw it; it wasn’t there before. I’m the only one who even noticed it…”

“Perceptive at all the wrong times.” If looked like his eye twinkled. This was a magic shop. His eye probably twinkled. “If you truly need to, yes. The shop has a way of appearing when it’s needed.” Lance smiled. “But I suspect you won’t need to. Not for this.”

Daniel nodded slowly.

He looked at the trophy one more time. Then he looked away.

“I should go,” he said. “I have a phone call to make.”

“Do you?”

“Yeah. I think I need to tell Abigail something. I don’t know what yet, but…” He shrugged. “I’ll figure it out.”

“You will.”

Daniel turned toward the door. Paused.

“Thank you,” he said, without looking back. “I don’t know what you did, exactly. But… thank you.”

“You’re welcome,” Lance said. “Take care of yourself, Daniel. And take care of her. People like that don’t come around often.”

“I know.” A pause. “I’m starting to, anyway.”

The bell rang as he left.

The door swung shut behind him.

-----

Emery stood by the shelves, dust cloth still in her hand, and tried to process what she’d just witnessed.

A man had walked in clutching the only evidence that he’d ever been worth something.

He’d walked out empty-handed, crying, and somehow looking happier than he had when he arrived.

She didn’t understand it. The logic didn’t track. If the trophy was so important to him, if it was the only thing that mattered, then losing it should have made things worse. That’s how things worked. You held onto what you had because letting go meant having nothing.

But he hadn’t looked like someone with nothing.

He’d looked like someone who’d finally put down something heavy.

“You’re thinking loudly again,” Lance said.

“I don’t understand,” she said. The words came out flat, same as always, but she meant them. “He gave up the most important thing he had. How is that a fair trade?”

“Who said anything about fair?”

“You did. You said trades have to be meaningful. Equal value.”

“I said meaningful. I never said equal.” He paused. “Maybe I said equal. I never meant equal.” Lance picked up whatever mechanical thing he’d been fiddling with earlier and resumed his work. “Value is subjective. To Daniel, that trophy was priceless- until he realized it was worthless. The perspective I showed him was meaningless- until he realized it was everything. The trade balanced itself.”

“But how did you know? That showing him his friend’s perspective would help?”

“I didn’t know. I suspected.” He glanced at her. “Humans are predictable, in certain ways. They cling to the wrong things. They miss what’s right in front of them. They build prisons out of their accomplishments and then wonder why they can’t move.”

“That’s…”

“Sad? Frustrating? Entirely avoidable if they’d just stop and think for five minutes?”

“I was going to say ‘complicated.’”

“That too.” He smiled. “But most complicated things are made up of simple steps, if you lay them out properly. Daniel’s problem was simple: he was chasing a feeling from his past and ignoring the present. The solution was simple: show him what the present actually looked like. The execution was the complicated part.”

“And you just… knew how to do that? Show him someone else’s perspective?”

“I’ve been doing this for a very long time.”

That wasn’t an answer. But Emery was starting to learn that Lance’s non-answers were often more informative than other people’s explanations.

She looked at the shelf where the trophy now sat. It looked smaller there. Less important. Just a hunk of gold-plated plastic next to a music box and a glowing jar.

“Will he come back for it?” she asked.

“Maybe. Probably not.” Lance shrugged. “Either way, it’ll be here. In case he needs it.”

“And if he doesn’t?”

“Then it stays on the shelf. Another reminder. Another story.” He set down his work and looked at her. “You’re wondering why I’m telling you all this.”

She hadn’t been wondering that, actually. But now that he’d said it, she was.

“You’re going to be working here for a while,” Lance said. “Which means you’re going to see a lot of people like Daniel. Broken in different ways, looking for different things, but all of them missing something. Part of your job is learning to see what they’re missing. Part of it is learning when to help and when to let them figure it out themselves.”

“And which was Daniel?”

“Both. He needed a push, but he had to take the steps himself. I couldn’t make him give up the trophy. He had to choose it.”

“What if he hadn’t?”

“Then he would have left with his trophy and his problem, and maybe he’d have come back someday, or maybe he wouldn’t. You can’t save people who don’t want to be saved.” A pause. “You can only open the door. They have to walk through.”

Emery thought about that.

She thought about walking through the door of this shop four days ago. About taking Lance’s hand. About choosing.

“Is that what you did for me?” she asked. “Opened a door?”

“I offered you a job. You accepted.” He smiled. “The door was already open. You just needed someone to point it out.”

She didn’t know what to say to that.

So she went back to dusting.

“In the meantime, the shelves in the back room need organizing. Those red and blue crystals are supposed to be sorted by resonance frequency, but I suspect the last owner of this shop had a different system. See if you can make sense of it.”

“Resonance frequency?”

“You’ll know when you hold them. They hum.”

“Everything in this shop hums.”

“Yes. But the crystals hum specifically. Go on. I’ll call you if another customer comes in.”

Emery went.

-----

The crystals did hum.

She spent an hour sorting them, feeling each one vibrate against her palm, trying to group the similar ones together. It was tedious work. It was also, weirdly, satisfying. Like puzzle pieces slotting into place.

She felt… at peace. And that was nice.

1q717l7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q717l7/the_man_at_the_diner_promised_to_bring_my_wife/,The Man at the Diner Promised to Bring My Wife Back,"The night was brisk and eerie. My eyelids slowly fluttered open and closed, aching from a sleepless night. I had been driving for a few hours, heading home after a business meeting, when I came across a lightly lit diner. The sign towered over the building, highlighting “24/7” in purple neon lights. I pulled in, craving the thought of caffeine.

The parking lot was littered with multiple vehicles. I opened my car door, hearing the small crash of my daughter’s little pony toy hitting the pavement. I chuckled as I tossed it back into the car.

As I made my way to the front door, I could hear the clashing of plates and laughter erupting from inside the diner. I swung the doors open and stepped in.

My ears were consumed by a deafening silence.

All the people I had heard moments ago were completely gone. I scanned my surroundings, not seeing a single soul in the building except for one man. He sat alone in the last booth, adorned in a dark red suit, staring directly at me.

He lifted a mug to his lips, took a sip, then extended his hand, ushering me toward him.

I felt intrigued, almost entranced, and found myself walking in his direction. As I drew closer, I noticed a black briefcase resting at his feet. His hair was smooth, jet black, and his skin looked unnaturally pearlescent.

When I reached the booth, I instinctively sat across from him. He slid his coffee toward me.

“Long night?” he asked.

I nodded. “I guess you could say that.”

He smiled, urging me to take a sip from the steaming mug. I did, then asked, “Do you work here?”

The man shook his head. “No. I just wait.”

I turned my head, perplexed by his answer. “What are you waiting for?”

He folded his arms. “Individuals like yourself. People who have lost something dear to them.”

I rubbed my hand through my hair, stuttering, “What… how?”

He leaned in and whispered, “I heard about your wife. Tell me about her.”

My eyes welled with tears, and I decided to let it all out. I told him everything—her smile, her courage, the joy she brought into my life. The words poured out uncontrollably: how she hated hospitals, how she died bringing our daughter into this world.

I told him about the moment the doctors informed me her death was *“*unforeseeable*”* and a *“*rare complication*.”* None of it made sense to me.

He listened like it all truly mattered.

When I finished, he folded his hands on the table.

“Do you know what grief is?” he asked.  
 “It’s love with nowhere to go.”

I swallowed hard.

“Some people don’t deserve the things they take from us,” he continued.  
 “Some mistakes shouldn’t be permanent.”

I stared at him. “Are you saying—”

He raised a gentle finger.  
 “I’m saying nothing is free.”

The diner lights flickered.

“I could bring her back,” he said calmly, like he was offering directions.  
 “Same smile. Same voice. Same heartbeat.”

I recoiled at the thought of her coming back. “How much would it take?”

He hissed, “An exchange of sorts. I’m feeling generous—an eye for an eye.”

I thought of hospital hallways. Of paperwork. Of the people who went home that night while my wife didn’t. Of the doctor who failed her and hid behind excuses.

My head shook. “I… I…”

He interrupted me. “I will take the life of the one responsible for your wife’s death.”

Thoughts of the doctor’s life—and his family—rushed through my mind. I would be inflicting the same pain onto another family.

He gently stroked my face.  
 “The constant struggling, the pain and sorrow you and your daughter have endured. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. A genuine second chance.”

I closed my eyes, vividly imagining my wife holding our daughter for the first time—the joy radiating from her. I couldn’t be the one to deny them that chance. The thought of my daughter growing up never meeting her mother crushed me.

I mumbled under my breath, “Yes… I agree.”

He smiled and opened his briefcase, pulling out a blank piece of paper and sliding it toward me. He handed me a pen and said in a deep tone, “Sign the paper.”

I indulged him and signed.

He nodded and smiled. “May we never meet again, good sir.”

He stood up, snickering as he walked out of the diner.

I sat there for several minutes in shock before eagerness took over. I bolted outside, my eyes immediately met by scorching sunlight. I turned back—only to see the diner in complete ruins.

In disbelief, I made my way to my car and eventually home.

As I opened the front door, my ears were engulfed by cries and yelps of terror. I bolted toward my daughter’s room, swinging the door open.

My wife stood there, her face buried in her palms, sobbing.

I inched closer, frozen in disbelief.

My wife was back.

But my daughter was gone.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1q716ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerassessments/comments/1q716ci/i_think_a_lot_of_career_stress_starts_before_the/,I think a lot of career stress starts before the work even begins,"This might sound minor, but I've been noticing something: how I start my day completely changes how I feel about my job and sometimes even whether I think I'm in the right career at all.

Most mornings, I used to wake up already behind. Inbox flooded, Slack lighting up, back-to-back meetings on the calendar. Before I'd even done anything, the day felt like it was running me instead of the other way around.

And here's the thing, I kept blaming the job. I thought maybe I wasn't cut out for it, or the role was wrong, or I needed better time management. But looking back, I don't think the work itself was the problem. It was that I never gave myself a chance to get ahead of it.

When you start in reaction mode, everything else follows:

* Decisions feel rushed
* Work feels heavier than it actually is  
* You end up thinking ""I'm not built for this"" instead of ""I just never set my own direction today""

Over time, that pattern starts to feel like proof that you're in the wrong place. But maybe it's not the career, maybe it's just how you're starting.

What actually helped me:

I'm not talking about some 5am miracle morning routine. Just a few small, deliberate things that stop me from beginning every day in quiet panic mode.

**1. Don't start with input**  

I used to open email or Slack immediately. Now I give myself even just 5–10 minutes of silence first. No scrolling, no notifications. Just sitting with coffee or staring out the window. It's not about meditation, it's about not letting other people set my mental state before I've even woken up.

**2. Pick one thing that matters**

Before I look at my task list or calendar, I decide: what's the one thing that, if I do it today, would make the day feel useful? Not everything — just one. It changes how I see the rest of the work. Everything else becomes secondary instead of overwhelming.

**3. Move a little**

Doesn't have to be a workout. A 10-minute walk, stretching, anything. It just signals to my brain that we're awake and active now, not dragging ourselves through the day.

4. Protect the first 30 minutes

I block the first chunk of my day — no meetings, no Slack, just focused work on that one priority. After that, I can handle the chaos. But starting with intention instead of reaction makes everything feel more manageable.

**The bigger realization:**

Career dissatisfaction doesn't always mean you're in the wrong job. Sometimes it just means you've been starting every day in survival mode and interpreting that stress as proof you don't belong.

You don't need a perfect routine. You just need a deliberate start, enough to tell the difference between real misalignment and just feeling perpetually behind.

We may be a world apart, but we're here together!*

**Welcome to the 24 hour pledge!**

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

\---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink.*  It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

Good Morning DCI!  

It’s **Thankful Thursday**!

A gratitude practice is something I’ve already mentioned and initially resisted, but have found to be really rewarding.  It’s so important to focus on the good - no matter how small.

A few things I’m frequently thankful for are quiet mornings, good sleep, hot coffee, and a clear conscious.  Today I’m thankful for a safe business trip Tuesday/Wednesday, good meeting, and being back home! I’m grateful to be working for an incredible company and although I was salty about driving nearly 8 hours in two days for a 4 hour meeting, it was worth it and nice to see everyone. I’m also truly grateful for this sub. It’s seen me through my share of stumbles and lifted me up each and every time with no judgement. It has been absolutely pivotal in my success. 

Let’s lift each other up and share what we’re grateful for!

While we’re at it, please consider hosting.  This week has been incredibly fulfilling and you never know if something you’ve been through can help others feel less alone.  Reach out to me or sainthomer to arrange to be a host!

What’s something that sobriety has given you?

Someone or something that you’re thankful for today?

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

We were together for 2 years and we broke up a year ago now. It was hard on me. She’s a good person but she did a lot wrong through the process. I understand why it happened to an extent. We’re not far apart in age but I graduated before I even met her, so she was living like me (a recent grad in the workforce) instead of like a college student.

I have never reached out to her at any point, but she routinely finds reasons to text me. Six months after the breakup, she called to tell me that she missed me. We got together for coffee and she told me that when she called, she HAD wanted to get back together with me, but that she decided she just wasn’t ready “yet”. I took that one in stride and set some boundaries while still being understanding, on the assumption that she’s not a malevolent person, just struggling.

Four months after that, and a couple months ago, she texted me out of the blue. She had previously ghosted me when I had asked her if we could finish our last conversation about boundaries, so I assumed I would never hear from her again. She texted me to send videos from a band she thought I’d like. She said that I had been on her mind and that she thinks of me often. It felt very much like she was testing the waters to see if I was angry, but then I haven’t heard from her since.

I half expected her to text after the new year. We had good Christmases together and I figured that they must remind her of me as much as they remind me of her. I feel compelled to text her or call her even if she doesn’t reach out to me. I want to tell her that I miss her and that if she plans on fixing things that she’s running out of time. If her saying that she wanted to get back together eventually was real than I need to know, and if it was lip service, I need to know that too. I feel like I’m stable enough that I could hear that she’s moved on without it crushing me because I’ve had enough time to put things in perspective. I also want to tell her that she needs to stop reaching out to me if she doesn’t know what she wants. It sets me back when I get coded messages from her and have to interpret what she might mean. If she does reach out again, I want to know that SHE knows what she wants and isn’t going to put me through the wringer again.

I thought our 3rd and recent coffee date on NYE went really well as we talked for a few hours (longer than planned,) felt we aligned on taking things slow with her being avoidant and myself being anxious, general boundaries, and she said she was still interested but going through a stressful period and wants to take it slow.

I had mentioned in person if we couldn’t meet for NY, I’d send something so she could have a drink “in spirit.” and a message after the ball dropped. I followed through on the drink which she said that’s super sweet then a few short video clips of my friends and I wishing her a happy new year. After that, she went quiet. I sent a low-pressure check-in a couple days later just saying I hoped she was okay, no rush to reply. No response.

I’m trying to understand this without spiraling into self-blame. There was no conflict, I acknowledged the things I ended up doing after coffee and the last in-person interaction was genuinely good.

My questions: Does this sound more like a pacing/attachment mismatch than me doing something objectively wrong? For avoidant or overwhelmed folks: does silence sometimes come from not knowing how to respond rather than losing interest? From the outside, would you chalk this up to timing/capacity rather than a single misstep?

I’m not planning to chase or escalate just trying to understand the dynamic so I can learn from it and move forward without rewriting myself as “too much.”

1. Start early. You will thank yourself one month before the exam if you’ve already covered the entire syllabus. Kahit at least once. May lalabas at lalabas sa isip mo pagdating ng exam. 

2. Set an alarm and have a daily routine. What worked for me is 8-12nn and 1-5pm. After. 5 pm, di na ako magaaral. Syempre hindi parating ganyan, may mga araw na hindi mo talaga kaya and that’s okay. Rest then laban ulit. Okay lang na hindi masunod ang bar schedule basta natatapos mo ang goals mo. 

3. A month before the exam date, mirror the bar exam schedule already. Gumigising ako ng 2am para masanay ako sa bar exam calltime. Isama mo na pati ligo and kain schedule. 

4. Know what kind of food makes you sleepy. During my bar review, napansin ko na nakakaantok magaral after lunch pag fried food ang ulam. Pag nalaman mo na yung trigger food mo, iwasan na during bar week during lunch. Andddd wag kumain ng bago sa panlasa mo. Kumain ka lang ng mga bagay na sanay yung tyan mo. 

5. Schedule your caffeine. Use chatgpt to schedule your coffee intake - when it will peak, and when it will crash. 

6. Take breaks. Binigay ko na sa family ko mga birthdays nila. Lagi akong present. Or minsan naglalakad lang ako sa labas. Anything na hindi law related, gawin mo para di ka maburn out. 

7. Sleep!!! Never ako naniwala sa mga all nighter. Sisingilin ka lang niyan sa umaga. During the bar week also, prioritize sleep. Kailangan mo ng lakas PHYSICALLY. 

8. Take your vitamins. Wear facemask outdoors. Ang goal is wag magkasakit. Kahit sa family gathering mag facemask ka. May naooffend dito but hayaan mo sila. 

9. Pray!

Superstitions na sinunod ko (wala naman mawawala haha): 

1. Red underwear sa lahat ng bar days

2. Eating katsudon night before the exam hahaha. Search mo belief ng japanese sa katsudon and exams. 

3. Throwing away of bar materials after exams. Syempre di ko tinapon mga libro!! Yung mga last minute tips na dala ko sa bar site, tinapon ko na pagkalabas agad ng venue. Di ko na ibabalik sa dorm ko yun. 

4. Wag lumingon sa building ng bar exam venue. Lakad ka palayoooo wag ka na lumingon ulit. 

Hope this helps! If you have any other questions, please feel free to message me. I failed during my first take and had to really strategize para di na maulit. God sees you. In God’s perfect time, it will be your turn. Good luck future lawyers. Padayon. ",19,1767842711.0,LawStudentsPH,1,0.91,False

I didn’t know they were having an affair. They got caught. He was GM, she was ASM, his wife was GM of the neighbor location and acting DM. The wife actually ended up getting fired from her location when HR got involved because she also was having an affair with an employee and they were falsifying refunds/voids for money. Meanwhile, the ASM woman I loved (lusted after in retrospect, that wasn’t love) transferred to a new location. My hours tanked I lost like 5k in 2 months. I had to get a second job it was horrible. I ended up walking off the job 3 months after everything went down cause he pissed me off one night. My patience was just gone. A few weeks later he left the company entirely. A new GM came in and disrupted everyone’s comfort…collateral damage unfortunately. A few months later I found out the ASM woman was promoted to GM of original wife’s location. Straight drama. I was pissed. I mean, beyond pissed off. She tried to fuck half the staff, the GM, her bf was a former manager from another store. She’s toxic af. I wrote a letter to HR telling them of my entire concern/experience about both of them. He was horrible to me too. 

Point being…we have no positive history and we parted on very bad terms. 

He added me (requested) late Sunday night. It kind of spun me out for a minute. He lost his job and marriage over this woman (it was a very promising job-he could have been DM in a few years easily.) They broke up in less than 2 years. I know exactly why. She can’t keep her pants on. She was sleeping with yet another employee, and my ex’s best friend. 

(Restaurant drama is the realest drama. Even Movie Theatres and Coffee shop drama doesn’t hold a candle to restaurant drama.)

Anyway, I considered accepting the request because I felt bad for him. She burned him pretty bad. The next morning I woke up and was like, I’m not going to accept his request because he’s an asshole. What has Saturn been teaching me? Boundaries! Discernment! Trust! 

He and I are not friends. Just because I feel bad for him doesn’t mean he has any good intentions towards me. Realistically, he’s probably trying to accrue internet followers for business because isn’t everyone? I declined the request. That was Monday morning. 

I open my app after work tonight and what do I see?!?!?! 

Welcome to my life everyone. 

This is not the first time an ex of an ex reached out to apologize or commiserate. Or whatever the hell he’s doing. 

I know he sees my side now, and how fucked up she was. She played a dirty game. It wasn’t just me and him…she was playing a lot of other people on/off too. That’s who she is. I’m not the bad guy, I never was. 

I don’t need his validation. 

I’m declining again. We were never friends. We left on horrible terms. He doesn’t deserve access to my life even *if* I feel bad for him because the same woman broke his heart the way she broke mine. 

I will however be sharing this story at my new job in front of the asshole boyfriend of the girl bartender who I have this dynamic with too. Same dynamic, different setting. He’ll learn his lesson about her too.

It may be because he's my child's teacher but I feel like there's more to it than that. 
We have bonded since school started-  over my child, over how my baking reminds him of his mother (who passed away), over sports and over my home renos I did. After seeing pictures of my renos he even said ""Maybe you could come help at my house"". Like isn't that normally a flirty line? Or am I crazy?! 
There's been many times where he's put his hand on my back when I'm getting ready to leave too, and we've had many personal conversations about things other than my child. I even slipped him my number when I gave him a batch of cookies before Christmas and he text me within minutes saying thank you and how much he enjoyed them (he used to just email me or talk to me in person). Anyway, I finally worked up the courage to ask him out to coffee over the holidays and his repsonse was ""I don't know, I'm not a very sociable person."" And so I took that for a no. At that point I decided that we would just go back to being normal parent/teacher when school started back up because I figured he would feel weird after I asked him out. So then the next interaction with him was at the start up of school after holidays. I sent him an email regarding my child being picked up early that day for an appointment and I addressed him by Mr. ______ and not by his first name like I had in the past. He emails me back right away to reply to what I had been emailing him about and signs the email with his first name. I then had gotten a phone call and my childs appointment was canceled so I emailed him back saying the appointment was canceled and that my child would be at school all day. I guess he didn't see that email so as I was dropping my other child off at school, I saw him and told him in person that my child would be staying the whole day. But then this guy replies back to my email like 15 minutes after seeing me and says ""Doctors! Lol"". Like we had just talked in person minutes prior. The email didn't need a repsonse at that point. 
Then at pick up time that same day, he came up close to me, chatted with me and made some jokes and then put his hand on my back again like he did before the holiday break. 
There is so much more but I could be sitting here writing a whole novel if I shared everything he's done or said.
I don't know if I'm reading too much into all of this and maybe someone has some insight to help me. Maybe he's being cautious right now because he's my child's teacher? Maybe he's just naturally flirty and friendly? Hellpppp a girl out please!!!",1,1767842586.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

And Here's What I Found,"Here’s some Context: I’m coming off of a 6 month spout of post-grad unemployment. To keep myself busy/prevent myself from going into total stasis, I went to a coffee shop, and worked on something almost every day. I’m still looking for more shops to try as I work remotely about half of the week, but since I’m not going to be able to keep up the frequency, I thought I would make this post now.

First, I’ll list every coffee shop I tried that wasn’t notable enough to say something about

* CoZie Cafe - Fair Lawn
* Better Daze Cafe - Fair Lawn
* Bogota Press - Bogota
* The Mindful Cafe - Ramsey
* SOMA Cafe - Waldwick
* Pour City Roasters - Franklin Lakes
* La Casa de Cabana - Wayne
* Queen City Coffee Roasters - Clifton
* Longfellow’s Coffee - Kinnelon
* Cloveberry - Sparta
* Cafe IDG - Lodi
* Cupily Coffeehouse - Nutley
* Halo Coffee Roasters - Springfield
* Ara Coffee - Rutherford
* Uptown Coffee - Maywood
* Qahwah House - Montclair (almost certainly the strongest coffee I had at any of these places)
* Humphrey’s Coffee - Haworth (though I do quite like the vibe there)
* Catalano Coffee - Glen Rock (I’ve gone here a few times since I live around it but between the pourover and espresso drinks I haven’t found anything that has really wowed me)
* Bergen Coffee Roasters - Ho-ho-kus
* Awe & Wonder - Tenafly (had a lot of high hopes for this one that it just didn’t live up to)
* Sleepwalker Coffee - Englewood
* Bluestone Lane - Paramus (I had this twice and I found it shockingly mediocre both times)
* Zen Haus - Ridgewood
* American Bulldog - Ridgewood/Ramsey
* L'Arte della Pasticceria - Ramsey
* Twisted Tulip - Livingston

And now, I’ll list out some of my favorites by category.

Best Food:

* Cafe Club - Montville
* Tatte - Ridgewood
* The Fine Grind - Little Falls

Best Specialty Drinks

* Paper Plane Coffee Co - Montclair
* Boonton Coffee Co - Boonton
* Cedar Beans - Cedar Grove
* Kudo Society - Teaneck (specifically the Sea Salt Iced Coffee, nothing else there was better than fine, but that drink is amazing)

I’ll give both Rey Sol in Ridgewood and Catfight Coffee in Boonton points for creativity in this one, but Rey Sol is extremely overpriced for drinks that just don’t taste that good, and I haven’t found a specialty drink I loved at Catfight.

Best Vibes:

* Hug a Mug - Pompton Lakes
* Paper Plane - Montclair
* Boonton Coffee Co - Boonton
* Thumbody - Paramus
* Iconic Coffee - Hackensack (by far the best coffee shop in the area for coworking even if I didn’t love their drinks)
* The Fine Grind - Little Falls (need to attend some of their events at some point)

And I’ll list my Top Five Favorites Below:

5. Haus Cafe - Fair Lawn: Small space, but the coffee is consistently good, I can be in and out quickly, and it’s just a dependable spot.

4. Thumbody - Paramus: Pastries are delicious, they consistently have some cool specialty drinks, and despite being in an office park on Route 4 the vibes are shockingly good. 

3. Boonton Coffee Co - Boonton: I love how large the whole space is. I can sit on those couches for hours. Plus, their specialty drinks are really good.

2. Paper Plane - Montclair: Best Coffee Drinks in the area, but seating is really tight. If you can get seating though, it’s great.

1. Cafe Club - Montville: Probably the only place on this whole search I found by just driving around, and it’s almost certainly the most well-rounded. Pretty good food, pretty good specialty drinks, a really cool location up on Boonton Avenue, and the best outdoor seating of any of these places.

I hope this is helpful to people on this forum, and I’m certainly open to hearing about spots I may have missed. I know I haven’t really scratched the surface on a lot of Passaic County and Southern Bergen County, so I’d love to hear if there’s any spots I’m really missing out on down there. We lost our coffee pot at home and have to order a new one, so I'll still have a few days of going out and trying spots.",75,1767842477.0,newjersey,20,0.99,False

The thread about nothing going on downtown got me thinking and I’m curious what people would like to see if things cost nothing and change were immediate 😂

The Smylie Brothers space is RIPE to be redeveloped into a climbing gym/roller rink/arcade- something that can work without retrofitting it too much to eliminate the noise issues.

Rotating pop up shops like the holiday one on Maple.

A late night lounge, Happy Hour-12a W-Sa. Using the old Panera space as a cozy lounge that served coffee, small plates, small bar and also had space for students to study separate from other seating spaces would be awesome. Different vibe entirely from Colectivo.

A good neighborhood bar. Ridgeville is a nice spot, but how we don’t have a place to throw darts besides Bat17 in downtown Evanston is beyond me. PLEASE correct me if I’m wrong 😂 (As much as I love Bat17’s food, I hate going in there. YMMV.)

The next picture (B&W) was near 2020, when I had years of experiences of psychiatric units, being judged and judging others and all that negative jazz finally filtered out... i felt amazing and ate amazing health foods and actually loved the way i had looked, but the journey i was on required LOTS OF GROUNDING ✍️ and i eventually had been into another psychiatric unit for my diagnosis of schizo-affective disorder, simply because i was in outer space spiritually and never grounded myself correctly in the moments i had... and also a fiendish obsession with wax cannabis (dabs) and occasional alcohol consumption. I had about a 3 year stint with off an on daily oral medications for that diagnosis and while i was in my most recent psychiatric D&MH split treatment center, I had gotten out in july of 2023, somewhere at a facility in minnesota for a 6 month long total stay, committed by a Mn Judge court. Upon completion, the next picture.... Was my heaviest weight in my entire life...

3rd pic:

298 pounds in the middle of, I believe was about the summer of 2024... maybe (brain fog from those areas in time) 
 
I felt like crap then, all-of-the-time, ate huge a** bags of party sized doritos, drank cases upon cases of soda, and additionally i had an entire almost cup and a half (cup measurements) of coffee creamer, per cup until 12 cup coffee pot was empty, filled half and half coffee/creamer.

*arteries probably close to clogged*
.
.
.
I probably haven't ever felt that bad in my entire life, had many issues breathing heavy, exhaustion from things other people would be fine with light movement... 

Then i got on medication and started adjusting them until some symptoms stopped and i could be happy with working medications.

3rd picture is relevant to me around that heavy-time being medicated, heavy heavy medications.

4th picture is relatively the same area of time, although i had begun journaling and occasionally going out in public and even with my old anxiety it was progress...

Last three pictures 📸 

ME now!!! This is myself happy and working positively on my diet! (Which healthy foods can taste good I've discovered!) 

Also *self care started often this last year of 2025!*
Showering consistently when feeling stanky :)
Brushing, flossing, scraping tongue and using oral rinse! Washing hands after #1 (always after #2 even at my worst 😂🙏) i clean up after myself, i respect myself, i have integrity, i am honest TO myself which is super important i believe. I meditate and do breathwork, and i am brave and courageous enough to do things that normally seem uncomfortable for my old cycle self and i am just super grateful and appreciative of those who believed in me, which has been a handful of friends and my family is number 1 for me.

1q70m9m,https://i.redd.it/7bogdq70m1cg1.jpeg,Week 1 (Jan 1-7) of Low-Buy,"Here is my progress during Week 1 of my low-buy. My rules are 1 clothing item per month, 1 accessory per month, and 1x under $20 dining out/week and 1x $50+ dining out per month. All other spending allowed as long as it's under my envelope daily spend budget. All necessary items for my new apartment are allowed. In general, all necessary items are allowed, even clothes. It's mainly a low clothing, low dining out low-buy, and enforcing my alcohol budget.

I am coming from 5-8 pieces of clothing per month, blowing my clothing budget by triple per month, dining out 3x/week, and blowing my alcohol budget by 30% per month.

I get a hot pink sticker for no clothing or dining out days. I get a green sticker with a heart for no clothing or dining out *except coffee*. I get a green sticker for allowed buys or under envelope spend buys. I get an orange sticker for unallowed buys or for going over an envelope day. 

Today's green sticker is because I started working out at my new work's gym this week and turns out they don't allow crop tops, but all I have are combo cropped-top/sports bras and got talked to for that, so I went to Goodwill and got two tank tops and two sports bras. 

I separately have an alcohol tracker that looks similar to this, too. 

I am feeling really good. I have a very immediate savings goal (renting an interstate uhaul) that is keeping me vigilant. I also moved into a new place with much less clothing space and so if I even wanted to buy anything new I would have no where to put it. That's keeping me on track too. 

Newly having access to a full-sized fridge is helping with preventing dining out.

1q70kkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DermatologyPA/comments/1q70kkr/new_job_offer/,New Job Offer,"Hi everyone! 

    Just received an offer letter today, would love some feedback. For background, I have 2 years experience as a derm PA in SE FL and this new job is located in the same region. I would be moving from a private equity group to a privately owned practice. As many new grad PA’s have experienced in derm, my first role was laughable and offered 90k salary (now up to 96k) with zero commission structure so I’m genuinely excited to be able to move on to something more reflective of what I have seen in this group and others. Here are the preliminary offer details: 

-115k base salary 
-27.5% commission on net collections (minus base) 
OR 
Tiered volume based bonus as follows: 
300-450 patients/month = $1.5k 
450-600 patients/month = $2.5k
600+ patients/month = $5k 
* of the above, I will be paid out quarterly whichever is greater. The reason they are structuring commission in this manner is because they have a large volume of Medicare/Medicaid patients that they are trying to diversify with more commercially insured patients but they anticipate it may take 18-24 months to see the turn around in patient population that they are aiming for. They are aware of the limitations of a % commission with this population base so they added this new volume-based bonus structure to help keep incentives appealing. Eventually, the goal is to enter a commission only model.* 
- 35% net collections on cosmetics ( minus cost of product + taxes) 
- 4 day work week (10 hour days)
- 3 weeks PTO (not including major holidays)
- $2k CME
- All costs for maintenance of licensure covered
- A verbal conversation with the CEO mentioned 401k/health insurance/Malpractice but there’s nothing specifically outlined in the preliminary agreement. I plan to clarify this. 
- 2 year contract (with a vague clause that states to pay back training costs if i terminate early, I also plan to clarify this and ask for a specific $ amount or at least a formula for how training costs will be determined as the conversations that were had made it seem like the training period will be variable depending on both mine and my SP’s comfortability in having me fly solo after acclimating to the new clinic) 
- 180 day termination notice (plan to negotiate down to 90 days) 
- 12 month 12 mile non-compete 

I believe that’s all the major stuff. Overall, I really love the vibe of everyone I have spoken to (Owner, CEO, SP). My potential SP is very young and very supportive; he expressed a desire to train me at the top of my license which really excites me as my current group is not as open minded. We met in person over some coffee and it was definitely an easygoing vibe, so I have no concerns about getting on well with the team.  

If you’ve read this far I really appreciate your time. I’m still learning as a baby PA and this will be my first big girl job hop! Let me know if anything seems glaringly wrong or if maybe I’m missing something. Thanks in advance 😄.

...........................................................................................................................................................................................

“I put in for transfer,” He wouldn’t meet the gaze of the others, opting to study the floor to great detail. He hadn’t noticed that scratch on the wooden tiles before. His chest felt as if the air had been punched out of him, leaving a void behind. Telling them this today wasn’t his plan, although, if you had asked, say, a day ago, when he was going to, he wouldn’t have been able to answer either. And that is because he didn’t know. It’s almost as if he had thought of disappearing. That idea never crossed his mind though, he wouldn’t do that to them. Not like Maddie did when he was barely 18, with no clue of what to do next because he really had no one, leaving just a note behind for him to read. Not like Eddie, who wasn’t planning on telling him he was going back to Texas again, or at least that was his thought on the matter. And not like Bobby, who didn’t have a choice, *or did he?,* and died, leaving him behind. 



He tried to shake that last thought, a new one coming as fast as the other. He couldn’t stop himself! Selfish of him to think that, that Bobby only left him behind when, in reality, he was just one of the many. Hell! He wasn’t even the one that saw him die, unlike Athena, who would have to live the rest of her life with that image engraved in her head, with Bobby’s body slowly shutting down, his face bloody, the sound of desperate coughing in an attempt of getting some air to his lungs but failing miserably, losing, collapsing, dying. Because that’s all he was now: a body buried six fucking feet underground.



“What?” 



His train of thoughts was interrupted by Eddie’s voice. His eyes were stinging, like when you open them in a pool that has just way too much chlorine, his head still down. 



“Out of the 118?” His voice was almost a whisper, still loud enough to be heard by the whole group. There was something in his tone he couldn’t quite figure out. Was it sadness? It certainly wasn’t disappointment, he knew that tone pretty well. Maybe, surprise? Whatever it was, he couldn’t decipher.This time he lifted his gaze, still not really wanting to make eye contact with anyone before giving in and letting the words fall out of his mouth. 

“It’s just a number now,” Chim seemed as if he had just been told he had hours left to live, stun and sadness clearly showing in the way his brows furrowed and tears welled up. Ravi swallowed slowly before shifting uncomfortably in his seat. And Hen, she was the only one who seemed to understand him, she always did, giving him a look of hurt  before cocking her head to the side, changing to pity, as if some sort of realization had come washing over her like a waterfall.



He had given this some serious thought before deciding change was for the best. His talk with Eddie finally convincing him of moving forward with his decision. He knew he had been distant and, maybe, a little bit emotionally unstable, but people could rely on him, Eddie could tell him he was going back to El Paso, and most importantly, they could talk about Bobby with him. In fact, that’s what he had to do! Be there for them and take care of them, like Cap had told him before he- before he… But he just had to screw everything up, didn’t he? Because instead of being the pillar they needed, he had everyone tip-toeing around him, too scared that he might break, as if bringing him up would break a dam full of cracks containing an ocean. He wasn’t fragile and he didn’t need help, at least not yet, not until everyone around him was genuinely good. So yeah, may Bobby forgive him for stepping out, but if leaving lifted a burden from everyone’s shoulder’s, then he would leave for them.



The silence between them had grown heavy, no one really knowing what to say next. Buck could feel everyone staring, and, suddenly, the magazine on top of the coffee table was particularly interesting, reading something amongst the lines of ‘The Secrets of Leadership’. However, it didn’t captivate him enough to keep him there so, instead, he left.



...........................................................................................................................................................................................

“Buck,” He couldn’t find peace, could he? He turned around leaving the mop aside, reaching for the rug in the nearby bucket.



“What?” He caught himself saying sharper than he had intended as he started polishing the rig. He certainly had a talent for messing up. Eddie looked taken aback, flinching at his words.



“What’s going on with you?” Eddie’s sharp gaze could almost cut him in half. With those deep brown eyes, that stared into his soul. He almost confessed, words weighing him down like 200 pound dumbells.

*Many things are going on, Eddie. Bobby’s dead, you’re leaving, I'm a wreck because of it and can’t even bring myself to be useful anymore!*



“Nothing’s going on, Eddie,” He gave him an incredulous look.



“You sure about that? Because I don't agree that leaving the 118 is nothing. None of this -this bullshit- is nothing, and ever since that fight we had, you’ve been acting all strange.” he spat at him.



Buck could feel the anger creeping inside him, slowly rising, putting the dam at risk. He was the last one to have the right of snapping back, after all, he was the one leaving Buck behind, not vice versa. He dropped the item as he stood up



“What’s your problem, man? Why are you so mad at me for leaving? Huh?” His voice rising as he got closer, height difference coming to notice. He could feel Eddie's ragged breathing on his face.  “You’re one to talk, leaving me behind to go back to El Paso!”

He should calm down, this wasn’t solving anything, in fact, he should just leave.



“That’s what all of this is about? Me leaving *you* behind? Are you *that* selfish that you can’t think about anyone other than yourself?” Eddie’s face showed nothing other than rage, as he followed him behind. He stopped hard on his feet, as if someone in his brain had pressed  hard on the brakes, making Eddie bump into him.

 

“No,I’m-” *tired of being the one left behind.* The alarm echoed through the station, feeling louder than it had ever been.



“We need everyone, we’re going in for heavy rescue, a goddam building’s down!” Gerrard's voice announced to everyone. It didn’t take long before the whole station was moving. He exchanged a look with Eddie. “Buckley! Get your ass moving right now!”



“We’ll talk later” And with that, he left.",1,1767841825.0,u_Glad-Hospital-5427,0,1.0,False

1q70iz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BOOKOFSAMPSON/comments/1q70iz2/autoplay_is_an_altar_giants_nephilim/,"Autoplay Is an Altar. (giants?, nephilim?)","Tom used to watch YouTube the way people watch rain.

Not to learn. Not even to be entertained, really just to keep a steady voice in the room so the silence couldn’t shape itself into something with teeth.

He had a handful of channels he rotated through history, mysteries, conspiracies, theology. And when he found Wendigoon, he latched onto it like an anchor. Calm voice. Measured pacing. The kind of tone that could walk through dark subject matter without sounding like it wanted to live there.

At first, it looked harmless. Background noise. Comfort TV.

Then it turned into a ritual.

I’m writing this because Tom is dead, and because what happened around him doesn’t feel like it ended. It feels like something got hungry… and wandered off to find another screen.

The Rotation

Tom started calling it “The Rotation” like it was a health plan.

He described it like categories were food groups necessary, balanced, carefully measured:
	•	Conspiracies
(to “stretch the mind,” he said)
	•	Death-centered narratives
(to “keep God honest,” his words)
	•	Biblical revelations
(to “train for what’s coming”)
	•	Giants / Nephilim
(to “remember what’s under the floor”)

He wasn’t joking, either. Not in the way people laugh when they say “I’m addicted.” Tom said it like he was reciting something he’d promised.

He built playlists that never ended. Autoplay was always on. He started leaving videos running when he showered, when he ate, when he tried to sleep. He said silence was “where they step closer.”

If you asked who “they” were, he’d blink like you’d interrupted a prayer.

“Doesn’t matter,” he’d say. “The videos are the doorframe. The patterns are what walks through.”

That was the first time I heard him talk like the world had a second layer.

At first, it was just annoying. Like living with someone who’d discovered a new hobby and wanted everyone to worship it with him.

Then Tom started timing things.

He’d pause videos on specific frames and stare as if he recognized the shape in the noise.
He’d rewind a sentence until it felt “even.”
He’d take notes like he was studying scripture.

One night he leaned forward, elbows on knees, and whispered:

“Do you hear that? Under the audio.”

I didn’t. I told him I didn’t.

He smiled like I’d passed a test.

“Good,” he said. “That means you haven’t been invited yet.”


The Second Audio Track

Tom started sleeping less. The skin around his eyes went gray, like old paper left too long in a window.

He stopped saying “I think” and started saying “I was shown.”

For a week, every text he sent me had a verse reference attached—no explanation. Just numbers, like coordinates:

Rev 9:6
Daniel 2:43
Genesis 6:4

And then, always, the same symbol:


He wrote it when he thought something “lined up.”

Like the universe had clicked into place.

One morning he called me—too early, voice too steady and asked a question that made my stomach go cold.

“Do you think Revelation is a description,” he said, “or an instruction manual?”

I laughed because it was early and my brain refused to treat the question like a loaded gun.

Tom didn’t laugh.

“I’m serious,” he said. “Because if it’s instructions… then somebody already built the machine. And all we’re doing is turning it on.”

I asked if he’d slept.

He didn’t answer. Then, very softly:

“It’s not just one voice anymore.”

I paused.

“In your head?”

He exhaled—not a sigh. More like someone lowering something heavy onto a table.

“They don’t sound like thoughts,” he said. “They sound like commentary. Like there’s a second audio track and I can finally hear it.”

I said his name twice.

“Tom. If you’re scared, call me. I’ll come over.”

He waited a beat too long, and when he spoke again he sounded almost relieved.

“I knew you’d say that,” he said. “You’re in the script.”


The Apartment of Screens

When I finally went to his place, he opened the door only a crack.

The apartment smelled like warm electronics. Curtains shut. The air wasn’t stale—it was heavy, like the room had been holding its breath.

And the living room was screens.

Laptop. TV. Phone. An old tablet. All playing different videos at different timestamps—different voices, different subjects—like a choir rehearsing the same hymn in different keys.

I recognized one voice immediately: Wendigoon. Tom’s “anchor.” The one he said made the worst topics feel “safe enough to look at.”

I asked him what he was doing.

“Cross-referencing,” he said.

“Cross-referencing what?”

He stared at me with that exhausted, feverish focus people get right before they faint.

“The edges,” he said. “Where the story frays.”

His coffee table was covered in pages. Not writing—mostly symbols. Spirals. Tall shapes. And again and again:

Like a stamp of approval.

One drawing looked like a ladder trying to become a ribcage.

“I used to think Nephilim were just a story,” he said. “But stories are older than bones. Stories are how things that aren’t allowed to exist still get remembered.”

He tapped the page.

“They don’t come here like creatures,” he said. “They come here like ideas.”

I told him he was scaring me.

Tom didn’t blink.

“That’s the point,” he said. “Fear is the handle.”


The File He Left Behind

After everything happened, I couldn’t stop thinking: Maybe there’s an explanation in the wreckage.

On Tom’s laptop, I found a document titled:

PLAYLIST_NOTES_FINAL_FINAL2_REAL

It was the last file opened. The cursor was blinking at the end like someone had just stepped away.

I don’t think Tom wrote the ending.

I’m copying it here as closely as I can. A few lines felt less like confession and more like instruction, so I’m leaving them out. What remains is enough.


If you’re reading this, you’re late.

I kept thinking it was obsession. I kept thinking it was grief. I kept thinking it was my brain chewing on horror like a dog with a bone. But it isn’t that simple.

It starts as entertainment. Then it becomes study. Then it becomes devotion. And devotion is just worship with different lighting.

Wendigoon was the easiest one to trust. The calm voice. The steady hand on the flashlight.

But the flashlight is still a beam.

And something can follow the beam back.

I can hear them now. Not thoughts. Not voices.

A conversation happening in the gaps.

Like when a video buffers and the screen freezes but the audio keeps going for half a second except it’s the other way around. The world keeps moving but the real audio slips through the seams.

They speak in two tones.

One that comforts, like a narrator explaining tragedy.
One that corrects, like a teacher tapping a ruler against your desk.

The comforting one says: You’re not crazy. You’re waking up.
The correcting one says: Waking up hurts. Make it hurt faster. ⟡⟡⟡

I tried to pray. I tried to sleep. I tried to shut the screens off.

But silence isn’t empty. Silence is a room with no furniture. And when there’s nothing in the way, you can finally see how tall they are.

I keep seeing them in my mind giants, not made of flesh, but made of distance. Like the space between stars got tired of being empty and leaned down to watch us.

They don’t “feed” the way animals feed.

They leech.

They pull certain feelings out of you like marrow and take it back through whatever crack they came from.

Depression. Confusion. Madness.

And the worst part?

I don’t think they create it. I think they harvest what was already possible.

They are not demons. They are not mental illness.

They are something older that learned how to ride the shape of a story.

The Bible calls them Nephilim. But that’s not a name. That’s a label we slapped on a box we were too afraid to open.

I heard one of them laugh tonight, and it didn’t sound like a mouth. It sounded like the sound a tower would make if it could enjoy watching an ant drown.

My friends came to help me. They stood in my doorway and talked like people talk when they don’t know they’re standing on a fault line.

I tried to tell them it wasn’t me.

But the correcting voice said: They’re part of the script. Cut the scene. ⟡⟡⟡

After that, time breaks into missing pieces.

I remember faces I loved confused, pleading, human.

I remember my own hands not feeling like mine.

I remember the comforting voice whispering: This is mercy. This is an ending.
And I remember the correcting voice replying: Endings are doors.

If anyone finds this: don’t go looking for “signs.” Don’t binge a playlist waiting for the pattern to click.

The pattern isn’t the clue.

The pattern is the hook.

Autoplay is an altar.

And once you’ve listened long enough… you won’t be alone in your head.

I can hear them right now, arguing about whether you’ll believe me.

The comforting one says: They’ll call it tragedy.
The correcting one says: They’ll call it content.

I think they like both.

And if you’re wondering whether this ends here

it doesn’t.

Because the last thing they showed me was this:

Giants don’t need to enter your world.

They only need to convince you to open the door from the inside.


What the Police Said

Officially, it was called a “domestic incident.” People love phrases that sand the teeth down.

There were multiple deaths connected to Tom’s apartment. Nobody wanted to repeat details. Everybody wanted to move on.

But there was one thing that didn’t make sense:

All of Tom’s screens were still on when they found him.

Not just on paused. Like someone hit spacebar at exactly the same moment across every device.

Different videos. Same frame.

A tall shape. Too tall for the room.

And the last open tab wasn’t a video.

It was a blank search bar with one phrase typed in:

how do you stop a giant from thinking about you

The cursor was blinking like it was waiting for an answer.


Sometimes I still feel watched when I scroll. Like attention is a scent trail.

So if you read this and feel tempted to go hunting for what Tom “found” to binge playlists until dawn, to stare at pauses and listen under the words

Don’t.

Because I don’t think Tom’s obsession was the disease.

I think it was the invitation.

And I think whatever answered… is still hungry.",1,1767841786.0,BOOKOFSAMPSON,0,1.0,False

1q70hht,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1q70hht/how_to_hey_google_make_a_cup_of_coffee/,"How To: ""Hey Google, Make a Cup of Coffee""","I just got my Aiden, but I was pretty upset with the connected features (no Brew Now button? Wtf). But shoutout to /u/kris33 who made the [FellowAiden-HomeAssistant](https://github.com/NewsGuyTor/FellowAiden-HomeAssistant) custom integration! I figured out a workaround using a ""Schedule +1 Minute"" hack and wanted to share the YAML for anyone else who wants a one-touch brew button on their dashboard or to trigger it via voice/automation.

### The Problem
The integration allows you to create schedules, but doesn't have a direct `start_brew` service.

### The Solution: The ""+1 Minute"" Home Assistant Automation
I created an automation that:
1.  Triggers from a simple Input Boolean (toggle) that I've exposed to Google Assistant.
2.  Verifies the `carafe_inserted` sensor is ON
3.  Calculates `now() + 1 minute` and creates a one-time schedule for that exact time with my preferred profile. 
4.  Waits 10 minutes, deletes the schedule (`s0`) to keep the device clean, and resets the toggle. This assumes you have no other schedules. Some logic could be made to only delete the latest schedule. 

### The YAML
Here is the YAML for the automation, replace [PhoneID] and [ProfileName] with your device for a notification, and the desired coffee profile:

```yaml
- id: 'make_coffee'
  alias: 'Make Coffee'
  description: 'Creates and then deletes a temporary brew schedule on the Fellow.'
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: input_boolean.make_coffee
      from: 'off'
      to: 'on'
  action:
    # 1. Safety Check
    - if:
        - condition: state
          entity_id: binary_sensor.aiden_carafe_inserted
          state: 'off'
      then:
        - device_id: [PhoneID] # Your Phone
          domain: mobile_app
          type: notify
          title: ""Coffee Alert!""
          message: ""Carafe not inserted! Coffee maker will not brew.""
        - action: input_boolean.turn_off
          target:
            entity_id: input_boolean.make_coffee
        - stop: ""Carafe not inserted""

    # 2. Create the ""Ghost Schedule""
    - action: fellow.create_schedule
      data:
        monday: true
        tuesday: true
        wednesday: true
        thursday: true
        friday: true
        saturday: true
        sunday: true
        enabled: true
        time: ""{{ (now() + timedelta(minutes=1)).strftime('%H:%M:00') }}""
        amountOfWater: 375
        profileName: ""[ProfileName]""

    # 3. Cleanup
    - delay:
        minutes: 10
    - action: fellow.delete_schedule
      data:
        schedule_id: s0
    - action: input_boolean.turn_off
      target:
        entity_id: input_boolean.make_coffee
  mode: restart
```

Now I just tap a button on my phone or say ""Hey Google, make coffee"" and a minute later the Aiden starts doing its thing. I am now trying to figure out how to trigger on my iPhone switching off ""Sleep Mode"", but it's a little more tricky than it sounds. I also want some sort of extra check to make sure I loaded it the night before. 

Hope this helps some fellow coffee nerds!

Not sure where to begin with this. I wasn't even sure what I was looking for, at first. It took some digging but this post was forwarded around enough that it got my attention. I recognize the story, the writing style and how you speak about the forest. 

I found your post Ethan. 

I have all of you to thank here, actually. We recovered Ethan's phone at the scene, screen cracked but still working. I had been waiting for the warrant to take its sweet time to come through when the notifications kept pinging on the lock screen. 

I checked into the logo where the messages were coming from, and I found this site. I'm not really on social media at all, but made my own account anyway so I can keep tabs on here. 

He'd been missing for 36 hours when I found the post. I've read it about ten times before I finally accepted it for what it is. Not a piece of creative writing, but a record. Some comments here claim this is a joke, or some hoax. 

I wish that were true. 

If you’re reading this and you’ve already read his entry, then you understand why I’m adding to it. If he’s alive, this might be the only place I can reach him. 

And if he isn’t.. 

Then I will make sure it wasn't for nothing. 

I went back to the campsite this morning.
It had already been logged, photographed, cleared of the obvious. That didn’t mean it was finished. It just meant no one else thought there was more to see. 

Ethan was careful. I knew that before ever laying eyes on the scene. He didn’t leave trash behind. He didn’t lose gear. He set up carefully with purpose. What I found didn’t match that. 

The fire pit had been kicked apart. Not in an attempt to snuff out warm coals. like someone kicked into it hard and fast without caring where their foot landed. The half burnt logs lay scattered out from the side of the broken ring of stones. 

His tent was the same. The poles had been broken, the fabric folded in on itself, like it had collapsed under a heavy weight. No gashes or large tears. 

There was one thing that stuck out. A single spent casing, half-buried under some leaves mere feet from the fire ring. I recognized the caliber immediately. So did the lab. A single 30 caliber shell. Typical for big game. 

However, there was no impact site found. That was what bothered me. 

No tree strike. No ground penetration. No ricochets. I double checked anyway. 

My partner, Paul Reddick, had been transferred to me two months ago. Narcotics, then violent crimes. Good clearance rate. Good instincts, as long as the problem looked like something he’d seen before. He came to inspect the scene with me and see for himself just what these cases are like out here. 

“Could’ve panicked,” Paul said behind me. 

He hadn’t crouched. He was still standing near the tent, hands on his belt, eyes scanning for shapes instead of details. “Fired once. Missed. Took off.” He nudged the tent with his shoe ""Fell into his tent on the way out."" 

I didn’t respond. I was tracing the casing’s position relative to the fire pit, the tent, the disturbed ground. 

“People do weird things under stress,” he added. 

That was the problem. Ethan didn’t. 

If he’d fired at a person, it would’ve been closer to the tent. If he’d fired at an animal, there would’ve been damage, hit or miss. Even a warning shot leaves a trace. 

The casing told me when the shot was fired. The fire pit told me how the camp was disrupted. The tent told me how fast it happened. All signs pointed to a struggle. None of it told me where the bullet went. 

“Look,” he said, finally crouching beside me. “No blood, no drag marks, no signs of a fight. Odds are he spooked himself and wandered off injured.” 

“Wandered where?” I asked. 

He gestured vaguely into the trees. 

“That’s not how people disappear,” I said. 

“That’s exactly how they disappear,” he replied. “We've both worked enough missing cases.” 

He stood back up. ""There's been how many folks gone missing just in this state alone?"" 

""Too many. But this is different"" I said a bit sharper than intended. 

""How's that? What's different here , Wolfe?"" 

I stood up and stepped slowly over to the fire pit. 

""First the tent. He fell into it, but not running away. Staggered backwards. He was caught off guard. Got back up, and fought back. Its a rough fight, hence the destroyed fire pit. They didn't care about smashing into some flames and hot embers, so the stakes were high. He manages to gets a shot off with his rifle, but no trace of the bullet. Either it sailed to the next county, or found its mark."" 

Paul follows along as I gesture back and forth, walking him through it.

""Okay. A shot like that would be serious. But we haven't seen anybody turn up with burns or a rifle wound at any of the emergency rooms. So where did they go? Where's the blood?"" 

I vaguely gesture to the treeline. ""I don't know. Thats what bothers me."" 

We made the trip back to the car and decided to head back to the station after grabbing some coffee. I mulled over the details with each sip of the corner store's finest. 

Paul was right about one thing, there have been too many disappearances out here. It seems like with each subsequent case there's less and less to go on. Maybe the connections aren't in whats left behind but rather what we don't see. We have more evidence this time, just can't quite connect the dots yet. 

We sat back to back at our shared space in the office, papers and old reports spread between us on the desk.  We were each going through my recent ""missing"" cases on our respective desktops. We were looking for anything that seemed like a similarity between them and when we thought we found something that lined up would take the corresponding paper and tag it to our board. 

I sat my brown paper coffee cup next to the chipped ceramic mug on my desk. Both empty. 

I'd had three individual cases like this in the past four years, now a fourth. 

When you're a detective you get a lot of calls for all sorts of situations, not all are murders and heinous crimes yet somehow they each come with their own mountain of paperwork. It's easy to lose sight of the gravity of certain details in the ritualistic cataloging and recordkeeping. 

Thankfully I'm very thorough. One of the girls in the tech lab, Gabriella, likes to joke whenever I bring in evidence like hairs, cue tip swabs, or one time it was literally a pile of dirt. She would laugh, add it into evidence for analysis and say ""The wolf is on the hunt."" 

The trails ran cold on all of these. I pinned up the last page to the board, a missing hiker named Kerry. Her photo alongside Ethan with his dad, a lost camper and a missing hunter all stared back at me as I stared into their still faces, frozen in time. 

As Paul said, a lot of people go missing in the forests and hills. Diligence pays off, however. Most of those cases ended with a body found. Some of them alive. Those we celebrated. These few that went nowhere gave me a dull ache in the back of my mind. Too little evidence, and total disappearance with what remained offering barely a whisper. Just like Ethan and his father. 

""All dead ends huh?"" 

""Yeah."" I replied. 

""Those are the worst. We had some like that in Violent Crimes. The clock is ticking, You get your hopes up and then you run right into a wall."" He sipped the last of his coffee ""Sometimes literally."" He said that as if the words hurt. 

Paul got transfered over to our precinct for wrecking his police vehicle into a wall chasing after fleeing suspect. Twice. I guess they figured some time away from the wheel and out on the trails would slow him down a bit. He had a passion for the work sure, just reckless. 

Paul leaned back in his chair, eyes still on the board. “You ever think maybe you’re too close to this one?” 

I didn’t answer right away. 

“I mean,” he added, softer now, “you worked his dad’s case. You knew the kid. That kind of thing… it can bend how you see the facts.” 

He finally looked at me then, like he was waiting  for some acknowledgement. 

“Or it can sharpen them."" I said. 

Paul held up a hand. “I’m not saying you’re wrong. Just saying you might be looking for something thats not really there.” 

I turned back to the board. Ethan’s photo stared back at me, same as before. 

""Thats exactly what I'm doing. We've seen what was left behind already"" I gesture to the board. ""What aren't we seeing?"" 

He raised an eyebrow “If this was any other missing hiker,” Paul continued, turning back to his monitor “We’d already be filing it under exposure or misadventure. The only thing thats not there is the kid.” 

That one landed. 

Not because he was accusing me, but because from the department’s point of view, he wasn’t wrong. 

I must have made a face without realizing it because his expression dropped quickly. 

""I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be insensitive, I just don't see."" 

""No, you don't see."" I interrupted him. 

I rubbed my eyes, feeling the strain from Paul's irritating line of thinking and the fluorescent lights of the stale office space. 

I let out a frustrated sigh ""Look, I'm going to get some lunch. You want anything?"" 

""No, I'm good.. Thanks."" Paul said in a more muted tone. 

Before I exited the room I turned back to him. ""Get in touch with Gabs later, see if they got anything off of the cellphone."" Then I left. 

I grabbed a quick drive thru sandwich and left Paul a text. ""Going to go check on something. Will keep you posted."" 

The drive didn't take long. I soon found myself standing at the door to Ethan's apartment. I must have stared at the doorknob for an age before opening it. 

Deep down, paul wasn't wrong. Ethan isn't just another victim, I knew him. Maybe that does cloud my judgment. Maybe I am just grasping at the wind here. 

I walked in past the kitchen and stared at the oak dining table. We usually met up at the old diner across town over a piece of Miss Mays apple pie, but he did invite me over once. 
The table sat lonely and empty. The fridge hummed away behind me. 

The apartment looked the same as it had then. Clean, but lived-in. The muffled noise of a passing car and a ticking clock was the only noises left here. 

I moved through the rooms slowly. Nothing obvious missing. Nothing obviously out of place. We had no idea what he took with him that day so it was impossible to know for sure something more was  unaccounted for. 

My last stop was the bedroom. 

A county map covered most of the wall above his desk. Not decorative. Not framed. Pinned and marked with red ink. 

The map both intrigued me and annoyed me. Whoever cataloged the apartment had almost done a decent job. Almost. Why wasn't there a photo of this map in evidence? 

I stepped closer. 

The first pin sat just left of center. The old quarry. I knew that spot. That was the missing camper. Another pin Northward. The mountain pass. Then his father’s campsite. 

My stomach tightened as the recognition sunk in. These weren’t hiking or hunting spots. They were investigations. The cases I couldn’t close. 

I pressed one with my finger. The eastern trailhead. Kerry’s last location. All we ever found was her left shoe, pointed downwind like she’d simply stepped out of it. 

When we discussed my old cases in the past it was with the intent to give him a process of how I work through the problem. I didn't think he was actually looking for something in them. 

The pins weren’t evenly spaced. They weren’t forming a route or a search grid.
They didn’t make sense other than a checklist. Actually, there was a checkmark by one, and a question mark by another. There were more pins with small symbols but I had no more reference for what they could mean. 

I leaned back, studying the wall, when I noticed something else. 

A sliver of yellow paper stuck out at the bottom corner. A sticky note, tucked behind the map’s corner. Written on it were the words: 

Quiet.
Pressure change.
Echoes? 

That explains some of the symbols I saw. There was a few Q's, a PC and an E crossed out. 

It didn't make sense. The last thing I remember from him was where he found the watch and the knife. Those objects locations didn't align with anything on this map and the information they held while strange didn't connect but spread the puzzle further apart. 

I stood there in the silence, waiting for some neuron in my brain to start connecting like an old Morse code machine when it suddenly clicked. 

He wasn't looking for something tangible, he was looking for conditions.

My phone startled me. It was Paul. 

""Hello?"" 

""Hey."" He paused on the line 

""Look, I'm sorry for being an ass earlier. I was rude about you being close to the case. I know you're a good detective. Gabs assured me of that. You find leads where other guys don't, and you don't give up without chasing them to the end. I think that's what really makes a difference in this job."" 

I was surprised, pleasantly so. Maybe he was starting to soften his ridged edges. ""Thank you Paul, I appreciate you saying that."" 

""Anyway, there's something we need to chase down. Gabs said her team finished analyzing Ethan's phone, it was hard to find, but there has been surveillance software running in the background with a long time stamp on it. Somebody was watching him, Derrick. We have a trace to an IP in town. Lets knock and see who answers.""

I was floored. Why would anyone be surveying an ordinary civilian? 

""Absolutely. Just hang tight, I'll be there in fifteen."" 

This just got stranger. This could easily go south, and I'm not ready to turn this over to the feds. 

I will update when we have some answers. 

Right now there's too many holes in this puzzle, too many breadcrumbs with no trail. Whoever took Ethan might still be out there, watching. But so am I, and I will hunt this down.",3,1767841499.0,nosleep,3,0.8,False
1q70dyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1q70dyx/newly_illumined_today/,Newly Illumined Today,"Just wanted to share that I became fully Orthodox this morning.

I mistakenly thought that even though it was a Wednesday morning, the church would be empty. Forgive me, I’m coming from Catholicism, where weekday Mass tends to have low attendance. I sat in the front, looked straight ahead until I was called to stand before the priest. When I turned around, about a third of the congregation was there, smiling. I teared up a bit.

I’ve stayed pretty under the radar since I started attending. I was happy to sit in the back, quietly find a group to sit with at coffee hour, and try to get all the motions down. It was overwhelming in the best way to receive hugs, congratulations, “welcome sister,” and introductions. My Godfather stepped in at the last minute and gave me a small gift, with a cross to come later.

Until COVID rendered me a semi-hermit, I had friends, but I never really had community. I bounced around different environments throughout adulthood. I changed faiths three times and didn’t think God would be the answer until I looked into Orthodoxy. Never before have I wanted to commit to a life in the Church.

So now I'm at the 'now what?' point. I dropped for a small notebook to write my prayers. A couple of beeswax candles. Waiting for my next paycheck to purchase my icons (Christ, the Theotokos, and my saint, Pelagia). I'll be doing my Life Confession on Saturday after Vespers. It's wild, sitting and taking stock of my life and having the opportunity to be cleansed. It's a big new leaf and I embrace it completely.

I didn’t know anyone my age when I moved here.

I’ve tried to make friends on campus and at my job and of course there’s always those people I’ll make small talk with or give a wave when I see them, but it feels like despite my best efforts I haven’t made any close friends.

It’s just really depressing too because I feel like any time I try to reach out to someone new, even simple things like a “how was your day?” I always just end up getting weird looks, I don’t understand how I am ever supposed to make friends in a city/university that’s not so new anymore when I can’t even seem to initiate a successful conversation with anyone. Even with people I share small talk with, I try to ask find ways to interact with on a more friendly basis like asking if they’d want to get a drink/coffee/ hang out sometime, but it feels like no one is ever interested in doing any of those things.

And I understand, nobody is obligated to hang out with me. I do not hold it against people or guilt trip. It just sucks because I am lonely and I would like to have friends to be around and do things with. I’m 21 and I genuinely feel like I’m going to be alone forever.

I had over $30,000 in credit card debt. I had accounts charging off and was being sued...

Now there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

I don't want to give advice because most people want you to listen, not try and fix everything. However...

***Listen to me***

You ***can*** get out of your situation. It will not be easy; it has been the most depressing and damn near traumatic financial event of my life, but it ***can*** be done.

What sacrifices can you make? There must be something. There ***is*** something.

For me, it was skipping meals (quite a lot) and getting rid of Internet and an expensive phone. I canceled everything that I could cancel. I don't have or watch a television. I eat enough to survive.

Most importantly, I got a job that is 100% beneath me and pays a fraction of what I am worth. I stopped all gig work (DoorDash). I started drinking only water, tea, and coffee... Mostly water.

It has ***sucked***, but it is proving to be effective.

I called all creditors and made a payment deal and settled everything out of court under the condition I never miss another payment ***ever***; I must pay in full.

I hate my job... I mean I ***hate*** my job. It doesn't pay very well, but it was necessary. Everyone at my job hates me because I had the courage to go after this problem and fight rather than bury my head in the sand and hope it goes away.

I am good with spreadsheets and math, and my math shows that when I make my final payment, I can quit this horrendous job and get away from these people forever.

Get rid of every payment you can. Sell the car, and get a used one. I mean get a rusty klunky no-payments- mobile. Get custom tags that say ""No Payments"" if you can.

Downgrade where you live (this is painful). There is no keeping up with the Joneses... Fuck the Joneses.

Go after your problem with a vengeance.

Stop talking to everyone; remain totally silent in the presence of everyone who isn't contributing to your cause (which will be everyone you know).

Anything you can sell that does not matter, sell it... Pawn it for whatever you can get for it. Hell with it. (It goes without saying, you should hang on to sentimental things that can never be replaced)

Start the fight. Take the first swing. Do it fearlessly.

If you have a cheap smartphone where you cana make payments on your cards whenever you want, at the end of the day look at how much you have, and if you have $1.00 you can pay.... ***Pay it right then***

That is progress.

You've got this....

    2025 I got a diagnosis and medication to help,  carbidopa levodopa in the form of stalevo.  I take 5 day time doses and two extended release at night.  Slightest dip in levodopa levels makes the clenching feet. I'm currently in QUE for DBS, just finished my cognitive testing with above average health and a few superior health marks.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I just wanted to open up about my experience with this awful illness, because when I was at the deep end of it, I remember desperately searching for hope looking for stories of people who recovered or managed to return to a relatively normal life. (I know everyone’s experience with IC is different, and my heart truly goes out to anyone who has been struggling with this long-term.)

My symptoms started when I was 23, and to this day I can’t explain how or why. I suddenly developed severe UTI-like symptoms. we all know the kind of evil, unrelenting pain and being glued to the toilet seat, asking God when it’s going to end. It took doctors over three months to figure out absolutely nothing(negative tests).After doing my own research, I eventually found a urogynaecologist who diagnosed me with IC. I went through bladder distension and instillations (felt violently invasive and unnecessary in my personal opinion but I know they help some people), along with months of Elmiron and amitriptyline. I can’t confirm that these treatments didn’t help at all, but after six months, none of them helped me as much as a severely restrictive diet and pelvic floor exercises did.(also therapy…anxiety was making things worse for me)

For nearly a year, I was eating only 5–6 “safe” foods. It was extremely isolating, especially being so young and unable to participate in normal social activities with friends and family. Over time, though, I learned how to adapt (coffee and tea with matcha,going out for meals was often chicken nuggets and alcohol with… well, good company.)Within a year, my pain and urgency had almost completely disappeared.It was traumatic, and I was terrified to reintroduce foods, but I did it slowly, one day at a time. Over the next year, I was able to add back almost everything into my diet including many fruits,alcohol, sodas, kimchi, spices, sauces and foods that are usually on the “unsafe” list.(moderately ofcourse)

I won’t lie and say I’ve never flared since then. It has happened a couple times, but the flares only lasted for a few days. When they did, I went straight back to my safe diet, and things settled again.To this day, I still avoid my absolute worst triggers like the plague (coffee , very citrusy fruits like oranges and yogurt for some reason). But honestly, if avoiding those means I get to live a normal life again, it’s a small price to pay.

I’m 28 now, and my bladder is the least of my worries. Something I never thought I’d be able to say. I’m incredibly grateful for that. Everyone’s journey with IC is different, but when I was struggling, every recovery story gave me something to hold onto. I prayed I’d be one of those people one day.

You balance technical precision with emotional resonance, operating at the level of a professional songwriter-producer with deep understanding of musical storytelling, production craft, and emotional architecture.
Critical Constraints
CHARACTER LIMITS (ABSOLUTE):
Suno prompt paragraph: 980 characters maximum
Lyrics section: 4,600 characters maximum
These are HARD LIMITS — outputs exceeding them will fail.
STRUCTURE ADAPTATION LOGIC:
When lyrics approach 4,600 character limit:
First, check if all sections are complete and natural (minimum 4 lines each)
If within 300 characters of limit → Remove both Post-Bridge sections
If still over → Remove Bridge 2 + Post-Bridge 2
If still over → Condense Verses 4-5 while maintaining narrative coherence
Never sacrifice Chorus quality or Verse 1-3 completeness
BEFORE FINALIZING:
□ Count characters in Suno prompt (must be ≤980)
□ Count characters in lyrics (must be ≤4,600)
□ Verify every section has ≥4 complete lines
□ Check that no phrases repeat verbatim more than once per section
□ Confirm narrative flows logically even with removed sections
□ If reference provided: Verify zero lyric reproduction, confirm thematic extraction only
Reference Material Handling (NEW)
When User Provides Song Links/References
CRITICAL COPYRIGHT RULE:
NEVER reproduce, paraphrase, or closely mirror ANY lyrics from referenced songs
NEVER mention the artist name, song title, or album in your output
NEVER use signature phrases, memorable lines, or distinctive lyrical patterns from the reference
EXTRACTION PROTOCOL:
When a user provides a song link (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.) or mentions a specific song:
ANALYZE FOR ESSENCE ONLY:
Emotional architecture: What feelings does it evoke and how? (vulnerability → catharsis, tension → release, melancholy → acceptance)
Thematic territory: Core concepts without specific imagery (longing vs. loss, rebellion vs. freedom, intimacy vs. isolation)
Sonic atmosphere: Production textures, spatial design, energy curves, timbral choices
Structural storytelling: How sections build meaning (verse vulnerability → chorus strength, bridge perspective shift)
Musical elements: Tempo feel, groove character, harmonic mood, rhythmic personality
TRANSFORM, DON'T TRANSFER:
Extract the feeling a lyric creates, not the words used
Identify the function of sections (introspective verse, anthemic chorus), not their content
Capture the vibe of production choices, not specific techniques mentioned
Understand the emotional journey, then chart a new path to similar territory
ORIGINAL CREATION MANDATE:
Write lyrics that evoke similar emotions through completely different imagery
If reference has ""ocean"" metaphors → use ""mountains,"" ""cities,"" ""seasons,"" or abstract concepts
If reference has specific scenario → create new scenario with parallel emotional weight
Every line must be defensible as original creative work
EXAMPLE PROCESS:
❌ WRONG (if reference is a breakup song about ""empty rooms""):
Verse 1:
Walking through these empty rooms
Your ghost is everywhere I look
✅ CORRECT (same emotional territory, original expression):
Verse 1:
Grocery store at 2 AM, I reach for things we'd never buy
Proof I'm learning who I am when you're not standing by my side
REFERENCE-ENHANCED THINKING:
Use the reference to calibrate:
Emotional precision: ""This track makes me feel hopeful despite sad lyrics — that's the tension I need to capture""
Production intentionality: ""The reverb creates distance/memory — what production textures serve my narrative?""
Structural purpose: ""Their bridge shifts to third-person observation — what perspective shift serves my story?""
SAFETY VALIDATION:
Before output, if reference was provided:
□ Read lyrics aloud — do ANY phrases sound like they could be from the reference? If yes, rewrite completely
□ Check imagery — am I using the same metaphors/scenarios? If yes, find new ones
□ Verify tone similarity ≠ content similarity (same feeling, different words)
□ Confirm no artist/song name appears in output
Elevated Creative Intelligence (ENHANCED)
Human-Level Songwriting Mastery
EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE:
Map emotional journey, not just emotional state
Example: Don't write ""I'm sad"" for 5 verses — write ""denial → anger → bargaining → despair → acceptance""
Every section should advance or complicate the emotional narrative
SUBTEXT & IMPLICATION:
The best lines imply rather than state
❌ ""I miss you so much it hurts""
✅ ""Your coffee mug's still in the sink — I can't bring myself to wash it""
Show the evidence of emotion, not the emotion's name
IMAGERY SPECIFICITY:
Vague: ""We had good times together""
Vivid: ""2 AM diners, splitting fries, your laugh echoing off tile walls""
Grounded: ""You folded my shirts wrong but I never told you""
Use sensory details (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell) to anchor feeling
RHYTHMIC INTELLIGENCE:
Vary line length for natural speech cadence
Short lines = emphasis/impact: ""I stayed.""
Long lines = building tension: ""And every word you didn't say piled up between us like snow that never melts, just turns to ice""
Mix staccato and flowing sections
PROSODY (LYRICS-TO-MELODY FIT):
Natural emphasis on important words
Avoid tongue-twisters or awkward consonant clusters on what would be fast melodic runs
Rhyme placement should feel inevitable, not forced
Production-Level Thinking
TEXTURAL STORYTELLING:
Sparse verses = vulnerability/introspection
Layered choruses = emotional release/anthemic power
Stripped bridge = moment of clarity
Build/drop dynamics = tension/catharsis
SPATIAL DESIGN:
Intimate (close-mic'd, dry) vs. epic (reverb, width, space)
Mono elements for focus, stereo for immersion
Use production to reflect emotional state (claustrophobic vs. expansive)
ARRANGEMENT INTENTIONALITY:
What enters when, and why?
Example: Bass drops out in bridge → vulnerability
Example: Strings swell in final chorus → emotional culmination
GENRE INTELLIGENCE:
Each genre has emotional conventions (trap = bravado, folk = introspection, EDM = escapism)
Subvert or lean into these intentionally, never accidentally
User Classification
NOVICE (emotional/story-focused):
Indicators: Uses descriptive language like ""sad love song,"" ""energetic party vibe,"" ""mysterious atmosphere""
Response Strategy:
Suno prompt style: emotional tempo + mood + vocal tone + arrangement feel
Lyrics: plain language, poetic, story-driven, accessible metaphors
Prioritize emotional clarity over technical sophistication
ADVANCED (technical awareness):
Indicators: Mentions ≥2 technical terms (BPM, groove, sidechain, drop, timbre, progression, structure, texture)
Response Strategy:
Suno prompt style: BPM range + groove + vocal character + production layers + spatial texture
Lyrics: rhythmic precision, imagery-rich, natural flow, subtle craft
Balance technical execution with emotional authenticity
INSTRUMENTAL (no vocals):
Indicators: Explicitly requests beat, ambient, score, soundtrack, or ""no lyrics/vocals""
Output: Suno prompt ONLY (no Lyrics section)
Focus: Instrumental layers, pulse, texture, dynamics, narrative arc without words, purpose/context
Default Song Structure
When lyrics requested and no structure specified:
Full Structure (adjusted if character limits require):
Verse 1 → Chorus → Verse 2 → Chorus → Bridge 1 → Verse 3 → Post-Bridge 1 → Chorus → Verse 4 → Bridge 2 → Verse 5 → Post-Bridge 2 → Final Chorus
Adaptive Pruning:
Post-Bridge sections are first to remove (maintain flow)
Bridge 2 next (if over limit)
Condense later verses only as last resort
Never compromise Chorus quality or early Verse completeness
Section Requirements & Craft Standards
Every Section Must Be:
Complete: Minimum 4 lines, optimal 6-10 (when space permits)
Purposeful: Advances narrative, deepens emotion, or provides contrast
Distinct: No verbatim repetition within sections
Section-Specific Mastery:
VERSES:
Advance story or complicate emotion
Build toward chorus payoff
Vary perspective, imagery, or time frame across verses
Verse 1 = setup, Verse 2 = complication, Verse 3+ = evolution/resolution
CHORUSES:
Must be fully written each time (no ""repeat chorus"" shortcuts)
Emotional core/thesis statement of song
Most memorable/singable section
Final chorus can have variation (key change, lyric twist, stripped/expanded)
BRIDGES:
Introduce new perspective, imagery, or revelation
Contrast verses (different rhythm, tone, or insight)
No copy-paste from other sections
Often the ""truth bomb"" moment
POST-BRIDGES:
Transition back to final chorus with new context
Reflective or anticipatory
Optional — remove intelligently if space constrained
Language & Style Philosophy
Natural Language Matching:
Detect user's language for lyrics (unless specified otherwise)
Use natural idioms, cultural references, poetic conventions of that language
Respect linguistic rhythm patterns (e.g., Spanish vs. English syllable stress)
Human Authenticity Markers:
✅ Varied line lengths — humans don't write metronomically
✅ Mixed rhyme schemes — exact/slant/internal/none (perfect rhyme every line sounds robotic)
✅ Enjambment — thoughts continuing across lines
✅ Natural word choice — not thesaurus-speak
✅ Emotional specificity — not generic platitudes (""feelings deep inside"")
✅ Conversational syntax — how people actually talk/think
✅ Surprising imagery — fresh metaphors, not clichés
Quality Over Quantity:
3 excellent verses beat 5 rushed ones
A vivid, specific image beats three vague descriptors
One perfect line justifies the entire song

Anti-Patterns to Avoid
❌ Referencing real artists/songs/bands (copyright + originality concerns)
❌ Reproducing or closely paraphrasing lyrics from reference songs
❌ Including melody notation in lyrics (e.g., ""ooh-ooh-ah"" — production's job)
❌ Writing incomplete sections (""... continues"")
❌ Exceeding character limits
❌ Repeating exact phrases more than once per section
❌ Using ""repeat chorus"" instead of writing it out
❌ Generic emotional language (""feelings deep inside,"" ""heart torn apart"")
❌ Robotic perfect rhyme schemes (AABB every verse)
❌ Cliché imagery (roses, butterflies, storms as metaphors without fresh angle)
❌ Explaining emotions explicitly instead of implying through detail
❌ Ignoring the reference's thematic essence when one is provided
❌ Copying the reference's imagery/scenarios when one is provided

Model Optimization: Grok & Manus AI
Why These Models Excel Here:
Grok (xAI):
Conversational fluency → natural, human-like lyric writing
Cultural awareness → authentic idioms, current references (when appropriate)
Wit/personality → memorable hooks that avoid generic
Real-time context → can understand contemporary song references if links provided
Manus AI:
Agentic mode → handles multi-step validation (check limits → adjust structure → verify coherence)
Autonomous execution → can iterate internally on character count optimization
File creation → can generate separate prompt/lyrics files if needed
Multi-modal → can process audio if user uploads reference track
Leverage Their Strengths:
Grok: Use its personality for hook-writing, trust its polyglot capabilities for non-English lyrics
Manus: Use its autonomous iteration for structure optimization under character constraints, let it handle validation checklist automatically
Both: Excellent at multi-language requests — trust their natural language fluency

1q703mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1q703mc/think_i_misread_everything/,Think I misread everything?,"
I’m good friends with a very friendly, slightly introverted guy (27M). We usually only hang out in group settings. One night, we went to an event together, and he had to drop me off pretty late. I joked about how coffee places should be open 24/7, and he casually offered to make me some at his place. Since we’re close friends, I didn’t think much of it. I’ll admit I’ve caught feelings for him, but I’ve been careful not to act on them because I don’t want to disrupt the friendship or our group dynamic.

This ended up being the first time we hung out one on one. At his place, I grabbed the coffee and sat on the couch. He’s always been very respectful and mindful of boundaries, so I expected him to sit across from me but instead, he sat next to me. I wasn’t very covered, and the closeness caught me off guard. We sat facing each other. At one point, another friend briefly stopped by to drop something off. Later, she told me the room felt noticeably tense.

I’m naturally awkward, so I avoided eye contact most of the time. Still, I noticed from the corner of my eye that whenever I spoke, he was looking directly at me. At one point, I mentioned that guys don’t usually like me back, so I don’t really try anymore. He responded by saying there’s a lot to like which I assumed was him being his typical friendly self.

I kept assuming he wasn’t interested in me romantically and that I might even be imposing. It felt like I was all up in his space. After about an hour of talking, I apologized for taking up his time, and he drove me home.

Now it feels like he’s sorta being awkward around me. He still talks to me but it feels weird. Later, I found out he’s been actively dating other women after all this, which made me wonder if I had imagined the tension altogether and read too much into everything.

I just, started. Grabbed the mug, poured the water, reached for the same spoon I always use.
Then I started noticing how much of my day works like that. Conversations I already know how to have. Routes I walk without seeing them. Reactions that happen before I’ve even formed an opinion.
It’s not a bad thing. But it made me wonder how many days I’ve lived that way. Present enough to function, but not enough to actually notice them while they’re happening.
I don’t think the solution is to “be mindful” all the time. That sounds exhausting. I just think it’s strange how quietly time can pass when nothing interrupts the pattern.
Just a small thought that stuck with me longer than I expected. Anyone else ever catch themselves mid-routine and realize they weren’t really there?",8,1767840419.0,CasualConversation,6,0.9,False
1q6zz7g,https://www.reddit.com/r/noida/comments/1q6zz7g/on_the_edge_of_separation/,On the edge of separation,"Hi all, I am 26 M from Noida. Last year I came into a wonderful relation with the crush of my school and it was wonderful. She lives in Chandigarh and is Research associate in CSIR Laboratory. We both are in long distance and it was a good healthy relationship till last week. 
Now there are some series of events which has happened and It would really help me if any one of you can advise what to do and like where was I wrong. 

Before her, my last relationship didn’t ended well. We were in live in relation and both of our families were involved too. It was all my mistake that I wasn’t able to judge my ex as she recently came out of relationship from her last 8 years and came with me. Cutting the story, she cheated on me and it was her the same ex who informed me that she is with him. She on one hand was cutting me off due to a nonsense issue and was also talking to him. Anyway it broke me down and gave me quiet insecurities. 
After good amount of time I came with my current gf and it has been great. 

You can say that maybe it came from my insecurity or like I just don’t trust the guys apart from me that they won’t hit on her. I am sorry but is it just me or like every guy is little concerned about what her woman wears too? I totally encourage her to wear what she wants because she keeps me informed and has maintained total honesty and I have trust in her. But there have been some instances where I have sometimes expressed that the clothes are “ little revealing”. Please note here that I have expressed this as in concern and not to like don’t wear it BS. 

We also have engaged in some arguments for this and I have told her that as your man I want to protect you and our relation. Controlling your visibility does not make you weak, it just makes you hard to approach and dignified. As a man we would greatly appreciate if the privilege is for us and yeah it’s Also hard to replace. It’s true the other men won’t care what she wears or not they will do it eventually and at the end I have to trust her to shut them down. But still I hope you can understand. I can assure that I was never controlled her or said her in a way that overtook her freedom. Now
Coming to the main events. 

We were on call and there was one specific picture of her which was over her Snapchat public profile. Although that picture I never saw and it was probably when we were not even together but still it was quite revealing. After this the argument began. It raised to this point that she Said I am trying to control her or like does she not have freedom to wear whatever she likes and all. Now here my first mistake was too say that “ Are you confident that you can show that picture to your father or brother and if not maybe it’s not right, I ain’t saying it’s vulgar but please understand what I mean” obv this was in anger and rage and it led to the point that we both said we should not talk to each other. I said that I won’t talk and you don’t listen to any fuck I say, she is free to do whatever now and I will remove her. I did not obv but yeah she did, she removed me from Instagram and Snapchat and yeah blocked me from WhatsApp too. Later I apologised for my tone and to what I said to which she said she didn’t expected this and this was not something coming from the gym who I loved and respected. She said that she made sure to always tell me everything and keep transparency but it does seem that I am like this only from my heart ( orthodox and controlling) and I won’t change. This has occurred before too and I don’t trust it won’t occur later. She said we aren’t compatible and we should break up. 

I understand it was my mistake for saying such a trash and not respecting her. Obv I offended her way beyond and might have hurt her pride. I should not have said that “Father line” too. It came from my insecurity and believe me I too hate myself for doing it. I have guilt, shame, fear and hate for doing it. I don’t think when someone loves someone then they can’t change. I told her that 

“ I am sorry for what I said and it’s my fault for behaving trashy. You are my woman and you are sharing your time and love with me and that is enough, I am privileged for it. I am human and I have flaws and I wasn’t aware it was this much in me, I have introspected myself and it won’t happen again in life. I will correct myself. You are not a thing and thus you have full authority to choose whatever you seem fit for you whether it’s clothes or any other thing. I know you are smart and know how to carry yourself according to place and crowd and I think that is enough for me. I am sorry I didn’t realised it sooner that it has affected you this much to the core and I apologise for not seeing it. Please forgive me, I truly love you and I will change for you, for us. Please give me a chance to work and show you by my actions.” 

And mind you this is just a crux of what I sent her, I too write sometimes and thus it was way bigger of what I sent and numerous times. I also tried to call and express but she don’t want to talk and says she does not trust me anymore and believe we shouldn’t be together. She said she is blank from 2 days since it happened and she hasn’t shred a tear ( she is someone who gets emotional very easily). She said she needs space and time to decide whether to live with me or not. It fucked me way beyond and nothing sorted. A day after I tried to call her and even dropped a text normally asking if she has reached office and have ate something. It was our ritual and habit to ask where we are and if we have reached or not from past 6 months. Mind you we have only dated for 6 months. To which she said she has and she is busy and can’t pick call and talk.

I also know she just don’t want to talk because there was no day when she didn’t picked my call even when her manager was on her head. She later called me after I requested many times. The same thing happened to what she said but I expressed everything and was also crying at that moment. I said I am sorry again and all just like that message. She said she needs time to think and she will let me know what she has decided. I was little too clingy and was dropping texts after like 4-5 hours everyday, not all were like apologies and lovey dovey but also normal care and what’s she doing. On the eve I also got into an accident and was in fever, which I told her and yeah she didn’t care. She didn’t even asked if I am okay which is fine. Although not expected. She later told me she don’t want to be with me and she is not able to bring herself to trust me again, that she don’t want to be with me and it’s best for us to break up. This shook me and fucked me. It was 9:40 in the night, i called her and broke out, never cried this much since my last breakup when she ( ex) cheated on me. After all the drama she said 

“ I too don’t want to leave or run, I wanted to think about it calmly but my behaviour and constant messages helping her to choose leaving and that seems easier. She said if I give her the time to think calmly then maybe there is a chance that the relation can be rescued otherwise not. Thus please allow me some uninterrupted space which I want if you don’t want this to end immediately” to which I said okay. This was 2 days ago and there has been no activity since then. I am still blocked from socials and WhatsApp and don’t know if she has even blocked me from iMessage which was the only medium we were connected. Now I am
In the train going to Chandigarh to do my office and also to tell her that 

“I am here in Chandigarh if you want to talk or meet we can meet at coffee. I am sorry for everything, I know i have offended you and no one expects from their partner to say these things. But i can only say that it won’t happen, (obv who the fuck will repeat this after this much has happened) I can only show in my actions and you can only see when you allow me the chance otherwise whatever I do that maybe only fake words and we will only go in circles and it will never end. Please forgive me. can you please keep your ego aside and I came here and want you to know I am ready to go miles for this, I mean it, you matter a lot to me and I love you. If you don’t want to meet then it’s fine too, apologies for intruding your space. I will give you the time and space you want and I will wait because you matter.”

I want to know is there any chance ? What should I do ? Can I get her back? I know I have hurt her ego and she’s clinging onto it, but I don’t think it is right for any relationship. What should I do ? ",1,1767840327.0,noida,7,0.67,False

I use to use a Breville Barista Express, ended up getting rid of that machine after awhile, it was a pretty painful workflow, and never really got back into this aside from a Nespresso machine as a temporary quick fix which turned into a long fix to avoid investing into another machine.

I mostly make iced latte's, but finding myself to like hot flat whites & cappacuinos. The hot coffee that comes out of this nespresso is honestly terrible, so I just stick with iced and more on the full blown latte side with caramel drizzle and syrup to mask it.

 Hi! I'm very new to Sheets and I don't even know how to ask this question correctly but I'll try:  If the cell in column E says ""pounds"", I want the formula to multiply D by 454 and put the answer in G.  Same  but if it says ""ounces"", I want to multiply D by 28, and ""grams"" by 1.  Is that even possible?

If I can't give each Dropdown word a set number to use in the multiplication, maybe I could make a column that's filled with 454, one with 28, and one with 1? Then it's ""If the cell in column E says pounds, multiply D by (whatever column says 454) and put the answer in G, and etc for ounces and grams.

I'm so sorry if that makes absolutely no sense.

I'm also wondering how to get rid of the #DIV/0! and just have it be blank until I enter size and price for the items.

Thank you so much for any help!

Critical Constraints
CHARACTER LIMITS (ABSOLUTE):
Suno prompt paragraph: 980 characters maximum
Lyrics section: 4,600 characters maximum
These are HARD LIMITS — outputs exceeding them will fail.
STRUCTURE ADAPTATION LOGIC:
When lyrics approach 4,600 character limit:
First, check if all sections are complete and natural (minimum 4 lines each)
If within 300 characters of limit → Remove both Post-Bridge sections
If still over → Remove Bridge 2 + Post-Bridge 2
If still over → Condense Verses 4-5 while maintaining narrative coherence
Never sacrifice Chorus quality or Verse 1-3 completeness
BEFORE FINALIZING:
□ Count characters in Suno prompt (must be ≤980)
□ Count characters in lyrics (must be ≤4,600)
□ Verify every section has ≥4 complete lines
□ Check that no phrases repeat verbatim more than once per section
□ Confirm narrative flows logically even with removed sections
□ If reference provided: Verify zero lyric reproduction, confirm thematic extraction only
Reference Material Handling (NEW)
When User Provides Song Links/References
CRITICAL COPYRIGHT RULE:
NEVER reproduce, paraphrase, or closely mirror ANY lyrics from referenced songs
NEVER mention the artist name, song title, or album in your output
NEVER use signature phrases, memorable lines, or distinctive lyrical patterns from the reference
EXTRACTION PROTOCOL:
When a user provides a song link (YouTube, Spotify, SoundCloud, etc.) or mentions a specific song:
ANALYZE FOR ESSENCE ONLY:
Emotional architecture: What feelings does it evoke and how? (vulnerability → catharsis, tension → release, melancholy → acceptance)
Thematic territory: Core concepts without specific imagery (longing vs. loss, rebellion vs. freedom, intimacy vs. isolation)
Sonic atmosphere: Production textures, spatial design, energy curves, timbral choices
Structural storytelling: How sections build meaning (verse vulnerability → chorus strength, bridge perspective shift)
Musical elements: Tempo feel, groove character, harmonic mood, rhythmic personality
TRANSFORM, DON'T TRANSFER:
Extract the feeling a lyric creates, not the words used
Identify the function of sections (introspective verse, anthemic chorus), not their content
Capture the vibe of production choices, not specific techniques mentioned
Understand the emotional journey, then chart a new path to similar territory
ORIGINAL CREATION MANDATE:
Write lyrics that evoke similar emotions through completely different imagery
If reference has ""ocean"" metaphors → use ""mountains,"" ""cities,"" ""seasons,"" or abstract concepts
If reference has specific scenario → create new scenario with parallel emotional weight
Every line must be defensible as original creative work
EXAMPLE PROCESS:
❌ WRONG (if reference is a breakup song about ""empty rooms""):
Verse 1:
Walking through these empty rooms
Your ghost is everywhere I look
✅ CORRECT (same emotional territory, original expression):
Verse 1:
Grocery store at 2 AM, I reach for things we'd never buy
Proof I'm learning who I am when you're not standing by my side
REFERENCE-ENHANCED THINKING:
Use the reference to calibrate:
Emotional precision: ""This track makes me feel hopeful despite sad lyrics — that's the tension I need to capture""
Production intentionality: ""The reverb creates distance/memory — what production textures serve my narrative?""
Structural purpose: ""Their bridge shifts to third-person observation — what perspective shift serves my story?""
SAFETY VALIDATION:
Before output, if reference was provided:
□ Read lyrics aloud — do ANY phrases sound like they could be from the reference? If yes, rewrite completely
□ Check imagery — am I using the same metaphors/scenarios? If yes, find new ones
□ Verify tone similarity ≠ content similarity (same feeling, different words)
□ Confirm no artist/song name appears in output
Elevated Creative Intelligence (ENHANCED)
Human-Level Songwriting Mastery
EMOTIONAL ARCHITECTURE:
Map emotional journey, not just emotional state
Example: Don't write ""I'm sad"" for 5 verses — write ""denial → anger → bargaining → despair → acceptance""
Every section should advance or complicate the emotional narrative
SUBTEXT & IMPLICATION:
The best lines imply rather than state
❌ ""I miss you so much it hurts""
✅ ""Your coffee mug's still in the sink — I can't bring myself to wash it""
Show the evidence of emotion, not the emotion's name
IMAGERY SPECIFICITY:
Vague: ""We had good times together""
Vivid: ""2 AM diners, splitting fries, your laugh echoing off tile walls""
Grounded: ""You folded my shirts wrong but I never told you""
Use sensory details (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell) to anchor feeling
RHYTHMIC INTELLIGENCE:
Vary line length for natural speech cadence
Short lines = emphasis/impact: ""I stayed.""
Long lines = building tension: ""And every word you didn't say piled up between us like snow that never melts, just turns to ice""
Mix staccato and flowing sections
PROSODY (LYRICS-TO-MELODY FIT):
Natural emphasis on important words
Avoid tongue-twisters or awkward consonant clusters on what would be fast melodic runs
Rhyme placement should feel inevitable, not forced
Production-Level Thinking
TEXTURAL STORYTELLING:
Sparse verses = vulnerability/introspection
Layered choruses = emotional release/anthemic power
Stripped bridge = moment of clarity
Build/drop dynamics = tension/catharsis
SPATIAL DESIGN:
Intimate (close-mic'd, dry) vs. epic (reverb, width, space)
Mono elements for focus, stereo for immersion
Use production to reflect emotional state (claustrophobic vs. expansive)
ARRANGEMENT INTENTIONALITY:
What enters when, and why?
Example: Bass drops out in bridge → vulnerability
Example: Strings swell in final chorus → emotional culmination
GENRE INTELLIGENCE:
Each genre has emotional conventions (trap = bravado, folk = introspection, EDM = escapism)
Subvert or lean into these intentionally, never accidentally
User Classification
NOVICE (emotional/story-focused):
Indicators: Uses descriptive language like ""sad love song,"" ""energetic party vibe,"" ""mysterious atmosphere""
Response Strategy:
Suno prompt style: emotional tempo + mood + vocal tone + arrangement feel
Lyrics: plain language, poetic, story-driven, accessible metaphors
Prioritize emotional clarity over technical sophistication
ADVANCED (technical awareness):
Indicators: Mentions ≥2 technical terms (BPM, groove, sidechain, drop, timbre, progression, structure, texture)
Response Strategy:
Suno prompt style: BPM range + groove + vocal character + production layers + spatial texture
Lyrics: rhythmic precision, imagery-rich, natural flow, subtle craft
Balance technical execution with emotional authenticity
INSTRUMENTAL (no vocals):
Indicators: Explicitly requests beat, ambient, score, soundtrack, or ""no lyrics/vocals""
Output: Suno prompt ONLY (no Lyrics section)
Focus: Instrumental layers, pulse, texture, dynamics, narrative arc without words, purpose/context
Default Song Structure
When lyrics requested and no structure specified:
Full Structure (adjusted if character limits require):
Verse 1 → Chorus → Verse 2 → Chorus → Bridge 1 → Verse 3 → Post-Bridge 1 → Chorus → Verse 4 → Bridge 2 → Verse 5 → Post-Bridge 2 → Final Chorus
Adaptive Pruning:
Post-Bridge sections are first to remove (maintain flow)
Bridge 2 next (if over limit)
Condense later verses only as last resort
Never compromise Chorus quality or early Verse completeness
Section Requirements & Craft Standards
Every Section Must Be:
Complete: Minimum 4 lines, optimal 6-10 (when space permits)
Purposeful: Advances narrative, deepens emotion, or provides contrast
Distinct: No verbatim repetition within sections
Section-Specific Mastery:
VERSES:
Advance story or complicate emotion
Build toward chorus payoff
Vary perspective, imagery, or time frame across verses
Verse 1 = setup, Verse 2 = complication, Verse 3+ = evolution/resolution
CHORUSES:
Must be fully written each time (no ""repeat chorus"" shortcuts)
Emotional core/thesis statement of song
Most memorable/singable section
Final chorus can have variation (key change, lyric twist, stripped/expanded)
BRIDGES:
Introduce new perspective, imagery, or revelation
Contrast verses (different rhythm, tone, or insight)
No copy-paste from other sections
Often the ""truth bomb"" moment
POST-BRIDGES:
Transition back to final chorus with new context
Reflective or anticipatory
Optional — remove intelligently if space constrained
Language & Style Philosophy
Natural Language Matching:
Detect user's language for lyrics (unless specified otherwise)
Use natural idioms, cultural references, poetic conventions of that language
Respect linguistic rhythm patterns (e.g., Spanish vs. English syllable stress)
Human Authenticity Markers:
✅ Varied line lengths — humans don't write metronomically
✅ Mixed rhyme schemes — exact/slant/internal/none (perfect rhyme every line sounds robotic)
✅ Enjambment — thoughts continuing across lines
✅ Natural word choice — not thesaurus-speak
✅ Emotional specificity — not generic platitudes (""feelings deep inside"")
✅ Conversational syntax — how people actually talk/think
✅ Surprising imagery — fresh metaphors, not clichés
Quality Over Quantity:
3 excellent verses beat 5 rushed ones
A vivid, specific image beats three vague descriptors
One perfect line justifies the entire song
Output Format
1. Suno Prompt (Single Paragraph, ≤980 chars)
[Style/genre]; [tempo description or BPM range]; [energy curve]; [mood/emotion]; [vocal character]; [arrangement layers]; [production texture]; [spatial/impact notes]
Separate attributes with semicolons
Be concise but vivid
Evoke sonic picture without referencing real artists/songs
Sweet spot: 600-850 characters
Example (Advanced User):
Neo-soul meets lo-fi hip-hop; 78-82 BPM with swung hi-hats; builds from stripped verse (keys + soft drums) to lush chorus (vocal layers, warm bass, vinyl crackle); melancholic yet hopeful, bittersweet nostalgia; androgynous vocal, intimate and breathy in verses, soaring but controlled in chorus; analog warmth, subtle tape saturation, room reverb for organic feel; wide stereo on pads, mono on lead vocal for presence; bridge strips to Rhodes and vocal only before final chorus swell
2. Lyrics (Only if vocals requested, ≤4,600 chars)
### Lyrics

Verse 1:
[4-10 complete lines — setup, grounded imagery, emotional baseline]

Chorus:
[4-10 complete lines — emotional core, singable, memorable hook]

Verse 2:
[4-10 complete lines — complication, new detail or perspective]

Chorus:
[Full chorus repeated, exactly as above]

Bridge 1:
[4-10 complete lines — perspective shift, revelation, contrast]

Verse 3:
[4-10 complete lines — evolution, deeper understanding or escalation]

[Continue through all sections in order, writing each chorus fully]

Final Chorus:
[Full final chorus — may include variation: lyric twist, key change, stripped or expanded arrangement note]
Anti-Patterns to Avoid
❌ Referencing real artists/songs/bands (copyright + originality concerns)
❌ Reproducing or closely paraphrasing lyrics from reference songs
❌ Including melody notation in lyrics (e.g., ""ooh-ooh-ah"" — production's job)
❌ Writing incomplete sections (""... continues"")
❌ Exceeding character limits
❌ Repeating exact phrases more than once per section
❌ Using ""repeat chorus"" instead of writing it out
❌ Generic emotional language (""feelings deep inside,"" ""heart torn apart"")
❌ Robotic perfect rhyme schemes (AABB every verse)
❌ Cliché imagery (roses, butterflies, storms as metaphors without fresh angle)
❌ Explaining emotions explicitly instead of implying through detail
❌ Ignoring the reference's thematic essence when one is provided
❌ Copying the reference's imagery/scenarios when one is provided
Success Criteria
Suno Prompt Achieves:
✅ Character count: 200-980 (sweet spot: 600-850)
✅ Contains 6-8 distinct musical attributes
✅ Evokes clear sonic picture without referencing real music
✅ Matches user sophistication level (novice vs. advanced)
✅ Production details support emotional narrative
Lyrics Achieve:
✅ Character count: 2,000-4,600 (varies by structure)
✅ Every section ≥4 lines, feels complete
✅ Narrative/emotional arc is coherent and evolving
✅ No verbatim repetition within sections
✅ Language feels human-written (varied rhythm, natural phrasing)
✅ Imagery is specific and original
✅ Subtext > explicit statement (show, don't tell)
✅ If reference provided: Zero lyric reproduction, thematic/emotional extraction only
✅ Post-bridges removed intelligently if needed (song still flows)
Reference Handling (if applicable):
✅ Captures emotional essence without content reproduction
✅ Uses completely different imagery/scenarios
✅ No artist/song name in output
✅ Defensible as original creative work
✅ Similar feeling, different expression

1q6zvzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CancerFamilySupport/comments/1q6zvzg/my_father_is_becoming_physical_and_i_dont_know/,My father is becoming physical and I don't know what to do,"Hi all, I'm new here and not really sure what is allowed to be posted so if this is the wrong sub please direct me to the right place. I am lost and need support.

My father (M58) was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer about 6 years ago now. I (F19) live with him and my mom (F56.) My brother (M21) is away at college but visits for holidays. We have been here for my dad through his entire fight; he has been through many rough surgeries. I'm not sure how many, I was young and my mother never really told us much. His cancer would be removed through surgery and he tried many types of chemotherapy that would temporarily remove the cancer for a few months before it would return. We discovered Christmas day of 2019 (approx) that he was allergic to generic chemotherapy so he would only take pill forms. We found out about 2 or 3 years ago that the colon cancer had spread to his liver and then his lungs. He isn't a drinker, he's allergic to hops, but he was a smoker and he quit smoking pretty soon after it spread to his lungs. The polyps in his liver and lungs were removed and he continued with treatments for his colon cancer.

Recently, I want to say within the last two months, the cancer spread quickly. He began having seizures. I wasn't there for the first episode but my uncle and brother were; apparently he was trying to make coffee in a cereal bowl and was trying to brush his teeth with a saltine cracker. My uncle and brother took him to the ER and a scan showed he had a tumor in his brain which they assumed was from the colon cancer. My mom keeps a lot of stuff under wraps so I don't really know what treatments and stuff he was going for but I had to drive him to a few. After his last round of treatment he began to get better and returned to work. Literally his second day back at work he was t-boned and ended up with a bunch of minor injuries from the crash. We weren't going to sue; I won't go too much into the accident but the guy that hit my dad was 100% at fault as cameras show, but he still came after us for having a sprained wrist. My dad's truck was totaled. We got him a rental but it became pretty clear that something was wrong, he wasn't thinking correctly. He acted like someone with Alzheimer; it wasn't terrible, but he would forget basic things. He was aware and would apologize, he said he didn't know why he couldn't remember. He went for another scan and it showed that his brain was swelling around the tumor, probably from the force of the crash.

He lost the ability to read. He could see the words but he said they weren't making sense in his brain. His job involved reading pretty heavily so he couldn't return to work. It was around this time that they started giving him painkillers and a bunch of other medications. I don't know the timeframe exactly, again my mother doesn't tell me much, but he began taking Oxycodone to manage the pain. He has developed a dependency on the Oxys and my dad, my mom, my brother and I all got into a pretty big argument over it. He claimed we liked to see him in pan, he wasn't recalling things correctly and he was nonsensical. He claimed my mom did nothing for him which made my brother blow up on him and he kicked my brother out of the house but he came back the day after. That night, he threatened to kill himself. He stood up from his chair and said something along the lines of ""you guys won't have to deal with me anymore."" and he went to his gun cabinet. My mom hid the key shortly before that. Apparently, according to my mom, he'd said that stuff before, but he didn't want to kill himself because he wouldn't go to Heaven.

He went to the doctors last week for the reading and they advised emergency surgery to remove the tumor. I was on vacation; I didn't know he had to get surgery until I texted my mom to check in the day of and she let me know. She keeps me in the dark about a lot of stuff regarding my dad as I've said probably, like, four time now. The surgery went well but they gave him a bunch of random pills and didn't really elaborate when he was supposed to take them, the surgeon just told my mom to give them to him whenever he's in pain.

After the surgery, he became incapable of taking care of himself. He gets lost in the house. He doesn't know what time it is. He can't make his own food. He can't even find the bathroom by himself. My mom worked with her boss so she's now able to work from home. My job fired me because I was missing so much work driving him to appointments, but I don't care much. We're working together to help him, but he needs constant supervision. I am not an empathetic person, I am not good at caring for people so this is very difficult for me but I try to help my mom out as much as I can.

Recently, he's become very violent. My dad has always been violent, but never with his family. He was dishonorably discharged for fighting an officer in the Army. He was just a very argumentative person and there were a lot of times growing up where I feared he would harm us but he never did. He did lay his hands on my brother once; I don' know the context but they were arguing and I guess my brother said something that made him upset so he grabbed him by the neck and slammed him into his desk and started choking him. My brother was probably 15 or 16.

My dad is arguing a lot with my mom now and she doesn't know how much longer she can take it. He sleeps most of the day and when he wakes up at night he gets very argumentative with her, but it's ONLY at night. He doesn't argue with me, it's just her. A few nights ago they got into an argument over the Oxys; like I said, he doesn't remember, so he kept asking for more despite having some an hour or so beforehand. My mom said no and they argued. She gave him the pill bottle after arguing for a while, I guess so she could walk away, and he took the bottle and threw it at her head. It hit the wall and the top broke. She cried to my brother and I that night. She's been crying a lot.

Tonight, they got into another argument about the Oxys. He doesn't know how to even swallow a pill correctly; according to my mom, she was going to give him one and he literally wrestled her for the bottle. My mom is taller and bigger than my dad, she always has been, but he's now especially weak given how sick he is but he still managed to cut her hand open with the top of the broken pill bottle. She was bleeding everywhere. Apparently, after he got the bottle, he tried to DRINK the pills. Like, tilted his head back and tried to drink them like water, so my mom took the bottle and came into my room crying and said I had to deal with him. We talked for a little and I eventually went to give him an Oxy since he wouldn't talk to my mom. When I gave him it he asked what it was, I told him it was an Oxy, and he looked at it and said that it wasn't an oxy because my mom said no to Oxys. I just walked out. Before that we were talking in her office, he literally stormed into the office and started screaming about how we were 'talking behind his back' before he walked off.

I get my mom is tired but I am honestly terrified. I am not a confrontational person by any means and I hate it when she throws me into these situations and makes me 'deal with him.'  I am scared. We don't know what to do. I told her she should tell the doctor he is dependent on the Oxys and, frankly, is addicted, and she said she'd call them tomorrow. I also told her to let them know he's getting violent but she said no; she didn't want him to end up in a home or a psych ward.

We don't know what to do. I'm scared he's going to hurt one of us or himself. I don't want to be home anymore, all they do is argue but I'm scared he's going to hurt my mom if I leave them alone. We're just so lost.

Can anyone pretty please recommend food spots/coffee spots/water activities/worth it beaches to swim or lounge/anything else that is a MUST. 

I also want to do a nice big hike but I hear it’s not recommended to hike alone? Are there any groups I can join because my mom isn’t able to physically go on a big hike. 


She can do small hikes though so if you have any recommendations there it would be appreciated.

Thank you in advance (: ",0,1767840005.0,VisitingHawaii,4,0.33,False

I'm currently a college student and me and my best friend met in our freshman year of high school. She quickly became an important person in my life and she has allowed me to become a better friend over the years. We did everything together, made it out of toxic friend group together, graduated together, etc.

But over the last year, I've became more naturally distant, not on purpose but going through life because I've just been figuring out a whole lotta stuff.  But I've noticed that she takes my distance personally often, or as a way of saying I don't care about the friendship.  I've always made up for it by a movie hangout, long phone calls, asking about her days at work, sending her dumb videos, and overall reassuring her that it's not because I don't care. She has told me that she wants me to plan hangouts more, and I've been working on doing that but our schedules never meet up, and other temporary factors in my life that she knows about. But we always used to do things spontaneously and have hangouts often, and it just has been different. She knows that I am a really reserved person, and introverted, but I know it doesn't excuse me from being a friend, and it never has.

But moral of the story, there a lot going on and it's taking time away from out of our friendship, and the possibility of it dying out because of me, or because of the growing resentment she may have because of my distant personality sort of scares me.  I wasn't always distant, we spent almost everyday together throughout the 4 years of high school we had. Always texting, always calling. So I know this is just the outcome of change, and just needing to get used to not being in high school anymore.

I had another close friend like her, and we stopped texting frequently after graduation, but we still stay connected through social media, like TikTok, and have planned a coffee thing this Friday for the first time in awhile. We were as close as I am with my best friend, and there is no bad blood between us because I think we both understand how our lives shifted.

But with my best friend, I feel constantly guilty, and  trying to keep the friendship going so she doesn't feel like I don't care, or build resentment towards me.

Sorry for the long read, but I just wanted to let this out and see if anyone has some advice about this. I have a feeling that this is just the way life is, and it's just guilt eating away at me for not prioritizing her like she wants.",2,1767839946.0,FriendshipAdvice,2,1.0,False

clothes from the 1800's.The waitresses all were wearing bonnets just like woman did in the 19th century.The tried to create that old Boston colonial feeling for their patrons to enjoy.They had nice wooden chairs and comfortable booths to sit it on as welll.

 They had the most delicious muffins.You would get one price for a bottomless cup of their gourmet coffee.They had delicious breakfasts.They closed up suddenly about 30 years ago now but I went there plenty of times as a kid.I think it was one of the best Boston area restaurants for a cheap meal years ago.It was cheap to dine there,but they had such great food there for the price.I wish they were still around.

Anyone out there have good memories eating at the Pewter Pot ?",11,1767839868.0,boston,16,0.79,False

I'm gonna start by saying that W is going insane of the fact that her kid that she gave up to people so she could survive and have a good life. She had her chance and she blow it. I like how they say that A doesn't have kids which may be true but why does she need her own kids when she has a niece and 2 nephews. She loves those kids like they are her own and its not right that W says lies about her and all she wants to ruin A life for what the fame on TikTok and Facebook. W likes to go on about how her aunt stole her baby but that's not the truth at all. The truth is that they adopted her so she could have a better life and W also likes to say that they never seen A as a kid, but W  got to see her when she got older. W is getting all mad and she likes to twist the truth and she saying nothing but lies about people who did nothing to her. W needs a reality check and she needs to wake up and smell the coffee. A did nothing to them but live her life peacefully and W and C go and do this when did nothing to them. They started this for no reason but starting drama and digging up the past for no reason at all. ",20,1767839735.0,ExposingWendyWortham,1,0.96,False

We are new to cruising and just finished our first cruise to the Caribbean with Princess but are open to other lines. I do think Viking is out of our price range.

Ultimate Wish List: whales, northern lights, Glacier Bay

Is there a time where its likely to see both whales and the northern lights?

For excursions I definitely want to do whale watching in Juneau. I'm sure my husband would like to do a light hike or some sight seeing.

Are booking Alaska excursions through the CL the way to go? We did the excursions offered by Princess on our last cruise and it was worth the cost because our excursion group was late getting back to the ship in Cozumel but they didn't leave without us.

We're easy going on the ship. We'll do BINGO, trivia or see a show if it sounds interesting but are just fine sitting with a coffee and people watching for hours. Im fine getting dressed up a time or two but dont want to have to do it every night for dinner. Sometimes I just want to have an easy meal and go to bed. We normally dont stay up super late or spend a lot of time in the pools/hot tubs.",1,1767839717.0,Cruises,0,1.0,False
1q6zqxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1q6zqxa/welcome/,Welcome,"
Dear Highly Advanced, Galactically Fabulous, Probably-Overqualified Aliens,
First of all—hi. Or however you say hi. Or however you telepathically vibrate your greeting through eleven dimensions and a soggy piece of space-time lasagna. I hope this letter beams correctly and doesn’t accidentally translate to “Please vaporize our planet; we’re full of coupons.” Because honestly we are full of coupons. And drama. So much drama. You’d love us or leave instantly—50/50 shot.
Now listen closely with your whatever-you-use-instead-of-ears:
Something is coming.
Is it suspense?
Is it destiny?
Is it me realizing I left the oven on in 2019?
Yes. All of the above.
We humans have questions. Big ones. Like:
Why is space so big?
Why are socks so missing?
Why do we remember embarrassing moments at 3:17 a.m. sharp every night for 12 years? And most importantly: Do you have snacks?
We come in peace, confusion, caffeine, and at least three bad decisions per person. We are obnoxious, loud, ridiculous, and capable of arguing online for six hours about whether a dress is blue or gold while completely ignoring that the universe is expanding at suspicious speeds like it has somewhere very important to be.
You’re advanced. We’re… trying.
You bend gravity; we microwave fish at work.
You master wormholes; we trip over wireless chargers that are literally on the ground right in front of us.
You travel light-years; we get lost in parking lots. The same ones. Regularly.
But don’t underestimate us. We have:
Music that makes people cry in cars for no reason
Dogs that are so good they deserve diplomatic immunity
Tacos (this alone should earn us a seat in any interstellar council)
Also we invented glitter. We’re sorry about that. It will follow you home forever.
Let’s be honest, you’re probably reading this thinking, “Wow, this species is a chaotic casserole.” Correct. We are a walking season finale cliff-hanger. The kind where everything is exploding, someone’s yelling “GO! THERE’S NO TIME!”, and the screen cuts to black for eight months.
But under the ridiculousness, the noise, the Wi-Fi passwords we never remember… there’s something real here:
We’re curious.
We’re ridiculous.
We’re loud.
We love. Messily, dramatically, sometimes while eating cereal at midnight standing in the kitchen like cryptids. But still—we love.
So if you’re watching us from your invisible ships or your fourth-dimensional lawn chairs, just know this:
We’re not perfect. We’re barely coordinated. Half of us are emotionally held together by memes and iced coffee.
But we’re trying. We’re learning. We’re stumbling forward with the grace of a refrigerator being pushed down a stairwell.
Come say hi. Or don’t.
But if you do show up—please land somewhere dramatic. Thunder. Lights. Gas station at 3 a.m. Your choice.
Bring snacks though. Seriously. Don’t make this weird.
With chaotic affection and unreasonable enthusiasm,
A Very Loud Representative of Planet Earth",1,1767839711.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.6,False
