1khwyed,https://www.reddit.com/r/greyhairreversal/comments/1khwyed/grey_hair_solutions/,Grey Hair Solutions?,"I'm a 31 yo male whose already noticing grey hairs sprouting up in my beard and on my head. It's a bit early given my genetics and it seems like it's really accelerated within the past few months. 

I started noticing years ago that my coffee addiction was resulting in grey hairs here and there, but since it's a delicious beverage, I just ignored them. I was also a vegetarian, but I was honestly lazy and didn't eat a diverse diet or take supplements, so I truly believe that I'm still dealing with some kind of vitamin deficiency. 

I stopped drinking caffeine a year ago a switched to decaf, but the grey hairs keep coming. I also recently noticed that white spots have been appearing on my fingers nails, which I've read can be a symptom of a vitamin deficiency, so that's encouraged me to get my health in order. I started taking a liquid iron supplement around 2 months ago, but I haven't noticed any major changes. I also started taking zinc, which without copper, seems to just be making my grey hair worse, though the white spots have started to go away. I recently had my levels tested, and my doctor said my iron was low, but not to the point where it would be causing health problems. 

Honestly, the only thing I've noticed that has any immediate effect is when I eat a ton of spinach or some kind of leafy green. Normally the morning after, I'll notice less grey hair. But if I go a few days without, they'll be more visible, so that's leading me to think it's linked to my nutrition and not genetics. 

Anyone have any tips? As of now, I'm trying to eat more red meat, more spinach and I'm planning on stocking up on zinc, copper and B12 vitamins. ",1,1746727818.0,greyhairreversal,0,1.0,False
1khwy5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiSexTalk/comments/1khwy5f/she_definitely_won_round_2/,She definitely won round 2,"We must have dozed off for a bit in each other's arms after our mini marathon earlier (feel free to dog up my previous posts here for more context), and it felt like I was floating in a zone between slumber and awareness, enjoying the bliss of the way she smelt, her intoxicating hair and the radiating warmth of her body against mine. You know the kind of state where you're not yet fully awake and you know it's only a dream but you still enjoy it? Only, I wasn't so sure if I could feel her fingers around my cock for real, as she stroked it slowly, which to my surprise twitched in response.

She said softly, ""You just had to tie me up hmm?""

I can't remember what I said, but knowing myself and my (self proclaimed) way with witty retorts, I'm sure it must have been a really smartish grunt. I don't think she waited for my reply though as I felt her weight shift a little and her grip tighten on my rising boner. Fuck I have met my match, she's as insatiable as me. The way she held it just felt so damn good.

""And what was that all about...shoving my dirty panties in my mouth...?"" she trailed off as her slender fingers closed around my now throbbing shaft. She teased the head with her thumb, ""I loved it..."" she completed with a naughty smile, as she rubbed across the overly sensitive head deliberately, ever so slowly over and over again. She seemed to be exploring every bump and ridge along the length of my cock as she teased me. Now, that woke me up in an instant.

P leaned in for a kiss, ""Sssshhhh, it's my turn now you bad bad boy"" and I hated how much she turned me on with that cliche. Her voice has that mesmerizing quality about it, and she knew the effect it had on me. She was playing with my cock, rubbing the oozing pre-cum all over the knob, making it glisten with my wetness. She raked a lone finger along my balls and grabbed the base of my cock tighter, stroking it harder and faster. She looked at me and licked her lips as she sat up and pulled her hair back, leaning in.

She slowly licked just the head of my cock in a way that sent shivers through my spine and I half sat up with a jolt. ""Mmm...we taste good together baby, don't we!"" She licked along the length, up and down. She moved back up to the knob and sucked just the tip now, and I couldn't stop a groan escape from what she was doing to me. How does she fucking know my body so well! It's like we have made love to each other all our lives, only we didn't!

She cupped my balls and tickled it as she took the whole shaft in her mouth, making slurping sounds. Fuck, her mouth just felt so so good. I looked on as she bobbed up and down taking me on a wild ride along. She pushed me back on the bed and kept going hungrily, making sexy noises as she sucked, stroking and playing with my balls at the same time. I held her hair back with one hand and pushed inside her mouth. I could feel her gag a little, as she came up for air but went back to her true form immediately. She looked up at me, smiled and spit on the head of my cock, not breaking the gaze. 

Holy fuck that look! She kept gazing deep into my eyes as she rubbed her spit all over my cock and said ""You taste just like the way I imagined you to..."" She went down again on me hungrier if that was even possible. She reached down and played with her pussy as I felt the wet warmth of her mouth engulfing my senses. She could feel my balls twitch aching to cum as she sucked on harder and faster. She pushed a finger inside her, and I just about groaned ""I'm gonna cum P..., I'm gonna cum"". She just clamped down harder in response as I let go and fell back on the bed. I could only see the back of her head moving up and down my glistening dick rhythmically as I came next. She didn't let go of me until I spasmed for the last time groaning as I shot jet after jet of my hot cum inside her devouring mouth. She swallowed every last drop of it.

She licked me clean as I struggled against her mouth and begged her to stop, unable to handle the wave after wave of shock and pleasure each time she licked my sensitive knob. She gently kissed the top of the head, along the sides of the shaft and my balls, cupping them lightly and squeezing them playfully before she let go a tad bit reluctantly. ""That's for tying me up, and NO we're not even yet"" she said with a mock scowl on her face.

""Yeah? But babe, If that's what you are gonna do, I think I'm still winning...no?"" I retorted.

""You're just horrible"" she laughed as she punched me on my arm playfully. We kissed. I just couldn't have enough of this goddess. Why did we miss out on all these years? I wondered silently as she snuggled comfortably on my shoulders. We made plans for the rest of the evening, and decided to go down to the restaurant downstairs for dinner a bit later. That place boasted of some superb Italian food which is her favourite.

P stopped abruptly in the middle of a sentence, and seemed a little lost for a second. Her eyes darted across the room, scanning everything intently. She was clearly searching for something. It took me a few seconds to realise she was trying to locate her discarded panties for the evening date. We were able to find the missing culprit eventually lying in one corner of the bed. It was not in a good condition at the moment to put it mildly. The oil, wine, and our bodily fluids  had left it in a terrible mess of a wet, damp rag.

""And what do you think I'll wear for dinner mister? You remember what you did with my panties?"" she said holding it up in one hand and waving it around. She's looked so cute all worked up like this.

""Mm...and your point is...? How's that a problem? We're not going for dinner in our underwears now, are we? I mean, I'd obviously love it, but I don't think It's that kind of a place miss""

She looked down for a second, and flashed a smiled as she looked up at me again.

""S, you know you're evil"" she couldn't mask the excitement in her voice though.

I knew she loved the idea and was already picturing us sitting in the restaurant in peak hours, full of people, wih her in such a nice, classy dress...without her panties on.

""I know, I know..."" I agreed in all earnest.

We eventually had some coffee, and decided to freshen up and get going. We took a quick shower together (to save water and for no other reasons obviously), and managed to thankfully keep it limited to only making out like a couple of horny teens. It was really hard watching the water trickle down the curves of her sexy body and still stay relatively calm. The only thing that helped us gain the right perspective was the anticipation of the evening that awaited us. The excitement in the air was palpable, and we both couldn't wait for the upcoming adventure we were to embark on. 

She looked like a million dollars in the sexy blue dress once again. The way it stuck to her sexy slender frame, hugging her curves in exactly all the right places was chef's kiss. It really accentuated her ass the way she slowly, and deliberately undulated her waist as if to challenge my willpower. Especially knowing that she wasn't wearing any panties under that, made it nearly impossible for me to stop myself from slapping her bums a couple of times which made her welp in surprise. I just smiled at her, took her hands in mine as I led her to the elevator.",1,1746727803.0,DesiSexTalk,1,1.0,False

1khwv61,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1khwv61/most_if_not_all_of_my_first_dates_seem_to_go_well/,"Most, if not all, of my first dates seem to go well. So why do the women I'm meeting suddenly lose interest before date #2, and is this becoming a trend for me?","Hi! Sorry for the long post.

I'm (33 M) a single father who has started dating after separating from the mother of my toddler last August. I am upfront about this on my Hinge profile, which is how I am meeting women lately. However, I tend not to talk about it on dates unless they mention it or ask. I started dating again just a few months ago and have been on about 10 first dates, all of which I would say went well except for 1. However many of these women seem to lose interest or ghost after the first date and it's starting to confuse/worry me. Disclaimer: I do not sleep around on the first date.

I'm beginning to wonder if it's something I'm doing, saying, or some vibe I'm giving off and I don't know what. I've been told that i’m outgoing and follow rules 1 and 2. I'm 6'5'', blonde, athletic, hold a steady job, and I like to think I don't have a shit personality although I'm obviously not perfect. I don't tend to have a problem getting matches or breaking the ice with women, but I go for quality over quantity. I don't go for tons of matches, I focus my time and energy on 1 or 2 people to see if its a good fit. The 10 women have all been different , yet each of them seems to fall off or ghost entirely after our first date, even though they seem to enjoy the date. Am I missing something? Any insight would be appreciated.

For anyone interested, here's a rundown of my most recent date from a few days ago:

I met this woman for dinner. She is 30, attractive, 5'10"", works a government job, and is relatively new to my area. I suggested we meet up to celebrate Cinco De Mayo, as it is a popular holiday where we live in So Cal. She agrees, and seems excited for Mexican culture because she moved down from Nor Cal a year and a half ago. Side note: neither of us is Hispanic, we are both white. I thought this would be a good opportunity to take her out and show her a good time. 

I asked her to pick me up because my place is on the way and parking can be difficult. She agrees. We walk the downtown area of our city for about 20 minutes before grabbing dinner at an upscale Mexican restaurant of my choosing. Funnily enough, we ran into two of her coworkers at the restaurant. They had just finished dining as we were being seated. She introduced us and we had a short back and forth that seemed to go well.

We sit, order food and a cocktail each, There's steady conversation, we are getting to know each other, our backgrounds, our families, work, there's jokes, some laughter, etc. I thought things were going really well, and she seemed engaged, albeit slightly shy and nerdy. She even admitted she was. Totally fine by me, I'm kind of a jack-of-all-trades guy but definitely a big nerd too. I dabble in a bunch of different hobbies and she seemed to as well. So green flags there. We both enjoy cooking, fitness, art, the same film/tv (we both chose Babadook and The Descent as two of our go-to horror movie suggestions), amongst several other interests that made me think this girl could be a good match for me. 

When the bill came I was prepared to pay, as I usually do on first dates, however she offered to split it and I though that was really nice of her so we did. I should mention that I tend to keep it more casual and do a coffee walk for a first date, I'll admit I am getting more cautious of this and I usually don't do dinner on a first date unless I'm really feeling the other person like I was this time. I am tired of getting burned after paying for dates and it makes me feel used.

Anyway, this is where I noticed a slight shift in the dynamic between us. I got up to use the restroom before we left, and when I did I noticed she was receiving notifications of messages from other men on Hinge. Alright, no biggie. I get it. We're both probably talking to other people, I'm not naïve enough to think I'm the only guy she's been talking to. When I came back from the restroom she was chatting with our server, a nice young girl, whom we agreed was excellent and gave good service. We even told her we were on our first date and she made some jokes about how it seemed like it was going well between us, that we wouldn't ghost one other, and there would be a second date. Looking back this seemed like an omen of sorts lol!

After sitting back down it felt like her attitude towards me had changed. She seemed less interested, didn't talk as much or ask questions, and said we should get going because it's almost her bed time and she wants to be up at 4am for the gym early. It was like 8:30pm btw. 

So we left , she even physically distanced herself from me slightly more as we walked back to the car. All just small things I picked up on. The ride home felt a little awkward too. I didn't want to talk that much or distract her because she had mentioned she is a very bad driver when she picked me up and, oh boy, she wasn't kidding. This girl should be re-tested for her driver's license. I was actually worried for our safety at times, but luckily we made it back to my place in one piece.

She pulled up and we each said we had a good time together. I said I would normally invite her inside for a cup of tea or something but I knew she wanted to get going so I said I wanted to see her again and she agreed. I didn't go in for the kiss or anything overly romantic because it didn't feel right and she was giving off signals that she wasn't wanting it. So we hugged and that was it. I remember walking back to my front door thinking ""I want to see this girl again but something tells me I never will.""

She lives about 20 minutes from me, so I waited about 30 and texted her,

""hope you made it home to your cat."" (10:06pm)

Her: “I did! Thank you!” (6:04am the following day)

Me: “Ok good, and how was the gym? You must be really feeling it today” (8:52am)

Her: “I’m sorry, but to be honest with you I’m just not feeling it and would rather not pursue this any longer. You seem like a good person and I hope the best for you.” (4:17pm the following day)

Me: “For sure, I understand. I guess I’m just kind of surprised because I thought things were going well between us and we have a lot in common. So I know going forward, was it something in particular I did or said, is it a sexual chemistry thing, what’s the main reason why you aren’t feeling it? (4:29pm)

Me: “Aww cmon, don’t do me dirty like that. At least help a brother out with a little constructive feedback 😂” (7:28pm the following day)

Her: “it was just the chemistry for me” (7:46pm)

Me: “That’s pretty vague. If there was no chemistry then why were we vibing at dinner? I sensed a shift in your mood when I returned from the bathroom at dinner, and again on the drive home.” (7:54pm)

Her: proceeds to block me*


I asked about her gym workout and how she must be sore because at dinner she mentioned she was already feeling it from multiple days of lifting. Then she pulls the 180 switch up on me and eventually blocks me when I ask for a more specific explanation of things. Perhaps I shouldn't have pursued a deeper reason but I didn't feel like I was being unreasonable when she was being so vague. 

What do you think is going on? How do you think I handled it and could I have done something differently? That's all I'm trying to understand here. Is this something I have control over or is it something beyond my ability to change or improve?

Thanks

Here’s the link →[ 2-Hour Study with Me / Peaceful Music & Rain Sounds / Pomodoro 50-10 / Desk & Plants Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgyrx5YrHfk)

\----------

Today I prepared a brand new 2-hour study video for you. During the focus sessions, you will hear peaceful piano and rain sounds, and during the breaks, you will enjoy calming music. The gentle rain in the background creates a relaxing and focused atmosphere, perfect for deep work or study. We are following the Pomodoro technique with two 50-minute focus sessions and 10-minute breaks in between for a balanced and productive study experience. 🌧️🎶  
  
→ Study method: 50 minutes focus / 10 minutes break ✍️☕  
  
▹ This video is available in HD quality 🎥  
  
I created this video to help you stay away from social media and stay focused. Pomodoro is one of the most effective methods for working and studying. At my desk, with a simple coffee and a few cozy details, I’m here to keep you company while the rain softly falls outside 🪴☕🌧️

I’m working on a university project about branding, SDGs, and sustainability. We’re designing a campaign for a well-known coffee brand tied to a big winter sports event (think 2026).

One idea we’re exploring is an AR (augmented reality) experience during the event, where participants “travel” through Meta, Colombia — a region once known for coca plantations, now transformed by coffee farming. The experience would tell a story of social redemption and environmental change, showing how coffee became a symbol of resilience and hope.

I know it’s just a student project, but we’ve really put our hearts into it and want to make it meaningful.

1khwo06,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1khwo06/aita_for_going_on_a_strike_silence_in_my_office/,AITA for going on a strike silence in my office?,"Hi potatos! This is my first post ever on reddit and I need your petty help on the situation I'm living. 

Clarification, English is not my first language.

>!&#x200B;!<   
A while ago I had a ""fight"" with my coworkers about the silliest thing and now the whole office dinamic has changed completly, to the point I'm treated like I'm not there anymore. So, it's a little long, but I'll lay out the context.  


A year ago I rejoined my office, which I left breafly for an opportunity abroad that at the end didn't happen. Before I left, we were only 3 people, me (28 F), Sally (32 F) and Joe (40 M). We would get along really well and had a really nice time with each other. We had the same office ""rules"" and would chat, even though we are not from the same departments. They had their comments about marriage, kids, politics and other things I perhaps didn't feel comfortable or agreed with, but surfed it through and understand we are from different generations. 

In the period I left and got back to work full time on the office, there were two new people added: Katy (20 F) and Ally (23 F). The first works under Joe and the second was my replacement, but know we work as a team. 

To say the dinamics and energy at the office change is something, but it really hit a new level which I didn't quite catch until very late. These new girls were completely different and let's say ""brought"" a new light on my coworkers. Cant' really describe it fully, but let's say Katy is really a gen z and Ally more reserved and with some odd attitudes that didn't quite fit at the beginning. It's like with the addition of this two planets, the whole solar system went into mercury retrogade. 

My other two coworkers shifted and started to behave like teenagers at highschool. They would ""shape"" (aka bully) Ally to behave like they thought is appropiate in the office while complying to every Katy's demand or say. They insterted themselves like ""parents"" and ""child"" in a very weird and honestly uncomfortable way. The topics of chat became more ""open"", but for me it was over the line to know how was the fucking last weekend. 

  
During this time, we would still get along well, but in retrospective, I should have known that everything was completely different. 

On to the ""fight"". 

We had an arrange of desks where I was sitting next to Sally, but only temporary until her boss brings ""someone new"" to help her with her work. That promise has been around over a year by the time of this kerfuffle. Out of the blue, she tells me that her boss is actually asking for her desk and I say, ""alright, do you need it by tomorrow or next week is fine?"" which she only tells me ""I don't know"". I ask Joe if I could go back to my previous seat, which was next to Katy, but they gave me the run around and said ""their boss wants to bring down some boxes, so they don't have much space left"". Basically, they were kicking me out and not move a finger. I was at the moment getting really upset, because they would push me to sit with my back to the door and the screen of my computer showing to anybody who's passing through the hallway. Not comfortable or private at all. In my discomfort, I say that ""if there's no other spot, I can move out of office's then"", which they didn't like, but gave me no other solution. The conversation end up, I talk with the IT deparment and ask them for a new line and that was that for the day.

The following day I showed up and did something really out of my character and just sit down on my new spot, very uncomforable with all the situation. They didn't say anything and the day went by. When I come back home I was really sad and upset with all of the situation, expecting from them (the older and seniors of the office) to say or do something, but they didn't. I though ""well, somebody has to"", so the next day I went with a more pacific attitude and ""rise the white flag"" to talk to them. I thought that maybe if I reach to them like the three coworkers we once were, everything would be fine. 

**Man, I was dead wrong.** 

Not only backfired terribly, they accused me that ""since I got back, I was changed"" (basically, I'm older 30 F now and not a young idiot they can pick on). That the whole desk situation was my fault. That the dinamic didn't changed. And that if they changed their attituded towards me, is because of me. Finally, cherry on top, they accused me of stealing money. For 3 months they kept to themselves that something I bought ""didn't add up"". Mind you this was something Sally particularly pointed out, while Joe just stood there and said or do nothing. I was so in shock that I just silenced up, but ended up crying in front of my boss later. In my whole life someone accused me of stealing money for buying a pack of coffee for the whole office. 

From that day onwards, I would come to the office, say good moorning, sit and work. It has been a whole year of this situation and the passive agressive ""mean girls"" attitudes just keep growing, to the point I'm not longer existing in this place. Just yesterday, on a call, Joe said ""yeah, in the office it's me, Katy, Sally and Ally"". Erased from existence. Their whole ""mom, dad and daughter/teenage mean girls"" is gotten worse and I'm a loss of what to do. 

So, potatos, AITA for just going on a strike of silence in my office? Any petty advice? I'm not really good with those types of comebacks, but I wish there was a way to show them how ridiculus they are being. Thank you!",1,1746727156.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

We know there’s a lot of noise out there. Every hour it’s a new dog, frog, or dead dev meme coin popping off on Reddit like it’s the second coming of PEPE.
But deep down, you’re tired.
Tired of chasing ghosts.
Tired of sniffing rugs.

But then… you find Peter Sniffin.

Yeah. That Peter.

YOU EVER SEEN A MAN THIS READY TO SNAP?
Peter ain’t sipping. He’s sniffin'.

White Monster in the bloodstream.
Gold chain round the neck.
Snus tin? Not in the lip —
He snaps that thing open and inhales like it’s pre-launch alpha.

This ain’t coffee. This is beast fuel.
Once Peter cracks the White Monster?
It’s no thoughts, just charts.
No dips, just flips.
No sleep, just sniff.

Sniffin’ season is open.
And Peter’s not waiting for utility.
He is the utility.

He doesn’t trade.
He charges.

You’re either sniffin' with him…
Or getting trampled in the clout stampede.

What’s a girl to do?

Dive into this deliciously absurd and darkly humorous peek inside the world's oldest profession.

Told through a series of encounters with real clients, this unhinged nonfiction recounts the misadventures of a socially awkward college student as she fumbles her way through the salacious world of escorting.

While recalling unforgettable stories, Silversmith shares her unique insight into the business practices of call girl agencies and the everyday lives of American sex workers.

At times tragic, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, this is a book you won't be able to put down.

About the author:
Long since graduated from college and her days moonlighting as an entertainer, E. S. Silversmith lives in the misty pineforests of the Pacific North West. Passionate about the medical field, she currently works in oncology. When she isn't caring for patients or wandering the mossy trails, E.

1khwkfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/qelbree/comments/1khwkfe/review_9_months_on_qelbree_success_story/,review: 9 months on qelbree (success story??),"**Overview**

* I'm keeping an ongoing reddit log of my experience on qelbree
* I'm a 32 year woman, podcast producer, adhd combined-type
* I really struggle with stimulants medication and want there to be more non-stimulant medications for people with adhd
* I know that a lot of people post when they have *bad* experiences so I'm hoping to document a potentially positive or more neutral experience
* [Post about my first 6 months on qelbree ](https://www.reddit.com/r/qelbree/comments/1ic9pfl/comment/mk17q91/?context=3)
* [Post about my first 2 months on qelbree](https://www.reddit.com/r/qelbree/comments/1g5sywz/documenting_my_experience_on_qelbree_2_months/)
* [Post about my first three weeks on qelbree](https://www.reddit.com/r/qelbree/comments/1f2ohp6/documenting_my_qelbree_experience_so_far/)
* [Post about my first month on qelbree](https://www.reddit.com/r/qelbree/comments/1ff4woe/documenting_my_experience_with_qelbree_week_4/)

  
**Dosage:** 

* Been on 300mg since November of 2024 — gradually worked my way up there from 100mg (started in August)

  
**Current experience:** 

How Qelbree **is working for me.** 

* I feel less anxious, less depressed, and more motivated on qelbree. It's easier for me to get out of bed in the morning, it's easier for me to start tasks and leave the house, essentially I think it really helps me do a lot of the little stuff in my life that I struggle with. I feel like I'm doing more big picture thinking about my life and what i want to do in the future (which does cause some anxiety, but that seems p normal the future is scary especially when you've never really thought about it...). In short, I think that qelbree *helps me help myself.* 

* I think it's also helped me become more in touch with my emotions. I'm somebody who is highly analytical (at least about myself lol), I think really deeply about my life  and relationships. However, through therapy I've really been getting more into the somatic experience of my feelings versus the intellectual experience of them...and wow! There's a lot there. I'm unpacking years of built up shame, resentment, and sadness. Shoutout to my therapist as well of course. 

* The other big thing it's really helped with is my relationship to my body. I've yo-yo dieted for years. I've gotten really into working out and then stopped completely. Basically I have a frenetic and unpredictable relationship to my own health and have felt frustrated with my inability to be consistent -- consistently!!! But on qelbree, I've started and maintained a really low key workout routine. And now more recently a diet that's very manageable for me. I'm eating 1500 to 1800 calories a day and walking more. I've lost 10 pounds. And most importantly it's something I feel like I can keep up. WHICH IS SO COOL BECAUSE ITS MAKING ME THINK WOW THE WAY TO CREATE CHANGE IN YOUR LIFE IS JUST THE THING THAT EVERYONE ALWAYS SAID...SLOWLY AND SUSTAINABLY AND IT MAKES ME WONDER IF I CAN DO THIS SUCCESSFULLY WHAT ELSE CAN I DO SUCCESSFULLY? Basically my whole life has felt like holding a big boulder in place on a hill that I'm always sort of worried will crush me and now i'm sort of like...pushing it up and over that hill I think. Sisyphus no more, bitch. 

How Qelbree **is not working for me.**

* Qelbree doesn't really help with my focus. In fact, I sort of suspect it's ... making it worse. I am having the adhd mega-mind problem of being so distracted while doing my job, I don't even realize I am distracted until hours and hours have passed. This has always been the case for me, but I sort of suspect it's slightly worse? That's not awesome, but considering all the emotional and relational benefits it's given me I'm actually willing to take it as a trade off. 

* I am considering asking my psych np / prescriber if I could consider supplementing qelbree with a low dose of a stimulant. I stopped taking the anti-anxiety medication I was on because it was inducing extreme bouts of rage (I listened to sympathy is a knife 100 times one day). But I wonder if I could take a stimulant 2-3 times a week when my job is particularly busy. I historically hate stimulants but here we are. 

  
Other stuff: 

* My sleep is awesome now — it was so messed up for months and months on this medication 
* I actually am back to drinking coffee and feel fine -- but just one per day
* I have a lot of regret that I did not get better help for my adhd earlier in life. I feel like I wasted my education, because i never paid attention to anything I was learning and I also had a lot of intense and messy relationships. I don't really know what to do with my life but I guess I will find out.  I am working on acceptance I guess! ",1,1746726912.0,qelbree,0,1.0,False
1khwkc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrizzlySMS/comments/1khwkc0/i_created_10_gmail_accounts_using_temporary/,I Created 10 Gmail Accounts Using Temporary Numbers — AMA!,"Alright, Reddit, let’s get weird. Over the past month, I decided to see how many Gmail accounts I could create using temporary phone numbers. Why? Because I’m tired of spam, paranoid about data leaks, and honestly, just curious. Spoiler: It’s possible, but *not* all services are created equal.

# Why Bother with Temporary Numbers?

In the U.S., these numbers aren’t just for spies. People use them for:

* Privacy: Keep your real number off sketchy mailing lists.
* Multi-Accounting: Separate work, personal, and *questionable* Reddit alt accounts.
* Testing: Need 10 emails for app trials, coupons, or burner projects? Done.
* Security: If one account gets hacked, the rest stay safe.

# The Experiment

I tried 5 different temporary number services. Here’s the breakdown:

* 3/5 worked reliably with Google (spoiler: Grizzly SMS is one of them).
* 2/5 failed — either codes never arrived or numbers were already recycled.
* Time per account: \~2 minutes once I found the right service.

The Good, the Bad, and the “Why Did I Even Try This”  
Pros:

* No spam: My personal number is still clean (for now).
* Easy to manage: Each account has a purpose (e.g., “Netflix Trial #3”).
* Cost: Most services charge <$1 per number. Cheaper than a coffee.

Cons:

* Ghosted by Google: Some numbers triggered “suspicious activity” warnings.
* Recycled numbers: One account got locked because someone else reused *my* temp number.
* Ethical gray zone: Google’s TOS frowns on this, but hey — I’m just a curious human.

# How I Made It Work

After rage-quitting two providers, Grizzly SMS [temporary phone number for Gmail verification](https://grizzlysms.com/gmail?utm_source=reddit) saved the day. Their numbers worked instantly for 8/10 accounts. The other two? My bad — I forgot to disable my VPN. Pro tip: Google hates VPNs + temp number combos.

# Why This Matters

Freelancers: Need separate emails for clients? Temp numbers keep things tidy.

* Privacy nerds: Avoid linking your identity to every account.
* Coupon addicts: Sign up for 10 “20% off” deals without drowning in spam.

FAQ (Preemptively Answering Your Questions):

* *“Will Google ban these accounts?”* Not yet, but don’t push it.
* *“Can I recover accounts later?”* Nope — these are disposable.
* *“What’s the best service?”* I’ll just say… [Grizzly SMS](https://grizzlysms.com/gmail?utm_source=reddit) had the least drama.

# Ask Me Anything

Seriously. How many accounts did I lose? Which service leaked my IP? Why does Google care so much about my burner life? Let’s chat.

1khwj2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/buffy/comments/1khwj2v/my_rewrite_for_the_season_5_finale_ending_to_have/,My rewrite for the season 5 finale ending to have it work as a series finale,"This is largely a vanity project on my part- I’ll preface by saying that while I love and appreciate most of season 6 it doesn’t really work as an end to the series. I understand season 7 is divisive and while I like elements of the finale a recent post on here detailing another users frustration with it got me thinking about how great the season 5 finale was- the stakes felt high, the emotional payoff was huge, and the series core themes were reinforced in a hugely cathartic way for the viewer.

Obviously if I were to rewrite the entire series I don’t think I would end the show with Buffy’s death- however I got thinking about what I liked thematically in the season 7 finale and how I would apply that to a finale where I thought all the plot mechanics and story elements actually worked well. The thematic elements worked in season 7 at the finish line but I don’t think the payoff of the season long arc was satisfying in the way season 5’s finale was.

Please don’t roast me and let me know what you think of this! I think although this would have spinoff potential to keep the series going without Buffy I kind of just wanted to come up with a separate canon for if season 5 was truly where they ended it that didn’t make it such a hopeless series finale without having to rewrite the entire season also. I also challenged myself to cherry pick the elements I liked from the last two seasons in particular the series finale so this is a bit of a Frankenstein’s monster of a job. Let me know if you’d make any changes to this!

Ok here we go;

Firstly- I think The Gift desperately would’ve needed to be expanded into a 2 part episode like Becoming for it to work as a series finale. I think it would need to be padded out a bit with a little more closure to the arcs of some of the main characters by incorporating more positive elements of their arcs from the next 2 seasons. I also would not end the series with Buffy’s tombstone as the final shot- for me, it works well in the context of a season finale but feels too desolate as a final image for a show that featured so much humour. Also I would add flowers to the grave itself (more on that later).

Basically the final scene wouldn’t be her friends crying over Buffy’s dead body or the tombstone (although we would still include those shots) but would also incorporate a slight time jump and then a larger one afterwards.

Most importantly, the tower scene would feature an extended monologue from Buffy to Dawn that would continue in voiceover over her body and then the tombstone shot. This monologue would touch on more elements of the positive takeaways from season 6 and 7. After that we would see individual shots of our main characters readjusting to life or grieving in some capacity, or feeling the absence of Buffy while the monologue continued. Healed injuries consistent with the final battle would show that this is still kind of fresh but likely post burial of Buffy.

Xander could be shown looking at a contract for the rebuild of Sunnydale high- or better yet overseeing the demolition of the remains of Sunnydale high, with the implication being a new one is to be built. Anya could show up with coffee for him and engagement ring visible and a burnt copy of their yearbook if we really needed to drive home what the building being demolished was. It could be shown open to a candid black and white photo of the core 3 with Giles neat handwriting below “the earth is definitely doomed- Rupert Giles” before the wrecking ball hits the building, a nod to Xander as the glorified bricklayer picking up a spare. 

Willow could be shown visiting Joyce’ grave with Tara and placing flowers that were also seen growing on Buffy’s grave (in my version). Better yet- if we acknowledge that we are skipping over her magical addiction metaphor show her growing them directly from the earth with Tara’s help confident for the first time and at peace, confident in her magical abilities. The monologue meanwhile would be Buffy telling Dawn to tell Willow/Xander how strong she is and to never doubt themselves or what they are able to do, and that Buffy would’ve never gotten that far without the help of her friends. 

Show Giles in the magic box deep in research mode, surrounded by the watchers diaries. He pulls from a shelf the old Vampyre book from season 1 looking troubled. He’s sitting down about to open it before being distracted- smiling wistfully at a memory of Buffy rejecting it in the hold library. He puts it back on the shelf. She figured it out, and she’s ok. He knows there will never be another slayer with her incredible self awareness. 

The monologue is basically just expanding on the takeaways about what she’s “figured out” with the help of each character shown on screen. It’s driving home that she was uniquely gifted as a slayer because of the love and support she had. 

people will be divided on whether a message for Spike is necessary or not- choose your own adventure there. I don’t know how reasonable it is to expect Buffy to stand atop the tower monologuing for that long so maybe we would have it switch to Dawns voiceover at some point as if she’s repeating the parts that were meant for her friends.

If you wanted an insert of Spike he could be shown moving riding away from Sunnydale on his motorcycle while Dawn sees him off with tears and a hug. I’d love an excuse to see the “now leaving Sunnydale” sign once more in this finale. Buffy’s monologue could acknowledge the lesson he gave her: that forces of evil are not immovable structures- that love and family can also subjugate that which she previously thought could only be conquered with brute slayer force.

Once the monologue was finished with Dawn recounting Buffy’s last words (“be brave, live, for me” in Buffy’s voice for the last time, accompanied by a quick flashback of her smiling at Dawn , sunset in the background  on the tower) the flash afterwards that previously cut to her tombstone would cut to the exterior of the newly built Sunnydale High. Willow would be dropping Dawn off- it’s obvious it isn’t the first day through dialogue between them about the new high school being open for 6 months or something or about how Dawn is in high-school now and has a lab due or something. They’d talk about how Buffy would be proud of both of them and be slightly self congratulatory of maintaining the status quo against the forces of darkness without her.

After Dawn leaves Willow would be shown walking the campus in the rebuilt central courtyard taking it all in.

She notices an obviously unpopular girl sitting on the stairs by herself, reading, while passersby ridicule or sneer at her. She’s visibly upset but trying to appear as if she isn’t bothered and reading a book.

Willow approaches her and tells her she used to go there. The girl is guarded but says she heard a lot of stories of the old school. She’s still obviously distracted and upset but is being polite.

Willow comments on how difficult of a time she had in high school socially. She tells the girl that she reminds her of a lot of herself at that age. The girl seems slightly offended or put off- Willow is basically calling her a nerd but she goes back to reading her book, as if proving her point.

Willow says she had a hard time until she met a friend. The friend came to Sunnydale and changed this place for the better. She tells the girl that her friend was the strongest girl she ever met and that she also changed Willow. The girl nods, politely. Willow tells her that the girl on second thought reminds Willow more of her friend.

the girl looks up, interested but confused, awkwardly trying to laugh it off. Willow asks her if she ever wishes she was strong. Disarmed, and caught off guard the girl falters in concealing her hurt from before and nods meekly.

Willow smiles wistfully, knowingly, before asking pointedly “Are you ready to be?”

The last shot is of the girl considering for a second, although she seemed slightly on the verge of tears before. but then as she starts uncertainly nodding, almost in spite of herself, we see her break into a genuine determined smile for the first time. 



[My mindset for this does away with the slayer line being held through Faith and relies on the assumption that the scooby gang basically take over for or start working in tandem with the council after Buffy told them who was in charge in checkpoint. If you really wanted to drive this home you could have Willow going to work as the new school counsellor (putting her psych classes to use) with the implication of Willow being the new watcher. I’d also love the girl at the end to be a black girl or other underrepresented minority in the slayer canon]

Daycare #1: 1:6 ratio, I pack lunch but they provide snacks, $325 per week full time or I can do drop ins for shorter days for $15 an hour, Spanish “lessons”(Spanish is my first language so I only talk to my daughter in Spanish and my husband in English), they help build a community with the parents (they have an app where they try to do things on the weekends, invite to birthday parties etc). It’s 30 minutes away from my house, and I work from home so I’ll either have a 2 hour commute OR I’ll need to find a coffee shop or something to work from.

Daycare #2: 1:8 ratio, they provide lunch and snacks, $215 per week full time only, they’re brand new which does worry me a bit and the classroom is smaller and so is the outdoor space, they’re still hiring so I met a teacher but still not set in stone if that will be her teacher, it’s only 5 minutes from my house.

""not like i was invited last year"" (i went to play soccer ONCE and didn't invite him - as he had never invited me to many situations with his friends and i wanted to be able to spend time with my friends and not him stuck to my hip). we then talk about how we sat ""too close"" and he says that ""he isn't allowed to talk to any girls"" despite the fact i never denied him that. he brings this up as the one opportunity he had to make a girl friend was someone that was clearly a homewrecker (had a whole of, my bf gave her ONE ride and she then created an ig account after not having it for months, found him on ig, am'd him and asked what he was doing on his day off and constantly said ""i don't wanna drink alone:("" ""i don't wanna go for a walk alone:("" ). despite that, i simply asked him to set up boundaries with it being that that only speak about school related stuff and he was still welcome to drop her off at home, my boyfriend is a very kind and giving man who helps people constantly - this was not out of character. he then shifts the conversation to it being that
""everything we do is about me"" which came out of nowhere considering the conversation was about his issues with my best friend. he then says it's because i never plan anything for us. i work a part time job that gives me 15 hours, 20 on a good week, i make about 500$~ or so and i pay my mom 300 for rent + my 100$ phone bill and cat food that's another 100. the rest goes towards savings and credit card since my mom doesn't help me out AT ALL and i don't make much to spare. im a gift giving person and i always try to get him little things that i am able to afford. i understand i can try to plan free or low cost dates (more on this later) but its been winter the last 6 months and im not fond of going out when it's cold. i admitted i could have planned for us to go skating or something and that i was at fault for that. my retaliation was that HES that one that ends up planning everything and somehow its all about me. if he wanted to go for a hike, we could have gone since the weathers getting better. i've offered to go on walks and every time ** bring them up, he says no. he claims we spend all our time at the mall, despite us not going since march ONE time. i've offered to treat us to eat, i've offered to buy us legos so we can build them together. despite me not planning dates over winter, i've tried my hardest to plan quality time between us, that always gets denied. he was upset as well, that i went to the gym with my best friend (gym rat) yesterday after he came back from his vacation. i agreed simply because i've been stuck in a depressive state the last two weeks or so and my boyfriend said i should do things to make myself feel better, hence the gym. he was upset because he's been asking me for months to go with my best friend and just us two and i've said no (i don't like the gym AT ALL) ano yesterday i agreed and said the three of us should go (by bf also never goes to the gym). he was also upset as i went for a walk and coffee with a friend (again, for the depression) because i don't go with him. i've offered to play the card game We're Not Really Strangers for us to be closer, i've offered to work on our scrapbook together (to which he said i can do it by myself while he watches tv, so ""both of us can be happy""). all of this gets denied and rejected. i try to learn about his hobbies as he's a car guy, and suggest going to meets and takeovers so we can spend time doing something i thought he liked (apparently he hates it). he then says i still
""can't apologize"" and that im never gonna grow up, to which im once again confused because what am i apologizing for. he encouraged and told me to get out of bed and do things to feel better, which i did, and then is upset it just wasn't with him. it happens to be a pattern that when i don't feel mentally well? the relationship falls apart. he's been working 12 hour shifts, 7 days a week the last week or so and now it's ""nothing is typical about us anymore"". any time we get together is at 10 pm where we watch shameless and go to sleep.
i text him this morning about how literally the day before he told me how ""everything is fine and we're okay"" and then he proceeds to blow up in my face and how im somehow expected to trust him after that. this is a recurring pattern that he doesn't seem to believe, where he will pretend everything is fine (massive people pleaser) and then come to me saying how he's been miserable the last couple months. he's done this multiple times. his response to that is that he isn't going to talk to me until i apologize for how i reacted to him ""telling me how he felt"" and how i reacted.
i promise i tried to touch on everything he said and mentioned last night- im confused about what exactly im supposed to apologize for and if i even should. again, if im not 100% mentally well, our relationship goes to shit and anything having to do with my best friend is an issue every single time and i no longer know what to do about it. i know i can improve on planning free dates, especially as the weather gets warmer, we can go on his hikes and walks, but what am i apologizing for?

#Aeropress

GRIND - Grind as finely as you can without causing clumping in the grounds. Your grind should be finer than percolation/drip, but not quite as fine as espresso.

WATER - Always use fresh, clean, and soft water between 40-120ppm. Maintain a rolling boil throughout the brewing process.

RATIO - This basis of this recipe is a 1:17 ratio, but the water weight can be scaled up or down depending on your equipment and preferences. Always keep the coffee dose the same when adjusting ratios.

01 Bring your brew water to a boil (212F), place a paper filter into the Prismo cap, and screw onto the base of the Aeropress. Place the Aeropress on a decanter or sturdy mug.

02 Dose 15g of finely ground coffee into the brewers base, then tare your scale. Give the brewer a shake to ensure the bed is flat before brewing.

03 Start a timer and pour 255g of water in a steady, strong stream from a good height above the brewer. Once all the water has been added, place the plunger gently into the top of the Aeropress base to help retain heat.

04 When your timer reads 5:00, remove the plunger and using a spoon or the paddle that comes with the Aeropress, stir back and forth and side to side two times each, then return the plunger to its position, and slowly plunge. This should take roughly 30 seconds.

05 Enjoy your coffee! If it tastes sour, hollow, or metallic, grind finer. If it tastes drying, astringent, or harsh, grind coarser. If you are looking for more extraction complexity from your brew, try increasing the ratio to 1:18 by using 270g of water. If the flavor is too delicate and transparent, try 1:16 by using 240g of water.

#Pulsar

1:18 coffee to water ratio with a 18g dose.
Bloom with valve closed and without the dispersion lid with 100g water, agitate very gently to fully saturate coffee grounds and bloom for 1 minute.
Using the dispersion lid pour in the rest of the brew water and steep for 4 minutes with valve closed
At 5 total minutes ope the valve slightly so its not dripping but its just become a slow stream. Should be around 1 minute or 2 for a full draw down time.",3,1746726579.0,pourover,1,1.0,False
1khwfbv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1khwfbv,"Sri Lanka, 250 Million Years into the Past and the Future","[I hope I used right flair, this seemed more Coffee with Sri Lankans than General Discussion]

250 million years ago was the Triassic period, the supercontinent Pangea, which roughly existed upto the Jurassic (Image 1,2). I like how Sri Lanka was just sandwiched between Antarctica, Mozambique, Madagascar, and Kerala.

It's interesting to think that during this age of the dinosaurs, one would be able to walk from what at present are; Matara/Hambanthota/Galle to 'Norwegian' Antarctica, Kalutara/Colombo to Mozambique, Mannar/Kilinocci/Jaffna to Madagascar, and Batticaloa/Trincomalee to Kerala. I couldn't find anything about the fauna of SL in this period.. which is not cool.. there must've been all sorts of animals roaming around, but the very limited fossil records just have to offer ferns. Bruh. Also Triassic 'SL' was soo south of the equator, so must've experienced seasons too. Snow? I don't have sources.

There r 4 major models on the future continents 250 million years into the future. The most popular online, but seemingly the second most likely is the Pangea Proxima/Ultima (images 3,4,5,6). Now, if this does happen it would he cool because South Asia hasn't changed much at all.

If this model holds true, SL would be roughly the same island in this internal landlocked ocean for many millions of years 😯.. so unchanged and stable. With squeezing the Palk Straight might dissapear, making SL continous with India, but overall.. that's still very unchanged from everything else going around. Rlly cool.

I wasn't sure what flair to have used, so I didn't use one, since it was optional.

At first glance, the documentation made it seem like I’d need a separate AutoRag instance for each site-a potentially messy and resource-intensive approach.

However, after a bit of research, I discovered that Cloudflare AutoRag supports metadata filtering. This is a game-changer! It means you can store data from multiple sources in a single AutoRag instance and filter your queries by metadata, such as the source website or directory.

Here’s a sample code snippet that demonstrates how you can filter your search by folder and timestamp.

With this approach, you can specify the R2 directory (or any custom metadata key), allowing you to keep all your website data in one place and simply filter as needed. This makes scaling and managing multi-site chatbots much more efficient.



Key takeaway:No need for multiple AutoRag instances-just leverage metadata filters to organize and query your data!

1khwcs3,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1khwcs3/i_caught_my_landlord_rummaging_through_my/,I caught my landlord rummaging through my belongings. What are my tenant rights?,"Location: Boca Raton, FL

Last Friday, my landlord warned me that the AC tech would be coming into my room on Monday to access the attic, which contains the air conditioner. Normally, I leave my room to give the AC tech space, but this time, I stayed in my bathroom and locked the door. This bathroom is solely mine. I rent a room in a house. There is no written lease and we do 3-month lump sum payments. 

At 10 a.m. on Monday, I heard the landlord and AC tech enter my bedroom. The AC tech went into the attic. Through the bathroom door, I heard a can open in my room. I was confused because I only have coffee cans, but I didn’t think my landlord would dare drink my items.

Minutes later, I noticed my landlord was messing with my locked bathroom doorknob, trying to turn it and force the door open with no success. He left and came back a few minutes later. I heard metal keys and my landlord trying different keys in the doorknob, pushing harder. At this point, I was trembling because he was not supposed to be rummaging through my rooms.

I didn’t say anything because I had a laser treatment done on my face and didn’t want anyone to see me with a wounded face.

After failing to get into the bathroom, I heard a loud, long zipper noise. It was from my large tote bag, which I keep near my entrance on a clothing rack. This is my only purse and the only zipped item in my room other than clothes. My heart sank. He was going through my purse. Thankfully, I had taken all my important items, like my phone, wallet, and computer, into the locked bathroom.

I knew I had to confront him or he would continue violating my belongings. I opened the bathroom door, and he was rummaging through a basket I keep with plastic bags on top of a storage box. I later realized that under the basket is where I keep my undergarments. If he had snooped before, he would have known that.

When I opened the door, I was almost in tears, telling him to stop going through my things. He angrily said, “What are you doing in there?” I repeated for him to stop. He left the room.

He came back a few minutes later and started a diversion conversation about a garbage bag I used to cover a large crack in the ceiling. The crack had been there from day one, and I covered it for my safety. He acted as if he had never seen it before since 2022 and took a photo of it. During that conversation, I was sitting on my bed with a medical face mask due to the laser treatment and a baseball hat. I realized I couldn’t trust him with my belongings. I was having a panic attack and didn’t say anything.

He left and came back minutes later, saying his ex-wife was missing for the second time. Months ago, his ex-wife had gone missing, and to be nice, I had offered advice to help. After that, he asked me out to dinner. I politely declined by saying I would be out of town. I think he brought it up again to create another diversion. I simply said okay and closed the door. By that point, the AC tech had finished their job.

Twenty minutes later, the landlord texted me saying he was looking for a pen and paper to get the AC information and that’s why he was in my belongings. This was clearly a lie to protect himself legally. I didn’t respond. He then sent texts asking me to contact the place where I volunteer to tell them his ex-wife was missing. I ignored the text.

I haven’t filed a police report because I’m healing from the laser treatment, and talking to the police is naturally stressful for me. I had an experience before where I reached out for help, and the officer began interrogating me. I also don’t have a backup plan if they were to arrest my landlord, and I don’t have any local friends to help me.

We do a 3-month lump sum payment. I’ve prepaid until July 1st. He texted me before this violation, asking for the July, August, and September lump sum early, to be paid by May 14th, because he needs to pay the actual owner of the house and might not make the full payment. This adds pressure on me to pay early. I only recently learned he’s not the owner of the house, which was unsettling. The owner sold the house and I have to move Oct 1st.

Now, I feel incredibly uneasy at the thought of continuing to live here and paying the lump sum rent early. I bought a Ring camera and plan to put a Ring camera security sticker on my door and windows to warn him.

How soon can I leave without risking legal issues as a tenant? Do I have to pay the early pre-paid rent lump sum when I am prepaid till July 1st?",0,1746726409.0,legaladvice,0,0.5,False

# Colombo

The “capital” of broken dreams and broken suspensions. People pay 200k a month to live in a matchbox apartment next to a drainage canal and call it “central.” The roads? An open-world video game — random NPCs, wild animals, pop-up potholes. Traffic lights are just decorative. You don’t drive in Colombo; you survive. Rent’s so high you’re basically financing a three-wheeler to live next to a guy burning plastic.

# Kandy

The hill capital, where roads are allergic to being straight. A 2km trip has 12 hairpin turns, 3 ceremonies, 8 tuk stops, and a monkey protest in the middle. Say Colombo is better, and you'll trigger a civil war. You came for the Temple of the Tooth and stayed because the roundabout wouldn’t let you leave.

# Galle

Where people cosplay as Europeans because there’s a lighthouse and a wall. The fort is just a colonial Instagram set. Locals trying to buy dal have to dodge yoga influencers doing backbends for 47 followers. A coconut here costs more than a Lion Lager, and everyone’s surprised when it rains… during monsoon.

# Jaffna

Post-war? Yes. Progress? Not if bureaucracy has a say. Time paused in 2009 and forgot to press play. Incredible food — if you can find it open. Shops are either closed, ""opening soon,"" or “out of stock.” Jaffna runs on palmyra, pride, and one surviving bicycle repair shop.

# Nuwara Eliya

A British fantasy stuck in a tropical glitch. Locals wear parkas in 16°C like they’re summiting Everest. You come for tea and views, end up in traffic caused by a tractor parade and three cows arguing. Those “charming colonial buildings”? Smell like damp sweaters and broken dreams.

# Trincomalee

Gorgeous beaches. Turquoise water. Zero urgency. You’ll spend half your trip explaining your *actual* reservation, and the other half trying to get Wi-Fi. It’s paradise, just stuck in 2013. Come now, before they discover fiber optics.

# Negombo

The city where logic goes to die. It’s the first thing tourists see: overpriced seafood, broken pavement, and mystery beach smells. Everyone’s either going to the airport or recovering from it. The lagoon? A climate change documentary in progress.

# Anuradhapura

Sacred, ancient… and 80% cows. They own the roads and maybe even some deeds. Your hotel room? A time capsule from 1992 — with bonus cockroaches. You don’t visit Anuradhapura for comfort; you come to find God barefoot in the sun.

# Polonnaruwa

Anuradhapura’s artsy cousin who did a semester abroad. More ruins, fewer signs, and five guys pretending to be tour guides. The monkeys run the city council. Expect heatstroke, fake antiques, and unsolicited history lessons from barefoot hustlers.

# Batticaloa

If “something might happen here someday” was a city. It’s calm. Like, **eerie** calm. Even ghosts are like “nah, I’m bored.” There’s a fish that sings. Sadly, not about infrastructure. Gorgeous beaches — perfect if you enjoy being alone with your thoughts (and regret).

# Matara

Matara: “We’re not Galle, but we try.” The entire city runs on caffeine and confusion. Buses play chicken, dogs play god, and tuk-tuk uncles give unsolicited life advice at 2 AM. A coastal fever dream — Red Bull, sea spray, and existential chaos.

# Kurunegala

There’s a rock. That’s it. That’s the tweet. (Okay fine, it’s a big rock.)

# Ratnapura

Want gems? Better like mud, leeches, and mild trench foot. It rains like the sky has trauma. Half the town is digging holes, the other half is fighting over who found a sapphire first. You don’t just leave Ratnapura — you *escape* it, soggy and slightly wiser.

# Sri Lanka

If Sri Lanka was a dysfunctional family, these cities are the loud, chaotic cousins who ruin weddings but make the best stories.

# Want me to roast the Colombo suburbs next?

I’ve got ammo, and I’m not afraid to use it.

EDIT:

I asked it again to roast the people, heres what i got:

""Colombo people will spend Rs. 20,000 on sushi and then haggle Rs. 10 with the tuk guy like it’s a UN peace treaty.
They say “Bro we should catch up” with no intention of catching up. Ever.
They go to coffee shops with laptops just to open a Google Doc and stare at it for 2 hours — pure Colombo hustle.

Ah, the suburbs — where every area sounds like a fake real estate scam.
“Come live in Thalawathugoda Heights, Rs. 45 million for a two-bedroom dungeon with guaranteed flooding.”
Or Battaramulla, where the only “developed” thing is the level of passive-aggressive aunty gossip.

The food? Legendary. But you’ll have to mortgage a kidney for a plate of kottu in a place with dim lighting and one plastic chair.
Rs. 2,000 for fried rice. But no water, no napkins, and the waiter acts like he’s doing you a favor.

Everyone in Colombo is broke but also somehow drives a BMW with a wedding garland still on it.
You’ll meet a 25-year-old “freelancer” with 2 iPhones, zero savings, and an unexplained Dubai trip every three months.
Meanwhile, middle-class parents are surviving off Milo and disappointment just to keep the family in a zip code with “Colombo” in the address.

My Struggle with Gut Issues  
  
For years, I struggled with digestive issues—constant bloating, irregular digestion, and an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach after every meal. It wasn’t just physical discomfort; the ongoing issues also left me feeling sluggish, moody, and mentally foggy. I tried everything: diet changes, exercise, various over-the-counter supplements, and even prescribed medications, but nothing seemed to truly solve the problem.  
My energy levels were often low, and I could never shake the feeling of heaviness after eating. It wasn’t until I started feeling more discomfort, including occasional cramps, that I realized I needed a solution that went deeper than just masking symptoms. I wanted something that could actually help restore my gut health and overall vitality. That’s when I discovered PrimeBiome.  
  
First Impressions: What Makes PrimeBiome Different?  
  
PrimeBiome immediately stood out to me for a few reasons. First, the ingredients list caught my eye. The product is packed with multiple strains of probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes. These elements are crucial for gut health because they not only replenish the beneficial bacteria in your gut but also support the process of digestion and absorption of nutrients.  
  
What I particularly loved about PrimeBiome was its high-quality formula. It’s not just another generic probiotic with one or two strains. Instead, PrimeBiome combines 10 powerful strains that have been scientifically proven to support digestion, boost immunity, and balance gut flora. The product is also free from artificial additives and preservatives, which is a huge bonus for me since I prefer supplements that are as natural as possible.  
Week 1: Noticeable Improvements in Digestion  
  
I started taking PrimeBiome with a sense of cautious optimism. The first week was more about giving my body time to adjust to the new supplement. Initially, I didn’t experience a drastic change, but I did notice a slight reduction in bloating. I didn’t feel as heavy after meals, and that persistent fullness was beginning to fade.  
The biggest thing I noticed during the first week was how consistent my digestion became. In the past, I would often feel discomfort or bloating after eating certain foods, but I was surprised to find that I wasn’t experiencing those issues nearly as often. For the first time in a long while, my stomach felt calmer, and I wasn’t dealing with the usual digestive disruptions.  
  
Week 2: Energy Boost and Mental Clarity  
By the end of week two, I was starting to feel much more energized. In fact, I was waking up feeling more refreshed than I had in months. I typically struggled with low energy in the mornings and would rely heavily on coffee to get through the day, but after two weeks of taking PrimeBiome, I found that I wasn’t needing my usual caffeine fix.  
  
On top of the physical changes, I also noticed my mental clarity improving. It’s incredible how much your gut health affects your brain function. I no longer felt foggy or sluggish during the day, and I was able to focus better at work and in conversations. It was like a mental reset.  
One thing I’ve learned is that gut health doesn’t just impact digestion—it has a profound effect on your mood and mental wellness. PrimeBiome helped me experience this shift, and I could feel my mood lifting as my gut health improved. It was a relief to finally feel “normal” again, with consistent energy and no more digestive problems hanging over my head.  
  
  
Week 3: Bloating and Discomfort Are Gone  
  
By week three, I could confidently say that PrimeBiome had changed my life. The bloating and discomfort I had dealt with for years were gone, and I could eat without fear of feeling bloated or heavy afterward. Whether it was a salad, a protein-packed meal, or a more indulgent dish, my digestive system was handling it all effortlessly.  
  
What really stood out to me was how natural the results felt. There was no quick fix or drastic change, just a steady, consistent improvement. Over time, my gut microbiome was becoming balanced, and I could tell because I was feeling lighter, more energetic, and more in tune with my body.  
I wasn’t expecting such a comprehensive transformation, but I realized that PrimeBiome wasn’t just addressing one symptom—it was providing holistic gut support, from digestion to immunity to overall well-being.  
  
  
  
  
Why PrimeBiome Is Different: The Science Behind It  
  
So what makes PrimeBiome so effective? It’s all about the powerful ingredients and scientific formulation. PrimeBiome contains 10 carefully chosen probiotic strains, each selected for their ability to support various aspects of gut health. Some of the standout strains include:  
Lactobacillus acidophilus: Helps to balance the gut microbiome and improve digestion.  
Bifidobacterium longum: Known for its ability to support digestive regularity and promote a healthy gut lining.  
Saccharomyces boulardii: A beneficial yeast that helps reduce bloating and support immune function.  
Additionally, PrimeBiome includes prebiotics, which are non-digestible fibers that feed beneficial gut bacteria, and digestive enzymes to aid in food breakdown and nutrient absorption. The combination of these elements makes PrimeBiome a comprehensive and potent solution for digestive and gut health.  
  
No More Guesswork—PrimeBiome Does the Work for You  
  
What truly sets PrimeBiome apart is its holistic approach to gut health. Many supplements only target one aspect of digestion, but PrimeBiome covers all the bases—probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes work together to restore balance in the gut, improve digestion, and even enhance your immune system.  
Unlike many other probiotic supplements that only contain one or two strains of bacteria, PrimeBiome is designed to give your body everything it needs to optimize gut function. Whether you’re dealing with bloating, irregular digestion, or low energy, PrimeBiome tackles the root cause by supporting your body’s natural processes.  
  
  
The Final Verdict: You Need to Try PrimeBiome  
  
If you’ve been struggling with gut health, digestive issues, or low energy, PrimeBiome is an absolute game-changer. It’s not a quick fix—it’s a comprehensive solution that will leave you feeling healthier, more energized, and more comfortable in your body.  
I’ve tried countless other products over the years, but none have come close to the results I’ve seen with PrimeBiome. If you’re looking for something that actually works, with scientifically-backed ingredients and long-lasting results, this is the product for you.  
Don’t wait any longer to experience the transformation PrimeBiome can offer. Your gut, your energy, and your life will thank you.

For the first time in a long while, my stomach felt calmer, and I wasn’t dealing with the usual digestive disruptions.  
  
Week 2: Energy Boost and Mental Clarity  
  
By the end of week two, I was starting to feel much more energized. In fact, I was waking up feeling more refreshed than I had in months. I typically struggled with low energy in the mornings and would rely heavily on coffee to get through the day, but after two weeks of taking PrimeBiome, I found that I wasn’t needing my usual caffeine fix.  
  
On top of the physical changes, I also noticed my mental clarity improving. It’s incredible how much your gut health affects your brain function. I no longer felt foggy or sluggish during the day, and I was able to focus better at work and in conversations. It was like a mental reset.  
  
One thing I’ve learned is that gut health doesn’t just impact digestion—it has a profound effect on your mood and mental wellness. PrimeBiome helped me experience this shift, and I could feel my mood lifting as my gut health improved. It was a relief to finally feel “normal” again, with consistent energy and no more digestive problems hanging over my head.  
  
Week 3: Bloating and Discomfort Are Gone  
  
By week three, I could confidently say that PrimeBiome had changed my life. The bloating and discomfort I had dealt with for years were gone, and I could eat without fear of feeling bloated or heavy afterward. Whether it was a salad, a protein-packed meal, or a more indulgent dish, my digestive system was handling it all effortlessly.  
  
What really stood out to me was how natural the results felt. There was no quick fix or drastic change, just a steady, consistent improvement. Over time, my gut microbiome was becoming balanced, and I could tell because I was feeling lighter, more energetic, and more in tune with my body.  
  
I wasn’t expecting such a comprehensive transformation, but I realized that PrimeBiome wasn’t just addressing one symptom—it was providing holistic gut support, from digestion to immunity to overall well-being.  
  
Why PrimeBiome Is Different: The Science Behind It  
  
So what makes PrimeBiome so effective? It’s all about the powerful ingredients and scientific formulation. PrimeBiome contains 10 carefully chosen probiotic strains, each selected for their ability to support various aspects of gut health. Some of the standout strains include:  
  
Lactobacillus acidophilus: Helps to balance the gut microbiome and improve digestion.  
  
Bifidobacterium longum: Known for its ability to support digestive regularity and promote a healthy gut lining.  
  
Saccharomyces boulardii: A beneficial yeast that helps reduce bloating and support immune function.  
  
Additionally, PrimeBiome includes prebiotics, which are non-digestible fibers that feed beneficial gut bacteria, and digestive enzymes to aid in food breakdown and nutrient absorption. The combination of these elements makes PrimeBiome a comprehensive and potent solution for digestive and gut health.  
  
No More Guesswork—PrimeBiome Does the Work for You  
  
What truly sets PrimeBiome apart is its holistic approach to gut health. Many supplements only target one aspect of digestion, but PrimeBiome covers all the bases—probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes work together to restore balance in the gut, improve digestion, and even enhance your immune system.  
  
Unlike many other probiotic supplements that only contain one or two strains of bacteria, PrimeBiome is designed to give your body everything it needs to optimize gut function. Whether you’re dealing with bloating, irregular digestion, or low energy, PrimeBiome tackles the root cause by supporting your body’s natural processes.

My Struggle with Gut Issues  
  
For years, I struggled with digestive issues—constant bloating, irregular digestion, and an uncomfortable feeling in my stomach after every meal. It wasn’t just physical discomfort; the ongoing issues also left me feeling sluggish, moody, and mentally foggy. I tried everything: diet changes, exercise, various over-the-counter supplements, and even prescribed medications, but nothing seemed to truly solve the problem.  
  
My energy levels were often low, and I could never shake the feeling of heaviness after eating. It wasn’t until I started feeling more discomfort, including occasional cramps, that I realized I needed a solution that went deeper than just masking symptoms. I wanted something that could actually help restore my gut health and overall vitality. That’s when I discovered PrimeBiome.  
  
First Impressions: What Makes PrimeBiome Different?  
  
PrimeBiome immediately stood out to me for a few reasons. First, the ingredients list caught my eye. The product is packed with multiple strains of probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes. These elements are crucial for gut health because they not only replenish the beneficial bacteria in your gut but also support the process of digestion and absorption of nutrients.  
  
What I particularly loved about PrimeBiome was its high-quality formula. It’s not just another generic probiotic with one or two strains. Instead, PrimeBiome combines 10 powerful strains that have been scientifically proven to support digestion, boost immunity, and balance gut flora. The product is also free from artificial additives and preservatives, which is a huge bonus for me since I prefer supplements that are as natural as possible.  
  
Week 1: Noticeable Improvements in Digestion  
  
I started taking PrimeBiome with a sense of cautious optimism. The first week was more about giving my body time to adjust to the new supplement. Initially, I didn’t experience a drastic change, but I did notice a slight reduction in bloating. I didn’t feel as heavy after meals, and that persistent fullness was beginning to fade.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love you mother

But you are blinded too easily.

Why does the cub

Have to save the 

Mama Bear?

/

When stepdad was drinking

Wine bottles 

Whole,

He saw himself on the porch of a farmhouse,

Drinking freshly brewed coffee

Made with beans from 

Arabica trees.

/

When that man 

Slashed your tires,

He imagined himself in a field,

Harvesting grains and vegetables

With a light weighted and sharp sickle.

/

When he kicked our door in,

He felt as if he was in a barn,

Kicking the feed bag over

For the livestock to satisfy their hunger.

/

Maybe,

You began seeing that too.

/

You grew comfortable in that inferno.

You were ignorant of his ill-will.

You forced me to mature,

And pick the lock to the jail cell he had locked us in,

That you had the key to.

/

I refused to submit,

And let us starve and stagnate in that pit

While he was pissing on us.

So I put a target on my back.

I forced the government to give chase,

And led them to our Alcatraz.

/

Prosperity endorses those who dare.

I am a visionary,

And a first-mover.

We would have died if not for me.

Maybe physically,

But certainly spiritually.

/

I love you mother,

But that shouldn’t have been me.

You are still in a deep hole of debt,

And once again

The cub

Will have to save

His Mama Bear.",1,1746726134.0,poetry_critics,0,1.0,False

When I first heard about MITOLYN, I was skeptical — like most people. A lot of supplements promise the world but deliver disappointment. But what happened after I actually tried MITOLYN? Let’s just say: my body, energy, and life haven't been the same since. In this honest 2025 review, I’m going to share my complete personal experience, what I liked, what could be better, and most importantly — why I believe MITOLYN is worth every penny.  
  
**Get the best deals and authentic products when you Buy Now From the Official Website.**  
  
Why I Started Using MITOLYN  
  
At 42, I felt older than I should.  
  
I was tired all the time.  
  
My focus was fading.  
  
My joints ached.  
  
I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.  
  
And worst of all, I was starting to lose my confidence.  
  
Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted real answers and a real solution.  
  
That’s when I discovered MITOLYN – a supplement designed to restore mitochondrial health (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.  
  
What is MITOLYN?  
  
MITOLYN is a science-backed, mitochondria-targeted health supplement. Its goal? To recharge your cells by improving mitochondrial function — which influences energy, metabolism, mental clarity, muscle performance, and even longevity.  
  
Key benefits they promise:  
  
Boost energy naturally  
  
Improve focus and brain performance  
  
Support healthy weight management  
  
Reduce joint pain and inflammation  
  
Fight cellular aging  
  
To be honest, it felt like a too-good-to-be-true checklist. But I gave it a shot.  
  
What’s Inside MITOLYN? (And Why It Matters)  
  
What made MITOLYN stand out for me was the premium, research-backed ingredients that target real cellular health — not just superficial energy boosts like caffeine.  
  
Some of the star ingredients include:  
  
CoQ10 – Supports cellular energy and heart health  
  
PQQ – Promotes the growth of new mitochondria  
  
Acetyl-L-Carnitine – Improves mental clarity and memory  
  
Alpha Lipoic Acid – Fights oxidative stress  
  
Resveratrol – Powerful antioxidant with anti-aging properties  
  
Magnesium, Zinc, Vitamin B12 – Essential for energy production  
  
Together, these ingredients form a synergistic formula that targets the root cause of fatigue and aging — mitochondrial decline.

✅ My 30-Day MITOLYN Experience: What Changed?  
  
I took MITOLYN exactly as instructed — 2 capsules every morning with water. Here's what happened week by week:  
  
✅ Week 1:  
  
Slight increase in morning energy  
  
Clearer mental focus during work  
  
No crash in the afternoon like before  
  
✅ Week 2:  
  
Woke up before my alarm — feeling refreshed  
  
Digestion felt smoother  
  
Less brain fog  
  
I started to feel “lighter”  
  
✅ Week 3:  
  
My energy levels felt stable and strong all day  
  
I could focus better at work for longer periods  
  
My workouts improved — less joint pain  
  
I noticed a mood boost too — more optimistic  
  
✅ Week 4:  
  
I felt like I got my younger self back  
  
I stopped reaching for coffee  
  
My weight dropped by 3 pounds  
  
I felt clear-headed, more active, and even happier  
  
Real Benefits I Noticed with MITOLYN  
  
After one month, here’s what changed drastically:  
  
Energy: I went from drained to dynamic. No coffee needed.  
  
Focus: Mental clarity and attention improved big time.  
  
Metabolism: My body felt more active. I started burning fat faster.  
  
Recovery: Faster post-gym recovery and less soreness.  
  
Joint Relief: Pain in my knees and wrists almost disappeared.  
  
Overall Mood: I feel mentally sharper and emotionally lighter.  
  
MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know  
  
No review is honest without mentioning the downsides — and yes, MITOLYN has a few:  
  


1. Not Instant

You won’t feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn’t a “quick fix” — it’s a science-backed long-term upgrade.  
  
2. Premium Price  
  
It’s not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact — it’s worth the investment.  
  
3. Limited Stock  
  
  
  
**Get the best deals and authentic products when you Buy Now From the Official Website.**  
  
This actually frustrated me: MITOLYN sells out often. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 2–3 bottles upfront.  
  
Is MITOLYN Worth It in 2025?  
  
Absolutely, yes.  
  
If you’re:  
  
Feeling constantly tired  
  
Struggling with brain fog or poor memory  
  
Battling joint pain  
  
Gaining unwanted weight  
  
Or just feel like you're “aging too fast”  
  
Then MITOLYN can literally be the missing piece in your daily routine.  
  
Unlike cheap energy boosters, MITOLYN works deep inside your cells to fix what’s broken. That’s why the results are real and lasting.  
  
Final Verdict: Should You Buy MITOLYN?  
  
MITOLYN is not a gimmick.  
  
It’s a premium, advanced mitochondria support supplement that delivers real results. I’ve tried dozens of products over the years — but nothing has made me feel this recharged, balanced, and confident.  
  
If you’re serious about taking control of your health in 2025 — MITOLYN is the #1 product I recommend. Period.  
  
Where to Buy MITOLYN?

MITOLYN Complaints: What You Should Know  
  
No review is honest without mentioning the downsides — and yes, MITOLYN has a few:  
  


1. Not Instant

You won’t feel anything miraculous on day 1. This isn’t a “quick fix” — it’s a science-backed long-term upgrade.  
  
2. Premium Price  
  
It’s not the cheapest supplement, especially if you compare it to generic multivitamins. But when you look at the ingredients, the research, and the real impact — it’s worth the investment.  
  
3. Limited Stock  
  
  
  
**Get the best deals and authentic products when you Buy Now From the Official Website.**  
  
This actually frustrated me: MITOLYN sells out often. I tried to reorder in week 4 and had to wait 7 days. If you're buying, I recommend getting 2–3 bottles upfront.  
  
Is MITOLYN Worth It in 2025?  
  
Absolutely, yes.  
  
If you’re:  
  
Feeling constantly tired  
  
Struggling with brain fog or poor memory  
  
Battling joint pain  
  
Gaining unwanted weight  
  
Or just feel like you're “aging too fast”  
  
Then MITOLYN can literally be the missing piece in your daily routine.  
  
Unlike cheap energy boosters, MITOLYN works deep inside your cells to fix what’s broken. That’s why the results are real and lasting.  
  
Final Verdict: Should You Buy MITOLYN?  
  
MITOLYN is not a gimmick.  
  
It’s a premium, advanced mitochondria support supplement that delivers real results. I’ve tried dozens of products over the years — but nothing has made me feel this recharged, balanced, and confident.  
  
If you’re serious about taking control of your health in 2025 — MITOLYN is the #1 product I recommend. Period.

Why I Started Using MITOLYN  
  
At 42, I felt older than I should.  
  
I was tired all the time.  
  
My focus was fading.  
  
My joints ached.  
  
I was gaining weight, even with moderate eating.  
  
And worst of all, I was starting to lose my confidence.  
  
Doctors told me it was just “aging” or “stress.” I wasn’t buying it. I wanted real answers and a real solution.  
  
That’s when I discovered MITOLYN – a supplement designed to restore mitochondrial health (the energy factories inside your cells) and help fight fatigue, inflammation, and aging at the cellular level.

Boost energy naturally  
  
Improve focus and brain performance  
  
Support healthy weight management  
  
Reduce joint pain and inflammation

To be honest, it felt like a too-good-to-be-true checklist. But I gave it a shot.

# I Was Exhausted, Mentally and Physically – Until MITOLYN​

Before I found MITOLYN, my life felt like it was slipping through my fingers. I’m a 42-year-old professional with a family, a career, and what should be a vibrant life. But I felt **tired all the time**. No matter how much I slept, I woke up feeling like I hadn’t rested at all. I couldn’t focus at work. My motivation was gone. My workouts felt pointless. Even spending time with my kids became a struggle.  
Doctors told me everything looked ""normal"" in my labs. But I knew something was wrong.  
Then, late one night while searching for answers online, I stumbled upon **MITOLYN** – a supplement designed to **revitalize mitochondrial function**, the powerhouse of every cell in your body. I was skeptical. I’ve tried dozens of supplements over the years, and nothing ever made a difference. But something about MITOLYN was different.  
  
What caught my attention was **scientific backing**. The creators of MITOLYN aren’t just marketers – they’re experts in cellular health and anti-aging science. The formula includes powerful ingredients like **Urolithin A, NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), PQQ, CoQ10, and Resveratrol**, all clinically studied to improve mitochondrial health, reduce inflammation, and restore cellular energy.  
I figured I had nothing to lose… so I ordered my first bottle.  
  


# The First 7 Days – Noticeable Energy Shift​

By day three, I noticed I was waking up feeling just a little bit *lighter*. My brain fog began to lift. I wasn’t chugging 3 cups of coffee by noon anymore.  
By day seven, the difference was **impossible to ignore**. I had energy. Not the jittery kind you get from energy drinks – this was real, steady, sustainable energy. I felt **alive** in a way I hadn’t felt in years.  
My productivity at work soared. I even started jogging again, something I hadn’t done in months. MITOLYN didn’t just give me energy – it gave me **hope**.  


# By Week 4 – I Got My Life Back​

I can’t overstate this: MITOLYN gave me **my life back**. After 30 days, I felt **10 years younger**. I was waking up refreshed. My mental clarity was razor sharp. My skin looked healthier. My digestion improved. My mood lifted.  
The chronic inflammation and “drag” that had haunted me for years seemed to **melt away**.  
Even my wife noticed the changes – not just in my energy, but in my confidence, my happiness, my presence as a father and partner.  
  


# Why MITOLYN Works When Other Supplements Fail​

What sets MITOLYN apart isn’t just its ingredient list – it’s the **synergistic formula** and **absorption technology**. Many supplements throw together popular buzzwords but don’t deliver results. MITOLYN uses **bioavailable forms** of each compound, meaning your body actually absorbs and uses the nutrients.  
Each capsule is packed with potent, clean, and clinically researched ingredients that:  
✅ **Boost mitochondrial regeneration**  
✅ **Support ATP (energy) production**  
✅ **Reduce oxidative stress and cellular aging**  
✅ **Improve brain function and memory**  
✅ **Enhance cardiovascular and metabolic health**  
This is not a gimmick. It’s not a temporary caffeine fix. MITOLYN works **from the cellular level up** – addressing the **root cause** of fatigue, brain fog, and early aging.  


# Real People, Real Results – I’m Not Alone​

After joining a MITOLYN Facebook support group, I realized something powerful: **thousands of people were experiencing the same transformation**. From tired moms to aging professionals to fitness enthusiasts – MITOLYN was restoring lives everywhere.  
I read stories of people recovering from burnout, reversing age-related decline, and feeling youthful again – all thanks to this one product. That gave me even more confidence that MITOLYN isn’t just hype – it’s the **real deal**.  


# Safe, Natural, and Backed by Science​

Another reason I trust MITOLYN is its **purity and transparency**. It’s manufactured in an **FDA-registered**, **GMP-certified facility** in the USA, with **no artificial fillers, no gluten, and no GMOs**. You can actually scan the barcode and see the lab results.  
And they offer a **100% satisfaction guarantee**. That means if you don’t feel a dramatic improvement in your energy and focus, you can get your money back. No hassle.  
But trust me: you won’t be asking for a refund.  


# Who Should Use MITOLYN?​

If you:  


* Feel tired even after a full night’s sleep
* Struggle with focus, memory, or motivation
* Experience chronic stress or mental burnout
* Want to slow down aging from the inside out
* Are dealing with inflammation, weight gain, or metabolic issues
* Want to support your heart, brain, and cellular health long-term
*   Then **MITOLYN is for you**. 

# Final Verdict – Buy It Now Before It Sells Out​

MITOLYN is not just another supplement – it’s a **life-changer**. I’ve already stocked up on 6 bottles because I never want to go back to feeling like I used to.  
I’m not exaggerating when I say this: **MITOLYN should be in every medicine cabinet**. It’s the closest thing to a “cellular reset” I’ve ever experienced. It gave me back my energy, my focus, and my joy. And it might just do the same for you.  
Don’t waste years searching for solutions that don’t work. **Start with the one that does.** MITOLYN is in high demand, and it sells out fast – so if it’s in stock right now, grab it.  
You owe it to yourself – and your future – to try MITOLYN.  
  
  
**Update: 3 Months Later – Still Going Strong!**  
I’ve now been taking MITOLYN for over 3 months, and the benefits have only compounded. I’ve lost 12 pounds without even trying. My blood pressure is better. My mood is stable. And I genuinely look forward to each day with purpose and energy.  
MITOLYN didn’t just restore my health. It restored my **freedom**.  
If you're still on the fence, I get it. But just try one bottle. Just one. You’ll feel the shift – and you’ll never look back.",1,1746726097.0,RobloxKaijuParadise,1,1.0,False

# I Was Exhausted, Mentally and Physically – Until MITOLYN​

Before I found MITOLYN, my life felt like it was slipping through my fingers. I’m a 42-year-old professional with a family, a career, and what should be a vibrant life. But I felt **tired all the time**. No matter how much I slept, I woke up feeling like I hadn’t rested at all. I couldn’t focus at work. My motivation was gone. My workouts felt pointless. Even spending time with my kids became a struggle.  
Doctors told me everything looked ""normal"" in my labs. But I knew something was wrong.  
Then, late one night while searching for answers online, I stumbled upon **MITOLYN** – a supplement designed to **revitalize mitochondrial function**, the powerhouse of every cell in your body. I was skeptical. I’ve tried dozens of supplements over the years, and nothing ever made a difference. But something about MITOLYN was different.  
  
What caught my attention was **scientific backing**. The creators of MITOLYN aren’t just marketers – they’re experts in cellular health and anti-aging science. The formula includes powerful ingredients like **Urolithin A, NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide), PQQ, CoQ10, and Resveratrol**, all clinically studied to improve mitochondrial health, reduce inflammation, and restore cellular energy.  
I figured I had nothing to lose… so I ordered my first bottle.  
  


# The First 7 Days – Noticeable Energy Shift​

By day three, I noticed I was waking up feeling just a little bit *lighter*. My brain fog began to lift. I wasn’t chugging 3 cups of coffee by noon anymore.  
By day seven, the difference was **impossible to ignore**. I had energy. Not the jittery kind you get from energy drinks – this was real, steady, sustainable energy. I felt **alive** in a way I hadn’t felt in years.  
My productivity at work soared. I even started jogging again, something I hadn’t done in months. MITOLYN didn’t just give me energy – it gave me **hope**.  


# By Week 4 – I Got My Life Back​

I can’t overstate this: MITOLYN gave me **my life back**. After 30 days, I felt **10 years younger**. I was waking up refreshed. My mental clarity was razor sharp. My skin looked healthier. My digestion improved. My mood lifted.  
The chronic inflammation and “drag” that had haunted me for years seemed to **melt away**.  
Even my wife noticed the changes – not just in my energy, but in my confidence, my happiness, my presence as a father and partner.  
  


# Why MITOLYN Works When Other Supplements Fail​

What sets MITOLYN apart isn’t just its ingredient list – it’s the **synergistic formula** and **absorption technology**. Many supplements throw together popular buzzwords but don’t deliver results. MITOLYN uses **bioavailable forms** of each compound, meaning your body actually absorbs and uses the nutrients.  
Each capsule is packed with potent, clean, and clinically researched ingredients that:  
✅ **Boost mitochondrial regeneration**  
✅ **Support ATP (energy) production**  
✅ **Reduce oxidative stress and cellular aging**  
✅ **Improve brain function and memory**  
✅ **Enhance cardiovascular and metabolic health**

1khw421,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1khw421/trying_to_understand_why_my_mother_died/,Trying to understand why my mother died,"My adored, one-of-a-kind mother has died suddenly. The autopsy is inconclusive. I have been to see her doctor and he can't really enlighten me. I think she died of a cardiac arrhythmia, but I would like if possible to get some opinions here (have already gotten some elsewhere but a couple extra can't hurt). Please note that we live in France, so the medical system is a bit different.

My mother was 76, fit, robust, physically and mentally energetic and active, no known health problems...except for one thing.

In May 2021, she fainted at home after feeling nauseated, and although I told her not to go out after that until she'd seen a doctor, she did, and the next afternoon fainted while sitting in her chair in a cafe. She was taken to the emergency room and checked out, including an EKG and blood tests, and turned loose as no problems were found. She saw her general practitioner after this and he showed her some counterpressure manoeuvres to use if she felt faint.

In August 2021 she had what she described as 'a minor faint' while waiting to catch a train. She seemed to find the whole thing rather amusing, certainly did not take it seriously. I should have taken it seriously, but I didn't. She was so fit. She never had any palpitations or breathlessness or chest pain. She never fainted while lying down or while exerting herself, and she exerted herself a lot: walking everywhere at top speed, playing badminton, etc.

In January 2022, while I was away, she wrote to me: 'I'm just getting up now after 38 hours rest and sleep in bed. I feel fine now. On Saturday afternoon I briefly fainted and bumped my head on my desk. It was probably accumulated fatigue and residual exam stress \[she spent her retirement studying\].'

The next episode was in the summer of 2022: she felt faint without entirely losing consciousness, staggered and broke her fall with her hands going down, but also managed to break her little toe. She went to her GP about the broken toe but, as it turns out, didn't mention why she had fallen. A couple of months later she fainted while on an excursion and was caught by an acquaintance, a retired vet, who advised her to take magnesium supplements. She did and it seemed to help. She had no loss of consciousness after that for two years, just a couple of very brief, mild dizzy spells in the summer of 2023.

In February 2024 our much-loved cat died and she especially was very sad. In September 2024 she was under some stress about stuff regarding the university where she was studying, and at the end of September 2024 she had a sudden loss of consciousness while standing in the supermarket and hit her head hard on the floor. We went to the emergency room. Her EKG and head CT were normal, and she was about to be discharged when she fainted again sitting up in bed. She was admitted and given a transthoracic echocardiogram, bloodwork and an ultrasound of her carotid arteries. Everything was normal. I feel though that I did not give a good enough history of her fainting spells -- her medical file from this hospital stay says that she had had 'previous episodes of this type, the most recent three years ago' when in fact it had been two years ago. When she was seen by a cardiologist he asked if it had happened before and I didn't emphasise enough that it had happened half a dozen times before -- I just said yes, once three years back she had fainted and fallen out of her chair in a cafe and been worked up in the ER, and he seemed most interested in whether or not I had witnessed the event, which I had not. I think he was wondering if it was a seizure as he asked whether she had been heard to cry out/groan. He then asked about the second fainting spell the previous day that had decided them to admit her and she said she had felt nauseated before it had happened, and that seemed to make up his mind that this was vasovagal syncope. He showed her how to lie down and get her legs in the air if she felt faint so as to stop the loss of consciousness in its tracks. But he also said that if she passed out again, they'd put in an implantable loop recorder to check on her heart just in case.

I had a nagging bad feeling after this. I felt that maybe the loop recorder should have been put in right away. I felt that maybe I should have made clear that she'd had multiple previous episodes.

She went to see her GP, who told her not to worry as her test results were fine. A couple of days after discharge from the hospital she felt faint and sweaty while we were in a museum, so I got her to do her counterpressure manoeuvres -- head down, toes wiggling -- and it cleared without her losing consciousness. Thereafter there was nothing until she had a brief similar spell at the beginning of March, which again passed without her losing consciousness. She had mild obstructive sleep apnoea, not severe enough for a CPAP according to the sleep specialist I got her to see in 2023, and I thought this might be at the root of the fainting (I had also mentioned it to the hospital cardiologist) and worked successfully on getting her to sleep on her side to stop the apnoeic episodes.

Then on 14 March she fainted while in class, fell out of her chair and blacked her eye. Afterwards she was checked out by paramedics who told her her systolic BP was 170 -- it was normally around 120. I knew following this recurrence that something serious was happening. I got her classmate to send her a description of this most recent fainting event, wrote up a full history of her fainting spells from May 2021 onwards, and sent her off to her GP, who made an urgent cardiology referral. She took the history and description to the cardiologist. The cardiologist got another normal EKG out of her, noted some orthostatic hypotension and told her to drink lots of water, advice that she conscientiously followed. He said that it could well be vasovagal syncope, but that an implantable loop recorder would be placed for three years nonetheless. Nothing was said to indicate that there might be a serious risk to her life. She was waiting for the call from the hospital for the appointment to place the loop recorder. She described herself during this time as feeling fatigued in the evenings but not nauseated or dizzy. Then she got her energy back and was her usual self, charging around, studying hard for an exam.

On 17 April she died suddenly, in bed. She didn't have her shoes or her bag on. Her coffee was in the machine waiting to be made. The results of the autopsy were inconclusive.

Can I surmise that most likely she had an undetected arrhythmia and died from that?",1,1746725837.0,askCardiology,0,1.0,False

I want to start off by saying that I recognize members of this sub are not medical professionals. I have a consultation with a professional soon, but wanted to get perspectives from other women with ADHD while I wait. Everyone I have described the following symptoms to so far keeps telling me that they are common things most people experience, but when I talk to my therapist, she says they’re not. I don’t know if I am gaslighting myself into thinking I might have ADHD when I don’t.

- I misplace my phone a LOT. My partner has started keeping a tally of how often I misplace it(this was before we thought I had ADHD), and I lose it twice as much as him. Also, he is not with me for 8 hours per day and yesterday I noticed that I misplaced my phone 3 times while we’re not together. 

- I really struggle to start work-related tasks. I can accomplish them by the deadline when I’m close to the deadline, but it’s hard for me to start without that pressure. 

- I find it hard to pay attention to people’s stories, but specifically when they’re talking about something descriptive like their dreams or a book they read. The other day my boyfriend told me three sentences about the book he was reading, and after we decided to see how much I retained (spoiler: I retained very little). 

- I have always, always, always been bad at doing daily hygiene things (brushing teeth, taking meds, taking showers). 

- I can only work at coffee shops right now. If I’m at home, I waste the day away on my phone. I have to push myself to get out of the house and once I’m at a coffee shop with my noise-cancelling headphones on, then I can do things. Guess where I’m writing this post.

<div>### Unlocking the Power of Functional Beverages

Functional beverages have been gaining immense popularity due to their ability to provide added health benefits beyond basic hydration. Unlike regular drinks, these beverages are formulated with ingredients that offer nutritional or therapeutic advantages. functional beverages into your daily routine can support various aspects of your well-being, often without you realizing their full potential. Let’s dive into ten surprising benefits of these drinks that may change the way you think about what you sip.

### 1. Enhanced Hydration with Added Nutrients

While drinking water is essential, functional beverages elevate hydration by including electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals. These additional ingredients help replenish your body's fluid balance more efficiently, particularly after exercise or extended periods in the heat. This means you stay hydrated longer and recover faster compared to plain water.

### 2. Boosted Immune System

Many functional drinks are enriched with antioxidants such as vitamin C, zinc, and herbal extracts like echinacea or ginger. These components stimulate your immune defenses and help your body fight off common colds and infections. Regular consumption can contribute to fewer sick days and overall improved resilience.

### 3. Improved Digestive Health

Functional beverages often contain probiotics and prebiotics, which support the growth of healthy gut bacteria. A balanced gut microbiome aids digestion, reduces bloating, and enhances nutrient absorption. If you’ve struggled with indigestion, sipping on a probiotic-rich drink could bring welcome relief.

### 4. Natural Energy Boost

Instead of reaching for sugary sodas or high-caffeine energy drinks, functional beverages offer natural energy enhancers such as green tea extract, ginseng, or B vitamins. These ingredients provide a steady, sustained energy release without the jitters or crashes that often come with traditional energy boosters.

### 5. Support for Mental Clarity and Focus

Mental fatigue can drag down your productivity and mood. Some functional drinks are infused with nootropics like L-theanine or adaptogens like ashwagandha, which help improve concentration, reduce stress, and promote a calm, alert state of mind. This makes them ideal for busy professionals and students alike.

### 6. Anti-inflammatory Properties

Chronic inflammation is linked to many health issues, from arthritis to heart disease. Ingredients such as turmeric, green tea, and omega-3 fatty acids in functional beverages can help reduce inflammation. Regular consumption may contribute to decreased pain and enhanced joint mobility.

### 7. Weight Management Assistance

Certain functional beverages support weight control by boosting metabolism and reducing appetite. For example, drinks containing green coffee bean extract, cayenne pepper, or soluble fibers can help you feel fuller for longer and enhance fat burning when paired with a healthy diet and exercise.

### 8. Better Skin Health

Hydration is vital for glowing skin, but functional beverages provide extra benefits through antioxidants and collagen-boosting ingredients like vitamin E, biotin, or hyaluronic acid. These nutrients promote skin elasticity, reduce wrinkles, and protect against UV damage. Drinking these beverages can be a tasty addition to your skincare routine.

### 9. Convenient Nutritional Supplement

Sometimes, it’s tough to get all the nutrients your body needs from food alone. Functional beverages act as a convenient and effective supplement, delivering essential vitamins and minerals in a delicious, easily digestible form. This can be especially helpful for people with busy lifestyles or specific dietary restrictions.

### 10. Enhanced Workout Performance and Recovery

Fitness enthusiasts and athletes often turn to functional beverages to enhance their performance. These drinks can contain branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), electrolytes, and antioxidants, all of which support muscle recovery, reduce soreness, and maintain energy levels during intense physical activity. Consuming functional beverages before or after exercise helps you train harder and recover faster.

### Functional Beverages into Your Day

Choosing the right functional beverage depends on your personal health goals. Whether you want to improve immunity, boost brainpower, or aid digestion, there is a functional drink tailored for your needs. When selecting these beverages, check the ingredient list for natural sources of nutrients and avoid added sugars or artificial additives to maximize benefits.

By recognizing the many benefits functional beverages can offer, you can make smarter choices that enhance your health in enjoyable and effortless ways. Next time you reach for a drink, consider a functional beverage — it might just provide the extra boost your body has been missing.

By choosing the right functional drinks, you can boost your energy, improve digestion, and even enhance your mood.

#### 1. Enhanced Hydration with Nutrients

Staying hydrated is key to wellness, but many people overlook how adding nutrients can change water’s impact on your body. Functional beverages often include electrolytes like potassium and magnesium, which help your body absorb fluids faster and maintain balance. This is especially useful after exercise or on hot days.

#### 2. Improved Gut Health

Many functional drinks contain probiotics and prebiotics that nourish your gut microbiome. A healthy gut not only aids digestion but also supports your immune system and fights inflammation. Drinking these beverages regularly can reduce bloating and promote smoother digestion.

#### 3. Natural Energy Boosts Without Crash

Unlike coffee or sugary sodas, functional energy drinks provide steady energy using natural ingredients like green tea extract, ginseng, or B vitamins. These ingredients help you stay alert and focused without the jitters or crashes associated with caffeine overdoses.

#### 4. Antioxidant Protection

Many functional beverages are rich in antioxidants, which protect your cells from damage caused by free radicals. Ingredients such as berries, green tea, and turmeric add antioxidant power to your drink, supporting your body’s defense system and promoting longevity.

#### 5. Better Skin and Hair Health

Some functional beverages include collagen peptides or hyaluronic acid, which can contribute to healthier skin and stronger hair. These nutrients work from inside your body to improve moisture retention, elasticity, and repair damaged tissues, helping you look and feel your best.

#### 6. Stress Reduction

Adaptogenic herbs like ashwagandha, holy basil, or rhodiola found in certain functional drinks can help your body manage stress more effectively. Regular consumption supports hormone balance and calms the nervous system, making it easier to handle everyday pressures.

#### 7. Immune System Support

Vitamin C, zinc, and echinacea are often added to functional beverages to strengthen your immune defenses. These nutrients help your body fight off infections and recover faster, especially during cold and flu season.

#### 8. Weight Management Assistance

Some functional drinks contain metabolism-boosting ingredients such as green tea catechins or fiber that promote feelings of fullness. Including these beverages in your diet can aid your weight management efforts by reducing cravings and supporting fat oxidation.

Neuro-enhancing ingredients like omega-3 fatty acids, ginkgo biloba, or bacopa extract help improve cognitive function and memory. These functional beverages can help you stay sharp and focused throughout your day.

#### 10. Convenient Nutrition On-The-Go

One of the biggest practical advantages is convenience. Functional beverages provide a quick and easy way to get important nutrients without preparing complicated meals or supplements. This makes them perfect for busy lifestyles and helps maintain consistency in your health routine.

### How to Choose the Right Functional Beverage for You

With so many options available, picking the right functional beverage can feel daunting. Start by identifying your wellness priorities:

- If digestion is a concern, look for drinks with probiotics or prebiotics.
- For energy, opt for natural caffeine sources combined with B vitamins.
- If skin health matters, seek beverages fortified with collagen or antioxidants.
- Stress and mood support may require adaptogen-rich drinks.

Also, check the ingredient list to avoid additives, excessive sugars, or artificial flavors. Choose products that use natural ingredients and transparent labeling to ensure quality.

### Functional Beverages Into Your Daily Life

Integrating functional beverages into your daily routine is simple. Replace sugary drinks with nutrient-packed waters or start your morning with an antioxidant-rich herbal infusion. For mid-day energy slumps, reach for a natural energy shot instead of processed snacks. Over time, these small swaps can lead to meaningful improvements in your health and well-being.

Remember, functional beverages work best as part of a balanced diet and active lifestyle. Drinking them alongside wholesome foods, regular exercise, and adequate sleep will maximize their benefits and help you achieve your health goals more effectively.

### Conclusion

Functional beverages offer more than just hydration—they bring a wealth of health benefits that can support your well-being every day. From boosting your immune system to enhancing digestion and providing natural energy, these drinks are designed to do more than quench thirst. By incorporating functional beverages into your routine, you’re giving your body valuable nutrients and bioactive ingredients that help you stay focused, balanced, and energized.

Understanding the unique advantages these drinks provide shows how they fit perfectly into your daily health and wellness goals. Whether you’re aiming to improve gut health, manage stress, or increase antioxidant intake, functional beverages can be a simple and enjoyable way to support these needs. They bring convenience without sacrificing nutrition, making it easier for you to maintain healthy habits throughout a busy day.

By choosing the right functional beverages, you take an active step towards enhancing your overall quality of life. These drinks can help fill nutritional gaps, improve your physical and mental performance, and promote lasting wellness. So the next time you reach for a refreshing drink, consider a functional beverage that nourishes your body at the same time.

So far my recovery has been pretty good. I’m slowly eating foods again and not having to run to the bathroom like so many people on the internet warned of. So I’d say I’m pretty lucky! 

The only thing, however, is that coffee will make me have diarrhea almost Instantly, and it has been the only sort of bowel movement I’ve had since surgery. I haven’t had a “regular” bowel movement yet, it’s all been diarrhea triggered by coffee.

I have always had to go to the bathroom after coffee, even before surgery. So I’m just wondering if the diarrhea is me still adjusting after surgery or if this is just a continuous thing that my body does with coffee. 

I’m hoping to start having some regular bowel movements soon but I know it may take time time. What are your experiences? It’s just hard to tell if the diarrhea is a reflection of surgery or just my usual thing. Is it true Metamucil helps? Any tips? Thank you! ",2,1746725359.0,gallbladders,3,1.0,False

1khvvme,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1khvvme/how_to_meet_people/,How to meet people,"21M. I’m not an incell I promise just hear me out. I broke up with my very long term gf of around 6 years some time ago. I had all the love in the world for her and I still feel her touch and good memories often. However she changed a lot in those 6 years and more or less turned into an asshole with no ambition or desire or romance in her at all. She became a poison in my life and she felt gone long before she actually left. That being said we were always there for each other and I always had someone around that would want to talk with me or at least fight about something. We did everything together. 

Now that it’s just me and my small group of friends that I have and my family that are both awesome. I want to go out on my own once in a while when my friends all want to hang out with their WIVES… 

Where do I go? How do conduct myself alone without anyone to be out with? I don’t want to go to a club or a wine tasting or coffee or gathering of some kind and be on my phone to distract myself from everyone else who’s with the groups they came with. How do you meet new people when you’re not in school or work with a lot of people?

I guess I’m not even really looking for a relationship, but that’s what I want. I really just wish that the good periods of time with my ex lasted forever. Because it was so damn good. And she is so beautiful. We were each other’s first and only strong love experiences and I really wanted that to be forever. I think that’s romantic. My parents are like that too and they’re doing very well. I guess I just picked the wrong person.

If nobody reads this it’ll be ok because I honestly just needed to get this down. I have friends and family that I could be vulnerable with but I can only let out a few tears at a time. ",1,1746725276.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1khvv05,https://www.reddit.com/r/rs_x/comments/1khvv05/jimmy_stewart_impersonator_seeking_advice/,Jimmy Stewart Impersonator Seeking Advice,"Since I graduated college a couple years ago, I’ve been working as the main barista at this small cafe. The cafe is inside a clothing store, and it’s really only there to make the store itself look cooler and to get people in the door and buying the expensive clothing. It’s pretty quiet most of the time, so I get some freedom when it’s slow to read my silly books and try and write my silly essays. It’s not stressful, but there’s a lot of annoying corporate shit tied to the store. Also, this place is a center of a yuppie sport subculture in town that I really can’t stand. My friends will come in from time to time, but mostly the people who I’m seeing every day are middle-aged men who are caught up in a stupid dick-measuring contest. I don’t get paid well.

Now, there’s another coffee shop just next door. This place would pay better and it would be a lot busier. It’s a real coffee shop, not just a little bar inside of a clothing store. As such, there’s different kinds of people that come in - for better and for worse. There’s young people, and there’s families, and influencers working from home, and old people with nothing better to do than to yell at the employees. It would be nice to get paid a little more, to work in a place that’s a bigger center for the community, but I also know I’ll have less freedom to do my own thing. There won’t be that time where I pull out my book and read while no one’s there. I can’t sneak my friends free coffees and beers we have in the back.

All I want is to be able to give coffee to the friends who come in, and meet new people who like the same shit I like. At it's best, this place I'm at right now feels like a sitcom, where you don't know which one of you're friends will come in, but you know that one of them will. But mostly it's people I don't like. I don’t care about working my way up in the coffee world or anything like that. I just want to talk to people and be an active part of a little community.

The question touches on a conversation I have with my friends all the time. Our town kinda sucks. The people who move here tend to have a lot of money and no taste. There’s a few of us who stayed after college for one reason or another, but mostly the demographic seems to be 35+, making a shit ton of money in a remote job, and trying to keep things exactly how they are. But, the longer I stay here the more cool people I meet, people who also want to leave, but get sucked in by this little micro-community of outsiders that exist here. The longer these folks stay here, the bigger the chance that we can create the community we want to see in this town. I think this job thing is the same. The place I’m at now kinda sucks. The new place will suck as well probably. But here, I get the chance to try and mold the community I want to see. I probably can’t do that at the new place as much. But maybe I can.

I was a little surprised that my doctors want to check me so thoroughly because I don't feel particularly unhealthy or anxious about my PVCs any more (unlike 5 years ago when I first noticed them and had regular panic attacks at night.) and I don't even feel them so I decided not to worry about it too much.

  
However now that my doctors want to run all those tests I do get a little worried now. It's gotta be a little serious if they almost force me into those checks right? And if not now then maybe in 10 or 20 years? I sure hope they only do this because I am relatively young and they want to make sure not to miss anything but man... now I am worried!

  
Anyway, for the next couple of months:

\- Why can I drink green tea but not coffee? Can I even drink green tea or was my apothecarian lying?

\- really, no alcohol? It's not like I drink excessively but I'd give a lot for just one glass of wine when I am in spain next month

\- The current side effects I feel: I am colder than usual. And hungrier and slower during work out. Is it normal to feel like this early on? I'm like 4 days in and will these get worse?

\- what is it like to discontinue those eventually (In case I can in three months)? Could I have strong symptoms or is there nothing to worry about because the dose is low?  
  
\- am I imagining things or am I more relaxed than usual? I feel like my social anxiety symptoms are gone

1khvrhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1khvrhr/will_the_oxo_brew_8_cup_coffee_maker_meet_your/,Will the OXO Brew 8 Cup Coffee Maker meet your needs Review?,"**A Hands-On Review of the OXO 8718800 Brew 8 Cup Coffee Maker**  

Using the OXO 8718800 Brew 8 Cup Coffee Maker daily has been quite the experience. It’s a medium-sized coffee maker with a sleek stainless steel and black design that blends into any modern kitchen. The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) certification caught my attention initially since I’m picky about my coffee. Straight out of the box, it impressed me with its sturdy build and attention to detail. I couldn’t wait to test every feature.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The compact design is a standout feature. Measuring around 10.5"" x 7"" x 13.5"", it effortlessly fits under cabinets—a huge plus for those with limited counter space like me. The stainless-steel construction lends a premium feel, and the black accents add to its understated elegance. I found the inclusion of a double-wall vacuum-insulated carafe especially thoughtful. It doesn’t just look nice; it keeps coffee warm for hours without burning, something my household greatly appreciates during weekend breakfasts.

**Ease of Use and Features**  
Switching to this coffee maker from my old one felt like upgrading to a smarter device. There’s a manual operation mode that provides great control over brewing. The single-serve capability is enhanced by an optional accessory that allows you to brew directly into your favorite travel mug. I tested this with my tall mug, and all I had to do was remove the well cover. It’s these small details that make life convenient.

The Rainmaker™ showerhead spreads water evenly, and I could notice that every ground particle was saturated when brewing a carafe. Additionally, its integrated bloom cycle does a wonderful job of enriching the flavor during extraction. Whether you’re making one cup or eight, you get consistent results.  

**Highlights**  
- Certified by the Specialty Coffee Association, ensuring top-tier brewing standards.  
- Compact and sleek design that works for small kitchens.  
- Includes papers filters and a coffee scoop for immediate use.  
- Double-wall thermal carafe for optimal heat retention.  
- Easy cleaning with a dedicated cleaning mode.  

[Find the best price for OXO 8718800 on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07h9g93wk/)  

**Performance and Usability**  
Performance is where this coffee maker excels. Thanks to BetterBrew™ precision controls, I could rely on it maintaining consistent water temperature and timing. At first, I wondered if the brewing process would differ significantly between single-serve and full-carafe modes. After testing both extensively, I was pleasantly surprised to find no noticeable difference in flavor or temperature. My upstairs neighbor, who often borrows it when I’m away, agrees!  

Another favorite feature of mine is the brew-through, pour-through carafe lid. No more messing around with opening lids—it saves time and helps avoid spillage. It has become part of my morning rhythm.  

**Strengths**  
- Consistent flavor and temperature control.  
- Versatile brewing for one cup or a carafe.  
- Convenient removable well cover for different mug sizes.  
- Simple operation that’s intuitive even for first-time users.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite the excellent performance, there are a few hurdles.  

- The brewing process is slightly slower compared to some models in the same category.  
- The coffee maker runs on manual operation only, which could deter those preferring automatic start timers.  
- Its higher-end pricing might make some hesitant despite its features.  

**Peer Products**  
Comparing the OXO Brew to competing models like the Technivorm Moccamaster or the Breville Precision Brewer, I noticed this machine holds its own. While the Moccamaster is renowned for its fast brewing and durability, it isn’t as compact or visually appealing. The Breville Precision Brewer offers advanced programmability, but its steep learning curve isn’t for everyone. The OXO stands balanced with its precision brewing and user-friendly aspects, making it an excellent choice for casual coffee lovers who value ease of use without sacrificing quality.  

**Value Proposition**  
Considering its features, the OXO Brew 8 Cup Coffee Maker delivers great value. Its robust build, precise brewing, and thoughtful add-ons like the Rainmaker™ and thermal carafe justify its investment. For someone like me who seeks consistency without too many bells and whistles, it strikes the right balance between quality and cost-effectiveness.

Just as a warning, I am not a hero, and I learned my way through life the hard way. You might not like me at first, but my life decisions and mistakes were necessary to take me where I am. I leave it here for comments, since so al planning to expand it and make a book.

My memoir:

“Get out of my school! You are expelled. All of your classmates are going to be better without you” those were the words of my high school principal after expelling me. 

I had been in that school since I was 5. I am from a small city in Mexico. This was supposed to be an Elite private school: catholic and just for boys. My family had wealth in the past, but it was all gone by the time I was 2 due to an economic crisis that made my grandfather business go to bankruptcy. However, all my parents social cycle was “elite”. 

I was put in that school since elementary school. We were almost the same 23 people in the group all elementary and middle school. During that time, I received bullying from almost all the group, starting when I was five. It lasted all the way until I was 16. 

During that time, my parents were more focused on their own narrative of having his son in an “elite” school instead of focusing on my own well being. I was not excelling at school; had just one or two friends; had nicknames; physical and verbal abuse. 

In my house, if I tried to fight back, I was severely punished; their advice was to “tell the teachers”. If I tried to say that I wanted to change school they said: “you are the in the best school in town”, “if you change you are not going to do anything with your life”, “we are doing a lot of effort to have you there”. Likewise, I had constant comparisons, in particular from my father, who said: “when I was young, I was friend of everybody, why can’t you do the same?”, “why you cannot have good grades as John Smith?”  Basically, I was told to trust the school to take care of my problems; try to be a people pleaser and seek validation to be “a friend of everybody”; and feeling guilt of trying to change school because  “I was in the best”. I was in pain both in school and at my house, dealing with the frustration, and strong character of my father at the time for over 10 years.

My father had a very good year back in 2007, so he decided to send me to a boarding school in the US, that was ultra elite, and from the same school brand I was in. We were around 200 men living in the suburbs of a very small town. We did everything there: take classes, sleep, do sports, etc.

That was my first change of context that I had in my whole life. At the time, I thought about myself as a problematic child, who was bullied. So I acted that way in the boarding school as well: so I was bullied there too. However, there was a minuscule difference: back in Mexico I was always picked last while choosing teams in sport, but, in the boarding school I was picked in the middle. That small thing made me question my entire statu quo: why here am I not picked last? Would it be that all my classmates are not correct in their judgements? 

In the boarding school we had an astrobiology class, and it was given by a former NASA employee. He always wrote in the board: ad astra per aspera, which means: to the stars through hardships. That became my life’s lemma, and my motivation giver. 

My first step in motivation was to go to the Gym there. I became strong, and gain more respect. I did not became popular, just became more respected, marginally. The bullying stopped for a bit, or reduced drastically. I was in the boarding school for a year.

Back in Mexico, I kept going to the gym. I gained a little more respect from my classmates. However, I still lacked the social skills, and was perturbed from 10+ non stop bullying and problems in my house. Eventually, the bullying came back again. However, I was stronger, so I started fighting back. 

People in the school, including teachers always thought that I was problematic: since elementary schoolI was always having discipline problems. Now, after coming back, the school principal decided that she had enough and decided to spell me with the words I quoted in the beginning. 

So there I was: a problematic, bullied guy with no friends, extremely angry with life, bad humor and no extracurricular activities. The only place that I was able to get in another “elite” school where the principal was friend of an uncle. When I got there since day 1, the news about my background were already spread: so I was bullied once again. In the first month I was in the orientation office at least 6 times; there was moment that the discipline teacher said when I was entering into her office “not again!”.


This was a mixed school, so there were both girls and boys there. I fell in love with a woman which I was starting to date, but she rejected me once the bullying started in this new school after just one month of moving in. I felt hopeless. So I decided to look in the internet: “how to get your girlfriend back”. Then I found a book called “how to be an alpha male”. Even if this book is no written properly, is amateurish, and the author is not know, it changed my life forever with a simple idea that I had never thought of before: you can change your own destiny by changing your habits.

I started approaching girls without feel of rejection, since all my life I got plenty of it. I started putting into test all the principles of the book. Likewise, I decided to reinvent myself and learn from nothing all social skills I lacked.

I remember starting going out to nightclubs alone (yes in Mexico you can get into nightclubs at 16-17) to approach random people and learn new facts about people. I wrote everything in a notebook. My motivation was that every failure took me closer to the truth (my own truth). This made me a self/thought philosopher; a creator of my own way of living and with my own set of principles.

When I was in my sophomore year. My father started having severe economic crisis. He did not gave me much money to go out. He gave me for the week and equivalent of $7-8. With that, I had to use it for anything that I wanted to consume in parties and to figure out how to go back home by (1 am). This lead me into a situation of feeling poor: I could not spend much, and had to depend on other people to go back home. If I was not able to do it by 1 am, my father would get very mad.

I made very good friends during this time, who helped me deal with my father’s severity and strong character. However, we loved getting wasted, and picking up girls: that became our way of living. We got drunk, and had sex with as many girls as possible. Since the first book I had to change my identity was about getting as many girls I wanted, it is natural that my ideal was to become a Casanova, although, right now it is not by the way.

I spoke to thousands of girls, and was rejected by too many of them. I was so much rejected that I became inmune to it. To deal with social anxiety and shyness, I desired to sing in front of all the school and without being a singer in a talent show “with me, by sum 41”.

At this moment, bullying suddenly stopped in my high school. Now my identity was that of trying to be a party boy with a lot of girls. I did not care about school; I did not do homework or have extracurricular activities: I just went home to read books from Robert Greene to keep building up my social skills, and improving my interpersonal and essentialist intelligence. 

In my high school, people still did not like me due to the reputation I build from my first year as bullied. Also, even though the bullying stopped and I was more social, I was socially awkward and not calibrated. Outside school, I only had fiends who shared the same hedonistic was of thinking; I was not liked by girls as a friend because they all said that I was “weird” from trying to pick up all the time. However, this was the best social life I got so far in my now 19 years old at the time.

By that time, my father’s financial situation was getting worst. I had to start working in my afternoons putting groceries in people’s bags in the supermarket; and as a bar tender in a mediocre bar during my vacations: just with that I can had a little money to spend on party and with my new friends.

I have a little sister, who is 4 years younger than me. My father had some mommy issues with my grandmother, since my grandparents were divorce after my grandmother and her lover crashed while being drunker  and killed somebody. So he was very inclined for giving everything to my sister so he could relief his sense of abandonment from his mother. This translated into unequal treatment between her and a younger brother and I. Basically, she was given everything with no effort, while we had to “solve our own problems”. For example, I was forced to use the public transportation since I had to “solve” my own things; while he always picked her and drive her anywhere she wanted whenever she wanted. She also had a new blackberry at the time, while I had a sonic Erickson cybershot with a keyboard that fell (and I had to guess the keys) during my whole high school.

After this, in my senior year, my parent told me that he had no money to pay for my tuition. That I had to earn a scholarship or pay my university. However, my GPA was around 2.9: so no scholarships would be available to me. I decided to take a shot and apply to CIDE, which is the best economic school in Mexico. They asked for a minimum 3.0 GPA. So I decided to apply: they had a 20% or less acceptance rate. Admission at the time depended on 4 filters: 1) 1300 SAT, with 700 in math minimum 2) a strong math and Spanish exams 3) an interview, and 4) an intensive 1 month with 3 exams that needed to be passed. So I put energy into my last semester of my senior year and pushed my GPA to be 3.3

For some reason, I passed the first 3 filters. The first SAT I did I got 1292, so they let me do it again; I miraculously got 1300. I guessed that it was luck. I also passed the second and third filter. But when I was in the last one (1 month studying an intensive course in the school), all the luck faded and the very strong math kicked in: all the math that I did not studied ever before started to affect me: I did not understand anything at first. We had to do around 200 exercises daily: I made all. However, I flopped the first two exams with 1/10 and 2/10 scores: even with a final 8.3/10, I did not hit the minimum passing score.

My backup plan was to study in Anahuac University, a private university with “good reputation”. I got a 30% scholarship and 30% credit. My parents did not accepted and wanted me to go into a mediocre university and pay it myself by working in the afternoon. I decided to do not take that advice and try again for the next year to go into CIDE. 

For that year, a friend of my mother worked in admissions of an engineering school in my town. So I was allowed to go to engineering math classes twice a week to prepare for  CIDE admissions. However, I discovered that the pace was very slow, and that in the first midterm of Calculus 1, I got a 93/100, while the second highest grade was around 62/100. There I discovered that I had the capability of being in a top tier school and I did not wanted to be in a mediocre college.

Then I did my SAT again and got 1493 points, with 795 in math. I was shocked. My 200 math problems a day were paying off. That year, the 4th filter was removed. So I had just to pass the heavy math exam and the interview, which I did. So I was able to get into the finest economic school in Mexico by studying so hard for 6 months. The other 6 months before getting into college I worked with a friend of my mom that was the Ministry of economics department of the state where I was living. Basically I gave him coffee, received guests, and went to many events.

When I started college, it felt like an elementary school: we were only one small group of people studying economics, and the classes schedules were fixed for us. We were around 60 people, and it was the largest group ever in the story of the institution. I was surrounded by people that I considered “nerds”, which in the end reminded me of my bullied years. I had an identity of “party man” and “womanizer”. So I rejected them, and they rejected me back: the story was repeating itself. While I was not bullied, I felt rejected and out of place: I was always trying to meet beautiful women that were in a rich people university that was just across the street. I also had fobia of staying too much in a classroom, and wanted to avoid staying too much inside the school, it was a natural response, since I never felt secure inside a classroom, or academic institution.


Even though I perfected my skills of approaching and meeting girls, I was rejected after just a few messages or dates, since I did not had enough money. By that time, I won a 75% scholarship to attend CIDE, which was given to me for my financial situation. I was also given a $300 budget by the school for my own expenses. With that money I paid half my rent and all my expenses for the month: food, groceries, school expenses, party, transportation, etc. 

CIDE was located in a highway which was in front of a cliff. I was renting a place just across the school in a kind of students house that very cheap. It looked like a poor property of a stereotype Mexican village. I was in a place that the sunlight never reached: it was called “the cave” by the students. 

The university was extremely hard. I was studying all day. The grades were deflated so they tended to be very low, and we needed to have at least a 2.7 GPA per semester, else we were not allowed to continue studying. This kind of stress led me to develop addiction to cigarettes: I was smoking at least 20 cigarettes a day of a very cheap brand. I was 20 at the time.

By the time I was in my sophomore year, almost half of the 60 people we were in the school were already out: most of them for not having the minimum 2.7 GPA. I had around 3.3 at the time. I was basically studying all day. However, in Thursday I did not had any classes. Therefore, I always went to pick up girls in the school next door; on Friday afternoon I hanged out with one of my high school friends who shared the same hedonistic life. He was studying in another university nearby which was consider as well a rich university. So we always hanged out with his friends.

When I finished my sophomore year. Something tragic happened: my mom decided to left my father because she encountered an old boyfriend of her. She was my emotional support during my whole childhood: she defended me from my father and listened to me when I felt bad about the bullying. So this was felt as a betrayal and almost broke me. From that day, I started having a closer relationship with my dad: we both shared the goal of deciphering what went wrong. 

I stopped speaking to my mother for at least 3 months. I was completely broken hearted. My father as well. If he was in a bad economic situation, this broke him and made him start to make very stupid decisions. For example, we had our own house (from better times). He decided to sell it and invested badly all the money. One of those investments was to pay Anahuac university to my sister: I had a better GPA and conditions to get into it, and, under better conditions I was rejected from it, while she had the privilege of doing so. Also, she was given a costly apartment that was in one of the most expensive places in town so she could be “close to university”, while I was in “the cave”.

Instead of this situations breaking me. I desired to push further. When I was at half of my junior year, I was given the opportunity, due to my grades, of going to Ireland as an exchange. I got a credit, and, with it, I paid my plane tickets and my first month of rent. My father supported me with rent payments, and with my 
$300 budget I had to survive there: doing sightseeing, travel, pay my food and school materials.

There I met some Spanish friends. They became the first mixed group (females and males) I had. I felt very good: while back in Mexico with my friends we were always competing who kissed more women, I did not felt that competition, and I even did not want to actively be seeking women: I discovered that what I really wanted were deep connections. I was able to get first class honors without a lot of effort.

Those times in Ireland were of the most joy for me. There was one time when I said to myself: If I die today, it would not matter, since I am happy. This year let me be away of a very tough and small school, focus on having a normal university life and create deep connections. When the semester was over and I had to go back to Mexico, I decided to stay a little longer and travel around Europe. To do so, I got a job in a hotel, whose owner was the Mexican consulate in that city. My job was hard: destroying bottles that were meant to recycle, clean tables, map the floors, and I was even a construction worker for a couple of days. With it, I was able to travel around Europe, with my own money, and pay my ticket back home.

Back in Mexico, I discovered that all my best friends while I was not there became addicted to Weed. Two of them even drop out school because of their addiction. I remained without smoking it for my first semester of my senior year. However, at the end of the semester, I decided to quit smoking cold turkey after hearing a classmate say: as generation purpose we should make Me stop smoking. There I took my first programming class: I asked for a computer to him so I could take this class; but instead, he bought one for my sister, who in fact did not need it because she was studying “international studies”. So I had to learn how to code using my notebook, and then test everything out using the university’s library computers.

So I grabbed my last cigarette I ever smoked in January first 2018. I was felling really bad after it; I could not sleep. My father always told me about his “magic pill” that made him sleep after 
My mom left us. So I really wanted that magical pill: we went to see a doctor who prescribed it to me: it was clonazepam. I instantly became addicted to it. That thing also made me lower my standards and begin smoking weed regularly. This made my grades go down; I stopped going to classes; arrived late; I was uninterested in them, and I was delayed in my thesis. In the end, my grades went down to a have a 7.6/10; just the minimal for not getting expelled in my last semester. 

I was able to graduate with a 8.5/100. Which was good, but was a heavy downgrade of my previous average. I was very depressed and in addition. While I was in Ireland, my father moved from my childhood home (that I lived from 1 to 23 years old) to another that was in the same neighborhood. Right after graduation, I did not looked for a job, I was just interested in smoking weed, and seeing my hedonistic friends. 

It broke me that my childhood home was tired apart, and I was able to see it from the new house, which we were renting instead of owning. That was my safe place from bullying, and what I felt (and I still fell that is) my home. In my new home, I was sleeping in an old mattress with coil springs that hurtes me, since we do not have money for paying for a base or a new mattress.

Living in that house was a living hell: my father was depressed, my sister loss her scholarship due to bad grades and stopped living in her department. I began to date a sugar momma who was 40 years old, who gave me money monthly for teaching his son math: dating her was my way of going to parties and continue with my hedonistic behavior. With the money she gave me I bought Weed, and twice I tried LSD.

One night, after getting drunk, with clonazepam and weed, my sister woke my father up because “I had the light of the kitchen on” and she could not sleep. So my father came down to complain. To put into context, anytime that I asked my father for help when I had an issue with my sister he said: “solve the problems between each other”, but when my sister had an issue with me or my brother he always without exception defended her. Now, in that context, when he approach to complain, I started hitting him repeatedly saying: “stop spoiling her”! My sister was trying to call the police, I noticed what happened and decided to go to my mother’s place.

That moment, I investigated about the effects of clonazepam (I had taken it daily for 10 months). So so decided in a couple of weeks after that to stop it cold turkey. It was the worst feeling that I have very had: I had hallucinations, insomnia, shakes, paranoia, and extreme anxiety. Luckily, I was not working at the moment. By that time I decided as well to have to stop using Weed. That was by December 2018. Since then, I have not used Clonazepam or weed. 

I remember the extreme cravings, the sleepless nights that I thought that were never going to end. Staying up all night in my mattress in the floor just counting the minutes for the night to come and hopefully be the lucky night I could sleep. However, I remained strong: I went all day to the park to calm down and be in contact with nature. 

By that time, I was contacted by a professor of mine, that happened to be my school advisor. He had a phd from Cornell, and was famous of having one of the toughest classes, where I got an A. He contacted me with a portfolio manger from one of the top three insurance companies in the world who was looking for an economist for his team (for Mexico office). He interviewed me and was impressed by the way I draw and paint (I developed this habilite because that was the way I dealt with my complex emotions before). So he decided to give me a chance.

So this was me, getting my first formal job at 25. In the first 6 months I was there, I was dealing still with clonazepam withdrawal. So there were times that I got to the office without sleeping for a week. For such reasons, I was never accepted by my peers at first. It was during this moment that my manager gave me the job of doing some machine learning models in R. He was impressed of my passion for coding.

My manager became my true friend: he was the older brother that I did not had. He taught me the way of doing things in a work place: he was a therapist for me, and he helped me me to  canalize my complex emotions. He and I shared passions for books: so our discussion gave me the base for feeling OK in the workplace. I also started renting on my own; I choose a cheap place near the office that also was a kind of “cave” since it had few sunlight. However, this allowed me to save and create a “university fund”.

During my time at this insurance company, I discovered that hardwork paid off. I began learning as much as I could about data science, and coding. In a couple of years I was able to automate practically all the job reports and analytics of all things we did in the team. I knew that always giving more than what is asked, taking initiatives, and innovate always paid off.

For the first time in my life, I was able to be comfortable and stop running away of places where I saw repeatedly the same people. By the same time, I started having the idea of studying a master’s degree in an Ivy League. So daily without exception I started preparing myself for the GRE: I bought Kaplan, Manhattan, and all possible guides. 

I did the GRE after 6 months preparation and I got 163 Quant. I felt it was not enough, so I started preparing myself harder. At the same time, after 6 months, I applied for Fullbright scholarship. I passed the first filter, which was having a good GRE, resume, letter of recommendations, and grades. However, the second and last filter was a 20 minute interview: I was so nervous that I did not sleep the night before. When I was in the interview, they asked me out-of-context questions that confused me and made me flop. So I was rejected from it. However, their rejection did not stopped me. I decided to apply for an online version of an Ivy League program who grants the exact same degree as on campus, has the same acceptance rate, has the exact same professor giving the exact same curriculum, and is not an “extension school” or something like that. 

For my surprise, I was accepted, and I did not even had to do the second GRE. The only problem was: how do I pay it? I had been saving in my university fund by staying in cheap places and not spending a lot in things that are lot necessary. Also, the pandemic at that time, helped me avoiding going out and spend my money in alcohol or dates/ hotels/ etc.

I decided to move to a new job of a financial software provider that is the largest of the world. I was going to get as a consultant of the software in the credit risk side. After around 6 interviews I got the job and got a 100% paycheck increase. Also, I was second place for getting into BlackRock as a quant analyst but lost the job to an Imperial College master graduate in Financial Engineer. So I did not have up and decided to apply to the next position that opens that is similar to that. In the mean time, my job consisted of configuring the software for clients such that they can compute their credit risk. 

This job made me have a lot of new and good friends. This was the first time that I had good friends in a place where I work regularly. However, the problem was that I won their respect not for who I am, but for my abilities of conquering women in the nightclubs when we went out. By that I time I started to feel alone, lonely, and trying to find a deeper purpose; something related to what I had in Ireland. So I began to be open to have my first true relationship anytime soon.

When I started this new job, I started studying in this Ivy League program. I was taking one course at a time, such that I would be able to pay it: I could not possibly be able to stop working and committed full time to study. So I decided to study part time and work full time. This would take me 3.3 years, and it would take back 1.5 years back of my life that I lost while I was in addition and studying to get into CIDE.

I saw this opportunity of studying in Ivy League program as a way to vindicate myself: so I put every fibre of my being into my studies. This meant stop going out, working extra hard every weekend, stop social life, etc. I was able to get 4.0 in all my courses. I only had vacations of two weeks every 4 months. So this felt like a marathon. My masters was in computer science.

So I worked 1.5 years in this new company. I liked working with my new friends, but I wanted to be inside the code, not on the outside. So I asked my manger to help me with the transition. There he said: you need to have contacts, be the best, bla bla bla. Even though I was overachieving due to the grades that I was given, we was puting barriers. One month after that, a new position opened in the competition; this was to precisely what I wanted. So I applied, and, after six months and 5 interviews that asked me about programming, math, and finance, I was able to get the job of my dreams. This position was called: financial engineer. This company was just one month after that bought by one of the stock markets in the US. So, basically, I am working as a Quant of a Wall Street company with an Ivy League degree fully funded by myself.

I also found love and I al going to be married next year. So life gets much better if you keep trying and adopt the lemma: ad astra per aspera.

I wrote this last part very quickly since I am currently living it. Also, I extremely simplified everything and just told a high level view of what I lived.

Thanks for reading it so far, and I would appreciate your comments.

He is not nursing for milk (although he might get an oz or two while he does) but is just doing it for comfort.. I have always had a low supply, and when he was still on formula he was combo fed. We have almost completely eliminated bottles. Occasionally (mostly when he didn't eat much during the day) he will want a bottle in the middle of the night, which we now do whole milk. 
The big problem is that he refuses to sleep unless I am there to nurse him. I have tried to have my MIL and my BIL babysit him and it goes amazing and he loves them, until it's bed/nap time. They try everything and he just refuses to sleep, and if he gets tired enough just screams and screams because he wants boob. Even when his dad tries to put him to bed. 
I don't mind breastfeeding for the most part. But recently I have started to feel extremely touched out when he wants to spend 1/2 the night latched and has a fit if i try to just cuddle him, pat his back, back rubs, massage his scalp, etc.. And the other issue is I just want to be able to have a ""mommy morning"" and run errands, maybe go to the thrift store and get a coffee, without having to be back by a certain time just to get him down for a nap. Last night my partner and I went out for his sisters birthday and we came home to our son wide awake. BIL had tried to get him to sleep and he refused, so instead of dealing with the tantrum just hung out with him and played (I don't blame him)

I wanna stay out of the craziness for the most part, while still being able to get around to as many sights/attractions I can. I also like being close to a lot of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, etc. and highly favor cleaner and safer areas. I’ve settled on hotels in what seems like the SoHo, Tribeca, and East Village areas. I’m trying to keep my nightly stay to around $400-$500 or less which brought me to these five hotels, in no order:

1. Soho Grand
2. The Roxy
3. Smyth Tribeca
4. The Standard East Village
5. Public Hotel

I’d like to see, if any of you have stayed at one or some of these, would have a favorite out of this list. Other recommendations are welcome; but I’m trying to make a decision sooner than later lol. Also wondering if I made the right choice on neighborhoods as well. Thanks for any help!!",1,1746724590.0,travel,3,1.0,False
1khvkyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1khvkyb/am_i_the_a_hole_for_deleting_my_nieces_graduation/,Am I the A Hole for deleting my nieces graduation Pictures.,"Context I 30 F and my niece 19 F which I will name myself and her. Diana and Denise.
My sister Eliot now 38F had my niece Denise when she was only 18, so growing up during my teen years when I was like 14-16 even later on or whichever I had to babysit my niece quite often because my sister wasn't over her party phase. Even well into her 20s mid and late she would lie about having to at work late. She would go to bars and hang out with guys and go on several dates. Luckily at some point of the night she would be home to sleep or put the kids to bed.
I will note that one year she moved in with my mom and I and she made me share a room with her two kids so she could have privacy and have alone time with her boyfriend. 

My mom would always tell her something but never enforced it as she woukd say I would rather have the kids be safe with me than with someone else. And to note she was always playing the sick card that her head hurts so much. And I would have to be the one watching my niece and my nephew but mostly my niece.

I would always call her my sister on her bs but she would put the victim card on the table and act as if it never happened or make me fill guilty for calling her out.

Luckily she is much better now, she does go out still probably will still prefer it over having to parent but she is now become somewhat of a better mother.

Anywhoo, somewhere along the lines my niece grew up to be stubborn, spoiled and more worried about her looks and boys, boys boys. 

She currently lives with my mom and I until she finishes high school because she likes this district better. (She graduates in 3 weeks) I live with my mom because she did get heavly I'll and almost died so I stay to help her with bills and I drive her places. Luckily we have alot of land and I am not ashamed of being here. 

For more context, I am.a jewelry designer, a photographer and I also design clothes and punk jackets that do pretty well at my vendor gigs. As of maybe 2 years ago I have tried to get my niece interested in at least photography. I've told her if one day I'm sick she could take over and make some money when I am out. Or I have her help me with the vendor gigs and I'll pay her for the help. I also work at a clinic Monday through Friday.

She doesn't always help and hardly I woukd say. But on other days i also invite her out to eat, I take her to the plushy arcade. I'll get her starbucks and so on. 

One thing to note about her is that she also can get very annoying and she knows it. She likes to scare people and play pranks. She presses a certain buttons and she won't stop messing with you. And it's like she thrives on seeing you over the edge and mad.

So fast forward past all our drama and arguing over the year and so on.
Since she is fixing to graduate I spoke to her very nicely on how I would love if she goes to her prom. Because this is something that she would remember for a long time.
And me and her mom were coordinating a time for me to take her dress shopping.
Before my niece agreed to go dress shopping. Of course, she argued a lot about how she wasn't going to be going to prom. Her mother ended up convincing her.
Finally took her to get a dress. And I told her as a gift for her graduating school at barely passing. That is anyway. I told her that I will take her graduation pictures and she could make those her prom photos as well.

Well, I ended up scheduling last Sunday to get them done.And of course she threw a huge tantrum with her mother and she threw a huge Tantrum with me and my best friend Ralph, who By the way, is like an uncle to her and does a lot of things for her as well.
She threw a tantrum because she wanted these expensive nails done at the salon. My sister nicely told her that because she is planning a graduation party for her Plus paid a $100 on her prompt ticket. She couldn't afford these expensive nails. But she would be more than happy to get her some cheaper ones. Or that she has a machine that would make press on nails least 2 weeks.

My niece didn't like to be told that she couldn't get the nails of her choice And got very upset and told me that she didn't want any photos and that I could forget about it.

In the end I did convince her to get them done. Because I told her that she would regret it when she gets older and it would be really something nice for her to look back on.

As when I was in high school, my mom didn't have the money to get any pictures of me. So I wanted to do something nice for her.

So last Friday I was helping an emo cover band to sell merch at our local zoo for an event called feast with the Beast. I had to carry a whole cart full of my own stuff to sell plus a table and a generator and lights all by myself not including the merchandise I was going to be selling.
On Saturday, same thing as my sister was holding a vendor market at her job and she begged for me to come.

By Sunday, I was extremely tired as I also have a 40 hour a week job.

But I still managed to take my niece's pictures on Sunday in downtown and I also took her out for dinner, and we went to the plushie arcade.

Fast forward to Tuesday and Wednesday. She had to stay after school both days, to make up hours. And of course, she asked me to pick her up. Which I did. She did wait for me as I have to wait till I get clocked off at work. And since we are going through new processes at work. I had to stay a little later than usual to sign some paperwork so that I don't lose my job.

When I picked her up, I was a hot mess. My hair was undone. My legs were ashy. I was wearing house clothing.
I was very tired indeed. And I also work from home some days, and this happened to be one of those days.

My mom had to go out of town. So me and her were the only ones at home and I asked her nicely, if she would get down at the store to grab some things to make a salad.

She did, with first throwing some huffs and puffs.

That same night I was going to be planning on editing her photos, which would be Wednesday, May 7th. So I decided that I would get some coffee and since I'm having issues with one of my car windows, I didn't really want to go in the drive through. 
I asked her as nice as possible if she would be okay with getting down to get the coffee for me. Since I am clearly embarrassed to go out into public Looking the way I did that day.

That's where all hell went loose. She started going ape s*** crazy and she started yelling at me and throwing things in the car and she started accusing me that I'm  treating her like a slave.

She told me that getting me a few things at the store already was enough. I told her that those meal items were for the both of us. So I could make both of us dinner.

She yelled back telling me that she didn't care that she doesn't like whatever I bought. Not to mention she lost my credit card. The previous day when I got her Starbucks.

So I sat in the parking lot, asking her to calm down and that I was only asking a simple favor and that it was not okay to throw it in my face. All the things that she supposedly  done for me in the past. Because she indeed was yelling. Any little thing that she thought she had done for me.
She started laughing in my face, claiming that I was only mad at her because She didn't get down for the coffee.

And that honestly hurt my feelings because I like to do things out of the kindness of my heart without throwing it back at someone else's face that I did this or that for them. And I wasn't upset that she didn't get down for the coffee. I was upset because she was throwing up my face. Everything that she claims to have done for me. If you're gonna do something out of the kindness of your heart, just do it without telling someone in the future everything that they done.

I clearly told her this and I clearly told her that she didn't hear me telling her back all the other nice things that I had done for her in the past. 
I mean, I let her use my car when she wants to go to the gas station or when she wants to go to the store things like that.

If not, I always drive her.

There's so much much much much much more that I have done for her.

She yelled back at me telling me that she didn't ask for me to do those things for her. She never asked for me to buy her dinner all those times

She yelled at me that she didn't even ask for graduation pictures and that me and her mom are forcing her to go to prom.

She even started yelling that my friend. Ralph doesn't do anything for her even though any time She wants to go to her mom's house, which is a 45 minute drive from mine, he always takes her. He is also a hair stylist. He's always doing her hair and he was going to do it for prom as well.

She was complaining about everyone and everything.

On the way back home she refused to pur her seat belt on. 

When I got home I started to put the groceries away and I started to wash a few dishes so I could get dinner started. After washing a few dishes I went outside to speak with my mom to tell her what happened.

When I came back in the house to finish where I left off. I turned the faucet on for the sink there's a hose attached to it. It So happened to be turned on randomly that I got my whole face and top of my shirt wet.

Obviously, I knew it was my niece trying to play a prank on me.

She just happened to be in the kitchen. Eating an instant soup and she went crazy on me. Yelling, profusely that it wasn't her. 

So When the water got me wet, she blamed me for getting some water in her soup. She started pushing me, she threw her soup all over the floor and she got the bottle of windex and she sprayed some on my face.

I told her that some water compared to a chemical did not compare and she ended up breaking the bottle, spilling it all over the floor.

She tried to push me and she grabbed my wrist and I slapped her wrist so that she could get off of me and then she tried to hit me.

I called her mother after which she wasn't surprised but but also did not give me much reassurance.

I later heard the both of them talking over the phone about what happened. She was giving her mother a sob story about how she has finals coming up and some few tests that need to be done.
Yet, not once during this time has she even studied. She always says she doesn't ever have any homework.

And she's always on the phone speaking with her friends over video chat talking the most ridiculous nonsense.
Not once actually this year. Have I ever seen her study for anything?

And if you told her so she would get upset. Claim, nobody was there to help her with school work.

So I told her I was gonna be deleting her graduation pictures because she was very unappreciative. And very spoiled and conceited.

She yelled at me some more saying she didn't ask for these pictures to be taken.

So I am going to be deleting these photos.

And I decided from now on. I am not going to be doing any favors for her and I won't be taking her to school for her graduation practices. She'll need to figure that on her own.

And she asked me for help to get her nails done and I decided I will not be helping her out with that either.

So would I be the A hole for deleting her photos? 
Thanks for all your advice.

PS I have also spoken to my mother that she'll need to be kicked out of the house as soon as she graduates and go back to live with her mom.",1,1746724559.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

From my first use, I could tell this machine was built with precision. It encapsulates everything one would hope for from a device that bridges convenience with the promise of rich coffee flavors. As a coffee enthusiast, having this machine nestled in my kitchen has been a game-changer.

**Design and Build: Sleek yet Functional**  
Visually, the white exterior of this product beautifully complements any kitchen aesthetic. Its slim dimensions of 16.9""D x 5.5""W x 12.4""H mean it can easily fit into a compact space, ideal for city apartments or offices with limited space. The buttons for operation are straightforward, ensuring a smooth user experience even for beginners like my niece, who recently learned how to make lattes on it. It's also lightweight, tipping the scales at just 8.8 pounds, which turned out to be perfect for me as I occasionally shift my coffee setup between the kitchen and my home office.  

**Versatile Brewing Options**  
What impressed me most was the sheer versatility of the brewing settings. Whether I'm in the mood for an 8 oz. coffee during long work hours or craving a quick shot of double espresso between meetings, it caters to every preference. Additionally, it's capable of brewing six cup sizes ranging from single-serve espresso to an 18 oz. cup. This feature made it a hit during a family gathering last weekend when everyone wanted coffee their own way.  

**See Nespresso ENV120WAE price on Amazon.**

**Key Benefits**  
- Quickly brews at the touch of a button, thanks to its fully automatic operation.  
- Comes with a reusable filter, making it eco-friendlier compared to machines needing disposable filters.  
- The Aeroccino Milk Frother is a standout addition, producing smooth hot or cold froth in mere seconds.  

**Performance: Robust Yet Effortless Coffee**  
Daily use has revealed just how well this machine performs. On mornings when I’m rushing out the door, its 25-second heat-up time ensures I don’t leave without my much-needed caffeine fix. Each brew delivers coffee with an impeccable crema that rivals what I'd get at professional cafes. It even switches to energy-saving mode automatically, which aligns perfectly with my efforts to reduce my carbon footprint.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Setting up this machine was simple. The accompanying app was an unexpected bonus, allowing me to connect it via Bluetooth to track brewing stats, order capsules, or troubleshoot. However, maintenance requires a bit of patience. Occasionally, the water tank's shape makes cleaning a challenge, especially if any residue builds up after prolonged use. My solution has been sticking to a regular cleansing routine.

**Adverse Aspects**  
- Louder than anticipated during operation. It wasn’t drastic, but a noticeable hum filled the room during brewing, which my partner found distracting, especially during late-night coffee adventures.  
- The manual locking mechanism feels different and requires some effort. Compared to other models with pop-up lids, this might seem cumbersome to a casual user.  

**Competitive Options in the Coffee Machine Market**  
When I compared this coffee maker to competitors like the Keurig K-Café or the Breville Bambino Plus, a few distinctions stood out. The Keurig is impressively intuitive but doesn’t offer as rich a crema or the variety in cup sizes. Meanwhile, Breville's Bambino Plus provides professional-grade performance but feels bulkier and is priced higher. The Nespresso Vertuo Next strikes a middle ground offering better espresso flavors than the Keurig and easier handling than Breville.  

**Smart Spending**  
Given the features and premium results, this product presents excellent value without breaking the bank. While it’s not the highest-end gadget, its ability to cater to espresso enthusiasts and coffee lovers alike provides a worthy return on investment. It's clear any savings achieved over morning coffee shop runs stack up quickly.

1khvf2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1khvf2d/aio_about_buying_a_couplebottles_of_cider/,AIO about buying a couple?bottles of cider,"T.L.;D.R. at the end.

So I'm a 25 year old male and yesterday I bought a couple of bottles of cider (Strongbow) which I haven't had in almost a year (also I drink alcohol once or twice a month and usually keep it at one or two beers). 

It was after work on a hot Wednesday evening after getting dogfood and I passed through the alcohol aisle. I saw the ciders (remembered that I liked them and hadn't taken one since last year) and bought two of them. I got home and one of my brothers saw the bottles and told me it wasn't good that I bought them mid-week. I asked why, he said it just wasn't right, I replied again why? And he stated it just wasn't and left. I ignored him and opened one in my room as read a book. 

Almost three hours passed and I was sent to do some errands, I came back they (my family) ordered pizza and we had dinner. After they all left I took another slice and went up thinking ""this will go well with the other bottle"", so I did just that.

An hour later I was playing on my laptop when one of them barges in and starts pestering me in ways a brother knows how to. I ignored him and kept playing, then he spotted both bottles and told me I was becoming an alcoholic. I asked why would that make me an alcoholic since I drink very little whenever I go out (2-4 beers a month) and he drinks a lot more. The argument was that it was a Wednesday night.

For extra context, I work and study. This week I no longer have to go to the office and all my classes are after 2 pm.

The other brother came in, they started to lecture me and I just turned them out, asked them to leave and went to sleep.

This morning I started working early because I had stuff to do later in the evening (meeting friends for coffee on campus aside from taking my classes), and so I didn't have much time to do anything including throwing away the trash from the previous night (just the two bottles and a napkin). 

My mother came into my room about two hours later to check up on me whilst I was finishing a report and saw the bottles, asked what they were, told her it was cider and she got mad saying we needed to talk.

Here's when I got mad. I'm an introvert, she's not. If I don't go out, she gets mad and ropes me into whatever nonsense she wants. If I want to go out (with friends or for a drive on my own around the city), she gets mad and says we (I) need to save (I spend about 5 bucks on food and gas whenever I go out), or that I go out too much (when I was in highschool I had little to no friends and even less time/opportunities to go out with them).

One of my brothers even stated next time he was going to find me ""cleaning baby powder"" because I hadn't done it in a while instead of alcohol (I don't do drugs). And the part I find hypocritical is that a couple of months ago he invited me to a sports bar to watch a game, he ordered 3 yards each and got mad at me when I threw up because I don't drink that much even after I told him that. I know should have told him no but he was going through a rough patch in his relationship (they broke up a week ago btw) and I wanted to make him feel better bay agreeing to a plan he made for just the two of us (he is the one I get along with the most).

Again, I'm 25, I work, I study (long story), I drink once or twice a month. And the way I see it is as though I wanted to eat a candy after almost a year of not eating it. 

T.L.;D.R.: I bought two bottles of Strongbow cider after almost a year of not having any on a Wednesday evening, didn't drink them until night time. I drink a couple of beers once or twice a month. And my entire family already pictures me as an alcoholic.",1,1746724154.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

1khvdcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1khvdcg/new_nanny_constantly_making_excuses_to_take_off/,New nanny constantly making excuses to take off work,"Hi all, we just hired a nanny and need some advice about whether we should continue with our nanny or start looking elsewhere. She is very nice, and she has given us multiple gifts, so we feel bad to even consider this. The main issue is that she seems to be the unluckiest person in existence. 

Over the course of just 4 weeks, she has had the following excuses:

1. Food poisoning
2. Flat tire (though strangely didn't miss work for this one)
3. Kidney stones
4. Bad cold sore flare-up (we both agreed to take 2 weeks off unpaid)
5. Uncle died
6. Husband took a heart attack

So, overall, she has worked maybe 5 or 6 days for us this month. It's getting weird, and we need to do our day jobs.

Independent of the reliability issue, we're not feeling very comfortable for multiple reasons:

1. She was kissing the baby on the head/cheek the first couple of days until we told her to stop. She did stop when we asked her, but maybe we shouldn't have had to say this in the first place. She had cold sores in the past, and although she didn't have an active one at the time, she should know instinctively not to do this. 
2. Her attention to details is poor and is generally clumsy. We noticed soap bubbles left in the baby bottles twice. She spilled her water bottle and told us it was a small amount (the carpet was still wet the next day, so we now know how much was actually spilled). She gets extremely out of breath running around the house or going up stairs, and it makes her seem frantic, almost, which scares us. Do we want a clumsy person carrying our baby?
3. She can't do basic math. We want her to use a scale to measure formula powder because we noticed her scoops are wildly inconsistent, but she's unable to figure ""how grams work"" or use a calculator. She struggles with basic technology like phone apps and remembering her passwords, etc.
4. She is forgetful. Almost every day she has forgotten something at home or forgotten to take them home (glasses, water bottle, house shoes, etc.). We let her leave stuff here now so she doesn't forget. Yesterday she was running around looking for her glasses for 10 minutes and realized they were in her pocket.
5. She's a weird mixture of pushy with certain things we don't want to do, but then asks for permission for every little obvious thing when we're trying to get work done.
6. On her first day of work, she started ranting about Trump for a while and we had to tell her that we're just not that into politics and don't want to discuss it. We didn't even disagree with her, but it was just uncomfortable.
7. We are not sure she is capable of doing a full 8 hour day. She's a bit older and gets out of breath, and we noticed that by the 7th hour she's having trouble staying focused. 
8. One time, I overheard her whisper to herself, ""I can't do this"", which was very alarming and strange to me. I don't even know what she was referring to. I asked her if she was alright, but she said she was fine and acted normally.
9. She asked us for a cup of coffee, but we only have tea in the house. It's a small request, and it's not about the $0.50 it costs, but if she needs coffee to do her job, shouldn't she just bring that with her or have it before she comes in? It's a 10:00 start time.

Keep in mind that these issues, and others I've omitted for brevity, occurred over just the few days she's actually showed up. A lot of these are not a big deal, or are fixable and/or have already been fixed, but taken together, do they not paint a picture?

We don't want to be cruel and add to her suffering by firing her, but at a certain point we have to wonder who exactly we've really hired... Even if there's only a 20% chance of her having some kind of mental issues, are we comfortable taking that chance with our baby? Are we wrong for feeling that way? Should we give her another week, yet again? Do we dare ask for proof of any of this? Should we just continue with her but interview for backup care?",5,1746724033.0,Nanny,16,0.73,False

1khvc32,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bulletpulley01/comments/1khvc32/why_bullet_pulley_is_the_perfect_mothers_day_gift/,Why Bullet Pulley is the Perfect Mother’s Day Gift.,"Mother’s Day is that special time of year when we pause to celebrate the incredible women who raised us, supported us, and continue to inspire us. While flowers and breakfast in bed are lovely gestures, there’s something more meaningful about giving a [**Mother's Day Gift**](https://bulletpulley.com/) that aligns with her goals, energizes her lifestyle, and shows that you truly see her not just as a mom, but as the strong, dynamic individual she is.

This year, instead of defaulting to the usual scented candles or spa vouchers, think about giving her something that speaks to both her strength and her self-care: the Bullet Pulley.

# More Than a Gift A Game-Changer for Her Fitness Journey

Let’s be honest, modern moms wear a thousand hats. Between managing work, home, kids, and everything in between, time is a luxury. But one thing that often gets pushed down her priority list is her own health and fitness.

That’s where the [**Bullet Pulley**](https://bulletpulley.com/) steps in. Compact and insanely effective, it’s the kind of workout gear that adapts to her life, not the other way around. Whether she’s a fitness beginner, a seasoned gym-goer, or someone just trying to squeeze in a workout between Zoom calls and dinner prep, this piece of equipment makes resistance training accessible, simple, and genuinely enjoyable.

# Strength Without the Commute

One of the biggest barriers to regular workouts for busy moms? Getting to the gym. It’s not just the workout itself, it's the time spent commuting, waiting for machines, navigating crowded spaces. The Bullet Pulley eliminates all of that.

Set it up at home with just a rack and the pulley attached and she’s got a complete resistance workout system at her fingertips. No bulky machines, no need for ten different dumbbells. Just one piece of equipment that does it all.

# Empowerment in Her Hands

Fitness is about more than how we look, it's about how we feel. And one of the most powerful feelings for a woman, especially a mom, is reclaiming a sense of control over her body.

Giving her the Bullet Pulley isn’t just handing her a fitness tool. It’s handing her confidence. Energy. Time for herself. A reminder that she deserves to feel strong and capable and that taking care of herself isn’t selfish, it's essential.

There’s something deeply empowering about feeling your muscles fire, seeing progress week after week, and knowing you did that on your own terms. This gift gives her that experience daily.

# A Gift That Says, “I See You”

At the end of the day, what makes the Bullet Pulley the [**perfect Mother’s Day gift**](https://bulletpulley.com/products/bullet-pulley-pro?variant=51678786453814) isn’t just its physical benefits. It’s the message behind it.

It says, “I see how hard you work.” It says, “I care about your health and happiness.” It says, “Your strength matters.”

And honestly? Moms need to hear that more often.

We often talk about giving thoughtful gifts. But what’s more thoughtful than helping her prioritize herself?

# Wrap-Up: Give Her the Gift of Strength

Mother’s Day doesn’t have to be about temporary gestures. It can be about creating moments that last. A [**morning workout**](https://bulletpulley.com/products/bullet-pulley-pro) with coffee by the window. Ten minutes of movement before the chaos of the day begins. A reminder, every time she pulls that cable, that she’s powerful beyond measure.

So this year, go beyond the ordinary. Skip the roses and reach for something that will remind her daily of how capable and strong she is because that’s what she’s been showing you all along.

1khvbmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1khvbmj/aitah_for_wanting_to_uninvited_my_boyfriend_from/,AITAH for wanting to uninvited my boyfriend from my cousin’s wedding?,"okay so to start out I (26F) have only been dating my boyfriend (31M) for about 5 months. He had always been sweet and outgoing, could hold a conversation with anyone, and got along with my family well! He’s just all around fun to spend time with so when i received the invitation to my cousin’s wedding with the option for a plus one i figured i’d bring him! 

fast forward to this last month and things have been a bit stressful between us. long story short i’ve been a bit overwhelmed. i’m in the middle of an extensive interview process for a position at a fairly prestigious school, had been dog sitting for a friend and the pup, while such a cutie with the best of intentions, was quite a handful, and i also have a fairly busy schedule in general (two weekly social commitments plus serving at my church, a full time job, and frequent other family and friend obligations). He is also quite busy as he has a full time job that requires lots of over time, he is starting a small side business growing vegetables with his father on a farm about an hour away, and also has a large garden to tend to at home (spring is a busy time for gardening/farming), as well as his own social obligations. 

we got in a pretty big fight one night because i had been a bit snappy with my tone while trying to study for the exam i was required to take for the interview while the dogs (i also have a dog and cat) were going crazy. he didn’t appreciate it as he’s made it clear he is not okay with me having a tone with him and so he ended up yelling at me. i told him i was going to bed, i didn’t have the mental capacity for an argument that late at night. he followed me in my room and i asked him to give me space and sleep in the spare room because i really needed to keep myself calm and centered for the first phase of this interview in the morning. he got angry and began trying to fight but i told him im going to bed so he left. the next morning he came over and woke me up at 6am to give me a coffee and try to patch things up but i wasn’t really happy about it as i had told him i don’t have the mental capacity for this at the moment. he ended up calling me a derogatory term for women which he knows i am not okay with, and then he left. this felt like a huge red flag and we both decided we needed to step back and reevaluate our relationship. 

well, that was a week or so ago and we’ve talked and mainly mended things since then but are still being cautious. since the argument though, i had been feeling conflicted about bringing him to my cousin’s wedding in two weeks. today i asked about a baseball game we were planning to go to for his sibling’s birthday and he said he had given my ticket to a friend so the friend could bring a girl he had started seeing instead because he wasn’t sure where we stood at the time. it did hurt my feeling but i couldn’t be too upset because again, i’d already been considering uninviting him from the wedding. i’m still feeling conflicted though, would i be the asshole for uninviting him? 

*i’d like to add before we judge him for his reaction (while i am not saying it was okay) my tone really was quite uncalled for even if i didn’t mean for it to be taken personally, it was quite rude. 

AND if i uninvite him, there’s a good chance i’d bring some else (just a girl friend) since he’s already been factored into the cost for food ",4,1746723914.0,AmItheAsshole,17,1.0,False

I’m in my mid 20s. Graduated nursing. 
I moved here in the States 2 years ago from Iloilo. 

Originally I’m born in the States but I was given away to my aunts and uncles for them to raise me from newborn to college. My biological parents are here in houston. We have a difficult relationship, hence one the reasons why I want to venture out. 

I haven’t fully acclimated to life here in the states. My boyfriend is hispanic so I mostly interact with his family. I’m still kind of scared of driving around Tx because of the traffic and houston drivers lmao so that leaves me to be secluded at my apartment sometimes. I work at a small surgical facility with not so many Filipino.

I’m very fluent in hiligaynon and some kinaray’a. I miss iloilo. I dream about it everyday night. I miss the kayle humor. I miss my friends at home. I do have friends here but mostly non-filipino.

I am a first time mom and trying to prep for my baby's first year (currently 3mo). I found some similar posts here and there and thought I'd share my list in case it helps anyone. I would also super appreciate any recs from others! I've asked for recs from friends but otherwise don't know what I don't know.



Here is what I got so far over the past few months  
**Feeding:**

\- high chair (these are surprisingly expensive! I heard Ikea has one for lower cost)

\- wipeable mat for under high chair

\- toddler plates, bowls, utensils, snack cups

\- sippy cups/cups with straws/cups that transition to sippy cups/cups that look like regular cups but spill proof (I have no idea what baby will prefer)



**Health & Safety:**

\- infant tylenol and ibuprofen (note ibuprofen cannot be used until a certain age and to check expirations)

\- infant mylicon

\- boogie wipes/nasal aspirator/nasal saline

\- humidifier

\- costco bandaids

\- hand sanitizer and masks for parents

\- infant/toddler toothbrush and toothpaste (for when they're old enough)

\- teething toys

\- car seats for 12mo + (I was advised to get one for each car as they do not come out easily)

\- child lock stuff, furniture mounting stuff

\- stair gate

\- prenatals for mom, fish oil for mom, vitamin d supplement for baby (breast feeding)

\- emergency/back-up formula both in ready made and powder (I only got a small amount as sometimes I need to supplement with formula, also some friends milk supply dropped once returning to work and did not recover), we give baby a bottle of pumped milk every other day or so to keep her used to bottles

\- still need toddler safe sunblock, UV blocking clothes? 

 

**Hygiene:**

\- waterwipes (love costco for this) or preferred wipes

\- diapers size up to 4 (most friends said they at least went up to 4 before potty training)

\- we use baby Aquaphor as both preventative for diaper rash and treatment and it works well for us, this can also be used on wounds, dry skin, dry lips etc for adults too

\- hypoallergenic baby soap/shampoo

\- trying to look if there is a recommended stain remover for clothes

\- hypoallergenic laundry detergent (her doc recommended All)

\- scent and dye free soap for washing bottles/baby stuff

\- maybe should get a potty training seat?

  


**Fun (this is where I am lacking):**
Edit: all the recs for toys has made me feel so much better! I swear social media makes one feel like baby need all these things and I was worried I wasn’t prepping enough in this category but seems baby will baby 

I read many toy companies may go out of business, baby is just started to get bored and I am seeing the value of toys... any recommendations are appreciated. So far:

\- play pen with mat 

\- outdoor mat that could double as a portable mat for indoors

\- activity gym

\- activity center (I read the ones where they can walk is not as recommended and to go for the ones that stay in place, I went with skip hop)

\- bath toys

  


**Travel:**

\- cheaper travel stroller that is light and easy to move

\- portable sound machine

\- baby carrier

\- stroller cover for if it rains

\- forgot to mention passport for baby in case we need to leave, good for 5 years 

  


**Daycare:**

baby will be starting in a few months and I have no idea what to prep for, should I get a backpack to pack baby's things? we have bottles and a bottle bag

  


**Misc:**

\- clothes in bigger sizes, they're inexpensive now but who knows as most are not made in the US

\- shoes unfortunately I heard will get expensive but no idea what size she will be so haven't gotten

\- just realized I should probably get bigger socks

\- furniture to help with organizing/storing things

\- sleep sack (again no idea what baby will prefer unfortunately for weaning from swaddle), I got the woolino on sale because it is sized up to 2 years, it is pricey but hopefully will last long

\- photo album and external hard drive for storing photos

\- recipe book

\- pumping bra

\- may need to splurge on a wearable pump as my commute is long :( would love any recs

\- milk storage bags

\- coffee for parents



This is what I got so far! Some was given second hand by friends with older kids, found on FB marketplace or various sales. Keep in mind some places also give discounts for using their registry. This list doesn't include the things I had/have already for the newborn stage, happy to share this if anyone is expecting.

I can't tell whether I'm being mean or judgemental or whether I should give this guy a chance. 

I matched with a guy M36 on Tinder and we messaged backwards and forwards for a few weeks. We moved to WhatsApp so he started coming up as a friend suggestion on Facebook. I clicked on his profile and discovered that he had a fiancé who passed away a few years ago. It must have been a long distance and/or online relationship as he is based in the UK and the woman was in the US. I could see that for a few years he posted happy birthday messages to her posthumously on her birthday, which happens to only be a few days after mine. I felt pretty uncomfortable finding that out about him prematurely, because it's not my business, but I guess curiosity got the better of me when I saw him as a suggestion on Facebook. Back on WhatsApp, we were talking about star signs and he asked me when my birthday is. I told him the date and he replied 'phew - I thought you were going to say it was a few days later'. With guilt and trepidation, I replied 'why, would that have been a problem?' to which he responded 'oh it would be the same day as my Mum's birthday, that's all"". I thought it was a strange coincidence that his Mum and his late fiancé had the same birthday, but I didn't dwell on it. 

We went on a first date a few days after this exchange. The first thing I noticed is that his hair was a completely different colour than in his profile pictures. In his pictures he has dark brown hair but in person he had bleach blonde highlights. I commented on this and he told me on New Year's Eve he'd randomly decided to dye his own hair in his bathroom and all his profile pictures were a few years old. He was wearing a leather jacket that he told me was his Mum's. He seemed nervous and erratic and was quite intense. When we went to dinner and he took his jacket off I could see that his shirt was crumpled and unironed and he was generally unkempt. He told me that he hasn't been looking after himself for a few years because he's been through a difficult time. For instance, he said he'd recently had a filling because he'd been neglecting dental routines. I presumed that he was referring to the grief of losing his fiancé, which is something I shouldn't know, and I didn't say anything other than be kind, reassuring and told him he doesn't need to be nervous or justify himself to me, let's just enjoy getting to know each other etc. 

He then told me that his Mum is currently living with him because she had a series of strokes over a period of a decade. She's immobile, lives on the ground floor of his house and has carers come in several times a day. He works full time, pays a mortgage on the house he recently bought, so he can't be a full-time carer. Over the course of the date he told me several things that either set off alarm bells with me or made me want to ask follow-up questions once I know him better. He told me that he'd studied Maths, Further Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Biology A-levels (all the hard ones) and went to university to do a Science degree but didn't cope with being away from home and dropped out pretty quickly. He's been working in a warehouse ever since, doing night shifts as a supervisor. He doesn't drive (he lives in a town 45 minutes from me and I'd driven there for the date) but a neighbour parked in his allocated parking bay on his housing estate a few times, so he went out in the middle of the night with a knife and punctured their tyres. He has various brothers and sisters but he told me they stay away and don't bother to visit their Mum or help him with her. 

After getting food we went for a walk in the park, got coffee in a cafe and chatted. I was vacillating backwards and forwards about whether I was interested enough or felt enough of a spark to go on a second date. I was aware by this point that he'd had an extremely difficult time and I wasn't convinced he was emotionally available for dating. He kept talking as if meeting me was meant to be and was overly intense. He said his life was about to get more positive and change and that this was the best afternoon he'd had in a long time. I got the feeling he was projecting 'manic pixie dreamgirl' energy onto me. This all made me a bit uncomfortable as I certainly need more encounters than a first date to know whether I want to start a relationship with someone and, as is common with people on dating apps, I'm talking to multiple people and had other potential dates lined up. I gently reminded him that we've just met, let's see where things go without bringing premature expectations etc. He got overly excited that I knew the lyrics to Smiths songs and gazed at me for extended periods of time and said things like 'my god, you're so lovely'. There was one point when we were sat in a cafe and he stared at me for so long I thought he was going to kiss me but kept pulling back. That's when he told me that he'd once lost someone. I felt relieved that he mentioned it, because I felt so guilty of being aware of that. Eventually he walked me back to my car and asked if he could kiss me before I left. We kissed and it was actually a very hot kiss in the end. My feeling at the end of the date was that I would meet him again if he wanted to and we'd gently see where things go. I'm very busy in the month of May and have exams to sit for my job and my degree so I can't date heavily for a few more weeks anyway. 

We were messaging back and forth for a couple of days after that date. He sent me a poem he'd written about his life restarting again which, again, and I feel mean saying it, I found overly intense and premature. I reminded him over text again let's just take things steady and enjoy the process of dating. The next day after that he was quiet, but then he sent me a message saying he'd spent half the day in A&E. He said he'd woken up that morning with one side feeling numb and like he couldn't move properly and felt like he'd had a stroke. He said the hospital has referred him for some checks to ascertain whether he's had a mini stroke. He said he's off work for the week and will have to try to find a new job not involving night shifts. He messaged me earlier to say that he's been referred for some appointments in my town tomorrow and he'll be heading here on the train. I'm working from home tomorrow but I felt like he was angling for me to come meet him and maybe drive him around. His appointment is at midday so I explained that I can't skip out on work for the entire afternoon and that the earliest I could meet is probably 16:30, which would mean him waiting around in a one-horse town for hours. He said it's fine, he'll bring a book and wait, because he wants to see me. I wasn't expecting to spend my Friday evening that way and I have a lot of studying to catch up on this weekend. But I felt guilty for not agreeing to meet him when he's apparently having such a rough time and said ok I will drive into town after work. 

I'm just finding all these things odd. The fiance's birthday / Mum's birthday coincidence or white lie. He tells me about his Mum's strokes and literally a few days later he suspects that he himself has had a mini stroke. I've told him I'm super busy in May and can't drive to meet him for a while but now it just so happens that he's been sent for some appointments in my town, so he'll be 5 minutes away from me. 

Am I being incredibly harsh to harbour suspicions against a man who has been through a difficult time, or am I right to have an uncomfortable feeling about this in the pit of my stomach? I know that the late fiancé is real because I've seen pictures of them online, but as for everything else I only have his word for it, I've met the guy once and he seemed a bit unkempt, erratic and unstable. I feel like someone is trying to pull me into a messy situation and relationship against my better judgement and it's sparking off a running away instinct in me.

1khv0i4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1khv0i4/i_think_knitting_has_broken_my_8_year/,I think knitting has broken my 8 year relationship. 38M/38F,"Relationship Reddit, I think balls of yarn might have cost me my relationship.

My fiancé and partner of over 8 years has some pretty serious ADHD, and I love her for it. She's always doing something weird and quirky and is such an amazing artist. Sometimes she struggles from it, but I'm always there to support her and help her with things that are difficult for her. We're DINKs, live in our dream cabin on an off-grid farm that we built our selves, go on trips every year, we're both fit yoga enthusiast and surfers. I don't mean to brag but my fiance is GORGIOUS and we're both very blessed to not ""act our age"".

We've really been through some heavy shit to get here, but we're living the dream. Even after 8 years the romance, affection and sexual desire never let up. We get in trouble for PDA constantly, we cook for each other and eat candle light dinners and still find new ways to explore our desires with each other.

That was all until recently, when the love of my life discovered knitting. Knitting is obviously a prime candidate for stimming and hyperfixation in people with ADHD and it's grabbed her like a bear trap. Nearly every waking moment that isn't taken up by absolutely critically important tasks is spent knitting. Not only knitting, but she does it with noise cancelling headphones on watching her ASMR videos at the same time. It's like total sensory deprivation.

At first I was supportive of her new hobby. She always flitters around to different special interests at a pretty high rate so I was fine with just leaving her to it at first. She had a cool new thing to try, made me an awesome sweater, and was obviously really enjoying it. But her normal 2-3 week special interest cycle turned into 8-9 months now, and getting deeper and deeper into the knitting hole, and the ""fiber arts"" community (which seems super toxic oddly).

We used to take the time to sit together, hold hands and talk about our feelings and hopes and dreams, now I can't get a word out of her. We used to share all our common interest and get so stoked on a new surf movie, or a cool van, or just snuggle up and laugh at cat videos. Now it's like a stone wall. Just this morning I saw a racoon clip that made me snort my coffee. ""Hey babe, look at this trash panda!"" ""heh, yeah. funny..."" and didn't even look up. She stopped working out, going for runs, or really even getting off the couch. Sex and affection? Nonexistent. It went from like kinda weird if it had been more than a day or two, to MAYBE once, and she's SO locked in that any advances on my part are just blocked out and she of course never stops knitting, so I don't get anything coming my way. The other day I started holding and caressing her and kissing her neck, and she was fucking knitting behind me while I was doing that! So I stopped and she was just fixed, unblinkingly at her ASMR video while click-clacking away with her needles like nothing even happened.

At first I was concerned that she was really anxious or depressed. So in one of the few fleeting moments of attention I could get from her, I brought it up to check in on her. She seem flabbergasted like WTF was I talking about!? She say's she loves me, and she and us are doing great and I'm being weird, am I ok? Great, now I'm being gaslit by knitting. 

I know she does need an arts and crafts thing or she gets a little squirrelly. Pretty typical ADHD girl thing, but I love that about her. I also don't want to pull her up on this super hard and start a fight because she can react pretty poorly to that sometimes when she thinks she's being blindsided, but I can't employ any other strategy because she won't pay attention to the conversation because she's knitting. I could let it ride, but it's getting pretty rough just being alone constantly while she's lost in the void. Before she got locked into this I couldn't like, go out to the garage and work on my motorcycle with headphones on all weekend or she'd be sad. Am I supposed to just sit in the corner and be ignored now? That feels pretty shitty.

So what am I to do? Any other ADHD girls out there that know of a good way to broach this problem without it blowing up in my face?",2,1746723168.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

We have two kids (9 and 10) and the idea of actually leaving feels exhausting and scary on top of already being exhausted. 

Admittedly this is my second marriage, but my first only lasted 9 months and there weren't kids involved. And now I'm a lot older. with the kids, but at least I have a good paying, steady job. So much so I'm the breadwinner - I take home almost double what he does in a year. 

I feel like I've been dying a slow death within my marriage. Scraping together everyone's emotions all of the time, managing everything and my husband just floating along like I'm not drowning.  2 Months ago he spent the day in bed again moping because I didn't give him a reaction he wanted (even though he'll never admit it.) and I lost it.  I put the kids to bed and I told him I wasn't doing this anymore. I wasn't responsible for pulling him out of his pity party and I told him I wanted a divorce. He spent the next month ""fixing himself"" but it's all stuff I didn't care about, not really. He sold his guns, stopped smoking pot... started working out again. Would do some things he'd used to like leave me little notes or make coffee for me in the morning. But none of that fixes anything.   
he also stopped eating for two weeks and then did minimally start to eat. It caught up with him and he passed out, cracked his head open and ended up in the hospital for half a day. Did he learn from that? Nope. Just barely eats and can't fathom why I'm angry instead of concerned. The hospital visit wasn't lesson enough. People have made comments about how much he's lost in such a short period of time.  I feel like it's him trying to make me concerned enough to stay.   
He stopped taking antidepressants that he's been on for 10 years. Weened himself off without consulting his doctor and doesn't see how that would affect me or our kids... 

I think I've finally convinced myself it's over. It's not as black and white and there are so many other layers it's overwhelming to think about. But I think it will make me a better mom too. And be better all around for my kids.

1khuv0j,https://i.redd.it/lo5ww0xx6lze1.png,"""Amber brew Gesha""","Hi guys!

I'm not going to name any places, because I don't want to harass them or anything.

Anyways, last year I was on a cafe crawl during a day trip. After talking to a few locals at several different cafes, I was led to this place where they sold ""expensive but good coffee"". At that time I never had anything that was more expensive than what we sold at the roaster (first specialty coffee related job I had) I worked at, so I check it out. 

The place only sells Geshas. That already checks out price point for me.

But the place doesn't list what Geshas they're selling. 

It's a tier system, where I can choose from:  

A - $30 

B - $50

C - $100

D - $170

E - $300

These are prices for half a wine glass.   
I go with B because I know this is a one-off and why the hell not. 

Out comes this. 

Guy tells me it's an ""Amber brew"" he invented and I'm even more puzzled. It tasted good, like, a nice Strawberry note, but it reminded me of the staple Columbian Gesha we had at the roaster I worked at. Good but like. Not $50 good IMO.

What did I experience?? 

The thing has puzzled me every time I remind myself of it.

The counter made it so I couldn't see what the guy was doing, but I know he was using a french press.

I know Geshas are inherently expensive due to labor, care, scarcity and partially name value, but has anyone seen an operation like this? I had the aforementioned Columbia Gesha that was really nice, that we sold for 18 Euro per 250g bag, and the HIGHER END was 45 Euros for 250g. Since then, I've had 80 Euros for 150g, and 50 Euros for 200g.  
Each time I think, ""what the hell WAS that, then?"" And what I drank never came close to the others I had.

Also, does anyone know what this Amber brew could possibly be? Like, did this guy just brew 5 grams of Gesha in 88 degree water?  Is it just eccentric just to be eccentric? 

Again, I don't want to dunk on whatever the guy is doing, and people can have coffee however they want as long as they enjoy it and feel like it's worth their money. (This place also has pretty high reviews) I just have never seen this anywhere else, and it's been wracking my brain since. Even if it's just ""It's just expensive to be expensive"", I think I just need that confirmation.

This is more of a post I had to get out of my system, but I'd definitely love to hear what other people think.

i (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (25M) for a year now, when we started hanging out and going out, i genuinely didn’t think we’d end up dating, we were just hanging out, things started getting serious when he asked me to meet his mom; that’s when i knew, before this i was a very chill girl and i noticed a red flag but decided to ignore it, basically almost every time we were together he received calls from “(a girls name) mother” so i kept it in the back of my mind, when we got to dinner for the first time with his mother, he received another of this calls, after dinner i asked him for the first time, he said “it’s my exs mom, i don’t keep contact with her but i do with her parents” continued to explain and asked if i was ok with it, i explained that it was weird to me, but it was his choice in the end, two months after this he was having a birthday party at his house, when outside to welcome another friend and this other girls mom shows up, tells him she has a present, parks and the girl gets out of the car, they had a conversation (which seemed more like an argument) and comes back, i told him i was leaving, he tried to explain but i was mad and hurt so i left. This same night he calls me and asks for a conversation, after a while i agree to have a conversation another day. we have a conversation, he tells me that is not happening again and asks for forgiveness, i ended up saying yes but we should take things slower; a few days after he gets a notification from ANOTHER girl so i check his phone, i see that he has flirty conversations with her and that her ex contacted him 3 days after the party where they had the argument and go out for coffee, after this he blocked her and every family member, when i checked his phone i tell him all the things i found disrespectful and that i want to end things, he says he’s gonna change all of this and actually does, after all of this he became the most perfect partner for months, but i still feel some type of way sometimes, i get emotional and every little thing he does wrong, i remember the things he has done and i start a fight; i truly see a change and i don’t see the messy man that he was before, but i still find it hard to get over it, i love him and i know he loves me too, but im not mentally prepared to trust him enough, is it ok to move on or should we seek for help?",3,1746722758.0,AITAH,8,0.8,False
1khuu6r,https://i.redd.it/1xrw078i7lze1.jpeg,Fluctuating cholesterol & low(ish) DHEA with cystic acne,"*Disclaimer: I’m not asking for medical advice, nor will I interpret comments as medical advice. I also plan to see an endocrinologist.*

My most recent lipids panel just came back. All units are mg/dL. Currently, all numbers are considered in the normal range except my LDL, which I want to get to <100 as an initial win — and ideally down to mid range as a longer term goal. Comments describe high-level, key changes that I identified as most likely to impact my results.

Some numbers make sense to me: the direct correlation between my exercise and HDLs, and the LDL improvement with a decrease of trans/saturated fats from eating out.

However, I’m confused as to why my overall cholesterol and triglycerides would go *up* (which seems less than ideal) given that all my LDLs and HDLs have been trending in the right direction, which is supported by improvements in my exercise & diet.

Regarding diet, I know that dairy is a common culprit of cholesterol-spiking fats and cystic acne (which I also struggle with) — but my stomach doesn’t do dairy well so I have to minimize consumption unless I want to live in the bathroom. I have lactose-free dairy with my coffee in the morning … that’s my most regular consumption. Also, our meats are organic & hormone free 80% of the time. Probably a 60-40 split between white meat (chicken) and red meat (beef, sometimes pork but it’s rare).

Any thoughts on why this might be, especially when other members of my household have the same diet and their cholesterol is perfectly fine?

Additionally, I did a hormone panel for PCOS and everything came back normal — except my DHEA, which was at 39. The lab itself marked it the number as slightly low, but my doctor said it’s in the normal range per the standards at her clinic. She doesn’t see anything else that would be causing my cystic acne, so she’s sending me to an endo just to make sure she didn’t miss anything.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

## Key Features Analysis

The top water dispensers in 2025 are characterized by a blend of advanced technology, ergonomic design, and focus on hygiene.They go beyond simply dispensing water, offering features that cater to the diverse needs of a modern workforce.

**Filtration System:** Modern water dispensers often incorporate advanced filtration systems to ensure the water is free from impurities and contaminants.

A crucial feature is the filtration system, which typically involves multiple stages. This can include sediment filters, carbon filters, and even reverse osmosis membranes. These filters work together to remove chlorine, lead, bacteria, and other harmful substances, resulting in cleaner, fresher-tasting water. Some models even feature UV sterilization to further eliminate bacteria and viruses, ensuring the highest level of water purity.

**Cooling and Heating Capabilities:** The ability to dispense both hot and cold water on demand is a major advantage.

Many water dispensers offer both cooling and heating functions,providing employees with access to both chilled and hot water instantly. Advanced cooling systems use compressor-based technology or thermoelectric cooling to achieve consistent cold temperatures. Similarly, heating systems employ powerful heating elements to quickly heat water for tea, coffee, or instant soups.Precise temperature controls allow users to select their desired water temperature for optimal convenience.

**Hands-Free Operation:** As hygiene becomes increasingly crucial, hands-free dispensing options are becoming more common.

Hands-free operation is an increasingly sought-after feature,especially in shared office environments.These dispensers utilize infrared sensors or foot pedals to activate water dispensing, minimizing the risk of cross-contamination.This hands-free functionality promotes a cleaner and more hygienic environment, ensuring the health and safety of all users. This also minimizes potential damage caused by hand contact with the dispenser over time.

**Smart Features and Connectivity:** Some dispensers come equipped with smart features for monitoring water consumption and maintenance needs.

Some advanced water dispensers incorporate smart technology, including Wi-Fi connectivity and mobile app integration. These features allow users to monitor water consumption, track filter life, and receive maintenance alerts. Some models even offer remote control capabilities, enabling administrators to adjust settings and dispensing volumes from their smartphones or tablets. These smart features provide valuable insights into water usage patterns and ensure optimal dispenser performance.

**Spill-Proof Design and Water Leak Detection:** To prevent messes and potential water damage, advanced dispensers are engineered with spill-proof features.

Manufacturers are increasingly incorporating spill-proof designs to minimize messes and leaks. Features like drip trays with overflow sensors, recessed nozzles, and automatic shut-off mechanisms prevent accidental spills and water damage. Some models even feature water leak detection systems that automatically shut off the water supply in the event of a leak, protecting the office from potential flooding and damage.

**Self-Cleaning Functionality:** To maintain optimal hygiene, dispensers now include automated self-cleaning cycles.

Self-cleaning functionality is becoming a standard feature for high-end water dispensers. these systems automatically sanitize the water tank and pathways, eliminating bacteria, algae, and other microorganisms that can accumulate over time. Self-cleaning cycles typically involve UV sterilization, ozone injection, or thermal disinfection. This automated cleaning process ensures that the water dispenser remains hygienic and provides clean, fresh-tasting water consistently.

## core Benefits

investing in a high-quality water dispenser provides numerous benefits for both employees and the organization.

**Improved Employee Health and Well-being:** Easy access to clean, refreshing water encourages employees to stay hydrated, leading to improved health and well-being. Dehydration can lead to fatigue, headaches, and decreased cognitive function. By providing employees with readily available water,companies can boost productivity,reduce sick days,and create a healthier work environment.

**Increased Productivity and Focus:** staying hydrated helps employees maintain focus and energy levels throughout the day, leading to increased productivity. When employees have convenient access to water, they’re less likely to experience mid-afternoon slumps or distractions caused by thirst. This can result in a significant improvement in overall productivity and workplace efficiency.

**Reduced Waste and Environmental Impact:** Using a water dispenser substantially reduces the reliance on single-use plastic water bottles, contributing to a more lasting office environment. Single-use plastic water bottles contribute to environmental pollution and landfill waste. By switching to a water dispenser, companies can significantly reduce their plastic consumption and environmental footprint. This demonstrates a commitment to sustainability and corporate social obligation,which can resonate with both employees and customers.

**Enhanced Convenience and Accessibility:** A water dispenser provides readily available hot and cold water, eliminating the need for employees to use shared kitchen facilities or bring their own water bottles. This convenience saves time and effort for employees,allowing them to focus on their work. It also promotes a more positive and supportive work environment by providing amenities that enhance comfort and well-being.

**Cost Savings:** While the initial investment may seem high, using a water dispenser can lead to long-term cost savings by eliminating the need to purchase individual water bottles. The cost of constantly purchasing and stocking bottled water can quickly add up, especially in larger offices. A water dispenser represents a more cost-effective solution in the long run, as it only requires occasional filter replacements and maintenance.

## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about water dispensers for offices.

**What type of water dispenser is best for an office setting?**
The best type of water dispenser for an office depends on several factors, including the number of employees, available space, and desired features. Options include bottleless dispensers (also known as point-of-use dispensers) that connect directly to the water line, and bottled water dispensers that use large water jugs. Bottleless dispensers are generally preferred for larger offices as they are more convenient and environmentally friendly.

**How frequently enough should the water dispenser be cleaned and maintained?**
Regular cleaning and maintenance are essential for ensuring the water dispenser remains hygienic and functions properly. The exterior of the dispenser should be wiped down daily, and the drip tray should be emptied and cleaned regularly. The water tank and internal components should be cleaned and sanitized every 3-6 months, depending on usage.Filters should be replaced according to the manufacturer's instructions to maintain water quality.

**Are water dispensers energy efficient?**
many modern water dispensers are designed with energy efficiency in mind.They often feature insulated tanks, energy-saving modes, and automatic shut-off functions to minimize energy consumption. Look for dispensers with energy Star certification, which indicates that they meet specific energy efficiency standards. Choosing an energy-efficient model can help reduce utility costs and minimize the environmental impact.

**What is the average lifespan of a water dispenser?**
The lifespan of a water dispenser can vary depending on the quality of the product,usage patterns,and maintenance practices. High-quality dispensers can last for 5-7 years or even longer with proper care and maintenance. Regular cleaning, filter replacements, and prompt repairs can help extend the lifespan of the dispenser and ensure its reliable performance.

Here’s the math you can copy-paste into any spreadsheet.

---
#### Example
Deposit: $1 000

| Schedule | Formula | 12 % APY | 10 % APY |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Annual (1×) | P (1 + r) | $1 120 | $1 100 |
| Monthly (12×) | P (1 + r⁄12)¹² | $1 127 | $1 105 |
| Weekly (52×) | P (1 + r⁄52)⁵² | $1 129 | **$1 105 → $1 105** |
| Daily (365×) | P (1 + r⁄365)³⁶⁵ | $1 129 | $1 106 |

*Even with **2 % lower APY**, the weekly plan almost ties the annual 12 %.*

---

### Quick mental rule of thumb  
`Extra yield ≈ APY / (2 × n)`  
* n = number of payouts per year.  
* For 10 % APY: moving from annual → monthly gives ≈ 0.4 %; monthly → weekly ~ 0.1 %. Close enough for coffee-shop estimates.

---

### Why it matters
* **CeFi fine print** — many quotes default to monthly or even quarterly; ask support before you deposit.  
* **DeFi farms** — block-by-block rewards beat higher APR pools if gas is cheap.  
* **Trad-Fi CDs & bonds** — US banks must compound daily, so a 4 % CD can edge a “5 % simple interest” offer.

I (22 F) had an agreement with my boyfriend that since he has personal issues with his body image and body in general, he wished to wait for marriage till sex and would spend this time working on loving himself. That's fine, I didn't mind this at all. But I am hypersexual due to past traumas and whenever my depression wants to take me out, I become self destructive using my body.

I don't know if he was aware of this, but I did tell him today. Now set him aside a second, before him I was with a toxic asshole (let's call him David) and my new bf (Let's call him John) hated david because he is abusive, a stalker and shitty. He is still obsessed with me in a joe goldberg way but not enough to kill anyone (i think?) 

I am dumb and I am attached because david was ironically there during a few of my worst times ever and by worst I mean my top three breakdowns in my entire life so far. It's hard to block him and move on, and I asked to be friends with benefits because sex is distracting from life. At this point I wasn't dating John yet, but a few weeks later from this decision we started dating (no labels, labels came two months later) but still we were clearly exclusive and John hated David anyway

I kept being friends with benefits with David and John like I said wished to solve his issues first before doing anything with me but I found it hard to tell him I was still with David. During these months, John told me I am free to be with someone sexually if I wished to. Flashforward 3 months later, aka today like only a few hours ago, John asks me why I have changed recently and he thinks it's because I still have feelings for David. I do not, like I said, I am just attached because I have no friends and he is always there for me even though he's a shit person. 

That doesn't excuse me though of course, I should have been able to put a stop to the FWB thing and stalking thing ages ago when John and I became a couple because I know he is the man I want to spend my life with.

John is laughing when I tell him this and then I can see anger in his eyes and then he says if anything there's three things that hurt him when I told him I'm still sleeping with David. 

1. His ego because why david, a stranger would've been better
2. That I lied all this time. 
3. Why david the abusive asshole (John is worried)

He has every right to block me now and never forgive me, he asked me to leave the coffee shop we were in and I did.

We ended the convo with him asking for how long, since when etc, and asked me what I would do if I was him and honestly I said I'd block and never forgive because that's a shit move. 

I am in the wrong completely but god do I regret it. The sex wasn't that good, what kept me was my stupid shitty trauma. The comfort of having someone you already know. Me and david are a shit show, just trust me on this.

So people, this is your sign to not fuck things up because of your trauma. I'll either go to therapy or stay single forever because I'm trash for doing this for the one man I ever truly loved from the bottom of my heart. I really have no idea what I am doing with my life, my career, my love life, everything doesn't work out and I am to blame not anything else. I constantly make the worst decisions. 

I'm laughable, really.

## #1: [Forest Fables](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DotDotFire.DDF2024)

Forest Fables is the most genuinely enjoyable ""educational"" game I have ever played. It is clearly a cosy game trying to give players a fun experience, yet sneaks in some education, and I can't stop playing it!

### Review

I'm generally not interested in ""cozy"" games, or ""life sim"" games, and this is both. However, the combination of a simple gameplay loop, beautiful artwork, and an extremely fair and a non-manipulative economy culminates in what can only be described as ""a nice time"". I love it.

The general story is you've been kidnapped and taken to ""Wildleaf Forest"", where you'll spend your days wandering around locations, talking to the inhabitants, completing quests, and earning & spending money. At no point is it particularly challenging, with quests typically involving solving simple riddles, navigating conversation trees, or completing ""spot the object"" games in areas. These are all unique, intuitive, tracked in your quest log, and offer generous rewards.

However, this plain description doesn't do the game justice. The writing is excellent, with each character expressing their unique personality in simple conversations, and each feeling like a ""real"" character. Similarly, the artwork is easily amongst the best I've ever seen, with the slightly abstracted pixel art being by favourite style.

Movement in an area is only possibly by tapping on actionable items, such as NPCs, minigames (more on that next!), or quest objects. This avoids any pointless wandering around, since you'll only move when you've done something useful. The movement and style strongly reminds me of [Habbo Hotel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habbo), a game I played ~18 years ago, so nostalgia is definitely impacting my experience! Unlike Habbo Hotel, Forest Fables is single-player and will be a relatively short experience (likely a few days unless you get into the furniture / clothing), but that's OK!

The minigames are unlocked via keys, and none will be anything new, just solid implementations of basic minigames. Things like ""tap the button at the right time to cook the croissant"", or ""pour the coffee ingredients without overflowing"", or ""pick the carrots but not the turnips"". Simple games, that are short and rewarding enough to not be a chore. There is a day/night cycle, with some minigames only being accessible earlier in the day, but this doesn't affect gameplay too much.

Your motivation day-to-day is, broadly-speaking, earning and spending currencies. Whilst there does seem to be too many, it's important to highlight how absolutely optional almost all of them are, with the primary use being entirely cosmetic furniture, clothing, or houses. Whilst some currency is required for repairing your house, or completing quests, this is a negligible amount compared to the purely aesthetic items. So, how do you earn currencies?

The currencies are:

- **Energy**: Whilst this earned is 1 per 10m, it's not like normal energy! It only controls how many minigames you can play per day for coins & acorns, essentially stopping you from becoming rich instantly.
- **Acorns**: Earned through simple minigames, spent on increasing income from minigames _or_ trading for ""keys"".
- **Coins**: Earned through simple minigames, or savings interest, spent to repair / clean home or aesthetic items.
- **Gems**: The main premium currency. Typically purchased, with some available for free, only used for aesthetic items.
- **Keys**: The main progression system, you can exchange acorns for these, then use them to unlock new areas / minigames / content.
- **Stamps**: Used to send ""gifts"" to your NPC friends, increasing your relationship with them.

Keys and stamps are perhaps more ""items"" than currencies, but they're earned and spent like a currency! Speaking of currency, it's time to cover why this is an educational game...

The game has amazing financial education built-in! With financial literacy typically being scarily low, especially amongst the younger audience who might play games like this, I was absolutely amazed with how detailed and relevant all the information is. The concepts aren't just mentioned, they are explained in detail, with NPCs offering additional answers to questions. From my first couple of days with the game (""Year 2 Month 2"" in-game), I've been exposed to:

1. The **credit rating system**, what it is, why it matters, expressed in-game as ""Money Wise Rating"". The calculation of this is (as in the real world!) somewhat vague, with an NPC giving you a new score every few months based on your financial behaviour(?).
2. Comparing **current accounts**, with one of the first in-game actions being an explanation of what they are, and choosing between an in-game bank and credit union (which are of course also explained).
3. Comparing **savings accounts**, with an entire quest dedicated to helping find an account that meets an NPC's financial needs, including not needing access for a year, comparing interest rates, etc. The process was essentially identical to real life, providing extremely helpful information to those new to saving money.
4. Comparing **renting vs buying**, a concept that many adults struggle with, is also covered by a quest. Different NPCs offer different pros and cons, just like in the real world, with the ultimate decision being down to you. This is also reinforced by your own need to pay in-game rent, and having to choose where to rent, or try to save up and purchase a house.

This information is also, most importantly, not told in a US-centric way. The advice is generic enough (e.g. using AER %) that it applies to almost any country, reinforced by the developer's self-description:

> Dot Dot Fire creates educational games that empower young people with lifechanging money skills and sustainable lifestyle in 100+ countries.

Whilst I personally didn't learn anything from the game, I already have an intense interest in personal finance (I've reviewed [bank accounts](https://jakelee.co.uk/chase-bank-uk-review/), made a [house buying & selling calculator](https://jakelee.co.uk/house-affordability-spreadsheet/), and [shared household expenses strategies](https://jakelee.co.uk/using-income-ratio-spreadsheet-split-bills/), it's one of my main hobbies!). I also have been comparing bank accounts for 15 years, bought and sold homes, ran startups etc, so I am not the target educational audience. However, for someone a bit younger, or with less of a financial obsession? This game could save them weeks of research, or thousands in wasted financial opportunity.

The developer's other games ""[Money Wise Game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DotDotFireLimited.TheNeighborMood)"" and ""[NeighborMood](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.DotDotFire.TheNeighborMoodFP2022)"" seem to also be in the genre ""fun games that secretly teach you essential financial literacy skills"". The screenshots in Money Wise Game in particular highlight avoiding scams, not falling for credit card traps etc, all skills startlingly lacking in the real world.

With Forest Fables succeeding on the gameplay front, the style front, _and_ the educational front, it's one of my strongest recommendations so far. However, will it ruin this with aggressive monetisation? No, it won't!

### Monetisation

Despite having all these currencies, the monetisation is extremely fair! There are no forced adverts, with optional ones available for decent perks like discount vouchers on items.

There are bundles of stamps, gems, keys, ad-free for X days etc, however they are all very cheap. For example, I purchased the largest pack of keys available for just £1.49 ($~1.99), and that ensured I could unlock every minigame & area with a couple leftover. Similarly, ad-free for 30 days is often an absurdly overpriced item, here it is just £2.49 (~$3.49), so that's an appealing offer too.

Ultimately you don't need any of these at all, with the only real incentive to buy the truly premium currency (gems) optional items like clothes and furniture. I think paying for aesthetic items is totally fine, and a very fair system. This seems to be the developer's intention, as _all_ the more expensive packs are primarily clothing packs (which look great!) with a few gems.

### Tips

- Check your savings account options when your Money Wise Rating increases, as new accounts become available.
- Visit every location every day, and talk to everyone. It increases your friendship status with them slightly.
- I find the croissant cooking game to be the best. All minigames earn the same, but the croissant cooking is easiest to get perfect every time, whilst also being very quick. It also can be played at night, unlike the coffee machine.
- It's probably a bad idea buying items full price, watching an advert for a discount voucher will let you save significantly (25-50%), so should be done whenever possible.
- As with the real world, you should try to keep almost all of your money in a savings account, earning interest.
- Again as with the real world, I personally would recommend saving up for any house to avoid paying rent. Luckily my favourite was the relatively cheap log cabin (12,000), so I'm unlikely to buy any other house leaving plenty of spare money.
- You get paid for your work the month _after_ you work, so don't worry if you don't seem to be earning anything!

## #2: [Dig-Dig Rush](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.learn.daily.grow)

This game is not at all what I expected. I wanted to play a slow, pretty game about mining and upgrading loot. Instead, I entered what can only be described as incremental system overload, and yet I can't stop playing.

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 1.0.0.26: **[Main screen](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/may-dig-1.jpg) | [Adventure](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/may-dig-2.jpg) | [Digging](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/may-dig-3.jpg) | [Arena](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/may-dig-4.jpg) | [Collectables](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/may-dig-5.jpg) | [Events](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/may-dig-6.jpg) | [Pets](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/may-dig-7.jpg) | [Inventory](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/may-dig-8.jpg)**

### Review

In Dig-Dig Rush, you are mining rocks across various areas to ""prove yourself"" to a big... lightbulb... king? I don't know, there's a lot to keep track of in this game and the hint of story isn't important. Mine the rock, obtain items to make you stronger, kill enemies, and repeat. Simple! Except, there's so many systems layered on top that is almost feels like a parody of incrementals / gachas, with every ""pass"" / ""arena"" / ""guild"" / ""bonus"" you can imagine existing somewhere.

So, as I mentioned, Dig-Dig Rush has a truly absurd number of systems and sub-systems. Unlike most incrementals where you are deciding how best to use your resources, here you are merely trying to keep up with the flood of items being thrown at you from progression systems, and trying to work out what on earth anything even is. There are so many that there's even a progression system for how many progression systems / game features you've unlocked, with 24 entries(!).

I'm going to do my best to describe the sources of items / currency I am aware of, but note that I'm only a couple of days in, and have undoubtedly missed some despite staring at the game whilst writing this. Note that most of these reward items of some kind:

1. The main game: Mining for items, each with stats & perks, to fit into your 12(!) equipment slots.
2. ""Climb the Ranks: Adventuring up & Tarot Triumph"": 2x boards of challenges for completing ""adventures"", along with end-of-event rewards depending on your rank, and a shop for each. These also earn currencies for the ""Ranking store"".
3. ""Preview"": Diamonds rewarded for unlocking new game features, and showing you what is next.
4. ""Daily Quests"": Nice and simple quests, reward a unique currency for completion plus rewards at various totals.
5. ""Week of Wonders"": Totally different system that functions similarly to ""Daily Quests"", but you can complete tasks from any current or previous days this week. Also rewards a unique currency.
6. ""7-Day Sign-in"": Unrelated to the week of wonders, a thankfully simple daily bonus with streak rewards etc.
7. Advertising collection of systems:
   1. ""Privilege Centre: Perk Pass"": Mostly just adverts for 4 complex pass systems, but also has a daily bonus.
   2. ""Privilege Centre: Growth Plan"": 5x progression systems for various aspects of the game, with rewards at various levels and the ability to pay for better rewards. Also a daily bonus.
   3. ""Beginner's Deals"": Standard bundle adverts, yet has a daily bonus.
8. ""Black Market"": A traditional ""exchange diamonds for items"" shop.
9. ""Spending Bonus"": A progression system for total purchases _and_ purchase streaks.
10. ""Arena"": Player vs player, with loot from each fight and daily & weekly rewards based on your overall ranking.
11. ""Idle Rewards"": A typical idle system, earning pickaxe uses & coins & time skips over time.
12. ""Ascension"": Completing large objectives to ascend to a new rank, increasing your stats and level cap.
13. ""Lode level"": Spending gold to upgrade your chance of achieving rarer loot.
14. Character collection of systems:
    1. Can forge different headpieces with different stats.
    2. Can upgrade your headpiece to boost stats.
    3. Can collect sets of headpieces to unlock bonuses.
15. Divination collection of systems:
    1. Can ""divine"" fragments of cards, that then form full cards, providing boosts.
    2. Can collect sets of cards to unlock bonuses.
16. Pet collection of systems:
    1. Can summon pets with different rarities and bonuses.
    2. Can upgrade / merge pets to improve their stats.
    3. Can collect sets of pets to unlock bonuses.
17. Guild collection of systems (there's also a store):
    1. Guild trials, fighting a boss on cooldown for rewards, can also claim ""chests"" when others kill.
    2. Donating diamonds to the guild in exchange for 3 other currencies.
    3. ""Help""ing guildmates provided coin boosts for both.
18. Base collection of systems:
    1. Mining for stones and other resources in your basement.
    2. Using stones to purchase various boosts on a tech tree.
    3. Opening chests with item fragments inside, providing boosts.
    4. Earning points from these chests that open other chests.
    5. Collecting sets of collectibles that, you guessed it, provide boosts.
19. Adventure collection of systems:
    1. Fighting steadily harder battles to progress, earning loot after each.
    2. Receiving rewards for each ""chapter"" cleared.
20. Dungeon collection of systems:
    1. ""Daily dungeons"": 4x unique boss fights, each of which use their own key to unlock and provide unique rewards.
    2. ""Endless trials"": Progressively harder battles, offering chests and other rewards.
    3. ""Challenge the intruders"": Again, progressively harder battles with rewards.
21. The 5 systems I haven't unlocked yet (Farm, Space Odyssey, Backgear, Radio, Artifacts), each of which sound large.

Are you getting the idea now? It's ridiculous, and you'll be spending all your time just trying to wander around the menus and find out where to claim whatever free item you have there. It seems like the game's strategy is to include every engagement & monetisation technique possible, so at least one of them catches you. Like rolling for pets, and upgrading them? Or talking to your guild? Or daily passes? It'll be in here somewhere!

There also seems to be multiple servers you can play on at once, with a new character in each. Just yet another feature.

Eventually your pickaxe uses start to run out, but I hit ~1m power before then, and I'm pretty sure when I wake up tomorrow I'll have a thousand free _things_ to sort out. The game's art is beautiful, and there are hundreds of unique assets, yet it's hard to actually notice them in amongst all the _stuff_ on screen at any time. It's not unusual to have 3-4 dialogs stacked on top of each other, each requiring an action, as you try to navigate a menu whilst auto-mining in the background.

Bizarrely, despite the game having more features than almost any I've played, it only has ~50k downloads, and [their Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hUggAeBhEc) only has ~400 members! The game feels like it's a massively popular AAA game from an alternate universe that has just been transferred in, and has lost the millions of users that are surely needed to build something so complex. I did notice some non-English very briefly appearing at one point, and the developers are in Singapore, so I wonder if this is a giant game in China / elsewhere now entering the western market.

It's hard to review this game beyond saying that if you enjoy drowning in menus whilst watching numbers go up, you'll enjoy it. I do, I think. It's hard to tell.

### Monetisation

Think of a technique, it has it, at every price point from $1 to $300. Truly absurd:

- Ads to skip waits, ads to retry fights, ads to increase rewards, ads to roll for rewards.
- Bundles of different currencies, bundles for starters, bundle for specific use cases, bundles of items.
- New starter bonus, limited time bonus, first purchase bonus, purchase streak bonus, increase rewards from various passes bonuses.
- Pay to spin the wheel, pay to upgrade rewards, pay to skip waits, pay to get daily rewards, pay to remove ads, pay to beat other guilds.

Despite this madness, there's so much going on that it all kind of cancels out. I usually buy 1-2 things in a game, but there are so many options here that none of them stand out. The closest thing is the ""Monthly pass"" providing daily _stuff_ for ~$6, yet so much is provided for free anyway that it feels pointless.

Truly impressive how the game has been overmonetized to the extent that I'm unlikely to spend anything or watch any adverts!

### Tips

- Complete quests as soon as they appear, to unlock the next one.
- Focus on the ascension goals, they're what actually matters long term.
- Save your pet summon points for one good pet instead of upgrading your starter.
- The global chat can be absolutely awful, but keep an eye out for a good guild to join.
- Good luck finding all your various things that are recharging on a timer, I constantly find new bits and pieces!
- As you level up(?) you can auto-pickaxe more at once, there's no downside to always setting this to your maximum.
- There [is a Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hUggAeBhEc).

## #3: [Paper War](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.firestudios.paperwar)

Paper War is a straightforward autobattler, where you'll be building up a little army to fight enemy armies and complete quests, earning coins and gems to upgrade your army. And repeat.

### Screenshots

All screenshots are from version 24: **[Combat](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/may-paper-1.jpg) | [Skills](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/may-paper-2.jpg) | [Army](https://jakelee.co.uk/assets/images/2025/may-paper-3.jpg)**

### Review

Before diving deeper into the review, this game is a bit odd. It has a solid early game, and looks like it continues to grow, but in reality you've seen pretty much all of the game's content after 10-20 minutes!

The developer seems to have 2 other quite similar games (same concept, style, UI), [Circle Defense](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.firestudios.circledefense) and [The Army](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.firestudios.thearmy), suggesting to me at least that perhaps each game isn't a labour of love, but instead trying to figure out what will get users / profit.

So, with that massive caveat out of the way, what is Paper War? Well, you'll recruit permanent ""Characters"" to your army, and summon permanent ""Skills"", which will then automatically attack waves of enemies for you, with no ability to take manual control. There's essentially no strategy around placement, and all skills autocast perfectly, with the only real choice being which skills to select and what to spend earnings on.

The game isn't balanced, with my single rare ""Onager"" being 10x as strong as any other character in every aspect. As characters do not respawn between waves, this means only my rare character survives any battles for more than a second, so is typically all I'll see! Whilst there is a ""Gold Rush"" and ""Boss Rush"" mode (requiring slowly respawning keys), the enemies will die so quickly they'll barely be visible, making it really just a ""free loot"" mode.

There is a quest system helping to guide your initial gameplay, but it quickly hits an impassable wall. Upgrade costs increases as you upgrade, so getting from 100 -> 150 in a skill is about as tricky as, say, 150 -> 170. As such, quest 84 that requires getting from 200 to 700 hitpoints is essentially impossible unless you leave the game alone for hours, and your progress is severely limited until it is completed (quests are the main gem source). You can also prestige, but it provides negligible benefits (20% more gold) in exchange for an almost complete reset!

Finally, there's a PvP event (which required signing up for an account) that is very bare bones. Use a ticket, get matched randomly against an opponent (AI, using a player's army), one of you completely destroys the other. No tactics, no planning, just matching against someone with literally 1000x stronger units than you. A bit pointless.

So is it good? Well, no not really. Every minute playing it is vaguely enjoyable, and it looks pretty, but you'll notice essentially no difference 10 minutes vs 100 minutes into the game, with other player's reviews suggesting this isn't going to change any time soon. Perhaps one to pick up for an hour, then delete.

### Monetisation

This is probably the most fleshed-out area of the game! There are 4x ""cards"" providing various daily bonuses, 3x ""packages"" providing resources, 6x gem packs, and various incentivised ad offers scattered all over the place.

None if it is forced, but I do suspect the slowing down of gameplay is to encourage paying.

### Tips

- A single strong unit will overwhelm everything else, so you might as well use all your summoned army units to upgrade your strong unit / maximises chances of getting one.
- Try out the skills, I found ""Poison Cloud"" (area of effect attack) to work well.
- There [is an oddly large Discord](https://discord.com/invite/MqWhZP8Kn4).

I am trying to get a job in Draper (near 12300 S & 90 E). I'm trying to get there from the FrontRunner station. I'm new to public transportation and I need some help. 

I see that bus route 126 goes along 12300 S. I'm looking at the schedules for 126 on the UTA website and I have some questions. 

a) there are two ""Draper station"" stops several minutes apart. Are these both stops at the FrontRunner station? I assume that's the ""station"" it means? But why are there two of them? If I get to the FrontRunner station while the bus is between stations 1 and 2, have I missed the bus? Or does Draper Station 2 mean it comes back to the station? 

b) the next stop after ""Draper station"" 1 and 2 is 12300 S & 300 E. However, on Google Maps there's a stop outside of Kung Fu Coffee. I would naturally like to get off at this stop instead of 12300 S & 300 E because it's closer to my destination. Does the bus actually stop there? It's not on the schedule.

I learned to be comfortable with narcissism and how to navigate it so well that, when I started dating, that's who I was drawn to. I've dated quite a few of them. I started dating this fellow who was still married (separated but still living in the house with his now ex-wife and their kids). It was a very odd situation, to say the least. Had his cake and was eating it too. His therapist told him he was full of shit and that he needed to get himself together. 

We dated for about 3 months and then had a bit of a messy breakup. I went about my life... or tried to but this guy would not move on even though he was the one to terminate things. 

two-ish months go by that were riddled with harassment of whomever I was spending time with. 

Month 4, we run into one another and he asks to go to coffee or grab a glass of wine. I was curious as to what he had to say. He never once apologized but he worked his charm on me and another month of hanging out, we ended up back together as we both had some time to work on our personal stuff. He had to deal with coming out; I had to deal with other stuff (that is a whole other story about an abusive ex). 

We dated for a couple of years and were married almost 10 years ago. 

The coping/masking/avoidance ""skills"" I learned from dealing with my parents come into play on a regular basis. I wouldn't say our marriage is always easy but, at least I am in a position to help him manage his personal relationships whilst being a bit of a narcissist. I'm definitely not a martyr type. I stand my ground when he has a meltdown and I send him a text to explain my observations of his behavior. There have only been a couple of events that were definitely on me but, more often than not, it's on him. He rarely apologizes aloud but he gets a little meek when we see one another after an ""episode"" of churlish behavior.

Anyone else a Narcissist Navigator?

Over the past months, my team and I have been building an app to solve a problem we know *way too well* — studying at university is chaotic.

There are overlapping exams, deadlines popping up everywhere, and that constant feeling that you’re wasting your time.

And just when you *really* need someone to study with or ask questions… you’re alone.

That’s why we built **StudyBuddy**: a free app that helps you stay focused (with a timer better than Pomodoro), track your exam goals, and match with students from your university who are studying the same subjects as you.

We just released the mobile version and thought we'd share it here.

Not to sell it (it’s free anyway), but because we made this for students like us - the ones who’ve looked at a massive study plan and thought “How the hell am I supposed to get through this?”

If you want to give it a try or roast us with honest feedback, we’d genuinely appreciate it 🙏

iOS: [app store link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/studybuddy-universit%C3%A0/id6670455793)

Android: [play store link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.studybuddyit.studybuddy&hl=it)

Also, if you're curious about what launching an app as broke ex-university students looks like (no funding, lots of sleepless nights, trying not to lose our minds), happy to share more in the comments 😅

**Esim** Couldn't decide on an esim or figure it out at Narita. Glad I didn't get it there. DL'd Airalo at my hotel..very easy and much cheaper. Used 5gb+1 GB (welcome free promo) for about $11 US. Phoned Telus at YVR and they made some change to use an Esim. Telus also informed me to physically remove their SIM to prevent possible roaming charges. I have a Pixel 8.

**Tokyo**: Stayed in Ueno across from the park and loved it. The street food stalls and market shopping were great. Plus quick access by foot to yamashiroya toy store and Akihabara. 
Also did Asakusa, Shibuya and Shinjuku among others.

**Shinkansen**: SmartEx wouldnt allow me to book with my CDN CC. We went in to the train stations and had it done by staff which was totally worth it.If you missed grabbing something prior to boarding the train, there's a small convienance store right on the platform. 
Shinkansen has free wifi (slow) and power outlets for charging.

**Kyoto**: Worried I may not like it due to the polarized reviews here and reported crowds, Crowds were there ofc but what made Kyoto great was everything but the main tourist areas. We did those too and they were fine, some skippable. 

What makes Kyoto great, IMO, is the walks around river and tree lines paths while stumbling upon a great restaurant or coffee find. If you're a couple or group of friends, renting a bike looked like a great way to explore the city on a warm night.We wished we could have rented bikes but just wasn't possible with my kids.Locals were kind to us even with kids. Never cued for a meal. Never followed social media recommendations.

**Takayama**-Felt like a very condensed version of Kyoto with similar scenery and shops. Very noticable older euro crowd there, compared to other places we visited, even Kyoto.We wished we spent one less day there.

**Shirakawago** - Very picturesque village despite the hordes of tour groups. Continue to wonder if the only ppl who actually live there are the ones that just run the shops since any open building is either a souvenir shop, cafe or restaurant.Spend 6 hrs there and it was enough for us.

**Language**: Learn what you can buy don't stress. Thank you, sorry or excuse me go a long way there. Restuarant ordering is a great learning opportunity. Did my best with my butchered Japanese, surprised how often people just asked in English what I needed.Google lens and translate were great for reading menus, signs etc, or if I needed to buy a specific item like a SIM removal tool.

**Masking**- Mask if you want but I observed probably 1/3 to 1/2 of Japanese ppl on trains wearing masks. 

**Luggage** - Yes, luggage forwarding changes the game . Usually 2000-2500 for a big suitcase. Worth it not having lug around a heavy bag while scrambling for a quick transfer train.

**Constipation**, Yeah got it despite drinking a lot of water and spending most of the day walking. Colace in the drug store (thnx Redditors) helped then buying high fibre cereal in the supermarket, did the trick.

**Surprises/ Takeaways**

-We liked Tokyo as much as we did. Even with half our crew of introverts.Constant food choices and stuff to see.

-Don Quitoe has variety, sure, but is not the cheapest place to buy things. Found many things much cheaper at those corner drug stores, Matsumoto Kiyoshi or Daiso etc 

-Didn't bring back as much as we thought we would. We had a large suitcase with another suitcase inside of it in case we needed the room for stuff home. Turns out we didn't . Vancouver has a large Asian population with similar Asian shopping stores we saw in Japan.We bought things that was just cheaper in cost really, a few unique items and souvenirs.

-We never got sick despite shoulder to shoulder contact in packed markets like Asakusa.

-Sometimes getting an early breakfast (before 9am) can be a hard find. We really had to search that out at times even in parts of Tokyo.

-Kyoto wasn't bad at all and looking back I see the appeal. It's a great hub to park and day trip other places. It has a range of food from average priced Ramen to very high end meals.

Overall, loved Japan and a great first experience. Kids loved it and didn't want to leave.Would return again and checkout different areas",7,1746721239.0,JapanTravelTips,3,0.82,False

1khu7ie,https://i.redd.it/kelsjgeyxkze1.jpeg,"45 [F4M] Texas/anywhere, love doesn't have to be as elusive as Bigfoot","Even when I was little, I knew I never wanted children. While my kindergarten classmates played house, I made fake crayon newspapers to hide in the play kitchen cupboards and dreamed of being a librarian someday. While at my age I should certainly expand my dating search to those that have grown children, something in me maintains the mindset that my future compatriot is one who has also intentionally chosen this path and not just accidentally fallen into childlessness or aged out of active parenthood.

But what's with the get-up, you ask? I'll tell you the whole story behind my racing cosplay once we get to know each other. But for now, I'm tired of being swiped right on dating apps just because of my pretty face, not for the depth or substance of my words. So, you get this for now. 

While I have been self-assuredly single for several years, the idea of a true partnership with a man I enjoy the company of would be a different kind of delightful. My friends say that it won't happen until I 'give up', but what's the point in giving up?

Your height doesn't matter, your heart does. Like me, you are relentlessly dedicated to both self-improvement and improving the lives of others. Hopefully you're sober, but at the very least you don't include breweries as one of your hobbies or put the 'fun' in functional. Adventurous, spontaneous, grounded; an equal balance silly and serious. (That's both of us, babe.) 

Honestly, I'd prefer you be outside of Texas or willing to gang up and leave this state with me. Between climate change and local politics, things have been heating up and I have no real ties here. Plus, I'm no damsel in this dress, but a little manly security at home for a gal in this day and age would be appreciated.

Cooking for you is my love language, co-piloting our upcoming road trips is my specialty, coming up with the next goofy race costume by myself gets lonely. If this post resonated with you, brew yourself a cup of coffee and come chat with me; let's see if the success story is us.

1khu6yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Kind-Claim-2577/comments/1khu6yv/chocolate_myths_busted_whats_true_and_whats_not/,Chocolate Myths Busted: What's True and What's Not?,"Chocolate: the sweet, comforting treat that has captured hearts and palates around the world. It’s been praised as a superfood, blamed for acne, and romanticized as an aphrodisiac. But how much of what we hear about chocolate is actually true? The world of chocolate is full of myths and misconceptions. In this blog, we’re busting the most common chocolate myths and revealing the facts, backed by science.

 

**Myth #1: Chocolate Causes Acne**

**The Truth:** Chocolate does not directly cause acne.

For decades, dermatologists and parents warned teenagers to avoid chocolate to keep their skin clear. However, recent scientific studies have shown that **there is no direct link between chocolate consumption and acne**. According to a review published in the *Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology*, acne is more closely associated with **high-glycemic foods** and **dairy products** rather than chocolate itself.

**Important Fact:** A 2016 study involving over 2,000 adolescents found no significant difference in acne prevalence between those who ate chocolate and those who didn’t.

 

**Myth #2: Chocolate Is Addictive Like Drugs**

**The Truth:** While chocolate contains mood-enhancing compounds, it is not chemically addictive in the same way as drugs.

[Chocolate](https://www.truegether.com/category/home-and-garden) contains substances like **phenylethylamine** and **anandamide**, which trigger the brain's pleasure centers. However, the quantities are too small to cause real dependency. The craving for chocolate is more **psychological and emotional** than physical.

**Important Figure:** Theobromine, a stimulant in chocolate, is 10 times weaker than caffeine and is unlikely to create dependency.

 

**Myth #3: Dark Chocolate Is Always Healthy**

**The Truth:** Dark chocolate has health benefits, but not all dark chocolate qualifies as ""healthy.""

Dark chocolate is rich in **flavonoids**, which are powerful antioxidants. These can help lower blood pressure, improve blood flow, and reduce the risk of heart disease. However, many dark chocolate products are still **loaded with sugar and fats**, which can negate these benefits.

**Important Tip:** Look for dark chocolate with **at least 70% cocoa content** and minimal added sugar.

**Fact:** A study in the *British Medical Journal* found that regular consumption of high-flavanol chocolate reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by **up to 37%**.

 

**Myth #4: Chocolate Has No Nutritional Value**

**The Truth:** Chocolate, particularly dark chocolate, contains several beneficial nutrients.

Cocoa is a source of **iron, magnesium, copper, and manganese**. It also contains fiber and powerful antioxidants. Milk chocolate, while less potent in these nutrients, still contributes to calcium intake due to its dairy content.

**Important Numbers:**

* A 100g bar of dark chocolate (70-85% cocoa) contains:
   * 67% of the RDI for iron
   * 58% of the RDI for magnesium
   * 89% of the RDI for copper
   * 98% of the RDI for manganese

 

**Myth #5: Chocolate Makes You Gain Weight**

**The Truth:** Overeating any calorie-dense food can lead to weight gain, but moderate chocolate consumption does not inherently make you fat.

Like all treats, chocolate should be enjoyed in moderation. Some studies have shown that **dark chocolate can help control appetite** and reduce cravings for sweet, salty, and fatty foods.

**Important Statistic:** A study published in *Nutrition* found that people who regularly consumed moderate amounts of chocolate had a **lower body mass index (BMI)** than those who didn’t.

 

**Myth #6: Chocolate Has Too Much Caffeine**

**The Truth:** Chocolate contains caffeine, but not in levels high enough to cause concern for most people.

The caffeine content in chocolate varies by type. **Milk chocolate typically contains 3-6 mg of caffeine per ounce**, while **dark chocolate may have 12-25 mg per ounce**. For comparison, an 8 oz cup of coffee contains about **95 mg of caffeine**.

**Important Note:** You would need to eat **over 3.5 ounces (100g) of dark chocolate** to get the same caffeine as in one cup of coffee.

 

**Myth #7: White Chocolate Is Real Chocolate**

**The Truth:** Technically, white chocolate is not considered real chocolate because it does not contain cocoa solids.

White chocolate is made from **cocoa butter, sugar, and milk solids**, but it lacks the cocoa powder that gives traditional chocolate its flavor and health benefits. That said, high-quality white chocolate made with real cocoa butter can still be a delicious treat.

**Important Distinction:** The **FDA mandates** that for a product to be labeled as white chocolate, it must contain **at least 20% cocoa butter**.

 

**Myth #8: Chocolate Is Bad for Your Heart**

**The Truth:** In moderation, chocolate can be good for your heart health.

The flavonoids in dark chocolate help **relax blood vessels, reduce inflammation**, and **improve cholesterol levels**. Studies have linked moderate chocolate consumption with a **reduced risk of stroke and coronary heart disease**.

**Important Data:**

* A Harvard study involving over **31,000 women** found that those who ate chocolate one to three times a week had a **lower risk of heart failure**.

 

**Myth #9: Chocolate Has No Place in a Diabetic Diet**

**The Truth:** Diabetics can enjoy chocolate in moderation.

Low-sugar or sugar-free dark chocolate can be a **safe occasional treat for diabetics**. It has a lower glycemic index compared to milk chocolate and doesn’t spike blood sugar levels as quickly.

**Important Advice:** Choose chocolate with **high cocoa content and no added sugars**. Always consult a healthcare professional before making dietary changes.

 

**Myth #10: Chocolate Is a Modern Creation**

**The Truth:** Chocolate has been consumed for thousands of years.

The ancient **Olmecs, Mayans, and Aztecs** were the first to cultivate cacao. They consumed it as a **bitter, spiced beverage** rather than the sweet treat we know today. Chocolate only became sweetened and solidified after its introduction to Europe in the 16th century.

**Fun Fact:** The Mayans believed cacao was a gift from the gods and used it in religious rituals and even as currency.

 

**Final Thoughts**

Chocolate, one of the world’s most beloved indulgences, is surrounded by myths that often cloud its true nature. While it shouldn’t be seen as a health food miracle, it also doesn’t deserve the bad reputation it sometimes gets. When consumed in moderation and in its purest forms, chocolate can offer **genuine health benefits**, historical intrigue, and emotional satisfaction. Further, you can also buy chocolates from online stores such as TrueGether, which is one of the best [eBay alternatives](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html).

So the next time someone warns you that your chocolate habit is rotting your skin or heart, you’ll know better. Enjoy it mindfully and savor every myth-free bite.

I had also (kinda) skipped my normal morning breakfast (I try to do a pancake because they make me happy, and then tiny sausage patties ) instead I just did 3 of the sausage patties and a slice of sourdough toast because I “was running behind” I told myself. Welp it backfired when I ate dinner. It was a nice filling dinner but oh my god the stomach cramps and pain after eating from the lack of food during the day, it was terrible. I got crazy tired too and had to go to sleep earlier than I wanted. I was just thinking about how I definitely made up those excuses to try not to eat tbh. I could’ve waiting in the line or even went and got food from the deli, but then I was worried about not having my safe food from the coffe shop for lunch, and I definitely had time to whip up a pancake in the morning I was just kinda stalling taking time doing my makeup. I haven’t had this problem yet with my recovery since I’ve been trying to hold myself accountable when it comes to getting healthier. I felt so much guilt after skipping lunch like I did, kinda like when I used to restrict and would eat food. Will the guilt with eating ever end? Even after recovery? I feel like I’ll always have some type of guilt one way or another. And will my brain always make up safe foods and food rules also during/after recovery? I didn’t realize I was still categorizing my foods as safe and unsafe since I’ve been letting myself eat anything. Now I’m seeing I’m gravitating towards certain things that are “safe” because subconsciously I know they’re either lower cal or something I know for a fact I will like, in fear of wasting my meal time on something that “may not be worth it” which ties back to my restricting where I refused to eat anything in fear of wasting cals. I just feel so defeated, I’ll do better today, but I’m worried about this happening again and me ignoring it like I did yesterday ",3,1746721106.0,AnorexiaNervosa,1,0.72,False
