So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job and I travel a lot. I suppose it’s a good life, I don’t brag but I’ve been told that. It drives me insane because I’m always busy. I guess busy is good.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

1kea55t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1kea55t/from_highly_ambitious_to_quiet_joys/,From highly ambitious to quiet joys,"I don’t know what happened to me. I used to be very ambitious and someone who wants to achieve extraordinary things in life, 6 years ago. But now, I just feel satisfied with the little things in life— drinking my first and only cup of coffee in the morning, being able to solve little problems and puzzles at work, sometimes having a good conversation with random ppl and listening to music throughout the day. It makes me even more happy when I was able to physically exercise during the day, eat the right nutrition and sleep for atleast 7 hours.


I am just 25 y/o but I don’t feel like wanting anything more in life. I’m satisfied that I’m able to pay my own bills and set a side little every month. I’d be really extra happy if I learn something new or improve myself in different aspects of my life every day. I don’t focus too much about the future. If I die today, I’m fine with that. But I still strive to live long that’s why I eat healthy foods and take care of my body. My goal right now is to just focus on building good habits and embracing the ups, downs and boredom that life naturally has. 


Nonetheless, for some unknown reason, I sometimes feel left out especially when I’m around ppl my age. I know eveyone’s different but I can’t help but question if I will ever regret living like this when I’m older. There’s like an invisible force in the back of my head pushing me to grind, but I don’t want to because I don’t enjoy that kind of thing. I just strive to be more present and try my best to enjoy each and every day. Am I weird? lol",1,1746328091.0,CasualPH,0,1.0,False

* Apparently there's a small lockable cupboard that needs you to provide your own lock, how big is this cupboard? (pictures would be great!!)
* In the restricted items section it mentions that you can't bring large stereos or DJ equipment (a shame cause i got a flx4 a couple months ago and was planning to practice with it thru university), but what really counts as a ""large stereo""?

1kea3yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_fwdtrek/comments/1kea3yt/decoding_the_clutch_whats_actually_going_on_in/,**Decoding the Clutch: What's Actually Going On In There?**,"Okay, buckle up, buttercups, because we're diving headfirst into the heart of your motorcycle – the clutch! Think of it as the ultimate gatekeeper, deciding when your engine's power gets to play with the wheels. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. It's a whole universe of friction plates, springs, and levers just begging to be understood. So, grab a coffee (or something stronger, no judgement here) and let's unravel this mechanical marvel!

**Pro-Tip Power-Ups:**

*   **Feather Like a Boss:** Learn to *feather* that clutch, people! It's the difference between smooth starts and looking like you're trying to wrestle a wild badger off the bike. Gentle is the key.
*   **Listen to Your Bike:** That clutch lever isn't just for show. Feel it, listen to the engine note. A little practice and you'll be able to diagnose problems before they leave you stranded.
*   **Fresh Oil, Happy Clutch:** Use the right oil, and change it regularly. Clutch performance is massively affected by the oil quality. Don't be a cheapskate on this one, trust me.

Alright, picture this: a stack of plates, like a metallic pancake breakfast. These are your clutch plates, and they come in two delicious flavors:

*   **Friction Plates:** These guys are covered in a special material (friction material, duh!) designed to create grip. They are splined to the clutch basket
*   **Steel Plates:** These are smooth steel or aluminum discs that sit between the friction plates. They are splined to the central hub.

Normally, these plates are pressed tightly together by a bunch of springs. This locks the engine's power to the transmission. Now, when you pull that clutch lever, you're essentially telling the springs to take a chill pill. This separates the plates, breaks the power connection and lets you shift gears, stop, or do wheelies (responsibly, of course).

## **Types of Motorcycle Clutches: Wet vs. Dry (and Why You Should Care)**

Now, here's where things get a little saucy. Clutches come in two main varieties:

*   **Wet Clutches:** This is the most common type, found in the majority of bikes. ""Wet"" because the clutch plates are bathed in engine oil. This keeps things cool, lubricated, and quiet. Bonus? They tend to last longer.
*   **Dry Clutches:** These are the rebels of the clutch world, found in some performance bikes (think Ducatis!). They operate outside the engine oil, which means they can be lighter and offer a slightly more direct feel. The trade-off? They're noisier, can wear out faster, and can be a bit…temperamental.
   *   *Quick note on slipper clutches* - Slipper clutches help mitigate the issue of 'engine braking', where the engine wants to slow the rear wheel more rapidly than is ideal. These are popular on performance bikes and can make downshifting much smoother.

## **Troubleshooting Common Clutch Conundrums**

So, your clutch is acting up? Don't panic! Here are a few common issues and what they might mean:

*   **Clutch Slipping:** This is when your engine revs up, but your bike doesn't accelerate as quickly as it should. It feels like you're losing power. Causes can include worn-out clutch plates, oil contamination, or a poorly adjusted clutch cable.
*   **Clutch Drag:** This is when the clutch doesn't fully disengage when you pull the lever. It makes shifting difficult and can cause the bike to creep forward even with the clutch pulled in. The cause is often a cable issue.
*   **Hard to Find Neutral:** Another symptom of clutch drag or a bad cable adjustment.

## **DIY Clutch Maintenance: Getting Your Hands Dirty**

While some clutch repairs are best left to the pros, there are a few things you can tackle yourself:

*   **Adjusting the Clutch Cable:** This is clutch maintenance 101. A properly adjusted clutch cable ensures that the clutch engages and disengages smoothly. Consult your owner's manual for the correct procedure, but it usually involves adjusting the free play at the lever.
*   **Changing the Clutch Fluid (If Applicable):** Some bikes use a hydraulic clutch system, which requires regular fluid changes. Think of it like brake fluid.
*   **Checking the Clutch Plates (For the Brave):** If you're feeling adventurous, you can inspect your clutch plates for wear. This involves removing the clutch cover and disassembling the clutch assembly. But be warned: it can be messy and requires a decent amount of mechanical skill. If you're not confident, leave it to a professional.",1,1746327968.0,u_fwdtrek,0,1.0,False

We've both endured moving during covid and having covid, grief of many loved ones passing and our own health issues. Health issues stayed the same /increased and moving into a house from an apt bills doubled. My husband had his gallbladder removed before our move. He has a lot of undiagnosed medical issues. Such as he may need his altenoids (spelling ?) removed. He has a broken file from a root canal that may require a costly surgery to fix. He's taking monthly allergy injections as before knowing those other things we thought it was all sinus block from allergies. That being said he says it's worse at night, does anyone know why that would be? I'm wondering if he has sleep apnea or something completely different from those other issues /assumptions. I've tried to be helpful and supportive but I'm having a hard time also. I work nearly full time plus go to college consistently and he works one day a week and goes to college about one class every other semester. We had more money coming in previously as I was a caregiver and got paid for it. So he's managed his one day a week (and also a seasonal 4-6mo a year job from home ,the one day a week job is physical )but I lost my loved one and that's effected my mental health as well as our finances from caregiving which made up from his lack of hours. We've both lost insurance when he went from full time to one day. I had it on mine but didn't make enough hours at the main job to keep it (my care giving and his seasonal jobs don't provide insurance )I still do caregiving as a job job not for a relative but it's random when needed. I had an ankle injury year (torn ligament and ruptured tendons) this put me out of work over two months as my main job is very physical and I couldn't walk at all during most of thsy time. It happened on the last day of his seasonal work and his continued one day a week at the main job. All of our accounts went into the negatives and it was very stressful to the point we couldn't even buy a coffee at one point if we wanted to. We consolidated our debt since we couldn't pay the credit cards directly. I got back to work things balanced out just making it each month and now a year later and the seasonal job just ended in late February and we are back to already missing one mortgage payment since. He's not applying to many jobs and insists on getting a work from home job but hasn't applied to many or got hired. I told him about a legit company my friend did for work from home work and he didn't apply..found a doctors office hiring for a sit down reception in our town cause commuting is another no for him and he didn't even look at the listing. I'm super defeated and exhausted. Even if I work more it won't be enough. I can't support us both in this economy and I have no where else to go my families house wouldn't be suitable for me to move back into and my name is still on all our bills even if I distanced myself..he has borrowed or got given 2k from a younger relative 2 yrs ago but it seems like it only bothers me we can't pay him back and how long it's been. We also owe my mom for car parts. To pay the mortgage this month I came up with about two thirds of it with my income. The rest he paid with his four days of work and dipping into $300 we had saved towards  for something important for his elderly father. He has no plans to start work and besides the health issues listed above (which I dont think should stop him from working ?) he had no reason not to work. He is an avid gamer so his time is spent in one room by himself. His only friends are mainly gamers so thats his social life. When we worked full time together same job we went out with our friends after work. Now we don't even go out together and because he says he feels worse at night he doesn't come to bed either. He stays up (used to be 1-4 am but now  he stays up until after I leave at 5am  for my shifts I'm not sure when he goes to bed but more like 530-8am) and he wakes 1pm.to 3pm. So my nights are spent alone chatting to friends, reading or binging shows when I'm home and when I get up to leave for work he's on his computer and almost ready for bed for the day meanwhile I'm supporting us with being at my wits end with an ankle that's still busted up (hurts and gives issues still ) and he has no communication , considerstion or plans to fix his health issues , our financial problem or our relationship. Tonight I reached out to the younger relative ""we owe"" money to because he's like a brother to him and I'm hoping he can help with advice or talking to him but so far I just said I'd like to talk to him soon I didn't open it up and I'm nervous to spill personal stuff but it's better than talking to his aunt and my family doesn't interfere. What should I be doing? He won't talk to me and has nothing to say when I ask about jobs mainly shuts down or ""mhm"" ok or I'll go look now. But back in 2021 during some of my grief and mental health super lows  I called out from the main job so much (had money coming in from caregiving jobs ) but was at risk of losing the main job and he sat down like I was a child and almost demanded I get back to work or we'd be homeless (I was in bed everyday with severe anxiety and depression from so much pressure ) and now I'm just supposed to be fine when he's the one doing it although he was only employed one day a week when he made the ultimatum to me but was going in for ot cause it was summer.

Over time, we did a video call, but she never wanted to show her face, always saying her hair was messy. Later, I found out (according to her) that she had autism.

Our conversations were kind of one-sided. We planned to meet at the park, but she canceled saying she hurt her leg. She told me I was treating her differently after she revealed personal things. She said her ex had abandoned her, and that she’d been seeing another guy but got dumped.

One day, after I was mugged and nearly lost her number, she acted pretty indifferent and told me she wouldn’t text me unless I texted first. She’d often talk about her cats and family. She got really angry when her cousin said she used to drink with her ex.

Later, I invited her to the movies since she’d complained we never went out. At first, she said she was too shy, but after I insisted, she agreed—then the next day she asked, “Wouldn’t it be better if we were just friends?” Still, we went to the movies, kissed, and spent the afternoon like a couple.

She was always very guarded, never letting me see her phone, refusing to give me her Instagram (only sharing it after we broke up). Once at the mall, she gave me chocolate, and we went to a motel, but there she said she was too embarrassed to turn on the light. I said it was okay, but she quickly got reactive and her mood shifted.

Another time, I walked her home, but it was clear she didn’t want me to meet her family. On one occasion, her sister dropped her at my place, and when I jokingly said we didn’t go out because she was being “fussy,” she got really mad.

She once brought me chocolate, we hung out, and soon after she started talking about breaking up. She invited me to a party, then said she wasn’t going, then changed her mind again. I got annoyed and asked if she even wanted me there.

I showed up a bit early, and her sister saw me on the street and invited me up. We went to her friend’s party, where she introduced me as her boyfriend—and then, out of nowhere, she said, “Let’s download an app to find you a hot girl!”

After the party, she wanted me to sleep over, but I went home.

Following all this chaos, I called her and broke up. She cried, blocked me, and later accused me of sending her into a mental health crisis, saying I ruined her happiness. Then she messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected.

We started talking again, but while we were chatting, I found her on a dating app. She told me she was “looking for her friend’s ex.” I got angry, questioned her, and told her I loved her. She said she had been somewhere and wished I’d been there.

She called to invite me to her mom’s birthday party, but I didn’t go. Her mom even called me, asking if I loved her. Later, her mom invited me for coffee.

We started talking again, but then she told me her dad was pissed at me. I felt bad and vented online. She found out and accused me of deceiving and using her, said she acted the way she did because she was insecure, that she prayed for me every day—and then she blocked me and disappeared.

**Let’s play a game.**

Imagine you're an independent journalist, musician, coder, or quirky birdhouse influencer. You spend your days creating, hustling, and maybe even saving the internet one passionate post at a time. And suddenly—*boom*—someone loves your work and wants to donate.

But wait. Before that precious $10 hits your pocket, it’s gotta zigzag through a spaghetti mess of payment processors. PayPal takes a slice. Stripe nibbles. The bank slurps the rest. After fees, delays, and ""compliance reviews,"" you’re lucky if you can afford half a cup of fancy coffee.

**Enter: the Bitcoin Donate Button.**

Now available from the delightful rebels at [BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/), this little digital widget is here to do one thing and do it brilliantly: cut out the meddling middlemen and let you receive Bitcoin donations directly—fast, borderless, and censorship-resistant.

Let’s unpack this beautiful rebellion in 1,000-ish words of cheeky wit, digital empowerment, and possibly the best crypto love story never told.

# The Middleman: Friend or Foe?

We’ve been told middlemen are necessary. That they “protect” us from fraud, help us manage risk, and ensure a “smooth user experience.” But let’s be real—they’re just really good at skimming off the top while pretending to offer value.

Middlemen are the digital toll collectors of the internet economy. You know, those guys who show up when you're just trying to share a music track or raise funds for your podcast about conspiracy theories and coffee shops. Suddenly, there’s a platform demanding 2.9% plus 30 cents, a review delay, or even worse—an account freeze due to ""suspicious activity."" (Spoiler alert: it was your friend in Argentina trying to donate $3.)

With Bitcoin, none of that matters. It doesn’t ask who you are, where you're from, or whether your PayPal account is ""verified."" It’s peer-to-peer. Borderless. Instant. And gloriously out of reach of third-party meddling.

Now, all you need is a donate button powered by—say it with us—**Bitcoin.**

# What Is This Magical Donate Button?

It’s a beautifully simple, plug-and-play button that you can drop onto your site, blog, project page, or livestream like hot sauce on a burrito. It creates a clickable QR code or Bitcoin address where your adoring fans (or rich uncles) can send Bitcoin directly to you.

No logins. No paperwork. No ""terms of service"" nonsense.

Just sweet, sweet sats flowing from one digital wallet to another—yours.

You can try it right now, even if your tech skills rank somewhere between ""grandma learning WhatsApp"" and ""I once reset a router.""

Here’s the magic link:  
👉 [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/)

# Why You’ll Love It (and Why Your Future Self Will Thank You)

# 🔒 Sovereignty over Censorship

Tired of tip jars that come with terms and conditions longer than the Iliad? Our donate button doesn’t care what your blog is about. Whether you're teaching permaculture, writing sci-fi fan fiction, or streaming late-night coding sessions, this button doesn’t judge. It just works.

# 🌎 Global Donations, No Boundaries

Your fans in Nairobi, Buenos Aires, or Kyoto can now send you value instantly. Bitcoin doesn’t believe in borders, exchange rates, or international wire transfer fees. It’s like the universal translator of generosity.

# ⏱️ Real-Time Gratitude

Donations hit your wallet fast—no “pending” screens or “please allow 3-5 business days.” When someone hits that button, your wallet goes *cha-ching* and your heart does a little happy dance.

# 💸 Zero Fees. Maximum Feels.

Okay, technically there’s the Bitcoin network fee (paid by the sender), but there’s no middleman siphoning off your hard-earned donations. You keep what you earn. Radical, right?

# Who’s It For?

* **Content Creators**: Musicians, YouTubers, Twitch streamers, TikTok theorists—get paid for your genius without giving 10% to some mega-corp.
* **Developers**: Working on open-source tools or side projects? Let the community chip in with sats, not just GitHub stars.
* **Activists & Journalists**: Speak truth to power without worrying if your bank will block your next crowdfund.
* **Memers & Mischief Makers**: Get rewarded in Bitcoin for your dankest memes. It’s only fair.

Basically, if you’ve got an audience and a dream, this button is your crypto-powered tip jar of justice.

# But… Is It Easy?

Absolutely. We made it grandma-proof.

Here’s how it works:

1. Go to [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/)
2. Enter your Bitcoin address (from any wallet you control).
3. Customize your button. Add a message like “Support My Journey” or “Feed the Coffee Monster.”
4. Copy the HTML code.
5. Paste it into your site, blog, Substack, Notion page, or wherever you hang out online.

Done. Live. Ready for magic.

No APIs. No OAuth. No tech headaches. It’s as easy as copy, paste, and prosper.

# But What About Taxes, Anonymity, and Compliance?

Alright, legal eagle, we hear you.

* **Anonymity**: You *can* stay pseudonymous if you want. That’s the beauty of Bitcoin. Just don’t post your home address right next to your donation button.
* **Taxes**: In most jurisdictions, donations are taxable if you’re receiving them for work or projects. Talk to your accountant. Or, at the very least, your spreadsheet.
* **Compliance**: This isn’t a money-laundering tool. It’s a gratitude enhancer. Use it responsibly. Be cool.

# The Bigger Picture: Decentralized Generosity

This isn’t just about tech. It’s about values.

In a world of deplatforming, gatekeeping, and algorithmic nonsense, we believe people should be able to support each other directly. No friction. No fuss. No suits taking their cut.

The Bitcoin Donate Button is a small, subversive act of financial independence. It says:

""I see you. I appreciate you. And I’d rather give my Bitcoin to YOU than to another tech monopoly.""

That’s powerful.

That’s the future.

And it starts right now—on your website, with a few lines of code and a whole lot of freedom.

# Ready to Unleash the Sats?

Let’s recap:

* No middleman.
* No fees.
* No gatekeepers.
* Yes Bitcoin.
* Yes instant donations.
* Yes to YOU being in control.

All it takes is one little button. Try it today at

but i had to miss a month of class due to a family emergency so when i came back, it was harder to talk to people again. anyways, i always make eye contact on accident. 

i was working at my coffee job which is nearby the college and she came in with her friends. and i felt really embarrassed for some reason so i kind of avoided being on the register and was just making drinks. she did recognize me quickly and smiled and waved so i do feel like she at least likes me? 

when i made her drink, i wanted to write her name with a heart (could be interpreted in a friendly manner) but i realized when making her friends drink (also my classmates) it would look weird so i didnt. but before she left she smiled and waved again. 

shes so pretty 😭😭😭 i just cant look or talk to her. when she looks at me i feel like running away. our class is ending soon so i really want to at the very least, be friends with her. i just cant tell if shes interested in me in more than a friend.",1,1746327512.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

Looking around the laboratory she didn’t know what time it was. She’d been working for what felt like days. Looking to her left she saw many empty cups of coffee. The other side of her workstation had many bottles of potions. 

That’s when she got her idea. A way to get many willing ~~guinea pigs~~ participants. She grabbed her journal, put the potions in her alchemy belt and walked out of the laboratory. The extremely tired Mandy walked into the bathroom with a heavy sigh. She started to fix her hair, pulling out a feather from her ginger hair. 

After that she walked downstairs and noticed the end tables, she looked at it lazily. She pointed her hand at it and clenched it hard. The white part of her hair glowed as a white, semi-translucent hand folated out of her fist and grabbed the leg of the end table. Mandy walked out of the cabin with the hand pulling the end table behind her.

She put the end table in front of her and placed all her potions on the table. Practically beaming at the possibility of getting more research on her potions. 

“Potions get your potions here! Try a potion for free! Want to turn into an animal? Then step right up!” She shouted so loud the gods could hear her. Luckily it was noon so she shouldn’t be waking anyone up.

And apologies in advance if this post turns out to be an obnoxious length. However, it is only because I will try to be as thorough as possible with details and context.

Stats and context:

Male, 33, 6'1, 185-195 lbs (and haven't moved from this range in years), caucasian, do not drink but did socially from age 21-27 and only occasional drink now, smoked socially for about 5 years mostly via ""bumming"" (no where near pack-year levels), vaped a few times. I've taken pantoprazole 40mg on and off over the years to manage my acid reflux. No other meds.

I'm also a military vet and have deployed to Afghanistan. No long term, immediate burn pit exposure, though I have been semi-close to them 3 or 4 times for periods of 20 minutes or less, if I had to estimate.

I run about 20 miles a week and in the gym 3 times a week, but otherwise I have had a pretty sedentary lifestyle in recent years due to university (kind of a forever student) and work.

And to be honest, this recent year has been one of the most stressful and anxiety ridden i've ever experienced, for a whole mix of professional, personal, and relationship reasons, and not sure how well I managed that stress and anxiety.

Primary issue:

Intermittent chest discomfort, a twitch or stitch-like feeling, light pinches, (left and right, sternum area and sometimes flanks). This is accompanied recently by air hunger, hoarseness/weak voice, sour, metallic taste in mouth, constantly inflamed and red tonsils and surrounding area in mouth, tickle in throat (I don't have a persistent cough, it's only in response to the tickle when I do cough), and a feeling like my diaphragm area is ever so subtly grating on the left side. When I take deep breaths in, my sternum area usually always clicks and pops, and my spine at the same level, sometimes clicks and pops. With the exception of chest discomfort which i've felt on and off throughout the years, all of the other symptoms basically appeared around 5-ish weeks ago, I think. Finally, my limbs, particularly my legs have felt pressurized and can see it in the veins, makes trying to sleep difficult, feels like restless legs. The left leg this happened in Nov. and the right leg more recently. I've been feeling head pressure recently as well, like I have a band around my head. Then also recently what I think are bone aches and random muscle aches, bowel irregularities, fatigue, and then brain fog like i've never experienced before. I also currently have a 4 week old still only partially healed burn on my hand, about an inch long and .5 inch wide. My diet the last 6 weeks has been insanely strict, and for drink water and matcha tea and occasionally a coffee, that's it.

I'm posting because i'm at all loss as to the direction I need to go next. The collection of symptoms are hard to ignore, but it's been difficult to continue to push for answers and direction.

Here are all the tests i've had done since July 2024 chasing this situation down, which at that time was very mild compared to recent developments:

\-July 2024, chest x ray, blood, and ECG - clear and normal

\- Nov 2024, throat and neck CT and blood - clear and normal (noted tops of lungs as ""predominantly clear""

\-Nov 2024, abdominal and pelvic MRI - clear, nothing remarkable.

\-Jan 2025, Nasal and throat endoscopy - nothing abnormal

\-April 2025, chest x ray and abdominal ultrasound - normal and clear; my WBC in my blood work here was two whole numbers lower than NOV, however still within ""normal"" range.

\-I also have an infected tooth that is schedule to be extracted this coming week. Said tooth was already refill August 2024.

\-I've also asked my PCP for an autoimmune blood panel, but hasn't responded yet.

\-I am supposed to have an endoscopy soon, but need cardio to clear me first, since i've been complaining of chest discomfort.

My anxiety about this has flatlined because at this point I just want to figure this out. I am concerned though about my throat and chest/lungs and head, to be honest. But all the recent imaging suggests I shouldn't be. I want to chalk this up to a mix of acid and silent reflex and Costochondritis, but i'm not ready to settle on that yet, especially given the weird stuff like fatigue and brain fog and dizziness. And my run today felt more difficult comparatively, because of chest tightness.

1ke9pzw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ke9pzw,Help me find the perfect Mother’s Day Nespresso gift (and something for myself too 😅),"Hi everyone!

I’m on the hunt for the perfect Mother’s Day gift and I think Nespresso might be the answer — but I’m new to this world and would love your help!

A little background: I only drink instant Nescafe Gold decaf (please don’t judge lol). I’m strictly a latte person, always with almond or oat milk. I honestly just like the taste of that specific coffee in my lattes.

Now my mom? Total opposite. She’s a real coffee lover — grinds her beans fresh, uses filters and fancy little mesh things, and drinks only pure, strong coffee in tiny cups that smell like rocket fuel to me (in a good way, I think? lol). Sometimes she adds a spoon of heavy cream, but that’s it.

The issue is, lately she’s been way too busy in the mornings and doesn’t have time for her usual brewing ritual. I’ve noticed she’s been just pouring hot water over ground coffee in a cup, and let’s just say… cleaning out dried coffee sludge from those mugs every day is not my favorite thing.

So! I’m hoping to find a Nespresso machine that:
	•	Is super convenient and quick in the mornings.
	•	Has pods similar to Nescafe Gold decaf for me (ideally decaf options that work well with milk).
	•	Has blonde/light roast-style pods that taste good black for my mom — she actually liked my Nescafe Gold once, so maybe there’s hope!

Also, I tried browsing the Nespresso website but it keeps glitching (maybe because of the 30% off sale?), so I checked Walmart instead and these are the models they currently have available. Can any of these work for both our needs?

Available models:

	•	Nespresso New Vertuo Next 19-Bar, 1-Cup Black Espresso Machine

	•	Nespresso Vertuo Pop by De’Longhi Coffee and Espresso Maker with Coffee Tasting Set, Black

	•	Nespresso Vertuo Plus Coffee and Espresso Maker by De’Longhi, Black

	•	Nespresso By De’Longhi New Vertuo Next Premium Coffee and Espresso Maker in Chrome + Aeroccino3 Milk Frother (I don't need frother tbh 😅)

	•	Breville New Nespresso Vertuo Plus Deluxe in Piano Black

	•	VertuoPlus New Coffee and Espresso Machine by De’Longhi, Limited Edition, Black Matte

	•	Nespresso Bundle: Vertuo Line POP Machine + Starbucks Sunsera Coffee Capsules

Would any of these be a good fit for a latte-lover (me) and a black coffee purist (my mom)? Should I be looking at Original line instead of Vertuo?

Thanks so much in advance — I’d love any tips on machines, pods, or even what NOT to buy!

P.s. I have my own nano foamer I'm pretty happy with, so I believe I don't need any kind of latte/frother attachment, just a machine and that is all 😅",1,1746326626.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

• The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.

5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.

7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.

• It's recommended to use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.

• Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

I'm a pretty heavy coffee addict but the problem is that coffee makes my tummy rumble.

While I was writing my book I ordered an ice caramel macchiato and shortly after drinking it I began to pass a lot of gas

I was trying to hide it but I did the thing where I lifted my leg up like an animal to let it escape but in doing so the person sitting next to me threw up on her table. 

I gave her a concerned look as if I didn't just propell weaponized gas at her face, but I felt bad so I got up to go get her some paper towels, but while I was walking back I tried to let out another fart but everything inside me exploded out through my shorts and on the floor? I felt my body levitate for a quick second kinda like I was wearing a jetpack. Happened between the songs they play so I tried to play it off like it was the beginning of the next song by clapping but this just made everyone in the cafe look at me

I tried to smile and play it off like I didn't just propell shit out of my ass and have it explode on the floor of the cafe and but the woman who threw up had a horrified look on her face which i didnt understand because I was clapping. So next I tried to smile and wave but I tripped and landed in the streak of excrement which apparently was on one of the walls now.

At this point I went into fight or flight mode and ran out of the cafe.

I tried to go back the next day and apologize because I figured this kinda thing happens to everyone, but they have a picture of me from security footage laying in a pool of shit saying that I'm not welcome back? 

I'm thinking of suing the established because clearly something is wrong with the coffee? I don't know how I'm supposed to finish my manuscript now if I'm banned from my favorite cafe? I know everyone will tell me to lay off the coffee but I'm kinda addicted 😅

1ke9jly,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalillness/comments/1ke9jly/ocd_and_lovelimerance/,OCD and love/limerance,"This got really long. Probably way too detailed, but I need to finally tell SOMEBODY this shit. Sorry.


Context: I(M20s) have clinically diagnosed OCD, MDD, social anxiety, and generalized anxiety, all untreated. Probably undiagnosed autism and/or adhd. I've had multiple episodes of psychosis that health care just chock up to weed. Victim? of COCSA. Narcissistic mom, chronically depressed(and angry) father. Long story ""short"", dating is fucking hard. Had one 4ish month relationship in high school, over 10 years ago. Only tried dating 2 other times between then and this incident, ghosted after several weeks both times. First wasn't just once but 3 times.


ANYWAY, I met a wonderful woman(20s) through work a few years ago, and we got along really well. Both of us were viahmetly opposed to co-worker relationships, so at first it was easy.  Before she left, however, I fell HARD, and we stayed in touch after she left. A few months after she left I eventually got the nerve to ask her out for a morning coffee, and to my surprise she said yes. 


In a disastrous turn of events my elderly dog had a health scare the weekend before(date was set for Monday. He was okay). Upon reading the text from my family saturday morning, I cried until I puked and then drove 3 hours straight to my parents. Didn't get back to my place until about 10-11PM Sunday, and didn't sleep for shit all night. I did, however, sleep through my fucking alarm and accidently stood her up. Woke up, saw the time, saw her missed messages, and died inside. I apologized perfusely but didn't hear anything back. Next day I just went to where we planned to meet in hopes shed be there, and when I turned the corner her car was there. Being completely unprepared for anything good to actually happen to me, I freaked the fuck out and just drove by, eventually prepared myself for a good, much deserved, slap and circled back but she was gone. Still didnt hear anything that day, and spent the whole time debating if it was remotely appropriate to even be trying to catch her there. I decided it was at least probably legal, and worth the civil consequences so tried again the next morning. 


Aaand, it fucking worked. She was ordering when I walked in, so didn't see me right away, but when I told her she wasn't getting away without me making good on my promise to buy her a coffee she turned around and seemed to light up. We sat down, had a great talk, caught up from her last day at work etc. Planned a repeat. Repeat went swimmingly as well, and this went on for a few days. 


Eventually we made weekend plans, and I thought that went pretty swimmingly as well. It seemed like she actually liked me, and we spent most of the day together. I was unfortunately obsessing over whether she saw these as date dates or friend dates though, but was too scared to ask. The next weekend we had another big day, and at the end of it I really wanted to go in for a hug or kiss, or just ask what was up, but AGAIN I was too fucking scared. Thats the last time I saw her. She started flaking on every plan, and eventually just... *poof*.


My life really went to shit after that. I had to make the decision to put my dog down, on the phone with my crying sibling, while tripping on a large dose of magic mushrooms. As if that wasnt bad enough, I had to practically fucking beg my dad to let him go for days, after years of being told by dad ""I can't wait for your dog to die"", because he was helping my mom cope with a terminal illness. I had started a new job, my contract was coming up and my managers hadn't said anything about it. There was talk of outsourcing my job. A much older coworker(F50s, lets call her N) had asked me out before (F20s, lets call her S) ghosted me, which I declined but N kept trying even after I blocked her phone number. After S ghosted me N escalated to starting legal procedures claiming my boss encouraged ME to ask HER out, along with some other shit. Had a meeting with the company's lawyers lined up for weeks, stressing me the fuck out the whole time(N ended up getting fired, thankfully). Somebody tried to steal my car and caused $1k in damage. I was in fucking hell. Then, S got back in touch. Told me she had relapsed, her dream job had fallen through, and she left the state. We exchanged a few texts, but I said some stupid shit trying to make her feel better about the job not working out and she vanished again. I tried my best to forget her, but it just didn't work. I deleted her contact, but I couldn't forget her number. I tried to delete my memory with alcohol to no avail, apparently waking up still shitfaced for work gets trumped by the obsessive part of OCD. I kept up with the occasional texts, wishing her a happy birthday or just random well wishes, to no avail.


A few months later I started really struggling with psychotic symptoms. It devolved to a point where I was barely sleeping, and eventually peaked with a 5 day stint in which I slept maybe an hour a night. We had a training at work 2 days in that I couldn't even pay attention to. Going into the weekend my roommate(M20s, let's say P) and I went back to where S and I had our first weekend date(S and I were there in the summer, P and I were skiing). I felt like I was tripping without having taken any drugs. Reality meant nothing, I was convinced the entire time that P was going to just leave me there, or even kill me. At one point I ended up pretty far ahead of P, with nobody else around, and for about 45 seconds I was POSITIVE every person on the planet except myself had just disappeared. When we were leaving, traffic was backed up. I was freaking the fuck out in my head, P said something about happy thoughts so I forced myself to think happy thoughts and the traffic immediately cleared up, which made me spiral even more. I think I held it together pretty well, P asked why I was so quiet but that was it. When we got home he seemed to vanish, and I was convinced he had. Sorry, more context, one of my 3 best friends in Preschool was also named P. We went to different primary schools, and then his family moved in 2nd grade. In 9th grade he committed suicide. In my head it made more sense that I had died and was meeting P in the afterlife or something, it doesn't make sense now obviously but it was SO FUCKING REAL in the moment. The next day I still hadn't slept, and I ended up driving home to my parents. Huge chunks of the drive just vanished from my memory, at one point I 'woke up', didn't recognize where I was at all, and became SURE I'd missed the exit(I hadnt). Mom and dad were unhelpful at best, but my grandmother was a therapist so dad drove me over there. On the ride over I legitimately felt like I could just die if I wanted to. My hands ACTUALLY went numb, comfortably numb kind of numb. I didnt tell my parents or grandma about that, but she brought me to the ER, where I was given some mild sleeping pills and sent home where I slept for 16 hours straight. I had exactly 1 dream, in which S was sitting with me on my grandmother's couch, and she just asked me if I was okay. I did actually feel a lot better when I woke up.


2 months after that, 80% of my department got laid off, and I had to take on a bunch more workload. It seemed like we were making a comeback, and there was talk of hiring new people or people back(if they wanted). Until exactly 1 year, to the fucking day, since I saw S. Went into work feeling pretty bummed, then the CEO brought me into his office and told me my entire department was getting the axe. I immediately headed over to my last job, where I'd met S. It had been an amicable departure of ways, and I started back up the following day. 2 months after that I drove by the place I'd last seen S for the first time since. I was a complete and utter wreck by the time I got home, but I was resolute to not give into the compulsion to text her. To my absolute shock though, she texted me that night. 


Weve been texting regularly since, but she lives 1000 miles away and has a girlfriend. I'm beyond devastated, I've never felt like this about somebody. Every time we had a date, on the way there I felt like I was going to puke, but that would vanish the second I saw her. The only people I feel as comfortable with as her are my friends of 15-20+ years. I really thought she felt, at least close, to the same way, but I didnt want to lose her by trying to ask for more and being wrong. I still want to tell her just how much she means to me, but I feel like it would be inappropriate. I just dont know what I'm doing, what I'm supposed to do, what's fucking wrong with me, why I have to be such a fucking freak.

**The Packout**

[T22 Fully Packed Out](https://preview.redd.it/50pycb3z1oye1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b04cb19d7b08a1cbfcee674346486ef7f1630502)

A few notes about the configuration I went for on this trip and what I carried

Main Compartment:

* Medium compression packing cube with all my clothing for 2 days + pajamas.
* Small toiletry kit
* Emergency travel cube pouch (happy to talk more about this cube if anyone is interested)
* Small tech kit
* Anker Soundcore Life Q30 Noise Cancelling Headphones

Tech Compartment:

* Nothing. I was traveling with just an iPad mini this time.

Hatch:

* Deck of cards
* Notebook + pen
* Keys on the leash
* Disinfecting wipes

Across my chest, I carried the Alpaka Flight Sling 2L (*side note: this sling was the MVP of my trip and the best purchase I made this year*):

* iPad mini with pencil in Tomtoc case
* 10,000 mAh MagSafe battery pack + short USB c charging cable
* Cell phone
* A couple bandaids
* Microfiber cloth for glasses and electronics + a couple lens wipes
* Wallet
* Hand sanitizer, gum, and breath spray
* Loop Experience earplugs
* Sunglasses

**Experience**

I ended up having to carry the T22 fully packed out all day for 2.5 days because I had to switch hotels each night, so it was a perfect stress and security test to carry it all over San Francisco and the Bay Area. After carrying it non-stop for 2.5 days at a conference, to restaurants, through airports, and in various Ubers, I have some thoughts.

[T22 Under Plane Seat Like a Champ](https://preview.redd.it/vx29tj2t5oye1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ce6bec24211f8f2598612da2ae7d725ba75366c)

*The Joyful Experiences*:

* The **mesh zipper pocket** inside the main compartment is great! I couldn't carry my traditional tech kit this time if I wanted to keep the bag in unexpanded mode (more on that later), so I just put all my tech stuff together in there and it became a little tech pouch.
* I love that the **two mesh pockets on the back wall** of the main compartment perfectly fit a pair of over-the-ear headphones. It kept them out of the way and safe from being crushed, while still being easily accessible.
* I love all the **strap keepers/dangle stoppers**. Kept the straps from wandering out into the aisle on the plane and from catching on things while navigating crowded streets and restaurants.
* I love how **compact** the bag is and it was nice to not have to worry about bumping into people or snagging on anything.
* Incredibly **comfortable harness system**...with a caveat (more on that later). It's hard to find bags that are comfortable for women and this one is one of the best I've encountered.
* **The hatch** became more useful than I imagined while trying to quickly grab things on the plane and in Ubers.
* The **top handle** is a joy to use.
* It's a **conversation starter without being flashy**. I had a few people ask me about it because they've never seen a bag like it. You meet bag nerds everywhere! And while it does start conversations sometimes, mostly it's a very anonymous black bag and it doesn't scream ""please rob me!"" That was a huge bonus and made me feel safe while wearing it. 

*The Experiences That Gave Me Pause:*

* Yep, this is me circling back to the **expansion system**. I don't know if it's just my bag but the expansion system is so cumbersome to use. The zipper gets caught at the seams near the bottom of the bag where the bottom material meets the main body material. It takes a lot of fiddling to get the zipper past that point. I chose to leave my bag in unexpanded mode to avoid the headache. It also makes it so you can't use the hydrolock if it's expanded (at least, I couldn't get it to work in expanded mode).
* In theory the **hydrolock** is a great idea, but it's a pain to clip into place. It took me a good five minutes the first time I deployed it to get all 3 clips aligned and click them into place. It's easier when the bag is empty, but then it compromises access to the main compartment. If you're going to use it, I'd just leave it deployed all the time and just get used having less access on that side. I tend to just put my bottle in the main compartment when I'm carrying it in EDC situations.
* The **harness system** is excellent, but I noticed that when the bag was fully packed out, the shoulder straps tended to slide to the outside of my shoulder instead of staying firmly in the middle of the shoulder like it does when it's just packed out for EDC use. This is a common issue I have encountered with harness systems that seem to be designed and tested more with male frames (or broader shoulders) instead of female frames. It's not a knock against Fyro. It happens with Aer, Minaal, Cotopaxi, etc. I am sure Fyro had some female testers. I just hope that it's something that companies consider a little more in the future. I got around this by clipping the sternum strap when I was going to be wearing the bag for long periods, but it does put quite a bit of strain on the sternum strap--to the point where it made it hard to unclip it. I had to sort of do a hunch to bring the shoulder straps closer together so I could unclip. Just something to consider.

**Verdict**

Overall, I really love the T22. The issues I've encountered with it have been very minor and are in no way deal breakers for me, and I wanted to share my good and bad experiences so they might be helpful to someone else. It's a great first bag from a new company.

all he was if that makes any sense. his character feels like it’s hanging on by a thread right now. it’s all over the place 

like okay. ⚠️ spoilers ahead ⚠️ 

besides the affair being so completely outta pocket and senseless cause he just met her allen’s call for justice doesnt seem all the way there if that makes any sense 

like sure he wants to catch the “bad guy” at the end of the day but it seems like just another job for him compared to everyone else. like allen just feels so out of place sometimes. like someone plopped him into the team and he stayed 

idk idk idk maybe this is what mads was talking about when he was saying he had a hard time grasping the character at first 

like allen is a whole detective sergeant but it doesn’t feel natural at all (sometimes… most times…)

also ignore typos i’m not going back 😭😭😭

First of all, I had my gallbladder removed 20 years ago, and I've never had any issues until now. I mention gallbladder because the pain I have been experiencing is dead center in my upper stomach--just where I used to feel gallbladder pain years ago. Here is a basic list of what is happening:  The moment I put anyting in my mouth--doesn't seem to be connected to a type of food--I swear the gurgling begins. It's like the saliva triggers it because it will start before I even swallow the food. I have a combination of gurgling, gassy pain with more of a constant ache in my upper gut. I find myself not wanting to swallow my food--almost with a bit of nausea at this point--so I chew and chew and chew and finally cross my fingers and swallow.  This level of intensity is not how things began weeks ago, and I certainly am not bed ridden or anything. I just got back from meeting a friend for dinner, and I couldn't eat my meal. As well, I've actually woken up twice this past week out of a dead sleep at night with stomach discomfort.  It doesn't seem to change a lot when sitting, standing, or being flat. Letting time go by with no food eventually settles the situation. Lastly, even my one morning cup of coffee is triggering pain. Thanks for reading everything. I know I need to get to the doctor, but I'm dreading the financial rabbit hole I feel I'm about to go down even with insurance. I'll take any tips or trick on how to help this uncomfortable situation. ",1,1746325501.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

Favorite game?
Godzilla or robocop? 

I like games and play on Xbox and PlayStation. Space Marine 2 and Destiny and helldivers 2 are my go-to games. I enjoy shooters and action games and the occasional city builder or rts on pc. Any recommendations are welcome. I'm excited for the new Doom game. Will also be down playing games if we hit it off.

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

Was a huge reader until the fire nation blessed me with sudden ADD or HD or 8k or whatever. Still have the Dune sequels to read. Big warhammer 40k novel enjoyer too.

Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I mainly listen to rock and metal. But I do on occasion listen to the Macarena and Barbie girl as I shower or cook. Zeppelin, the doors and a myriad of other classic bands are always playing.

I like coffee too. Preferably caramel. Also a redbull fan. I can drink many of those. Probably shouldn't since I don't think that's medically sound.

Pretty much looking for some fun and maybe make a friend in the process. I like to think I'm a decent conversationalist but who knows. Not sure if this is enticing so far.


Huh, I honestly don't know what else to say. This is honestly so difficult.

I would just want someone around my age and be an actual real person. My luck hasn't been great at all. Someone should change that.

I'm also very sarcastic and I try to be funny. I fail. Fail a lot. But I do try. I like to think I'm nice.

And also has been breeding people raw while on a cruise and he's not on prep. Now, we're both tops. But he says he has ulcerative colitis so he can't bottom (much to my dismay). I've been toying with the idea of bottoming for him, but also he knows I'd only do that with a condom. I always bring my own condoms to a hook-up/date. I don't trust guys like that.

We met up twice (once a coffee shop, the second at his place for handjobs) before he went on a month long cruise. Turns out during the cruise he's been fucking two different guys raw whenever he can. He said he hasn't been on prep despite getting it before the cruise. He said that it makes you feel like shit and he didn't want to feel like shit during his cruise so he'll start it after the cruise. He also told me he's on roids fore body building (that man is jacked). All this time I thought he was natural but just was really dedicated. I've got a pretty muscular body too. I even had a body-building coach tell me I had the potential to compete. Even the guy in question says he loves my lat spread. So I am no slouch in the gym whatsoever. But, you always see a guy you're attracted to and compare yourself. Also I've never bottomed for anyone before and he knows this. I'm a top, so bottoming for someone with a thick cock and a dick piercing would be many firsts for me.

He's also expressed interest in seeing me again and me bottoming for him. Said he wants to ""tear me open"". I think the guy is hot. He thinks my skin is pretty and my body is goregous. And he seems down to indulge in all the kinks/stuff I named. So the sexual chemistry is certainly there. But knowing that he's raw breeding strangers with no condom and no prep is making me do a double take for everything. Which sucks because we actually get along and he seems like a nice guy. And I was really thinking about bottoming for him. He definitely seemed interested in meeting me in a non-sexual environment. Like we can just talk and laugh.

So…I’m (F22) a senior in college here at UNCW. I never really had that many friends growing up and had a not-so-good experience in high school. I really expected college to be my turn around. I transferred from community college to UNCW. I hit the ground running and was absolutely determined to make at least one friend. I attended so many events, joined clubs I was interested in, attempted to talk to classmates, even went to bars and coffee shops by myself, and…I have literally no friends. Like, zero. I saw a TikTok of graduating seniors all gathering at a bar nearby for funny graduation pictures and I literally burst into tears because I know I will never have that. My anxiety is just getting worse and worse and so is my depression. I just don’t know what else to do. I have done everything to make friends and I feel so pathetic because I crave friendship so badly. Everything I do in Wilmington, I have to do alone and it’s so painful.

I feel like I’m the only person here that hates it and I really don’t want to feel that way. Every day that I come here is a day of literally just surviving. I like my professors and my degree, but I literally have made zero friends. I still have a year and a half here because I changed my major and I’m dreading it at this point.

This one’s for the baristas, bartenders, and waitstaff across Australia,busting their guts through hectic shifts, making every punter’s day, only to see their bank balance and want to cry. Hospitality is the lifeblood of our towns and cities, but the pay? It’s an absolute shit show.

You’re up before the sun for a 5 AM cafe start or slogging through til midnight in a busy bar, dodging “one more round” shouts from rowdy tables. You’re nailing orders like a memory champ, charming your way through Karen’s complaints, and keeping the good vibes going, even when the kitchen’s in meltdown. All for what? A base award rate of $23.23 an hour for a Level 1 hospo worker? Sounds alright until you’re trying to afford rent in Sydney or Melbourne, where a one-bedroom flat can sting you for $600 a week.

And let’s talk about those $10 flat whites, predicted to hit by 2030, but already creeping up to $8 or $9 in some spots. You’re pulling those coffees, yet your wage barely keeps up with the price of milk. Penalty rates for nights and weekends? Bosses find ways to skimp on those, leaving you short. Casual gigs mean no sick leave, no job security, and rosters that flip faster than a Bondi wave. Tipping? Yeah, nah—unlike the States, it’s not part of the deal here, so you’re stuck relying on that base wage while the cost of living goes through the roof.

We’re not “just hospo workers.” We’re the heart of your local cafe, the legends slinging your arvo pints, the ones making your mate’s engagement dinner one to remember. But while venues cash in on $25 burgers and those soon-to-be $10 coffees, workers are left with crumbs. No super for casuals under 18 hours, no paid leave, and try getting a breather when you’re rostered six days straight.

This industry thrives on us. From Cairns to Tassie, Aussies live for their brekkie spots, pubs, and restaurants. So why are we paid like it’s still the early 2000s? A living wage isn’t asking for the moon, it’s what we deserve for keeping Australia’s social scene pumping. Next time you’re at your local, have a chat with the staff and ask: why’s the system still shafting us? Share this if you’re fed up seeing hospo workers run into the ground for bugger-all.

1ke8t0l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ke8t0l,"Signed Book 76: The Spirit of Lagaan – Aamir Signature, Oscars, and a Dash of Cricketing Spirit!","Continuing from yesterday’s Oscar-flavored pick, today’s book is another gem from the 'Lagaan' era—The Spirit of Lagaan by Satyajit Bhatkal. This one too carries the signature of Aamir Khan, alongside the author’s, dated 15 April 2002—just about a month after the Oscar rollercoaster. I imagine both were still nursing their post-Oscar hangover, but had enough spirit left to pen and sign this wonderful behind-the-scenes peek into one of India’s most beloved films.

The book itself is an easy, breezy read—less textbook, more coffee chat with someone who’s been in the thick of it all. Satyajit, who was the on-set chronicler of Lagaan, takes you through the sweat, drama, cricket injuries, dust storms, last-minute rewrites, and the sheer madness of making a period sports drama in rural Gujarat. You get a real sense of how audacious the whole thing was—and how infectious Aamir’s determination must’ve been.

For a film that made fans cheer, cry, and scream “Howzzat!” from theatre seats, this book adds depth to the magic. It’s not just about the match—it’s about the matchstick spark behind it. The quizzer in me picked up a few fun facts, but mostly, I just enjoyed soaking in the vibe of a team that believed in an impossible dream.

Picked up from my long-time Instagram-based book dealer, Bookhub_01, this signed copy is now a prized part of my collection. The Spirit of Lagaan is very much alive on my shelf—now with two signatures and a whole lot of heart.",6,1746323513.0,Indianbooks,0,1.0,False
1ke8se3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ke8se3/wife_cheated_getting_divorced_feels_like_i_could/,"Wife cheated, getting divorced- feels like I could have done something sooner.","It has been two weeks. Two weeks since my life imploaded around me.

 

I [28M] found the texts. My “loving wife” [26F], of 2.5 years together for 6. who had been increasingly distant and hard to connect with since the new year had in fact been having an affair. An Emotional one, seeing as she and the partner have never met in person, live half a continent and a whole country away, but one charged with  very graphic sexts, images and plans. Plans for her to leave me and pursue their relationship. I merely updated the timeline by a month.

I have been equal parts, hollow, angry, desperate, depressed, tired and lonely in the days since. When I confronted her, she immediately started to pack. I begged her to try and fix things but there was nothing I could do. Even now…. With the benefit of hindsight id probably take her back if I could.

Someone of you might be going wow OP, that’s pathetic. And yeah…. Yeah, its kind of is. My friends and family have rallied around me, and even her family have had to admit that it came out of no where.

But looking back and with knowledge I now have it definitely didn’t. I just didn’t think it would come to this.

When we first started dating. She had just turned 18. And I had just turned 21. I was working a full time job and going to school full time, while still somehow making time to be a youth group leader and see my friends. 2018 had been a rough year for me emotionally. Between April and August of that year I had attended 7 weddings of close friends and 1 family member. I was in 3 of those wedding parties.

Ill admit I was lonely. I opened tinder, early in June and one of the first girls I saw was someone I recognized. She went to the same school as me, but was a few years behind me. And we went to the same church. She was a youth group leader with one of my best female friends, whose own wedding had kicked off the 2018 summer of weddings back in April.

I kind of knew her, but again I didn’t spend time looking at girls still in HS. Her profile showed she was 18. And I paid to super swipe….. I was in church at the time actually.

And low and behold she liked me back… from the other side of the auditorium. Chatted briefly and quickly organized a date.

Coffee date, near to the church (NOT the same day) it went well. I got there an hour early, nervous as hell. And stress ate an entire massive cinnamon bun before she walked in 20 min early. And laughed.

Found out that she had kind of already had a crush on me, based on our limited time together as youth group leaders. She was flattered by my offer, but She was going to be doing a high intensity two year course in animation at a local prestigious film school and thus didn’t have time to date anyone. I thought that was fair, I was also doing school and work and barely had time to do anything myself.

We left the “date” with each others’ numbers and an agreement to take things slow. I told one of my good friends, about it the next day, he having literally only just returned from his own honeymoon two days earlier. He laughed at me. “Nature - You are incapable of doing anything slow. And I can see it written on your face. You’ll be dating the girl before the end of the summer.”

I don’t remember what I said, but sure enough. We texted A LOT!. We hung out every spare minute of that summer, knowing that in September we would both be going back to school and would have no time.  It was so much fun, the late nights, the cute dates, baking cookies for the youth group kids, walks in the park, picnics you name it.  Took her to the aquarium and went downtown which for me is an achievement. I detest most downtown spaces.

Anyways long story short, the last pair of my friends to get married were getting married in the middle of August. And I wanted to invite her to be my plus one. The bride, my friend refused. “Unless Your dating her then absolutely not. Also, I don’t know her.”

To rectify the second issue, I organized a double date to the park and then movies the following Saturday. They became good friends quickly. And I received a nod, a conditional allowance as long as I met their first requirement. Later that night was our first kiss and on July 10th, I asked her to be my GF.

She said yes. We went on more dates; the wedding came and went and it was a blast. I introduced her to my other friends and my family and in a few short months, even as she started going to school, she became enmeshed in my life.  My friend who I had told about the taking it slow plan laughed at me outright at the last wedding of the summer.

 

Despite the challenges that fall, we still made time for eachother. On the days where I wasn’t in school, I typically worked mornings. And was thus available to pick her up and drive her home from classes.

Thought already in that first year - warning signs began to pop up. As I have now learned in the last two weeks of intensive relationship research, she has an Avoidant attachment style and I have a preoccupied-anxious style… for those of you who know attachment style research, yes I can hear your growning through the screen.

There were long periods of time, where if she was “Over stimulated” she would shut down, pull away or stonewall. And me in my 21 year old non developed frontal cortex and anxious attachment style would redouble efforts to make her smile, laugh or talk to me…. Which in hindsight only pushed her further away.  But because we lived separate lives, worked and were in school the amount of time we spent together was artificially deflated so these instances of overwhelmingness were few and far between.

Then Covid happened -  and suddenly all my course work was at your own pace, do it from home. And so was a lot of hers. So suddenly we were able to spend more time together… and I became absolutely infatuated. She was too, she told me she was in love with me way before I did. Only 4 months in, I held off until 8 month mark… because I was afraid of rushing things (LOL).

We spent more time together, and I got on her nerves. (Anxious attachment style, needing constant validation, and emotional closeness etc) so more and more there were these shut down periods. Which I didn’t know how to solve.  She attributed the shut down to her low-grade autism. We fell into a bit of the same pattern - periods of extreme closeness and fun and windows where I was persona non grata for a few days at a time. I tried to bring this up a couple of times but see previous stonewalling and inability to be vulnerable about emotional needs and boundaries. And me…. Not having any boundaries or self-respect and going along with whatever I thought she needed.

 

Next few years aren’t important -  just assume more of the same. I got a new job, paid more but was significantly more sedentary and I began to put on weight….

She graduated school, but couldn’t get a job in her field and so started drawing as a side hustle while working retail. I bought a ring, we got engaged. Her parents divorced….. suddenly she needed a place to live, because her mom was moving FAR. And her dad was downsizing to a single apartment. My grandparents stepped in, they had been planning on renting us their one floor rental apartment near to where we already both lived as a wedding gift. (significantly reduced rent as compared to local rates) we took it and moved in together. Planning the wedding and enjoying being together.

At first we tried being intimate…. But I had put on about 60 lbs and was so out of shape that I got winded and couldn’t perform very well. (Important later) so even before the wedding intimacy problems had emerged. Also living together meant that there was little to no escape from the other. Which wasn’t a problem for me, but during this time the number of stonewall/shut down events skyrocketed.

The wedding came and went and things were good for a time, the first year seemingly revitalized things… but slowly fell into old patterns. I felt alone during the long, several days sometime stonewalling periods, and intimacy fell even further, me initiating most of them, though my performance anxiety due to weight and stamina continued to plague me and I stopped initiating and then over time so did she.

Then she quit her good retail job siting mental health concerns. I had just been promoted and was making way more money and we were fine. Though I was stressed, I ve always been a bit anxious about money and suddenly being a single income house was not what I had planned. We agreed she could take the summer to refresh herself and then in the fall she would find another job.

She couldn’t drive, so the job market was limited to what she could transit too or walk which wasn’t much. We were still doing good, but I felt stressed regardless and when it was time to go back to work I pressured her… hard.

Several times she told me she didn’t like the pressure, that felt invalidating, and didn’t make her feel good. And I tried to rein in my anxiety.  Though she didn’t see the point in working because we were fine. Though things were getting a bit tighter.  I started budgeting, reducing spending and she didn’t like that. We went on fewer dates, spent more time at home “together” but not doing anything. Other issues emerged, dishes, litter boxes, garbage both of us falling on the other at points. And I felt like I had to walk on eggshells around her all the time to avoid these shutdowns.

 Intimacy fell even further when I started using porn to deal with the fact that we weren’t having intimacy (YES, I Know that’s stupid) I felt ashamed that I was using porn to substitute and that shame drove me further from intimacy, because on the few times we tried I was weighed down by thoughts of unworthiness and self disgust -  not exactly aphrodisiacs.

 

Long story short - she “Lost” feelings for me but did an expert job masking. Daily routine of hugs, kisses goodbye

 Then I lost my job, our contract was ended because my manager and the client couldn’t get along. And when contract ended in Aug, ours wasn’t renewed.  I was under a lot of stress back in Nov and took a much lower paying job. Now we were dipping into savings, so I put a lot of pressure on her to work more, and was micromanaging her art account trying to maximize money.  And she did but part time, making a little money from her side hustle as well. To the point where on the day that she left – she told me she didn’t feel safe with me, because in the back of her mind she was always concerned about when I would bring up money or her working.

 

During this time – she started hanging out more with friends she had made in a discord group chat for a piece of media we both enjoyed. And from there she would live stream her drawing and playing said media. A girl joined the livestreams and the two became fast friends. Important bit of context – my wife is Pansexual. And this friend is a lesbian.

But at the time, the lesbian was also in a relationship and even had her GF commission some art of the two of them for Valentine’s Day. But they broke up before that. The GF apparently moving away for school.

It was shortly after that the affair began, I learned from the texts. With my wife being the initiator. My wife was planning on flying to visit her the end of May to consummate the affair and presumedly file for divorce shortly there after.

But I found the texts first, I had known things were bad… and had actively started trying to address issues. I spent the last  two months picking up the chores around the house and then some, doing my best to express my admiration for her, and appreciation of her and to make her comfortable, give her space but also making more nuanced emotional bids, when she was playing the game, I bought a bigger new TV so we could play multiplayer together. Started watching shows together,  I tried to initiate intimacy even though I didn’t think I would be any good. But mostly got rebuffed. I told myself I had time to turn things around.

 

I started putting in efforts to clean myself up more, exercising, and taking better care of the house. But my efforts to spend more time together seemed rebuffed. Every time I came up with a solution to meet her specific needs It got…. Harder.

I wanted to spend more time talking, she doesn’t like small talk. I bought flash cards to create new dialogue options, now it felt forced.  Bought a Switch so we could play more two player games. Taking valuable time away from drawing / commissions time. Bought a bean bag chair so she could sit in the office with me while I worked on my book. And she could draw. It didn’t arrive in time. Took her on more dates,  she either wasn’t feeling well, or went on the date but didn’t really talk. Cuddles were few and far between and more often then not if I entered the room while she was talking to her discord friends I would get the cold shoulder.

 

There were flashes of bright moments here and there, then she would go cold again. At the time I didn’t understand now I realize she had already ended the marriage in her heart.

 

Anyways on April 17th I finally caught on. And that was the end of it. She left and moved in with her mum.  I am presuming she will continue the relationship with the affair partner. The texts went back FAR Even as far back as the end of March (My f…ing birthday) they had been planning this. And now I am alone.

 

I’ve tried to be productive, started going back to church, started trying to see friends more, redoubled by exercise habits, trying to fix my diet. As noted, I bought a couple of books on relationship theory and self-help anxiety guides and I’ve listened to more podcasts in the last two weeks then I Have in the last 20 years.

I alternate between hopelessness and depression to anger and jealousy. The affair partner has an online side hustle on twitch, and I found them…. And there’s my wife in the comments cheering her on.

Divorce has been filed, doing it mutually. And a separation agreement is being drawn up. Meanwhile my friends and I packed up all her stuff last week and it’s been sitting in the garage. My house feels empty despite the two cats that she left to me without even moments pause. (Like not even a second glance at them as she left. She was the one who wanted them!!)

 

I am going to therapy, starting next week. Took me some time to find one that my benefits would cover and was close enough to not be unreasonable.

 

My friends have been good, and so have my family. But aside from a few moments of comfort, I am so terribly alone. I know that its unhealthy, I made her the center of my whole world, not realizing that was crushing her.  And now the center is gone, and I am adrift.

I know what I SHOULD be doing, but don’t know how to get there. I know what I SHOULD have done but cannot go back.  Anyways I know its technically not an off my chest. But I haven’t been able to share all the exact details with my friends or family. Again out of shame, embarrassment and fatigue of being told “you were so good to her, its not your fault, or get over it”

 

 

 

TL:DR  - My wife left me for her affair partner after a slow death.

1ke8ozw,https://www.reddit.com/r/bourbon/comments/1ke8ozw/bardstownlouisville_trip_review/,Bardstown/Louisville Trip Review,"My wife and I went on a trip through Bardstown, hitting a lot of the distilleries in the area. We had a great time and I thought I'd lay out what we did in case anyone is looking at something similar. I used some info from this sub for the trip planning, so I wanted to give some info back where I could!

I'm breaking all this info down into 3 sections, First will be notes on our tours and tastings, then notes on some restaurants and other things we did, then the list of what we bought on/because of the trip. Sorry for the length\*! I'm happy to answer questions if anyone has them!

# TOURS/TASTINGS

*Prohibition Craft Spirits-Louisville-*This is the home of NULU whiskies, mostly (if not all) MGP distillate that they're finishing. We did a tour that happened to be a private one for us. Started with a cocktail at the bar (not included, but delicious), then we got some general prohibition history as well as the history of the company. They had a very colorful character running their business side in the past and that story was fascinating. Our tour guide, Willow, was fantastic. We tasted 5 whiskies, their Reserve bourbon, their Toasted bourbon, a French Oak Stave finished bourbon, the Hazelbaker BiB Indiana bourbon, and a barrel proof Rye. All of them were tasty, my wife liked the Toasted the most, I liked the Rye the most. We'd recommend this tour.

*Jim Beam-Maturation Matters*\-Another accidental private tour for us! This was a lot of fun, we went into one of the rickhouses to thieve whiskey from 3 barrels from the 1st, 3rd, and 9th floors that were all about the same age. We got to knock the bungs out of the barrels ourselves (normally only two people would get to, but there were only two of us!), and thieve our own whiskey which was very cool. We loved seeing how the different areas of the rickhouse made such a difference in the product. The tour ended with a sample of Jim Beam Barrel Proof, which wasn't half bad. Another fantastic tour guide, one of the front desk workers did get genuinely excited for us when we said which experience we were there for. We may go back to this one if we're in the area again.

*Heaven Hill-Grain to Glass Tasting-*This was a more crowded experience than our first two, although the whiskey was still tasty. We had the Heaven Hill BiB, then the Grain to Glass Bourbon, Wheated Bourbon, and Rye, as a HH staff member took us through a little bit of the company history and the Grain-to-Glass line itself. I liked the Rye the best, it had what I can only describe as a crystalline spearmint finish which was so fun. The other two in the GtG line were nice, but paled a little in comparison. We'd recommend this tasting, and the Rye!

*Limestone Branch*\-*The Yellowstone Select Experience*\-We arrived early, met Corky, our first distillery cat of the trip, and had a drink at the bar. We loved the cocktails and it wasn't a bad place to hang out for an hour. The tour was pretty boilerplate, We saw the facility, which looked like a distillery, and they had us taste the fermenting mash. We did get to thieve from a barrel in their ""rickhouse"" which is a shipping container they had out back. It wasn't as impressive as what we had at Beam earlier the same day. The flight we had was fine but not striking. We tasted a standard bourbon, a select bourbon, a single barrel bourbon, and a single malt. There was one more but I didn't note it and I'm not sure what it was. We'd stop back at the bar if we were in the area, but wouldn't tour again.

*Four Roses-Single Barrel tasting*\-*Cox's Creek-*Another incidental private tasting! We had the new Red label as well as two Single Barrel Barrel Strength expressions. I tragically forgot to note the recipes. They were very good, our guide was great. We'd absolutely redo this one if only because they swap out the whiskies all the time. 

*Lux Row-Grain to Barrel Tour*\-This was not our favorite. It started with a long, dull, video that felt more like a shareholder presentation than an intro to people talking about something they care about. It was almost the same script as the Yellowstone tour (not a huge shock as they're both MGP brands). Our tour guide was absolutely lovely, but it's a pretty basic tour. We had another thieving from a barrel in the rickhouse, which was nice, but not stellar. We tasted a Single barrel Rebel picked by Kyle Busch, Old Ezra Barrel strength (it was better with some water), Lux row 4 grain, Lux row Double Single barrel, and my wife and I got the bonus pour which was Rebel 10 year. We didn't really like any of the whiskies. 

*Preservation Distillery-Tour + Tasting*\-I'll admit, this one played directly into my taste, but they did it well. We started with a tasting, had Wattie Boone American whisky and Bourbon, Cock of the Walk, Preservation Bourbon, Old Man Winter, and Very Old St Nick Winter Maple. I'm a sucker for oddball liquor of any type and loved the bigger swings here. The tour was nice, it's a gorgeous facility, the staff was relaxed and friendly. I'm excited to see what comes out as they keep moving into more of their own distilling. I had a pour of a Rare Perfection at their bar afterward, then went out and watched the longhorn cows for a while. 

*Bardstown Bourbon Company-Barrel Thieving Experience*\-We had a great time, tasted their Wheated bourbon, high rye bourbon, and straight rye from the barrel at cask strength. Our tour guide was great, had a lot to say, kept a straight face when I said that my nosing note for the Wheated bourbon was Lemonheads (which I do stand by). After all of those we tasted the West Virginia Barrel Company finished Rye. The Zebra Barrels (mixed cherry and oak) were neat to see. We finished this one with a barrel aged old fashioned at the bar. It was a little sweeter than I like. The tour was a great experience.

*Log Still Distillery*\-*Tour and Tasting*\-This is a trickier one. Log Still has decided to go right-wing politics forward. On Presidents' day this year they publicly released ""America's 47"" a whiskey they originally bottled for the Trump inauguration. That's not something that my wife and I are interested in supporting. We kept the tour anyway since we had already paid for it and tour guides are rarely very interlinked with ownership. Sadly, our tour guide really lived that part of the brand. He told us a number of times about how consumer protections were all fake. One of those times he was talking about the Bottled-in-Bond Act of 1897. He was also the worst of the guides we had at giving the tour, a lot of very loud laughing at his own jokes before my wife and I had even cracked a smile (regrettably this was another accidentally private tour). The tasting was forgettable, basic gin, barrel aged gin, Monks Road bourbon, Rattle and Snap Tennessee whiskey yellow label. None were standouts, none were terrible. The grounds were very pretty.

*Makers Mark Tour*\-I just kept talking about how it felt like Whiskey Disneyworld. That's not a knock, it's just a very polished face that they're presenting. The art around was fun and often quite pretty, the campus is gorgeous. Our tour guide was great, loved hearing the history, and seeing everything around. Tasting was Standard Makers, Makers 46, Makers Cask Strength, and a Single Barrel called Panna Cotta. You've likely had most of those, but the Single Barrel was very tasty, and had some Panna Cotta-esque notes!

*Kentucky Peerless-Louisville-*Lovely little highly passionate distillery. Neat to see how they've fit an entire operation (with an offsite rickhouse for the first 3 years of aging according to our guide) into a pretty small place on Whiskey Row. It was a fun story to hear and the tasting was excellent. We had a High Rye Bourbon, the Small Batch Straight Rye, a Single Barrel Bourbon called Lemon Bundt Cake and a single barrel rye named French Vanilla Waffle Cone. Both of those tasted pretty close to their names.

# Restaurants/Other

*Graveley Brewing-Louisville-*Great vibes, the beer we had was quite good, I didn't note the names because we got a little rushed through. We like to pass through Louisville somewhat often and we'll definitely be back.

*5 Brothers Bar and Kitchen-Heaven Hill*\-Tasty, lighter than we expected which was good for a day of many many whiskey tastings. I had the chicken cutlet sandwich, my wife had a strawberry salad with added grilled chicken. Both were good. My wife had a seasonal cocktail with bourbon, lychee, prosecco, edible flowers and a few other things. I had a flight, HH BiB, Elijah Craig BP, Larceny Barrel Strength, EC barrel select. I loved the Barrel select, as you'll see down below I couldn't get any the day we were there. The bar staff was also really impressive, we watched them handle a massive line and two separate rushes within an hour without breaking a sweat. 

*The Bar At Willett-*We couldn't fit a Willett tour in, so we went to the bar. We got to sit out on the porch on a rainy afternoon looking out over some of the outbuildings and the fields. It was gorgeous, as many people have said before me, the food is excellent. We had the trout dip and the brussels sprouts. My wife had a pour of a Lagunitas Stout finished single barrel, I had a flight of Pot Still, rowan's Creek, and Noah's Mill. I know those are polarizing, but as a sworn lover of weird liquor, I was fascinated by the lemon notes and enjoyed the whiskies. At some point it's nice to have something different. Whenever we're in the area we'll be back.

*Circa 1856-Chicken Cock-*We stopped in to the tasting room and had a flight each. We tried their basic line (Bourbon, Rye, Small Batch Bourbon, Double Oaked), and their Limited Edition flight (Cotton Club Rye, Mizurana Finished, Red Stave Syrah barrel finished, and Chanticleer Cognac barrel finished). They were all nice. We had picked up a bottle of the basic bourbon for a weekend away with friends earlier in the year and the rest of the line stood up. I especially loved the Chanticleer, which was just deeply luxurious, and the Cotton Club Rye which had a fascinating umami note.

*Scout and Scholar Brewing*\-Great microbrewery in Bardstown. The food is good, the beer is good. We went twice!

*The Kitchen Table-Beam-*We had a great lunch here. We had the duck poppers, a wild mushroom pizza (made with the same yeast as the whiskey) and the fried catfish. It was all quite good. The pizza had a sourdough flavor to its crust that was a nice contrast to the rich toppings. My wife had a phenomenal strawberry basil cocktail, I had a flight of Hardin's creek Golden Origins, a Booker's (didn't note the batch), and Little Book ""The Infinite"" as well as a pour of Clermont Steep. We liked all the whiskies, obviously the Clermont steep wasn't playing in the same league as the others. The Booker's was our favorite. 

*Bardstown Bourbon Company Bar-*We stopped in to taste the actual products since our tour didn't really have that. We had their origins series flight, all were nice, and their Collaboration flight with the Amrut, SilverOak, and Goose Island expressions. The bar is a gorgeous place to hang out for a while, if we make it back we'll try to eat a meal there. 

*Makers Mark Bar*\-The restaurant at Makers is currently closed for renovations, but they have some food up at their bar in the check-in building. For basically catering food it was quite good, and it was nice to sit on the back porch overlooking the distillery and watching the sheep. We split a cocktail and a flight, all were nice. The whiskies in the flight were two single barrels that were only available there and the 2025 ""The Keepers"" edition. 

*The Garage Cafe*\-A little mini coffee roastery in Bardstown. It's not in the main strip so its easy to miss but the coffee is good, the food's decent and the prices are great. Would heartily recommend. 

*Mammy's*\-We only went to the sports bar, the restaurant side was closed. I'm not sure what was going on. we waited for about 40 minutes for two small sliders each. They weren't cheap either. The staff was clearly swamped, but there were more failures than that when we were there. 

*Bardstown Motor Lodge*\-This is the renovated motel where we stayed. We liked it a lot! The renovation is quite recent, so keep an eye on recent reviews in case they skimped and things start to break down, but if you're going in the next year we'd absolutely recommend it. They had a nice little bar in the courtyard with a decently stocked selection. The staff was friendly and very knowledgable about the area.

# What we Bought

Most of these were purchased at the distillery, a few I bought later because they were significantly cheaper at home.

* Nulu Toasted Bourbon-one of my Wife's favorites
* Bookers-Master Distiller's Batch 2024-03
* Bernheim-200ml tube-it was cheap and I hadn't had it
* Heaven Hill Grain to Glass Rye
* Noah's Mill
* Old Bardstown Bottled in Bond-the hotel bartender recommended this as a cheap but offbeat selection we could only get in KY.
* Chicken Cock Double Oaked
* Four Roses Barrel Strength Single barrel OBSK
* Four Roses Small Batch Select 50ml-I wanted to taste it and hadn't
* Wattie Boone American Whiskey
* Old Man Winter
* Bardstown Bourbon Company-Goose Island collaboration
* Maker's 46 Cask Strength
* Peerless Single Barrel Rye ""French Vanilla Waffle Cone""
* Peerless small batch bourbon 200ml

1ke8ntm,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ke8ntm/i_need_advice/,I need advice,"How can I stop thinking about my weight everyday? All the questions/statements frequently flowing through my head include:

Do they think I’m fat?

Do they think “of course she’s eating(that)” whenever I eat, especially anything deemed unhealthy?

How do they see me?

Am I fat?

Do they think less of me because i’m bigger?

I don’t even think i’m that big (≈127 lbs and 5’2”.. My weight mainly goes to my short legs, tummy, and upper arms)

I look thin in the morning!

I ate too much after school and then have to eat dinner??? Uh oh

My fingers look so fat and sausagey.

I wish i didn’t compare myself to her so much.

Will this iced coffee put me over my calorie limit?

Will I ever be thin/see myself as thin?

Try to eat as daintily as possible and refuse all snacks/food offered to me to look like I’m healthy.

She’s close to my weight/midsize/a little heavier than me and she’s super pretty and funny and kinda and still getting love and praise, so I must be seen that way too, right? I’ve gotta be!

Do they see me run out of breath walking up the stairs and think I’m fat? (all thin people I know lose their breath too so)

How come she can eat so much and not gain a pound, but the second I do the same I feel grossly obese.

* Whenever it’s summertime and don’t have school to take me away from my habits, I’ll constantly do body checks and if it looks good I’ll hold back on eating until absolutely hungry. *

Feeling shame for eating.

Feeling disgusting in tighter tops.

Always doing the shirt pull and sucking in my tummy.

Constantly checking the mirror to make sure I don’t look too fat in an outfit and that maybe my face and makeup and hair will make up for it.

Seeing my thighs spread out when I sit, the front of my thighs sticking out so far, and my wide calves.



The worst thing for me is the guilt surrounding food and asking myself if people care that I’m eating or if they even think I’m fat. And if so, do they even care? These thoughts plague my mind everyday and I can’t live my life normally without questioning if people think I’m fat and out of shape…But the thing is, I’m not unhealthy, I just have some more chub than others. 

I can still cross my legs (more on my knee and sliding but whatever) and whatnot. I know I might be a little on the chubbier side, but idk how much or if I’m even valid in my thoughts. I think if i were taller this wouldn’t be an issue. I swear my short legs and such make me look fatter. 

Idk what to do. I wish I could make these thoughts go away and decide to just live my life and make healthy decisions (like trying to move everyday in some way, eating my protein and fruits and veggies, and drinking water) while also having fun (sweet treats, eating out, etc) and have weight loss be a result of that. Yes, I want to lose weight, but I want it to not control my whole day.

I hate whenever my dad has to get a coffee because he slurps it out the cup so the 4 hours there I was dying from my biggest trigger. Had to put earbuds in and tried my loops which suck because I can still somewhat hear. I also have a visual trigger so anytime he would raise the cup I immediately felt uneasy and wanted to jump out the window. Other than that it was fine until be we’re heading home he wanted another coffee I said absolutely not. Well he got one so another 4 hours of dealing with uncomfortable earbuds in and staring out the window because my mom wants to trigger me with brushing her hair with her hand and scratching her scalp every 5 minutes and my dad talking with his hands by swinging them everywhere and slurping the cup to the brink of death. I just wanted to go home so bad to lock myself in my room and he said we were gonna take another pitstop for no reason and I said please no. He said “stop acting like a 2 year old.” And that’s what pissed me off so much today because they have been triggering me all day I’ve had no time to decompress and get away from them and I’m trying everything in my rightful mind to not go ballistic and not rip my hair out and he wants to tell me to not act like a 2 year old like I wish I was was deaf so bad I don’t think I would miss any sound in the world because I’m constantly on edge. I hate my dad so much because he’s the one that made my misophonia so bad because he thought I was too sensitive as a kid and needed to coop with the sounds so he would purposely smack and slurp right in my ear or around me so I could “coop better” I used to scratch the skin off my arm to the point I was bleeding and had scars because I wasn’t ever allowed to eat in my room.

1ke8lby,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1ke8lby/theres_a_woman_who_lives_inside_the_walls_of_my/,"There's a woman who lives inside the walls of my gallery. For fifteen years, she's been knocking against the marble, attempting to deliver a message I couldn't decipher - until last night. Now, I understand.","
I’ve always felt profoundly relieved to put that burning city behind me. Move past the death and destruction. Divide myself from the ash and the ruins, the rust-colored clouds and the blood-orange sky. Out of sight, out of mind.

Towering steel doors swung shut as I stepped into the gallery.

I sighed, allowing my shoulders to sag as I slowly twisted my neck. Left to right, right to left. The A/C hummed, and its crisp, mechanical breath crawled over my exposed skin. My body cooled. The muscles in my neck began to unwind.

This was my sanctuary. The last building standing. A great marble raft drifting above an ocean of rubble.

I couldn’t let myself completely relax, though.

Yes, the gallery was safer than the inferno outside its walls. Much safer. But it came with its own risks.

Because it wasn’t just *my* sanctuary: I shared the refuge with one other person. Unlike me, she never seemed to leave. She usually wasn’t visible when I entered, but she was always there.

If I couldn’t see her, that meant she was in the walls. If she was in the walls, she'd be knocking her forehead against the marble. She didn’t have any knuckles, so the woman made her skull an instrument.

Same pattern every time, measured and deliberate.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

The knocks were gentle, but the sound carried generously through the cavernous studio floor. It was a single box-shaped room with thirty-foot tall ceilings and not a lot in between. Each wall held a few paintings from artists of no renown. There was a spiral staircase in the center, but the sixty-eight metal steps led to nowhere, abruptly stopping two-thirds of the way up.

And most cryptically, there was the elevator. Directly across from the entrance. No buttons to call the damn thing. The outline of a down arrow above the doors I’d never seen flash. No one ever came out, and I knew no one ever would, either.

The elevator was a one-way trip, constructed for me alone. Wasn’t ever sure how I knew that, but I’d bet my life on its truth twenty times over.

So, there I’d be: by myself on the gallery floor, that snake of a woman slithering through its walls, surrounded by an empty, burning city for miles in every direction. It would always start with me approaching the massive steel doors, waves of heat galloping over my back, but when it would end was variable. It could take minutes, it could take hours. On rare occasions, it could take days or weeks.

Eventually, though, I’d wake up.

The same inscrutable dream, every night without fail, for over fifteen years. A transmission from the depths of a hollow reality that I never understood until last night.

***My Birth:***

Ever since I can remember, I’ve felt out of place. An outsider among my own species. I’m sure a lot of people experience a similar pariah-hood, and I obviously can’t confirm my lived experience is distinct or extraordinary in comparison.

Let me provide an example - some objective proof of my otherness.

As soon as I drew a first breath, my mother’s heart stopped. Spontaneous cardiac arrest, no rhyme or reason. An unceremonious end, like the death of an old car battery. The medical team leapt into action. A few does of IV adrenaline later, the muscle wearily returned to duty.

But the moment her heart restarted, mine then stopped. Then they’d resuscitate me, only to have my mother die again. So on and so on.

The way my dad used to tell it, the doctors became incrementally more unnerved and bewildered each time we flipped. Life was a zero-sum game in that operating room: it was me or her decreed God, or the reaper, or whatever unknowable divinity would be in charge of such a cosmic oddity. The uncanny tug-of-war would have probably been amusing to witness if the implications weren’t so deeply tragic.

Three or four cycles later, my mother’s heart gave out completely. Obstinately refused to beat, no matter what the medical team did. Dad would sometimes theorize that was an active decision made by the doctors that handled her care, even if they didn’t have “the balls” to admit it.

Like once they realized that one of us was dying, they arbitrarily awarded me with life. Started covertly injecting saline into my mother’s veins instead of adrenaline or something.

I doubt that last part actually happened. The circumstances were just viciously unfair, and that type of thing is fertile soil for growing conspiracy. Regardless, I felt his pain.

See, that’s the rub. Although I’ve always felt like an outsider, that doesn’t mean I’ve lacked empathy. I have reverence for the people around me. I’ve just never felt *connected* to any of them. I’m like a naturalist living alone in the jungle. I love the flora and the fauna. I respect the miracle that nature represents. But at the end of the day, I’m still alone.

Which brings me to Anthony.

\- - - - -

***My Childhood:***

I experienced a fair amount of bullying as a kid, probably became a target on account of my quiet nature and my social isolation. A lone gazelle straying too far from the safety of the herd. They didn’t much bother me, though. I just couldn’t see them as predators: more like flies buzzing around my head. Noisy and a smidge irritating, but ultimately harmless.

That was the problem - they *wanted* to feel like predators, and I wasn't providing the sensation. Inciting fear and misery made them feel in control. So, when they couldn’t get a rise out of me with their routine arsenal of schoolyard mockery, things escalated.

And every time a new prank was enacted - a carton of milk spilled over my head, a few spiders dumped into my backpack, etc. - I would notice Anthony watching from the sidelines, livid on my behalf. Tall for his age, frizzy black hair, blue eyes boiling over with anger behind a pair of thick square glasses.

One afternoon, Austin, a dumber and more violent breed of bully, became fed up with my relative disinterest. Decided to take the torment up a notch. He snuck up behind me while I was eating lunch, stuck a meaty fist into my bun, and yanked a thick chunk of hair from my scalp.

That was certainly my line in the sand. It was Anthony’s too, apparently.

I spun around. Before he could even gloat, I lunged forward, opened my jaw, and bit down hard on his nearest elbow. At the same time, Anthony had been running up behind him with a metal lunch tray arched over his shoulder. The shiny rectangle connected to Austin’s temple with a loud clatter, almost like the ringing of a gong.

It was a real “one-two” punch.

An hour later, Anthony and I had our first conversation outside the principal’s office, both waiting to be interrogated.

I’ve never been quite comfortable with the way he looked at me, even back then. His grin was too wide, his focus too intense. On the surface, it was an affectionate expression. But there was something dark looming behind it all: a possessiveness. A smoldering infatuation that bordered on obsession.

I tried to ignore it, because I genuinely did like him. As a friend. He was the only one I felt comfortable confiding in. The only person who knew of the gallery and the burning city, other than myself.

Now, there’s no one else.

This post is designed to fix that.

***The Gallery:***

“*Ide conquers the Tarandos”* was my favorite. (The first word is pronounced *e-day*, I think.)

It wasn’t the largest painting in the gallery, nor was it the most technically impressive. There was just something bewitching about the piece, though. I found myself hopelessly magnetized to it for hours every night.

One foot long, about half a foot tall, with a frame composed of small, alternating suns and moons carved into the wood. It depicted a single-armed Valkyrie, with white wings and dull gray armor, lying on her back under the shade of a willow tree. A creature with the body of a man and the head of a stag is descending on her. Its face is contorted into a vicious snarl, arms outstretched with violent intent. The beast seems unaware of the serrated dagger in the Valkyrie’s singular hand, tenting the skin on the right side of its neck, about to draw blood.

Oil paint lended the scene a striking vibrancy. The grass appeared lush, almost palpable. The hair on the beast’s knuckles looked matted and dense, like it was overflowing with grease.

Studying that canvas made me feel alive. More than I’ve ever felt in the waking world, honestly. However, that invigoration would fade into unease the moment my eyes landed on the two black holes above the Valkyrie’s head.

Because they weren't some bizarre artistic choice.

They were holes - literally.

Every painting in the gallery had a pair of them.

She liked to watch me look at the paintings every so often.

When she did, two bloodshot eyes would intensely monitor my gaze through the holes.

Sometimes, she'd watch for so long without blinking that tears would drip down the length of the piece.

Eventually, the frame would tremble with her message.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

***My Adolescence:***

*“What’s the holdup, then? Just do it already,”* seventeen-year-old me proclaimed, unafraid and defiant.

The man in the ski-mask tilted his head. His glare dissipated. I stepped closer. The employee behind the counter stopped pulling bills from the register, eyes wide with disbelief.

*“Quinn! What the fuck are you doing?”* Anthony hissed, cowering behind a nearby rack of chips.

I sniffed the air. Ran my fingers along the countertop while licking my lips. Surveyed my surroundings by turning my head and perked my ears for unusual sounds.

Smell, touch, taste, sight, hearing: I re-sampled them all. Everything was as it should be.

I felt my confidence balloon further.

*“I’ll do it, bitch…I’ll s-shoot. I ain’t afraid. I’ll s-splatter your guts across the fucking floor…”* the would-be criminal stuttered.

I stepped even closer. Close enough that the barrel of his pistol began digging into my chest.

*“Yeah, I heard you the first time, man.”*

I smiled, baring my teeth.

*“So, do it then. Look. I’m making it easy for you. Don’t even have to aim.”*

Like the flick of a switch, his demeanor changed. The gunman’s bravado collapsed in on itself, falling apart like paper mache in the rain.

Without saying another word, he sprinted from that CVS and disappeared into the night.

I flipped around so I could face Anthony, closed my eyes, and took an exaggerated bow. He wasn’t applauding. Neither was the flabbergasted kid behind the cash register, for that matter.

But I sure as shit pretended they were.

I was damn proud of my little parlor trick. Later that night, though, I’d ruin the magic. Anthony was insistent. Just wouldn’t let it go.

He wore me down.

So, I told him that didn’t experience any synesthesia. That meant we were safe. No one in that convenience store was going to die. My performance was just a logical extrapolation of that arcane knowledge.

No one was going to die relatively soon, anyway.

\- - - - -

My first dream of the burning city and the gallery came the night of my eleventh birthday. My ability to sense approaching death came soon after.

Synesthesia, for those of you unaware, is a neurological condition where the stimulation of one sense becomes involuntarily translated into the language of another sense.

But that probably sounds like a bunch of medical blather, so let me provide you with a few examples:

*The man tasted loud.*

*The apple felt bright.*

*The musical note sounded purple.*

You get the idea. It’s like nerves getting their wires crossed.

For a whole year before his death, my grandfather looked salty. His apartment smelled quiet. His voice sounded circular. And all of those queer sensations only became more intense as his expiration date approached.

I eventually picked up on the pattern.

Once I grasped the bounds of my extrasensory insight, death lost its hold over me. You see, death draws a lot of its power from anticipation. People don’t like surprises, especially shitty ones. Nobody wants to be startled by the proverbial monster under the bed. I, however, had become liberated.

I could feel death’s advance from miles away, therefore, I had nothing to fear. Nothing at all.

At least, that’s what I *used* to believe when I was young and dumb. Unfortunately, there are two major flaws in my supposed invulnerability that I completely swept under the rug. You may shouting them at your computer screen already.

1. Just because I could sense death didn’t mean I was shielded from the tragedies of life.
2. I didn’t know for certain that I could sense *everyone’s* death. There’s one person in particular who would be unverifiable by definition.

How could I be sure that I was capable of sensing my own death coming, if I had never died before?

\- - - - -

***The Gallery:***

The night of my twelfth birthday, she revealed herself.

She finally came out.

There was a crack aside the elevator, no larger than the size of a volleyball. It was impossible to see what laid beyond that crack. Its darkness was impenetrable.

The woman wriggled out of that darkness and slithered towards me.

She had somehow been reduced to just a head with a spinal cord lagging behind it, acting as her tail.

Her movements were distinctly reptilian, rows of vertebrae swinging side to side, creating U-shaped waves of rattling bones as she glided across the marble floor.

I couldn’t see her face until she was only a few feet away. Long, unkempt strands of gray hair obscured her features, wreathing them behind a layer of silver filaments like the blinds on a window.

There was a crater at the center of her forehead. A quarter-sized circle of her skull had been completely pulverized from the incessant knocking.

She twirled around my leg, spiraling up my torso until she was high enough to drape her spinal cord over my shoulders.

Then, we were face to face, and she spoke the only eight words I’ve ever heard spill from her withered lips until last night.

*""Are*

*You Ready*

*To See What Is*

*Below?""*

I shook my head. She looked disappointed.

Then, I woke up.

Three hundred and sixty-five days later, she’d wriggle out from the crack again to ask me the same question.

Year, after year, after year.

In order for you to understand what transpired over the last twenty-four hours, I need to explain me and Anthony’s falling out.

The summer before I went away to college, he arrived at my doorstep and professed that he was in love with me. Had been for a long time, apparently.

His speech laid out all the gory details: how he believed we were soul mates, how perfect our children were going to be, how honored he was to get to die by my side.

Note the language. It wasn’t that he believed we *could* be soul mates, or that our children *could* be perfect. No, that phrasing was much too indefinite. From his perspective, our future was already sealed: written in the stars whether I liked it or not.

I tried to ease him back to reality gently. Reiterated the same talking points I’d harped on since he hit puberty.

Romantic love wasn’t in the cards for me. I was incapable of experiencing that level of connection with anyone. It had nothing to do with the value of him as a person or as a potential mate. My rejection wasn’t a judgement.

He wouldn’t hear it. Instead, he accused me of being a “stuck-up bitch” through bouts of rage-tinted sobs. I was going to college and he was staying in our hometown to take a job at his father’s factory. That must be it, he realized out loud. I didn't feel like he was good enough for me. He lacked prestige.

I think I responded to those accusations with something along the lines of:

*“Listen, Anthony, I don’t think I’m better than you. It’s not like that at all. We’re just different. Fundamentally different. I’m sorry, but that’s never going to change, either. Not for you and not for anyone else.”*

In retrospect, maybe I could have selected cleaner verbiage. In the heat of the moment, I don’t think he took the words as I intended.

From there, Anthony hurled a chair through my house’s living room window, stomped out the front door, and exited my life for a little over five years.

\- - - - -

***Current Day***

Fast forward to last week.

I returned to my hometown from my apartment in the city due to the death of my father, something I’d began feeling inklings of two years ahead of time. After the funeral, I’ve focused on getting his estate in order, only venturing down onto main street once in the seven days I’ve been here. The coffee machine broke, and I was in dire straits.

And who do I just so happen to run in to?

Anthony.

Honestly, I barely recognized him. He was no longer sporting a lanky frame, frizzy black hair, and thick bottlecap glasses. His body was muscular, almost Herculean. He slicked his hair back, varnishing it with some hideously pungent over-the-counter male beauty product. He no longer wore glasses now that he was able to afford a LASIK procedure - cured his shortsightedness for good.

I couldn’t detect the same darkness behind his eyes anymore, but that wasn’t because something purged it from his system.

He’d just gotten more proficient at hiding it.

\- - - - -

Last night, we went out for dinner and a drink. Platonically. I made that exceptionally transparent from the get-go. He teased me in response, inquiring whether my boyfriend in the city would come “kick the shit out of him” if he heard I was out with an “old flame”.

For what felt like the millionth time, I explained to Anthony that I wasn’t interested in that type of connection. Thus, I was single.

That made him smile.

Inevitably, he invited me back to his apartment. He was very proud of his lucrative new position in his company and the luxuries that came with it, and he wanted to show off.

I almost reminded him that it wasn’t *his* company. It was his father’s company. To avoid conflict, I held my tongue.

It might sound insane that I agreed to his invitation. Like I said, he concealed his darkness well. Anthony may have grown up to be a bit of a tool, but he was still the only person I ever felt close with. I was genuinely interested in seeing how his life had turned out.

I wasn’t experiencing *any* synesthesia around him, either. To me, that indicated relative safety: no one was going to die. If he tried something lecherous, an act of depravity that may not necessarily inflict death, well, that’s what pepper spray is for.

Anthony lived in a two-story brick row home on the outskirts of town. I walked in the door and was greeted by a tiny entrance nook followed by an extensive set of stairs, which led up to his ostentatious foyer-slash-entertainment room.

I won’t lie - it was impressive. That was the point, I think. His home was just a big, glossy distraction: something to keep your attention away from the bedeviled man who lurked within. Barely even noticed him tapping on some home security dashboard to the right of the front door.

I do remember hearing the heavy click of a motorized lock, though.

At that point, I was already walking up the stairs.

\- - - - -

For the next hour, we sat across from each on a massive leather sectional in his foyer, chitchatting over an additional glass of wine.

Eventually, though, enough was enough.

I think he sensed I was preparing to excuse myself and go home, because he leaned over, grabbed one of five stout candles off of the coffee table, and began lighting the wick with a box of matches he pulled from his blazer pocket.

I told Anthony it was getting late, and that it was time for me to leave. He didn’t say anything. He didn’t react to the sentence at all. He just kept silently lighting the candles.

When I witnessed the reflection of the burning wick in his eyes, I realized I had made a mistake.

*Fine,* I thought. *I don’t need his permission to leave.*

He didn’t say anything as I darted past him, jogging down the stairs. I pulled the knob to the front door.

It didn’t budge. There wasn't any obvious way to unlock it, either.

*“…Anthony? Can you kindly help me unlock the front door?”* I called up, experiencing terror for the first time in years: a voracious chill eating its way through my chest

Nothing. No response. Not a peep.

Instead, the lights clicked off.

I felt a lump grow in the back of my throat.

Sweat poured over my temples.

I perked my ears. No footfalls. No sound.

No synesthesias.

Just darkness oozing down that silent corridor: a lurching tidal wave of black tar moments away from swallowing me whole.

I reached into my purse for my cellphone.

Then - furious movement down the stairs.

The sound of heavy boots stomping on hardwood filled my ears. Before I could react, he was looming over me. An open hand exploded out from the shadows and hooked onto my blouse collar. With one forceful pull, he yanked me to the ground. The bridge of my nose crashed into the edge of a stair as I fell. Electric pain writhed and crackled over my sinuses. My mouth felt hot and boggy as he lugged back up to the foyer.

Anthony quickly pinned me to the floor in front of the coffee table. I thrashed and struggled, but it wasn’t much use. He had positioned one muscular knee on each of my elbows. I was trapped.

Without uttering a word, he wrapped his meaty claws around my neck and squeezed.

The veins in his head pulsed, his face swollen with fury. I started to see double.

Consciousness liquefied and slipped through my fingertips.

I closed my eyes.

With the last few grains of life I had left, I thought of my favorite painting.

“*Ide conquers the Tarandos”*

I wanted to die with its beauty graffiti'd on the inside my skull.

Unexpectedly, there was the tearing of flesh and a soggy gurgle, followed by a few sputtering coughs.

Anthony’s hands released. Oxygen rushed into my starved lungs.

I opened my eyes.

A serrated dagger had been plunged into the soft flesh of his neck, skewering it completely. I saw a bit of the blade poking through on the other side. Dewdrops of blood and plasma seeped from the fatal wound, trickling over his collarbone and dripping onto my blouse. The scent of iron quickly coated the interior of my broken nose.

A hand still tightly gripped the dagger’s handle, but Anthony’s heavy knees had never left my elbows.

It wasn’t mine, but it came from me. I traced the ethereal limb from the knife to the center of my ribcage, where it had sprouted.

And it as swiftly as it appeared, the limb and dagger vanished. Before Anthony collapsed on top of me, I used my freed hands to push him off and to the side. He fell, hitting the coffee table as he tumbled. The resulting collision sent five burning candles crashing onto a large cotton blanket nearby.

His foyer became a bonfire.

I stood up, still weak and woozy from the prolonged suffocation. The sofa had caught flame too. Harsh black smoke began to diffuse throughout the apartment.

I raced down the stairs once again, but I reached a similar impasse.

The door remained mechanically locked.

I screamed. Cried out for someone to hear me. Twisted the knob so hard that it tore the skin on my right palm. All the while, a conflagration bloomed behind me.

I shifted my attention to the digital security dashboard aside the door. I pushed my fingers against the keyboard. The device whirred to life.

Four asterisks stood in my way. A PIN number was required to get to the home screen.

I tried my birthday, two digits for the month, two digits for the year.

Incorrect. A warning on the screen read *two attempts left*

I tried Anthony’s birthday.

Nothing.

*One attempt left.*

My panic intensified, reaching a fever pitch in tandem with the ravenous flames one floor above.

Then, I heard it. At least, I think I heard it. Maybe my mind just clicked into place, and the realization was so profound that it felt like the noise began physically swirling around me.

Yet, I distinctly remember hearing the knocking from within the wall behind me.

*Tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap tap tap, pause.*

*Tap tap.*

I held my breath.

*1-3-4-2.*

The screen opened.

I clicked *UNLOCK*, twisted the knob, pushed my body against the door, and spilled out onto the street.

\- - - -

***The Gallery:***

When I arrived last night, a few hours after Anthony died, something was different.

The woman slithered out from the crack and started moving towards me. I met her halfway, next to the spiral stairs.

She grinned at me from the floor.

For the first time, I asked *her* a question.

*“Why could I not sense that Anthony was going to die?”*

She glided up my leg, draping her spine over my shoulders so she could be eye-to-eye with me. When she spoke, her sentences lacked the *1-3-4-2* rhythmic structure I'd come to know her by.

Her voice was high-pitched and raspy, and her mouth didn't actually move when she talked - she just kept it ajar and the words flowed out.

*“Because he was never supposed to die last night.* ***You*** *were supposed to die last night. That’s what was written. You can’t foretell something that’s never been written.”*

Her grin became sharper at the corners of her mouth, rapturous and grim.

*“But I intervened. You’d never get to the gallery unless I did something about it. Took a lot of work and planning, but I did it.* ***We*** *did it.”*

Then it was her turn to ask me something.

*“Are you ready to see what’s below?”*

I nodded.

Immediately, the down arrow above the elevator lit up bright red, and a chiming sound echo’d through the gallery.

The doors opened, and I gasped.

There was the headless body of a woman standing motionless inside the elevator, wearing a flowing silver dress. She held a balloon in her hand. The side of it read *“Happy Birthday!”* in a rainbow of colors.

The woman's head and her spine slithered ahead of me. It scaled the decapitated body and inserted its tail into the dry flesh between the body's collar bones until the head was snuggly attached.

I walked over and stepped in. The inside glistened, polished and reflective like a mirror. For the first time, I saw myself as I was within the gallery.

I’d always assumed I was the same age in the waking world that I was in the dreams. But I wasn’t. I was much, much older.

And that revelation really got me thinking.

Maybe the gallery has never been a dream. Maybe it’s been more of a premonition.

A vision of the future. The sight of a colossal, marble coffin towering above the ruins of an ever-burning city. An altar to the new gods of a new age.

The woman’s newly fastened head turned to me and whispered,

*“If you wake up before we get there, that’s OK. You’re finally safe. We can try again every night without fear. Eventually, with enough practice, you’ll make it over the apotheotic threshold. We can bring this all to fruition, my love, my one-armed Valkyrie, my deep red moon.*”

*“My one and only daughter.”*

Then, I woke up.",4,1746322792.0,scarystories,0,0.84,False

""Right, Dallas,"" he muttered to himself, the heat already thick in the air. He wasn't just going on holiday; this was a proper adventure. A visit to see his mate, Bo, whom he'd met backpacking through Southeast Asia years ago.

He drove to the Townsville Airport, the familiar landscape blurring past. Parking the ute, he grabbed his worn backpack, a faithful companion on countless journeys. Inside the terminal, the cool air was a welcome relief. He approached the Quantas counter, checked in for his two flights, and collected his boarding passes. Townsville to Brisbane, then Brisbane to Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) on American Airlines. A long haul, but the thought of catching up with Bo spurred him on.

The first leg was short and uneventful. Brisbane Airport was a hive of activity, a veritable metropolis compared to Townsville. Pierre found his gate, grabbed a coffee, and settled in for the wait. Finally, the call came, and he joined the queue to board the massive American Airlines plane.

The flight was a blur of movies, naps, and lukewarm airplane food. When the cabin lights finally came on, signaling their imminent arrival, Pierre felt a surge of excitement, mixed with a healthy dose of jetlag.

DFW Airport was enormous, a sprawling testament to American ambition. He followed the signs to Immigration and Customs, the process surprisingly smooth. And there he was – Bo, grinning from ear to ear, a ""Howdy, Mate!"" bursting from his lips.

“Strewth, Bo! Good to see you, cobber,” Pierre replied, slapping him on the back.

Bo steered him away from the taxi ranks. “Forget that nonsense. I told you, we’re taking DART. This mate of mine ain’t about to pay those airport toll fees.”

They hopped on the train, the landscape changing from airport sprawl to Texan suburbia. They disembarked at Hidden Ridge Station, where Bo's beat-up pickup truck was waiting.

The next few days were a whirlwind of Texan hospitality. Bo introduced Pierre to his friends: Jane, a vibrant artist; Shelley, a quiet bookworm; and Ella, a bubbly redhead with a wicked sense of humor. They barbecued, went to a rodeo, and even attempted line dancing, much to Pierre's amusement.

One evening, they were all sitting on Bo's porch, sipping iced tea. Jane was regaling them with stories about her family. “My Godmother absolutely loves Dallas, she says it’s the only place she feels truly at home.”

Then, she frowned. “I just can’t stand El Paso, though. My asthma flares up so badly there. My lungs and throat burn, it’s awful.” She shivered, then sneezed violently. ""Excuse me!""

Pierre scratched his head, a familiar habit when he was trying to process something. It was all a bit overwhelming, the change of scenery, the new faces, the sheer scale of everything.

Despite the jetlag and the unfamiliar surroundings, Pierre was having a blast. He was halfway across the world, experiencing a culture so different from his own. He was embracing the adventure, the laughter, and the unexpected connections.

The ebook on Bo's shelf, a battered copy of an Agnes Scott College student newspaper from 1940-41, sat collecting dust. Neither of them paid it any attention, just as they didn't dwell on the romantic odes of Keats or the Eloi of H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine,"" though Shelley might have enjoyed the former. The conversation flowed, touching on everything and nothing, a mix of serious discussions and silly jokes. At one point, Bo declared, ""Work is such a turkey and a bacon!"" which caused Ella to erupt in laughter.

Pierre knew this trip was something special. He felt a sense of freedom, a break from the routines of home. He saw similarities even among all the differences. He realized that people, no matter where they were from, all wanted the same things: friendship, laughter, and a sense of belonging. And right now, sitting on Bo's porch, surrounded by new friends, Pierre felt like he belonged.",0,1746322708.0,stories,0,0.5,False

I work in a medical building which has an interesting layout. I sit at central registration and check-in for all the clinics in the building and there's a ton of foot traffic (250-320 patients a day). We also share the building with a gym (around 300+ gym-goers a day). There is no public coffee in our building and I feel that it would be a huge hit for the employees, patients, and gym-goers. Patients are always asking where they can get coffee. I really want to jump on this opportunity and I have multiple years of barista experience. I've been doing a lot of research and am still planning things out but I've given my business plan to my supervisor and her boss as well and they both like the idea. The next person to approach would be the property manager.

My predicament is that my partner and I are also in the midst of partitioning his parent's property in order to build a house for us. I still don't know at what point we'll be applying for the construction loan since this has been a lengthy process to just split the land, but I know if I quit my full time job, that brings our income down to just one steady income from my partner.

We don't have any kids yet, and since we don't have a mortgage we're paying for since we've been living with his parents while until we build the house, there is a lower risk to it. But I don't want this to now jeopardize everything with our house. We've been working with the county and different contractors for over a year now.

Should I follow my gut and proceed with the coffee cart? We could also potentially have my in-laws co-sign for the construction loan. Or should I wait on the coffee cart until we've secured a loan with both my current income and my partners?

Another option I'm considering is continuing to work my current job, but work on the cart on the side and start out at a farmer's market that has just started in an up and coming neighborhood/town area that's growing very fast.

My baby the last month or so only took about 2 bottles a day because he’s a great food eater and was starting not to like it anymore. He’s one now and completely refuses it. I have 11 cans left, that expire between Feb-July of next year. I’d love to give to a parent in need, I struggled getting it and finding it before my insurance approved us.

Good chemistry, compatible humor, he's an animal lover (<3), and I'm starting to get those butterflies in my stomach again! Haven't felt them in years!

Anyway, he eventually invites me out to dinner at a pretty fancy local restaurant.

So, got dolled up, little black dress, hoping this can go somewhere.

Dinner is amazing, though I did feel a little guilty ordering my fourth kumis, he swore up and down it was fine.

This is good, I'm feeling good (probably thanks to all the kumis, lol), so I invite him back to my place to watch some of my favorite show (VHS recordings of the Polish dub of Nightcourt) but we weren't going to be watching any TV. 🤭

We're back on the couch, W tym odcinku Dan Fielding trafia do szpitala z powodu konieczności przeprowadzenia operacji wyrostka robaczkowego, and things are getting a little hot and heavy.

He's working his way down my neck, and I'm just about to pull him back into the bedroom when he stops and says he has something he has to tell me and oh great here I was thinking I was caught up in another greencard scam, but then he drops the bomb on me.

He's totally CIS!!

Like, the doctors said he was a boy, and like he agrees with them???

Needless to say, I kicked him out right then and there. He kept blubbering, and trying to make excuses like, ""we're 99% of the human population,"" but I knew better than to let him manipulate me like that because I have some sense of self-respect (at time of incident).

I think I should report him, but idk. I'm kind of exhausted and depleted and just want to move on from the whole thing, but I'm terrified he'll try it again with someone else?

tl;dr -- date turned out to be cis, am I right to be this upset or aio??",6,1746321423.0,transgendercirclejerk,2,0.8,False

She’s always been really flirty with me but nothing serious has ever happened outside of a drunk kiss here and there or something like that. We’ve spent more time together than I can count, and I’ve always been there to help her move, pick her up when she’s stranded places, and even once physically restrain a crazy ex of hers so that she could get her social out of his apartment. When we hang out, she makes me so happy. She takes me to concerts that are way too cool and underground for me to ever know about myself, she’s helped me pick out clothes that are nicer than anything I ever choose on my own, she’s always dancing with me and pushing me to try new things and making my smile and bringing like an outgoing, energetic vibe to my life that I, an introvert, really benefit from. On the other hand…she’s always available when SHE is reaching out to ME, but totally unreliable when I need something, or when a plan is my idea, or really just whenever literally anyone else wants to do something with her. She forgets birthdays and milestones, goes out and does fun shit without me unless other people flake, and then she’ll invite me at the last minute, and never replies to texts or anything until she’s got some plan she wants me in on, and then all the sudden it’s rapid fire. 

So

A few nights ago she called me crying at 1 in the morning. She got way too drunk at a bar and tried to start a fight and got thrown out. She had no money and no way to get home and couldn’t stop crying. So I drove out to pick her up, and she was like so drunk and I think also maybe high that she couldn’t even stand. I had to carry her five floors up her walk up to her apartment and put her in her bed. Then she started telling me how great I am and how she’s lucky to have me and trying to kiss me. But again, she was literally so drunk she couldn’t keep her eyes open. I left a bucket by the bed and told her to call me if she needed anything, and that if she wanted to hang in the morning, I’d pick her up and we could get coffee. 

Skip to 8pm the next day, she never texted me, never said a word, but I saw on her instagram story that she’s out doing shots at another bar. She’s done this to me a hundred times. And no matter how bad it hurts all I can ever think about is dancing with her and running on the boardwalk and her laugh and all the good stuff. I feel like shit. I want it to stop. I wish she cared.
