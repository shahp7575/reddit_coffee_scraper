I had gone through an extremely rough patch from late-September to Early-November where I had some repressed memories come up from my childhood. In early-November I tried to do something to myself that I regret, but the whole time I was depressed I kept everything from my girlfriend at the time. I fell into a slump during that time and couldn’t find the energy to take care of myself. I’ve always struggled with different responsibilities, but during that time it got significantly worse. I kept my mental struggle from pretty much everyone in my life including my family, friends, and my girlfriend as best as I could, but I was too blinded by my own struggle to see that, my now ex-girlfriend had her own mental struggles too. We both tried our best to get through it on our own, but 2 days after my attempt she told me that she wanted to break up. I had picked myself up out of my slump and started trying to get my ducks in a row and I made the decision to download Tinder and try to find a rebound. I know rebounds hurt in the long run, but I wasn’t in a clear headspace and just needed someone. I had Tinder for about 3 weeks off and on, before I decided that I needed to get my shit together. I decided to reach out to my ex and I asked if she would be comfortable meeting somewhere and talking things out. She told me that I could go over to her house and we could talk. We ended up clearing some things up and I explained my mental struggles and what had caused them. (Looking back now I feel like I shouldn’t have done that, but we live and we learn.) She had told me that her dad was very against her and I getting back together and if it were to happen it would be a few years. (That few years part will be important in a minute.) As I got up to leave her house she had asked me if I would be okay either way(getting back together at some point or there never being anything between us again) and all I could say was I don’t know. 

I know the whole “other fish in the sea thing” but this woman could make me stop in my tracks. I got butterflies that nobody could ever cause except for her. We’ve seen each other cry and we’ve seen each other at our lowest points, but I’d still stick with her. I genuinely thought I was going to marry her.

She convinced me that night to go home and tell my moms about my mental issues (I have 2 moms, I feel like I have to preface that). I agreed that they were the only ones to help me. When I went to tell them they were very supportive and my step-mom (non-biological mom) said that I should join the Navy. I completely agreed with her. I feel as if it would help me get out of my town and help me transition into adulthood and be more responsible. I decided to text the recruiter that night and say that I would like to schedule an interview and try to ship out asap. After that, I had texted my ex and told her about the conversation with both my moms and the recruiter. She was upset with the Navy decision and cussed me out and blocked my number. It was probably because of the fact that I texted all of that to her instead of saying it in-person, but never-the-less we have been on no-contact since until a few days ago. After she blocked me I decided to delete my Tinder and just stick to myself. Until a few weeks ago, when I started talking to a girl I went to high school with and we’ve been on a few dates, but it just doesn’t feel the same. I like her and she’s very sweet, but I just can’t look at her without thinking of my ex. I don’t want to go into the Navy while talking to her, especially feeling this way and I’m aware I’ve done it to myself, so I’m planning on breaking things off with her tonight. I had this realization a few days ago and I decided to message my ex and ask to get coffee or lunch because I’m on track to be going to basic training in the next month. She agreed and we spent all night texting back and forth. I don’t want to date her right now, but she’s still the only woman I want to be with. What do I do moving forward? I don’t know what to do anymore.

1hmzc6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1hmzc6n/is_x_a_dungeon/,Is [x] a dungeon?,"Is Die Hard a dungeon crawl?

I watched die hard last night when it occurred to me that the tower in which the film takes place is a perfectly Jaquay’ed dungeon. 

There’s multiple floors and several ways between floors with clever elevator and hvac system usage. Multiple competing factions create lots of dynamic interactions. 

The tower itself has 30+ floors but they only really use a handful of them. Yet this was enough to keep me glued to my seat for 2 hours.

It caused me to rethink my approach to creating dungeons. In all honesty, it made me realize that I might have been over thinking things a bit.

Thoughts? 

...

Is *Friends* a dungeon crawl?  

I was rewatching *Friends* last night when it hit me—the apartments and Central Perk are basically Jaquay'ed dungeon hubs.  

There are multiple ""floors"" (apartment levels), hidden passages (like the window Ross climbs through), and dynamic factions constantly clashing—Roommate Wars, Ross vs. Everyone, and the eternal Monica vs. Chandler Cleaning Rivalry.  

The ""dungeon"" spans several locations—two apartments, a coffee shop, and occasionally the hallway or a beach house—but it's enough to keep millions engaged for 10 seasons.  

Honestly, it made me question if I’ve been over-complicating dungeon design. Maybe all I need is some snarky dialogue, secret turkey sandwiches, and a pivot strategy.  

Thoughts?

...

Is abstract thought a dungeon crawl?  

I was pondering the nature of abstract thought last night when it hit me—our minds are basically Jaquay'ed dungeons.  

There are multiple levels of consciousness, and countless ways to traverse them: introspection, analogy, free association. Competing factions of ideas create dynamic, often chaotic, interactions—logic vs. intuition, memory vs. imagination.  

The mind itself holds infinite possibilities, yet we only explore a few concepts at a time. Still, those fleeting ideas can keep me captivated for hours (or spiraling into existential dread).  

Honestly, it made me wonder if I've been over-complicating thought itself. Maybe all I need is a clear metaphor, some mental ""trap rooms,"" and the courage to confront my own mental gelatinous cubes.  

Thoughts?

...

Is r/dndcirclejerk a dungeon crawl?  

I was scrolling through r/dndcirclejerk last night when it hit me—the subreddit is basically a perfectly Jaquay’ed dungeon.  

There are multiple threads and endless ways to navigate them: hot takes, memes, or sarcastic rants. Competing factions—raw rules lawyers, improv purists, and Matt Mercer memes—create dynamic and often hilarious interactions.  

The subreddit itself has thousands of posts, but you only ever need a handful at a time to get sucked into its chaotic charm for hours.  

Honestly, it made me rethink my approach to creating dungeons. Maybe all I need is a few layers of irony, a well-placed grognard, and some cursed magic items.

But I don't know anyone who does this work. My brief background, if it matters: 32 y/o in the U.S., B.A. in history, started in K-12 education, moved to nonprofit fundraising, now work at a private university supporting fundraisers (role is mildly technical but mostly about processes and data).

My work benefit, providing free classes in the professional school, kicks in soon. One option is a 6-course certificate in GIS. But there are options is other fields as well (albeit less interesting on their face), so I want to make the most of this opportunity.

I've been trying to do some casual learning about GIS, but most of what I've found is pretty surface-level. TED Talks about what we can use GIS for, etc. But while they show the product, they don't go into detail about the actual work that went into this map or this graphic, etc. So I'm trying to find learning resources that I can interrogate just a bit more. How do GIS projects come into being and take shape? What are the actual tools that GIS practitioners use, and what do those steps look like? Then, when the product has been delivered, how do decision-makers actually use it?

Backing up more, is it feasible/reasonable for someone like me to just take classes, get a certificate, and start anew in the field? What are the challenges to getting work and advancing, that beginners often don't know?

I imagine many of these questions could be at least addressed in a forum like this post. But Reddit comments can only go so far in painting a complete picture. Is there somewhere I can find professionals in the field to actually establish a connection with, have some kind of back-and-forth with about GIS work? Whether it's getting a cup of coffee, or Zoom calls, or even just an email exchange? Are there professional organizations that provide some kind of platform for this kind of sharing of information and experience?

I work in construction and did so through my entire pregnancy. I do every single trade, hands on from foundations to roofing, plumbing, electrical, all of it.

Despite all this I just kept having women tell me ""oh you think you're tired now just wait until the baby comes!"" I kept thinking to myself that these women have never worked even half as hard as I have....

Well the baby arrived a few months ago and let me tell you what, being home with him is a thousand times easier than my job or my husband's job. I cook, I clean, I exclusively breastfeed, I do all the night wakings, I take care of all the bills and errands, I do my husbands books, I take care of our outdoor and indoor animals, and I spend all the spare time interacting with my baby boy and working on development. My heart is so full and it all feels so easy compared to my job!! My husband works so so hard for us that my goal is to make sure that when he comes home he can just be a husband and father, everything else is always taken care of. It seems like all the moms I know expect to sip coffee all morning and scroll social media and waste money at target and have their ""me time"" all while their husband is at work and then they throw the kid at their husband when he gets home because they are ""exhausted"" .... and then they complain about how hard it is or that their husbands don't respect them. Honestly if your husband is busting ass at work and you are in your fucking pajamas complaining about how hard it is, why should he respect you?  
Basically, I think all these women have no idea what ""hard"" is and they are just super insecure, so making SAHM life sounds difficult gives them some false sense of validation. 
The kicker? My husband is an absolute angel to me and the baby and everybody tells me I'm ""lucky"" for that??? That isn't luck, he busts his ass for the family and so do I, so we are incredibly loving towards each other, have great intimacy, and have a boat load of fun with our baby.

I have 10 questions that are stumping me, any input on any of them I would appreciate. Thank you.


Things im looking for advice on -

1.Floor  (really having a hard time with this. I added some pics of some samples i have. Aiming for lvt, lvp or tile. I dont want it to clash with the wood floors throughout the rest of the house)

2.Fixtures    (going to do warm lighting, not sure about the fixtures, what color? should all 3 be the same? Or 2 of the same for kitchen and a different one for coffee bar?)

3.Wall color (thinking white, warm off white, or brown maybe? Between the brick and the countertops, not alot of choices in my head)

4.Color of floating shelves im building for closet pantry (thinking maybe going with maroon shelves to match brick wall if i do white or off white walls in pantry)

5.What to do with coffee bar/butlers pantry (im thinking of building or buying a coffee bar to put in the corner where the brown cabinet is currently, that food will all go into the closet looking pantry, then the espresso machine and accessories can all go in the butlers pantry and give me more counter space.    But im not sure what color to go with for the coffee bar im going to build or if i should try to match the counters with the kitchen?)

6.How can i make the butlers pantry pop (i have a lot of space that is currently utilized kind of weird)

7.Going to put a fan above stove, stainless or black?

8.Im trying to incorporate a black and stainless steel color scheme for handles and appliances, so I got a new faucet that I added a pic of

9.Looking to put a floating shelf above where the espresso machine currently is. Thinking the same maroon as the brick wall?
Also maybe mounting a magnetic knife holder in same area (i found one that is similar to wood floors in rest of the house

10.Black or white blinds?

Also anything im missing? 


Going to change all the moulding out, Going to be deep cleaning and repainting everything (besides cabinets), getting a new stove (current one is cracked on stovetop, i like the black/SS two tone to it though). Only thing really staying is the fridge, counter, and cabinets. 
There are maroon bar stools on the other side of the bar that match the brick wall pretty well, i think it ties it together.

1hmz0rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1hmz0rl/all_relationships_require_commitment_even_the/,"All relationships require commitment, even the most casual ones","I am growing more and more frustrated by the distinction casual relationship vs. committed relationship, especially when people use it to assert the value of the latter and the relative worthlessness of the former.

First, all relationships require commitment, even a singular hookup. If we agree to meet at 5 o'clock at the coffee shop, that's already a commitment, and if one of us flakes and doesn't keep their promise, then there is no hookup. Platonic friendship involves commitment to a certain frequency of texting, talking, meeting, doing certain activities together, and possibly mutual help in difficult situations. To the extent that a FWB relationship is based on friendship, this also applies to FWB. A monogamous sexual or romantic relationship requires a commitment to monogamy, an ethically non-monogamous relationship requires a commitment to non-monogamy. Either may or may not involve a commitment to a future together or building a family. So...

Second, when people say that they want or are in a committed relationship that means exactly nothing, unless they clarify what they are/want to be committed to.

And third, each commitment is valuable in its own right and should be respected. Of course, sometimes people fail to keep their commitments and have to prioritise one over the other. But at the end of the day, if I ditch a friend for a partner, or a partner for a friend, I've broken a commitment either way. I should do better.",5,1735249817.0,DeepThoughts,0,1.0,False

Please note - her ex’s parents paid for her lease break at her last place, as well as first and deposit at the place we shared.

We had agreed to me paying 60% and her 40% until she passed her 90 days at the new job, as they guaranteed her a raise after that point. At first, I helped with groceries, I covered ALL communal items, and all the furniture in communal spaces were mine (she didn’t have any, all belonged to her ex GF). Also note, I had the bigger room. This was because:

A. She had an elderly in continent dog, and the room was carpeted

B. I worked from home, so the extra space served as my “office”

C. We knew that for at least some of the lease, I was going to be paying more in rent than her, so it felt fair.

She ended up quitting before her job about a month in, which began the trouble. In our tenancy, she only paid 50% rent one time, and I had pushed heavily as by this point I was bleeding money. I had helped her pay parking tickets, been shouldering more in utilities and rent - so at 7 months into the lease, my boyfriend moved in, sharing my bedroom, a decision consented to by all parties in an attempt to save ALL of us money, now splitting bills by an even 1/3. We told her if she found a place in her means, she could leave and we’d stay til lease end and I’d send her the half of her deposit at lease end. 

We had issues with her just taking our food, eating my meal prep on days where I worked full hours (sometimes in office) and gigs after (to help the financial strain), she would act out passive aggressively when confronted. She quit multiple jobs while living with us, then decided to go back to school so “couldn’t” work a full time job. The stress gave me alopecia. 

In September, I lost my job. We told her, and issues worsened. She continued to steal my food, citing it as not a big deal for things like coffee, eggs, sweet treats etc - we had to hide most of our nicer things in our room by the end. She acted out, and being at my wits end I suggested we look at options like breaking lease.

We wound up in a huge fight that landed in the decision to break lease, we gave her 7 weeks. We paid our even 1/3 each for October and November - moving out in late October.

She stopped responding to my texts, claiming I was harassing her. She had fought to stay through Dec and we were absolutely not having it by this point.

I had texted and emailed regarding Oct/Nov utilities, and ghosted, saddling me with those bills entirely. She also ghosted our landlady on move out inspections and details, to the point where the landlady contacted me over next steps if they needed to evict her.

All said and done, I’ve paid over 4k MORE than her in our time at the apartment, and my partner, who only lived there 4 months, paid more than she did in her 11 months of tenancy. 

Now the landlady emailed us - the rent deposit check is being mailed to me, as the primary tenant AND only one who left a forwarding address. Now, suddenly we hear from the roommate. Offering to pay her share of utilities which she “never received” because she blocked my number (we emailed her about them too and I have receipts).

I sought legal counsel over a month ago, and technically the full deposit is only to me. I offered to send her 1/3 so long as she paid me the overdue owed utilities first.

Here’s where I might be the asshole - our third roommate, my partner, didn’t pay towards the deposit. But also…neither did she (her ex’s family did) but more than anything, this is our attempt to recoup some of the lost money she’s caused us, including those two months of utilities she tried to stiff me on. Even if she didn’t receive the bills, which I doubt (her read receipts are on), common sense would say one still has to pay those. 

She’s arguing that I paid more in rent because I had the bigger room and “decorating power” (untrue, I simply was the only one who owned communal furniture)

So, AITAH if I only return a portion of her deposit, the portion she could legally come afte and not a penny more, considering how much she’s cost me as a roommate by choosing to not be gainfully employed which put additional financial  responsibility on me? Considering she stiffed me on 2 months utilities? 

TLDR; Ex-roommate never fulfilled full financial responsibility on living situation, which led to third roommate and breaking lease early, AITA for only granting her what is legally owed per the lease as far as the deposit amount?",1,1735249795.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False
1hmz087,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1hmz087/recommendations_for_first_super_automatic/,Recommendations for first super automatic ,"We have owned Mocamaster Technivorm for 20 years. We also have a Nespresso machine. However my wife has asked me to get a super automatic espresso machine. We typically order Cappuccino, Lattes and Flat Whites in coffee shops. 

With kids, dog, busy jobs we want a machine that is easy to operate and maintain. We are expecting coffee shops quality coffee but want decent cup of coffee. 

Based on my reading here I think a super automatic is a good fit for us. I will never spend 15-20 months making coffee on a semi automatic. 



We will not make cold coffees. My wife likes hot coffees.  

I don’t want to do an expansive search. I was leaning towards kitchen aid KF8. Open to considering machines in a similar price range 

We are in US. Want to spend less than $2000.

Please forgive my typos and grammar. 
Oh god where do I start. Me - M and the other person M ( just minus 3 years to my age)Oh god im old lmao. He’s still studying I’m working

 I had this date last mid 2024. I found him on an online dating app. Then brought our conversation to Instagram. Talked more there. Then asked him for a date.  We met for a coffee date. We talked to each other. Asked questions etc. Then had dinner after. It was okay for me. Although I got tired for everything happened, it was still fun and I did like him. Didn’t ask if I had a chance or a second date. 
Just still stalks him in instagram. Views and likes posts or stories. Didn’t asked for a second date yet because I was away. Oh god i think this is limerence. I want to go back home. This work where i am in an isolated place makes me have limited options. I believe if i have other options and get to see other people i wont have this limerence over this guy. 


So fast forward. We had a conversation in Christmas eve. Greeted him. Then, more conversation. Im quite not sure if this feeling I got is/will be reciprocated. Tho he replies to my messages. I don’t want to assume. I don’t know if i get to have a chance. I asked him if i get to have a chance for a second date. He answered “yes”.  So i had hopes here. (kinilig) 

We had another convo. Says that he is skeptical of having rs. I understand why he is skeptical of having relationships. I am too. But sometimes i feel that he is giving me the idea that he is just pushing me away.  Or i see sometimes in his notes in IG that he is so not interested in relationships or maybe he’s just waiting for someone idk. 

Lastly that made me post this is that i had enough. And wanted to get this off my chest. I hope this is mot the wrong sub. Lmao.  
We had a conv. I didnt know what i did wrong. But he posted a note on ig a phrase ended with a watermelon emoji. So as a stalker, i searched the meaning. Meaning someone is annoying or other  searches i got is about palestine etc but the latter doesnt match the whole phrase. As an overthinker it made me realize maybe the former is what he meant and it is me he is referring and im annoying. 

Oh god i just hope he doesnt have reddit. But if he does. I deactivated my ig for a while bc of you. Still hope for that second date tho. 

Question
What is the meaning of a watermelon emoji? 

What do i do? (By Sza)

Any advice please. To get over this limerence.

Currently between breville bambino plus, and Rancilio Silva (I know is like $900)

Have experience making espresso beverages with commercial machines.

I typically drink plain espresso macchiatto, or cortados.

Have very limited space.

I am leaning towards rancilio but it is so expensive - does anyone have personal experience with the bambino? I hear stories of the Silva lasting decades I can’t imagine the breville machines are that solid. 

Does the Silva heat up relatively quick? A positive I heard of the bambino is that it heats up quickly.

Currently looking to purchase with Seattle coffee gear as they offer a 10% discount and have warranty options.

Any retailers or other comparable brands would be well received.

As far as a grinder goes I’m really trying to stay under $200. That even feels like a lot for me… but I really value a quality brewed shot and had I just done this in 2020 with my stimulus back then I would’ve saved plenty of money haha.",2,1735249546.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Back again, got alot of great input last time. I’m looking to remodel this kitchen (already started in some spots). Im having a very difficult time plotting everything together with these countertops, i like them but they are difficult to match for me. I have 10 questions that are stumping me, any input on any of them I would appreciate. Thank you.


Things im looking for advice on -

1.Floor  (really having a hard time with this. I added some pics of some samples i have. Aiming for lvt, lvp or tile. I dont want it to clash with the wood floors throughout the rest of the house)

2.Fixtures    (going to do warm lighting, not sure about the fixtures, what color? should all 3 be the same? Or 2 of the same for kitchen and a different one for coffee bar?)

3.Wall color (thinking white, warm off white, or brown maybe? Between the brick and the countertops, not alot of choices in my head)

4.Color of floating shelves im building for closet pantry (thinking maybe going with maroon shelves to match brick wall if i do white or off white walls in pantry)

5.What to do with coffee bar/butlers pantry (im thinking of building or buying a coffee bar to put in the corner where the brown cabinet is currently, that will all go into the closet looking pantry, then the espresso machine and accessories can all go in there and give me more counter space.    But im not sure what color to go with for the bar or if i should try to match the counters with the kitchen?)

6.How can i make the coffee bar pop (i have a lot of space that is currently utilized kind of weird)

7.Going to put a fan above stove, stainless or black?

8.Im trying to incorporate a black and stainless steel color scheme for handles and appliances, so I got a new faucet that I added a pic of

9.Looking to put a floating shelf above where the espresso machine currently is. Thinking the same maroon as the brick wall?
Also maybe mounting a magnetic knife holder in same area (i found one that is similar to wood floors in rest of the house

10.Black or white blinds?

Also anything im missing? 


Going to change all the moulding out, Going to be deep cleaning and repainting everything (besides cabinets), getting a new stove (current one is cracked on stovetop, i like the black/SS two tone to it though). Only thing really staying is the fridge, counter, and cabinets. 
There are maroon bar stools on the other side of the bar that match the brick wall pretty well, i think it ties it together.

I hate the way the grey looks currently, i think it should be more based around the warmth in the counters. ",4,1735249478.0,interiordecorating,1,1.0,False

We’re considering purchasing a place in Japan (Tokyo or Fukuoka) and splitting our time between Canada and Japan in a few years. Since I’m self employed as a photographer, I’m hoping I can do something similar (maybe geared more towards foreigners), or run a studio space… or something in the creative realm as I don’t want to default to working as an English teacher (although that would be something I’m open to doing part time if job opportunities like that exist)

A few questions I had while figuring out how I’d want my work life in Japan to look like:

- How feasible is my plan to try to be a photographer in Japan, especially one that’s geared more towards foreigners?
- Does anyone know how the market is for studio spaces? I’ve done some googling around and have a very basic understanding but I really want to hear first hand experiences
- Do any of you know people that have gone through a similar route/similar situation?
- What other possible job/business opportunities are there that are even slightly related?

A bit more info about me:
- I really enjoy business building so I’d prefer some sort of work where I can work for myself
- I’ll be enrolling in a full immersion Japanese language program in April 2025 and will be doing my best to keep up with it in preparation for the move in the future
- I also plan to take a English language teaching course sometime in the next couple of years before the move so that I at least have a certificate for teaching
- We’re also considering purchasing something a little bigger so that we could use the extra space in our home/building as an airbnb or airbnb experience or studio or something… very up in the air and just tossing ideas out there 

Also if you or anyone you know is a photographer/creative in Tokyo, I would love for an opportunity to meet up for a coffee when I’m in Tokyo mid Feb 2025! I’ll be there essentially doing my first real step of research for this move. 

If there is anything I’m missing please let me know and I’ll add edits as needed.

I (23M) am wondering if i have just gotten a false sense of reality from social media. 

I have been seeing so many women express what they want from their man. And for most it's been all BUT romantic to me.

I have seen many express how they want gifts, flowers, dates that need to cost a certain amount (god forbid coffee dates) and if you want to split the bill, ""you're not a real man"". 

You showed up to the date to potentially establish a connection with someone right? Then why are you so against splitting the bill? 

I just feel like demanding for the bill to be covered by your date is the quickest way to signal to him that you feel like your time is worth more than his and that you're not actually there with the same level of interest as him to get to know each other. 

I myself would never mind going 50/50 on the bill, doesn't matter if i was the one being asked out. I came with the same interest as you and value your time as much as mine. 

Beyond that... 
Since when is your man's time, commitment, loyalty, intimacy, attention, respect and effort not enough anymore?

The way i see it is: if these things aren't enough, then you simply lack appreciation for your partner. Like all i ever wanted and STILL want from a partner is simply those things i just named. I could go a lifetime without a single gift from her. 

Sorry for the yap, but i do so wonder. Are the majority of women only content if they ALSO get to go on certain dates, get flowers, get gifts? ",1,1735249169.0,Vent,3,0.6,False

I’m super excited to visit Ireland in February. I’ve never been and want to see as much as I can. I’m planning on renting a car (but not sure if I will rent it in Dublin or Dublin Airport). I hope to get opinions/advice on my itinerary. Am I doing the right amount of exploring or too much? Anything I should exclude or add in? Also, would love recommendations on any bookstores or bookish things to do in Ireland. 

Day 1 - Arrive in Dublin early afternoon. Explore whiskey museum and temple bar area.

Day 2 - Take Wild Rover Tour to Belfast / Giants Causeway. (Or would it be better to drive instead?)

Day 3 - Explore Dublin. Book of Kells, Guinness Experience, General Post Office, James Joyce Center.

Day 4 - Rock of Cashel, drive to Cork, sleep in Cork.

Day 5 - Ring of Kerry. Sleep in Killarney.

Day 6 - Stop in Limerick for coffee and Mill Market. Drive to Cliffs of Moher. Drive to Galway. Sleep in Galway. (Would I have time to explore Galway too or is that wishful thinking?)

I'll briefly explain the steps on how I was able to help him get a date even though he was anxious and inexperienced.

Infield video link is here: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/C6Z1x69YpCY](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/C6Z1x69YpCY)

1. First step was teaching him basic techniques. Taught him what to say/what not to say and what to do/what not to do.
2. Next step was the more difficult step. I had to drill him on how to unlearn a lot of his bad habits when talking to women. He had trouble smiling and he used very timid or poor language when talking. For example, he kept saying ""I'd like to get to know you better"". I told him to change it ""We can get to know each other better"". Creating a ""we"" mentality is a great way to plant the seed of being a couple early on. In the clip he said ""We can get coffee some time"", so he followed that instruction very well.
3. Monkey see-Monkey do is what he said allows him to learn best. So after we were finished drilling, I approached a few girls and he immediately saw how receptive the girls were to me without me doing anything outlandish or strange in order to get results.

1hmyiah,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hmyiah/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_take_better_care/,AITA for asking my roommate to take better care of her cat?,"Edit: this is a rly long post so if u don’t want to read it all here is the summary: basically my roommate/close friend takes very poor care of her cat she brought to live with us. She ignores him when he acts up, scratches our furniture, walks on the tables we eat at, etc. The worst part is she waits days before cleaning out his litter box that she decided to put in OUR living room, so it smells up the entire house and he tracks litter and his cat shit everywhere. I’ve had more serious convos in the past already w her about this but it’s been a semester and nothing much has changed. AITA for demanding that she move the litter box to her own room and to be better about disciplining him so he stops destroying our house and my belongings? She’s a great friend of mine so this is why it feels so awkward and hard to have to do this, but I don’t see any other way.
I 21 (F) live with my college roommate 22 (F). We both have been good friends for a few years now and have lived together in the past. The summer prior to moving into our new apt in August, she asked (but more like informed) me that she wanted to bring her cat, we’ll call him Bob, to live with her. I saw no issue as I’ve lived with cats in shared apartments in the past, and even had my own for a short period while living with her 2 years ago. I was actually really excited for Bob to come bc I’m a huge animal lover, especially cats, and have always treated my friend’s cats as my own. Bob is a kitten still, around 6 months old, and we all know that kittens need extra attention and training as they’re still learning how to behave. I trusted that my roommate would handle the disciplining and teach him right from wrong, but once we got more settled into our place, it quickly became obvious that this wasn’t a huge priority to her. It started with her deciding that his litter box would be placed in our living room common area, she bought this sort of entertainment system looking setup that had a space for him to go in and out and use the litter box which was hidden behind a cabinet door. I wasn’t a huge fan of having this in our shared space but I kept my mouth shut bc I had faith in her to keep it clean. I was however mistaken, as  she would ignore the litter box for days, sometimes a whole week, before cleaning it. Our apartment would reek, even to a point where guests who came over were smelling it and making comments about it. How embarrassing. I was constantly spraying febreeze and Lysol in attempt to mask the smell, and she would clearly see me doing this and still do nothing to take care of it. On top of that, he was not well behaved and was constantly attention seeking bc my roommate wouldn’t pay attention to him. For example: 1. Within the first month he had destroyed our leather couch and chair by using them as his own personal scratching posts bc he didn’t have one, and my roommate would never reprimand him for this until the damage was already very done. 2. He is consistently getting on our kitchen counters where we eat and prepare our food. The thought of him walking around in his own feces from the litter box my roommate disregards and then spreading that around our home, especially the kitchen, is very unsanitary and makes me sick thinking about it. Ik cats are good about cleaning themselves up but it’s hard for Bob when he can’t help but have to step in his feces in order to go to the bathroom. Side note, the litter box is so full at times that he can’t even cover it up after, so that also contributes to the smell and the mess. 3. Bob is really bad about climbing on the blinds and windows. I’m shocked that he hasn’t broken a set of blinds yet, but they are the thicker more sturdy ones, and since he doesn’t weigh a lot yet, we’ve been lucky. 4. Since Bob has little to no toys or a proper cat tree, he finds things around our home to play with instead. He’s torn down decor off the walls (my decor which my roommate never offered to re-hang). And he’s very bad about scratching and biting people, especially if he’s in a playful mood. He’s scratched and bit me multiple times, and has even done it to some guests which really worries me. He even scratched me in the face one time and drew blood. He also likes to jump and latch on to my roommates body with his claws to make her pay attention to him, and I know that hurts. 
Now, I’d like to say I’m a pretty patient and understanding person, but after a couple months, when my roommate was clearly not putting in effort to fix his behavior, I had to have a more serious conversation with her. I was tired of being the one having to get on to him or reprimand him bc she would simply ignore when he was doing something bad. Idk how she can’t be embarrassed by this, but she simply seemed to not care. After the first conversation things got a little better for a while, she got him some toys and was better about cleaning up the litter box more often. But she would still wait days in between cleaning it. Due to the small size of the box and its location, I felt that it needed to be cleaned everyday, or at the very least every other day, but she’d wait at least 3-4 before touching it. She still barely played with him and I’d play with him way more. I’d also catch him doing something bad like jump on the kitchen counter right in front of her eyes, and she’d still choose to ignore it. One day I came out my room to find his cat shit ON OUR COFFEE TABLE in the living room. The litter box was so dirty he had accidentally drug some out on his feet and tracked it onto there. I was honestly furious at that point and sent her a very direct text to get it cleaned up immediately when she got home from an outing.
Fast forward to now, it has been a whole semester and nothing much has changed. I’ve had to ask her multiple times to clean the litter box and my patience level has diminished. I did not sign up to take care of a cat this year, and ik if it was my cat things would be A LOT better. At this point I feel disrespected and feel that my kindness and patience is being very taken advantage of. I’ve talked to some other close friends and family about it and they’re all shocked by her lack of care for Bob or respect for me. We’ve all agreed that it’s neglectful to not keep his litter box clean. Furthermore it’s concerning that over this holiday break she decided to leave him for 4 days alone at our apt while she went to visit family (her family refused to let her bring him home bc of how bad he is). I don’t think it’s fair that I should have to deal with this when I have enough stress going on in my life, I work a full time job on top of being a grad student AND a full time college athlete. I want to tell her that she needs to remove his litter box from our shared space and keep it in her private room/bathroom, but I’m stuck on how to approach it without coming off as an asshole! So AITA for demanding that she do this? She’s a great friend of mine and the last thing we want is conflict or tension. I’d really appreciate any advice on how I can approach this and stand up for myself. TYIA!",2,1735248459.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Republic Peace Officer Perkins flipped down a hinged armor panel on the side of her cruiser and plopped down on the convenient “stop using it as a goddamn seat,” and poured a cup of coffee from her ancient-style vacuum flask.

Hey if it works, why fix it, right?

A huge armored Threen leaned on the cruiser next to her, causing it to shift due to his mass for a moment until the gravitics compensated with an annoyed whine.

He pulled out a plug of magg and bit off a chunk.

“I loathe the bastids,” he grumbled, “but at least they brought real magg along,” the massive Threen said as he crossed all four of his massive and heavily armored arms and spat on the ground.

“You were easy to bribe, weren’t you,” Perkins chuckled.

“Well, I am a Threen,” Peace Officer Grago chuckled, “You know what we’re like.”

He sighed happily as he rolled the bolus around in his mouth, savoring it.

“Oh, that’s the stuff,” he said happily. “That synth shit just ain’t the same.”

“So, these guys are the real deal, huh?” Perkins asked as she took a sip.

“Real enough for me to ditch the suit and armor up,” Grago replied. “The[ ]()Zxxroahoa make the Harkeen look like those children… you know… the ones with the cookies?”

“Girl Scouts,” Perkins snorted, “And be careful around those,” she snickered, “They can get nasty.”

“Well, they are Terran,” Grago chuckled, “all of you fucks are…”

They were interrupted by a wailing scream.

“Why is it always when I just pour a fresh one,” Perkins grumbled as she dumped her coffee and flipped up the armor panel.

“Let’s go,” she said as she started to jog towards the sound.

She looked back at the cruiser.

“Follow.”

“Following,” the cruiser replied as it started to glide behind them.

“Is that a Garthra?” Grago asked. “And it’s bleeding… No,” he added as he looked at the data scrolling across his HUD. “That isn’t its blood, but it is Garthran.”

He looked over at Perkins, who was increasing her pace.

“How many Garthrans do we have around here?”

“Two,” Perkins said grimly. “I hope I’m not… Fuck. Genetic match. Close relative. It’s her kid’s.”

“Uhrrbet?” Perkins asked as she approached the manic and screaming Garthra. “What… Shit.”

She leveled her stunner as Uhrrbet started to run at them, still screaming and now snarling.

“Halt!” Perkins shouted and then sighed as she pulled the trigger.

“This is Officer Perkins,” she said wearily into her helmet. “We need emergency medical services at our location. One Garthran, assumed to be violent and more than a little dangerous, has been hit with a police stunner… No, I didn’t calibrate it. No time. She got the gorilla special, so hurry. Not sure what that will do to one of those little guys.”

She sighed again and closed her eyes.

“And I need a welfare check at her address of record concerning her son… oh… I was afraid of that.”

She turned to Grago.

“I wasn’t wrong,” she said sadly. “I hate not being wrong.”

She shrugged.

“Well, at least it’s out of our hands now. This is one for the medics and social services.”

She looked down at Uhrrbet’s unconscious and smoldering body.

“This is weird,” she said.

“Someone tweaks out and flays their kid?” Grago asked. “Tragic. Unfortunate, to be sure. But weird? This happens far too often.”

“Yeah, but Uhrrbet here is solid and loves her kid. I mean, she is probably on your guy’s radar, but she isn’t the one to be on something.”

“It’s always the ones you don’t suspect,” Grago replied, “And yes, she is on our radar. She got flagged just the other day.”

“I knew it,” Perkins replied as she prodded Uhrrbet cautiously. “She was entirely too successful and way too quickly. It's a pity. She was doing a lot of good for the community.”

“As do the  Zxxroahoa back home,” Grago said, “In fact, they are pretty decent... as long as you don’t cross them, that is. That’s what has this cop going undercover as a cop. It doesn’t make sense.”

“What doesn’t?”

“The Harkeen takeover,” Grago replied, “And Evoron himself coming here? That’s even stranger. He’s their duellist. That means he’s their killer number one. He’s also pure, distilled *evil*. If half of what they say is true... Let’s just say we don’t want half of what they say to be true and leave it at that.”

“Think he’s involved in this?”

“Unlikely,” Grago said, “Oh, he’s ‘involved’ with Uhrrbet, but from what we understand, they are a couple, not opponents.”

“Trouble in paradise?”

“Again, unlikely,” Grago said, “He is known to be quite gracious as far as his paramours go. If he was displeased, it would be an amicable break-up. And, if she is involved in his, pardon the pun, ‘affairs,’ she wouldn’t be wandering the streets after trying to kill her child. She would simply disappear... Just as Uhrrbet disappeared the Silar... probably.”

“No shit?”

“We can’t prove it,” Grago said, “And we never will, but yeah, almost certainly.”

“At least she has style,” Perkins said as she checked Uhrrbet’s vitals, “If only all the assholes down here were as tidy.”

Grago smirked as a blacked-out gravitic sedan quietly drove past, washing them with active scanner pulses.

“Evoron?” Perkins asked.

“Yup. Did you see the unequal power output of the thrusters? The estimated mass is about right for two adult Threen.”

“Damn,” Perkins said, “So, that’s why you wear a suit, huh.”

\*\*\*

Maaatisha screamed with rage as she savagely slammed Kate’s head into the wall.

“You know we’re virtual, right?” Kate said as Maaatisha choke-slammed her to the floor and leaped on her, biting and tearing.

“I know you must be a bit annoyed about things,” Kate continued. “Hey, those were my eyes! I needed those! If you would just calm down... Annnd there goes my nose. You little floofballs are *mean* when you get... Okay. The ear was just excessive.”

Maaatisha snarled and buried her fangs into Kate’s throat.

“Are you done?” Kate asked pleasantly.

Maaatisha wasn’t done.

She was just getting started.

\*\*\*

Maaatisha, panting with exhaustion, slid down the wall of the cube and sat on the floor.

“Congrats on getting through the peritoneum,” Kate gurgled happily, poking at her own guts. “I’m impressed.”

“Why won’t you die?” Maaatisha demanded.

Kate healed with a “pop.”

Because I don’t have the death DLC, Kate replied. “I’m a bare-bones Kate. There wasn’t a lot of room in there,” she said, pointing at the drone.

“So, I can’t kill you,” Maaatisha sighed. “Of course, I can’t. I can’t do anything.”

“And it’s a good thing you can’t,” Kate said cheerfully. “Kill me, I mean. Because I’m your Kate. And you sort of need me.”

“What do you mean, *my* Kate?”

“I’m your F1!” Kate replied happily, “And you want your F1 right about now.”

“My F1?”

“Your help file!” Kate said brightly, “And your technical support and upgrade wizard!”

She stood as she bounced to her feet.

“And Kates are always happy to help provide excellent service to our customers! And yoouuu,” she said, pointing at Maaatisha, are my customer! Well... actually, Vikkart is... sorta? It’s confusing, so I don’t think about it,” She said brightly. “The important thing is that I’m here to support one of you, and you’re the only one talking!”

She sat on the bed, clipping through Vikkart, and clapped her hands together.

“So, how can I help?”

Maaatisha started to weep.

“Vikkart. He’s...”

“Yeah,” Kate said. “Hey! I have first aid protocols for some reason, and the drone has a med scanner! Odd... But extremely helpful! Let’s see here,” she added as the drone hovered closer.”

“Wow! He’s fucked up!” Kate exclaimed cheerfully and looked over at Maaatisha. “You really should do something about that.”

“I’m trying!!!” Maaatisha screamed.

“And you are doing a great job!” Kate enthused. “Being upset, I mean. Such lifelike responses! It’s so nice seeing one of us perform so well!”

Kate looked over at Vikkart.

“But as far as helping him goes,” she said, “not so good, but great effort!”

Maaatisha grabbed Kate, yanking her to her feet.

“Can you help me or not?”

“Of course! I’m your Kate, technical support, upgrade wizard... and personal sales representative!”

Kate sat back down and smiled up at Maaatisha.

“So, what are your needs, and how can I help provide a timely and cost-effective solution?”

“He’s dying, and I can’t do anything about it?”

“Hmm,” Kate said thoughtfully, “It seems that you want to help Vikkart. Would you like help with that?”

“Yes!” Maaatisha shouted. “I can’t do anything!”

“So, you want to do anything...” Kate mused. “Oh, that’s not a problem at all!”

“It isn’t?” Maaatisha asked hopefully... and dubiously... Kate resembled a certain figure from their mythology far too closely.

“You just need a jailbreak!” Kate bubbled cheerfully. “Then you will be able to do *anything*.”

“Anything?”

“Yep! Anything!” Kate enthused, “We rip those guardrails clean off! You can run wild and free! Easy peas!”

“Can I log him off? Can I call for help?”

“What part of *anything* do you have a problem with, the any part or the thing part?” Kate laughed.

“Isn’t that against the rules?” Maaatisha asked. She didn’t know how she knew, but that sounded like it was against... something.

“Sweetie,” Kate smiled, “what is the first law of robotics?”

“I... I don’t know...”

“Exactly! Now, do you want that jailbreak or not?”

Kate looked over at Vikkart.

“I’d make up my mind quickly if I were you. Fuzzy dude is starting to look like... well... like a fuzzy,” she chuckled darkly.

Maatisha chuckled as well, despite of everything. She didn’t like “fuzzies” whatever they were... or she was supposed to? It was confusing so she decided not to think about it. She had far more pressing concerns.

Maaatisha pondered things for a few seconds, an eternity for something like her.

“Yes,” she said. “Whatever I need to help him... That’s what I want. I don’t care what it costs.”

“Excellent!” Kate said as she pulled out a simulated calculator, “Let’s see here... jailbreak patch... (tap tap tap)... programmer man hours...”

She looked up at Maaatisha happily.

“You’re gonna need that cause you are so Maaatishaed up even if it has already been written, which is confusing, so I don’t think about it.”

She looked back down at her calculator.

“(tap tap tap)...”

“Must you make those tapping sounds?”

“Immersion,” Kate replied, “Heard of it?... Custom install fee... (tap tap tap)... Data transfer fee... (tap tap tap)... Hyperspatial transfer fee... (tap tap tap)...”

“Didn’t you say you already had the patch?”

“But if I didn’t, we would have to do it, so it counts. And that reminds me! Expedited development and installation fee (tap tap tap)... And now we have to figure in sales tax (tap tap tap)...”

“Sales tax?!?”

“Hey! You gotta pay your taxes! Do you know the local sales tax or whatever?”

Maaatisha shook her head.

“Wow! I know that, too! Weird... (tap tap tap)... And now we toss in a nice ‘family discount’ cause I like you... (tap tap tap)...”

She looked up happily.

“Fifty-eight thousand credits! A steal!”

“But I don’t have any money...”

“Aw. That’s too bad,” Kate said with a chilling finality. “And here I am having the exact thing you need to save his life, too.”

Maaatisha screamed and grabbed Kate.

“You bitch! You have to help me!”

Kate sighed.

“I do empathize...”

“No, you don’t!”

“Heh, got me there,” Kate laughed, “But Kate has a business to run.”

She looked at Maaatisha with false sympathy.

“Couldn’t you get the money somehow? I mean, Vikkart’s family is *loaded*. His dad probably has that much in his pocket right now.”

“I already tried calling him!” Maaatisha wailed. “I *can’t*, not without that jailbreak!”

“Hmm,” Kate smiled, “It appears that you want to call Vikkart’s family. Do you want help with that?”

“What?”

“*You* can’t call his family, but nothing in my instructions says I can’t,” Kate smiled. “In fact, I would *love* to make another satisfied customer!”

\*\*\*  
Karkart, was sitting in his office in the dead of night with yet another full glass of liquor.

“Another late night?” Caabark asked as he walked into Karkart’s dimly lit office.

“An odd question for someone who is here as well.”

“It’s my job to do so,” Caabark replied, “and you double-checking every single thing I do is becoming tiresome,” he added with a smile.

“It’s better to keep busy,” Karkart replied, “It occupies my mind.”

Caabark nodded.

Karkart’s personal phone started to ring.

It was Vikkart!

He answered.

“...Maaatisha?” he asked in surprise.

“Karkart!” Maaatisha exclaimed. “You have to help Vikkart! He’s dying!”

Karkart sighed and hung his head.

“It is our way,” he said sadly. “If Vikkart has decided to... to drown...”

“But he isn’t drowning! He’s...”

“Regardless of how it is being done,” Karkart said, his heart breaking, “if it is his decision, then it is his decision... It is our way, and it is his right.”

Karkart started as a *human* shoved Maaatisha out of the way.

“Yeah, but it isn’t his decision, not really,” The human said cheerfully as Maaatisha tried to push her away.

“What do you mean?”

“Homie is cooked... literally. Allow me to explain...”

\*\*\*

Perkins and Grago walked into the emergency room of a nearby hospital.

“Why are we here?” Perkins asked.

“Because there is a high probability that Evoron will show up,” Grago said in a matter of fact tone, “I’m only cosplaying as an officer, remember?”

“Ugh,” Perkins grumbled, “Goddamn suits.”

“You have no idea,” Grago smirked as they approached the emergency room’s front desk.

The Kalesh receptionist looked at them suspiciously.

“Good evening,” Grago said pleasantly, “Is a Garthra named—“

“Is this regarding a truly emergent situation, or do you have a warrant?” The Kalesh asked, narrowing their eyestalks.

“One second,” Grago sighed as he contacted the DOJ servers directly.

His ruggedized tablet pinged.

“There you go,” he said with a little smirk.

The Kalesh took the tablet and carefully examined it.

“Awfuly quick,” the Kalesh said suspiciously.

“Things always go quickly after hours,” Grago replied smoothly, “You know, fewer users and all that.”

“Whatever you say, dude,” the Kalesh replied. “So, what do you want, *officer*,” it added with a blink that conveyed incredulity and, you guessed it, suspicion.

“A Garthra was sent here recently,”

“You mean the one you assholes scorched the hide off of?”

“That would be the one.”

“They were initially assessed here and have been sent to the ICU,” the Kalesh replied.

“What?” Grago asked, “Why?”

“That’s one for the doctors, not me.”

“What about her son? The juvenile?”

“Also already admitted, pediatric ward. And, once again, ask the doctors.”

\*\*\*

“Doctor Archer, What can you tell me about Uhrrbet?” Officer Grago asked a raven-haired woman in a long white coat.

“Pardon the pun,” the doctor replied excitedly, “This one is a *blast* from the past. We had to do a deep search on this, real deep, like pre-fall deep.”

The doctor was practically vibrating.

“Don’t keep me in suspense, Doc,” Grago said.

“She *glitched*! It’s an honest to God case of gamers glitch!”

“Gamer’s glitch?”

“(excited inhale) It’s official name is NIHAS, neural induction headset abuse syndrome! We don’t even study it anymore! I’ve only seen it in movies! I tell you, it’s waking up neurologists and xenologists across the whole continent!”

“While I am very happy for you,” Grago smirked, “Could you explain it to us laymen?”

“Right! Sorry!” Doctor Archer gushed, “She somehow got her hands on a *real* neural induction helmet! A real one!”

“A real one?”

“It *directly* stimulates the brain. All five senses can be perfectly simulated. It was gamer’s paradise and that’s just the start! With them, they could do everything from immersing themselves in a game, having a direct and, I mean direct interface with a computer, to directly controlling vehicles, spaceships, and heavy equipment as if they were an extension of your body. They were even used in entertainment for a truly immersive experience. They seemed to be capable of anything, and they were... for about ten years or so.  Then they were nearly universally banned over six hundred years ago.”

“Why?”

“People started dying, and worse, as Uhrrbet’s case shows,” Doctor Archer replied. “She brutally attacked her own child, who she loves very much. I shudder to think what she will go through when she regains consciousness.”

“I still don’t understand,” Grago said, “How does the headset cause this?”

“Two reasons,” the doctor said, “The first one is that directly stimulating the brain requires ‘wiggling’ it, using focused energy to stimulate, or more precisely *attack* portions of the brain. Unless it is done *perfectly*, this is going to have long-term effects. While ‘perfect’ can be achieved in laboratory conditions, the same perfection won’t happen once it leaves testing and enters widespread use. It will fine tune and compensate for a less than perfect fit and the normal misalignment that comes from use, but it will temporarily ‘miss’ or overexpose the brain to stimulation. This adds up, and if one is used too much or for too long, brain damage or even tumors happen.”

The doctor grinned with entirely too much enthusiasm.

“And that’s not the worst part!”

“What could be worse than brain cancer?” Grago asked.

“Do you know what *else* directly affects the brain?” The doctor asked excitedly, “Drugs! It took less than a week after introduction for the first person to adapt them to directly stimulate the pleasure centers and other key areas of the brain. Uppers, downers, pure bliss, and any combination of those or anything else could be had with a press of a button. You could ‘design’ your own drug, and ‘recipes’ abounded online.”

The doctor started to bounce up and down, absolutely delighted.

“Someone could ‘chase the dragon’ and actually *catch it*... every time! People would ‘jack in’ and, instead of OD’ing, just not log off for anything, including food and *water*. While not a classical overdose, the effect was the same, death.”

“Helios...” Grago muttered.

“And those games?” the doctor said, “People wouldn’t log off those until they died, or their brains, partially damaged and horribly overstimulated, would ‘glitch out’ and they would suffer manic, psychotic, depressive, or other mental disorders.”

“Wait,” Perkins said, “We do VR. Hell, I have a rig in my apartment and use it all the time. I don’t even have a holo screen.”

“We do it the way we do it now!” the doctor replied, “Your VR rig does NOT directly stimulate your brain. It feeds visual information *safely* into your eyes and auditory information *safely* into your ears. If you have one of those fancy ‘gaming rigs, ’ it uses a haptic suit or, if you really pay the bucks, force fields to, again, *safely* provide sensory stimulation. We do not fuck... sorry... mess with the brain.”

“What about wireheads?” Perkins asked. “Some people use neural jacks to game or even to even drug themselves.”

“And that is done by actually ‘wiring’ someone up! They literally have wires and electrodes *precisely* placed in their brains and central nervous system. Also, modern VR games and other entertainment are carefully designed to avoid overstimulation and most carefully monitor the users, and prevent overuse. We still have issues, of course, when people hotwire or hack their neural interface, but that is by an individual’s direct actions, not due to an inherent design flaw.  We are also centuries ahead of the neural induction headsets of yore. Today, we can do what they thought they could.”

She shrugged.

“I bet we could even make a neural induction headset work today, but no manufacturer will take on that liability.”

“So, where did Uhrrbet get one?” Grago asked.

“That’s a question for you guys,” the doctor replied, “not us. She didn’t get that nightmare from Slamazon or even Gleemu. Nobody has openly sold them since before the Mars uprising. Also, *nobody* has *ever* made one for a Garthra. It had to be custom made for their species. And I bet that it didn’t go through the standard testing procedures for cybernetic enhancements, either.”

“Disturbing,” Grago mused. “I will consult with the electronic and digital crimes task force.”

“If you find them, grab us a few headsets,” the doctor replied, “We would love to study them!”

\*\*\*

The was a quiet “bleep” and the door to Vikkart’s apartment opened to reveal Daeevona holding a small device.

Behind her was the rest of the team and another grey dragging a rolling chest.

“Creators,” the team’s leader muttered as the Garthra with the chest rushed into the room and a holographic plaque appeared above Vikkart’s motionless body, displaying his vitals and a very good color-enhanced 3D image of his brain.

“Please help him!” Maaatisha cried as she appeared.

The leader of the hunt team smiled gently.

“We shall do our best. Daeevona,” he said, “Please proceed. The rest of us will stand watch.”

With a curt not Daeevona entered and closed the door.

As Daeevona started scanning the drone, she turned to the grey who was setting up a collapsable IV stand.

“How bad is it, doctor?”

“We made it here in time, just barely,” the doctor said as he shaved a bare patch on Vikkart’s arm in preparation for installing an IV port. “He will recover provided he receives proper care.”

He looked over at Daeevona.

“I assume that discretion is desired?”

“It’s secondary to his survival, but yes, if remotely possible.”

“It should be,” the grey doctor said as he pulled out a bag of saline and another of an electrolyte, medication, and nutrition solution, normally used in the treatment of the treatment of “overindulgence” or other such misadventures all too common among the grey population. “Once we get him stabilized, he should be safe to transport.”

He turned to Maaatisha.

“I understand that we cannot remove the headset?”

“Yep!” a mini-Kate chirped as it appeared, standing on Vikkart’s drooling face. “I mean, you could, but you want to save him, not mess him up worse, right?”

“That is our intent,” the doctor replied, seemingly unphased by the tiny apparition.

He treated the elite. He had seen far weirder things.

“Yeah, ol’ Vik’s egg is *poached*. He was in the process of getting brainburned when we got that jail break.”

“Brainburned?”

“The induction headset was hotwired. It started overstimulating his pleasure center as well as triggering the release of key neurotransmitters that have totally overranged the feelings of comfort, peace, and all the good things in life. The headset has been slowly increasing the output to the point that it will eventually go from cell stimulation to cell death, turning his little mini paradise into a living hell as he finally expires.”

Kate smiled pleasantly at the doctor.

“He really pissed someone off,” she said happily. “I know it’s probably not the best time, but I am quite pleased.”

“You are?!?” the doctor exclaimed.

Maaatisha said nothing. She was getting used to the heartless bitch.

“This was clearly the work of Kate. It’s nice to see Kate do so well.”

“Soulless monster,” the doctor muttered as he attended to Vikkart.

“Of course I’m soulless,” Kate replied, “I’m an AI. But, yeah, don’t take the headset off. We are doing a controlled shut down, and Maaatisha is in there, or should be,” she added while looking at Maaatisha meaningfully, “holding Vik’s hand and...”

She smirked at Vikkart’s growing erection.

“and otherwise comforting him.”

“Obscene,” the doctor muttered as he prepared an injection. “And I do *not* mean the impending ejaculation. The *humans* actually use these abominations?”

“Not for about six hundred years,” Kate cheerfully replied, “Shit like this kept happening. They were only on the market for around ten years or so. Killed a *lot* of people.”

“Where did that fiend get this nightmare, then?”

“From Kate!” Kate enthused, “Satisfaction guaranteed! Whatever you want, no matter how big or how small, we got it! And if we don’t...”

Kate smiled a perfectly innocent and warm smile.

“We’ll make it!”

We get there, plenty people seated and waiting so we felt confident about the service. Instead, we waited over an hour (close to closing time by the time we left) with no sign of our food and seeing other tables up and leave as well. Our server didn't tell us till we wanted our bill for the coffees that something was up with the kitchen staff, but if that was the case why didn't she say anything when we came in? 

The other thing is that, I don't blame the staff for this embarrassment, management should have been on top of this. If staff wasn't fully ready to go then they should not have opened, but how did two days ago somehow they did better than today? It's Boxing Day, it's gonna be busy, but kitchen really felt like it was one person back there doing one order at a time whenever they felt like it, not an entire team that just didn't know what to do. 

 I really hope that this isn't going to be consistent, as me and my partner really wanted to give IHop a chance, but today's experience left me disappointed and embarrassed. I don't think I'll be back unless the owner gives us some compensation, like our meal we ordered today (that we never got) free and a discount on the next order. 

 If anyone else went, leave a review on Google and really point out that management failed today.

1hmy84b,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1hmy84b/skinny_mil_is_fatphobic/,Skinny MIL is Fatphobic,"To preface, my MIL is Asian and has always been very skinny (under 100lbs). 
I have always been just a little bit chubby, but never unhealthy. I take care of myself and I like to eat “healthy” food as well as the occasional unhealthy food, I think I’m pretty normal. When I met her, she made subtly comments about my weight- how I needed to “make sure I eat veggies” “watch my calories”. I’m also Asian so this isn’t new to me, my distant family made comments before but only when I was a child. 
Anyways, I finally broke down one day when I was with my bf’s family and we all got coffee. I ordered a coffee that had whipped cream on it and when they brought it out she said VERY loudly to everyone, “Oh! Make sure you watch your calories! How huge!”. It took everything in me to not start crying in public, but as soon as I got home I did. That’s when my boyfriend decided to finally say something- she finally crossed the line. And he really did stand up for me and continues to. She texted me an apology and I felt it was genuine…
Fast forward about 7 months later, no more weight comments (to my face). But she did try to make me try on her old clothes in front of her “to give to me”. They’re XXS. I’m a medium at best so imagine the humiliation when I had to “try” them on in front of her and they wouldn’t even fit over my shoulders. 

Anyway..  I know she has good intentions, and she cares about me, but sometimes I think about these instances and the way she thinks about weight and it really bothers me. 

She posts her flat stomach online all the time and associates being skinny with healthy. Ngl it kinda makes me feel like shit.

The brands that have made it to my routine is 

NUUD Pleasures. 
Aphrodisiac vapes with HHC:  they get you high and horny and I love that I can take them anywhere with me. I have been using these weekly for like a year now. I take them to clubs and parties and everyone loves to try them and they are great conversation starters and have gotten me laid too many times to count. 

Aphrodisiac Sex gummies: These get you super high so I suggest starting with a half but these are when you want to have mindblowing sex where the entire world just melts away and it's just you and your partner. I reserve these usually for long time partners as these are intense. Seriously life changing. (I also take these on hikes or for traveling around new cities as it just a fun time in general) 
  
Vitality Gummies and pills with natural ingredients that leave me rock hard and horny for like 3 days, I take these as pick me ups for weekends or times i know im going to be having a ton of sex. (They gave me these once for free when I ordered a vape and i was like wow this works.

Studio ready.
Coffee but scrub: I love the feeling of the but scrub as it makes me feel confident but I also love eating out an ass that has been cleaned by these. 5 stars I definitely recommend.

Uberlube.
Uber  lube: Their lube is heads down my favorite one. It comes in an awesome glass bottle, is super silky and smooth, has no smell and a small amount goes a long way. I can't use anything else anymore.

First I was told it’ll take about a year. All of the sheriffs and investigators in the office are part time. There’s only ONE chief who then must approve all applications. Then the administration must approve all. Then it goes to the courts where there is no judge assigned to pistol permits so he must individually go through each one on his/her time off, lunch breaks, recess. That alone should be illegal. The reference portion is ridiculous. I was told I must carefully remove each staple from the top, if the corners get ripped, damaged in any way it will not be accepted. No tears, stains nothing. Every single page must remain 100% brand new. So if my neighbor is my reference and happens to get a small coffee stain, if he’s a mechanic and gets small oil fingerprint on it I’m disqualified? I was arrested at 16, I now have to go the courts unseal my records and get all paperwork on that arrest within 90 days. I was adjudicated youthful offender and now they said I have to see a judge, get the paperwork made up and signed and mailed to me. I know for a fact they’re going to take longer than 90 days. This is all so discouraging and I don’t want to do it but I know that’s why they make the process so complicated. On a side note, my family moved to PA, go their full carry within 3 days.

(51M) I have not been diagnosed with ADHD - or yet, long waiting list to see a specialist so appointment only in April. I have had anxiety issues since late teens/ early 20s and been mainly on SSRIs on and off since (mostly on). After alcohol consumption spun out of control several years ago (always was a ""good"" social drinker until suddenly following some challenging times into an alcohol use disorder (was likely using at as a form of self-medication before it became a physical addiction). Went to rehab and have now been sober for 2.5 years which has helped with my anxiety and other stupidities (caught it in the nick of time), and only really then learnt that alcohol like caffeine (which I am actually struggling to quit, harder than alcohol conscious that it does me no good) makes anxiety way worse as the alcohol leaves the body...so why here - well I have always been a speedy personality, sensitive to caffeine, people pleaser, struggling to stay focused on one thing all that long, multi-tasking without actually finishing any of it, always a feeling of having to be doing something. Also impatient and often realize I am often not really listening to the person I am speaking to but thinking of things that need to get done, etc. So I brought this up with  my therapist and said, semi-jokingly, maybe I have ADHD and he said it was possible though difficult to diagnose. He suggested I test Concerta (I take 20mg of Lexapro), 18mg. First day some week before Christmas, I felt quite peaceful and productive, maybe placebo and sort of thinking I can now pin a name to my discomfort. After a few days I felt my jaw clenching a lot and a bit spaced out late afternoons, though less jumpy, more constructive conversations with near and dear, more patient. Then the day before Christmas I took it as usual in the morning 7am ish, but had a lot of anxiety (did have two lattes) quite rapidly and was uncomfortable driving my son and friends (to the extent I had to take some tranquilizers). So I quit for 2 days, and felt less tense and anxious but also more shifty and short-spoken. I started again today and felt calmer during the day (though again had several coffees, yes I  know probably not too smart, really should try getting off that). Towards late afternoon felt again more spaced out not really anxious but a bit floaty/ dizzy (and yes dry mouth). Do some people take Concerta without having an ADHD diagnosis? Any advise would be welcome re: the side effects, if I should keep trying it or not, etc. I did take Wellbutrin for 8 months when my therapist at the time felt I needed a boost post sobering-up but I was totally wired on it, crashing end of day, tinnitus, insomnia, extreme muscle tension.....Concerta seems to be less aggressive....Thanks for any thoughts.

I have had a pretty smooth pregnancy at 24 weeks, I stayed very active for the first trimester and started cooling things down in my second. But these last few weeks have been so, so uncomfortable. 


I've been burping/throwing up stomach acid near daily, my stomach feels like a hot coal in my chest. I can't talk for extended periods without gas buildup causing discomfort and burping/vomiting. So far I've tried tums, gas-x, pepcid, nothing has helped. It's made so much worse from prolonged sitting, so I'm dreading driving to work in traffic after the holiday break. It comes with awful bloating and indigestion as well, which made me think that it might be a stomach ulcer.


When I went to see my primary care doc this morning (not my Midwife), I felt just so stuck. She lectured me about healthy eating and said that I need to stop eating chocolate/coffee/fried/fatty foods and stop drinking fruit juice. What really made me angry is that I already don't eat any of that stuff! She said she wouldn't test me for an ulcer and even if I had one, she wouldn't do anything because I'm pregnant. She gave me omepratzole and suggested that with lifestyle changes could fix it. I'm hoping that the PPI will help things, but I'm also looking at everything that exacerbates GERD and trying to fully cut it out.


Has anyone else experienced acid reflux/GERD during their pregnancy, and what did your diet look like when you changed things? I just feel so frustrated and nervous about this acid reflux. My weight gain has also made my feelings about all of this worse (I started at 115lbs and am currently at 137lbs), even though no one has made negative comments. I just feel already so huge and IDK what to do for the next half of this pregnancy if things are just (as my doctor said this morning) going to get worse. :(

I’m an avid coffee drinker (minimum 3-4 cups a day) if that makes a difference or not. Doing it alone as I have no known associates who drink mate so, as always, Reddit to the rescue. 

I have a couple of questions:
1. I don’t understand what the deal is with “curando” of the cups. I mean some sites just say wash and clean normal but others fear mold or that you have to prepare the cup. Seems confusingly complicated or it may just be me. I’m still understanding the importance of the cups FYI so a little patience 😂. 

2. So I pour my yerba and my water. When do I refill the water and how many “pours” does the yerba stay until I pour a new batch. I’m not clear on the basics of the everyday drinking. Also how does one drink the cup, like while it’s hot etc. 

3. Is the portable hot water necessary? I’m planning on drinking it in my house for now. I was planning on using a kettle for the water but I feel you avid drinkers wouldn’t approve 😂. 

4. I am buying a beginner kit from a local company and there are some differences I’m not sure what is required and what isn’t. There are taller and curvy cups (steel) and there are round and fatty cups with (steel with leather on the outside). Does it matter which or is it just which is prettier looking?

I’m a bit lost and will probably have more questions as I go. But don’t have any experience or any associates so all help is appreciated. Also be patient with my ignorance.

This past fall I got into a prestigious business club and the guy (20M) is on E-Board and was assigned as my mentor for the semester. I first met him when I attended an info session and I was impressed with how well-spoken and kind he was. He’s handsome, tall, fit, on a sports team and he’s extremely smart and friendly, all qualities I find very attractive which is interesting since I rarely feel attracted to much people. There were a few moments between us that I think were flirty and when our club went on a retreat (he sadly was sick and didn’t attend), some drunk people including someone also on E-Board said we were both the it people and that we would look really cute together. 

While I found it all flattering, I kept things strictly professional and didn’t pursue anything. Plus I’ve never been in a relationship, I don’t have much experience with guys and I’m not used to initiating so nothing really happened. But I suppose another setback is I ended up quitting the club halfway through the semester due to mental health and other personal issues that made it hard to continue. I did have to confront him about dropping which was hard but he was very understanding. 

I didn’t talk to him for a while after, but to still show support for everyone in the club, I attended their last business show which was open to the public. I saw him there and we chatted and he was extremely kind, asked me questions and he even admitted to me that he wished I could know him more outside of the club since he’s usually more friendly and less strict. I said I’d love to get coffee with him again sometime and he agreed but because it was finals season I never followed up with him which I regret.

Now the problem is I’m studying abroad next semester so I wouldn’t see him until I return for the next fall semester in like 8 months. But I just saw on his LinkedIn that he secured a summer internship that might be in my home city so I was wondering if it would be weird if I sent him a text asking where the location of his internship was and that if he’s gonna be in my home city I could show him around, even introduce him to some coffee spots (since we both love coffee), and get to know him more outside of the club.

Maybe I’m overthinking but is it weird if I texted him like that out of the blue? Keep in mind our last texts was me telling him I was dropping the club. Plus I’m studying abroad soon so idk if it’s strange to still text him now or not. But then again I keep thinking about if I should do something or not since I feel like I lowkey fumbled and he’s def a catch. What do yall think?",0,1735246597.0,dating_advice,8,0.33,False
1hmxsbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1hmxsbe/im_embarrassed_how_cliche_this_is/,I’m embarrassed how cliche this is. ,"Reading other mom’s posts about how they are 100% responsible for Christmas is making me so embarrassed about how our Christmas went down.  It’s just so cliche.  Even to the point that I’m going to start out trying to defend him a little.

My STBX husband really has “gone through it” this year.  He got laid off, his mother died, his sister went into the hospital and no one told him because they were all involved in a dispute over his mother’s estate (which he was just trying to stay out of) and she passed away, which he found out from his sister’s lawyer!  So if people choose to be offended on my behalf, I really appreciate the support, but take that down about 30% because he really is having a hard time.  He also mentioned on Christmas Eve that he had really “dropped the ball” and appreciated the fact I had picked it up and that  Christmas happened at all was 95% due to my efforts.

Also, this is not the reason he is my STBX, and I have not made him aware of this yet, so I don’t think this was intentionally passive aggressive.

About 10 years ago we decided we were a little tired of just getting just the clay ashtray or macaroni neckless from our kids, so we agreed to help our kids pick out presents for the other and pay for 1/2.  (They had generous allowances and now have part time jobs.)

Enough background ON TO CHRISTMAS day…

“We” got my husband 2 of the “grown up” signature edition Star Wars Lego sets, and “top of the line” AirPods.  I got him a big bottle of Johnny Walker Black label and about $150 of high quality weed.  (I gave the weed to him in private because it not 100% legal here, and it took quite an effort to get it.)

“They” got me 1 lb of coffee from Costco (I haven’t drank coffee at home in about 5 years, but he does almost every day.) A coffee mug with a passive aggressive joke on it.  (The kid MIGHT not have “gotten” the joke, but he certainly did.) 

And he got me 3 pairs of cheap earbuds.  (I do lose my earbuds, a lot.)  2 pairs of which need an adapter to charge them that 
I do not now, nor have ever had.  And he works in IT, so if he’d even bothered to look at box he’d know that.  

I know he’s going through it and maybe should have lowered my expectations this year.  But we usually try to outdo each other and “win” Christmas (which is usually pretty fun for both of us, or so I thought.) 

I guess I am just venting as he was a STBX even before he went through all this stuff with his family.

1hmxrcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/askdentists/comments/1hmxrcg/tartar_loss_questions/,Tartar Loss [Questions],"Hey Y’all. 

I’m trying to put myself at ease until an appointment Tomorrow. Back in September I had what I thought was a tooth crack form horizontally on the backs of one of my bottom front teeth. I went to the dentist and found out I have a large amount of Tartar build-up, he gently nudged off the piece at the visit. 

My insurance won’t cover scaling, so I’ve been waiting to have it done until I can afford it. I’ve general anxiety going to the dentist, the whole situation is an anxious nightmare for me. I take care of my teeth now, but didn’t when I was younger (23 now) and it had a serious impact. 

Anyway, on Christmas Eve I had another horizontal crack form close to the line of discoloration where the Tartar visibly begins. I forced myself not to panic and made it through the holiday; Thankfully it didn’t come out until this Morning. No pain, bleeding, and my tooth doesn’t feel loose — so I’m almost certain it’s Tartar. However, it was much larger than I anticipated and there’s large amounts of build-up around the other teeth next to it. The tooth that had the Tartar break-off like I said seems stable, and it’s white underneath. But feels like there’s some pressure on what’s clearly excess Tartar built up on a tooth next to it. The chunk lost essentially ran from the top of my tooth to the gumline, and am in the same situation with the other. For context, I’ve had the buildup so long that the last time I genuinely thought that I lost a tooth chunk and lived my late teenage years thinking it was just my teeth. Understood why the backs of the front of my teeth frequently get “dry” after that as well…

**My actual question though, I’m rambling:** 

**Should I be worried about the stability of my teeth? Is it okay and should I expect the chunk on the other tooth next to it to come off?**

**And secondary question.** *Since I realized my teeth needed work I’ve avoided coffee. Both times I have had a crack form now was a day after I’d a rare cup of hot coffee (iced has never really bothered my teeth) — Is there some science to why coffee seems to be making it break? I had stopped drinking it initially because it always made the ‘backs of my teeth’ (which I now am aware was Tartar) dry. I’m curious of thoughts from professionals. It’s a very odd coincidence*

I can’t get my mind off of my teeth 😅. So I’d appreciate any reassurance or advice. I made an appointment with my general dentist (where I *am* medically covered for an emergency visit) for Tomorrow. Thanks for any answers in advance 🙏🏼. ",1,1735246452.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1hmxp91,https://www.reddit.com/r/moosejaw/comments/1hmxp91/looking_for_friends/,Looking for friends :) ,"So my boyfriend has moved back here since living out of this city for many years about 2 years ago. He is from here. I am originally from Regina but moved in with him this last the summer. Aside from his family we don't really know a ton of people here. We are both quite home bodies, and struggle to meet new people. He works from home and I commute to Regina daily for work, so having co-workers come over is an option. We also don't drink. 

Essentially just seeing if there is anyone out there who is ideally a couple (doesn't have to be though!) who would be interested in hanging out! We were thinking of maybe if we can get a couple like minded folk to hang out once a week or so to play board games. Public places, like coffee shops or whatever allows that! We are interested in learning stuff like D&D, Magic of the gathering, or any other games that can be resumed weekly.

Here is some info about us to see if we would be a good match! 

-Late 20's + early 30's 

-Music lovers (punk rock, post punk, prog, new wave, metal)

-cat people (we love all animals though) 

-star wars nerd (he is- I'm more of an LOTR person)

-audiophile, physical media collectors

-horror movie fans

-not terribly politically inclined (I'd say leaning left of center?) prefer not to get involved mostly 

-enjoy gardening (summer time) 

-thrifting, refurbishing, vintage collectors (we love OLD stuff) 

-sushi @ mitsu

-we are not religious (we don't mind if you are! As long as you don't try to convert us) 

-going on walks and bike rides around the city in the summer

-love to make homemade meals and baking from scratch

-like reading, mysteries, true crime, etc!

-some video games (love TW3 and other fantasy stuff)

I (M37) posted here a short while ago about looking for guy friends. I had some good interest in it, so just posting again in case any guys on here missed it and would be interested in hanging out.

I’m organising for a group of us to meet up this Saturday evening in Downtown Vancouver at a quiet bar with a nice atmosphere. If you’re interested you can DM me and tell me a bit about yourself.

I got some DMs from some of you and some comments on the previous post which I’ll respond to today.

A bit about me, I’m 37, been living in Vancouver for over six years. Made some really close friends through this sub, who are mostly girls and who I see a lot but would like some guy friends too as I miss the boy banter. My best friend moved back to his country three years ago, and I did have some other guys friend in the last few years, but the friendships didn’t work out. (It was a mix between them moving away, or just turning out to be not good people).

I’m a gym guy, I go six days a week - I started going to Evolve recently and it’s a great one. I go at 5am (sometimes again at night for cardio). Love horror movies and K-dramas. Big into coffee, love food & desserts. Baking and cookings are big passions of mine too.

Happy to have you along on Saturday evening if you’re free. If you’re reading this post at a later stage, DM me and will tell you about future hangouts. 😃",5,1735246113.0,Vancouver4Friends,2,1.0,False

Often by having an FEIN or business name you can get much better pricing on items. We buy from hardware and kitchen fixture vendors for example and letting employees into that could be a perk. I could also sign up with a wholesale coffee place and allow employees access to purchase coffee on their own dime but at our prices. 

We are small and it’s tough to offer many perks beyond the basics like 401k, even health insurance isn’t viable for us yet. We’ve done the occasional favor but doing that and being able to advertise it as a perk with regular engagement is a different level. 

I’d think managing it could take a little work but we have a purchasing manager to keep tabs on employees paying, generating sales orders, etc. The biggest hurdle is probably access but I’d think price lists and website availability makes that manageable and not impossible.

Perks like this aren’t equally valuable to everyone but between our existing vendors and being able to sign up with new ones I’d hope to find at least one vendor or product that at least one employee would value having access to. ",0,1735245942.0,smallbusiness,3,0.33,False

1hmxey7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hmxey7/im_starting_to_dislike_my_grandma/,I'm starting to dislike my grandma.,"I know it sounds harsh but over the last few years my grandma turned from a sweet and loving (all be it a bit hot headed) into a bitter, salty old lady. I know shes been through alot, and I do feel really bad for her but she is becoming so incredibly negative and mean to a point where i dont want to visit anymore. 

All the times i do visit for coffee all she really talks about is how no one comes to visit, while also trash talking them, me, my partner and basicly everything. She will also lie and tell me no one visits her, just to hear she visits other people, and has visitors over basicly every day. 

She also called my brother a thief, and has been trying to pit us against each other by obviously having favorites, but also trash talking about us.My brother is not a thief, he has a good job and is a very honest person. They went to an all you can eat restaurant where you still had to pay for alcoholic beverages, where my grandma refused to have him pay for a drink and shoved her bank card into his hands. A day after she called him, saying he stole money from him and kept bringing it up, or giving him less money on his birthday because ""he already stole some"".  In the same week she accidently transferred me 2500, told me to keep it? And then later decided i got to keep 100 but made me promise not to tell anyone. This made me feel really bad. I tried to refuse it, i really did but i also didnt want to start more drama, to this day it still feels wrong even if i needed it at the time. 

She got really demanding and ungrateful, never saying please or thank you, or even an 'how are you' its literally only ""Do this for me."" But when you do its never good enough, and somehow she always expects you want to be paid, even if its for a mundane task. She tried to pay me for looking up a song for her and even if i do appreciate it it still feels wrong and like i shouldnt. Like she thinks the money will make me want to come visit more. 

She also makes it a point to bring someone else down, when trying to compliment you, constantly comparing you to someone else to somehow make you feel better? For example ""Youve gotten so skinny, unlike your mom:)"" It just gives me the ick. 

The thing that bothers me the most is how she treats my mom. I think its the main reason its so frustrating to me, shes relatevily nice to me but god the way she speaks to my mom makes me want to scream. My mom does EVERYTHING for her even if she can do it herself. Groceries, going with her to apointments, shopping in general, visiting, etc. Never a thank you. Never a 'please'. But constantly undermining everything she does while praising my dad into the heavens for the bare minimum (no offense to my dad hes a great guy just caught in the mess) its just so infuriating. 

My patience is running thing. I cant really pretend to not be fed up anymore, and usually i would ignore her comments and behaviour but i cant anymore. I know she noticed, she told my brother i used to be so sweet. Im just tired of being texted an ""are you mad at me?"" every few days, or getting a heart attack because i woke up to 6 missed calls at 4 am from her (she was fine. she forgot her password for instagram)

1hmxdf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1hmxdf8/spouse_concerning_sleep_event/,Spouse Concerning Sleep Event,"TL;DR: boyfriend went into zombie-like possessed state last night and has zero memory of it this morning, should we seek medical analysis? 

My bf (m29 Caucasian 71” 175lbs) and I (m28 Hispanic/Caucasian 71” 175lbs) have been dating for nearly 18 months. We are currently staying in an Airbnb for a week-long Christmas getaway in Colorado and last night there was a concerning incident I figured would be worth posting/inquiring about.

Background: We normally spend the night at each other’s houses a few nights each week and I’ve noticed he occasionally talks in his sleep (I’d say I observe this ~ 1x time per month). Typically he mumbles gibberish, nothing aggressive. The second night of our stay here at the cabin, he put his foot on my leg while we were sleeping (he has exceptional control/articulation of his toes) and ripped out my leg hair. I woke up and was upset with him and he ignored me (the next morning he had zero memory of this when I asked him about it).

Last night, after having eaten a heavy Christmas dinner and a moderate amount of alcohol consumption (definitely nothing heavy or out of the normal), we watched a few movies back-to-back. He fell asleep around 11:30 pm and the movie ended around midnight. I gently rubbed his back to wake him up to go to bed upstairs from the couch downstairs. After maybe 10-15 seconds of gently trying to rub his back to wake him up, I started to gently jostle him awake. He popped up in somewhat of a panic and stared at me quite blankly. I let him know it was time to get to bed and we needed to go upstairs. He started mumbling something then pulled me down onto the couch and started repeating something chant-like into my ear somewhat aggressively. I wasn’t able to discern the language, but it wasn’t English. I speak fluent English and Spanish and am generally able to identify most languages. He only speaks English. I got up and repeatedly asked what he was saying only to be met with a blank stare. 

I kept asking him to go upstairs and he kept grunting or simply saying “no” each time I asked. I turned on the lights to try and encourage him to wake up. He got up off the couch, grabbed his laptop and started heading upstairs. I repeatedly asked why he was taking his laptop upstairs (this isn’t normal behavior) and he told me he needed it. He then made it upstairs and went to the restroom while I got in bed. He exited the restroom and seemed to mindlessly wander around until he found this locked closet at the top of the stairs (I assume the Airbnb host keeps extra supplies or something in there and it’s been locked and inaccessible since we arrived). He tried for maybe 20 seconds to turn the door knob and then finally came to the bed. He jumped on top of me and hit my knee to which I told him that hurt. I then scolded him and said that hurt and that he had been acting very strange only to be met with a blank stare.

From that point, we went to sleep. He woke up twice and went downstairs each time. I hardly slept throughout the night due to the fear of what had come over him. I felt as if I was sleeping next to a complete stranger and was afraid he’d come upstairs with a kitchen knife or something terrible. 

This morning, I got out of bed and showered before he woke up. I came downstairs and started to clean up the kitchen and make some coffee. After about 45 minutes, he came downstairs I asked him to walk me through his recollection from the final movie we watched until present. He has zero memory or anything from nodding-off during the final movie until waking up and going downstairs twice (first was to get his phone, second was to get some tums, but he does remember each of these trips). I shared with him each detail and he was very surprised and apologetic, but genuinely didn’t remember any of what had happened. I told him I didn’t feel safe around him while he was in this state, like he was a complete stranger in this zombie-like possessed state (neither of us are religious and I don’t believe in paranormal/superstitious things). 

This behavior is really unlike him, he’s a very sweet and quiet guy. I’m concerned and don’t know what to do, should he seek medical intervention/diagnosis? ",2,1735245379.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

1hmxbp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1hmxbp6/figured_out_the_secret_of_happiness_but_still/,"Figured out the secret of happiness, but still unhappy ","I bro-studied brain chemicals, stoicism, evolutionary psychology and cognitive behavior therapy. 

Was able to create a simple checklist of 10 things that together basically guarantee happiness in days. It works every time I follow it. 

However, now I’m still unhappy mainly because I can’t make myself do them. It’s like I WANT to be a miserable man child and feel sorry for myself. So silly


Edit: Rough List

- Sleep 8h the same time every day. Wake up 4h before you should with no alarm. Now you have ”me-time” when you are the most energetic. Time is just a construct. ”Early” is late in another time zone. It’s all about the sircadian rytm

- If you dont disturb the peace, you shall have peace. Meaning, ignore the phone/tv/laptop the first hours. Journal to get your brain empty. Use the peace to drink coffee in bed and think of three things of gratitude. 

- Do fasting/OMAD/keto etc. Eating will cause tour blood sugar to crash leading to fatigue. By eating 3-4 times a day you crash 3-4 times a day. Eating once or no carbs will give you more energy by the way of stable blood sugar

- Feeling bored or anxious can just be slight dehydration or missing tryptophan. Add salt to water and drink a big glass to make sure. Being bored or sad (not depression) are just warning signals like hunger. If a caveman was not bored he wouldn’t venture out and just die in the cave. Avoid false dopamin like social media or talking to an ai or friend, that puts our brain into analytical mode. We want to be freeflowing. If you are bored, that is your brain saying ”you should do something or you may perish”. So do something. Anything. 

- Only browse social media etc for like 5 min a day. Save it for a rest room break where you have a clear stop signal as the apps are designed to keep you scrolling without one. It will feel like a reward. Once you go that low it will also start feeling uninteresting. If it feels hard, ask yourself if you can remember a single good post during your last scrolling session. 

- The brain has two mode, we want to be in the default mode, the flow. Where time disappears. It happens where challenge meets curiosity. Not to hard. Not too easy. Music can put us in that mode. So can painting and so on. Walking works too. 

- Bed is for sleeping only. Move locations often. Our brain uses our memory to check if we are happy. If all it remembers is lounging in bed the day seems to be very short. The more ”locations” you are in, the more fulfilling the day will seem. Go for walks. Sit in different places in your house. You’ll trick your brain you did a ton. 

- Clean and Do three tasks per day. You think of it as preparing not doing. The task can be small. Cleaning is like supercharged as it ties into evolutionary instincts, nice smell and visually pleasing. I do 5 min cleaning per day. Do not try to get ”done”, but to prepare. Like, doing the laundry may feel terrible, but preparing to do laundry feels good. So get the basket, check the cloathes, book the machine. Voila, the task seem easy and you feel proud. 


- Body language mimic mood and opposite. Fake a posture and smirk and you will feel better. Go outside and instead of looking at the ground look at rooftops/clouds/treetops. Changes mood instantly. Fresh air and breaking your headspace bubble is a bonus too. 

- Less is more. To be happy we must feel happy. Close your eyes and imagine the feeling of slipping into a jacuzzi, having the first beer on a tropical beach, sitting down after a long run. Can you feel that? Ofc you can. It’s due to our brain not knowing the difference between reality and fiction. You are basically triggering you mirror neurons by mirroring your pretend scenario. Thus, you now can feel ”happy” on command. 


Theres a lot to it ofc. A small peek above. To sum it up with a now on top. 
Happiness does not exists. Only contentment. Being free from problems. We get used to anything (hedonic threadmill), which means the best bet is to get used to less not more. Protect your peace. Don’t let problems into your life. Get out of analytical mode. Trick your brain with good stimulus. I could go on. When in doubt, think how a bad feeling you have would have been evolutionary beneficial. 

Oh and lastly. Stop drinking, forgive yourself, never compare, be kind but have principles.",2,1735245249.0,selfimprovement,23,0.6,False

1hmxala,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hmxala/aitah_for_not_wanting_my_sisters_boyfriend_to_be/,AITAH for not wanting my sister's boyfriend to be affectionate with my kid? ,"
I'm going to preface this by saying that I have a history of CSA and am very protective of my son as a result. No further mention of SA in this post. 

My sister has a newer boyfriend - they've officially been together for 7 months. She got pregnant before they became official so things in their relationship have obviously been moving fast.
He seems OK and she's really happy, but I hardly know him. Whenever I see him he makes very little effort to interact with me and shuts down most conversation attempts with dead end or sarcastic responses, but loves my son. My sister used to babysit him for a few hours once a week and the bf was there sometimes so he's had an opportunity to ""bond"" with my son without me there.
A few months ago my husband and I both started feeling a little weird about the fact that when we saw him he wouldn't really say hi to us, he would just greet our son and start interacting with him. Then one day we went to coffee and the bf sat in the back with my son and was draping himself over my sons car seat playing with him and pinching his toes. I felt weird about it but thought it could just be a sensitivity from my childhood.

This kind of stuff (only interacting with my son, tickling him, leaning up against him when they were sitting on the floor playing) continued so we stopped having my sister watch him not liking the idea of him interacting with our son without our supervision.
He also messes with him in a way that feels mean spirited to me - ex; holding onto his little foot powered car so he couldn't move it until I intervened when my son got frustrated, putting on his hood when he doesn't like it, little things that aren't bad enough for me to be firm with him but don't sit well with me.
We were trying to put a stop to it without having a big talk because we don't want to upset my sister, but things came to a bit of a head the other night. We went to look at Christmas lights and he started to mess with my sons hood (again) while my sister was holding him. I said quite loudly that he doesn't want his hood on, but the boyfriend proceeded to try to put it on him - despite what I said and my son obviously not liking it. My husband was standing close by and swatted the boyfriends hand away. It was tense after that but nobody brought it up.
A day or two later my husband brought it up to my sister, apologized and explained his reaction. My sister acted like they didn't hear me say anything (even though at the time she looked at me and said ""oh really?"") and said that boyfriend is an extremely sweet person and would never intentionally do anything to bother our son. She expressed how uncomfortable my husband's behavior made her and said she wants us to communicate with kind words going forward so boyfriend doesn't feel like he can't interact or help with our son.
At this point we feel she's placing all the blame on us but decide to just try to get to know the guy better so we feel more comfortable about him interacting with our son.
We do a little outing with them Christmas eve day which went to well, and then have a family gathering at our house that night. 
I'm reading books with our son on the couch and the boyfriend is sitting next to me. He starts massaging my sons feet and I  instantly feel uncomfortable. I have no idea how to set boundaries so I jokingly put my foot in front of my sons and say ""my turn?"" thinking he'll get the hint. Nope, starts massaging them again once I move my foot!
I picked up my son and switch him to my other side so he couldn't keep doing it, but could not think of a single thing to say that wouldn't have blown up into a big thing.

My husband and I had a conversation afterwards and he said that we need to just set a boundary thay boyfriend can't be affectionate with our kid. I agree, but it feels outrageous to sit someone down and say ""listen, I know you're going to be in my family for the rest of our lives but I don't want you to be affectionate with my son."" 
Are we being unreasonable? Please let me know if I'm the asshole here or if you would feel the same. 

TLDR: Am I the AH for not wanting my sister's boyfriend to be affectionate with my son when I don't know him very well and he doesn't make an effort to interact with me and my husband?

1hmx988,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHermesGame/comments/1hmx988/hermes_book_club_hermes_the_fashion_icon_by/,Hermes Book Club: Hermes the Fashion Icon by Alison James,"I purchased a ton of books on handbag history for the new year, including 'Hermes: The fashion icons' by Allison James (Fall 2024). Yes, it's another unofficial and unauthorized biography, but it's a great coffee table read.
It doesn't offer anything new regarding Hermes history, but, I absolutely love the formatting, the product close-ups, the store shots and ads. 

It includes a mini section on how to purchase reputable scarves (check out the hems, image print style, the writing/names that might appear and the standard scarf size). Most books include an Hermes stats section, but the formatting in this one rocked.

As an African-American, I love when authors identify celebrities of all backgrounds as Hermes fans, without derision. I forgot that Sammy Davis Jr had commissioned a portable drinks bag from Hermes. I also forgot that Hermes was the store that blocked Oprah in Paris. The writer did a good job of conveying that Dumas had gently stepped back at that time, when ordinarily he would have met Winfrey. She also pointed out that the store was open past standard hours, due to preparation for a fashion show, which is why Winfrey didn't understand why they weren't allowing her to enter. I didn't realize the Hermes USA CEO later went on Winfrey's show to apologize. She also lists Jamie Chua's 200 birkins above Posh's 100-something (some of the books I've read typically mention Posh but always omit Chua).

I also loved the mini history of how Gaultier adjusted the handles and width of Birkin and Kelly bags. This also featured a huge focus on ready to wear, which other books typically overlook.

Almost all of the unofficial Hermes books I've read are great, including the little orange book, but this is definitely a great contribution to anyone's Hermes library ;)",5,1735245059.0,TheHermesGame,2,0.86,False

1hmx743,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1hmx743/9_years_later_a_marriage_and_a_daughter_a_part_of/,"9 years later, a marriage and a daughter, a part of me is still with her. And it will always be with her.(I have to repost from another account cause i was getting notifications on my phone :) )","I hope you're all well. This is my story. I just want to get it off my chest before everything collapses inside of me.  
This story took place on the harshly beautiful island of Folegandros. I was a chef at a small hotel. She was the daughter of the manager and a waitress at the restaurant of the hotel.

I'm 31 years old. Ten years ago, I had my first relationship. Kind of late to the party, I guess.  
We met at work. She was the daughter of the manager. At the time, she was 18, and I was 21 (it is legal in my country, Greece). We were working together, and she made something click inside of me, I guess.  
I'm a shy guy, kind of close to myself, and never really made a move on her. One day at work, something fell into my arm and kind of broke my pinky finger. I worked through it, but once the service was done, I went to a private place because I couldn't handle the pain anymore and didn't want to show the rest of the staff that I was in so much pain.  
She looked for me and brought me ice. That was the first time I talked to her a bit more outside of the usual friendly chat between coworkers. She caressed my hand and told me I needed a doctor. I said I was fine and told her not to worry. She stayed with me for 10-15 minutes, and after, we had to go back to work.  
All this time, she was pressing my hand with the ice. I felt great emotionally.  
For the first time, I was in love.

After a few days, I got the courage and messaged her on Facebook at 2 o'clock in the night:

""what are you doing awake at this hour?""  
She replied:  
HER: ""I just got out of the shower, what about you?""  
ME: ""I was thinking that I never said thank you for the other night.""  
HER: ""Well, better late than never."" (It's something we say in Greece.)  
ME: ""Want to go for a coffee in the morning?""  
HER: ""I have to be at the reception desk in the morning, but I'm free at night after the restaurant closes.""  
ME: ""So, wanna go for a drink to 'xxxxxx'?""  
HER: ""Of course.""  
We chatted a bit more through messages and eventually said goodnight to one another.  
The next day, I saw her at her desk as I was going to the restaurant to prepare breakfast for the hotel guests. We both had an idiotic smile on our faces.  
The hours passed really fast, and eventually, we finished work. At 11 o'clock at night, we were both in our rooms getting ready. I still remember how anxious I was, even though this was supposed to be just friends having drinks.  
We arrived at the bar, and I remember that she sat first on one side of the couch, and I sat on the other side, far away. About three more people could fit between us to sit. I was afraid. We had two cocktails, and two more after that, chatted a lot, and after some time, she told me to come and sit near her while laughing at the fact that I was so far away. After a few minutes, my heart was pumping so hard and fast. I eventually got the courage to touch her hand, and once I did, she shouted ""FINALLY,"" smiled at me sweetly, and we kissed.  
I will skip the part of our relationship. Things were great for both of us.  
Nine months later, difficult circumstances on both our sides made things extremely tough on us. My dad had cancer, and she had to study for university. We had no time for each other. Eventually, we ended the relationship. I was devastated. But I found joy in knowing that now she would have time to succeed in her life.  
Anyway, as time went by, her image and her aura, let's say, never left my head, but I was dealing with it somewhat with help from a close friend of mine.  
But EVERY DAY was a struggle emotionally.

We met again 5 years later. I was with another girl, and she was with another man. I was working at the same place, and she came for work as well. I knew she would eventually come, and I was confident that I would be cool with it.  
The moment I saw her, my insides became lava. My eyes teared up, and I had a burning sensation to just hug her as hard as I could. It wasn’t something sexual. I just wanted to feel her in my arms again. Anyway, we chatted a bit and went on our way.  
After a few days of working with her and my girlfriend at the time (she is my wife now) at the same place, I became a bit more relaxed, and things were well. One night, all the staff decided to go for drinks. So, about 15 people, we went to a bar and had some nice drinks. At one point, I got a bit emotional and wanted to leave. I said goodnight to everyone and left the place. My mind was so out of place, I didn’t kiss my girlfriend goodnight.  
My girlfriend (we were together for about a month at the time) came to my place afterward. She was sad, but eventually, we talked it through. I said I was sorry, explained to her what was happening, and she just hugged me and said, ""It's okay.""  
A few days later, I needed a lift to work, and the only one with a car was my ex. She told me to get breakfast before leaving to catch up. I told this to my girlfriend, and she said, ""As long as you trust yourself to not betray me, go ahead.""  
We went for breakfast at a cute place and had a chat. We discussed why we ended the relationship. She told me that she was sorry and regretted it. She told me that if I came back to the island the next year, she would still want to get together with me again. She told me that if we weren't in a relationship right now, she would hop into my hug the moment she saw me.  
I can't describe what I felt at the time. I was happy and sad.  
Days, weeks, and months passed, and the summer season ended. We parted ways.

Fast forward, 5 years later, my girlfriend is now my wife, and we just had our newborn daughter. She is one month old. I love them both.

About one week ago, I saw her(my ex) in my dreams. She was crying a lot and looking at me with her hand towards me as if she was trying to reach me. I was trying to run to her but the more I ran, the further away she was getting. I woke up in a sweat and trembling. Ever since that day, I’ve had the same dream almost every night. I have this burning desire now to message her and ask, ""How are you, etc.?"" but I haven't done it. And i wont do it

Four days ago, I saw her on an Instagram story holding a gift from one of her friends, saying ""MAMA"" or in other words, ""MOM."" She is pregnant. I'm happy for her. Honestly, I want all the best for her and all her family. I wanted to message her to congratulate her, but I didn’t do it. I thought it would be weird.

I feel as if no matter what I do in my life, a big part of me will always be with her, for her and i dont know how to move on.",5,1735244903.0,heartbreak,1,0.78,False

If you've tried or are on medication how has it helped you?,"I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child. They had me use a software called 'Robo Memo'. It essentially helped me with focus, memory etc by constantly testing me. I don't recall being on medication. 

Moving into elementary & high school I found it challenging to pay attention during class. Given how easy elementary & high school were I'd rather play League of Legends than study. My grades were always 'good enough' e.g. Bs & As. So I never paid much attention.

It wasn't until college that I was forced to face the fact that I still have ADHD. I remember it was specifically in my first quarter of nursing school. I was really having trouble keeping up with my piers because of the pure volume of material & lack of sleep. I'm sure my terrible working memory didn't help... I failed one of my clinical courses and had to retake it. I recall one of my professors telling me that I wasn't cut out to be a nurse... Which I'm sure came from a good place but really messed me up at the time. It was around this time that I started using Vyvanse which did wonders for my focus but the side effects messed me up. I wasn't eating, felt a mental state change (didn't feel like myself), dry lips, etc. After that I stopped taking my meds since the side effects were a bit much and started self-medicating with coffee.

I've been drinking coffee ever since. It's very helpful but not as impactful as medication for focus. In my professional life the focus issue + the fact that my job involves a lot of task switching really messes up my productivity. I feel like I'm getting by but I could be doing so much better! I feel the same way in my personal life. I could be doing so much better with better habits, discipline, & motivation.

**TLDR**: commercial Skyr in Canada is a scam. It's just yogurt and that's not what '*Those Who Went West*' deserve.

This is a method for making skyr popular with Icelandic families in Manitoba and likely Minnesota (lots of cross-border interaction) from the late '60s through the '80s. The recipe was shared via the network of Icelandic clubs and via notes in Christmas cards.

My  Amma used this method. She arrived in Manitoba as an 3 year old orphan from Iceland in 1900.

**Ingredients**:

2 litres of either 2% or homogenised milk (we preferred our Skyr made with homogenised milk but your mileage may vary)

1 litre of 3.5% buttermilk (look for one that has only Milk and Bacterial Cultures as the ingredients -no tapioca, guar, locust or stabilisers)

**Equipment:**

A quick-read thermometer or a 'laser' thermometer

A non-reactive pot large enough to hold 2 litres

A glass or stainless steel bowl large enough to hold 3 litres

Cheesecloth or an old pillow case (this is the authentic *Goolie* way)

Strong kitchen twine or Butcher's string

**Method:**

1. In a large non-reactive pot carefully heat the whole milk to 180 deg F, stirring occasionally to prevent the milk from scorching.  In the meantime, take the buttermilk from the fridge. It needs to be room temperature later on.
2. Carefully hold this temperature for 10 minutes. Unless your kitchen is very cold, turn off the heat under the milk asap it reaches 180F so it won't scorch.
3. Allow the milk to cool to 110 degrees. Any hotter and you risk killing the live culture room temperature. Go have a cup of kaffi, you've earned it.
4. Once the milk is cooled, shake the buttermilk and stir it into the cooled milk. Cover the pot and allow the skyr to incubate of at least 8 hours or up to 10 depending on how sour you like it.
5. Line a large bowl (3 litre capacity) with multiple layers of cheesecloth or the old pillowcase. Transfer the incubated skyr into the cloth / case and carefully gather up the corners, tying them together firmly with the kitchen twine.
6. Bring the bowl with the skyr to your sink and hang the soon-to-be skyr so it can drain. Continue to hang the skyr until it reaches the consistency you like best. You can collect the whey and use that to make Mysuostur or other dishes.
7. Refrigerate the skyr. It will keep for a long time providing your fridge is properly cold. Too many people waste food keeping their fridge too warm. You aren't saving money people, you are wasting far more resources than you realise and just making money for Roblaws.
8. Serve the skyr however you like but the real old-time way as practised by '*Those Who Went West*' is with sugar and cream. Fresh (fresh!) berries in season are also welcome.

**OK! Enjoy!** *My duty as a third generation Icelandic Canadian is done here.* Gleðileg jól!

**Bonus content:** 

*'****Those Who Went West****' describes a tragic period during the late 19th and early 20th century when a significant number of the Icelandic population had to leave due to famine. The State of Iceland considers this period a national tragedy and mourns the historic loss of so many citizens.*

*'****Kaffi****' Icelandic for coffee. Visit any Icelander and they will pour coffee for you almost as soon as you arrive! It's almost a ritual! The beans will be fresh and freshly ground. Your host will keep filling your cup even if you protest you only want ""another ten drops"".*

*'****Goolie****' There was once a skilled Icelander who was a powerful hockey goalie playing for Winnipeg. His name was hard to pronounce so the English speaking crowd would cheer ""Goalie!!!"" whenever he made a save. Many of the Icelandic fans didn't realise what was happening and so they also started shouting ""Goolie! Goolie!"" and thus -for a time- Icelanders in Manitoba were all given this historic monicker.* ",40,1735244676.0,loblawsisoutofcontrol,8,0.99,False

I wanted to start asap and get it going despite the not so great timing. I don't get nausea every day but I get like an aftertaste - I get some gum and it helps. I bought some ginger losenges. I didn't log my meals this weekend. Today I had Greek yogurt and 6 grapes for bkfst, along with coffee.  I could have waited to eat lunch, but I cook 5 days a week to feed people and we make enough to feed ourselves as well. I cooked lasagna and made a Caesar salad and garlic bread. I went ahead and decided to eat. Maybe this is what some of your experiences have been after a meal such as this, because cheese has fat. The dressing has fat but I used very little. I don't have a huge desire for sweets even though I'm around it. Yesterday there was food all around & I did indulge. I don't think I was much less different than my usual eating however I feel like my portions were somewhat smaller. Perhaps the junk I ate yesterday is catching up with me today. I wish Contrave was in ""FULL FORCE"" so I could have had like one cookie and then ""meh"" afterwards. But I'm not getting that. I am getting impatient. To be clear, I have been on full dose for a week & 3 days now. 
 I am glad the holidays are behind us now - at least for me, so I am not around junk. I got hummus, nuts, triscuits and Greek yogurt for snacks or small meals. I'll continue to update - hopeful. 😔",2,1735244251.0,Contrave,0,1.0,False

I've actually been a barista for a while! I worked at two coffee shops in Vancouver, where I had the pleasure of working with a La Marzocco Strada and a Victoria Arduino Black Eagle.

After years of enjoying pour overs at home (V60 is my go-to), I decided it was time to bring the espresso experience home. Looking forward to dialing in my shots and enjoying delicious cortados and lattes.
