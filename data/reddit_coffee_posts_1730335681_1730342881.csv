One of the busiest shopping streets in the world.

It’s a typically cold, drizzly Saturday morning in March. 



I’ve taken the three-hour coach ride into town to meet up with a friend and do some ‘social freedom challenges’.

Having missed out on so much of life, because of social anxiety, I’ve decided to start trying to face my fears.

This is the first time I’ve tried such a thing and to say I’m nervous is an understatement.



But I’m sick and tired sitting on the sidelines and watching life pass me by, so I’ve come into the Big Smoke to face the dragon head on.

The plan is fairly simple: to make eye contact with and greet as many strangers as possible. 

This sounds like a trivial task for most people. 

But when you’ve spent decades in the grip of social anxiety, it most certainly isn’t.



I’m terrified. 



Coming into the centre of London has taken just about every ounce of my courage.

But I had such high hopes on the coach coming down here.

Images of high-fiving strangers and sparking up conversations with random people danced through my mind.



However, now I’m actually here, the positive expectation of an hour ago has evaporated.

I feel small, scared and nauseous. My skin starts to prickle with sweat.

I feel like a rodent trapped in open ground. Exposed. Vulnerable. Nowhere to run to.



“Let’s get a drink first and chill out for a bit. It’s too hot out here.” I tell my friend, stalling for time.

Inside the coffee shop, I nervously nurse a bottle of sparkling water. Absentmindedly tracing the condensation drops with my fingers while I think.

My stomach is in knots. If I head back to the coach station now, I can be home in time for the Saturday afternoon football match on TV.

At least I tried. This just isn’t for me. Best to head back to the comfort of home.

I can always try again another time. I’m just not ready yet.



“So, shall we get out there then?” Dan suddenly asks, derailing my train of thought.



He also suffered with terrible social anxiety when he was younger. 

But, whereas I avoided my problems, he deliberately moved to London to overcome his fears. 

In the three years that he’d been living here, he’d done thousands of these kinds of challenges. 



To add to the humiliation of defeat I’m starting to feel, I remember that Dan is almost ten years younger than me.

I open my mouth to apologise for wasting his time and give him a litany of empty promises about how I’ll “come down another day” when I’m “feeling more up for it”.

But something stops me before the words have a chance to form.

Macho pride. Male bravado. Masochistic tendencies. Whatever you want to call it. My reply shocks me,



“Yeah, come on. Let’s get after it.”



We step back out into the gloomy bustle of Oxford Street.

People from all corners of the globe throng everywhere.

I restate my intention to start greeting people who come my way. 

I add a bit of authoritative emphasis to try and convince both Dan and myself that I’m going to actually pull it off.



We set off and my eyes scour the hordes of oncoming people for a receptive target.

Eyes are glued to phone screens or deliberately avoid my gaze.

My eyes ricochet quickly from face to face. Everyone's the same.

A legion of iPhone zombies.

This is going to be harder than I thought.



A young guy with dreadlocks about my age walks towards me, eyes roaming free from his phone for a moment.

I nod and say “Hi”.

No recognition. Not even a rude snub, just total blankness.

As he passes, I see why.

His ears are stuffed with white airpods.

How the hell am I going to complete my challenge if everyone is in their own little world?



We press on further past the entrance to the Underground station.

People crisscross from all directions.

I’m feeling self-conscious and shaky. I can feel my face turning red.

The crowd is a blur of colourful shopping bags and grey, deadpan faces.

A busker plays the guitar loudly to my left. His jangling chords are like shattered glass in my ear..

It’s all getting too much.



I can feel an anxiety attack trying to spiral up from the pit of my stomach.

“Hi”, I try again weakly as a woman with jet black straight hair walks by.

This time a quick flick of her eyes shows that she’s registered me, but she’s otherwise unmoved.

It’s no good. 

I’m like a fly bouncing off car windshields.

Too feeble and ineffectual to have any impact.



I begin to question my life choices. I begin to question myself.

“Why the hell am I even down here in London trying to say “Hello” to strangers?! 

Why do I even need to practice something so simple?”

Why was I born like this?”

My mind begins to spiral into bitter thoughts of my childhood and who I can blame for my problems.

But, I’m brought back to reality by a shove from behind as a group of teenagers in Canada Goose jackets push past me.

I need to get out of this crowd.



We decide to cross the road to Regent Street where it’s quieter.

We walk north past the Nike Town store and I stop against a wall to try and compose myself.

“I don’t think I can do this mate”, I tell Dan

The hostility on people’s faces. My own insecurities. It’s all too much.



It wasn’t that long ago that I was totally housebound by my anxiety. 

So, even coming into London has been a success I say, trying to console myself for my failure.

We turn and head back to the Underground station. I will get the tube back to Victoria and take the coach back to the countryside.

There I will sit on my couch and beat myself up incessantly for being so pathetic and failing yet again.



As I envision this and the evening of rumination ahead a surge of courage fills me.

I see a woman, probably in her early sixties, coming towards me.

Before I know what I’m doing, I lock eyes with her and blurt out,

“Hi, how are you?”



The woman’s face is long and drawn, with an almost angry expression.

“Excuse me?”

She stops next to me.

This was a mistake. I should never have done this.

“I..I..was just asking how you are” 



Her face transforms.

The defensive mask cracking into a huge smile. Her previously pinball eyes suddenly light up.

“Oh! I’m fine, thank you.”

She carries on walking. The exchange must only have lasted a matter of seconds, but my whole world has changed.



I am dumbfounded.



The woman was so warm and friendly. But had I not spoken to her, I would only have seen her harsh, dour expression.

In that moment, I realised I had been hoodwinked. Duped. Swindled.

I had been taking people at face value my whole life. 



Where I had seen crowds of standoffish, intimidating people, I now saw countless bright souls all cowering behind the defensive armour of scowls, screens and airpods.

It wasn’t just me that was scared to engage. It was everyone.



I had previously thought about how we are all colluding in the depression that is spread by social media. 

We compare and despair over the curated images of other people’s ‘perfect’ lives believing they are OK and we are not. 

And yet every person is feeling the same and perpetuating this lie - this insanity by consensus.



But this was the first time I realised we are all also colluding in the mass loneliness and anxiety of the world.

We keep others at bay with our self-defence mechanisms, while all the time dying inside our protective shell for want of the nourishment of human connection.



On that day, I made a promise that I would do my part to break this absurd cycle. I began greeting people wherever I could. Every single day. Without fail.

In elevators. In grocery stores. Waiting in line to top up my phone credit.



In the years since that promise, I have spoken with thousands of strangers from dozens of countries.

And I am always amazed by how interesting and warm most people are. Regardless of how unapproachable they may initially appear to be.



So please don’t buy into the lie. 



Do your part to reverse the insanity we are heading towards as a species. We all have a part to play in the loneliness epidemic.

And it can begin with a simple smile and a “hello”.

1gg4fp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1gg4fp6/am_i_loosing_my_mind_help/,Am I loosing my mind? HELP!!!,"Hello guys I really need your help/experiences…

So I quit caffeine 8 weeks ago. The reason I quit was that I got sick mid August. When I am sick I usually don‘t drink coffee. I used to drink up to 4 cups of coffee a day. Also I started drinking energy drinks frequently this year. Not the forget other sodas and chocolate. 

After a few days of being sick I started to feel a weird feeling in my head. It is really hard to explain for I never had this feeling before: It kinda feels like I‘m dizzy but it‘s not really dizziness. Also head feels somehow heavy and a bit tingling or something… During the span of 2 weeks I felt very fatigued. I also went to the ER, the Doctor told me she thinks it‘s the infection that causes these symptoms and that I should just recover a bit more. (I had no idea about caffeine withdrawals at this point and I unintentionally tapered down my intake in thosw 2 weeks)

My symptoms got better and for 1,5 weeks I felt pretty normal again. I also think that I just had one coffee a day these days because I suffered from Insomnia during my 2 weeks of hell. Then one day I ended up having like 4 cups of coffees and a small coke again. I already felt a bit nauseas in the evening. Then I went to sleep and woke up in the middle of the night with a panic attack. I also felt this weird feeling in my head again as I described before. The next morning I looked up if u can feel like that bc if too much coffee. After my research I decided to quit caffeine for good. I also quit nicotine the same day!

The first 4 weeks were awful. Here are all the symptoms I had:

- Most importantly this weird feeling in my head
- brain fog
- headaches
- flu like symptoms coming and going in those 4 weeks
- anxiety and panic attacks
- pain in my body, especially back pain a few days
- 3 days I had shortness of breath
- sometimes a tightness in my thorat
- nausea
- insomnia
- tiredness
- fatigue

… maybe I forgot some

After those 4 weeks my symptoms got better and after week 5 I almost felt completly normal again besides some moments, but the smyptoms didn‘t last long, maybe like an hour. 

Now, one week ago this stupid feeling in my head started again and wouldn‘t go away since… And whats new now since yesterday is a tingling in my hands. At this point I am just scared.

Has anybody experienced similiar things when quitting caffeine? Or am I just going crazy at this point and my symptoms are bc of anxiety? Or even maybe Post-Covid? I really don‘t know what to do anymore…

I also went to the neurologist this week, they measured my blood flow, all normal. I didn‘t really get an answer tbh, she said she thinks it‘s bc of different factors like both qutting caffeine and nicotine but also the infection and stress. She told me I should do a MRI but it‘s really hard to get an early appointment, what I found so far would be in Februrary…

Does anyone of you has an Idea what my situation is…? Is it just my body healing from my addiction or something else? I need some encouragement in those darkest times of my life.",1,1730342188.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

There are different versions of these lyrics, but I grew up with the cast album of the 1957 Broadway version. The song is a sort of conversation between a group of Puerto Rican girls who miss Puerto Rico and a group who prefer Manhattan. The introduction is sung by Rosalia and Anita:

**ROSALIA**  
Puerto Rico,  
You lovely island . . .  
Island of tropical breezes.  
Always the pineapples growing,  
Always the coffee blossoms blowing

**ANITA**  
Puerto Rico . . .  
You ugly island . . .  
Island of tropic diseases.  
Always the hurricanes blowing,  
Always the population growing . . .  
And the money owing,  
And the babies crying,  
And the bullets flying.  
I like the island Manhattan.  
Smoke on your pipe and put that in!

The song then continues in that vein, often going back and forth line by line.

Now, to be fair, the lyrics were written by Stephen Sondheim, not a Puerto Rican, but I can't help but think that Anita might have agreed with that comic.",1,1730342089.0,TheGist,0,1.0,False

[One of the darkest on-set events to happen in Hollywood history is the helicopter accident on the set of Twilight Zone: The Movie. It was the last day of shooting, and star Vic Morrow, along with child actors Renee Shin-Yi Chen and Myca Dinh Le (ages six and seven), were shooting a Vietnam War battle scene. While running from the helicopter, it lost control and crashed into the three actors, killing them. The scene was deleted from the final film, but the overall segment starring Vic Morrow was still included when the film was released in 1983.](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/actor-and-two-children-killed-on-twilight-zone-set)
2. The shoot had flouted safety restrictions before. According to crew members, Landis also decided earlier in the shoot that real shotguns and live ammunition would be used in a scene. After seeing the shotguns, Morrow initially refused to film but was coaxed back into the shot by Landis. According to crew members, Morrow then had to run to avoid the gunfire.
3. [Real ammunition was also used in the 1985 film Come and See, and the actors were shot at with live rounds, with bullets apparently passing inches from their heads. There's also a scene where a cow is shot with a machine gun — this really happened. And Aleksey Kravchenko, who was 14 when he began filming, was reportedly forced to adhere to a ""starvation diet"" during parts of filming in order to appear emaciated.](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/ww2-film-come-and-see-used-live-ammunition/)
4. [Speaking of animal cruelty on set, the tiger in Life of Pi almost died during filming. An on-set monitor wrote in a leaked email, ""Last week we almost fucking killed King [the Bengal used in the film when the CGI version was not realistic enough] in the water tank. This one take with him went really bad and he got lost trying to swim to the side. Damn near drowned. I think this goes without saying but don't mention it to anyone, especially the office! I have downplayed the fuck out of it.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/amatullahshaw/book-emoji-quiz)
5. [Using wild animals in movies — especially big cats — has an extremely sordid history. Perhaps most famously, a bunch of the actors involved in Roar (which featured ""132 big cats, one elephant, three aoudad sheep, and a collection of ostriches, flamingos, marabou, storks, and black swans,"" according to star Tippi Hedren) were injured by the animals. Writer/director/producer/Tippi's then-husband Noel Marshall literally had to star because no other male star wanted to work with that many dangerous animals. The other stars were Hedren's daughter, Melanie Griffith, and two of Marshall's sons.](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-front-row/noel-marshalls-roar-humans-were-harmed-in-the-making-of-this-film)
6. [The same cannot be said for the monkey star of the Every Which Way But Loose sequel Any Which Way You Can, who allegedly died after being beaten by his trainer. Author Dale Peterson and chimp expert Jane Goodall claimed the chimp had suffered abuse for years, originally having been trained using mace and a pipe wrapped in newspaper. Before filming began, a book by Peterson and Goodall claimed he'd been beaten to make him more docile. When his work was almost done on the film, he was reportedly caught stealing donuts on set. He was then allegedly beaten for 20 minutes with an axe handle and died of a cerebral hemorrhage.](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-aug-27-et-brief27-story.html#:~:text=Near%20the%20end%20of%20filming,after%20of%20a%20cerebral%20hemorrhage.)
7. [And do you remember the Disney movie Snow Buddies? The filmmakers brought in 30 golden retriever puppies to use in the direct-to-DVD movie, but they used only 15 in the initial filming. Why? The other 15 puppies were sick with giardia and coccidia. It turns out the puppies were only six weeks old, two weeks shy of the age requirements for using puppies in film (which are in place because younger dogs shouldn't be separated from their mothers and are at increased risk of illness). Parvovirus had also been rampant in the area for six months and infected many of the puppies. Five of the puppies ended up dying.](https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristenharris1/disney-animated-movie-ranking)
8. [This isn't Disney's first instance of animal cruelty. A number of lemmings were allegedly purposely killed in the 1958 Disney documentary White Wilderness, popularizing the myth that the rodents engage in mass suicide. As it turns out, the filmmakers reportedly pushed the lemmings off the cliff to fake the shot. In fact, kids were allegedly paid to capture and bring lemmings to Canada (where lemmings are not native) in order for them to be killed for the film.](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&articles_id=56)
9. [But we can't speak about animal cruelty without discussing Cannibal Holocaust. The film was so horrifically violent and offensive that in Italy, director Ruggero Deodato was charged with obscenity and later murder after it was suspected that some of the actors had actually died in the film. The actors literally had to come to court to prove they were alive. Deodato was also charged with animal cruelty (though it was later overturned) because multiple animals had been killed onscreen.](https://www.cbr.com/cannibal-holocaust-director-was-charged-with-murder/)
10. [The notorious flop The Conqueror wasn't just famous for being genuinely terrible — it also may have killed dozens who worked on it. The film was shot near a nuclear testing site, where a high amount of fallout accumulated right near the movie location. Star John Wayne was reportedly aware of this fact — he apparently took his sons to look at the massive radiation spikes registered on a Geiger counter. The film was shot for thirteen weeks, then subjected the cast and crew to additional exposure when director Howard Hughes shipped in 60 tons of the radioactive dirt for reshoots.](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/movie-toxic-killed-john-wayne-tragedy-conqueror/)
11. [Something similar may have happened with Stalker, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. The film was shot in an abandoned hydroelectric power station in Estonia, downstream from a chemical power plant. Tarkovsky, his wife Larissa, and star Anatoly Solonitsyn all later died of cancer, which sound recordist Vladimir Sharun believes was caused by the radiation exposure on the set.](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/feb/06/andrei-tarkovsky-stalker-russia-gulags-chernobyl)
12. [Jeepers Creepers was ruined for me when I learned that its director, Victor Salva, had previously been convicted of the sexual assault of the 12-year-old star of his film Clownhouse (which was funded by Francis Ford Coppola), as well as of filming the encounter and possessing child sexual abuse images. He was only in jail for 15 months before going on to find major success in Hollywood, most notably for the Jeepers Creepers series, which was in part produced by Coppola.](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-jun-11-ca-salva11-story.html)
13. [Léon: the Professional (originally released as The Professional in America) is made all the more creepy when you know that it was likely inspired by a real relationship the director, Luc Besson, had with a teenager. Luc Besson was 31 when he began dating a 15-year-old named Maïwenn, who he had known since she was 12. The two had a child when Maïwenn was 16 and married. She later said, ""When Luc Besson did Léon, the story of a 13-year-old girl in love with an older man, it was very inspired by us since it was written while our story started. But no media made the link.""](https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/luc-besson-leon-the-professional-truth/)
14. [One of the most disturbing behind-the-scenes facts about Candyman is that real bees were used in the scene where bees emerge from Candyman's mouth. Star Tony Todd wore only a dental dam to protect himself so the bees would not fly directly down his throat, but he was still stung many times. ""I negotiated a bonus of $1,000 for every sting during the bee scene. And I got stung 23 times. Everything that's worth making has to involve some sort of pain,"" Todd revealed.](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/25/how-we-made-candyman-virginia-madsen-tony-todd-bee-sting)
15. [A lesser-known creepy fact about the film is that Virginia Madsen, who played Helen, was hypnotized before scenes with Todd to put her into a trance. It was effective — Madsen said that after being hypnotized, she ""really couldn't see the crew,"" and ""all the lights became very, very blurry."" In fact, it worked so well that it freaked Madsen out — after she couldn't even remember a full day of shooting, she refused to be hypnotized again.](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/25/how-we-made-candyman-virginia-madsen-tony-todd-bee-sting)
16. [Similarly, Possession director Andrzej Żuławski reportedly ""hypnotized his performers and put them into a fugue state before shooting certain scenes."" Star Isabelle Adjani suffered a mental breakdown after seeing a finished cut of the body horror–heavy film about a married couple's breakup that turns bloody, according to Żuławski. Adjani apparently said it took her years of therapy to recover from the role, which included a graphic miscarriage scene.](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/possession-most-notorious-cult-movie-ever-1242928/)
17. [First AD Beau Marks revealed that on the set of Predator, they literally had to hire a bodyguard for actor Sonny Landham...because they were afraid he would become violent. ""Sonny ... was crazy,"" Marks said. ""We ended up having to hire a bodyguard to protect the world from Sonny and to keep him in check. Because if he started drinking all bets were off."" Apparently, the insurance companies for the movie required that the bodyguard be hired after he was found at a club ""on the floor, crawling around the floor, and either he was touching or kissing women's legs.""](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/predator-oral-history-arnold-schwarzenegger-film-1014132/)
18. [Multiple films have used real skeletons rather than fake ones, including Frankenstein, Poltergeist, and Dawn of the Dead. The last example is one of the most interesting — the props department had been told the skeleton was fake, only to discover later on that it was a 30-something woman who had died a century before when a police officer noticed it looked a little too real in the display window of a props store.](https://www.cbr.com/movies-use-real-skeletons-more-often/?newsletter_popup=1)
19. [Some films even use real cadavers (aka, dead bodies) — sometimes unknowingly, like in the case of Apocalypse Now. When police investigated, they found that the cadavers were real and actually being supplied by grave robbers. In fact, local authorities had to investigate everyone on set because the bodies were unidentified, and the people could have been killed by someone on set.](https://www.cbr.com/movies-use-real-skeletons-more-often/?newsletter_popup=1)

23. [Disaster almost struck during this Pearl Harbor scene from Tora! Tora! Tora!, which featured people running from an exploding plane. This wasn't supposed to happen, and the stuntpeople running from the flames were really running for their lives.

24. [The ending of the thriller Sliver almost caused the death of three people when they accidentally crashed into a volcano. The film was supposed to end with Sharon Stone and William Baldwin's characters' helicopter flying into a volcano. They filmed right above Kīlauea in Hawaii to get the footage, with pilot Craig Hosking flying. He hit the lip of the volcano and crashed. Hosking was rescued immediately, but it took two days to find director of photography Michael A. Benson and visual effects cameraperson Chris Duddy. In the end, they were all safely extricated from the volcano. The footage was used in test screenings, but after a negative audience response, the ending was changed.](https://www.filmstories.co.uk/news/the-blockbuster-whose-big-finale-nearly-killed-three-people-then-got-cut/)
25. [Finally, let's end on some messed-up facts about The Wizard of Oz. To make her look younger in the film, star Judy Garland was reportedly put on a diet of black coffee, chicken soup, diet pills, cigarettes (80 a day), and amphetamines. Her ex-husband Sid Luft also claimed that the 40-something munchkin actors would grope her on set by putting their hands under her dress. For her starring role, Garland was reportedly only paid $500 a week, which was closer to Toto's salary than any of the male leads.](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/09/8455229/judy-garland-actress-true-story-life-death)
26. [Garland wasn't the only one to have a dark experience on the set of the children's classic.

""They dusted his face and hands with aluminum powder…real aluminum dust,"" his daughter Kiki Ebsen revealed. ""It was in the air. And because the lights were hot, his makeup melted several times a day. So he had to be reapplied with aluminum dust. And he inhaled it over time. It coated the inside of his lungs like paint.

She and I are not very sexually active, but we decided to try something out of pure curiosity and the heat of the moment. She decided to sit on the head of my penis, but it didn't go much further than that. She only stayed there for a short time (about 1 minute) and nothing went further other than the head.
I didn't ejaculate inside her, but we're afraid she got pregnant from the pre-cum.

I was already doubting this fact because the penis didn't go all the way in, not even half, making the fertilization process much more difficult. And my research has shown that there are far fewer sperm in the pre-cum for proper fertilization to occur, and the ones that do come are usually defective.

This happened a week ago, and so far the only signs given are that it could be confused with periods.
For the first two days, she had a brownish discharge on her genitals when she put her finger in to check. The first time it looked like coffee and the second time it was lighter and never appeared again. We were scared because if it was a period it'd be normal for this to only get worse (more brownish) over time, but it was the opposite.
In the last few days, from yesterday to today, she put her finger in again to check and it came out whitish and odorless.

She hasn't had her period since the beginning of the month, and we thought it was strange, since her period was around the end of the month.
As far as she remembers, she wasn't in her fertile period when it all happened, but she doesn't remember the last few days she had her period, so I don't know if it would be very appropriate to take that into consideration.

We're afraid to use pills or something like that for fear of our parents' reaction, so if everything indicates pregnancy we don't know what to do. Can anyone help us?


Before i forget about it, i've told basically everything to ChatGPT, which he said the odds were really low, due to only the head being inside and some other factors, and the delay in her period could be from this stress we're both facing. I've read about it on the internet and i've learn this type of emotions can affect periods, so i don't really doubt it.

1gg49td,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1gg49td/guardianship/,Guardianship,"My sister and I decided to co-apply for guardianship of our parent. When the attorney sent the application to be notarized I got it done the same day and my sister said she’d be unable to for several more days. Our parent was in a situation of urgent need of a guardian to get her into a proper care situation so frustrated that she was causing unnecessary delay I politely suggested that I’d be able to do the full guardianship if she was too busy to handle it. She took extreme offense to that statement and completely severed communication. The next time we met with the attorney he advised that we can proceed as co-guardians (separately applying for person and estate) but in case the judge wanted just one of us to be full guardian we needed to be prepared to give an answer and we can’t be in disagreement. We talked privately and went back and forth in circles for hours and got nowhere, she was being completely irrational. I asked the attorney if med-arb was an (both of us paying our share, attending voluntarily and the outcome is legally binding and not appealable). He said yes and can locate the mediator for us. I asked my sister to reimburse me half of the attorney’s retainer I had paid and a few weeks later she transferred me the full amount instead of half. I assumed she thought somehow by giving me the full amount I’d just let her take over and do what she wanted, I planned to sent half back afterwards. We held our med-arb session and it was determined that I should be the guardian. She then revealed that the money she “reimbursed” me was from our Mom’s account! Shortly following the call I received the docusign and signed. Two days later my sister still had not signed. She was attempting to have modifications added to the document and refusing to sign until her unreasonable demands are met and her behavior became extremely erratic. She shipped a best brother coffee mug to my house from Amazon with a really nasty gift note, changed my name in her contacts to backstabber, blocked my number, etc. Worried about my sister’s behavior and that she took money from her, I began helping my Mom in preparation for becoming her legal guardian and got my sister off her bank accounts and me added and my Mom had a locksmith rekey her house so she could get some of her belongings because my sister had her only house keys. The attorney said he’d proceed with filing the application for me to be guardian then he suddenly received notice from the attorney ad litem appointed by the judge to represent our Mom that she had filed an emergency show cause hearing over lies my sister told her and for conducting mediation without notifying the attorney ad litem. It turns out my sister doesn’t have any money except what she gets from her husband and what she takes from our Mom and over the last 2 years is over $45,000 so she got the attorney ad litem to basically represent and fight for her at the expense of the ward’s estate. At the show cause hearing I felt that the attorney ad litem was attacking me and making me out to be a controlling manipulator trying to keep my sister from our Mom which is completely opposite of the truth because it’s based on the lies my sister fed her. I also felt that our attorney did not defend me or correct her statements with facts and did not call out my sister who is now under investigation by Adult Protective Services for financial abuse because she is still his client too and if he called her out he’d have to contest out and we’d both need new attorneys, but if he has to protect her then how can he adequately represent me? I feel that I’d rather have a new attorney to represent me independently before our next status hearing. The Judge sounds like he wants to appoint a private guardian.

Hi guys, just wanted to ask a quick question and see what you all think, ive taken a break the last maybe 7/8 weeks from working out, not for any medical reasons or anything It was my birthday month and I turned 30 so had a few things planned for it as well as other events I had going on too so I thought it was the right time for a break, usually I’m fairly good whenever I’m on my break but this time round there was a lot of drinking and binge eating involved and I ended up gaining substantial weight and my belly has gotten back to an outtie daddy belly and my muscles have all gotten flat, whenever I am training I do fastened cardio 4-5 days a week and do full body workouts for every session with a 20 minute cardio session at the end first thing in the morning.

The advice I need is ""understanding"" some of what he said and what others think of if it sounds like he isn't sure. Sorry if this is a little long and not straight to the point I also want to just write out some of the things I liked in our romantic relationship.

With that out of the way he and I were dating for about 2 and a half months, but have been very close friends for more than a decade. Our friendship has always been different, very close, closer than others, but we have never been good at staying in contact. Whenever we have reconnected we have picked right up as if no time had passed. He reached out to reconnect about a month before we started dating, from about a week after reconnecting I new something was different, he was texting more often then in the past.

When we started dating I would wonder when I would feel love for him, what it would feel like, when I would know, etc. I dwelled on that for about a week but at some point just stopped and started enjoying our relationship. Now that he broke up with me I realize that I had serious feelings for him, probably not the level of love, but close. It was great for the first month. He was very romantic, we went to Karaoke his singing was amazing, never new he had a voice like that, that was also the first time we danced. He asked when someone was singing a slow song, I liked that so much. I invited him over one night so we could watch a show he brought a soda over for me, we watched about 3 hours of that show and cuddled on the couch throughout. One of the biggest things that hurt that first month was within about a week of us starting dating he confided in me a major event that happened in his life that changed him. I wrote about it here from another throw away account. But it broke my heart, and made me realize how valuable, meaningful and important friends are, how you can't take them for granted, and can't let them slip away for you may never be able to see them again. That hurt so much because he is the kind of friend that you are lucky to find one friend as good as him once in your life. I'm tearing up writing this.

But then after all the great times the first month, he lost his job at the beginning of the second. He was fired, he had found a new job real quick, started working but went from working 3 days a week to 5 days a week. He started pulling away, it was harder to spend time with him. Then about 2 weeks before he broke up he rarely texted me. He stood me up one day, he had slept in, I understand that, but it hurt when even after he woke up he didn't let me know that he wasn't feeling up to it. He then went on a trip to a festival and was MIA for most of that time. The day after he got back is when he broke up with me. About 5 days later we had coffee so I could ask more questions now that I had my wits about me.

My initial thought was that something had happened at the festival, but he told me at coffee that nothing happened. His reasoning for the break up is that he's been waiting for feelings of love to develop in a romantic sense, but that that just didn't develop. He said that any love that he has for me is more toward our decades long friendship, and how I am his oldest, closest and most cherished friend. I asked him what prompted him to think about this, and he said that his trip to the festival got him outside his comfort zone and allowed him to take a look back at his life here. I asked him if there was ""something"" / a ""connection"" something more there than ""lust/sex"" and he said yes we did / do have something deeper than that but that it doesn't extend to the level of love toward me.

I told him thank you for the break up, even though it feels like shit, I wasn't happy the last couple weeks, with how distant he was, not communicating much, not spending much time together. I also expressed how I regret not asking for us to ""take a break"", return to being friends for a time and let him get his life back on track, get back to a better place for him to put in what's needed for a relationship, back to where we were before he was fired. How I feel we may be in a different spot not necessarily now but in a few months if I had had the guts to ask. The past is the past, hind sight is 20/20, but the kind of friends we are I feel a break would have worked, remove the expectations of a relationship, allow him to get back to a good spot and then restart things.

I had asked him why he decided to reconnect 4 months ago. He said he didn't know, that I had come into his mind, that he had started at his now former job was stressed and wanted to be around someone (me) that he knew he could just be himself around. That he felt he had to filter himself at work and that he's never had to filter himself around me. I had asked him why he asked to start dating, I didn't note down his exact response but he said that it felt right, and still feels those same ways about me, just not to the level of love. I then asked some questions that may not be necessarily my business, but knew he would answer I asked him how many of 2 women he dated did he tell about what happened to him, he said he told one of them about it some time after they broke up, and the other was some time during their relationship. I asked about some of the guys he's been in relationships with, he's been in 2, he said that he never felt like he was able to be himself with them, that he felt most comfortable with me (gave similar reasons as above).

I had also told him how what happened to him made me feel, how the night that he told me I could immediately clear as day vivid detail see it right in front of me, and how that will always be with me, when ever it comes into my mind that same vivid image pops into my mind as well. I was tearing up a little as I was telling him about that and he got up, came over to me and pulled my head into his chest/stomach area for a hug.

Probably about 30 minutes into talking to him he had said that he would still be into and ok with us cuddling, maybe around the time that he gave me that hug. Later on he made a comment about me sounding spiteful and I joked that I won't Lorena Bobbitt him (chop his dick off). He made me laugh because he didn't know what I was referring to, who hasn't heard of Lorena Bobbitt, but I digress. He said ""I thought you liked my dick"", told him I do, we talked about a few other things on that subject and he said ""I will leave this for you to initiate and I don't want you to feel taken advantage of (or something like that), but I wouldn't be opposed to us having sex on occasion (again or something similar, it was better put, nicer way, I'm summarizing of course)"".

Some quick clarifiers I am gay, he is Bi. He came out to me a couple weeks after we reconnected, and I came out to him a week after he came out to me. So when he reconnected with me he didn't know I was gay. Another thing is that we both went into our romantic relationship with the understanding that if it didn't work out that we COULD NOT let anything get in the way of our friendship, simply too important, long running, and meaningful. Another thing is the day before he told me how he felt about me and we started dating he had made a statement similar to ""I'd like to retire on a boat, and it would be nice to pour a drink and have drinks with you"".

Now with all that said, what I want some ""advice"" on. To me some of what he said seems counter to other things he's said. He said that he doesn't feel love for me, but that he felt most comfortable with me, that he could be himself, not filter himself, etc. Some of how he described his feelings toward me as a friend, that he has love toward me, but not in the romantic sense. How he's open to us still cuddling, and sex if I want to. He always focussed so much on me during sex, he new how I get stuck in my head, and would always do things in an effort to make sure I was in the present he would jokingly harass me to be in the present, and ""get the fuck out of your head"". I don't know, I just need some thoughts on this, because the way he said some of the things, that are making me wonder, were said in a genuine caring way if that makes sense.

Thank you for any thoughts, or advice on what he means. Even if people feel that he may not be sure or know what he wants, that he may ask to start things back up. I need my friend back and am moving forward either way under the assumption the romantic relationship is over, that there is no ""getting back together"", and we are going back to the kind of friends we were before. I guess the biggest thing is if people feel that he may not know or be sure of himself that I may simply say to him ""If you develop more serious feelings for me later on, please be sure of yourself before telling me, but I'm moving forward as if that won't happen"".

EDIT: I had also asked him what gender he sees himself settling down with, he didn't really have much of an answer but did say that he would like to have a child of his own someday.",1,1730341463.0,askgaybros,0,0.67,False

Im a 31 yr male who lives at home with about 3k in savings, and drowning in CC debt.  Both my parents own a small business in North Vancouver, Canada but however they are still working their tails off.  I do have a career in paramedicine that ive been in for 3 years, work alot of hours and the cash is coming in.  

 However my money management isnt great.  This has been a problem for me since I got out of high school. I spend my money on alot of things whether its online subscriptions, amazon purchases, gym memberships, etc.  Whenever im at work i tend to buy lunch/dinner, coffees and snacks.  I do pay my parents 1k in rent every month however they thought i was saving lots of money.  Ive been lying to them that i have a alot of savings and that I should be able to put a down payment on a place sometime in the next 2 years.  

I finally confessed to them that i dont have alot in my savings and they were furious.  Rightfully so, when they have paid for my schooling, they pay for groceries and also paid off my car because they wanted me to save to buy a house for my future.  They want to sell the business soon however they think retirement isnt really an option until i have settled into my own home.  

I feel like ive let them down big time and most importantly I've let myself down by lying and also not seeking out help when i should be.  I have a solid career and making a good money every paycheck.  I also have no TFSA or RRSPs started.

For reference, I owe about 12k in my mastercard and 3k on my visa.  The accumulation of debt has been building up throughout my 20s and havent been able to get out of it since.  I spend more than i save and need to get of this hole that I've dug.  

Anyone here that has recovered from this mess or is in a similar situation like me.  Any advice would be appreciated.

For most of 2023, I was living in Peru (I'm a gringo) where I contracted 2 or 3 parasites/bacterial infections which I took antibiotics for and got rid of, and another 3 or 4 parasites/infections that I healed with plant medicines at an ayahuasca center or that went away on their own. My last 4 months in Peru were spent at the ayahuasca center, eating simply and frequently drinking plant medicines, and my gut was in excellent condition.

However, I returned to the States very underweight, because I ate only 1.5 meals a day while doing lots of physical labor. So for the past year I've been lifting weights and eating in a caloric surplus and successfully built substantial strength and muscle mass.

The hard part: for reasons I've yet to determine, I've been having multiple bowel movements a day, most of them loose and watery, for most of this past year. Minimum 3, sometimes 7 a day. Usually 2 or 3 BMs in the morning and often 1 or 2 more in the afternoon. My butt often bleeds from wiping so much. First I thought I was lactose intolerant and cut out dairy; some posts here indicated the problem might be insufficient fiber so I started taking psyllium husk. In the last month, I have quit coffee, cut down on oils, and gone vegan, expecting some combination of those to solve the problem; that's doing *something*, because I feel *generally great*, but my gut seems to be in about the same place it was before.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Should I give up on trying to solve this dietarily and see a GI doctor? Maybe I've had a bacterial infection this whole time that they can fix overnight with a pill. I just don't want to waste time and money and am looking for some guidance.

  
**Have tried**: cutting diary, increasing fiber, lots of weights and cardio, fermented foods like kimchi, vegan diet (although maybe my gut just hasn't adjusted to all the beans/legumes yet--it's been a month), quitting coffee/caffeine, less oil, more fruits and vegetables

**Haven't tried**: seeing a doctor, pharmaceutical solutions (except for Imodium a couple times), intermittent fasting / not eating after \~7pm, eating less, doing a long fast",2,1730341094.0,Biohackers,4,1.0,False

One of those times he had smiled and waved. When we matched, we had a moment where we both recognized each other. He truly seemed genuine. We went on a coffee date. Afterwards, the convo seemed to take a turn to the “dirty” side… we had sex the next time we saw each other. Afterwards, I asked him if he wanted to hang out on the weekend. He said he was always visiting family on weekends, most likely could do a Tuesday since he’s free that entire day. He texts me “Hi :)” on Friday afternoon…. I texted him back. No response from Friday and it is now Wednesday. I have never been ghosted my entire 27 years of living. Completely baffled as this guy lives right across from me. And he’s 33 years old. Seriously couldn’t just communicate? I was going back and forth between sending him a long text message. I ended up doing it to get myself closure. I sent him this: I don’t know if you’re going to see this and at this point, I really don’t care to hold my silence. I’m not sure why you just went MIA all of a sudden, but you could have had the common decency and easily communicated whatever the reason was for it. We’re both adults here. I’ll be honest — you did not strike me as the type of person who would be like this. Not expecting a response either because well, your silence speaks volumes already. Good luck in life. :)

As the title suggests, I’m interested in hearing how people are finding their beans.  I’m a research nut myself and will spend hours researching roasters by state/city. 

Some resources I use:

*Coffee Beaned (https://coffeebeaned.com/coffee-roaster-list/) - Find roasters by state.

*Coffee Review (coffeereview.com) - Find new award winning roasters and coffee. See the latest roasts being submitted for review.

*Trade Coffee - A subscription 

*Regular research - Researching by state, city, etc whenever I travel or plan to travel. 

I see quite a few people posting international and obscure roasters and would love to know what resources I’m missing. Let’s share how we can all get ahold of the best beans possible.

Thanks!

I was considering subscription boxes like FairyLoot, which send a book along with themed items such as scented candles, snacks, drinks, artwork, enamel pins, bookmarks, jewelry inspired by the story, and so on. However, since these subscriptions can be quite pricey and sometimes aren't accepting new customers, I'd like to put together my own version for her. I will send her a book in a decorative bix, with ""loot"", every 3 months.

Since I'm not well-versed in fantasy literature, I'm seeking recommendations for books that she might enjoy, along with ideas for related items that would complement the book and enhance the gift.  Unfortunately, I do not have time to read a whole bunch of books myself to find the books that have good things to include as loot, so I'd really appreciate the help.

Things she likes in books / books&authors she enjoys

* LOTR
* Sarah J Mass
* Skullduggery Pleasent
* Cozy fantasy
* Standalone books (not a requirement, she also reads series)
* Animals (this is a big one. Anything heavily featuring animals is a big plus)
   * Birds are a plus
   * Also rabbits, dear, fox, bats
* Druid / Nature related things
* Colorful covers
* Young Adult Books (again, not a requirement)
* Less Sci-fi, more High Fantasy, however, mixed genres, or other fantasy are acceptable
* Lesser known books
* Fae (although this can be overdone)

Things she likes in ""loot""

* Specialty Teas or Coffees (This one would be great, she loves these things)
* Bath and Body Products
* Any sweet or savory snack (no dietary requirements)
   * Cured meat, and mini rolls are some favourites, to give some ideas
* Perfumes, candles, intense, etc
* Jewelry
* Things she will not understand until she reads the book, but are not spoilers (she likes the intrigue)
* Soft toys
* Little trinkets, e,g ornaments, little paper things, anything really
   * It does not have to be expensive. If it is related to the book, she will like it. Even a small plastic gizmo would be fine
* Exclusive Author Content
* Music Playlists
* Recipe Cards

Photos were taken with a iPhone 13. The outdoor photos were taken on a late afternoon during North American Autumn. Indoor photos were under \~3000K ceiling lights. Think what you will about the tailor's tape. I know it's not exact or definitive and I don't mean for it to be. But I'm just reminded of my frustration sometimes when guesstimating dimensions based on background objects.

Barefoot pics (serious: as a reference for why I might describe the fit my way vs. another wearer). Sorry imgur kept saying this album didn't exist when I started uploading the pics other than the Brannock photo, so this other album is what I could get that would cooperate.

I should disclose that these are the first boots I've owned. So everything I say here can be taken with several grains of salt. r/goodyearwelt was helpful though when trying to decide on nice boots, that I wanted to leave another data point of, at least, sizing with this Kujang last, which has pretty varying descriptions of how it fits. This post went way longer than I aimed for, but the material is already here, so I'm just leaving it.

# Specs

* $650 at time of purchase, before shipping
* Size EU 44
* Last: Kujang
* Upper: Brown Latigo Horween
* Lining: Tan Lined
* Midsole: Single Midsole
* Outsole: Dr Sole Red Brown Cork Half Sole
* Welt Color: Antique Brown
* Edge Color: Antique Brown
* Welt Stitch: White
* Construction: Flatwelt 270
* Toebox: Unstructured
* Heels: Regular Heels

From what I gather, all of Briselblack's shoes are hand-welted. From wearing this pair, I'll add that these seem to have come with the structured/hard heel counter. The heel height (from ground to insole) is about 3.5 cm. I'm too lazy to break out my scale, so I'll use the package weight - which was printed as 2.5 kg - which puts a single boot in the neighborhood of 1 kg AKA \~2.2 lbs.

# Shopping

Briselblack is an Indonesian MTO. They were formerly named Benzein. The inherent customer service perils of ordering from small Indonesian bootmakers have been discussed on the internet before, which dissuaded me from Briselblack MTO.

I was looking for a generalist, deep brown Chelsea and my first choice was Grant Stone's Chelsea in brown calf. However, that option is currently not offered on their website, and the rep I emailed in October 2024 responded that that option had been discontinued, I'm not sure since when. I could not find secondhand ones in my size.

However, Briselblack currently has a Ready To Wear section of their website, and this pair was not yet sold. Briselblack's web presence used to only include Instagram, I'm unsure when their dedicated website appeared. Even though the brown Latigo on their webpage looked lighter than I was targeting and sizing questions remained, I took the gamble after a few weeks of intrusive thoughts about The Seventh and many hours of research. I accepted that if I actually received the boots, and the fit was unlikable, that I'd need to organize a resale rather than pursue a refund.

After checkout with Paypal, the boots were shipped the first business day after, and in two more business days, were at my door in the US. I had no communications, emails, or messages with Briselblack prior to checkout, and none after checkout other than the automated order messages from their website and DHL tracking emails.

# Quality

The boots came in a sturdy cardboard-like branded box, packed snugly in the cardboard shipping box. There was no damage to the inner box, and hardly any on the outer box. For the boots themselves, I did not notice any visible, actual quality control flaws. They looked pretty much like their website photos on my laptop screen, slight color differences aside. The leather looked and felt smooth with no meaningful creasing. If there are any blemishes that can be spotted in the out-of-box photos, they were not really perceptible to me in-person.

The leather color is a little darker and more matte under 3000K lighting compared to the webpage's, which I'm happy with. I don't think it quite has that coffee creamer lightness I was hesitant about, it's just a clean, medium brown, and goes proportionately darker or lighter depending on lighting. I'd be comfortable wearing this casually as well as with a business suit, the shade blends with both outfits well, which is exactly what I was going for. Honestly, idk how Latigo patinas, but I guess I'm not worried about it.

I can confirm that Latigo - at least the one used here - is stiff when starting out. It remains fairly stiff and structured - but more pliable and molded in the wear areas - with over 50 hrs of wear so far. I don't believe it's as stiff as that glossy dress leather (not talking about shell). I've heard both that Latigo tends to crease finely, or that it rolls more than crease. By this writing, there's fine creasing across the upper vamp starting from the flex point down until the toe tips. I don't really see rolling. The creases are fine enough that it's difficult to distinguish at more than a 3-4 ft away in moderate light.

The joint where the top of the heel counter meets the shaft has slightly heavier, but fine, creasing. My outer ankle joint has barely imprinted a bulge in this section. The vamp creases feel slightly dry and rough compared to the rest of the leather, so I'm contemplating a dab of Bick 4 in the coming weeks. There's hardly any scuffing to speak of, though I don't deliberately bang my uppers against doors or on each other.

I picked the pair with tan lining specifically because a commenter said Briselblack's red lining bled onto their socks. So far, no staining from mine.

By the time of the outdoor pics, I've worn the boots for about 50-60 hrs total over the last month, 2-3 days a week at my 9-5 desk job, grocery shopping, and walking across parking lots. I don't remember if I've worn them during rain yet. I started using Woodlore Ultra Large trees 2 weeks after I received the boots. I brushed occasionally with a Red Wing horsehair, no conditioning as of those photos.

# Fit

The fit is difficult for me to capture in a sentence. I'm a Brannock 11C (11 HTT, 11 arch length/HTB), when I measured myself in athletic socks, and later by an Allen Edmonds rep in-store fwiw. I have Greek foot, my second toe is longer than my big toe by like a quarter of a cm. I'm not flatfooted.

I've been wearing these boots with cotton, athletic tube socks. I'll get around to better socks eventually. I haven't had pain anywhere or visible blistering while wearing these boots, mostly just irritating rubbing and mild digging where my outer ankle rests against the shaft above the heel counter edge - which eased noticeably by hour 40 or so as the leather there started breaking in and I was also putting trees in. My foot doesn't feel any weird veins, bits, or lumps on the insole or interior - feels fairly seamless.

**Heel, toes, volume, lifting**

The notable shortcomings for me are some instep and heel room, and thus a little heel slip/lift. I estimate half or three-quarters of a cm extra space between the side of my heel and the inner side wall of the heel cup, if I slide and press my heel up against the base of the other wall. When like that, I can fit the skinnier span of my fingers next to my heel, but to do so, my fingers mildly swell the shaft side and spill over the insole edge by a half cm.

There's also around three-quarters of a cm between the back of my heel and the actual heel cup or counter, when the rest of my foot is in a natural, comfortable spot in the boot - with the sides of my big and third toes gently butting the inside of the toebox and the ball of my foot just cupped at the widest point of the vamp. The ball of my foot doesn't really push out the sides of the vamp, and the ball doesn't slide laterally any more than 1-2 mm even when I scoot my foot back to give the ball as much room as available.

In the natural position, if I were to measure from the very tip of the inside of the toebox to the tip of my longest toe, I estimate there's one quarter of a cm. If I push my foot forward so that my second toe physically brushes the inside tip, then all my toes, except the second, get crushed from every direction.

I second that the Kujang has a higher instep, but idk where my bare foot ranks on the volume spectrum. My toes hug the ceiling of the toebox until about the toe joints with the foot, where maybe half a cm of extra vertical space is formed. That half cm continues, more or less, for the remainder of the ""tongue"". Once the front shaft starts. there's maybe a half to three-quarters of a cm between the front of my ankle and the front shaft wall.

It's weird because the shaft feels like it fits well, and it's sorta hard to slip on the boot, even with that forward room. The elastic up to now has been quite stiff and crisp. If my ankles ever roll, they supinate. So when just standing, at neutral, my ankles naturally press against the outer side of the shaft. I don't ever really press against the inner shaft or quarters.

Interestingly, my heel doesn't really slide around unless I've deliberately dug the heel block into the ground and started scooting my foot in some direction. On heel strikes, my heel doesn't jerk back into the heel cup, the back of my heel continues to stay a half to three-quarters cm from the counter. Likewise, my toes don't slide or crash in the toebox. Together, the cradling toebox, the sloped-in heel cup, and the pressed shaft secure my foot remarkably.

When there is heel lift, it's no more than a half to one cm off of the insole. And that one cm only ever happens when my foot is majorly bending its flex point, forefoot pushing into the ground. If my foot is mostly flat or resting - I practically cannot make my heel lift even a quarter of a cm - if it even leaves the footbed at all - even with the existing instep space and even if I've lifted my foot into midair and shook it. Any of the lifts haven't interfered with my gait or taking stairs.

While this might not be the fit envisioned for Chelseas, I've actually appreciated the vertical breathing room in Kujang. I previously realized that my Vans Eras annoyed me at my desk job with how low they restrict my toes, especially since I replaced the factory insoles with Superfeet Blues. That snugness combined with a dense outsole creates a firm sandwich that keeps me from satisfactorily wriggling my forefoot in order to relieve muscle tightness.

The Seventh has enough internal flexing room for me to freely stretch and scrunch while in the shoe - particularly the joints at the ball of my foot - keeping me comfortable when I haven't walked for the last hour. I wouldn't say I'm swimming in this boot though. It's counterintuitive to the shortcomings I've noted, but my foot feels in-control and the boot still works as an extension of my foot. I end up not noticing the fit as I go about my day.

**Soles**

What I did need to get used to was the height of the heel blocks. Coming from flat-soled sneakers, my habit is heel striking. I can't extend or push out my heel when stepping forward as much as I normally do - my heel hits the ground earlier and does some heel drag if I'm not focused enough while walking. In addition, the circularity and hardness of the rear heel makes heel strike contact feel less steady. Basically, a little point of the circle has gripped the ground while I rock the rest of my foot flat onto the ground. The circle edge doesn't collapse or is grippy like a sneaker outsole, which means my foot rolling or swiveling from the weight of the boot is easier if my footing isn't sure and my ankles aren't firm. I've adjusted by mentally aiming for the middle of the heel on my strikes in these boots, rather than the very rear.

The mass of the midsole and outsole provides little ground feel, numbing my sense of how even the ground is or whether I'm stepping on a pebble. I haven't noticed any slipperiness with the Dr Sole outsole, including for concrete or tile. This is probably obvious, but the boots also have that leather sole hoofbeat sound. Dr Sole dulls the clacking, but my footsteps are always audible on hard surfaces if I'm not taking baby steps or on tiptoes.

**Suggested sizings**

The Meermin size chart, currently on their website, lists EU 44 as being the direct equal to a Brannock 11. My impression was that others who fitted well with the Kujang, and listed their Brannock and the EU size they bought, seemed to align with the Meermin chart in terms of which Brannock was equal to a Briselblack size. In the absence of a RTW Seventh in 43.5 or a 44 narrow in trim that I wanted (or any 43.5 being available), on Briselblack nor any secondhand site, I opted for a 44 rather than go down to a 43.

Even though by going TTS I got breathing room, I'd be reluctant to size down at all on Kujang. With the regular 44 forefoot width being just within the bounds of comfortable, if I were to size down even a half-size, I'm worried that the sides of the ball of my feet and my toes would feel nuisance levels of firmness - enough to keep being reminded of it. Also with the amount of heel and instep room I perceive in 44, I'm unsure how much difference a 43.5 would have in making those areas snug.

I'd even hesitate on a 44 narrow, since a comment said that the Kujang's narrow shaves off half a cm not just on the instep, but on the ball as well. Briselblack sometimes suggests a full size down from Brannock for Kujang, but there seems to be more than one comment where the normal-width Kujang is too narrow in the toes when that suggestion is followed, and I'd imagine it'd be even worse if I was a Brannock D+ width.

I read a comment somewhere that the Indonesian lasts can trend towards being not anatomical. I tend to agree with that for this last. The Kujang shape fits many settings well, but I'm skeptical its proportions would fit many men's feet well ymmv.

**Extra reference point:** I tried an Allen Edmonds Liverpool in 11D before The Seventh, because the instep looked like it might be similar to the Kujang. The Liverpool fit snug - including the heel - but it was a bit tight at the front of the ball of foot, and laterally across the toes. My toes did not reach the tip of that boot, there was maybe three-quarters of a cm of space. There was maybe a half cm or so of space in the instep - which felt alright to me. The next width they had in-stock was an E, which they wouldn't even bother to bring out.

# Conclusion

I can't speak to Briselblack's MTO experience. But as far as The Seventh I got my hands on, I think this gamble turned out good enough. I see how the Kujang could go wrong for many and contribute to a poor value. But I don't consider these boots to be unsustainable or a bad fit for my feet - mine feel fine in them. Probably ignorance is bliss, but I'm genuinely pleased. I do wonder though whether I would get the same results if I received 3 more pairs of the same size and model from them over the course of like a year.",0,1730339416.0,goodyearwelt,0,0.5,False

I was getting ready to go to work and came to my car, to find out that my car was broken into. Talk about Monday misery, it just added to my melancholy. 

I was beyond shocked—it was an abhorrently vexatious situation. I felt an unfathomable level of sorrow for my car, who must've been terrified to be harassed and assaulted like that by someone with ill intentions. However, thank goodness that nothing was broken. No windows/glass were broken or shattered, no parts were stolen, my car wasn't stolen, nothing from my car itself was even stolen. However, it was definitely broken into, which raised quite a few qualms regarding the Acura safety system within me. 

I was awfully stressed because I had no idea how my TSX was even broken into in the first place—nothing was broken. I locked him the night before after coming back from work too. I always double lock until I hear the beep sound. And even if I hadn't locked my car, I know that my TSX auto-locks within a certain amount of time.

Nothing seemed to have been stolen, however all the compartments were opened and everything was taken out. I've included pictures. Even my trunk was left open. All of my documents from my globox were rummaged through and the seats were reversed back into their original setting and angle. Even the mirror had fingerprints on it.

It is an understatement to say I was simply distressed. 

On the bright side at least said debauchéed person left everything in a neat pile on the passenger seat but they left footprints on the floor mat in the back seat and left some white powder fingerprints on the exterior driver door (must've been coke or something).

The way every single compartment and part of the car was gone through and emptied made me think that it was someone looking for loose change or valuable items to steal (not that there was anything to steal anyways, unless they wanted cheap plastic sunglasses, a sunshade, arm sleeves, car dusting cloths, phone holder, and a pencil honestly). I leave nothing in my car, not even a plastic water bottle out in sight, so this was exceptionally weird. 

I have no idea how my car was broken into though. I was told that you can use an electronic device to unlock a car or that the car hacker was probably just skilled at breaking into cars, but even so how could've it happened? Wouldn't an alarm have gone off? I didn't hear my car's alarm going off that night at all. I additionally thought that Acuras have a decent safety system, although I guess not considering it was so easily broken into..? I just saw someone post that their Acura got stolen so I wonder if Acuras are one of those cars that are easy to steal...? I really love my TSX and cannot imagine being separated from it. I love it to death.

My friend told me I was lucky my registration document/title/proof of sale wasn't stolen. Neighbors told me it's just this city; apparently car break-ins are as common of a thing as drinking coffee in the morning lol. 

Does anyone know how my car may have broken into? What are some ways I can better protect it? Should I get a front and rear dashcam that works even when my car is turned off? Are there any upgraded protection systems that I can install into my car? Any advice would be appreciated.

Since it seems like Breville is phasing out the Infuser, we initially considered the bambino plus, but are hoping to have more of a forever machine and are concerned about Breville longevity.

We make two milk-based drinks back to back every day, plus americanos and occasional espresso. Will make additional if we have guests, so ideally we are looking for something that can smoothly handle around four drinks back to back.  We’re okay using a smart plug for longer warmup times but admittedly appreciate the quick ramp up of Breville machines.  

Budget is $2000 (ideally closer to $1500). Dual boiler seems to be the most obvious upgrade but also looking at HX, and open to other options that fit our use. Ultimately we want something that is well made, repairable, and will give us room to “grow” our hobby down the line (not currently interested in modding), while getting us and our guests a really good cup of coffee without too much of a finicky process :) 

Below is what we’re considering - any feedback on these models, or suggestions for others to consider?  

- Lelit Mara X (seems like it would be a great fit but some concerns about leaking issues….and I really wonder what machine Lance Hedrick would get instead as mentioned in his video) 
- Lelit Elizabeth (doesn’t seem to be as well made, but tons of features for the cost) 
- Profitec Pro 300 
- would *love* ECM but not sure if classika would meet needs and Syncronika is too $$
- Rancilio Silvia Pro X 
- go for Breville Bambino Plus and anticipate replacing/upgrading whenever that kicks the dust ",3,1730339169.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1gg3g6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1gg3g6q/wedding_budget_breakdown_dc_wedding/,Wedding Budget Breakdown - DC Wedding,"Hi everyone! I thought I'd share my wedding day budget breakdown, because these were very helpful for me as we were planning our wedding, which just happened this past Saturday, in Washington, DC. 

**A few general comments**

* Yes, it's crazy how expensive weddings can get, and at first, we got a lot of sticker shock from the prices and estimates we received. But even though the final cost was about 50% more than we had set out to spend, we made sure we would still be able to comfortably afford it (and we are lucky to be in a privileged position to do so) without going into debt or disrupting our daily expenses or savings plans. That being said, coming out on the other end, I think every single penny we spent was worth it, because our wedding day went perfectly, and we can't imagine doing it any differently. 
* We made a conscious decision to keep details as simple as possible, whether that meant minimal decor or a straightforward timeline with no extra games or activities. This not only helped keep costs down but it also minimized the things we had to stress over. 
* Our wedding started at noon, as dictated by the church's availability, with the reception ending at 6 PM. At first, we thought that might be awkward timing, but it ended up working out really well, as most of our guest were locally based, so they were able to get home at a reasonable hour, and we still had the evening to enjoy our first few hours as a married couple. We're also a bit older (mid-30s), as are our guests, so we weren't interested in throwing a rager of a party. Some of our friends organized their own after parties. As a bonus, we also had really beautiful lighting for photos at the church, which we wouldn't have had if the wedding had started later in the afternoon.
* We somehow ended up booking our wedding day during one of the busiest weekends in DC. This did make traffic a bit heavier, but we also locked down our hotel room block early and ensured our out-of-town guests all had their flights and accommodations confirmed as early as possible. 
* Our wedding ceremony and reception were in a popular part of the city that is well connected, so we didn't arrange separate transportation. The two venues were also less than a 10-minute walk apart. The one minor regret/stress I had was parking, because neither venue offered their own parking for our guests who were driving in. But we warned our guests well in advance and recommended several nearby parking garage or rideshare options; luckily, only a few guests had mobility issues that we made separate arrangements for. 

***Now for the breakdown (prices rounded):***

**Total number of guests:** 95 people (100 invited)

**Total overall costs:** About $55.5K

**Catering: $26,000.** By far our most expensive vendor. This included three passed hors d'oeuvres for cocktail hour; three appetizers and three entrees served family style; open bar with two signature cocktails, wines, beers, non-alcoholic drinks; all rentals (including tables, chairs, linens, plates, flatware, etc.); staffing; cleaning/garbage removal; and admin fee. This was, believe it or not, one of the more affordable options on our reception venue's approved caterers list, but it was also one of our favourite restaurant groups in the city. It was a million times worth it, because the food was literally perfection, and our guests enjoyed a menu that was different from the ""standard"" wedding fare. Many of them said it was the best wedding food they've ever had.

**Church reservation: $2,300.** This is a well known, historic church in the city. It was my dream church to be married in, so I had no qualms about the cost. It also included the wedding ceremony music (organist and cantor).

**Reception venue: $7,000.** Among the venues we toured, this was pretty middle of the way in terms of pricing. This included use of the space (including outdoor patio) for 8 hours (including 4 hours total for set up and clean up, so 4 hours of actual programming) as well as some accessory furniture that we could use. We also just fell in love with the aesthetic at first sight.

**Day of Coordinator: $2,000.** 1000% worth it. This actually covered six weeks of support/service from the DOC, as well as an assistant on the day of. They took over vendor relations starting six weeks out from the wedding, put together our timeline, joined the final logistical meetings with other vendors, and were stuck to us by the hip on the day of to make sure we had everything we needed. I'm very organized and have planned several events in the past, but I'd still recommend a DOC if you want to be able to actually enjoy your wedding! In terms of pricing, I think our DOC ended up being on the more affordable side, but the quality of their work and service was at a premium level. 

**Photographer: $6,000.** Among the ones we were looking at, our photographer was probably on the slightly more expensive side. But they are extremely talented and we loved their portfolio. We also didn't hire a videographer, because we prefer photos (I like the romanticism of capturing a moment in time), and we were willing to pay a premium for photography, since that's the main thing that lasts after the wedding. Our friends and DOC ended up capturing some key moments on video anyway. This included 7 hours of coverage (though our photographer and the second shooter actually ended up shooting an extra hour at no extra cost), engagement photos (which we love), and digital photos. 

**Florist: $800.** We only ordered personal florals (i.e., bouquets, boutonnieres, and corsages) as our family did the floral centerpieces for the reception. It wasn't easy finding a florist who didn't have a minimum spend of several thousands of dollars, which usually necessitates decor florals, but our florist was just starting her own studio so she offered a la carte options, which was perfect for us! The flowers she prepared were absolutely beautiful.

**Cake: $1,000.** We set out initially for a smaller cake, but we wanted to hit the delivery minimum so that we wouldn't have to stress about driving a fragile cake to our venue. We ended up with stunning (and delicious!) custom designed three-tier cake that was also the dessert for our meal. Several guests mentioned how wedding cake is usually not very good, but they absolutely loved ours.

**DJ: $1,100.** Covered four hours of service, so basically our main wedding reception. This was perfect -- we used a Spotify playlist for our cocktail hour, to save on time/cost/logistical complexity. The DJ company had an app that we could use to upload our playlists and fill in all the day-of details, so the process was very smooth. The DJ also served as our MC.

**Make-up artist: $1,300.** Included make up for bride, bridesmaids, and mothers, travel to our getting ready spot, as well as make up trial, all covered by us. Our MUA was on the slightly more expensive side, but we found her based on recommendations, and I was picky about our MUA as I've had bad make-up experiences in the past. She was fully worth every penny -- everyone was extremely pleased with their make up (my mom talked about it all weekend) and I cried all day, yet the make-up didn't budge! 

**Hair: $800.** We also covered hair for everyone who got their make up done. The hairstylist was a reference from our MUA, because they work well together. She did a wonderful job, and I think she will be my regular hairstylist going forward!

**Rehearsal dinner: $2,400.** This included the cost of food and drinks + booking the private room at one of our favourite restaurants for about 35 guests. We got rave reviews about the food, and there was some leftover because we had over-ordered.

**Rings: $2,000.** For both wedding bands. Doesn't include my engagement ring.

**Stationery: $1,000.** All through online vendors (Minted and VistaPrint). We used Minted for our save-the-dates and invitations, because we liked their designs the best (and the paper/stock choices felt premium) but VistaPrint for our signage and day-of paper (e.g., programs, menus, etc.) because they were the most cost effective. Good customer service experience on both fronts, and overall we were pleased with the quality.

**Wedding insurance: $500.** This was required by our wedding venue, but we may have gotten it even if it wasn't, as I tend to be risk averse.

**Parking permit for church: $55.** To reserve four parking spots in front of the church, which we got through the city government.

**Random decor/accessories: $85.** We kept the decor relatively minimal because between the flowers, the beautiful venue, and the rentals, the reception already looked pretty full (and our church was beautiful without any additions). Mostly on Amazon. 

**Day of breakfast catering: $150.** We got bagels, fruits, and coffee for everyone getting ready at our place on the day of from a local bagel shop. More expensive than the supermarket, but it was convenient to have everything ready to serve and easy to pick up.

**Post-wedding preservation: $1000.** This includes dry cleaning and preserving my wedding dress and preserving my bouquet (I found a local flower artist who will dry out my bouquet and arrange the flowers in a floating glass frame as a keepsake). 

**Dress: $0.** I was very, very lucky that my aunt, who owns a bridal dress shop, gifted me my wedding dress. Of course, the cost savings were welcome, but more importantly, it was wonderful having someone who knows me and my style very well and whom I trust help me find the perfect dress. I'm extremely grateful to her. 

**Wedding favours: $0.** My mom made a few hundred beautiful, natural soaps for our guests (she's been making soaps for a while). We made sure to have our relative pass them around during the reception to make sure all of our guests got their favours, because we noticed a couple guests who left early didn't notice them.

I think that's everything! I haven't included costs for our honeymoon (which we're taking next year) or the personal beauty I did in the days leading up to the wedding (hair, nails, facial, etc.) because those are services I would have gotten normally anyway. But really, it was the perfect day, and it all seemed completely worth it at the end.",5,1730339153.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False
1gg3fnj,https://i.redd.it/lnfjt4wjyzxd1.jpeg,"Thursday 10-31-2024 - 🌱 Cultivating Your Garden of Abundance • Word of The Day ""Abundance Thinking"" • [Click to Expand]","## ✨ The Art of Abundant Living

Let me share something transformative with you about the power of abundance thinking. You know that feeling when you believe anything is possible? That's your abundance mindset peeking through. It's fascinating how our brains are wired - when we shift from thinking ""there's never enough"" to ""there's plenty to go around,"" everything changes.

I've seen this play out in my own life. Back when I was stuck in scarcity thinking, I'd constantly worry about missing out or losing what I had. But here's the thing - the moment I started focusing on all the opportunities around me, they seemed to multiply. It's like putting on glasses that suddenly let you see all the good stuff that was there all along.

Let's talk about affirmations. They're not just feel-good statements - they're actually rewiring your brain! When you consistently tell yourself ""I attract abundance effortlessly"" or ""Opportunities flow to me naturally,"" you're creating new neural pathways. Pretty cool, right? Your brain starts looking for evidence to support these beliefs.

Gratitude is your secret weapon here. Try this - each morning, before checking your phone, name three things you're grateful for. It could be as simple as your morning coffee or the sunshine through your window. This simple practice trains your mind to spot abundance everywhere.

Here's something most people miss - abundance isn't just about money or material things. It shows up in relationships, creativity, and personal growth. When you approach life with an ""there's enough for everyone"" attitude, you naturally become more generous, collaborative, and open to possibilities.

Let me share a quick tip about affirmations - make them personal and believable. Instead of saying ""I am a millionaire"" when you're just starting out, try ""I am open to financial opportunities"" or ""I make smart choices with my money."" Your brain needs to buy into what you're saying.

Watch out for those sneaky scarcity thoughts that try to creep back in. They often show up as comparison, FOMO, or the need to hoard resources. When you catch yourself thinking ""I'll never have enough,"" pause and ask, ""Is this really true? What evidence do I have for abundance in my life?""

The really amazing thing about abundance thinking is how it builds resilience. When you believe in abundance, setbacks become temporary and challenges transform into opportunities. Look at successful people like Oprah or Richard Branson - they consistently talk about abundance mindset as a key to their success.

Remember, you're not just changing your thoughts - you're changing your entire experience of life. The opportunities have always been there. Now you're just tuning into the right frequency to spot them. Keep practicing, stay patient with yourself, and watch how your world expands. Trust me, it's worth every moment of conscious effort.

I'm excited for you to discover just how abundant life can be when you shift your perspective. Your abundance journey starts right here, right now. Ready to see what's possible?

I am a girl myself I have autism so some social stuff I don't understand or just don't pick up on

I barely know this girl like yeah I had her in English last year (freshman) and I have her this year for the same class but I haven't talked to her at all in freshman year or this year nor have I talked ill about her until a couple of weeks ago for a damn good reason

So basically I walk into the room right and she sits like 4ish meters \~13ish feet away from the door this girl twists her head back to either give me stank eye, or a dirty look like I purposely spilled coffee on her white shirt or squint at me ( which tbh she looks like those chihuahua memes when she does that) I don't get why she does this so at first I just see that she's doing this shit and ignore it then were brainstorming stuff for something she comes right next to the blackboard where I and my partner her with her friend and gives me and my friend a dirty look then no word of a lie they copy everything we wrote word for word so being the kind of person i am i wrote down ""don't copy work!"" in big lettering with an arrow pointing to their ""very original and not copied work"" just to call them out like if your gonna copy ask for fucks sake. and when the bell rang she gave me the stinkiest stank eyes ever. so after that happened the next day when she gave me dirty looks i returned them bc this isn't a 1 off situation.

She has stopped since I've started returning the looks I just kinda wanna know why she did that ik it couldn't be bc I'm prettier than her bc I'm average probably below average with these Eurocentric beauty standards and me being black and being the walking opposite of it but she isn't white either also could be the fact I'm tall but what girl would be jealous of being 6 fucking feet tall 

like i know nobody will know the exact reason for those dirty looks and well asking the internet for answers isn't exactly credible could someone just give me an idea why she did it and if she does it again what i should do instead of just engaging in a dirty look off

I also have 2 university degrees, an undergrad and masters degree. 

For hobbies, I enjoy swimming, bowling, rock climbing, traveling, listening to documentaries and podcasts, but I especially enjoy going to coffee shops and restaurants. 

I am not really much of a bar or nightclub person, I don’t drink or smoke so I’d be looking for someone who is more into going to restaurants or cafes, preferably from Europe because it is much closer to my time zone, though I have traveled to the US before too and I would not mind talking to someone outside of Europe or the US. 

I am a blind person, so for me at least, looks, appearances, none of that matters for me. I am a lot more interested in the tone of someone’s voice, and their personality. For me, that is what counts at the end of the day. 

Finally, I would be interested to find someone who could ask me to follow their voice while we are talking as well, as it is something I forget to do sometimes.

1gg38r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gg38r7/aitah_for_being_upset_at_my_sister_for_constantly/,AITAH for being upset at my sister for constantly messing up my car?,"   So for some context, I (17F) have a younger sister (10F). I truly love her, but she has some of the worst anger issues I’ve ever seen in a child from cussing our parents to teachers, (not to mention she’s the epitome of a TikTok-addicted-Sephora kid) she’s quite an entitled brat. Our parents (same mom and dad) have been divorced since I was 9, and she was about 3, I feel that plays part in why my parents don’t discipline her as much as they used to do me, but that’s besides the point.

    Ever since I turned 16 and got my license I’ve had a job. On top of being in school and playing sports, I work about 20 hours per week at my part time job, making $11 an hour. Through my dads help financing (and with money I’ve saved from odd jobs), I drive a quite nice car (in my opinion for my age, a 2024 Toyota Corolla sport) and I make the almost $400 a month car payments, meaning almost every single day after school I work. My car is my pride and joy since I work a lot and hard to drive the car I have (that  wouldn’t have without my dad, love you!) not to mention I also pay for my own gas. 

    Now here’s the catch 22. living in between 2 houses (divorced parents) i am required to take my sister to school. which wouldn’t be a problem except for the fact her school is 20 minutes from mine, and i work as a teacher assistant for my feeder elementary school, so im often up at 5:30am to get my sister to school on time, and do what i have to do to fight traffic and be on time, so adding that in with hardly sleeping from getting home late from work every night, it’s rough. But speaking from my older sibling perspective, I was bullied on the bus when I was younger, and I didn’t want the same for her, so in all honestly, I don’t mind driving her- but I feel like she’s not appreciative of it (cussing me, saying she hates me and hopes I die etc- I tell my parents but they brush it off). 

    Now the main problem- I can’t just not take her to school (my parents make me) but she has over the last year I’ve had my car- TRASHED IT. always spilling things (water, makeup, etc) to leaving whole garbage bags worth of trash, wads of clothes- it’s crazy. I’ll politely tell her to get them up, and the response I always receive is a snarky “I’ll get it later.” (she never does, my parents never hold her responsible, and I end up cleaning it.) yesterday I finally snapped. I left school to hurry home and get ready for work, and noticed apparently that morning when I took her to school, she had a open mason jar of iced coffee in my backseat, and it had spilled, staining everything, including my computer. I came home upset at 2:30 (she is already home as my mom picks her up from school), telling her I was leaving for work at 3:30, and she had an hour to clean up all the mess in my car that she had made. here’s where the entitled brat part kicks in. She goes crying to my mom, saying I was being rude to her. She was mouthing off about how I’m bitchy and lazy (for not cleaning up her mess?) and my mom told me to let it go. I explained why I was upset and why my sister should clean up the mess SHE made, and ultimately, my mom got angry at me for being upset with my sister-so she told me to go to my room. On my way back into the house, I slammed the door, crying and screaming about how it’s not fair how she is destroying the car I work so hard to pay for, and how no one holds her accountable for her actions and how she talks. Now everyone is saying I overreacted. AITAH?

(TLDR: my sister spilled coffee in my car that I work my ass off to pay for, I asked her to clean it up, she’s lazy and won’t, my mom gets mad at me for being upset about it and grounds me.)",3,1730338517.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False

To the point where they are self sabotaging because they just want to take the easy way out.

I’ve (34f) had this friend group since I was 12. A woman in our group has always been boy crazy. She’s the type of person to like dedicate her life to whatever relationship she’s in like to the point where she changes who she is. So the longest she’s ever been single like six months. In 2023, she ended an 11 year marriage. 
In this marriage, she was just a stay at home wife. Had never really had any goals outside of being a stay at home wife. When they divorced, she walked away with nothing. She was single for six months and was focused on bettering herself until she tried dating again. She flew out to our hometown (where I’m at) to shack up with this guy she met online for a week. When I asked if she wanted to get coffee for an hour, she declined. I was really hurt. 
After that guy basically told her he didn’t want her, she hopped right into a relationship with this new guy who is an alcoholic. They’ve been together for a year and within that time, he is making her an alcoholic. When you look at her profile now all you see is just alcohol. It has affected her physically, she has gained a lot of weight and you can tell it’s wearing on her physically from her videos. She looks tired.
We were supposed to have our annual girls trip and now that she has a boyfriend, he’s calling the shots. He told her to tell us that we have to plan it out a year in advance and he was calling the shots as far as where she was allowed to go and how long etc. just like in her previous relationships.

Anyway, last week on Thursday, she messaged the group to inform us that she got into a car accident. She went on to say that her neck wad really hurting to the point where she doesn’t feel like herself. So everyone in the group chat was urging her to go to the hospital. She said that she’s specifically listening to what her boyfriend tells her and he scheduled an appt with her pcp on the following Monday. One of the girls in our group is a nurse and was telling her how a neck injury can literally ruin your life and to get a lawyer. She said that she was not going to contact a lawyer because her boyfriend said that insurance would take care of it.
This behavior isn’t new. Everytime she had a boyfriend, all basic survival instincts go out the window. 
We ended up getting into an argument via group chat. We expressed that if she’s taking his advice then he needs to do better. She cussed us out. 

Today, she just posted this picture of her on a random vacation in Utah with her boyfriend. I think I’m just done. I can’t watch her destroy her life. I can’t watch her obvious negligence. I’m thinking about just ghosting her. Taking her off socials. This hurts but this is driving me crazy. It hurts to watch.

Sophie’s been in this weird existential phase lately, questioning everything about life and death. So, one rainy night, she walks into Dose Coffee, and she ends up sitting near this older guy named Emanuel, who’s tucked away in the corner. They start talking, and his voice is low, almost hypnotic. He talks about life and death in a way that’s unsettling, as if he knows something no one else does. Just before she leaves, he leans in close and whispers, “Meet me tomorrow at the Cronquist House for tea. I have something to show you.” And, of course, Sophie’s curiosity gets the best of her.

The next day, she actually goes to the Cronquist House. There’s a table set for two, like it’s been waiting for her, and the house is eerily silent, as if the air itself is holding its breath. Then, this old woman with piercing eyes appears in the doorway. She asks Sophie, “Looking for Emanuel, are you?” Sophie nods, already feeling uneasy, and the woman’s expression turns grave. “Emanuel Cronquist has been dead over a century. He appears to the lost… right before they vanish.”

At this point, Sophie’s terrified. She looks down at her teacup, and there are two words scratched into the porcelain: “Behind you.” She turns, but there’s no one there. When she looks back, the old woman has vanished.

Then her phone buzzes. It’s a message—from her own number—with a photo of her sitting alone at the table, taken from behind. The message reads: “We’re waiting.” The door slams shut, and Sophie realizes the walls are… shifting, almost dissolving into shadows around her. She tries to scream, but the silence is overwhelming, like it’s swallowing her whole.

The creepiest part? That night, I went to Dose Coffee, and the same old woman, with those sharp, knowing eyes, handed me a cup and whispered, “Meet me tomorrow at the Cronquist House.”

1gg2nx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1gg2nx6/how_to_handle_the_resentment/,How to handle the resentment,"I'm really struggling with resentment. We have two SK's 50/50. When they're not here, everything is great. When they're here, life completely changes and my DH isn't there for me and our baby in ways I want him to be. 

For example, on the Saturdays and Sundays that we have the SKs, they play sports. This takes up the morning until lunch usually. It's too hard with baby's nap and timing. I did go once but it's not that enjoyable with HCBM there anyway. So I stay home with baby while they're out. How can I not feel resentment when on their weekends I spend both mornings without my DH and when they're not here we have nice mornings with DH, me and baby and go out for coffee etc? 

Same applies to the many after school events they have. I stay home while they all get home late, as school is far away and it's not logistically possible to come get us and go back that way.

Or even tonight. I'm at home with baby and we both have colds. They're all going out for Halloween when they get home. I would've gone too if I weren't sick. But now I don't get a DH coming home to give me a break while I'm sick. 

The thing is, I realise my DH is doing nothing wrong here. These are all reasonable things he needs to do with his kids. I couldn't ask him to do anything different as all he's doing is being their dad. But I just cannot stop feeling bitter about it when I'm constantly left at home. And if I'm sick or lonely or whatever, he can't just be there for me, whereas I can always be there for him. 

Sorry for the rant and hopefully this makes sense. I just want a little guidance on how to handle these feelings when you're left alone to stew in your resentment wishing your DH didn't have these other responsibilities. ",5,1730336816.0,stepparents,2,0.86,False

1gg2kjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gg2kjv/after_burying_a_cursed_doll_strange_things_keep/,"After Burying a Cursed Doll, Strange Things Keep Happening","I hadn’t thought much of the doll when I first found it. It was tucked away in an old cardboard box at the back of my grandmother’s attic, covered in years of dust and mystery. That attic was a strange place, a forgotten realm of antique furniture, broken clocks, and faded family portraits that stared out with eyes that seemed to follow you if you stayed too long. I’d never explored it thoroughly before, but I was helping to clear it out after my grandmother’s passing, sorting through decades of memories and relics, deciding what to keep and what to let go.

The doll was small, no more than a foot tall, with delicate porcelain skin painted in hues long faded by time. Its dress was once a soft pink, now dulled to the color of aged rose petals, frayed at the edges. But it was the doll’s face that stopped me. Eyes of glass stared straight ahead, unblinking and oddly alive, set against painted lashes and cheeks dusted with a faint blush. The expression was neither a smile nor a frown but something in between, an eerie neutrality that made me hesitate to pick it up.

But I did.

The doll was lighter than I expected, almost hollow, as though it were just a shell. I turned it over, looking for some kind of maker’s mark, but there was nothing. No sign of where it came from or who made it. Just that strange, empty face. The attic seemed to grow quieter as I examined the doll, and a prickling sense of awareness stirred within me, as though the air itself had shifted.

I told myself I was being ridiculous. It was just an old doll, nothing more. Still, something about it lingered with me as I carried it downstairs and set it on a shelf in my room. I hadn’t planned on keeping it, but something in me couldn’t leave it in the attic. It felt wrong to discard it, as though it would somehow be offended by the gesture. I kept it in a corner, facing the wall, telling myself it would go into storage as soon as I could find a proper box for it.

That night, my dreams were strange and fragmented, vivid in a way that dreams usually aren’t. I saw flashes of the doll’s face, but in each vision, its expression was slightly different—sometimes its mouth was open, as though it wanted to speak. Other times, it was scowling or grinning, too wide and too unnatural. I would wake in the middle of the night, my room dimly lit by the moon filtering through my window, and each time I woke, I would glance at the corner where the doll sat.

I’d placed it facing the wall, but each time, its head seemed to have turned ever so slightly in my direction. It was subtle, just a shift of an inch or two, but it was unmistakable. Still, I brushed it off as my mind playing tricks on me, convincing myself that I’d moved it without realizing.

The following day, strange things began happening around the house. I’d come downstairs to find cabinets open that I hadn’t touched, lights flickering when there was no breeze or faulty wiring to explain it. Objects would go missing and then reappear in odd places, as though they’d been deliberately hidden and then returned. A photo frame from my childhood was placed on the kitchen counter one morning, though I was certain I’d last seen it in a drawer weeks ago. It felt like the house itself had gained a new presence, something that moved in the quiet spaces between each heartbeat.

At first, I rationalized everything. Old houses have quirks, after all, and I was prone to misplacing things now and then. Yet, every time I tried to push these incidents to the back of my mind, a quiet unease would pull me back to that doll. I began to suspect that it wasn’t just an innocent relic from my grandmother’s attic, that it carried something dark within it, some energy that shifted and pulsed like a heartbeat. I started to avoid looking at it directly, as though avoiding its gaze would keep whatever was inside it at bay.

But the disturbances grew more intense as the days went on. I would hear faint footsteps at night, light and delicate as though someone were tiptoeing around my room, though I always slept alone. One evening, I found strange marks on the wooden floor around my bed—small, circular scuffs in patterns that resembled a child’s dancing steps, and they circled my bed in a dizzying loop. I scrubbed at them until my hands hurt, but the faint marks remained, etched into the floor like scars.

One night, as I was about to turn off the light, I felt an almost magnetic pull to look at the doll, as though it was beckoning me, silently demanding my attention. I tried to ignore it, focusing on anything else, but I felt an overwhelming compulsion, a gravity that I couldn’t escape. Finally, I turned my head and looked at it directly for the first time in days.

Its face had changed.

The once-neutral expression had twisted into something else, a look of pure, quiet malice, though the features themselves hadn’t moved. Somehow, the very essence of its face was different, sharper, crueler. Its eyes seemed to gleam with a darkness that hadn’t been there before, a depth that felt bottomless. I sat there, paralyzed, feeling a strange dread settle over me like a weight pressing down.

I tried to shake it off. Surely, I thought, my mind was tricking me again. I walked over and picked up the doll, examining it under the lamp’s light, turning it this way and that to dispel the unsettling feeling. But as I held it, I noticed something I hadn’t before—tiny, almost invisible cracks along its porcelain cheeks, thin lines that seemed to spread further as I watched.

Suddenly, I heard a whisper, faint yet undeniable, curling around my thoughts like smoke. It was my grandmother’s voice, clear and yet far away, as though she was calling to me from the other side of a long tunnel.

“Don’t keep it…”

“Let it go…”

But I couldn’t move. My hands felt glued to the doll, my skin tingling where it touched the cold, fragile surface. It felt wrong, unnatural, as though I was holding something that was never meant to be touched. I forced myself to set it down, practically throwing it back onto the shelf, and stumbled back, my breathing heavy. That night, I left the lights on, sleeping fitfully under their faint glow.

The next day, I decided it was time to get rid of the doll. I wrapped it in a thick blanket, sealing it in a cardboard box before shoving it into the corner of the basement. I felt a weight lift as soon as I let it go, a sense of relief that I hadn’t realized I needed.

But that relief was short-lived.

In the dead of night, I awoke to a soft, rhythmic tapping. It sounded like fingernails lightly scratching against wood, persistent and patient. I tried to ignore it, pulling the blankets over my head, but it grew louder, as though the sound was creeping closer. Finally, I couldn’t stand it any longer. I sat up, looking around in the dim light, my gaze drawn to the door.

The scratching was coming from outside my room, down the hall, near the basement door.

I lay frozen, staring at the door, listening to that soft, maddening sound. The scratching persisted, rhythmic and deliberate, scraping its way deeper into my nerves. I knew it had to be coming from the basement, from the box where I’d stashed the doll. I could feel it in my bones, an instinctive certainty that whatever was in that doll wasn’t content to be hidden away.

I don’t know what compelled me to leave the safety of my bed, but a strange compulsion gripped me, pushing me to confront whatever was waiting in the darkness. I wrapped a robe around myself, opened the door, and stepped into the hallway. The scratching grew louder as I approached the basement stairs, turning into a soft, eerie scuffling, as though something small and nimble was moving around down there.

I gripped the banister and forced myself down each step, the creaks of the old wooden stairs echoing around me. My heart thudded with each creak, but I pressed on, unable to shake the feeling that I needed to see it, to understand what it was that had slipped into my home through that doll. The scratching stopped as I reached the basement door, replaced by an unnatural silence, as though whatever had been making the sound was waiting for me to find it.

I pulled open the door, flicking on the basement light. The bulb flickered a few times before it settled into a dim, sickly glow. I took a deep breath and descended into the basement, feeling the chill in the air press against my skin like cold hands. The cardboard box was where I’d left it, but something felt wrong, off-kilter. I could feel a strange energy radiating from it, pulsing faintly like a heartbeat, filling the room with an oppressive weight.

I walked up to the box, my hands shaking as I lifted the flaps. There was the blanket, folded over the doll, and I hesitated, feeling that strange dread settle over me again. But I couldn’t look away. I reached down, peeling back the edge of the blanket to reveal the doll’s face.

It was staring straight at me, and its expression was different again. The face that had been so neutral now held an unmistakable rage, a fury that seemed to boil beneath the surface of its delicate features. Its glass eyes looked wet, almost real, and I could swear that they followed me as I moved. The cracks in its porcelain cheeks had spread, spidering out like fractures in ice, and for a moment, I thought I could see something moving behind those cracks, something alive and shifting, hidden just beneath the surface.

Suddenly, the doll’s mouth opened, not as a slow movement but in a violent snap, its jaw dropping unnaturally low. A whisper hissed out, faint but unmistakable, words that seemed to drip with anger.

“Why did you hide me?”  the voice rasped, though it was nothing like my grandmother’s. It was twisted, inhuman, laced with an ancient malice that sent chills through my blood.

I recoiled, dropping the blanket, and the doll’s mouth slowly closed, returning to that eerie, unreadable expression. I didn’t wait to hear anything else. I slammed the box shut and ran up the stairs, locking the basement door behind me, my breath coming fast and shallow. I told myself I’d get rid of it in the morning, that I’d take it as far from my house as I could and leave it somewhere it could never find me again.

But the night had other plans.

I barely slept, every sound in the house amplified, every creak and groan setting my nerves on edge. I thought I heard faint laughter once, drifting through the walls, a soft giggle that sent a prickling unease through my skin. But I stayed in my room, forcing myself to ignore it, telling myself it was only my mind playing tricks on me.

Come morning, I pulled myself together, threw on a jacket, and grabbed the box from the basement. I could feel the doll’s presence even through the cardboard, like an angry heat that radiated outward. I didn’t look inside as I carried it to the car, setting it in the trunk and driving out of town. I didn’t know where I was going; I only knew that I needed to get rid of it, to put as much distance between me and that cursed thing as possible.

I drove for hours, the doll’s presence haunting the back of my mind, an almost palpable weight that made it hard to think. I finally reached a dense patch of woods at the edge of a state park, far from any roads or trails. I stopped the car, grabbed the box, and walked into the trees until I was surrounded by silence. There, I dug a shallow hole, placed the box inside, and covered it with dirt, hoping that it would be enough to contain whatever dark energy the doll held.

But as I walked back to the car, a strange sensation crept over me, a feeling that I was somehow not alone, that something had followed me from the grave I’d made. I told myself it was only my imagination, a lingering effect of the doll’s unsettling presence. But as I reached my car and looked back toward the trees, I thought I saw a faint figure standing at the edge of the woods, watching me. It was too far away to make out clearly, but it looked small, doll-like, its face hidden in shadow.

I got in the car and drove away, refusing to look back again, willing myself to forget that I’d ever found the doll. I thought that would be the end of it, that I could return to my life and leave that cursed thing behind. But the dreams started again that night, darker and more vivid than before. I saw the doll’s face over and over, twisting with expressions of rage, sorrow, and something else—a strange hunger that made my skin crawl.

I tried to push it out of my mind, to convince myself that it was only a bad memory, but every night, the dreams would return, growing stronger, pulling me back to that face, those glassy, lifelike eyes that seemed to bore into my very soul. And then, things began happening around the house again. Strange sounds in the walls, objects moving from where I’d left them. The same sensations I’d felt when the doll was here, as though its spirit had followed me home, refusing to let go.

One evening, as I was preparing for bed, I found a small, porcelain finger on my pillow, cracked and delicate, resting as though it had been placed there deliberately. I recognized it immediately—it was one of the doll’s fingers, chipped and aged, bearing those faint cracks I had seen spreading across its face.

I threw the finger out the window, but the next morning, it was back, resting in the same spot, as though it had never left.

In the following days, more pieces began to appear—a fragment of lace from the doll’s dress, a tiny shoe, a sliver of glass from one of its eyes. They would show up in strange places—inside my drawers, at the bottom of my coffee cup, hidden between the pages of my books. Each piece felt like a message, that it was still with me, still bound to me no matter how far I’d buried it.

In the deepest part of my soul, I know that I’ll never be rid of it. The doll will find a way back to me, piece by piece, pulling itself from the earth, reforming, lying in wait for the moment when I am most vulnerable. And when it does, I don’t know if I’ll have the strength to resist.

All I can do is brace myself, hoping that somehow, this nightmare will end. Because when that final piece returns, when the doll is whole again, I fear it won’t be content to merely linger in the shadows.",0,1730336537.0,nosleep,2,0.5,False

I still saw him at school every week and it was always awkward, we would maybe awkwardly smile at each other. A year later I texted him asking if we could talk. We met up and I told him I wanted to be friends again, and he basically said he didn’t. I ended up confessing to him that I had had feelings for him because I wanted it off my chest. We went back to not talking for a year. Then he texted me asking if we could get coffee because he wanted to say sorry for being a bad friend and for taking me for granted. He said he’d been doing some reflection and wanted to talk.

 Kendu has been on a downward trend for sometime and while that is concerning to some number of investors and the uninitiated, the community has continued to work, shilling on all socials relentlessly. We have picked up a small portion of new holders in the recent weeks of this trend, sometimes stalling or being stuck in a range. The volume dropped to ‘indefensible’ levels, yet they were fairly consistent across the crypto memecoin boards. I was not worried.

I did NOT like any of it, but I had done enough research prior to buying to anticipate this was likely to happen. If you want to get life changing gains, 70-90% corrections are somehow the norm in this sick and twisted crypto memecoin world. Yes, clearly I love abuse and it must be something I never got enough of from various intimate partners before I settled down with one. I guess another failing in life of mine.

# Due Diligence 

I come to you bearing gifts. The redistribution from whale holders has finally turned around. We are back to growing. And gaining new holders at a much speedier clip. See pic 6 compared to pic 4-Over 70 new holders gained since 6pm EST October 28th to about 6pm today (October 29th). Volume is a really great thing to track. Check pics 1-4. The volume has been hovering around 1 million for the last three days which was a clear signal the reversal had to be coming. I would have shared this sooner, but my normie job was busy and IRL stuff and I can’t keep spoon feeding the reality. We had a volume of 338K (across all DEXs and CEXs) on October 25th. The best and worst part is, I suspect that our volume could be close to 2 million right now and at least 1.5 million, worst being the Kendu Bot is going to be down for another 5 hours and I haven’t been able to stalk the metrics since this morning.

New buyers will help to increase the Kendu volume while likely putting some extra change in your pocket. This symbiotic relationship can be a win win for all. With more volume Kendu will be in pole position for more listings and we have the funds to do so in Miazaki’s wallet. You then have a choice to make:

Obviously, I can’t tell you what will happen, but when memecoins pump they really really pump and I think the metrics are screaming we aren’t done yet. What I would hope for is that People take this DD and do some research themselves and get involved. Maybe they will be so enamored with the result we will have some converts to the Kendu Army. You will then join the ranks from our official subreddit: 

The goal is to have holders join with conviction who are going to spread this movement to their friends, family, coworkers, healthcare professionals, randoms on the street, etc. That is how we continue to grow, not just in the echo chamber of socials. Our real world products will do some to help us (Kendu Coffee, Kendu Energy drinks, jewelry, etc), but a real movement this cycle is going to require more work from more holders! One way or another see you at the top of Valhalla.

P.S. if you haven’t heard someone tattooed their pecker with Kendu Inu back in late September for the 1 billion Kendu competition ($44K in today’s price). Make a nice comment and I might share the X link…yeah there is video as it is VERY REAL.

P.P.S. volume this afternoon was at 1.57 million and the final pic 7 is current metrics I just pulled. Right before I grabbed metrics some knucklehead (you can't teach conviction and cycles to everyone) made a sell so even though this post was from yesterday it is still reflective of many of the numbers and the point becomes stronger with another day with strong volume and increasing holders! Now it is night and some not knucklehead made some serious buys.

What I like about the reflections here is the bokeh effect. It's not a mirror reflection of the surface. The water gets dark where there are waves. And the reflections get more in-focus as it reaches the horizon line. That is shown by the smaller lights under the taxi and the perspective of the lights.

So I would like to keep the ability to have the water react to what's moving on the surface. Most of what I've tried ends up with a stretched effect. Or the bokeh isn't strong enough to give the effect where the reflections are just as bright as the surfaces and comes out just blurry in the render.

Is this possible in Blender? I'm starting to wonder maybe it's because I'm just using a plane with an emission shader. Maybe actually modeling the geometry and adding lights would change the result. I'm running out of things to try. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I like chocolate or candy or coffee or drinks.... I wouldn't be opposed to a buildable Christmas scene in a Lego or Lego knock off theme.

I'm not a wine or a beer person, and I do have celiac disease so and that is definitely a consideration for the chocolate, lol

Does anyone have any ideas? ",9,1730335867.0,christmas,1,0.92,False

I think I’d eventually like a sectional as the room feels a lot more airy and cozy but feel like this works for now, so long as I put a coffee table between couches and add other styling (baskets, coffee table, etc.)

Thanks in advance! ",1,1730335864.0,DesignMyRoom,0,0.67,False
1gg2agl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gg2agl,How would you decorate my living room? ,"My husband and I just recently moved to a new condo building. We've basically started from scratch when it comes to furniture/decor etc.  My plan was to keep the furniture more neutral ish and then add in wood side tables and decor with pops of colour.  I'm not sure what colour yet. Those two chairs look gray but they're actually more taupe in person.  I do love the colours in the third picture. I'm trying to go for a cozy feel I just don't know 

1. What colour palette would you suggest? 
2. Where would you place the side tables? I'm thinking of skipping a coffee table since the space isn't big. 
3. Would you buy curtains for the windows? 

Any advice would be appreciated - this is the first place I've  had the privilege to decorate! ",3,1730335718.0,DesignMyRoom,2,1.0,False

During the days and evenings when libraries are closed are there any other cozy and quiet places to go? Im hoping there are other places that Ive been over looking like i did with libraries.
