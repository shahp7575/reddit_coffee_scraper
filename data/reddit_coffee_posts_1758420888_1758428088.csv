Piece on workplace alienation. Kakfa meets body horror



Life, with its profound meaninglessness, coils around my chest like a vice, stealing breath with its void. The congratulatory email still glows on my monitor: ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù blinks in the subject line while the cursor waits for a reply. Bigger title, bigger paycheck, same desk, same air.

 

Yeah. Comfort is a slow, sleepy descent into death.

 

I try to look away, but I can‚Äôt. The office hum presses against my skull‚Äîthe air-con‚Äôs low drone, the stale smell of coffee, fluorescent light flickering in my face. Outside the monitor‚Äôs glow, the rest of the room blurs into a static behind my eyes.

 

I try to call it out, but it won‚Äôt give me its name. It mocks my beliefs, names my fears, dares me to confront them. But I don‚Äôt.

 

How can you trust something that isn‚Äôt? Something that lives but doesn‚Äôt exist? It lodges between the hollows in my mind, picking at the soft folds of my brain. It sits there, fangs sunk deep‚Äîsilent, patient, unrelenting. It is present in the voice of my colleague, it lurks in the reflection of my monitor, when I blink,

 

it blinks.

 

I carry it with me‚Äîdesk to desk, room to room. It feeds on the endless loop of

 

Work

 

I sit paralyzed in my chair and let it crawl around in my keyboard. Sometimes the weight is heavy, so I try to rest my eyes. It snarls at me. I am never fully asleep, never fully rested. I am

 

Always.

 

Aware.

 

The company rewards me for staying: a better title, a better chair. When I try to imagine a reason for all this, it laughs ‚Äî a soundless, cavernous laugh that swallows the thought whole

 

But it is not my enemy. It‚Äôs the fragment that never detached‚Äîlike an umbilical cord anchored to the base of my skull, dripping and smelling of wet cement. It shows up when I‚Äôm driving home on autopilot, wrestling for attention. It gnaws at the side of my skull when I shut my eyes and press my head against my pillow, keeps me awake till dawn-staring at the silhouette of my ceiling fan. I am it. It is me.

 

We were conceived together. Our first heartbeat, it echoed in the same abyss. It breathes with me, we share the same pulse

 

I keep it caged. When I melt into the chair and let the air learn my shape, it snarls. It has no mouth, but

 

It mocks.

 

Sometimes, it goes away‚Äîwhen I lace up my shoes and start running in the open air. When my lungs burn and my legs ache, when my heart pounds and its rhythm drowns out the gnawing in my skull, it goes away, but it comes back the moment the air is still, I can smell it

 

It‚Äôs stale.

 

And here under the oppressive whites of the ceiling lights and the blood-red company logo, it bares its teeth. The doors close. 

 

I stand up. I step towards the light pouring through the window. I lean out like a reptile tasting the air, the office noise dulls, the air outside, cold and sharp, carries with it an air of December dews, a cool breeze from across the garden brushes my face as if wanting to caress it.

 

I almost smile. Then a low moan rolls from the heavens and the sky begins to lament. The rain kisses my face and the ground beneath, I turn my head down and the smell of the damp earth rises and snakes into my head. It‚Äôs very peculiar, it tickles my brain, as if the worms in the soil are moving around in the space between my ears. Emptying it, melting it, my brain dripping like rainwater  into the fine white marble floor. It is, blissful; It reminds me of the freedom I taste occasionally.

 

Life, with its profound meaninglessness, repeats the cycle.

 

The emails pile, and the phones ring, again and again.

1nmi6cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1nmi6cr/the_delaney_house/,The Delaney House,"I had written this story for a midterm. Any constructive criticism? 

I bought this house with the intention of fixing it up. But I truly love the features of the existing interior of the house. I enjoy the ambiance of 1920s homes and their aesthetics. The handprinted wallpaper, the wainscoting along the hallways, and the original oak mantle above the fireplace. I got this home for an amazing price, and I assumed it was due to its outdated style. As my clientele grew bigger, I needed space for all of my fine art restoration supplies and incoming commissions. Luckily for me, this house came with an abandoned painting of a couple, with the woman holding a baby in her arms. The painting was a perfect side project for me, considering my job and love for fixing old and broken things.   

On my first day in my new home, I was ecstatic about all the possibilities this place could hold. I invited over a girlfriend of mine to share a bottle of wine and help me unpack. She and I both discussed the vibes of the house's interior design. She, being more spiritually guided than I, noticed the house had a sad aura coming from it, and a smell she couldn't place. I saw her disdain for the cold, stained, and deposed interior. We laughed it off while continuing to unpack all my boxes.   

While unpacking Andrea noticed the painting I found in the house some hours earlier.   

""Is that one of your new commissions? I thought you took a break in preparation for the move?""  

""No"", I said cheerfully, ""that came with the house actually!""  

Andrea saw my proud face. I suspect she didn't want to extinguish it with her gripes about the home's weird aura.   

She smiled and smirked. ""Laura, the last thing you need is more work, you know that right?""  

""I know"" I muttered in a reassuring voice. ""But imagine how beautiful it would look in the living room once it's all fixed up!""  

She inevitably succumbed to my excitement, and we continued unpacking.  

‚óÜ‚óÜ‚óÜ 

Once Andrea left, I headed upstairs to get ready for bed. I lit some candles while the hot water for my shower was running. I proceeded to zone out, enjoying the warm water brushing against my face. Suddenly, I felt a hand graze my shoulder. I jumped and turned around to find nothing behind me. I peered past the shower curtain to see that my bathroom door and windows were still closed. At that moment, I collected myself and concluded it was simply my exhausted mind playing tricks on me.  

Turning off the water and getting into my robe, I remembered Andrea's comment from earlier. How the house had a sad aura. My mind immediately went to my house, being haunted. But I giggle at the thought of my luck ushering me to buy a haunted house. As I got dressed, I toyed with all the possible scenarios in my head. None of which I could explain without some spectral entity being involved. I again chuckled to myself, convinced it was the wine, and I was losing it.   

‚óÜ‚óÜ‚óÜ 

Over the next week I began to get more visits from what I presumed was a ghost. I was a little uneasy the first day, but I soon came to realize this ghost was more of a nuisance than scary. When I would go to get the paper in the morning, he would lock me out for an hour or so, only to let me back in exactly one hour later. Once I'd set the newspaper down on the coffee table, he'd flip the pages around as if he were sitting right next to me reading. This is what made me come up with the name Bill. The paper would always be left in a column discussing the president's achievements.  

The subsequent days after my first encounter with Bill, I tried to continue my daily routine, to no avail. Between my work and daily chores, my days were filled with persistent pipe banging, drawer slamming, and window tapping. I felt like I was going crazy. So much so that I had become angry rather than scared. On Saturday I finally had enough. 

""WHAT THE HELL IS YOUR PROBLEM?!"" I screamed.   

Exhausted and realizing I had just been yelling at my kitchen cabinets, I took a step back, took a deep breath, and collected myself. I had the impression Bill was trying to tell me something. I figured the only way to be able to truly communicate with him was through a psychic or some other means. Considering I just bought a house... I didn't want to take my chances with a sham psychic. In this case, only time will tell.  

‚óÜ‚óÜ‚óÜ 

Months passed and between renovations and upkeep, I had finished my fourth commission since buying my home. I had finally seized some free time, that I had no clue what to do with. I caught a speck of light out of the corner of my eye. The sunlight from my studio's window was reflecting off the painting that I found in my home. I had left it in the corner behind a few other passion projects. I decided to grab it and begin fixing it. As I was setting up my supplies, I began to truly observe the painting for the first time.  

I first set out to fix the large tear in the center of the portrait. The tearing of the portrait seems to be from a cut of some sort. It started from the bottom right corner and continued up toward the man's face. The man and woman in the portrait both had stern but somber facial expressions. The man in the painting has a slick back haircut with a carefully trimmed mustache. He was wearing a beautiful navy blue suit with thin vertical gray stripes. His pose complimented the woman he was sitting adjacent to, dressed in a muted, pink, vintage A-line dress. The sleeves of the dress were fluttered and layered with ruffles, angling down towards the baby lying in her lap. Unlike the couple, the baby in the portrait looked like an afterthought. It had been painted to look like it was just placed there in the woman's lap, not being held or coddled.  

It had been some time since Bill had emerged, and I had begun to think he'd vanished completely. But as soon as I began to glue the ripped pieces of the painting back together, my solvent jar fell, shattering on the floor. I groaned in frustration and headed to the closet to grab my broom and a rag. While wiping the floor down, I put pressure on one of the floorboards only for it to give out, and my hand to fall through the floor. I was startled at first, then noticed a shiny object hidden between the floor joists. Pulling it out, I noticed it was an old silver baby rattle. Out of the blue, I started to hear someone crying from my bedroom. Dropping the rattle, I walked over to see what the sound was. As soon as I passed through the door frame the crying stopped. I begin to see the walls leaking drops of water. It started at the crown molding and cascaded down the teal-colored wallpaper. It was as if my walls were crying. I rushed to the bathroom to grab some towels, but as soon as I returned, the water was gone.  

‚óÜ‚óÜ‚óÜ 

A few weeks later the portrait is finished. While adding my last coat of varnish, I feel a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over me like a wave. I head to my room to grab my camera to capture my achievement. Looking at the photo I was stunned to notice the baby seemed to be missing from the artwork. As I glance back at the painting, I'm stunned again to find the baby has altogether disappeared. I pick the painting up and stare at it trying to reason with myself.   

Could the baby have been a figment of my subconscious?   

But I remember there being a baby in the woman's lap, right?  

In an instant, I feel this sharp searing pain in my chest. I grabbed my chest and started to stumble. I reach for my desk to catch myself, as my vision starts to fade.  

‚óÜ‚óÜ‚óÜ 

I woke up staring at the ceiling, and I felt defeated. I knew deep down all the auspicious signs and omens were pointing to something, I just didn't know what. Was it Bill trying to tell me something, was it the house? All I came to realize was that I needed to know what the hell happened in this house. 

‚óÜ‚óÜ‚óÜ 

The next morning, I packed a bag and headed to the local library. I asked the counterwoman where the public records were located, and she sent me to the back of the library. She pointed to a few stalls of books and then asked if I knew what I was looking for.  

""I'm looking for any kind of newspaper article about my house"".  

""Well, where do you live darling?"" the librarian exclaimed.  

""I bought the old house on October Lane a few months ago. I've been having these strange things happen and I need answers or I'm going to go crazy"" I said with a serious but joking undertone.  

""oh"", she spoke in a worried tone. ""The realtor never told you the history of the Delaney house""?  

Delaney house? I thought.  

Up until this point, I never thought my house had any substantial history. The librarian ushers me over to a shelf and plucks a large leather-bound book with the inscription, 'Pinegrove Ledger 1920-1930'.   

She handed me the book, ""You should read it for yourself then"".   

‚óÜ‚óÜ‚óÜ 

For the next few hours, I proceeded to read through each year of this town's history. From new restaurants opening, and yearly carnivals, to high school football championships, and fourth of July firework displays. Nothing caught my eye till I found an article from 1929 that reads as follows.  

'Tragedy in Pinegrove: Mother Slays Infant, Husband Missing ‚Äî Madness Blamed in Shocking Domestic Horror""  

Pinegrove Ledger ‚Äî August 5th, 1929  

Pinegrove, NY ‚Äî A scene of ghastly violence shook the quiet hamlet of Pinegrove late Tuesday afternoon, when Mrs. Elizabeth Delaney, 25, was discovered sprawled upon her front lawn‚Äîher frock soaked in blood and her gaze vacant as a winter sky. Neighbors alerted authorities after witnessing the disheveled woman crawling upon the grass, murmuring incoherently and clutching a child's rattle.  

Upon entry into the modest Delaney residence on October Lane, officers were met with a sight most dreadful: the lifeless body of young Thomas Delaney, the couple's only child, age one, found cold and still in his cradle, bearing the unmistakable marks of violent trauma. A child once said to be ""cheerful as a spring morning"" now lay a victim of inexplicable maternal madness.  

Mr. William Delaney, 28, a clerk at the local postal office, was nowhere to be found. Despite an immediate search of the premises and surrounding area, no trace of the husband has yet been uncovered. Authorities fear the worst, though nobody has been recovered.  

According to neighbors and acquaintances, the Delaney's were regarded as a respectable and loving couple‚Äî""the picture of domestic bliss,"" said Mrs. Agnes Holloway, a nearby resident. But those close to the family reveal that tragedy struck three months ago when Mrs. Delaney suffered a miscarriage that left her health and spirit shattered.

""It was as if a shadow took hold of her,"" reported one source. ""She ceased to speak to anyone, and would sit for hours by the nursery window, rocking an empty cradle.""  

Investigators now believe that the unfortunate miscarriage may have unhinged the young mother's mind, sending her into a state of melancholic delusion that culminated in the ghastly act.  

Following her arrest, Mrs. Delaney was taken to Briarfield County Sanitorium, where doctors have since declared her in a state of profound mental disarray. During brief periods of lucidity, the woman has uttered only fragments‚Äîspeaking of voices, of shadows, and once, chillingly, ""the walls are screaming.""  

No formal confession has been given regarding the disappearance of Mr. Delaney, but foul play is strongly suspected. Though no charges were initially filed, the District Court convened a grand jury last week. The matter was brought to trial amid much public curiosity and macabre fascination.  

Yesterday, the jury returned a verdict of clinically insane, declaring Mrs. Delaney unfit to stand criminal trial. She will remain indefinitely under the care of physicians at the sanitorium.  

Sheriff Tully remarked in closing, ""It is a case that chills the very marrow‚Äîa house once full of life now only echoes with sorrow and silence.""  

The investigation into Mr. Delaney's whereabouts remains ongoing.'  

  

I was mute. How couldn't I have known? Why wasn't I told? All the pieces started coming together, the rattle, the 'screaming' walls, the disappearing baby. I only wondered now, was I communing with William or Elizabeth? I headed to the front desk to check out the book. The librarian saw my stunned face as I passed her the book. She asked if I was alright, I told her I wish someone had told me what had happened.  

""Knowledge is power..."" she exclaimed, ""...but it's also a curse"". ""My mother knew Mrs. Delaney back in the day... they were friends. She always beat herself up for not being able to see the signs or say something before it was too late"".  

Between my racing thoughts and urge to get home I asked, ""Did they ever find Mr. Delaney?"".  

""Oh, heavens no,"" she said, ""If you ask me though, I always thought he ran off with another woman"". She weirdly smiled and handed me back my book. While walking away I wondered how it would be possible for someone to just vanish into thin air.  

‚óÜ‚óÜ‚óÜ 

The drive home felt somber and uncomfortable. I had a gut feeling that Bill, or whoever they were, was trying to tell me something, I just couldn't piece it together until now. I parked and headed up the sidewalk when I noticed a light shining through my upstairs window. I didn't remember leaving a light on. The more I stared at the window the more I noticed it was, off-putting. The window to the left was my bedroom window, and the window to the right was my bathroom window. But I don't remember this window. Thinking my mind was playing tricks on me again, I ran inside and headed up the stairs. I sprinted to my bathroom and looked out the window and sure enough, there was an unfamiliar window to the right of the bathroom.   

The more I looked around my bathroom and bedroom, the more I observed there to be missing space. Almost as if there was an extra room between the two. I went out into the hallway and instinctually started peeling at the wallpaper. The plaster behind it seemed to be a different color than the rest of the house, almost lighter. I grabbed a hammer from my studio and started hacking at the wall. Piece by piece and bit by bit, the wall started to come down and behind it, I found a door. Once the door was fully uncovered, I ceased my manic exhaustion. Taking a deep breath, I opened the door.   

The room was covered in a motif of vines and flowers, all different shades of pink. To the right of the door was an empty cradle covered in decades of dust and mold. But to the left, slumped in the corner, was a man. He wore a stunning navy blue suit with vertical gray stripes. His hair and body were worn away and a hole was left in the breast of his suit. In his lap, draped around his hands, was a garnet-speckled blanket with the embroidered letters 'T.D.'.

‚óÜ‚óÜ‚óÜ 

I'm standing on the sidewalk staring at my front door. The officer next to me is saying something but I can't hear him. I watch as the coroners carefully wheel the stretcher down my porch steps and into their van.   

Part of me is relieved. The other part of me wishes this closure could've gone to the family, or to whomever is left to remember. Just as I turned to thank the officer, I felt a chill breeze brush past the nape of my neck and through my hair.   

As the van pulled out of the driveway I watched as the light in my mysterious window slowly flickered away.

1nmhwwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1nmhwwo/im_spending_today_in_bed/,I'm spending today in bed.,"I woke up at 11 (after going to bed at 1am because I was up late playing video games) and it quickly became apparent that my chronic fatigue was kicking in today. I got up and put my washing on for work tomorrow, drank a coffee, once the washing was done I didn't feel any better. So I gave up and went back to bed. 
I'm now scrolling in bed while my husky malamute snuggles in to me and my Husband is playing video games and periodically checking on me to see if I need anything.
All I keep thinking is how horrible today would have been if I had a child to look after. I feel horrendous! I can't even look after myself in this state! I know me, id have pushed through and felt guilty if I went back to bed. Instead, the only thing I HAD to do today was my washing for tomorrow, that's done.

1nmhu3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/1nmhu3o/please_help_me_find_this_i_cant_find_the_name/,"Please help me find this. I can't find the name anywhere. The teaser leads you to a create a story site, not the novel.","On a Monday night, Evan told me he‚Äôd fallen in love with someone else. He didn‚Äôt raise his voice. He didn‚Äôt even sit down. He just stood in the doorway and ruined our house.
For a second, I thought he‚Äôd said he‚Äôd fallen out of love‚Äîwith me, with life, with the smell of garlic in the air. ‚ÄúSay it again,‚Äù I said, as if repetition would sand down the edges.
His mouth worked once, twice, like a swimmer breaking the surface and regretting air. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in love with someone else, Nora.‚Äù
I stared at him. The clock above the fridge ticked like a toy pretending to be a clock. In the living room, our daughter, Zoe, sang to her stuffed rabbit without words, only breath. The lasagna steam made the windows fog, and through the fog I watched the world outside pretend nothing important was happening in here.
‚ÄúHow long?‚Äù I asked, and my voice had to climb a ladder to get out.
He swallowed. ‚ÄúSince the spring.‚Äù
It was October.
I nodded, because nodding is what people in stories do when the author runs out of verbs. The floor wasn‚Äôt a floor. I found a chair with the back of my knee and sat down before gravity remembered it had work.
Her name tumbled into the room like a glass tipped over. ‚ÄúWho is she?‚Äù
‚ÄúLena.‚Äù
Lena sounded like a bell. Like a river. Like something that belonged in a poem. I despised the name on sight.
He kept talking, careful, like each word he set down might explode. He said he hadn‚Äôt meant to. He said it surprised him too. He said he wanted to do this right. People love to talk about doing wrong things ‚Äúright.‚Äù
‚ÄúZoe?‚Äù I asked, because when you can‚Äôt hold your own life steady you reach for the small hand that makes sense.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs six,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll handle it. Together.‚Äù
The word together dropped between us like a bad joke. I could feel the heat of the lasagna against my wrist. I could feel the seam in the wooden table under my palm. I could feel the way my heart had started to punch through wallpaper.
‚ÄúDoes she know about me?‚Äù I asked.
He flinched as if the pronouns hurt. ‚ÄúLena knows. She‚Ä¶ she wants to meet you eventually. If you want.‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt,‚Äù I said. I didn‚Äôt know if I meant it.
He slept on the guest bed that night. I lay on ours and counted the places we‚Äôd put pictures and then taken them down. The empty hook over the dresser. The faint square where sunlight remembered a frame. Did we ever like color? Did we ever like any of this? The ceiling fan spun and spun, and I imagined letting it unscrew from the ceiling and crash so I could fix something that wasn‚Äôt my life.
In the morning I made oatmeal because that‚Äôs what six-year-olds eat when their world should stay the same. Zoe shuffled in with hair like a dandelion that had given up and asked if her rabbit could have a bow. I tied ribbon around one ear and she said, ‚ÄúDaddy, come look!‚Äù Evan came, in yesterday‚Äôs face, and looked, and I hated that he still smiled like the man I promised forever.
‚ÄúDaddy‚Äôs going to work early,‚Äù he said to Zoe.
‚ÄúYou always go to work early,‚Äù she said in the flat way kids say true things. ‚ÄúDo you want my strawberries?‚Äù
‚ÄúI want you to eat your strawberries,‚Äù he said, and kissed her head. The motion was muscle memory. He didn‚Äôt kiss mine.
Days became a choreography of avoidance. He showered at night; I showered in the morning. He used the front door; I used the back. He left notes about the plumber, the PTA bake sale, the dog food. Our sentences became receipts we signed without reading.
I didn‚Äôt ask to meet her. He didn‚Äôt push. But she developed in my mind anyway, like film in a dark room‚Äîtall, small, freckled, clean, with a mouth that looked good on a coffee cup. She wore linen. She laughed without showing too much teeth. She didn‚Äôt collect coupons with delight. She knew how to make a martini and keep succulents alive. In every version, she was the kind of woman who didn‚Äôt misplace tape.
The first time he said her name with the lights on, we were wiping down the counter. ‚ÄúI want Zoe to meet Lena,‚Äù he said. The sponge in my hand felt like a stone.
‚ÄúIs that what you want,‚Äù I said, because sometimes I try to make a question carry my anger.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs going to be in my life,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI want to do this‚Ä¶ slowly. Thoughtfully.‚Äù
‚ÄúThoughtfully,‚Äù I repeated, like he‚Äôd found the word under the fridge.
‚ÄúShe can meet her as a friend. A friend from the museum. We‚Äôll go to the park. Public. Together.‚Äù He glanced at me, then away. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be better if we do it as a team.‚Äù
‚ÄúTeam.‚Äù I rinsed the sponge. ‚ÄúBest for who?‚Äù
He didn‚Äôt answer.
I called my older sister, Bea, that night. Bea has a voice like a weighted blanket; you don‚Äôt crumble under it even when you want to. ‚ÄúCome over,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. Zoe‚Äôs asleep.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming there.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt ask permission. Bea doesn‚Äôt knock; she announces herself at the door like weather. She arrived with tea bags, a notepad, and a kind of dignity I wanted to borrow.
I told her everything in sentences so simple they felt like children‚Äôs blocks. Bea listened the way you build a fence‚Äîpost by post. She didn‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be okay,‚Äù because she hates lazy promises. She said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not alone,‚Äù and I believed her in the places I didn‚Äôt know belief could sit.
When Evan asked again about the park, I said yes. I said it because secrets breed in the dark. I said it because if I said no, he‚Äôd introduce them anyway, and I wanted to see her eyes when she looked at my daughter.
We picked Saturday. The sky thought about rain and then reconsidered. The park was full of dogs and ambition. Zoe ran to the swings in a jacket she refused to zip. Evan texted when they were almost there, because men love logistics when they can‚Äôt handle feelings.
They came up the path in a photo I would hate forever. Evan, too careful, shoulders pulled tight, one hand in his pocket, one hand at his side like he didn‚Äôt trust it. Beside him: Lena. She was not what I had imagined. She was not linen. She wore scuffed boots and a burnt orange scarf and a navy coat with a missing button. Her hair was pulled back in a way that said she had tried and then changed her mind. She looked like someone who had cried in cars and still tipped the barista.
‚ÄúHi,‚Äù she said, stopping a few feet from me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Lena.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt hold out her hand. I respected the mercy.
‚ÄúNora,‚Äù I said. My voice sounded like something that had been folded and unfolded too many times.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to meet you,‚Äù she said, and I saw it‚Äîthe shame like a small animal behind her ribs.
‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù I asked, not unkindly.
Evan cleared his throat, the universal signal for ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs pretend.‚Äù ‚ÄúZoe,‚Äù he called, ‚Äúcome say hi to my friend.‚Äù He swallowed the word new.
Zoe came with a swing‚Äôs momentum still in her knees. She stopped and looked at Lena from a safe distance. Lena crouched, not too close, and said, ‚ÄúI like your rabbit‚Äôs bow.‚Äù
‚ÄúHer name is Tulip,‚Äù Zoe said, with the loyalty given to stuffed things.
‚ÄúNice to meet you, Tulip,‚Äù Lena said, addressing the rabbit. I hated that she got that right. I hated that Lena didn‚Äôt perform. She listened. She let silence be a place instead of a test.
They built a lopsided sandcastle. Evan watched like he was guarding a border. I stood and watched them watch. When Evan went to get juice from the kiosk, Zoe looked up at Lena and asked with clean curiosity, ‚ÄúAre you my new mommy?‚Äù
Lena‚Äôs eyes widened, then softened. She didn‚Äôt look at Evan, who had stopped mid-step. She looked at me. ‚ÄúOh, sweetheart,‚Äù she said, still looking at me, ‚Äúno. You already have one. She‚Äôs right here.‚Äù
Zoe turned to me like a compass. ‚ÄúHi, Mommy,‚Äù she said, and I said, ‚ÄúHi, bug,‚Äù and the air came back into my body in a rude, grateful rush.
‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre done,‚Äù I said to Evan, because a truce should be short. He nodded. Lena stood, brushed sand off her knees, and said nothing else. She and I exchanged a look, something human enough I wished I hadn‚Äôt felt it.
We went home and resumed the work of pretending the house was a ship you could steer with lists. I wrote everything down because writing is how I believe things will behave. Grocery lists, dentist appointments, Zoe‚Äôs library day, Monday‚Äôs lasagna (never again), the marker that lived uninvited in the junk drawer. Lists kept me from screaming.
Two weeks later, he asked to ‚Äúrevisit our custody routine.‚Äù The phrase made me want to throw words at a wall. I said fine and added ‚Äúrevisit custody routine‚Äù to my notebook because if you write it, it‚Äôs less likely to swallow you.
He started taking Zoe Saturday afternoons. He texted too many updates, like a man auditioning for the role of reliable. Photos of Zoe on a carousel, Zoe holding a pretzel, Zoe‚Äôs shoes so muddy you could smell the childhood through the phone. Some weekends Lena wasn‚Äôt in the pictures. Some weekends she was a shadow at the edge of the frame. He sent these at even intervals as if time were a moral he could learn.
Zoe came back happy and sticky and loud. She didn‚Äôt mention Lena. She didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúnew mommy.‚Äù She did say the carousel horse she‚Äôd chosen was named Lightning and had a chipped ear. She told me a joke about bananas that had no punchline and I laughed anyway.
I thought I could survive that way: feed the dog, count the socks, breathe into a pillow when the house was empty, then brush my hair and take Zoe to school. Survival, I was learning, wears the same coat as denial.
Then the envelope came.
A courier. No return address. My name typed in a font that tried too hard to be official. Inside: a motion. Temporary custody hearing. Evan‚Äôs name and mine doing violence on the same line. Words that can ruin you: primary caregiver in dispute. Concern for stability. Interim order requested. The hearing set for Thursday at 9 a.m., as if that made it any more normal.
I read it. I read it again. The paper felt damp though it was dry. My mouth tasted like pennies.
When he came to pick up Zoe for dance class, I held the motion in my hand like a wounded thing. ‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù I asked.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what it sounds like,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúYou told a judge I‚Äôm unstable?‚Äù
He didn‚Äôt blink. ‚ÄúI told a judge you‚Äôre under strain. I told the truth.‚Äù
‚ÄúYour truth,‚Äù I said, because when you‚Äôve been cut open, accuracy matters. ‚ÄúWhy now?‚Äù
‚ÄúFor Zoe,‚Äù he said.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù I said, and felt my voice fill my bones, ‚Äúhide behind our child.‚Äù
For a second, the man I married looked out from behind whatever had replaced him. He flinched. Then he was new again‚Äîsmooth, reasonable, distant as a bank teller.
After he left, I called Bea and read sentences out loud until my throat wanted a lawyer. Bea stuffed a folder under her arm and arrived ten minutes later with her old friend Tamsin, who was a lawyer. Tamsin has a mind like a paper shredder and a heart that stays quiet while yours screams. She pulled out her yellow pad and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs list what we have, what we need, and what he thinks he has.‚Äù
We filled the table with calendars and messages and school flyers and pediatrician receipts and Zoe‚Äôs teacher‚Äôs emails that included words like ‚ÄúNora is always the one who‚Äù and ‚ÄúZoe told me her mom made flashcards for the winter performance.‚Äù We called my neighbor, Alma, who has eyes like real estate and sees everything. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been leaving at odd hours,‚Äù Alma said. ‚ÄúAnd he came home once‚Äîlate‚Äîand carried in a bag like tools. But the two-by-fours he loaded on the truck last month, those weren‚Äôt cut for anything useful. Men like to perform building,‚Äù she added, like a proverb.
At midnight, after Tamsin promised to draft a response before dawn and Bea fell asleep on the couch with Zoe‚Äôs rabbit under her hand, my phone lit with a message from an unknown number.
Nora, it‚Äôs Lena. I know this is unasked for. Can we talk? It‚Äôs about Evan. It‚Äôs about Zoe. Please.
I stared at the message until my eyes watered. I wrote What do you want?
She replied so quickly it felt like she‚Äôd been typing on the other side of my door. Ten minutes. Public place. Tomorrow morning, 7 a.m., Pine & Press. I won‚Äôt waste your time.
I showed Bea the screen. She didn‚Äôt wake fully, just opened one eye. ‚ÄúGo,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut text me the table number.‚Äù
Pine & Press at 7 a.m. is a collection of people who believe in the holiness of coffee. Lena sat in the corner with a paper cup between her hands like it was the only warm thing left in the world. She looked tired and older than last week and like someone who had started an apology and gotten lost. I stood in front of her and waited.
‚ÄúThank you for coming,‚Äù she said. We both winced at the politeness. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt make this longer than it has to be.‚Äù
I nodded at the chair. She nodded at me. We sat in our nods.
‚ÄúHe told me you were leaving him,‚Äù she said without dressing it up. ‚ÄúHe told me you wanted out, that you were‚Ä¶ cold. That you loved Zoe but didn‚Äôt want a marriage anymore. He said you were relieved he‚Äôd found someone who could make him happy and that you were grateful to be free.‚Äù She looked at me. ‚ÄúI believed him. That‚Äôs on me.‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt give her comfort. It wasn‚Äôt my job. I waited.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs changing,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOr maybe he was always this way and I just didn‚Äôt have the right lights on him.‚Äù She stared into her cup. ‚ÄúHe wants full custody. He said things about documenting you, about catching you upset with Zoe, about ‚Äòrevealing patterns.‚Äô He asked me to‚Ä¶ keep an eye and write things down.‚Äù
My face didn‚Äôt move. ‚ÄúDid you?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Her voice cracked. ‚ÄúBut I think he asked his cousin, Tyler. And he told me he‚Äôs installing an app on Zoe‚Äôs tablet that can‚Ä¶ record. He said it‚Äôs safety. He means leverage.‚Äù
I tasted iron. ‚ÄúWhy are you telling me?‚Äù
‚ÄúBecause I thought I was falling in love with a good man who made a bad choice,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think I might be falling out of love with a man who makes a lot of choices that feel like plans.‚Äù She swallowed. ‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôll do next, and because Zoe shouldn‚Äôt be a tactic.‚Äù
I should have stood up and walked away with dignity. I should have told her I didn‚Äôt need the other woman‚Äôs reluctant conscience. Instead I said, ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù because integrity doesn‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs dressed stupidly.
She slid a small notebook across the table. On the cover: paint flecks, a sticker from a hardware store, and a brown coffee ring. ‚ÄúDates he mentioned the hearing before you knew,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTimes he left to talk to a ‚Äòclient‚Äô and came back with a new phone. Notes I took when I realized I needed to keep my own record, even if I never used it. I don‚Äôt know if this helps you. It helps me to not be part of the worst version of this.‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt touch the notebook. I looked at it like it might ask me for a favor later. ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do?‚Äù I asked.
Her mouth tilted into a shape that wasn‚Äôt a smile. ‚ÄúGo home and tell him I won‚Äôt help. And then pack a bag.‚Äù
‚ÄúBe careful,‚Äù I said before I could swallow the care.
‚ÄúYou too,‚Äù she said.
For three days, the house pretended to be a house and not a trial exhibit. Evan was civil like a textbook. He brought Zoe back on time. He texted me photos of Lightning the carousel horse with a Band-Aid on his chipped ear. He asked if we could switch next Saturday because his parents wanted to see Zoe, and I said no because sometimes you can practice saying no on ordinary things to strengthen the muscle for when it matters.
On Thursday morning at 8:20 a.m., thirty minutes before the hearing, Evan texted: Running late. Car trouble. Will be there ASAP. Tamsin raised an eyebrow when I showed her. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not a man who runs late,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúInteresting.‚Äù
We walked into the courthouse with our folders and our faces that meant business. Bea handed me my game face like chapstick. ‚ÄúReapply as needed,‚Äù she said. We waited in the stale hallway that smelled like carpet cleaner and loss. Lawyers drifted past like different species of bird. Tamsin checked the time twice, then again, then tilted her head. 8:45. 8:53. 8:59. At 9:02, the bailiff called our case. Evan still wasn‚Äôt there.
The judge frowned into her computer. ‚ÄúWhere is Mr. Mercer?‚Äù she asked.
Tamsin stood. ‚ÄúYour Honor, my client informs me Mr. Mercer texted at 8:20 that he had car trouble and would be arriving shortly.‚Äù
The judge looked unimpressed. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll recess for ten minutes,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThen we proceed.‚Äù
The ten minutes were thirty. We went in without him. Tamsin, made for this battlefield, moved through her points with economy: primary caregiver evidenced by school records, medical appointments, teacher statements, neighbor testimony. She placed Lena‚Äôs notebook on the table like a quiet bomb. ‚ÄúWe also have reason to believe the father has been attempting to surveil the mother without her consent, via devices belonging to the child.‚Äù
The judge raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúEvidence?‚Äù
‚ÄúPending,‚Äù Tamsin said, ‚Äúbut we can offer caller logs, photographs of a second phone, and a witness who can testify to his statements.‚Äù
The judge nodded, made a note, and turned to me. ‚ÄúMs. Hayes, do you feel safe?‚Äù
‚ÄúI feel prepared,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúAnd scared.‚Äù
‚ÄúBoth can be true,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll set a temporary schedule today and a full hearing in six weeks. If Mr. Mercer fails to appear without good cause, we‚Äôll consider sanctions.‚Äù
At 9:52, my phone buzzed. A message from an unknown number, a photo loading. First grain, then shape. Evan‚Äôs car, blue Subaru, parked at an odd angle in the lot behind the courthouse. The windshield spidered. The side window shattered. In the driver‚Äôs seat, an empty coffee cup. On the ground beside the passenger door, a white envelope. On the envelope, my name.
The text below the photo: Don‚Äôt open it alone.
I‚Äôm not proud of what happened next. My hands forgot how to be hands. Tamsin took the phone from me, read, and said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in a movie.‚Äù But even she pack-ratted our papers faster than usual. We told the bailiff. He called someone with a voice like a ruled line. We walked out together into sun that had no right to be nice.
The lot behind the courthouse was simultaneously ordinary and wrong. Evan‚Äôs car looked like a person who had had a bad conversation. A police officer we hadn‚Äôt met yet met us there, his badge neat, his eyes already rehearsing gentleness. ‚ÄúJessica Hayes?‚Äù he asked me, and I had to correct him.
‚ÄúNora,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Nora.‚Äù
‚ÄúOfficer Calloway,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe got a call about a damaged vehicle. Must be yours.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my husband‚Äôs,‚Äù I said, and watched the word degrade in the air. ‚ÄúEvan Mercer.‚Äù
He nodded like he already knew. ‚ÄúIs he here?‚Äù
‚ÄúHe should be inside,‚Äù Tamsin said, scanning the pedestrians. ‚ÄúHe texted he‚Äôd be late.‚Äù
He wasn‚Äôt inside. He wasn‚Äôt here. He was very specifically nowhere, and the envelope lay in its rectangle of shadow like a dare. My name on it in his handwriting that made every application we ever filed look more respectable.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch that,‚Äù Officer Calloway said as I reached. ‚ÄúPhotographs first.‚Äù He pulled out his phone like a magic trick. He took pictures of everything‚Äîthe glass, the coffee cup, the smear on the rear bumper that might have been pollen or something that might mean something if you let it.

From the corner of my vision, Bea moved closer. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre shaking,‚Äù she whispered.
‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said. I needed my body to be a better container.
The officer squatted beside the envelope. ‚ÄúYou said you received a text about this?‚Äù he asked.
I nodded and showed him the number with no name. He wrote it down in neat print. ‚ÄúWho would send that,‚Äù I asked, ‚Äúif not Evan?‚Äù
‚ÄúPeople who want to help,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPeople who want to scare you.‚Äù He looked up. ‚ÄúPeople who want you to pick it up while I‚Äôm watching and then say you interfered.‚Äù
I took a step back. I wanted to be smart. I wanted to be lucky. I wanted to be wrong about everything.
At that moment, I became aware of the other sound in the lot‚Äîa phone ringing and ringing somewhere close, tinny and patient, like a child tapping your arm. It was coming from his car. The passenger door wasn‚Äôt quite shut. Through the glass, under the fractured light, a phone face glowed with the contact name LENA. The call ended. Then immediately began again.
Calloway saw it when I did. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move,‚Äù he said out of habit and then amended, ‚ÄúJust‚Äîcareful.‚Äù He reached and opened the passenger door with a handkerchief like the movies taught him. The phone stopped ringing as soon as the door opened, and then lit up again with a new text.

Hello everyone! I'm a recent computer engineering grad with 2 software engineering internships, 1 non-technical IT internship, and 5 years of retail pharmacy experience. My projects are mostly embedded systems/hardware focused with one software project. I'm targeting hardware/embedded systems engineer and software engineer positions across any type of company - I'm honestly desperate and open to any engineering role. I'm located in the DMV and willing to apply both locally and remotely, including relocation if needed. My main challenge is deciding what experiences and projects to include/remove for different types of roles. I'm unsure if my project portfolio is strong enough for hardware/embedded positions, or if my work experience alone qualifies me for software-specific openings. I recently discovered this subreddit and followed the ats templates but I'd like some advice to strategically tailor my resume content.  Please be brutally honest and direct with feedback - I'm open to major changes and happy to answer any clarifying questions about my background or target roles. \*Including my projects and IT internship descriptions in comment to avoid having post taken down for length\*:

The culprit was eventually arrested after both his family and his girlfriend reported him to the Police.

Regardless of what the shooter's political ideology was, and regardless of how politically or socially reprehensible Charlie Kirk's real or alleged political beliefs were, vigilante executions of political activists is inherently wrong. Not even the most evil, disgusting, morally reprehensible person you could imagine, one who can't even order a coffee at the local coffee shop without spouting offensive slurs, should have to live in fear of being killed without a trial because something he said offended the government or the public- that way lies Tyranny, *and Tyranny is the mother of all face-eating leopards*.

**REMEMBER: Demanding or celebrating the murder of people whose politics you don't like is a Rule 2 violation, and advocating for the extrajudicial killing of activists whose politics you don't like is a Rule 7 violation. Support of any ideology that espouses the murder of political opponents, or espouses rioting and looting as a form of political intimidation, is a Rule 7 violation and will be banned accordingly.**",1,1758425072.0,WildAutism,0,1.0,False

I have a few clients with a unique risk that run coffee shops out of their home. They are sole proprietors and don‚Äôt have employees. All coffee/baked goods are prepared in the home and customers simply message them (via social media) to place an order then arrange a pickup. None of the goods are consumed at the location. They obviously want to grow and the way in doing so is by attending events as vendors, being scheduled for company parties/ after church services, among other ways. Most opportunities will require them to have GL. Almost all vendor events I‚Äôve seen are requiring HNOA endorsements of $1mil. They also want them to obtain $5mil aggregate for injury/death/ pd. 

I‚Äôve asked Chat GPT and it says some of these requirements can typically be waived by the event with a formal acknowledgment signed by the vendor. Has anyone done so before and can provide guidance with this? Particularly the WC requirements and the $5mil limit. I have talked to multiple carriers, like Biberk, The Hartford, Chubb, Next all of which don‚Äôt have an appetite or can‚Äôt customize the policy to reach these high limits. Coterie is willing to take on the risk, but they can‚Äôt meet some of the other requirements. I found FLIP online and they seem like a good option for these clients, but again lack‚Äôs some customization requirements and don‚Äôt partner directly with brokers, it‚Äôs D2C. 

These clients are important to me, as I believe their businesses are scalable and we obviously can cross sell them on personal lines/ bigger more standard commercial lines when they truly establish themselves. So I don‚Äôt mind telling them FLIP is the way to go, but if someone out there has worked with this and can advise, it would be greatly appreciated.

I know the drill - mind your damn business, don‚Äôt make eye contact and all that. Tonight my friend and I were on 53rd street, and he accidentally bumped into a deranged man in a busy coffee shop. He apologized and moved out of his way, but the man proceeded to ask what his problem was, followed us outside and called him racial slurs and yelled all sorts of stuff.

Fortunately he just walked off ranting and raving to himself after we ignored him long enough. I just feel like at some point something like that might happen again, and I want to know if ignoring them really is the best way to go in most situations like that. With erratic unpredictable people, I can‚Äôt think of a better option. I‚Äôm not a large strong looking guy either, so I can‚Äôt be intimidating lol.",15,1758424179.0,AskNYC,15,0.78,False

He also kinda smells and doesnt have many social cues, which i didn‚Äôt tell him that ofc but i broke things off with him in person by telling him i cant fulfill his needs since my mom has been on me and tracking where ive been and whatnot. i ended up getting in a lot of trouble on thursday because i stayed out late (i was with him) and i realized that i can‚Äôt be sneaking around at my own risk. he said he understood and said he‚Äôd wait for me and asked if i would do the same. i told him with full honesty that i wouldn‚Äôt and i don‚Äôt expect him to wait for me either. his idea was after we graduate (in a year and a half) i can move out and finally be with him. he said that‚Äôs okay and i offered to still be friends as again we‚Äôre classmates and he said no.

i thought he handled it pretty well until he sent me so many messages. i was scared almost. we‚Äôve only known each other for 3 months and talked about being in a relationship for about a week. i was happy that a man was finally interested in me only for him to be like any other man. i felt like a toy almost. also when i told him told him thursday night that i got into a lot of trouble so i wasn‚Äôt able to see him tomorrow (i told him he could maybe get head because he kept asking) he ended up replying with just ‚Äúok‚Äù that message fed into my insecurity of being used. anyways i saw him in class yesterday and he looked horrible. i feel bad almost but i think i did the right thing ",0,1758423969.0,AmIOverreacting,9,0.5,False

¬†I'm always amused by the memories I have as a kid of watching shampoo commercials and wishing that could be me so badly..... Long before I would ever crack my egg.   In those years before I had figured out that those were not thoughts I was actually supposed to have.¬† ¬†In those years before those thoughts came with such a baggage of shame,¬†¬†I spent so much of my life wearing those high and tights that had come with being in an infantry unit, it's really nice to have hair, to feel its weight on my shoulders,¬† to go through that daily grounding routine of washing and conditioning,¬† The simple business of putting everything into a braid, The simple pleasure of liking who I am and who I'm trying to be for at least for a few minutes., reminder of why I chose this.

I¬†need those reminders,¬† ¬†The second I step out my door. I'll be confronted with how much this cost,¬† confronted with all those those facts of life that caused me to wonder if it was worth it.¬† ¬†To be honest,¬† I have so many days it's easier to say that it wasn't than it was.¬† ¬†So many days when The costs I have incurred to everyone else in my life make me feel incredibly guilty for this decision to pursue transition.¬† 

¬†It has been a year of bitter fruits,¬† some things like the weather and the price of grain and foreign trade policy are far out of my control,¬† I just simply have to live with the consequences.¬† It's the things that I have responsibility for that weigh so much more.¬† ¬†One of those costs of transition has been having to watch my parents consider having to sell their cows,¬† ¬†In some ways, it's the simple hardship that so many farm families have to go through, even when their kid isn't trans.¬† In our case,¬† we had expanded so the farm would be able to support multiple families.¬† ¬†Once upon a time,¬† the plan had been that when my parents decided to retire that my fiance would take over the management of the cows.¬† ¬†She was good at it,¬† incredibly intelligent, business savvy and a hell of a hand on a horse.¬† ¬†Her departure always meant that this day would come.¬† That there would come a day when we would be forced to realize that they couldn't keep doing things forever, and there wasn't enough of me to stretch over both the farming and the cows.¬† ¬† I didn't really want to give up the farming,..... So instead I get to start each day what's the business of watching my mother grieve the situation.¬† ¬†Those cows had been her entire life,¬†her pride,¬†her joy,¬†may be even more than her own children.¬† 

¬† There is such a heavy guilt that comes with being knowing that you are the one responsible for that grief and the end of those dreams,¬† ¬†Knowing that you were the one responsible for the fact that she can't look forward to watching her grandchildren chasing the descendants of the same critters that she had devoted her life to.  That this spring won't come with the joy of watching new born calves wobble onto their legs for that first drink of milk.  ¬†It may take a long time to get past that,¬† To be honest I'm not sure I ever will,¬† 

¬†There's so many days. I wish I could just enjoy actually being me,¬† ¬†without all of the costs attached to it.¬† But that's not the world I live in,¬† to be honest,¬† I'm not sure it's a world that has ever existed.¬† ¬†And yet for all the costs involved,¬† I am left with the realization that I can't imagine going back to being who I was before,¬† ¬†I have no desire to fit into that same mold,¬† ¬†there is only the realization that I wished I could have figured this out sooner,¬† figured it out well I still had time to deal with the heavy things,¬† before I'd spent so many years trapped in a self-imposed prison of misery.¬†¬†¬†The world in which we get to redo our life choices while retaining the wisdom gained from all of our bad experiences doesn't really exist either.¬† All we really get to do is keep putting one foot in front of the other,¬†¬†trying to do her best,¬†trying to treat others well.¬† ¬†Desperately hoping we still have something of worth to offer this world.¬†

 ¬†I spent the day poking wheat into the ground,¬†the slow business of a tractor rolling back and forth,¬†painting stripes in the oat stubble.¬† ¬†We were blessed with rain this last week,¬† it is so nice to actually be able to plant and moisture on time,¬† ¬†So much nicer than last year things were so dry that we didn't Even consider planning until it after it snowed for Thanksgiving.¬† ¬†Already some of the wheat is up in its neat little rows.¬† ¬†It's a miracle I may never get over seeing,¬† ¬†The miracle of watching little tiny seeds germinate and grow into plants,¬† ¬†The hope that always comes with emergence... The hope for a good harvest,¬† ¬† before the realities of weather and weeds and disease have demanded their tribute.¬† 

¬†Eventually the day grew to a close,¬†with long fingers of purple clouds set against a backdrop of pinks, oranges and yellows while the landscape underneath grew darker by the minute.¬† ¬†As I shut off the tractor and prepared to head for home, the calls of coyotes echoed against the hills hidden in darkness.¬† ¬†I took Time the time to grab some wild plums from one of the windbreaks that grew next to the field.¬† Right now they're perfect, ¬†that strange mixture of sweet tartness with a chalky aftertaste that last lasts long after you spit out the pit.¬† ¬†For some reason I love them. Maybe it's cuz they're a bit like my life and choosing to transition..... parts bitter,¬† parts tragic......and still somehow,¬† just a little bit beautiful and wonderful.

1nmh2d7,https://www.reddit.com/r/RingsofPower/comments/1nmh2d7/end_credit_song_ranking_from_worst_to_best/,End credit song ranking. From worst to best. (Strictly in my opinion!),"
So a while back, I made a list that was consisting of the many end credit songs throughout different forms of media of Middle-earth. I decided to make an updated list, this time with newer additions. Even spanning from a video game inspired by Tolkien lore. Now, chances are there is a song that I am missing. But I believe that I have listened to and ranked all of the ending songs that stick out the most. Also, the list consists of songs with lyrics, so instrumentals do not count. Also, I can‚Äôt stretch this enough. Allow me to place this crucial bit in all caps. Hopefully to ensure that there are no other loose ends to tie. Anyways, as said in the title, this order in which these songs stand in, ARE JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION! Odds are, there is a song on my list that‚Äôs your favorite or least favorite. So fill free to let me know, but please be civil about it. I don‚Äôt want to start any arguments, or step on too many toes as I already am. Another thing, the songs throughout are from three different forms of media. Films, video games, and TV. Yeah. I know, it‚Äôs taboo to talk about ‚Äúyou know what,‚Äù but when we get there, just hear me out. This list will also be going from worst to best. Again, in terms of preference. So, here we go. Oh! Before I forget! Another note, I do know that there are many writers who had a hand with the song. I‚Äôm merely focusing on the artists who sing them, but I will bring up the writers in most if not all of the entries. Alright, with that addressed, let‚Äôs begin. 


12. The Ballad of Damrod: by Jens Kidman. Now, if there is one thing that Ring of Power does right, from the very start, it‚Äôs the music. Bear McCreary has a very vast grasp on what makes great Middle-earth music. Doesn‚Äôt help that prior to his inclusion, he was also the composer of both the new God of War games. Not to mention we get the legendary Howard Shore to compose the opening theme. I tend to listen to the soundtracks often when I am just sitting at home relaxing, or doing other activities like cleaning the house. Obviously, I listen more of Howard Shore‚Äôs masterpieces from all six films, but Bear is among the library as well. Unfortunately not all of Bear‚Äôs works are a hit. 
I‚Äôve talked about this one in the past, that while I do like the music itself, I can‚Äôt say for the vocals. I love some rock, I can even like heavy rock. But not when the singer sounds like he is getting over a sickness! The singer sounds like he has throat cancer or something! When a rock song does that type of vocalization, I check out. It‚Äôs fine if it‚Äôs done for a little while, just not the whole thing. Which is a shame, because the song starts out really well, and seeing as Professor Tolkien has been a huge inspiration for rock and roll as a whole, you‚Äôd think doing a rock song featuring Middle-earth would be genius! Which it is, but what matters is the execution. For me, the execution just isn‚Äôt there. 

11. Gollum‚Äôs Song: by Emiliana Torrini. Oh boy. I just know I‚Äôm pissing someone off. But truth be told, out of the 6 live action films, this was always my least favorite. I don‚Äôt know why. I mean, the orchestral score by Howard is chilling, beautiful even. The vocals of Torrini are haunting, and hypnotic even. Fran Walsh does a fantastic job in writing the song, but for some reason, this is the one I listen to the least; film credit songs that is. I‚Äôve spent years wondering why that was, and I still don‚Äôt have a definitive answer to that! Maybe because when I first heard the song, I watched the music video, and remembered being confused on what the song was about. Yeah. Imagine, but I was like seven, so cut me some slack. Also the fact that I would constantly listen to the number one song many times(no spoilers just yet,) Gollum‚Äôs Song just felt inferior in comparison. But, I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get the definitive answer to this, and maybe, it‚Äôs best if I didn‚Äôt. Keep in mind, I‚Äôm not saying that this is a bad song! Far from it! But compared to the other five songs from the saga, this one just isn‚Äôt my cup of tea. 

10. Fires of War: by Kelli Schaefer. The newest placement in my list, and it comes from the sequel to one of my all-time favorite games. Shadow of War was, and still is, a very odd game for me. Like, it does a lot of questionable stuff when it comes to the writing and the lore, sexy Shelob is the prime example of that. As someone who played through and adores Shadow of Mordor, I will say that I was disappointed that that game didn‚Äôt have a credit song, that wasn‚Äôt mainly orchestral. But after playing through Shadow of War, when I heard the ending song, I was both amazed, and glad that the minor nitpick was fixed. Now, truth be told, I haven‚Äôt listened to it that much, heck, Gollum‚Äôs Song got more plays. But I have to say, out of the two, though despite not listening to as often as the other songs, it just fits more at home with me. Maybe because it‚Äôs my love for the first game, and my satisfaction of finishing the second one, completing Talion‚Äôs story, maybe it‚Äôs the vocals of Kelli, or the lyrics and music written and composed by Nathan Grigg. I can‚Äôt quite put my finger on it. If I were to give an answer, it would be a mix of both. As said, I love the first game to death, even though like any game, there are admittedly parts that piss me off,(not as much as Shadow of War though,) so hearing the lyrics with the score that reflect the struggles of Talion just resonated with me more. 

9. I See Fire: by Ed Sheeran.
I love Ed Sheeran. The very first song recall hearing of him was I See Fire. That very first time came from that fateful Christmas Day when I went to see The Desolation of Smaug with my Dad as a present. Got the tickets in a Gandalf bookmark too! Needless to say, that was a great Christmas for me! So when the credits started rolling and the song played, I wanted to listen to the whole thing, but my Dad just wanted to go home. So I went home and listened to it on YouTube. Since then, it is a go-to song for me whenever I am out and about. With that said, I See Fire kind of sticks out. What I mean is that the other songs have a certain feel to them, like they‚Äôre in a uniform which reflects that they are songs meant to represent the Tolkien universe, while Ed‚Äôs still does this just fine, I feel it does it less than the others. Even Gollum‚Äôs Song did that better, admittedly. But then again, maybe that‚Äôs why I like it so much. Because it sticks out. Regardless, it helped introduce me to a man with great talent, and I honestly, wouldn‚Äôt change that for the all the gold in the world. 

8. This Wandering Day: by Janet Roddick. Now, I wasn‚Äôt going to include this in my list, as it was featured in the Rings of Power episode, Partings. As Poppy would sing it throughout the Journey. But that changed when a user showed me that another singer had sang it during the end credits. Obviously the singer was better in the end, but Poppy‚Äôs actress(whose name escapes me,) did fine for what she was given. Oddly, this was one of the few times in Season One where it felt like it was a proper welcome back to Middle-earth. What makes it even more shocking was that it was written by J.D. Payne, one of the showrunners. One of the few times that Tolkien had a small chance shined through in his writing, and, he actually did a decent job. While not perfect, I do find myself listening to either version. Even more so with the cover by Colm McGuiness, and his duet with Jax the Bard. That one I have listened to many times over. They have such great voices, and I highly recommend that you give it a listen to. But with that said, This Wandering Day, a shining moment from a Tolkien adaptation that‚Ä¶well, is incredibly flawed. To put it in the nicest way I can. I know a lot of people here hate it, but personally, I just find it, meh. But even so, I still choose to just listen to the soundtracks. Those will always be a treat to me. Still, not near the majesty of Howard, but still good. 

7. The Rider: by Paris Paloma.
This one I have been wanting to listen to for a while. Finally got around to last week. When I was sitting down at my local bookstore, and just enjoying my day. Writing down notes, and taking in the atmosphere. There‚Äôs a little space you can sit in and rest by a fake fireplace, while reading a book, or just drinking some coffee. Anyway, I‚Äôm getting off track. I saw that the Rider was on the list on YouTube, and since I have been looking to listen to it, basically since War of the Rohirrim came out, I decided to give it a go. I‚Äôm very glad I did. The vocals of Paris really do feel as though one of Rohan was singing. The music itself is nice. As all Middle-earth music would naturally be. Phoebe Gittins and David Long did a good job as writers for the song. The only real thing is that holds it back for me, is that I really need to listen to it more for it to really stick with me. Also doesn‚Äôt help that I still need to watch the film, which I look to fix this coming Tolkien week. So maybe in the future, this song will reach higher onto my list. But will it reach the top five? Personally no. Because I love those songs way more, as they hold deeper to me, not to mention that the very four in question have remained firm in their place for years. Frankly, I don‚Äôt think that will chance. Number 5, well, time will have to be the judge. 

6. Where The Shadows Lie: by Fiona Apple. 
You know, when I first watched Season one of ROP, I kept saying to myself after like the first episode, ‚ÄúThis is supposed to be a Lord of the Rings show, right?‚Äù All I was getting was that it was trying to be‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶whatever it was trying to be. Wheels of Time? Maybe the Witcher? I don‚Äôt know. But aside from a few moments where it did shine through that this was meant to be an adaptation of Tolkien‚Äôs work, I felt lost many other times. But as soon as the last episode played, and Sauron returns to Mordor, and the Three Rings are made, the credits roll, and then it starts to feel like Lord of the Rings! All thanks to the ending song, sung by Fiona Apple. Who did a nice rendition of the One Ring Poem. I can‚Äôt complain about the lyrics of the song, because it‚Äôs word from word the poem written by Professor Tolkien! So the lyrics are solid. The music, once more by Bear, is chilling, foreboding, and a signal for the worst events in the Second Age are about to begin. Fiona brings a performance that is decently reflecting that. Once again, the music comes to the rescue for the show, this time, Tolkien‚Äôs lyrics are a skeletal structure. 

5. Old Tom Bombadil: by Rufus Wainwright.
Season two, was definitely an improvement over Season 1. My Dad and I watched it when it came out and we both found it to be more enjoyable; as it felt more like Lord of the Rings, compared to whatever Season 1 was trying to be. I feel that it was really a case of missing identity. While the identity for season isn‚Äôt all there, I can at least say that it was a more fitting welcome back to Middle-earth. Although, it was still riddled with issues. Some I‚Äôd rather NOT talk about, due to disgust, and stupidity. If you know, you know. But I digress, the first thing I did in preparation to Season two was listen to the music. When I heard that Tom Bombadil was finally getting adapted in another form that wasn‚Äôt a video game, and after over twenty years of images of what could have been in the Peter Jackson films, I was intrigued. Not excited, or angry, just intrigued. Then I looked up Tom Bombadil online to see if any new information was out, and I saw the song on YouTube. I clicked on it, and learned that singer Rufus Wainwright was singing it. I must admit, he was an actual good fit to sing a song written by Tolkien. Though the lyrics were combined from other songs that Tom sung in the books, I didn‚Äôt mind. Because I just loved hearing Rufus‚Äô voice, and to hear more of Tolkien‚Äôs lyrics sung, was always a treat. I have to say, out of all of the songs that ROP released with lyrics, Old Tom Bombadil is the one I visit the most. Because I just love the lyrics, because of course, the music, once more by McCreary who just kills it, and Wainwright‚Äôs singing, as I used to love Hallelujah as a kid. So yeah. This is the ROP song I‚Äôve heard the most, and in my opinion, the best of the four. 

4. Song of the Lonely Mountain(film version): by Neil Finn. 
It was in April of 2013, it was a rainy day, and both me and my Dad were at home. He comes to my room and asks me if I wanted to rent a movie from Redbox, so we go to Wal-Mart, and we find that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was available to rent. We missed out on seeing it that previous year, so I immediately jumped at the chance to rent it. In the end, my dad and I watched it twice that night. A wonderful welcome back to the land of Middle-earth. Not to mention, this was officially where I wanted to read the books. I found a copy of The Hobbit at a further Wal-Mart, bought it, and I was hooked. As of today, The Hobbit is the only novel I have ever read twice! That is another reason why I hold An Unexpected Journey close to my heart. It was a mix of fond memories of my past, making new ones with my father, and it helped me become a bigger fan of Professor Tolkien‚Äôs mythology. It also inspired me to create my own fantasy worlds. But that‚Äôs a topic for another day. Back to the song. I actually heard it through when I watched the film with my granny one day when I went to spend the day with her. Long story. So as the credits rolled, I sat in silence, and listened to the song. Since then, Song of the Lonely Mountain became the end credit song of Middle-earth that has been replayed on my music lists for years. Second to only my number one favorite. I love Neil‚Äôs vocals, the background vocals, which I‚Äôve heard were done by his sons,(which makes it even better in my opinion)the music once more done by Howard Shore, the fact that it matches the same melody as Misty Mountains Cold in the film(one of my favorite parts by the way,)and the lyrics. Now, I mainly speak of the film version.‚Äôfor the soundtrack has this echo when Neil sings, and it doesn‚Äôt have that orchestral beginning like in the credits. I don‚Äôt think have much to complain about aside from the difference in versions. Nothing more to say, just that I adore the song, but I love the top three just a bit more. But hey! Still the second most listened song of the list. That‚Äôs still something to be proud of. 

3. Into The West: by Annie Lennox. 
Ah. Annie Lennox. I adore her voice. From Sweet Dreams, Here Comes the Rain Again, and Love Song for a Vampire. She has such an amazing talent, and is on my list as being one of my favorite singers. When I learned that it was she who sung Into The West, I have to be honest, being a kid, I never put it together. But as I got older, and learned it was her, I listened to the song once more, like actually listened to it, and like her other works of art, I was enchanted. There is no wonder as to why this song one the Oscar for best song back in 2004. All in thanks to the writing talent of Annie, and the lovely Fran Walsh, as well as the music composed by Howard. Used throughout sections of such a masterpiece of cinema, yes. Now, while not my number one favorite song, I still love it, and personally, it was really close for the last three. For Annie, I was just listening to it over and over last week. I don‚Äôt think I have anything bad to say about the song. It‚Äôs a masterpiece, through and through. 

2. The Last Goodbye: by Billy Boyd. 
It‚Äôs Billy Boyd! Pippin, who sings the song to close out the saga! Like, come on! Billy has already shown he has a great voice in Return of the King, so of course it only made sense to give him a full length song! It also helps that he helped Fran and Philippa write it! I had to stop myself from leaving the theater when my Dad and I went to see The Battle of the Five Armies that very year. It was going to be another Christmas present, but neither Mom and Dad knew if they would be able to get tickets for Christmas Day. But when I was watching the credits, and I heard the song, I literally murmured to myself, ‚ÄúPippin.‚Äù Of course the thought was correct as moments later after the cast was shown, it showed that Billy Boyd was indeed singing. As I went home, I went to YouTube, found the music video, and was in tears, not only did it have Billy singing like an angel once more, but the video played clips from all six of the films. Locations, characters, behind the scenes moments from the crew, and when it ended with Billy singing, ‚ÄúI bid you all, a very fond farewell,‚Äù no lie, I teared up. To so many, like myself, this felt like it was indeed the last goodbye, and we could close that very chapter in our lives. Seems silly to think of it like this now, but back then, this truly felt like the very end of Middle-earth. So for the past two years, as I would allow the end credit songs to play, I also like to add The Last Goodbye music video to my watch list, as a way to say goodbye to Middle-earth, until next time. To me, it just makes my marathon a little more special, and I intend to do so again this year! Oh, I can‚Äôt wait! Tolkien week Can‚Äôt get there sooner!! 

1. May It Be: by Enya. 
The gold standard to what songs of Middle-earth should be. Or at least in my honest to Eru opinion. Let me go back to the past, and unlock a memory of my childhood. When I was a kid, wee boy, my older sister and I were talking to ourselves after watching the Lord of the stings for what felt like the thousandth time. So, we decide rondo something different. We went to the second disc of the Fellowship of the Ring DVD, and found the bonus features, we found the music video of May It Be, I was immediately in love with such a magical song. From the lyrics, the melody, and of course Enya‚Äôs unworldly voice which lifted my very spirit. Which for a six year old child, this was rare. Out of all the credit songs, this is the one I listened to the most, the one that captured my heart, and became what I feel all of the songs should strive to be. It just clicks all of the boxes for me. Not to mention the fact that I believe this is where my love for Celtic and New-Age singers began to blossom. But I digress. Beautifully written by Enya herself, with additional aid from Roma Ryan to boot! Like Into the West, this song is just flawless, at least in my opinion. It‚Äôs a freaking masterpiece and it really should have won the Oscar as well. Randy Newman, nothing personal, but If I didn‚Äôt Have You was no where near an Oscar worthy song in comparison to May It Be. But I digress, another thing I used to do is listen to it before I went to sleep when I uploaded it to my mp3 player, many years later. It is such a soothing piece that can make anyone dream such wonderful things. It also soothes my anger whenever something gets me riled. Like, I swear they use this song in therapy sessions. Another thing that makes this song so great, is that it has great covers. One specifically is an acapella piece performed by Peter Hollens, with the addition violin by Taylor Davis. If I‚Äôm not listening to Enya‚Äôs rendition, the Peter is there is enchanting me with his own great talent. I highly recommend you check that cover out if you haven‚Äôt already. It‚Äôs a masterpiece in its own right. Especially at the second chorus. That is my favorite part of that performance. Another thing I nearly forgot to add was complementing Nick Ryan for composing the song, and of course, our dear Howard Shore for conducting it with the London Philharmonic Orchestra of all things. That is truly the cherry on top of such a beautiful cake that shall live on for years to come. 

So, there we have it! All of the Middle-earth related credit songs from worst to best, in my opinion. What are your favorite or least favorite songs? Let me know, and remember, this is just my personal opinion. So please do not take any of this post to heart. I merely wanted to share another thing I love about the world of Tolkien. Also, if you do decide to reply, please don‚Äôt be a jerk about it. I just want to have a nice conversation free from any drama and chaos. With that said, comment below, and let me know.

1nmh2af,https://www.reddit.com/r/NiceVancouver/comments/1nmh2af/can_anyone_help_me/,Can anyone help me?,"My life is falling apart. One year ago I had my dream life. I was making $140k a year while working remotely 20 hrs a week, married to the love of my life, and travelling the world. Then suddenly I was let go from my job because of industry changes. As a contractor I wasn‚Äôt eligible for EI or severance.

Shortly after, I found out I‚Äôm pregnant with my 3rd baby. I was excited but scared since I‚Äôm now making $40k a year, and as a contractor, I‚Äôm not eligible for maternity leave. My husband assured me we would be ok and he would take care of us. But then he lost his job too!! 

We lost our insurance benefits from his work, he had to stop taking very important meds, and I had to stop going to much needed therapy. This led to both of us going a little crazy and some very toxic moments. We‚Äôre now taking a break from our relationship indefinitely. 

Our baby will be here soon and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do. I‚Äôm barely scraping by. I don‚Äôt have enough for my basic necessities and there‚Äôs nothing left over to even get a coffee or go out to eat with friends. How the f am I going to afford another baby!! And how am I going to work at the same time??? Luckily I work remotely but my work is very focused and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to do it.

1nmh1el,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SecureRich1212/comments/1nmh1el/the_best_colognes_for_men/,The Best Colognes for Men,"Finding the right cologne is one of those weirdly personal things that feels way more complicated than it should. Some scents hit instantly and feel like they were made for you, while others you spray once and know you‚Äôll never touch again. Over the years, I‚Äôve gone through bottles that felt like a part of my identity, and others that made me wonder what I was even thinking at the time. What I‚Äôve learned is that the best colognes aren‚Äôt about being the strongest or trendiest, they‚Äôre about finding something that matches your vibe and sticks with you in different moments of your life.

Woody, citrusy, musky, or spicy, it doesn‚Äôt really matter the family as much as how it feels when you wear it. The right one almost blends into the background until someone notices and says, ‚Äúyou smell good.‚Äù That‚Äôs when you know you found a keeper. Here are a few that I‚Äôve either worn or tested enough times to actually talk about how they feel in real life.

## üèÜ Best Overall Option: [Le Labo Th√© Matcha 26 EDP](https://productbible.com/blog/best-colognes-for-men#le-labo-the-matcha)

Th√© Matcha 26 has this understated, calming vibe that feels almost like a personal ritual. When you first spray it, you get a soft blend of matcha and fig that‚Äôs creamy but never heavy. Then the woods slide in quietly, balancing everything so it feels smooth and grounded. It‚Äôs not one of those scents that fills the room, you really notice it when someone‚Äôs within arm‚Äôs reach, and that‚Äôs what makes it special.

I started wearing this on lazy weekend mornings when I‚Äôd head out for a coffee or sit with a book. It‚Äôs the kind of scent that fits perfectly into that slower pace, almost like it‚Äôs syncing with your mood. One time I wore it to a small dinner, and someone leaned in while we were talking and said, ‚Äúyou smell like something familiar, but I can‚Äôt place it.‚Äù That‚Äôs exactly the effect this fragrance has, it doesn‚Äôt shout, but it lingers.

A lot of people hype Santal 33 from Le Labo, but I think Th√© Matcha 26 is the smarter choice. Santal can be almost too recognizable now, but this one feels like it belongs just to you. The matcha makes it soothing, the fig gives it a subtle sweetness, and the woods keep it sophisticated. It‚Äôs not trying to be sexy or loud, yet it ends up being both in its own way.

If you‚Äôre someone who doesn‚Äôt want to announce your presence with a scent but still likes the idea of leaving a quiet impression, this one nails it. Over time, it grew on me so much that it became my go-to ‚Äúreset‚Äù fragrance, something I‚Äôd wear when I wanted to feel like myself again.

## üï∂Ô∏è Best Classic Option: [Ralph Lauren Polo EDT](https://productbible.com/blog/best-colognes-for-men#ralph-lauren-polo-edt)

Polo EDT takes me back to being a teenager trying to smell grown-up. My uncle wore it religiously, and one time before a wedding I snuck a spray, hoping it would make me look older than fifteen. The pine, leather, and tobacco combo was way too much for me then, but now I get why people love it, it‚Äôs bold, unapologetic, and has this rugged masculinity baked in.

Wearing it now feels like putting on a vintage leather jacket. There‚Äôs something comforting about how it hasn‚Äôt really changed over the years. I wore it once on a fall hike just out of curiosity, and it weirdly matched the vibe of the woods around me, the pine and earthiness blending right in with the scenery. It‚Äôs that outdoorsy confidence bottled up.

The thing about Polo EDT is that it‚Äôs versatile in a surprising way. It‚Äôs strong, yes, but it doesn‚Äôt feel out of place in more polished settings. I wore it to a semi-formal work dinner once, and instead of feeling too loud, it gave off a confident edge that actually worked in my favor. People noticed, but it wasn‚Äôt overpowering.

Even though newer Polo releases have come and gone, this one still feels relevant. It‚Äôs got history, but it hasn‚Äôt aged badly. To me, it‚Äôs one of those scents worth revisiting if you‚Äôve only ever associated it with older generations.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Best Long-Lasting Option: [Tom Ford Beau de Jour EDP](https://productbible.com/blog/best-colognes-for-men#tom-ford-beau-de-jour)

Beau de Jour is like a time machine back to the barbershop scents, but Tom Ford makes it feel modern and polished. Lavender opens the show, sharp and clean, then it eases into rosemary, patchouli, and moss. What I love is that it doesn‚Äôt just fade into the background after an hour, it sticks with you for the long haul.

I wore this to a wedding last year, sprayed it on around noon, and by midnight people were still catching whiffs of it. For me, that‚Äôs a big deal because most colognes fade too fast, and I hate carrying bottles for touch-ups. It just holds its ground without turning stale.

Another time, I wore it to a regular day at the office, and it gave me this low-key sense of being sharper than I was. Like, deadlines were piling up, I was tired, but something about Beau de Jour kept me feeling composed. That quiet boost is what makes it worth it.

It‚Äôs not the most daring scent out there, but it doesn‚Äôt need to be. It‚Äôs timeless, masculine, and dependable. If you want something that can carry you through a busy day without reapplying, this is the one I‚Äôd recommend.

## üå´Ô∏è Best Subtle Option: [Escentric Molecules Molecule 01 EDT](https://productbible.com/blog/best-colognes-for-men#molecule-01-edt)

Molecule 01 is unlike anything else I‚Äôve tried. The first time I sprayed it, I thought it was broken, like, ‚Äúis this even doing anything?‚Äù But then, half an hour later, someone sitting next to me asked what I was wearing. That‚Äôs when I realized the magic isn‚Äôt about what _you_ smell, but how other people pick it up around you. It‚Äôs subtle, like a quiet aura that hovers close to your skin.

I wore it a lot during work-from-home days, when I didn‚Äôt feel like putting on a big statement fragrance but still wanted something to make me feel put together. It became a little personal hack: even though I could barely smell it myself, it gave me this odd boost of confidence knowing that others noticed. It‚Äôs the cologne equivalent of looking sharp on Zoom even though you‚Äôre wearing sweatpants below the camera.

The coolest part is that it doesn‚Äôt smell the same on everyone. I lent it to a friend once, and on them it had this warm, almost cedar-like vibe, while on me it was more airy and musky. That unpredictability makes it fun, it‚Äôs like a scent that collaborates with your own skin chemistry instead of fighting against it.

Some people say they can‚Äôt smell it at all, and that‚Äôs true. There were times I thought it had disappeared until someone commented on it. But that‚Äôs part of its charm. It‚Äôs almost like an inside joke between you and whoever notices. If you want something loud, this isn‚Äôt it. But if you like the idea of a ‚Äúno-fragrance fragrance,‚Äù it‚Äôs hard to beat.

## üë• Best Unisex Option: [Calvin Klein CK One EDT](https://productbible.com/blog/best-colognes-for-men#calvin-klein-ck-one)

CK One was one of the first colognes I ever bought with my own money, back in college. The frosted glass bottle sat on every roommate‚Äôs dresser, and it just worked no matter who wore it. It opens bright with citrus and green tea, and then smooths into a light musk that feels clean and approachable. It‚Äôs not flashy, but it‚Äôs incredibly versatile.

I used to wear it daily, class in the morning, hanging out in the afternoon, maybe a date in the evening. It was the definition of a ‚Äúsafe bet.‚Äù You never had to worry about overdoing it, and people consistently said it smelled fresh and easygoing. For someone just starting to experiment with fragrance, it was the perfect entry point.

One of my favorite memories tied to CK One was sharing it with a partner. We‚Äôd both spray it before going out, and it smelled slightly different on each of us. That unisex quality makes it kind of fun, it‚Äôs like sharing a hoodie or a playlist. It‚Äôs simple, but in the best way.

Even now, when I‚Äôve collected more ‚Äúniche‚Äù bottles, I still respect CK One. It‚Äôs timeless in a way, the kind of scent you don‚Äôt outgrow because it‚Äôs not trying too hard. It pairs just as well with a hoodie and sneakers as it does with a crisp white button-up. Sometimes you don‚Äôt need complexity, you just want something that feels like you.

## üå≤ Best Woody Option: [Herm√®s Terre d‚ÄôHerm√®s Eau Intense V√©tiver EDP](https://productbible.com/blog/best-colognes-for-men#terre-dhermes-intense-vetiver)

Terre d‚ÄôHerm√®s Eau Intense V√©tiver feels like stepping outside on a cool morning when the air is crisp and grounding. The vetiver gives it this earthy backbone, while citrus and mineral notes keep it from being too heavy. It‚Äôs a perfect blend of rugged and refined, and that balance is what keeps me coming back to it.

I first wore this regularly during a stretch when I was commuting downtown every day. There was something about the scent that made the morning train rides less chaotic, it felt like armor, but in a quiet way. Not intimidating, just composed. It‚Äôs the kind of scent that makes you feel like you‚Äôve got your stuff together even if your inbox is a disaster.

What impresses me is its versatility. I‚Äôve worn it on hikes, to work meetings, and even to a formal dinner, and it felt appropriate in all those settings. That‚Äôs rare for colognes, which often lean too casual or too dressed-up. This one threads the needle effortlessly.

If I had to recommend a ‚Äúforever fragrance,‚Äù this might be it. I‚Äôve burned through bottles faster than almost any other scent, and I don‚Äôt regret a drop. It feels like one of those colognes you could hand down to someone and they‚Äôd instantly get why it‚Äôs a classic.

## üå∂Ô∏è Best Spicy Option: [Dior Sauvage Elixir Parfum](https://productbible.com/blog/best-colognes-for-men#dior-sauvage-elixir)

Sauvage Elixir is Sauvage turned up to eleven. The spices hit you right away, cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and then the lavender and woods settle in to keep it grounded. It‚Äôs powerful, no question, but that‚Äôs what makes it exciting. I wore it to a rooftop bar once, and within fifteen minutes two different people asked me what I had on.

It‚Äôs definitely a cooler-weather scent. I tried it once in the summer, and it was way too much. But in the fall or winter, especially at night, it shines. It‚Äôs bold enough to cut through the chill and feels warm and inviting without being cloying. One spray is plenty though, any more and you risk overwhelming people.

The licorice-like edge in this scent is what keeps it memorable. It‚Äôs not just another spicy cologne; it has a twist that makes you stop and think about it. It‚Äôs mysterious in a way, almost like it leaves a trail that makes people want to follow.

For me, it‚Äôs not an everyday scent, it‚Äôs a ‚Äúspecial occasion‚Äù one. Dates, parties, nights where you want to feel magnetic. It‚Äôs the cologne equivalent of putting on your best jacket and knowing you‚Äôre about to have a good night.

## üß• Best Leather Option: [Malin + Goetz Leather EDP](https://productbible.com/blog/best-colognes-for-men#malin-goetz-leather)

Malin + Goetz Leather is leather, but not in the usual heavy, smoky way. Instead, it‚Äôs smooth, with floral and spicy notes that lighten it up. The first time I wore it was to a casual dinner, and I remember being surprised how easy it was to pull off in warm weather. It didn‚Äôt feel stuffy or too serious, it just worked.

I think of this one as a modern leather fragrance. Traditional leather scents can feel dated or overpowering, but this one has just enough polish to be versatile. I‚Äôve worn it to the bar, to run errands, and even once to a family gathering, and in all cases it felt appropriate. That‚Äôs rare for leather scents, which usually scream ‚Äúnight out.‚Äù

What‚Äôs nice is that it still carries that confidence leather is known for. It‚Äôs bold enough to turn heads but not so strong that you‚Äôre clearing rooms. It has that rugged backbone, but softened edges that make it more approachable.

This is the fragrance I‚Äôd recommend if you‚Äôve ever been curious about leather but afraid it‚Äôd be too much. It‚Äôs bold enough to feel special, but never crosses into intimidating.

## üêæ Best Musk Option: [Fr√©d√©ric Malle Musc Ravageur EDP](https://productbible.com/blog/best-colognes-for-men#frederic-malle-musc-ravageur)

Musc Ravageur is a powerhouse of musk, spice, and vanilla, and it‚Äôs unapologetically sensual. The first time I tried it, it felt like too much, but then as it settled, I understood why people love it. It‚Äôs rich, warm, and has this magnetic quality that makes people want to lean closer.

I wore it one winter night out of curiosity, and it immediately clicked. The cold air seemed to amplify its warmth, and it felt like wearing an invisible blanket. Later that night, someone actually asked what I was wearing because they couldn‚Äôt stop noticing it, it‚Äôs that kind of scent.

This isn‚Äôt one for the office, at least not for me. It feels too intimate for professional settings. But on dates or nights out, it‚Äôs perfect. It‚Äôs got a depth and complexity that makes it stand out in a world of fresh, safe colognes.

What I appreciate most is that it‚Äôs not loud for the sake of it. It projects, yes, but in a way that feels like an invitation rather than a demand. It‚Äôs confident, complex, and just a little dangerous, the kind of cologne that makes memories.",1,1758423654.0,u_SecureRich1212,0,1.0,False

1nmh0hp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1nmh0hp/sycamore_row_john_grisham_jake_brigance_series/,Sycamore Row ‚Äì John Grisham (Jake Brigance Series Book 2),"Hello everyone,

I've just finished diving into [Sycamore Row ‚Äì John Grisham (Jake Brigance Series Book 2)](https://pdfhive.com/sycamore-row-john-grisham/), and I wanted to share my honest thoughts with you, almost like we're just chatting over coffee. If you're a fan of legal dramas or just a good story with plenty of twists, you're in for a treat with this one.

**A Quick Look (No Spoilers, I Promise!)**

""Sycamore Row"" picks up a few years after the first Jake Brigance book, ""A Time to Kill,"" but you don't necessarily need to have read the first to enjoy this one. The story kicks off in 1988 in the fictional town of Clanton, Mississippi, when a wealthy, ailing old man decides to shock everyone by leaving his massive fortune not to his estranged children, but to his Black housekeeper. Naturally, this ignites a fierce legal battle, bringing racial tensions simmering beneath the surface to a full boil. Our familiar lawyer, Jake Brigance, finds himself once again caught in the middle, trying to honor the deceased's last wishes against a tide of public opinion and legal challenges.

**What Really Stood Out For Me**

*   **The Story's Heart:** What I truly appreciated was how Grisham delves into complex themes like race, justice, and the deep-seated prejudices that can linger in a community. It‚Äôs not just a legal thriller; it‚Äôs a peek into the human condition, making you think long after you've closed the book.
*   **Jake Brigance:** Jake is such a relatable character. He's not some superhero lawyer; he's flawed, tired, and often overwhelmed, but he possesses a strong moral compass. You really root for him as he tries to navigate the ethical minefield this case presents.
*   **Pacing and Detail:** Grisham is a master at setting a scene. The courtroom drama felt incredibly authentic, almost as if I was sitting in the jury box myself. The pacing is deliberate, building suspense with each legal maneuver and testimony. If you enjoy detailed procedural drama, this is definitely for you.

**A Few Things to Keep in Mind**

While I thoroughly enjoyed ""Sycamore Row,"" I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a couple of points. Because it's a legal thriller, there are moments of detailed legal discussion that might slow down the pace for some readers. It's not a fast-paced action book, but rather a slow burn that builds to a powerful climax. If you're looking for something that moves at breakneck speed, you might find certain sections require a bit more patience. However, this attention to detail is what makes the story so rich.

**Would I Recommend It? And For Whom?**

Absolutely, yes! I would highly recommend [Sycamore Row ‚Äì John Grisham (Jake Brigance Series Book 2)](https://pdfhive.com/sycamore-row-john-grisham/) to anyone who loves a good legal thriller, particularly those who appreciate stories that tackle significant social issues. If you're a fan of John Grisham's other works, or if you enjoy authors like Scott Turow, you will likely find this to be a compelling read. It‚Äôs also excellent for casual readers who enjoy a well-crafted mystery with depth.

**A Little Note for New Readers**

If you're new to longer books or legal thrillers, here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Take Your Time:** There's no rush to finish. Read at your own pace.
2.  **Break It Down:** If a chapter feels long, just aim to read a few pages or a specific section. Small victories add up!
3.  **Don't Be Afraid to Look Up Things:** If legal terms or historical context confuse you, a quick search can often clarify things and deepen your understanding.
4.  **Find Your Spot:** A comfy chair, good lighting, maybe a cup of tea. Make reading a pleasant experience.
5.  **It‚Äôs Okay to Put It Down:** If you're not enjoying a book after a fair shot, it's perfectly fine to set it aside. Not every book is for every person, and that's okay. But for a story like this one, I'd encourage you to stick with it ‚Äì the payoff is worth it!

Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore. ""Sycamore Row"" offers a robust story that makes you think, and I hope you consider giving it a try.

1nmgw9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1nmgw9k/f4aplayingm_romance_ideas/,(F4AplayingM) Romance ideas,"
Hello Reddit! Do you love romance ideas?Slow-burn romances? Hurt and comfort romances? Ohh, maybe a pregnancy romance idea? Well, I have ideas for all those categories! I'm not replacing any of my current partners or anything. I'm just posting the ideas floating around my head. Anyway, let's get to the important stuff! My name is Em, and I am a 22-year-old woman. I have been roleplaying for a long time. Like a very long time. I consider myself a novella-length writer. Which means I write around 500-2,000 words per post. I prefer to roleplay on Discord. I write exclusively in third person. I am an adult, so I will require that you are at least 22. I love chatting about our characters and sending TikToks or other stuff. Ohh, also the important part. I do enjoy smut, but I do a ratio of 80 percent story to 20 percent smut. That is not negotiable; I write for the joy of crafting a story, not to get off.



So to recap, here is what I'm looking for in a partner. Someone who is at least 22 years old. Someone who can match my length and writes exclusively in third person like I do. Someone who understands that these roles are not all smut. Someone who enjoys chatting and building friendships with their partners!Also, I understand you get busy, as I'm a college student and work full time, so if you are busy, just let me know! 

Also please use the password: Romance awaits. 



On to the roles! Now, I broke them up into categories to make it easier to understand. 
MMC is the male main character. 
FMC is the female main character. 




Pregnancy Plots:

1. The MMC is looking for a surrogate to help him start his family. Maybe his wife has passed, or maybe he is just tired of waiting for the one to come along. So he finds FCM through a surrogate agency and begins the journey to give him a family and much, much more.



2. MMC and FMC were a fling in college, and then they had a messy breakup. So she figured he wouldn't want anything to do with his special needs daughter. That is until they run into each other in a store years later. 



3. MMC and FMC work together. They actually despise each other. So much so that everyone in the office knows that. MMC pulls pranks on FMC just to piss her off. That is until FMC life falls apart. She was married, but then she found out her husband was cheating on her weeks after finding out she was pregnant. Her life falls apart. Little did she know the man she hated would be the one to help her put her life back together. 



Slow Burn plots:

1. FMC is a journalist, a reporter for a huge newspaper company. MMC is the famous person she is tasked with trying to get to agree to an interview. Fate has other plans, and the two end up in a love story fit for the times.  All the drama MMC has in the press is fabricated by FMC to save him. 



2. FMC is a world-class bull rider. When she is paralyzed in an accident. Her family hires FMC to help bring her out of her shell. The only problem is FMC hates MMC, but that slowly ebbs away. 



3. FCM is the queen of Scotland. The only child of the king and queen, she becomes queen after her mother's death. She is amazing at it, but to keep the country afloat, she must find a king. Her father arranges for her to marry the king of another country. Maybe Russia or England or something. FCM hates MMC with a passion. She wants to run the country because MMC cannot do it. So she spends her time planning to kill him. Unaware that MMC wants nothing to do with being king and would much rather study his hobbies. 



Hurt/comfort plots: 

1. MMC and FMC were best friends. They were inseparable until FMC was in a car accident after leaving MMC's party. He thinks he caused the accident, so he no longer speaks to her. That is until one day when he comes across her YouTube page that talks about her life and her love for him. 



2. FMC is homeless and injured, living in New York. She is barely surviving if she is being honest. Sure, she spends most of her money on drugs, but that's only because her leg doesn't hurt when she is high. One day she is trying to get a hot chocolate from a coffee shop while people grumble behind her. When it's not enough money, she just leaves. MMC watches the whole thing play out and decides he must help her. After all, he definitely has enough money to do so.



3. FMC has cystic fibrosis; she has made peace with dying. That is until she meets MMC, a vampire who now works at her job. He can't understand why she won't let him fix her. She can't understand why he cares enough to want to fix her. A beautiful love story is born. 



Enemies-to-lovers plots:


1 This one is truly an enemies-to-lovers idea. MMC is an awful person, a racist, a bigot, you name it. They are just awful.That is until they meet FMC, a woman who is everything they hate, but she isn't afraid to call him out on his wrongs. To change his mind. It's slow, it's ugly, and it's beautiful.



2. MMC and FMC families have hated each other for years. They don't really know why or understand it. Waking up one morning from a one-night stand, FMC is shocked to find MMC beside her. She vaguely remembers the night. The guy was smart, funny, and interested in her. Though she still hates him. This starts a very weird friendship with benefits that turns to more. 



3. FMC is a brutal serial killer. MMC is a cop tasked with getting FMC to help them catch a copycat killer. The two can barely stand each other, though in the hatred something else blooms.


4. FCM is a siren.  Her entire existence is to lure men to their deaths.  MMC is a hunter of supernatural. The entire time he has been looking for his friend.  Only to find she is the very thing he is hunting. 



Sample of my writing: 

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes‚Äîfive minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.

The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left.

Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact Adrain and slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.

Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.

That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrain was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.

It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.

That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world.  
""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.

Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.

The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.

PREGNANT.

In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.

All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow.  
With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.

Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed. She smiled at the memory of Jim reading bedtime stories in an empty room as Paige hid under the bed. He would end everyone with, ""Papa, loves you; it's okay. You are safe."" She needed that now more than ever.

One year ago I had my dream life. I was making $140k a year while working remotely 20 hrs a week, married to the love of my life, and travelling the world. Then suddenly I was let go from my job because of industry changes. As a contractor I wasn‚Äôt eligible for EI or severance.

Shortly after, I found out I‚Äôm pregnant with my 3rd baby. I was excited but scared since I‚Äôm now making $40k a year, and as a contractor, I‚Äôm not eligible for maternity leave. My husband assured me we would be ok and he would take care of us. But then he lost his job too!! 

We lost our insurance benefits from his work, he had to stop taking very important meds, and I had to stop going to much needed therapy. This led to both of us going a little crazy and some very toxic moments. We‚Äôre now taking a break from our relationship indefinitely. 

Our baby will be here soon and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm going to do. I‚Äôm barely scraping by. I don‚Äôt have enough for my basic necessities and there‚Äôs nothing left over to even get a coffee or go out to eat with friends. How the f am I going to afford another baby!! And how am I going to work at the same time??? Luckily I work remotely but my work is very focused and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to do it.

What should I do?? Please don‚Äôt suggest adoption. I love this baby girl so much already, I‚Äôll never let her go. ",6,1758423089.0,WhatShouldIDo,2,0.99,False

My best friend Monica was on top of my husband. Her dark hair spilled over her bare shoulders as she scrambled to cover herself, her eyes wide with shock.
Richard lay beneath her, his face flushed, his hands still gripping her waist like he could not let go.
Our bed. The Egyptian cotton sheets I had bought for our anniversary.
My heart was broken and I could not breathe.
""Claire!"" Monica's voice cracked as she grabbed for the sheet. ""Oh my God, Claire!""
Richard's eyes met mine across the room.
""How long have you been standing there?"" His voice was cold, almost annoyed like I was the one interrupting something I should not have.
""Are you saying I'm disturbing you?"" My tone was sharp as I stared at them.
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
CLAIRE‚ÄôS POV
I should have known something was wrong when I came home to silence.
Richard's car was in the driveway next to Monica's little red BMW, but the house felt empty. Too quiet.
""Richard?"" I called out, setting my purse on the marble table by the front door. ""Monica?""
My best friend had texted me an hour ago, saying she had stopped by to drop off the wedding photos from her cousin's ceremony last weekend.
Monica was always doing thoughtful things like that, bringing over fresh cookies, helping me pick out new curtains, and making sure I never felt lonely when Richard worked late.
Which was most nights lately.
I kicked off my heels and padded through the corridor in my stockings. The living room was empty, but I could hear something from upstairs.
A soft thudding sound, rhythmic and steady.
The sounds were coming from our bedroom.
My stomach twisted with an uneasiness I could not name. Something felt wrong, but I could not put my finger on what.
The air itself seemed heavy, charged with a tension that made my skin tickle.
I paused outside our bedroom door, my hand pausing over the handle. The sounds were clearer now, a rhythmic creaking, soft gasps, and something else.
Something that made my heart start racing for all the wrong reasons.
""Richard?"" I called again, my voice smaller this time.
The sounds stopped.
For a moment, there was complete silence. Then I heard Monica's voice, breathless and panicked: ""Oh God, someone's here.""
My hand shook as I pushed the door open.
And my world shattered into a million pieces.
Monica was on top of my husband. Her dark hair spilled over her bare shoulders as she scrambled to cover herself, her eyes wide with shock.
Richard lay beneath her, his face flushed, his hands still gripping her waist like he could not let go.
Our bed. The Egyptian cotton sheets I had bought for our anniversary. The throw pillows I had embroidered with little hearts during those lonely evenings when Richard worked late.
I could not breathe.
I could not move.
I could not think.
This was not real. This could not be real. Monica was my best friend. She was the one who helped me plan our anniversary dinner just last month.
She was the one who listened to me worry about Richard working too much, and who guaranteed me that all successful men went through phases like this.
She was the one who told me I was lucky to have such a devoted husband.
""Claire!"" Monica's voice cracked as she grabbed for the sheet. ""Oh my God, Claire!""
Richard's eyes met mine across the room. For just a second, I saw a flash of something‚Ä¶guilt, maybe, or regret. But then his face went hard, like a door slamming shut.
""How long have you been standing there?"" His voice was cold, almost annoyed like I was the one interrupting something I should not have.
How long? The question echoed in my head, but I could not make sense of it. How long had I been watching my life fall apart? How long had I been staring at the two people I trusted most in the world betraying me in the most intimate way possible?
""I... I just got home,"" I whispered. My voice sounded strange like it was coming from underwater. ""I called for you.""
Monica was crying now, hugging the sheet to her chest. ""Claire, please, you have to understand. We did not mean for this to happen. It just... it just happened.""
It just happened. Like they had accidentally fallen into bed together. Like clothes removed themselves and bodies just found each other without any choice or decision or betrayal involved.
The room started spinning. The walls seemed to stagger and sway like I was on a boat in rough water. My vision blurred at the edge, and a strange ringing filled my ears.
""Claire?"" Monica's voice sounded far away now. ""Claire, are you okay?""
I looked at Richard again. My husband. The man who had promised to love and cherish me until death do us part.
He was sitting up now, not bothering to cover himself, his blue eyes‚Ä¶.the eyes I had once thought were the most beautiful thing in the world‚Ä¶looking at me like I was a stranger.
Like I was an inconvenience.
""Richard,"" I breathed his name like a prayer.
But he did not answer.
-
In hospital, Richard wore an expensive suit and a face that belonged in a boardroom, not a hospital room where his wife was there.
But now is not the time to think about these.
""Richard."" I reached for his hand, but he pulled it away before I could touch him. ""We need to talk about what happened. About Monica. About us.""
Something flashed across his face, but it was gone so fast I might have imagined it.
""You're right,"" he said. ""We do need to talk.""
Relief flooded through me. Thank God. He wanted to work this out. We could get through this. Marriages survived infidelity all the time.
We could go to counseling, we could‚Ä¶.
Richard pulled an envelope from his jacket and set it on the bedside table.
My heart stopped.
""What is that?"" I whispered, even though some part of me already knew. Some part of me had been preparing for this moment since I saw the coldness in his eyes yesterday.
""Divorce papers."" His voice was steady, businesslike. ""My lawyer had them drawn up this morning.""
The words hit me like a physical blow. I flinched, my hand flying to my chest where it felt like something was tearing apart.
""Divorce papers,"" I repeated because surely I had misheard.
Surely my husband of three years was not sitting in my hospital room, while I was recovering from emergency surgery, handing me divorce papers.
""I want this done quickly and quietly,"" he continued like he was discussing a merger or a stock trade. ""No messy custody battles, no drawn-out proceedings. Clean and simple.""
I stared at him, searching his face for any trace of the man I had married. The man who used to bring me coffee in bed every Sunday morning.
The man who used to dance with me in the kitchen while dinner was cooked. The man who used to tell me I was the most beautiful woman in the world.
""Richard,"" My voice broke on his name. ""Is it because of Monica?‚Äù
He was silent for a while before he spoke, ""Monica is everything you're not,"" he continued, his voice never changing, never showing any emotion at all. ""She's independent. She has her own career, her own friends, and her own interests. She does not need me to validate her existence.""
Monica. My best friend. The woman who had held me while I cried about feeling disconnected from my husband.
The woman who had told me that Richard was just going through a stressful period at work. The woman who had encouraged me to be more understanding, more patient, more helpful.
Had she been planning this all along? Had every conversation we had about my marriage been her gathering information, figuring out exactly how to steal my husband away from me?
""How long?"" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.
""What?""
""How long have you been sleeping with her?""
Richard's jaw tightened. For the first time since he had walked into this room, he looked uncomfortable.
""That's not important.""
""It is to me."" I tried to sit up straighter, ignoring the pain in my side. ""How long have you been lying to me? How long have you been coming home to me after being with her?""
""Six months.""
Six months. Half a year of betrayal. Half a year of lies. Half a year of him smooching me goodnight with the same mouth he had been using to smooch her.
""Sign the papers,"" he said, his tone final. ""The settlement is generous. More than generous. You'll be able to buy a nice condo somewhere, start over.""
Start over. Like three years of marriage could just be erased. Like the life we had built together was nothing more than a rough draft that could be crumpled up and thrown away.
""What if I don't sign?"" I asked, even though I already knew the answer.
""Then I will challenge it. I will drag this through the courts for years. I will make sure everyone knows exactly why our marriage failed."" His blue eyes‚Ä¶the eyes I had once thought were the most beautiful thing in the world‚Ä¶.went ice cold.
I looked down at my left hand, at the wedding ring that had lived there for three years. The ring Richard had slipped onto my finger while he promised to love and cherish me until death do us part.
I twisted it off my finger and held it out to him.
""Take it,"" I whispered.
He stared at the ring for a long moment, and for just a second, I thought I saw something crack in his carefully controlled face.
But then he took the ring and slipped it into his pocket without a word.
I picked up the pen the lawyer had left with the papers.
My hand trembled as I brought it to the signature line. Claire Blackwood, I started to write, then stopped.
That was not my name anymore, was it? I was not Mrs. Richard Blackwood. I was just Claire. Claire nobody. Claire with no identity except the one I had lost when I had given up everything to be his wife.
I set the pen down and closed my eyes.
Somewhere in this hospital, there were other women recovering from surgery. Women with husbands who held their hands and brought them flowers and whispered words of love and comfort.
Women whose marriages were real, whose love was valued, whose hearts were not being ripped out of their chests by the very person who was supposed to protect them.
But I was not one of those women.
I was Claire, the woman who was not enough. The woman who loved too much. The woman who was so pathetic and clingy that her husband could not wait to escape her.
I opened my eyes and picked up the pen again.
This time, I signed.
""Good,"" he said, gathering up the papers. ""That makes this easier.""
""Makes what easier?""
Richard sat down in the chair again, but this time he leaned forward, his elbows on his knees, his blue eyes fixed on my face with an intensity that made my skin crawl.
""Monica's pregnant. And we are getting married,"" he smiled, ""As soon as the divorce is final.""
Pregnant. Married.
The words hit me like a cargo train. Monica was pregnant with Richard's baby. The baby I had been hoping for, praying for, dreaming about for three years.
""How long?"" I whispered.
""Two months."" Richard's voice was steady, matter-of-fact. ""We're telling people after the wedding.""
Two months.
She had been pregnant when she helped me plan our anniversary dinner. She had been carrying Richard's child when she sat in my living room and listened to me worry about our marriage.
She had been growing his baby inside her while she comforted me and told me everything would be okay.
""Claire?"" Richard's voice seemed to come from very far away. ""Are you all right?""
All right? Was I all right?
My husband had just told me I disgusted him. He had told me our entire marriage was a lie. He had told me he had been sickened by my touch for months.
And now he was telling me that my best friend was pregnant with his child.
Was I all right?
I started to laugh.
It came out as a broken, hysterical sound that did not seem to belong to me. I laughed until tears streamed down my face, until I could not breathe.
""Claire."" Richard stepped back into the room, and for the first time since this conversation started, he looked worried. ""Claire, stop. You're scaring me.""
Scaring him? That was rich. He had just finished telling me I was the most pathetic, disgusting, suffocating woman alive, and now he was scared because I was laughing?
""I'm sorry,"" I gasped between fits of laughter. ""I'm just trying to figure out how I'm supposed to thank you for this favor you're doing me.""
""Claire‚Ä¶‚Äù
""No, really,"" I continued, my laughter taking on an edge that made even me nervous. ""You've given me such a gift. You've shown me exactly how pathetic I am. How worthless. How completely unlovable.""
""That's not what I‚Ä¶‚Äù
""Isn't it?"" I wiped the tears from my cheeks with the back of my hand.
""You've made it very clear, Richard. I'm disgusting. I'm suffocating. I'm so nauseous that my own husband couldn't stand to touch me. And my best friend? She's carrying your baby while I'm lying here like the pathetic fool I am.""
The laughter died in my throat, replaced by something harder. Something colder.
""But you know what the funny thing is?"" I looked directly into his eyes, and for the first time in this entire conversation, he was the one who looked away first.
""Someday you're going to realize what you threw away. Someday you're going to miss having someone who loved you unconditionally.""
""Claire‚Ä¶‚Äù
""Get out."" The words came out quiet but firm. ""Get out of my room. Get out of my life. And Richard?""
He turned back to look at me.
""Don't ever come back.""
The door closed behind him with a soft click, and I was alone.
Alone with the machines beeping around me. Alone with the divorce papers that made our separation official. Alone with the knowledge that the man I had loved more than life itself thought I was disgusting.
But as I lay there in that sterile hospital room, something began to change inside me. The heartbreak was still there, raw and agonizing. But underneath it, something else was growing.
Anger.
Not the hot, explosive kind that burns out quickly. This was something cooler, more dangerous. This was the kind of anger that was planned. That waits. That remembers every cruel word and files it away for later use.
Richard thought I was pathetic? He thought I was weak?
He was about to find out just how wrong he was.",1,1758423083.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

Since then when have changed store managers twice and got our old lead manager(2nd in charge) back. J our new SM is a great guy and K (2nd) has always been amazing and I was thrilled she came back.  After the last SM left I have been  voicing that I would like to be a supervisor again now that things have settled at home. 
  I know just because I want a position doesn't mean I get it so I've been making sure to help how ever I can and go above and beyond in what ever I could i.e helping teach new hires, helping the new SM with issues any issues he had, calling the help desk for issues, food/coffee runs, starting and running the stores social media(per SM's request) truck team, markdown team, party planing/potluck planning etc. Never an issue, never told anything was wrong, always praised on being a great employee.  2 months ago my older brother passed away and I was crushed, I took my  3 bereavement days and 4 days I already had off before coming back.  About a month or so ago they rehired a girl we'll call V.  I didnt have have a problem with V and we generally picked on each other like sisters or hit on each other( nothing to crazy or uncomfortable) but when she left we were both sups. And had an argument, we made up 10 mins later but she walked out and quit.  I was excited she was coming back and we laughed about the whole ordeal like it was so stupid.  
  2 weeks after V came back a new girl, T, told me that she and V were going to be sups, I went told K and asked her if the was true and she said yes but they were seeing if they could and another supervisor position and then the would add me too.  I left the office but that stung a little but I let it go and went on.  Last week I pulled into work not really feeling it but still trying V told me I looked like a BA and I said thanks still in my car, then she turned to K and told her she didn't recognize me and thought they were gonna be robbed.  It felt high schoolish, but I tried to brush it off and went in.  Greeted T like ""heyyy boss lady"" and went to put up my lunch, side note it was a day we had truck and we have potluck those days but I hadn't heard anything about it.  T came in as I was locking my locker and asked what we were doing for potluck, I nonchalantly replied ""fuck if I know I just brought my lunch"" (not an uncommon response for me in employee only areas) and I walked out of the break room.  While waiting for the truck J gave everyone tasks and turned to T and V and told them they were the managers on duty, it reminded me that I had been looked over for the position and it hurt so I figured since I was not really cheery I would just keep to myself and just do my tasks.  Truck shows up we unload and start getting it unboxed and out on the floor, some of the boxes are long so I asked V if she could turn hers so I could put the last of this set on the table and it had a quick exchange:
Me: hey V can you turn your box so this one will fit?
V: sure you happy now
Me: nope never happy
V: yeah I can tell your miserable 
Me: yup that's me miserable b*tch
I assumed it was our usual banter put the box on the table and went to go to the bathroom.  While I was waited K came and told me she was feeling some hostility between me and V and didn't want any issues so we needed to come to the office. We sit down V says she has no issues, I relay the box thing and that we weren't serious and V says if someone give attitude she's giving it back. I was confused I said I hardly spoke to anyone today what did I do, V said she wasn't the only one who thought so and did I want to get the other person, I said sure.  She came back with T who said the exchange in the breaktoom was filled with attitude why would I say that to her.  Again I'm confused I didn't snap at her and like I said that's a pretty common response from me in areas with no customers. I continue to tell all 3 to just leave me be and I am fine but now it's 3 against 1 talking over me interrupting, not letting me talk and rapid fire ""what's wrong, somethings wrong, why are you upset, why do you have an attitude?"" I snapped, I slammed my hand on the desk and shouted pointing at K "" you want to know what's wrong you and J kept telling me when a position came up you would get me in and you skipped over me twice!"" 
  T and V asked like 5 times that it wasn't them i said no, so they walked out and told J to come in where I told him the same thing; for months I had been hyped up to believe that I would be a supervisor and had been taking on extra to show I  still could, that they had lied to me and while I know it's a business but that hurt to constantly be told how great i was and everything but not good enough. K was focused mostly on the fact that i called her a liar, J started telling me that here lately i had been giving 110% like I used to and that it was the little things such as i left my drink on the back counter twice, I sometimes forgot my walkie talkie, every time there's an issue I have to come up with a better solution, I've been on my phone on the floor.  Now to be fair the walkie talkie is considered part of our uniform when we are clocked in, and the drink I had been told that's no lie and my fault, the phone was making content for the 5 socials I had made like he asked, and if you ask me for ideas I give them not trying to one up anyone.  I chose not to remind them that I was still working through my brothers passing because they were going on about how I was good enough and they did care about me and they discussed it for days before choosing T and V.  That V didnt even was the position.  That hurt even more. I did point out that in those 2 months they never gave me any criticism on my work only praise and they said they should have communicated with me better.  I told them the damage was done and couldn't be undone I would be putting in my notice when I found a new job.  J then told me "" we'll now the management team isn't complete"" it is, all the spots have been filled.  I started to feel trapped and I just wanted out of the office so I just nodded said yep sure were all good let's go back to work, K hugged me and told me I wasn't going anywhere and to stop looking for a new job, V and T came back we all said we are good and went out.  One of the other associates told me when V and T came out the first time the didnt go back to work but off to the side to whisper and giggle like high school mean girls.

Standing in the middle of my bedroom, I bend forward, letting my long, dark hair hang down, down, down‚Äîalmost touching the ground. I grab it with both hands, and with the help of years of practice, I swoop it up into an effortless, messy bun and slide the hair tie off my wrist to secure it to the top of my head.

I stand straight and look at the mirror hanging on my wall to see my dimly lit reflection staring back at me. My hair is dirty and tangled, but I don‚Äôt worry about it‚Äîno one knows but me. My skin feels oily, but I‚Äôm tired of caring for my everyday needs right now.

Ignoring myself, I walk out of the room, through the hallway, and into the kitchen with a rhythmic march. I walk to the stove and turn it on with purpose, as if it was something I‚Äôd thought about before doing it. I decide this means I‚Äôm making tea, so I pull the nearby, half-full kettle over to the reddening burner and go to the pantry to get a tea bag.

I approach the tea cabinet and pull open the top drawer. I scan the contents, but nothing catches my attention. I push the drawer closed with discontent and open the one below it. The first thing I notice is the box of green tea pouches. I pull one out as if it‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôd been looking for.

Then, with the same purposeful, brisk walk, I leave the pantry, march through the kitchen, the hallway, and into my bedroom. I snatch the mug I drained of my morning coffee hours earlier from my desk. I bring the two items‚Äîtea bag and mug‚Äîback to the kitchen and set them next to the stove, where the kettle still sits and the water inside is still smooth and unbothered by the heat underneath.

I lean back on the kitchen island behind me and stare at the stubborn kettle with impatience. I don‚Äôt necessarily want tea, and I‚Äôm not in a hurry for anything or anyone, but I want to want something‚Äîso I decide that wanting a big, steaming cup of bland green tea will have to be enough.

I sigh. Why is wanting so exhausting?

I wish I could just be satisfied with not wanting‚Äîsatisfied with satisfaction. But I know nothing is that simple.

And yet, here I am, executing my daily tasks in my daily schedule. Not happy, but not unhappy. I just want out of the simple‚Äînot for life to slow down or speed up, just for it to feel less monitored. And making tea in the middle of the day, after months of not drinking tea, seemed like success enough.

I give an unexpected grin to the tea kettle as it begins to whisper to me. It has no idea what I‚Äôm thinking‚Äîjust like the people around me, who are alive and animate but still don‚Äôt know. Even I, who think my own thoughts, haven‚Äôt got a clue what any of it means. It‚Äôs like I exist on an entirely different philosophical wavelength than I can even interpret myself.

I continue to stare at the kettle as I begin to notice a stinging sensation‚Äîone singular strand of hair pulling too tightly against my scalp in the tangle of knots I‚Äôve called a bun. With complete disassociation, I fold my body over again and pull the tie from my hair‚Äîjust as the kettle starts to screech at me.

But I don‚Äôt care.

I continue the familiar motion of smoothing out my hair and redoing it all over again.

Bahrain‚Äôs 2025 Business Environment: Economic Growth, New Incentives, and Regulatory Updates\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain business towers with professionals walking outside.). Forbes Business ranked Bahrain among the world‚Äôs top five destinations for foreign SME investment, crediting business process simplification and near-unmatched 100% foreign ownership (Forbes business analysis).\
Importantly, the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism (MOICT) announced that, effective March 2025, a single-window Sijilat update slashed CR waiting times by 55%. That‚Äôs not marketing fluff. This policy change directly cut our team‚Äôs average license turnaround from 14 to just 5 business days‚Äîa fact validated by recent Gulfnews reports on regional reforms.\
Bahrain‚Äôs strategic location between Saudi Arabia and the UAE remains a powerful draw. However, its distinct regulatory agility‚Äîflexible business structures, real 100% foreign ownership options, and investor-friendly free zones (ownership guide, free zones details)‚Äîputs it ahead of its neighbors in speed, simplicity, and value.\
The Numbers That Matter: Business Formation in 2025\
\
Foreign-owned enterprises: Up 21% since 2023.\
Sijilat platform adoption: 87% of all new CRs processed online.\
Average total setup cost for SMEs: BHD 250-800 (standard LLC or SPC).\
\
What Is Commercial Registration (CR) and Why Does It Matter?\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration: Bahrain entrepreneurs at a professional meeting. step.\
\
‚ÄúNo CR, no business. Simple as that. Yet, getting the CR right the first time saves months of untangling compliance knots.‚Äù\
(Personal tip: Always double-check your business activity codes on Sijilat‚Äîincorrect classification costs time and money later.)\
\
Bahrain Company Formation: Structure Choices that Affect Your CR Fees\
Your business structure‚ÄîLLC, SPC, partnership, or branch‚Äîsets your CR cost and compliance obligations. Deep dive into entity types and structures for context.\
\
LLC (With Limited Liability): Most popular for SMEs. Minimum two shareholders.\
SPC (Single Person Company): For solo founders and consultants.\
Branch Office: Foreign businesses seeking Bahrain presence.\
WLL/Partnerships: Niche uses; usual for family or local partnerships.\
\
Key point: More complex structures (e.g., holding companies) mean higher fees, longer registration, and extra documentation. For 99% of foreign founders, a straightforward LLC or SPC is optimal.\

\
Surprisingly, many entrepreneurs forget the annual renewal and assume the initial fee is all they‚Äôll ever pay. Annual CR fees are due each year (budget BHD 80‚Äì400 for most SMEs). Failing to renew? Penalties of BHD 50‚Äì100/month quickly add up.\
Step-by-Step Guide: Fast-Tracking Your CR Application (With Insider Time & Cost Savings)\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: Entrepreneurs reviewing paperwork and documents at a modern desk.\
- Proof of Address (utility bill or lease)\
- Memorandum & Articles of Association\
- Board Resolution/POA (for branches)\
- Activity details (precise Sijilat codes; check twice!)**\
Step 2: Submit via Sijilat‚ÄîSmart Timing\
\
Avoid: 11:00 am‚Äî2:00 pm (queues swamp the system, especially mid-week and during Ramadan).\
Best: 8:00‚Äì8:45 am or 3:30‚Äì4:30 pm (faster government responses).\
Pro hack: Use Bahrain Bay‚Äôs Sijilat service desk for English-speaking help‚Äîless crowded than Seef or Isa Town.\
\
Step 3: Pay Fees Swiftly and Get Receipts\
Pay all government CR fees via Sijilat or at the designated MOICT window in Seef, Diplomatic Area, or online. Never hand cash to ‚Äúhelpers‚Äù outside‚Äîthe only exceptions are licensed company formation agents (recommended provider), who will issue official receipts.\
Step 4: Municipality and Chamber Approvals\
If your business requires a Municipality License (retail, F&B, warehouse), file this in parallel to your CR, not after. Many overlook this, causing multi-week delays (I learned this the hard way‚Äîdon‚Äôt repeat my mistake).\
Step 5: Collect and Verify Your CR\
Once approvals land, download your digital Commercial Registration certificate‚Äîprint multiple copies, and create a folder for renewals and amendments (CR process guide). Bring paper copies to banks and regulatory meetings; electronic documents speed up verification.\
Personal aside: My first banking appointment in Seef ground to a halt because I hadn‚Äôt printed the Arabic CR. Now, I keep both English and Arabic versions on my phone and in my bag.\

- 100% ownership guide\

- Local sponsorship for restricted activities\
Best approach: Use a free zone for unrestricted ownership and cost savings on certain taxes. For regulated sectors (e.g., insurance, banking), consult with the EDB or a trusted company formation expert.\
Compliance, Accounting, and Post-Formation Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation: Legal professional preparing regulatory documents in an office.\
\
CR Renewal Fee: BHD 80‚Äì400 (activity-dependent)\
Chamber of Commerce Renewal: BHD 20‚Äì60\
Accounting/Bookkeeping: From BHD 200/year (outsourcing saves time)\
VAT Registration (if BHD 37,500+ turnover): No charge for registration, but quarterly filings are mandatory.\
\
Ramadan business hours: Most government offices shift to 8:00 am ‚Äì 1:00 pm‚Äîplan filings accordingly. And always accept invitations to majlis coffee if offered; local business etiquette is unique, and these small rituals go a long way in smoothing regulatory hurdles.\
Compliance Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\
A common misstep: missing the annual CR renewal window. The MOICT sends an SMS reminder, but system hiccups sometimes mean you‚Äôll only see the notice in your Sijilat dashboard. I now use a dual reminder system: Google Calendar and a local business WhatsApp group.\
\
‚ÄúRenewing late cost me BHD 100 in fines once‚Äînow I tell every new founder: set two reminders, and never assume the system will auto-notify you on time.‚Äù\
\
Bahrain Business Customs: The Culture That Shapes Regulatory Realities\
Tangent? Perhaps. But understanding Bahrain‚Äôs unique business culture is not just a nice-to-have‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic advantage.\
\
Majlis-style Meetings: Important negotiations often take place over coffee, not in boardrooms‚Äîespecially in the Diplomatic Area.\
Ramadan Adjustments: Expect slower processing and shorter working hours; patience and respect go far.\
Coffee Service Protocols: Accepting coffee (even if you take only a sip) is a gesture of respect‚Äîrefusal is frowned upon.\
\
These traditions spill over into the bureaucratic process. Relationships and reputation matter. Staff at the Sijilat desk in Bahrain Bay will remember if you‚Äôre courteous and prepared‚Äîwhich honestly helped me through a sticky municipality approval snag last year.\
Comparing Bahrain to the UAE and Saudi Arabia: Why Bahrain Wins for Fast, Affordable Company Formation\
Bahrain wins on cost, speed, and ownership flexibility. The UAE‚Äôs free zones are efficient‚Äîbut can be expensive and restrictive outside of tech or professional sectors. Saudi Arabia offers a vast market, yet the local partner requirement and slow license process are frequent deal-breakers for SMEs.\
\
Bahrain: BHD 170‚Äì300 for most CRs, 100% ownership, typically 5‚Äì10 days setup.\
UAE: AED 12,000‚Äì30,000 (BHD 1,200‚Äì3,000+) for free zone licenses, local agent sometimes required.\
Saudi Arabia: SAR 10,000+ (BHD 1,000+), plus capital deposits, and mandatory Saudi partner in most sectors.\
\
Recommended Resources and Avoiding the Most Common Mistake\
\
Alt text: Professional business support: Business consultant advising client in a modern office.. They speak fluent English, handle 90% of paperwork, and know exactly which Sijilat codes to use to sidestep hidden surcharges.\
Most common mistake: Rushing document prep and missing a required item (especially the Arabic translations).\
Prevention strategy: Triple-check the Sijilat requirements online, have docs translated before you start, and always bring an extra hard copy to the MOICT desk.\

1nmgnld,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nmgnld,My DIY headphone project using AliExpress parts,"Hi, this is my DIY headphone project. As you can see, I used a Koss Portapro replica from AliExpress that came with its own cable. At first, I installed the drivers without any baffle, and they sounded really bad, almost like an ""evil harman"" tuning, then I covered the entire baffle with eva foam, but that made them way too dark, i ended up mounting them on a piece of eva foam with open spaces on the top and bottom, all sealed with this porous paper I found at home and firmly secured with masking tape.

I don‚Äôt have a lot to compare them to, but next to my CCZ Coffee Beam IEMs, they sound really similar. Compared to my Redragon Chroma Lamia 2, the only difference is that the Redragons have more expansive bass.

I built them into a pair of hearing protection earmuffs, also from AliExpress, these are wider than the typical 3M ones, just a heads-up, not all AliExpress earmuffs isolate well. I‚Äôll include a screenshot of the ones I recommend.

I‚Äôve always wanted a pair of headphones that are really durable, offer great isolation, but aren‚Äôt like Bluetooth ones that suck at blocking sudden high-frequency noises. I also love that I can just open these up, clean them, or replace any part. The cable exit is covered with hot glue (silicone) to help reduce microphonics.

I‚Äôm open to trying more expensive drivers in the future. However, a cable upgrade is unlikely‚ÄîI greatly prefer the comfort of a thin one and have no plans to make it replaceable, as simplicity is a priority. Furthermore, the vocal clarity is currently in a real sweet spot, so adding a mesh in front of the driver is out of the question. I've also considered 3D printing parts but seriously doubt the typical plastic used would provide the same level of sound isolation and resistance.

Last but not least, I have hyperacusis. I can‚Äôt listen to loud music or for long periods, so having headphones that isolate this well without the discomfort of IEMs lets me listen peacefully at low volumes. I've been in situations where I've cranked the volume all the way up by accident, and by instinct I throw them away, that is another great advantage of how resistant they are‚Ä¶

I mean, here I am, just chugging along in my 50s, thinking my biggest challenge was going to be finding the best bingo hall in town. Instead, I picked up a paddle and suddenly found myself giggling like a kid again. Seriously, have you ever tried running around chasing that little yellow ball? It‚Äôs exhilarating! 

Here are some reasons why I think you should grab a paddle ASAP:

- **Full-Body Workout**: It‚Äôs not just about the arms! Running around the court, shifting your weight, and lunging for that ball? Hello, core engagement!

- **Social Connection**: I‚Äôve met some amazing people! üçπ Sharing laughs and stories about how we (almost) missed the ball, while enjoying some pickleball banter? Sign me up!

- **Mental Boost**: You know that feeling of winning a point? Or just for hitting that perfect shot? Instant mood booster! Who needs therapy when you‚Äôve got adrenaline?

- **Low Impact, High Fun**: It‚Äôs much easier on the joints than, say, tennis. Trust me, my knees and I are dancing through this new hobby instead of groaning!

- **Easier to Learn**: If you can swing a paddle, you can join in! There‚Äôs not a ton of pressure ‚Äì everyone‚Äôs just there to have a good time (and show off their lightning-fast reflexes once in a while).

I honestly feel like I‚Äôve stumbled onto a hidden gem. I‚Äôm talking about a fun way to stay active while meeting new friends and flushing away the stress of everyday life. Who knew pickleball could be this magical?

I just had a heart palputation I believe. I was sitting on the toilet (just sitting not using the restroom), and my heart rate got really fast for a few seconds. Afterwards I started feeling a sort of ache in the middle of my chest and I started shivering (I think due to anxiety). My chest is still sore in the center but seems to relieve when I massage the middle of my sternum, and the shivering has mostly stopped. Although the soreness in the middle of my sternum was not there before the palputation. 

I did not feel a numbing sensation or any slurring. I can smile fine. Talk fine. Raise my arms. 

Context to maybe help:
I am male, 24, 5'11"", ~190lbs. I weightlift 4-5 days a week, I drink preworkout (approx. 200mg caffeine per day), although I did not workout today, but did drink coffee. I don't smoke, I drink socially. I've been taking tylenol/advil pm for the last few days, and plan to take 28mg diphenhydramine tonight. 

I drink creatine, magnesium (for rls symptoms) and protein supplements. 

I woke up a bit more irritable today, not sure why, and I ate more fast food today than usual. But that seems to be the only difference today. I drank 2.5 liters of water so far, usually about 3 liters. 

I'm not sure if I should be worried or what the next steps are? Can I wait to get to a PCP about this or is this an emergency? Can I workout tomorrow?

I've gone by my name for 7 years and started HRT immediately after moving out 2 years ago. 23. 

 Im growing facial hair but just shave before anytime I visit family, which is about once every week or two. Shaving in itself is fine and euphoric but not having facial hair is dysphoric. My dad is openly disgusted by trans people and has said queer people should die. My mom has seen my name tags over the years and makes comments but ignores it. My older sister of 14 years is pretty chill as a person.  I know she thinks being queer doesnt matter, her best friend is bisexual, and her 5 year old likes dresses and skirts and she just says she wishes people cared less. I just REALLY want to frown my facial hair out so I feel like I have to come out, and it'll help me pass more. If I lose people I lose people and its inevitable if I want to be happy. 

After two weeks of calling my sister a lot and stopping by her work at the end of the day to get her coffee (new job down the street so not odd) I kept putting it off. I started to dissociate about it and then just told her on Wednesday while I was a little over it to get it done with. 

She was supportive but seemed kind of at a loss and sounded sad about it. We could joke but she said she wished I told her sooner. That she thought I was just androgynous since I dont seem like 23 year old boys she knows. That she'll need time to adjust speech but it'll be fine and she just values my comfort and doesnt want to diminish the bond we've had. She doesnt know how my dad will take it but thinks our mom will freak out. She said she'd give them crap if they went no contact with me, so its just a matter of conflict that we'd have to figure out. Then she said she'd call me back and we'd talk about it more another time. 

I think thats good. But it feels weird. I know she was positively affirming but its so hard to learn not to feel scared. I know she's busy with her kids but Im waiting on the edge of my seat for a phone call back üíÄ

He finds whenever he plays something she'll immediately say it's poor quality. He thinks she's full of it and determines to buy great equipment, disguise it as ugly/old/bad and prove her wrong. 

George writes a letter to Dear Abby about his dating woes, parents, neuroses and losing his fiancee. Its wildly popular with women and he hears them every day comment how they wish they could meet him. 

Nobody believes its him. He starts writing a series of letters to Dear Abby with specific details about his life to prove it but they're being edited out or not published at all. 

Kramer goes to a bookstore that has a group trying to get them to ban some books, including an obscure pulp novel he read over and over as a lonely child. 

He protests and starts a ""read-in"" version of a sit-in  where they  bring their own books and take up seats. It makes the store look popular though and he also caves quickly to buying snacks/coffee and using their restroom. 

""It doesn't sound like you're protesting at all. It sounds like you're their best customer!""

He tries to devise better ways. 

Elaine dates a man who says he is a ghost writer for a popular romantic thriller series. He's written 3 of the 6 books and his are the most popular ones. 

He introduces her to the public author and they hit it off. He explicitly comments how he dislikes that the other guy gets all the credit and fans and the money isn't worth it. He's jealous and says if the other author wasn't so darn attractive and ""cover friendly"" as the ""face"" then HE would be able to get his picture on the back cover 

Elaine finds his little-brother syndrome annoying and notes that the Face is actually more attractive and is into HER as well. 

The ghost writer helps George write some later letters and ends up using it as am opportunity to claim HE is Despondent and Discouraged and finally get some publicity. 

The real writer has a signing at the bookstore Kramer is protesting at. He and Elaine have a secret tryst in the self-help section.

Kramer does a drastic measure that goes horribly wrong and the Face gets his face disfigured

I stand straight and look at the mirror hanging on my wall to see my dimly lit reflection staring back at me. My hair is dirty and tangled, but I don‚Äôt worry about it‚Äîno one knows but me. My skin feels oily, but I‚Äôm tired of caring for my everyday needs right now.

Ignoring myself, I walk out of the room, through the hallway, and into the kitchen with a rhythmic march. I walk to the stove and turn it on with purpose, as if it was something I‚Äôd thought about before doing it. I decide this means I‚Äôm making tea, so I pull the nearby, half-full kettle over to the reddening burner and go to the pantry to get a tea bag.

I approach the tea cabinet and pull open the top drawer. I scan the contents, but nothing catches my attention. I push the drawer closed with discontent and open the one below it. The first thing I notice is the box of green tea pouches. I pull one out as if it‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôd been looking for.

Then, with the same purposeful, brisk walk, I leave the pantry, march through the kitchen, the hallway, and into my bedroom. I snatch the mug I drained of my morning coffee hours earlier from my desk. I bring the two items‚Äîtea bag and mug‚Äîback to the kitchen and set them next to the stove, where the kettle still sits and the water inside is still smooth and unbothered by the heat underneath.

I lean back on the kitchen island behind me and stare at the stubborn kettle with impatience. I don‚Äôt necessarily want tea, and I‚Äôm not in a hurry for anything or anyone, but I want to want something‚Äîso I decide that wanting a big, steaming cup of bland green tea will have to be enough.

I sigh. Why is wanting so exhausting?

I wish I could just be satisfied with not wanting‚Äîsatisfied with satisfaction. But I know nothing is that simple.

And yet, here I am, executing my daily tasks in my daily schedule. Not happy, but not unhappy. I just want out of the simple‚Äînot for life to slow down or speed up, just for it to feel less monitored. And making tea in the middle of the day, after months of not drinking tea, seemed like success enough.

I give an unexpected grin to the tea kettle as it begins to whisper to me. It has no idea what I‚Äôm thinking‚Äîjust like the people around me, who are alive and animate but still don‚Äôt know. Even I, who think my own thoughts, haven‚Äôt got a clue what any of it means. It‚Äôs like I exist on an entirely different philosophical wavelength than I can even interpret myself.

I continue to stare at the kettle as I begin to notice a stinging sensation‚Äîone singular strand of hair pulling too tightly against my scalp in the tangle of knots I‚Äôve called a bun. With complete disassociation, I fold my body over again and pull the tie from my hair‚Äîjust as the kettle starts to screech at me.

But I don‚Äôt care.

I continue the familiar motion of smoothing out my hair and redoing it all over again.

The earth is a sphere but our consciousness resides in a dimension which is a plain. Paradoxical to this, the mind is the creator of the shape of all it interprets by being the sole, 'soul projector'. Subliminal manipulation is the corner stone of our society. The only thing that exists is the energy of the whole. Which is what we all are. You and your coffee table are the same atoms perceived differently.

You and your table and your couch and your dog and your car and your friends and the trees and the fungi and the stars and the universe are all atoms vibrating on a frequency that is recognised by a debated fact called consciousness. From a flat fabric we create then project an external code forming an environment. We exist from ancient laws and codes which are yet to be fathomed. Time doesn't exist without measurement that entropy forces us to give.

We have tricked ourselves into imagining that the illusion is real for soul purpose of consciously rediscovering what we truly are.

It frustrates me that, it's been scientifically proposed on with great merit that we exist in a holographic matrix,  built by atoms through binary coding, given information by a quantum field and fundamentally only viewed as solid because were only here for a short and slow enough amount of time that what we see and interact with is conceived and viewed as a solid environment. There is absolutely no law or manifest by our common man that is real. Only ideas deemed to constitute some sort of a society which is perceived as appropriate. While helpful in some aspects, we exist in a debatable state of existence and on any given day our dignity and safety are threatened in a never ending loop of fear and control. The attached price of existence doesn't exist. ",1,1758421043.0,u_North-Scientist2829,0,1.0,False
