I don't feel much difference from none-20mg-30mg. no switch of focus but the noise has lowered (not gone but toned down) and i feel some side effects like dizziness etc. i was taking it in the morning with a cup of protein milk (18grms of protein per-cup). Which i found out at my dr follow up not to take it with calcium or citrus. Opps so i moved to a calcium free protein, usually nuts and whole grain toast with my meds, coffee one hour after. 

I feel very little motivation to do anything and it's making me notice hunger pangs more. Otherwise I'm not sure what else to do. I was expecting more focus and clear thoughts. Instead I'm not getting much. I didn't think it was a build up in system kind of drug...

Oh and i sleep well. Like a solid 6.5 hrs a night with lots of deep/REM and very little wake ups. I've always slept well. 

I appreciate any insight. Thank you!",1,1768544560.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False
1qe8eak,https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_live/comments/1qe8eak/are_you_seeking_where_is_perfection_of_human_life/,are you seeking where is perfection of human life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qe8bnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/1qe8bnn/why_you_are_probably_using_coding_agents_wrong/,Why you are (probably) using coding agents wrong,"Most people probably use coding agents wrong. There I said it again.

They treat agents like smart, autonomous teammates/junior dev with their own volition and intuition and then wonder why the output is chaotic, inconsistent, or subtly/less subtly broken.

An agent is not a “better ChatGPT.” The correct mental model when using agent to write your code is to be **an orchestrator of its execution**, not let it be independent thinker and expecting ""here is a task based on custom domain and my own codebase, make it work"". You have to define the structure, constraints, rules, and expectations. The agent just runs inside that box. You don't want agent to be creative or ""figure it out"", you want agent on shortest chain possible to do the heavy lifting for you when you need it to.

ChatGPT, Gemini, etc. work *standalone* because they come with heavy built-in guardrails and guidelines and are tuned for conversation and problem solving, plus they get lot more resources per call. Agents, on the other hand, touch *all* content they have zero idea about: your code, files, tools, side effects. They don’t magically inherit discipline or domain knowledge. They have to get that knowledge.

If you don’t supply your own guardrails, standards, and explicit instructions, the agent will happily optimize for speed and hallucinate its way through your repo.

Agents amplify intent. If your intent isn’t well-defined, they amplify chaos.

What really worked best for me is this structure, for example:

You have this task to extend customer login logic:  
\[long wall of text that is probably JIRA task written by PM before having morning coffee\]

*this is the point where most people hit enter and just wait for agent to do ""magic"", but there is more*

To complete this task, you have to do X and Y, in those location A and B etc.

Before you start on this task use the file in root directory named **guidelines.txt** to figure how to write the code.

And this is where the magic happens, in guidelines.txt you want:

* all your ins and outs of your domain, your workflow (simplified)
* where the meat of the app is located (models, views, infrastructure)
* the less obvious ""gotchas""
* what the agent can touch
* what the agent must NEVER touch or only after manual approval
* patterns it should respect

This approach yielded best and faster results for me and least ""man, that is just wrong, what the hell""",0,1768544185.0,devops,1,0.2,False

In the past, home espresso machines mainly relied on heating blocks for warming up. However, many modern semi-automatic coffee machines now feature boilers. To maintain stable coffee extraction temperatures, these boilers need to have a certain capacity—at least 500ml or more. If not, the heating might struggle to keep up after brewing just one cup of coffee. Additionally, many users have started equipping their homes with machines featuring E61 group heads, which come with even larger boilers, typically at least 1 liter. While this setup is often considered more professional, the preheating time can be quite lengthy—usually around 15-20 minutes. For a home setting, where you often only brew 1-2 cups of coffee at a time, such large boilers can feel inefficient. They consume more energy, are less environmentally friendly, and the water in the boiler is continuously reheated over extended periods, which isn’t very hygienic. Yet, despite these drawbacks, many people still opt for machines with large boilers for home use. But why? Am I the only one who thinks convenience should be the top priority for home coffee machines? With heating blocks combined with precise PID temperature control, it’s still possible to make a great cup of coffee. Is my viewpoint outdated?",0,1768543933.0,espresso,1,0.5,False

I'm 30 years old, male, and autistic, and I've never been able to truly connect with anyone. Although I want to, whenever I have to take a step further in the relationship, I feel an immense difficulty. A blockage. Part of me always justified it as the need to prioritize work and studies over personal life. Today, I realized the limitation that autism imposes on me.

A year and a half ago, I met a new coworker. Her name (fictitious in this post) is Helena. We always got along very well. It was a friendship that was rapidly growing; we talked for hours on WhatsApp, between audios and texts, and we even went out a few times for coffee, lunch, and walks. For the first time in my life, I felt a confidence and fulfillment that I had never felt before. In doing so, without realizing it, I dedicated myself more and more to our relationship. And my way of showing affection was by getting involved in Helena's personal problems to help her find solutions, make our work more efficient with IT suggestions, etc. I didn't feel the need to spend nights or travel with her, normal demands for someone who is dating. The point is: in my head, we weren't dating, but we had a relationship of mutual trust, respect, and collaboration. In other words, the optimal point for me. Dream scenario.
Then today she sends me several audio messages saying that she is confused about our relationship and wants a definition of what we are. With great difficulty, and also because I was caught off guard, I explained that I didn't feel comfortable labeling it, and I would prefer to leave the future open, emphasizing that she was very special to me. She didn't accept it and said she's going to distance herself, which is her right. It's her life and she does what she wants with it.
The thing is, I'm devastated. I had never placed so much trust in someone. I don't know how to name the feelings, but maybe I fell in love for the first time. Now, there's a deafening emptiness left. I can't take this life anymore. Sorry for the outburst.",2,1768543348.0,autism,3,1.0,False

1qe81p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeltoiWellness/comments/1qe81p8/weight_loss_injections_and_pancreas_risk/,Weight loss injections and pancreas risk: separating fact from fear,"If you’ve Googled weight loss injections and pancreas risk, chances are you’ve scared yourself half to death before finishing your coffee. Between headlines, forums, and social media comments, it can sound like these medications are a fast track to pancreatitis.

The reality is far less dramatic.

This article breaks down what the pancreas does, where the concern came from, what the real risk looks like, and how this is safely managed in a proper medical setting like Keltoi.

No drama. No brushing things under the carpet either.



What does the pancreas actually do?

The pancreas is a small but very important organ tucked behind the stomach. It has two main jobs:

• Producing insulin to control blood sugar  
• Producing digestive enzymes to help break down food

When the pancreas becomes inflamed, this is called pancreatitis. It can range from mild and temporary to severe and serious.

Symptoms usually include:

• Severe upper abdominal pain  
• Pain radiating to the back  
• Nausea and vomiting  
• Fever  
• Feeling generally very unwell

Pancreatitis is not subtle. People generally know something is wrong.

Why are weight loss injections linked to pancreas concerns?

Weight loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro work on GLP-1 receptors. These receptors are involved in appetite regulation, blood sugar control, and digestive processes.

Because the pancreas plays a role in insulin production, early research raised a reasonable question:

Could stimulating GLP-1 receptors increase pancreatitis risk?

That question triggered years of study, review, and regulatory scrutiny. And that’s a good thing.

What does the evidence actually show?

This is the part that often gets lost online.

Large clinical trials and real-world data have not shown a meaningful increase in pancreatitis risk for the general population using GLP-1 medications.

Key points that matter:

• Pancreatitis remains rare  
• Rates are very low overall  
• Most cases occur in people with existing risk factors  
• No clear causal link has been established

Regulators continue to monitor this closely. These medications would not be licensed or widely prescribed if there were a significant undisclosed risk.

In simple terms: the risk exists, but it is small, uncommon, and not random.



Who is at higher risk?

Pancreatitis risk is not evenly spread. Certain factors increase baseline risk regardless of weight loss injections.

You may need extra caution if you have:

• A history of pancreatitis  
• Gallstones  
• Heavy alcohol use  
• Very high triglyceride levels  
• Certain metabolic conditions

Gallstones are worth a specific mention. Rapid weight loss can increase gallstone risk, and gallstones themselves are one of the most common causes of pancreatitis. That’s an indirect link, not a direct medication effect.

This is why medical assessment matters before treatment begins.

Why proper screening matters more than the medication itself

Most reported pancreatitis cases occur in people who already had underlying risk factors.

A proper clinic will:

• Take a full medical history  
• Ask about previous abdominal pain  
• Review alcohol intake honestly  
• Consider lipid levels if relevant  
• Monitor symptoms over time

This is not something that should be rushed or automated.

At Keltoi, this assessment happens before prescribing and continues during treatment. If something doesn’t feel right, the medication is reviewed, paused, or stopped. There’s no “just power through it” approach.



Symptoms you should never ignore

Most patients will never experience pancreas-related issues. But knowing what to watch for matters.

You should seek medical advice urgently if you develop:

• Severe or persistent upper abdominal pain  
• Pain that radiates to your back  
• Repeated vomiting  
• Fever alongside abdominal pain  
• Feeling acutely unwell

This is not something to sit on or Google for three days hoping it goes away.

Early assessment makes a huge difference.

Do weight loss injections need routine pancreas testing?

No.

Routine scans or blood tests are not needed for people without symptoms. That would expose patients to unnecessary investigations without benefit.

Testing is guided by symptoms, not fear.

This is another reason ongoing access to a clinician matters. You want someone who can make sensible decisions, not blanket rules.

The real risk comparison people forget

Here’s the part that often gets overlooked.

Obesity itself increases the risk of:

• Type 2 diabetes  
• Gallstones  
• Fatty liver disease  
• Cardiovascular disease  
• Pancreatitis

For many patients, reducing weight actually lowers long-term pancreatic and metabolic risk.

So the conversation isn’t “medication risk versus no risk”.

It’s risk versus benefit.

For most people, the balance strongly favours treatment when it’s properly supervised.

The bottom line

Weight loss injections are not risk-free. No medical treatment is.

But pancreas-related complications are rare, well-monitored, and usually linked to existing risk factors rather than the medication alone.

For the vast majority of patients:

• The risk is low  
• Symptoms are obvious if they occur  
• Early intervention prevents serious outcomes  
• The benefits outweigh the risks

The biggest dangers come from unsupervised use, rapid weight loss, ignoring symptoms, or sourcing medication without proper medical oversight.

That’s why Keltoi runs a doctor-led, concierge-style service rather than a hands-off prescribing model. Ongoing care is not an add-on. It’s the safety net.

If pancreas risk is something you’re worried about, the best step is a proper clinical conversation before starting treatment, and real support while you’re on it.",1,1768543290.0,KeltoiWellness,1,1.0,False

Especially interested in advice specifically on advisory practice: How are things particularly different from transactional work? My impression is that the disputes work usually happens on a longer horizon but individual tasks are much more intellectually harder than doing process driven work in for example a corporate seat.

My name is Max, I recently moved to Dubai, and I’ve reached that point in life where I realized something important:  
I’m 31, I have a kid, a beautiful wife… and I’m still a massive nerd.

I play a lot of PC games, watch way too many TV shows, love Marvel (yes, even the bad phases), occasionally tolerate DC, and somehow still manage to function as an adult human being.  
Yes, dudes, everything *is* possible.

Lately I’ve been thinking: instead of treating hobbies as something I “squeeze in” between responsibilities, I’d love to build something fun out of them. Not cringe hustle culture, not “buy my course” energy just real conversations, gaming, and maybe seeing where it goes.

I’d love to find someone to:

* Start a podcast about gaming, movies, TV shows, and occasionally life in general (think something chill like The Escape Pod Podcast vibe, deep dives, jokes, chaos, opinions)
* Possibly record gaming videos together and try to break that awkward “doing it alone” wall
* Be a partner in crime, not a flake, hold each other accountable and actually show up

Gaming-wise, I’m mostly into:

* Survival games: *7 Days to Die, Icarus, Conan Exiles*
* Occasional shooters: *Marvel, Rainbow Six Siege, Apex* (I enjoy them… until I randomly get bored)
* Totally open to trying new games if the vibe is right

I already have a small gaming YouTube channel 1.5k subs (not naming or promoting it here this isn’t an ad). This is more about finding the right person, not chasing numbers.

Dubai feels like a wild place to start something new, and I’d genuinely love to meet someone likeminded who wants to see if turning passion into something meaningful (and maybe sustainable) is possible.

If this sounds like you, or you just want to grab a coffee and talk games, movies, or life drop a comment or DM.

Worst case: we talk nerd stuff and find gaming friends  
Best case: we accidentally build something cool.

Fashion always finds a way to breathe new life into our tried-and-true favorites, and the denim jacket is proof that some styles never go out of fashion—they just keep getting better. Welcome to the world of the [**Top Denim Jacket Trends of 2026**](https://www.denzlabel.com/collection/denim-jacket-women), where creativity and character come together. If you love classic cool but crave something that feels fresh, this season’s updates on the denim jacket are designed with you in mind.

# Why the Denim Jacket Still Matters in 2026

Maybe your first denim jacket was a hand-me-down from an older sibling or a thrift store discovery. Denim jackets anchor so many memories—bike rides in spring, concerts on breezy nights, coffee runs that turn into long walks. They’re not just a layer to keep the chill away; they’re emotional staples, little reminders of times when style was something you made your own.

In 2026, this beloved piece is not just surviving—it’s thriving. Why? Because the latest trends take the reliable comfort of a denim jacket and fuse it with bold silhouettes, saturated washes, and unexpected accents. Whether you’re building a wardrobe around minimalism, chasing after maximalist color, or simply seeking a jacket to finish every look, denim’s adaptability ensures it’s always at the center of the conversation.

# 1. Go Big or Go Home: Oversized and Structured Silhouettes

One look at the **Top Denim Jacket Trends of 2026** and you’ll notice: size does matter. Oversized, boxy shapes have become more sculptural, with dropped shoulders and roomy sleeves offering both comfort and statement appeal. But unlike the slouchy fits of the past, 2026’s new crop balances volume with sharp tailoring—think DenZ’s structured shoulders or cinched waists that give you options for personalized styling.

This evolution means you can toss your denim jacket over a slip dress for a casual-cool contrast, or belt it for instant polish. The best part? These roomier silhouettes are as functional as they are fashionable, making them perfect for layering in unpredictable weather.

# 2. Unexpected Washes and Pops of Color

Move over, classic blue—denim jackets in 2026 are celebrating color. Alongside traditional indigos, we’re seeing bold choices like deep forest greens, washed pastels, and attention-grabbing acid washes. DenZ, a name that’s appearing more and more in fashion insider picks, is particularly known for its vibrant approach to denim jacket for women, offering everything from soft lavender hues to sun-bleached apricot.

Unique washes and treatments are the ideal way to add personality to your everyday look. With colored denim, you can build outfits that are anything but predictable—imagine pairing a pistachio denim jacket with cream trousers or going tonal with varying shades for a runway feel in real life.

# 3. Details That Make a Difference: Embellishment and Function

If there’s one thing the [**denim jacket** ](https://www.denzlabel.com/)is teaching us this year, it’s that details matter. From contrast stitching and raw hems to decorative patches, embroidery, and metallic hardware, little touches bring a big payoff. DenZ in particular is experimenting with multi-pocket designs, oversized buttons, and adjustable tabs to make the classic even more versatile and user-friendly.

These functional flourishes aren’t just for looks—they add utility. Snap pockets for your metro card, zippers to adjust the fit on the fly, and subtle reflective trims take the traditional denim jacket into 2026 with both style and purpose.

# 4. How to Wear the Latest Denim Jacket Trends

No matter your aesthetic, there’s a 2026 denim jacket with your name on it. Here’s how you can make the most of this season’s top silhouettes and details:

* Pair oversized jackets with slim or straight-leg pants for a balanced shape, or embrace volume by teaming with wide-leg jeans and boots.
* Layer colored or embellished denim jackets over basics like white tees or neutral knits to let the jacket stand out.
* For denim jacket for women, try belting a structured piece over a long skirt or mini dress for an easy, figure-flattering outfit.

Denim’s superpower is its flexibility. Mix washes, play with proportions, and don’t be afraid to wear your jacket in unexpected ways—over eveningwear, with tailored suiting, or swapped in for your go-to blazer.

# What to Look for When Buying a 2026 Denim Jacket

Before you add that new jacket to your cart, keep a few essentials in mind to ensure you’re investing wisely. The best options aren’t just on-trend—they’re built to last and designed with thoughtful details.

* **Quality Matters:** Check fabric weight, stitching, and hardware. High-quality denim won’t sag or lose its shape after a few wears.
* **Sustainability Counts:** Top brands like DenZ are ramping up ethical production and using recycled materials—worth seeking out if you want your fashion choices to reflect your values.
* **Personal Styling:** Choose colors, treatments, and fits that feel the most ‘you’. Whether that’s classic indigo, a playful pastel, or a heavily-embellished version, your jacket should reflect your personality and needs.

# Conclusion: Make the Classic Your Own

The **Top Denim Jacket Trends of 2026** are rewriting the rules. With innovative cuts, surprising colors, and details that blend flair with function, the denim jacket is more indispensable than ever—whatever ‘cool’ looks like for you.

Ready to refresh your closet—or maybe reclaim an old favorite with a new twist? Explore the latest from trusted brands, play with those washes and silhouettes, and remember: the best style is the one that feels like you.

1qe7x70,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThailandTourism/comments/1qe7x70/straight_talk_review_of_krabi_province_for_high/,Straight Talk Review of Krabi Province for High Season Tourists,"I am traveling in Krabi province now, in mid-January 2026, which is high season in this area. If you are seeing double trying to figure out what’s good and what’s not so good about Krabi province then read my feedback. Let’s be honest, feedback is subjective. My opinions are not the absolute truth, just my informed views from now having seen the area. You may disagree. But I am an experienced traveler and my goal is to set the right expectations because it’s easy to get seduced by pretty pictures and be misled about the reality, which is usually imperfect.

As they say, happiness is the gap between expectations and reality.

Let me start by saying that I am loving my travels in Southern Thailand. It is a unique and special part of the world that everyone should experience. Now here’s my feedback to help you make the right decision for your trip to Krabi province. The good and the bad.

1. Where to Base: Ao Nang is the best base. Ao Nang gets a lot of hate, and it’s easy to see why. It’s crowded and busy, but it’s still the best base for the area. After a long day on the beach or the islands you want a selection of restaurants to go to, rather than be forced to eat at your expensive resort, or be stuck in a quiet area with limited options. Ao Nang is very convenient. It has a wide selection of restaurants, a decent night market, some nice hotels, many convenience stores, live music, a stunning fire show on the beach, and is a good transportation base for the area. Let’s be honest: Ao Nang does not represent the best of Thailand, but don’t think twice about booking your stay in Ao Nang as your base if you want a convenient place to stay. For those of you who want more secluded resorts consider inland Krabi.

2. Food: Ao Nang does not have great food: The food is passable, and Kodam Kitchen is probably the best in the area, serving inexpensive, tasty Thai food, but it still pales in comparison to Bangkok restaurants. It gets busy, so be there by 6pm for less wait, otherwise expect to wait 20-40 minutes depending on the size of your group.

3. Early Start: Get an early start, whatever your activity. Start early to beat the crowds and the heat. Things really start picking up around 9AM, so try to get out earlier if you can to grab those 2 hours of peace, or that head start. Thailand is a peaceful pleasant country, but it’s hard to keep your mind in relaxed vacation mode when you’re surrounded by hundreds of loud tourists. Get a head start on them.

4. The Islands: The islands are mostly disappointing: I couldn’t wait to see the crystal blue waters and white sand beaches of the islands nearby, but what I got instead was the realization that the beautiful pictures are mostly photoshopped and filtered, and taken from very strategic angles. I was surprised to see popular destination islands be littered with trash and garbage dumps, like abandoned appliances, construction materials, and plastic bottles. I kept trying to rationalize that this is Thailand, not Hawaii, but I have to be honest, it was a major disappointment. Before you get offended, let me clarify that I traveled to Hong Island and Koh Landing. I have not seen Maya Bay or the Phi Phi islands or Koh Lanta. Maybe they’re better, but I would check out reviews before going, and always try to avoid the crowds.

That said, I really enjoyed the water travel across the Andaman sea. It’s stunning and beautiful and unique. Unfortunately I felt the islands are better seen at a distance rather than up close. I would also recommend avoiding the popular 4 island full day tour. It’s too long and too exhausting. Instead, break it up into two half days, you’ll thank me later. Finally, spend the extra money and hire a private long boat for your tour. It’s not that much more expensive than a group tour if you have several people in your party. Even if you’re solo or in a small group, hire a private boat anyway. Why ruin your islands trip being packed in with annoying tourists who aren’t behaving well? Be rich on the road and poor at home.

5. Tidal Water: Here now is probably the biggest thing they don’t advertise in the travel brochures: this area is tidal. The sea level rises and falls significantly, and your experience in some towns will vary greatly based on when you go. For example, Khlong Muang has a stunningly beautiful beach at high tide, but at low tide the beautiful beach is overshadowed by extensive unsightly seafloor. Similarly, if you visit Hong Island at high tide then you can visit the lagoon. At low tide you can’t. Before you book your excursions, go online and search for tide reports for the local area, and time your trip with high tide. Avoid most coastal places in the area at low tide.

6. Weather: Thailand is hot during the high season: I kept reading that the weather is pleasant and comfortable this time of year compared to others, and I completely believe this to be true. That said, it’s still really hot. Don’t underestimate this. Try to get your excursions done in the morning, especially if going to places like the Tiger Cave Temple. Also, while January may be the drier season, you can still get torrential rain like we did last night, for two solid hours during the prime time of the evening. Ao Nang’s streets are not designed to drain that much water and the streets turned into lakes and rushing torrents of water. Bring an umbrella with you if there is even a hint of possible rain in the forecast, and remember start times for weather events can be wrong. Lesson here: it still rains heavily during the drier season. And wear sandals with good grip if you think you’ll be out in the rain. The streets get really slippery.

6. Thailand is a 3rd world country: I was surprised at the level of poverty and rundown areas in between the higher end areas. Even the nice towns have sides to them that are unsightly and rundown. Take Khlong Muang, which looks stunning in pictures. The beach is undeniably beautiful at high tide, and there are a couple of really nice beach restaurants like The Boat Coffee Cafe and Restaurant. But in between the beachfront is rundown, and distressingly, there are many buildings and residences made of just sheet metal on wood framing, and little else. The area is really run down but you wouldn’t know it from the typical pictures. Khlong Muang is just one of many examples of selective positioning and avoiding the reality of how the area actually looks. So am I saying you should skip Khlong Muang? Not at all, but just keep your expectations realistic. Thailand is still a third world country and heartbreakingly, life appears to be very difficult for many of the locals.

7. Miscellaneous: I think 3 nights are the perfect amount of time to stay in Krabi province. You could even get away with 2 nights if you’re not trying to see everything. When arriving in Ao Nang, if you find yourself near the Last Fisherman Bar do yourself a favor and grab some food and drink there under the shade right on the beach. Service is spotty, but the location is beautiful, and just far enough removed from the crowds to bring a sense of peace.

That’s all for my feedback. Hope it is a useful addition to your research on Krabi province.",2,1768542903.0,ThailandTourism,1,0.75,False

If you aren't familiar, The Retreat is Celebrity’s ""ship-within-a-ship"" concept. You get a butler, a private restaurant (Luminae), and a sun deck that feels more like a Vegas rooftop club than a cruise ship. But here is the reality of doing it on the West Coast:

The ""Overkill"" Argument:
If you’re only on the ship for 72 hours, you barely have time to find the buffet, let alone use a butler. If your goal is just to party with friends and hit the bars in DTLA before you leave, a suite might be a waste of money you could’ve spent on shore in Victoria or Vancouver.

The ""Ultimate Flex"" Argument:
On the flip side, a short cruise is exactly when you should splurge. Why? Because the total price is way lower than a 10-day trip. You can live like a high-roller for 3 days for a fraction of what a full week would cost.

Plus, the boarding process is the real game-changer. While everyone else is waiting in line at the Port of LA, Retreat guests are usually escorted to a private lounge with snacks and chilled towels. If you’re only on vacation for three days, do you really want to spend four hours of it in a security line?

The Verdict?
If you’re celebrating a birthday or an anniversary and you live in Irvine or Long Beach, this is the move. It turns a ""quick getaway"" into a core memory. But if you’re just looking for a cheap place to sleep between port days in San Francisco, save your money.

If you’re torn, come hang out with us at the shop on Rosecrans. Alfonso or Lauren can pull up the actual price difference for 2026. Sometimes the ""move up"" cost is surprisingly low if you catch it at the right time.
What do you guys think? Is a butler for a 3-day trip too much, or is that exactly the kind of energy we’re bringing into 2026?

• Hug a cushion or pillow
• Sit with your back against a wall (just steady, not painful)
• Wrap a blanket around your shoulders for that cocoon vibe
At work / outside:
• Hold a warm cup of tea/coffee for a bit
• Notice the warmth, weight, smell
• Look around and name a few things you can see/hear

I’ve been doing my research combing through this sub, lots of reading, YouTube interviews and LEO channels (not body cam stuff but former and current LEOs talking about the job), local PD social media interviews. 

The staff didn’t seem convinced I knew enough about the day-to-day because I didn’t go on a ride along or talk to a cop 1:1. I think that’s fair but the local PD doesn’t offer ride alongs to the public and doesn’t have a dedicated recruiter - hence why I never been on a ride along. I know some other PDs have ride along for those actively in the hiring process and have recruiters to talk to. 

My advice is - FIND A WAY TO GO ON A RIDE ALONG. Even if the PD you’re applying for doesn’t offer it to the public - go to the HQ and ask to talk to someone. Or even go to another department that you’re not applying for and ask if you can participate for educational purposes. 

If you don’t know any cops personally, go to a community event where they have a tent up and spend 5-10 mins talking to them. Go to a “Coffee with a cop” event if you can. I’ve talked to some at tents but not a 1:1 interview…in hindsight, I should’ve said I did talk to cops personally about the job. 

You can do all the online research you can but you owe it to yourself and the PD to speak to a human being and observe them. I spent 7 weeks writing a whole notebook of values, modern policing, STAR interview prep, translating all my strengths and weaknesses into how it applies to law enforcement, even turning my notes into podcasts…but missed the big picture. 

So this is the lesson I learned after making it all the way to the chief and executive interview. I hope you guys can use this lesson learned to your benefit, especially those switching careers and don’t have easy access to a cop to talk to. 

I can still reapply for the PD in the future and can look at other local PDs as well when they have openings. In the end though, this was a positive experience still. I’ve gotten physically in even better shape but most importantly, understand the high standards the LEOs go through and appreciate that our PD picks the best of the best - even if that’s not me.

1qe7l2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1qe7l2h/the_difference_between_prayer_and_worship_and_why/,The Difference Between Prayer and Worship (And Why It Matters),"You know, I think most of us grow up confused about this. We learn to pray—usually as children, asking God for things we need or want—but nobody really explains what worship is. And honestly? Even the word ""worship"" sounds formal and distant, like something that happens in church buildings with organ music, not something that might be the most intimate thing you'll ever experience.

Let me share what I've come to understand, and maybe you'll recognize some of this in your own journey.

When I pray, I'm having a conversation. Think about prayer the way you'd think about talking with someone you love and trust. You come with your worries, your hopes, your confusion. You say, ""I don't know what to do about this situation"" or ""Please help my friend who's struggling"" or even ""I'm scared and I need courage.""

This is beautiful. This is real. This matters. And here's the thing—prayer actually works, but probably not the way we were taught to think about it.

I used to wonder if prayer was just... you know, talking to myself. Making myself feel better. And yes, prayer does help us psychologically. But that's not some weakness or admission that God isn't really there. Our psychology *is* spiritual. Our minds and spirits aren't separate things. They're deeply interwoven.

When you pray sincerely, you get clearer about what you're actually feeling. Have you noticed how sometimes you start praying about one thing and realize you're actually upset about something else entirely? imagine you're lost in a forest, spinning in circles. Prayer is that moment when you stop, breathe, and look up to see the sun. You're still in the forest, but now you have orientation. You shift from panic to perspective. You become more receptive to guidance from that fragment of God, that Divine Pilot, living within you, that presence closer than your own breath. And you access resources you didn't know you had—ever prayed for patience and then found yourself strangely calm in a situation that would normally make you crazy?

When you pray, you're not changing God's mind about you. You're opening *your* mind to what God has been offering all along.

But let's be honest: prayer isn't magic. It can't override physics or control other people. God doesn't override anyone's freedom, not even for your heartfelt prayers. And it's not a cosmic vending machine where you insert the right combination of words and get what you want. I know that sounds harsh, but I think we damage people's faith terribly when we teach them that, because then when tragedy comes—and it comes to everyone—they think God didn't answer, or they didn't have enough faith. Sometimes terrible things happen in a universe that's still growing toward perfection. Prayer doesn't prevent any of that. But it changes *you*, and you changing ripples out into the world in ways you can't possibly trace completely, but are absolutely real.

And then there is worship, which is something else entirely, If prayer is like having a conversation with someone you love, worship is like sitting quietly next to them, not needing to say anything at all, just being together. Content in their presence. Safe. Known.

A friend described it perfectly when she said, worship is ""sharing my inner life with the fragment of God that dwells already in me and every person."" Yes. Exactly that. And the Book clarifies: ""Prayer is certainly part of the religious experience, but modern religions have wrongly emphasized it, to the detriment of communion of worship which is more essential. The reflective powers of the mind deepen and expand through worship. Prayer can enrich life, but worship illuminates destiny."" (102:4.5)

Worship isn't singing hymns or being in a church building or following a ritual—though you can worship while doing any of those things. Worship is when you stop *doing* anything and just... are. With God. In you. As you.

You sit quietly. Maybe close your eyes. Maybe not. You're not trying to feel anything special. You're not asking for anything. You're not even thinking *about* God, really. You're just... aware. Present. Open. And in that openness, there's this sense—sometimes so faint you barely notice it, sometimes overwhelming—that you're not alone. Not in the sense that someone's watching you. In the sense that someone's *with* you. In you. Closer than close.

You might not feel anything at all. Often you don't, actually. It might feel like you're just sitting there, kind of bored, wondering if you're doing it right. But here's the secret: that wondering is your surface mind. Underneath, something is happening that your conscious mind can't track. It's like a seed growing underground before anything shows above the soil. Some call it superconsciousness.

The Urantia revelation calls worship ""effortless attention"" and ""restful spiritual exertion."" You're not straining or performing or trying to make something happen. You're just there. Attentive. Resting in divine presence. And that rest, that simple being-with-God, changes you at a level deeper than conscious thought. Prayer might help you decide what to do in a difficult situation, but worship makes you into the kind of person who naturally makes wise decisions. Prayer might give you courage for today's challenge, but worship grows courage into your character so you become brave.

So how do they work together? They're not in competition. They're partners. Think of it like a close friendship: sometimes you call because you need advice or you're upset—that's prayer. But sometimes you just sit together, having coffee or being quiet, feeling that deep connection that needs no words—that's worship. A healthy friendship has both.

So pray when you need to. When you're scared, confused, grateful, feeling beholden—talk to God like you'd talk to the most understanding, most loving person you can imagine. But also carve out time just to be together—even five minutes, even if it feels like nothing's happening. Sit quietly and let yourself be seen—really seen—by the divine presence that already knows everything about you and loves you completely the way you are right here and now.

Here's what I wish someone had told me years ago: worship probably won't feel like what you expect. You might expect dramatic feelings, visions, voices, overwhelming emotions. Sometimes that happens. But usually it's quiet. Subtle. Easy to miss if you're looking for fireworks. You might finish thinking, ""Well, that was nothing. I must be doing it wrong."" But then, hours or days later, you notice: you're more patient with your kids, with your friends, with your others. That situation that was driving you crazy doesn't bother you as much. You make a decision from a deeper place than usual. Something in you has shifted. That's worship working in you. Not dramatic. Just real.

The Revelation talks about how worship strengthens the soul—that emerging eternal self being created through our choices and experiences. You can't see your soul growing any more than you can see a tree growing. But it's happening, and worship accelerates that growth in ways nothing else can.

And what may this look like? Find a quiet spot—could be a chair in your bedroom, a corner of your living room, even sitting in your parked car. Sit down. Take a few breaths. Let the frantic energy settle. Then just be there. With the God of your own unique understanding, who is already within you. Who is always ready for this moment. You don't have to say anything or ask for anything or feel anything particular. Just share your inner life with that ever-loving presence, your real self, not the self you show everyone else.

Maybe you'll sense something. Maybe you won't. Either way, you're doing it right. Stay there for five minutes. Ten if you can. When your mind wanders, gently bring it back—not with effort or frustration, but gently, like you'd redirect a small child.

That's it. That's worship. Simple. Not easy, exactly, because sitting still is harder than we think. But simple.

If you do this regularly—praying throughout your day and worshiping in quiet moments—something shifts over time. Your prayers become less demanding and more trusting. Your worship deepens until those times that felt like nothing become the most real moments of your day. And slowly, almost without noticing, prayer and worship start to blend together until your whole life becomes a kind of worship—not because you're always being religious, but because you're carrying that sense of divine presence everywhere, living *with* God rather than reporting to God about it later. If you are like me, being ""religious"" has connotations that my mind steers away from.

If you've been hurt by religion, if you've been taught that prayer is about getting God to give you things or that worship is about groveling before an angry deity; that's not what this is. The God who dwells in you, as close as your next heartbeat, is not angry or distant or keeping score. That presence loves you. Not because of what you do or don't do. Just loves you. Period. As a matter of fact, that God forgives you even before you do things that need forgiveness. Why? That God knows that you are evolving and can not be perfect, but are striving towards perfection during all of your long journey back to Him or Her. Indeed there is a Mother God, and they are one.

You can come exactly as you are—messy, confused, broken, angry, whatever—and you'll be received with nothing but love. The sharing of your inner life with God isn't about performing or proving. It's about finally being fully known and fully loved at the same time.

That's what worship is. That's what we're made for. That deep communion with the divine reality that's been living in us all along, waiting so patiently for us to notice. And once you taste it—even just a glimpse—nothing else quite satisfies in the same way.

So keep praying. Talk over your needs. Be honest about your struggles and hopes. But also make space for worship, for that wordless being-together that changes everything. Your soul will thank you, and gradually, quietly, you'll become more yourself—your truest, deepest, most radiant self—than you ever imagined possible.

**Memory transcript subject: Thiva, Venlil Student**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 15th, 2136*

\---

With my plan to surprise Martin with his stuff completed, I just had to finish my modeling session. Which meant sitting still in the middle of a room full of humans all focusing on me. A chair had been set up in the center of the room. It was explained to me beforehand that professional human art models sometimes held poses for over an eighth of a claw, which just sounds insane to me. Thankfully since there were no professional models at the shelter, the standards were much less harsh, and time periods of ""one to five minutes"" were the most of it.

The teacher had grey fur on her head, and had donned sunglasses and a mouth-mask in lieu of a full-face mask like some others were putting on. But that still left six predators who simply didn't have any facial coverings at all, watching me with their penetrating, forward-facing gazes from every direction. Their focused and intense expressions unsettled me, and I tried to find a way to keep all six of them in my line of sight at once. In truth it wasn't that hard to get used to the eye positioning, because it's not like Venlil are incapable of looking at something with both eyes. It was the jerky way their gazes flickered around whenever they adjusted their vision. ""Saccades"", Martin had called it.

The sensation of having the humans' gazes flickering over different parts of my body was chilling, like they were hunting for a weakness. I had to fight to suppress the urge to flee, reducing it to a shiver instead.

""We usually start with 30-second poses for a few minutes, to let people limber up and get the eye of the form in."" The teacher said helpfully.

""I'm not sure how long that is, miss."" I answered frankly. ""Could you time it for me?""

""Of course, dear. You can begin whenever you are ready.""

 

I slowly inhaled and exhaled a few times, and fixed my left eye on the only familiar human in the room. I thought about the bombshell Interview. *They won't hurt you. No more than a Gojid, or a Krakotl, would. The Federation has lied to you all your life. They're not predators the way you understand the word. There may be no such thing at all. You are safer here than you ever were at home.*

I raised my arms out from each other, and dropped one leg out to the side. The humans started moving their hands, scratching on their papers. I focused on my breathing, and kept my focus on Martin. His expression was blank, yet determined and focused. I realized that I had seen it before, during our games. He stared at me right then the way he often stared at the chess board, like every part of his brain was focused entirely on the task at hand. And this time I was the task at hand. As the teacher called out ""Pose"", and I moved around to a bent-forward pose with one hand raised above my head, I hoped that nobody would question the orange flushing.

The teacher started pointing to parts of my body. ""Take note of the proportions, particularly of the legs. See how she stands on her toes? This entire section here is actually the foot, with this back protrusion being the ankle. See how the leg then curves forward again to the knee. Pose. Next, pay attention to the extremities. Four fingers, not five. And each one is thicker than ours are, relative to the paw. Also note how the fur is finer past the wrists, and the curvature and length of the claws. On the feet, again we see four toes, not five. Note the thickness of the last section of toes, and how her weight is distributed on the pads.

If you want more personal studies, I would suggest looking at canids for a comparison. Next, let's look at the head... Pose. Okay, so we see how the Venlil have a protruding snout. It is blunter than the snouts of most Earth mammals, due to the lack of a nose, but please note that it's still a rounded box shape that shrinks as it extends out from the circular skull. The snout may look soft but that is solid bone, and I think current science believes it to have been used by their ancestors to dig out burrows and forage for edible roots. Also note the short, fine fur of the face, with the wool framing it from the neck and up around behind the ears. Now for the ears... Pose.""

She continued like that, detailing my body with calm detachment while calling out for me to swap my positioning around. I didn't feel like prey being stared at by hungry predators as I had feared, or like a beautiful centerpiece being adored by her herd I had hoped. I felt like a living medical diagram. Eventually we moved onto the longer poses, where I'd often end up trembling from exertion before she called out for the next one. Sometimes she'd make specific requests like craning my head back to give everyone a look at my neck fluff, or asking me to hold an object to focus on how our paws flexed.

 

The supreme weirdness of the entire situation faded over the half-claw I spent with the human artists. I had to focus on staying stock still and maintaining the series of increasingly uncomfortable positions, so I didn't have any energy left over for being freaked out. Modeling is hard work! By the end of it I wasn't worried about my safety, or wondering if the humans could appreciate my beauty. I was just tired and my legs were aching, and when the teacher called for the end of the class I collapsed into a chair immediately. The teacher handed me a bottle of water (from which I started gratefully gulping down) and said ""Thank you for coming. We all appreciate it, and I think it meant a lot to Martin in particular. When you're done, come to the front desk and we'll pay you for your time.""

My ear flicked in a sign of agreement and acknowledgment, though I realized that the humans wouldn't recognize it so I added a nod of the head too before she left. I focused an eye on Martin. He had finished cleaning up his art supplies and was slowly looking through his travel bag, cataloging his stuff. Suddenly he froze still for a few seconds, then slowly raised the chess board. His eyes flicked over to me, before looking away again.

It was another short while before he rose up and walked over to me, oddly formal and careful to not look at me. ""So, Thiva... Thank you. You didn't need to do this.""

I wagged my tail happily and decided to be bold, fixing him with an eye until he looked back at me. ""I know. But I wanted to. Furthermore I think you should move in with me again.""

He hesitated for a while before responding. ""...Thiva, Vansi’s been blacklisted from the outreach program. The shelter’s suing her.""

""Who cares?""

A small shrug. ""Also I personally don’t want to live with someone who tried to have me incinerated.""

My ears turned up in a gesture of acknowledgment, and joy. ""Yeah, but I moved out. I live with my best friend now.""

He looked at me fully now, with wide-open eyes. A standard human look of surprise. ""You what?!""

""Yeah, the economy's down, so rent's really cheap right now.""

""No, I mean... aren't you a bit young to move away from home?""

At this I paused, flicking my tail-tip uncertainly. I knew humans stuck to their herds quite closely, but surely a mature adult who's in university could move out? We had discussed education briefly once and we found it interesting that it was the norm for both humans and Venlil to move to live at the university rather than commute every paw. His statement didn't make any sense! ""...Uh, Martin... how old do you think I am?""

**Memory transcript subject: Martin, Human Refugee**

*Date \[standardized human time\]: November 15th, 2136*

You should never make assumptions. You should always think through things carefully from every angle. Especially when it comes to aliens. And yet here I am.

Thiva's a bit short, for a Venlil. Maybe 135-140 centimeters or so. Her limbs are a bit lanky, not entirely unlike my own. And she has been saying that she's in school. Humans tend to graduate from school at age 18, and then optionally seek secondary education. I have no idea if wool and fur color has any connotation with age, or if it's analogous to skin tone, or what. She's the grey of a sheet of aluminum. So color probably doesn't matter here. She lives with her mother. Or rather, lived. Humans tend to move out once they achieve financial stability, upon finding employment after their education is over.

""Martin?"" Shit. She's still wanting an answer.

I go over all my data points again, before deciding that I simply don't have enough information to change my prior guess. ""...Well you don't count years the way we humans do. But in terms of physical development... I have been assuming you're in your mid to late teens?""

Her tail flicks with what I think is annoyance, and her ear perks at me. ""What does that mean?""

I try to stay neutral in my tone while I explain. ""A 'teenager' is someone whose age in Earth years is in the range between thirteen and nineteen. Eighteen is the legal age of adulthood for most humans cultures, and physical development continues until our early twenties.""

""...Martin, I'm \[Twenty\]. I have been an adult for years, and I’m studying engineering."" The translator helpfully spits out the number in human years. Thiva glares at me with one eye. It appears my assumption has upset her.

I stay still. School as in Education, as in University. Why the hell did I assume it was School as in High School? The scene feels awkward. ""Ah. We are roughly the same age, then."" Very awkward.

""Yes. Yes, we are."" Something about the slow and carefully enunciated way she says it makes me reconsider my interactions with her so far.

 

*So I might have been petting someone of my same age this entire time. Okay. On the other hand would it have been LESS creepy to cuddle an alien who has what may or may not be a crush on you if she were significantly younger? Isn't this actually the best case scenario? No: The best case scenario is that I kept my damn hands to myself. But that ship has sailed. I only ever meant it in the way you’d pet an animal; she’s soft and I’ve got dexterous fingers, so we both enjoy it and we both benefit. Purely platonic. Plus people online said that humans petting Venlil is really common. They can’t all be ‘Welsh’! But what about Thiva’s view of it? Do Venlil not platonically touch and groom each other? Have I been sending her signals? What kind of signals have I been sending? Where has she reacted strongly to me touching? Ears? Tail? The back of the neck? Are any of those spots that signify family, or romantic partners, or something? Or are they just sensitive?*

I shake my head briefly. Turns out brains and etch-a-sketches have a lot in common. Sometimes when they get cluttered you have to give them a good shake to reset them. *No. Disregard it. Focus on what matters. We're friends. She's here as a friend. If she's also into me that's a separate question that can be carefully packed into a suitcase to be unpacked at a more convenient time, like after I've carefully researched Venlil body language. Or never.*

I slowly inhale, and exhale, before speaking. She doesn’t need to know I’ve been speed-running a review of every interaction we’ve had so far. ""Alright, my apologies. Then you're of a good age to move out, and I... hope that the unpleasantness didn't hasten it.""

She laughs. ""Of course it did! But honestly only because I should've moved out earlier... So?""

*So? So what else was there? Oh right. The moving in thing. Shit.* ""I... think it would be a good idea to meet with your friend first, at the very least.""

She gives a flick of her ear that I've understood is conciliatory or agreeing. ""That's fair. So let's go do it.""

""Do what?""

""Meet Vilek. You'll love her, she's great! C'mon, let's go get second-meal, I'll treat you!""

“You mean right now?!” And why not? The only thing waiting for me here is searching couch cushions for board game pieces, sorting the second-hand clothing by size, swapping a couple hundred dirty bedsheets for clean ones, and brewing industrial quantities of the worst coffee known to man. None of my current chores are time-sensitive enough that I can’t take a bit of time off.

 

I end up dragged along to the reception, where Thiva gets paid. Rose is working the desk today; while you can’t see the face of the reception due to the need for a mask in public-facing positions, the hair’s a dead giveaway. I remind her that the Venlil technically did nude modeling. Thiva’s pay doubles. It's not a huge amount, but it'll pay for a meal out with cash to spare. I borrow a cheap cloth mask from a small bowl by the desk, to hide my features. I don't deposit my backpack in my room, having just gotten it back I find myself loathe to leave it out of reach.

“Hey Rose, I’m going to head out to meet with someone about… well about moving out again I guess.”

Rose turns to look at me with surprise. “Really? Even after last time?”

“Yeah, I know. Call it eternal optimism. Don’t worry, it probably won’t amount to anything. But even if it does I’ll still show up to help around each day. Oh, right! It’s Elsa’s eighth birthday. She’s Hans’ kid. So I was thinking once I get back we’d make a couple of brownies for her and her friends?” Even knowing that I’m freeing up resources for the rest, the very idea of moving out again feels like a betrayal. What right do I have to do so well that I can move on with life when so many others here are still doing so much worse?

She taps the desk a few times, thoughtfully. “Do we have any applesauce left for it?” Sugar-free applesauce is the shelter’s go-to egg substitute for baked goods. I miss not being forcibly vegan. I wonder if the Venlil will ever adjust enough to our omnivorous diets to let us keep chickens.

“Yeah, we should have enough for a couple batches. There’s two more kids’ birthdays coming up, so I’ll divide it up evenly and we’ll see how much we end up with. After that we’ll be left to source a replacement locally.” I didn’t ever bake before coming to Venlil Prime, but it turns out everyone loves freshly baked treats. And as a time-intensive endeavor that stretches the pantry supplies of raw ingredients, it’s perfect for volunteer work.

“Maybe you can ask the Venlil what they do for baking?” Rose snapped her fingers. “Oh, right! Did you hear about the news?”

I haven’t been on the internet since I got out of lockup. “No, what news?”

Thiva stamps her foot, her voice a bit impatient. “Martin.”

I smack my forehead lightly. “Right, I’m being rude. Sorry, Thiva. I’ll be back later, Rose!”

“Bye Martin, good luck!”

 

With a spring to her step, Thiva asks me as we head out the doors. ""So why does nude modeling pay better?""

I answer the question as clearly as I can. ""Because we don’t have any fur concealing our private areas like the Venlil do, so we use clothing instead. Most human cultures are generally private about nudity, as being around someone without clothes is considered very intimate and vulnerable, often in a romantic or sexual way.""

She gives a coy sway of her hip and a long, exaggerated wag of her tail. ""Oohhh. So hanging out with me being nude all the time...""

""...is completely different because you're a Venlil."" I say, firmly. ""Nudity doesn't have any of the same implications or connotations to you."" I batter my thoughts away from the fact that while I lived with Thiva I regularly ended up with a naked girl in my lap, squeaking and mewling from my touch.

*Sweet Mary mother of God, Martin, you were fine with it earlier, you can be fine with it again. It's not like that. It’s only weird because you've got hangups and now you're second-guessing everything. Man up!*

I hope meeting with Thiva's roommate will go smoothly and easily. I’ll be on high alert for red flags: I don’t want another Vansi situation on my hands.

I miss the art of actual conversation and exchanging thoughts with someone over time. I want to talk about the big stuff and the little stuff: your weird dreams, the song you can’t stop playing, that random memory that popped up today, your theories on life, or what you had for breakfast. I want to trade stories, book/music recommendations, and glimpses into our totally different (or surprisingly similar) worlds.

A little about me: I’m into photography, over-analyzing movies and TV shows, true crime podcasts, trying to keep plants alive, and finding the best iced coffee. I’m a good listener (reader?) and value honesty, curiosity, and kindness above all.

I’m open to connecting with anyone, anywhere, of any gender. The only requirements are that you’re respectful, genuinely interested in a consistent back-and-forth, and okay with starting slow and seeing where a friendship naturally goes.

If you’ve also been craving a meaningful, no-pressure written friendship, please send me a DM! Tell me about the last thing that made you genuinely laugh.

So I have recently got into steaming milk using the Delonghi Dedica 885, and I haven't felt like I grasped the steaming part so well, despite following videos and listening to the milk. My milk is not screaming at me anymore, which is an accomplishment itself.

My issue is (and forget about latte art, that's another struggle) that since I started using Al Marai full fat (long life) yesterday, all 3 cups of steamed milk I made had a nice foamy top in the pitcher, but the moment I put it in the coffee, the foam disappears within a minute.

I tried the barista one obviously and it's easier to work with obviously. But I do not always find it in the grocery store near the house, so it's a matter of convenience. And I might have had better results with the Fresh Milk one on the bottom left but I guess that's expected.

So is it normal for the Long Life milk to act this way once steamed and I am not doing it very wrong? I was even steaming powdered milk and had better results 😂

What do you guys usually use for milk drinks? Should I just stop buying any long life milk that is not specifically made for latte drinks?

It was an hour interview and originally, I was supposed to meet with the VP from 1-1:30PM then with 2 directors from 1:30-2PM. I got an email this morning saying the VP is sick and won’t be able to interview and the two directors would be separate - one at 1-1:30 then the other at 1:30-2PM. 

I joined the call at 1PM and no one was there. I waited until about 1:35PM and was caught off guard when both of them joined. I mentioned I was confused about what happened and they said they read the times wrong and apologized. 

Since they already joined the call a little late, the interview went a little past 2PM but one of them even left the meeting early because she said she had to jump to another meeting. I’m a little disappointed and annoyed because they barely asked any questions (maybe 3?). 

I had a coffee chat with one of the interviewers back in November and I messaged her through LinkedIn to send a thank you note basically thanking her for her time and said I enjoyed our conversation even though it was limited. I said I’m open to providing more information.

She replied with that she enjoyed the conversation and said it’s usually not how they operate at the company then she said: “Even though our time was limited today, I think we were both were able to ask all of the questions on our lists, but we will reach out if we think of anything.” - is this good or am I cooked? 😓

I also emailed the recruiter stating what happened and said if any additional interviewing is needed, I’m happy to share my availability.

1qe77qh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qe77qh,Development process,"VUJA 010 Style Mud-Dyed Distressed Dark Coffee Washed Black/Grey Jeans / Pre-Sale Notes

The cut is great and versatile. Countless Chinese streetwear brands have copied this style, but they all just imitate the look.

I'm the only one who has completely replicated the original's quality, craftsmanship, and details.

Multiple washes made the color of these jeans difficult to match, requiring constant trial production. Many pairs of jeans were wasted initially, but thankfully, they were all successfully made.

Made by a top-tier denim factory, the workmanship and quality are excellent. Classic, timeless style, a must-have for commuting and your wardrobe.

Product Introduction:

1｜Multi-Layer Wash

Using a multi-stage composite washing process, rather than a single wash.

A black base layered with greyish-brown natural distressed details, creating irregular layers.

Distinct color variations under different lighting conditions.

The mud-dy effect on the jeans is identical to the original, perfectly replicating the natural texture.

2｜Straight Leg Fit

The straight leg silhouette combined with the front and back drape ensures stable drape when standing and walking.

The cut doesn't deliberately pursue width; vertical lines elongate the proportions. Enhanced Overall Harmony

3 | High-Density Cotton Denim

Made from medium-to-high weight cotton denim fabric, maintaining excellent structure and support even after washing.

While ensuring comfort, it withstands complex washing layers without sagging or deformation.

4 | Distressed Finish

Natural frayed edges are used on the hem, pockets, waistband, and body, not artificially cut.

5 | Hardware Introduction

Fully made in Japan (YKK). This brand is well-known, with high-end lines made in both Japan and Italy.

Original factory hardware saves time on mold creation for fonts and shapes, reducing the order cycle to two months.

Fortunately, everything is original factory-made, including small nails. Even the nail-making molds are original factory-supplied and expensive.

She needed help taking care of her grandfather with dementia and the house and I had a rough living situation so it was kinda a win win situation. After I moved in I was really easy on her about the cleaning responsibilities bc she was grieving her mother and had a lot to do to deal with that like the paper work and such but now, a year and a half later, she still does very little cleaning, will leave dirty clothes in the living room and kitchen, let the dishes pile up and won’t cleanup after her cats. Her bf started out being very helpful around the house with dishes and cleaning up the living room but has since stopped and has decided the mess is my fault and i don’t do enough despite the fact that I clean majority of the house, do my own dishes, cook dinner everynight and all the grocery planning for the whole house. He keeps coming home and well see something small like a mug on the coffee table in the living room i haven’t finished and will dump it out or will start slamming doors in a fit of rage bc i asked him to stop leaving his spit in the sink. I had a conversation with my friend about how I need help with the cleaning and I thought it went well but 2 weeks later it was the same thing over again and I had to clean the whole house again. Today I was cleaning the common areas again and Since it’s winter and the bf was out to run and grab something from the store but he wasn’t going to be long, I made the mistake of putting the full trash bag next to the door instead of going all the way outside in shorts and the trash bag blew over and made a mess in the yard. Instead of telling me it did that since i had no idea, he proceeded to come in the house yelling and slamming doors and going on and on about how i don’t do enough in the house and it’s just ridiculous with the way i act. I’ve told my friend a million times to leave this man since his communication needs some work and I think his temper is a problem but she won’t.  I can tell he wants me to leave since he’s been being a complete d\*ck to me but like i don’t have anywhere else to go and I can’t afford to live on my own. I can’t keep having the same conversations over and over again just be disappointed. what do i do? I want her to help with the cleaning and he’s also a problem now which he wasn’t a few months ago.

1qe74g1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RYO/comments/1qe74g1/my_experience_with_flavoring_tobacco_and_making/,My experience with flavoring tobacco and making clove rolling tobacco,"Hello everyone, I've done a fair bit of tinkering with flavoring tobacco and am making a lengthy post to help others who wish to do the same. Trying to find info on how to do some of the things I've gotten into has been hard so I'm going to do my best to make a helpful organized post.

 

GENERAL GUIDELINES:

The method I generally use for flavoring my tobacco is to wet it with something and then let the tobacco dry. First I spread the tobacco out on some foil I try to carefully drizzle the liquid on it. If it's a dried out pouch of tobacco I'm trying to save then I might just drizzle in the pouch. After this I mix the tobacco by hand and possibly give a very gentle squeeze as I grab it to try to even things out with the flavoring. Then sometimes (when I'm feeling patient) I will let the tobacco sit  to allow the flavors to infuse. Best results would probably be for a day or a night but it could be shorter. Most of my recent batches have zero time to sit and still taste good. Next I let it dry by air on foil, turning every hour to few hours to try to keep things even. this usually takes up to 2 hours to a day. If you don't have a long enough chunk of time to stay home with your tobacco keeping it out for a bit and then resealing is probably going to do more good than bad. Slowly drying the tobacco is preferable but again, I have that patience issue.

If I'm using citrus peel to flavor my tobacco I just leave it in the container over night with the peel mixed in. This probably doesn't need to infuse after removing the peel since it happened slowly. This will need to dry after.

Vanilla extract I sometimes infuse by wetting some on a cotton ball that sits on top of the tobacco in a container. This works with other strong things that are in smelly liquid form but I haven't tried any of them.

Sugar burning is not the same as sugar in your drink. There is some sweetness added by sugar but it mostly just tastes like burning sugar when there is a lot of it. Your not going to taste most of the sugar in your smokes and adding more will make them taste bad and clog up.

THINGS THAT HAVE WORKED OUT WELL:

Clementine/orange peel are first to be mentioned and for a reason, I really like what they do. I initially found out about adding these tobacco to rehydrate it. It leaves a bit of a zesty citrus flavor that's stingy in a good way. The difference between a clementine and an orange in a cigarette is pretty similar to the taste difference while eating one.

Maple syrup adds a wonderful maple flavor, use incredibly sparingly (like I'm talking a  teaspoon per 1/2lb) and dilute.

Vanilla extract is the fucking shit. I love the stuff. Use super sparing though. maybe put 1-3 drops per tobacco pouch.

Molasses leaves a nice flavor. Still haven't figured out quite how much to use. The sweetness doesn't come through too much. Mostly just leaves a bit of a molasses flavor but minus the sugar. So malty with a  bit of sharp twang. Didn't really enjoy it without cloves but with cloves it's good. Try a little bit of it before adding and remember how I felt about maple syrup quantities.

Bourbon leaves a nice okay bourbon flavor. Imagine bourbon without the alcohol. Haven't had this in years since I don't drink these so I could be off. I remember doing something with rum but that was far back enough that I don't remember enough to write in depth on it.

Coffee worked really well  but I don't think I'm gonna do it again since I don't really like coffee. Dump a little coffee on your tobacco and it tastes like coffee. Complements the tobacco quite nicely.

THINGS I DON'T RECOMMEND 

Arizona iced tea fucking ruined my tobacco. Iced tea tastes really weird in a cigarette.

Coca cola tastes good but is probably not safe to smoke.

CLOVE INTRO

I have never tried using ground cloves in a cigarette and there's probably a reason for that.Also a clove cigarette is just a cigarette with cloves in it, very simple. The cloves I've been using are just a jar of store brand whole clove I got at whole foods. I love clove cigarettes. Making them is simple. The ratio I know as a starting point is 2 cloves per cigarette. I saw by eye the amount of ground clove per amount of tobacco going in the cigarette and guestimate if I have enough processed clove based off that. You can always try it and add more but you can't add less. Ceylon cloves are supposed to be the best and I will soon get some.

BUT HOW DO I PROCESS THE CLOVES

I generally pluck the ball off with my finger, put it in something, and then drop the stem in my mortar. I do this however many times I have to depending on the amount of tobacco and the amount of clovey I want. I then grind the stems until a rollable consistency is reached. After this I put in the balls and lightly crush until rollable. For larger batches I imagine a coffee grinder would work well but I don't have one. This is then mixed in with the tobacco.

THE OTHER FLAVORS YOU SEEK IN YOUR CLOVE CIGARETTE 

Dark and sweet flavors work well to complement the clove. Today i found orange peel does too though. Generally a few flavors added to the tobacco other than the clove will give nice clovey vibes. Just make some flavored tobacco with flavors you think would pair well together in a clove cigarette.

FINAL THOUGHTS

Be safe with what you add to your cigarettes but think of what you want in a cigarette. what pairs well with the tobacco. Think of flavors together and try them out. Google before adding things though, it's safest to check if it's something that is already used to add to tobacco and is safe to inhale.

TLDR: Stick an orange peel and a cotton ball wetted with vanilla extract in your tobacco for the night then let it dry",1,1768540384.0,RYO,0,1.0,False

I’ve been a home brewer for a while, but I always found myself fumbling with the calculator app on my phone half-asleep, trying to figure out the water weight for an 18g dose. Worse, I kept forgetting which grind setting or temperature I used for that *one* perfect cup I made last week.

So, I spent the last few months building a dedicated web app to solve this for myself, and I decided to open it up for free to the community.

It’s called **Ratiocraft**.

**What it does:**

* **Smart Calculator:** You put in your dose and method (V60, Aeropress, etc.), and it gives you the exact water weight and steps instantly.
* **Digital Coffee Journal (For Registered Users):** This is the big one. You can upload your coffee batches (photos of the bag, origin info) and rate them.
* **Brew Logging:** For every batch, you can log your daily brews. Take notes on taste, rate the cup, and record your variables.
* **The Goal:** To build a personal history of what you drank so you **never buy bad coffee twice** and—more importantly—so you can actually replicate that ""God Shot"" consistently instead of guessing.

**Why I built it:** I wanted something that looked clean, loaded fast, and worked right in the browser without needing to download an app store file.

**I’d love your feedback:** It’s still a work in progress (currently obsessing over adding ""Binocular Dripper"" tech), but I’d love to know if the logging flow feels intuitive to you.

1qe71vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1qe71vy/cut_off_block_or_talk_to_these_friends/,"Cut off, block, or talk to these friends.","So I've noticed that many of the people I once called ""close friends"" are kinda low effort in a lot of ways. Two friends in particular. 

One of them will text me, start a conversation, and the moment I respond, she disappears. And it always takes me by surprise. As she texted me a major life update, I asked her about it because I wanted to learn more. I have not heard from her in a month. 

Sometimes she'll invite me to a party, but I'm an introvert and not always emotionally able to be in large groups, especially when I'm dealing with a lot. But when she invites me, if I don't go, I'll also suggest something else like ""Hey lets grab coffee and catch up."" She rarely responds. 

And I know our social energies are different; she enjoys partying, and I enjoy more chill, low-key hangouts, but last year she sent me this text saying I was a ""low effort friend who only pops up when it's convenient to me."" And it hurt because I'm the one who will try to keep a conversation going, or if I say no to plans, I try to follow up with an alternative so we can still hang out. 

The last time she invited me to a party, I went because I knew she'd be mad if I didn't go. She wanted me to spend the night, but I wanted to go home, and I could tell she was upset at that. 

I let her text go for a bit, but after her not responding to a conversation she started, it crept back into my head. 

  
The other friend, we had made plans for last Thursday. She had even texted me what we should do. I sent her a list of options, and she reacted with a like to my response and then never responded. I wondered if maybe we had miscommunicated about which Thursday, so I waited a week. Never heard from her. Sent her a message asking her if something happened. It's not the first time she's done something like this, either.

Honestly, I know I'm an introvert, and I don't always have the energy to do big things like a party or go to some major event, but I do care deeply for my friends, and sometimes it feels like they take me for granted. Like they can pick me up when they feel like it, and then put me down for months. 

I'm not saying friends need to be in constant communication, but if you start a conversation, you shouldn't ghost that conversation, and if you start planning a hangout, not responding or following up just feels uncaring. 

I'm not sure if I should just cut them off, but keep them on social media, block them completely, or try to have a conversation with them. These are friends I've known for 4+ years, so this lack of communication feels personal even if it's not.",1,1768540169.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1qe71b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/VIPHealthClub/comments/1qe71b1/water_works_the_surprising_science_behind/,Water Works: The Surprising Science Behind Hydration and Why You're Probably Doing It Wrong,"We've all heard it a thousand times: ""Drink eight glasses of water a day."" But here's the truth—that advice is outdated, oversimplified, and might not even apply to you. Hydration is far more nuanced than we've been led to believe, and understanding the real science can transform how you feel, perform, and age.

## The Hydration Myth We All Believe

The ""8x8 rule"" (eight 8-ounce glasses daily) has no solid scientific backing. It likely originated from a 1945 recommendation that included water from food—a detail that got lost in translation. The reality? Your hydration needs depend on your body size, activity level, climate, diet, and even your genetics.

Recent research shows that **thirst is actually a remarkably accurate indicator** for most healthy adults. Your body has sophisticated mechanisms—osmoreceptors in your hypothalamus—that detect even tiny changes in blood concentration and trigger thirst before you're truly dehydrated.

## When Water Becomes Medicine

While chronic mild dehydration won't kill you, it can significantly impact your quality of life:

**Cognitive Performance**: Studies show that losing just 1-2% of body weight through fluid loss impairs concentration, increases fatigue, and worsens mood. For a 150-pound person, that's only 1.5-3 pounds of water weight.

**Physical Performance**: Dehydration of 2% or more can reduce endurance by up to 30% and strength by 10-20%. Athletes know this, but weekend warriors often ignore it.

**Kidney Function**: Your kidneys need adequate water to filter waste effectively. Chronic under-hydration increases the risk of kidney stones by up to 50% and may contribute to chronic kidney disease over time.

**Skin Health**: While drinking water won't erase wrinkles, proper hydration does improve skin elasticity and appearance. Dehydrated skin shows fine lines more prominently and heals slower.

## The Overhydration Danger Nobody Talks About

Here's what the wellness industry won't tell you: **you can drink too much water**. Hyponatremia (low blood sodium) from excessive water intake is rare but serious, causing confusion, seizures, and in extreme cases, death.

This typically happens during endurance events when people drink large amounts of plain water without replacing electrolytes. But it can also occur in people who believe more water is always better and force themselves to drink beyond thirst.

## Practical Hydration Strategies That Actually Work

**1. Use the Urine Test**: Your urine should be pale yellow. Dark yellow suggests you need more fluids; completely clear means you might be overdoing it.

**2. Front-Load Your Day**: Drink 16-20 ounces within 30 minutes of waking. You're naturally dehydrated after sleep, and morning hydration jumpstarts metabolism and mental clarity.

**3. Eat Your Water**: About 20% of daily fluid intake comes from food. Cucumbers, watermelon, oranges, and soups are 85-95% water. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables significantly contributes to hydration.

**4. Match Activity to Intake**: Add 12 ounces of water for every 30 minutes of moderate exercise. For intense workouts over an hour, consider electrolyte drinks.

**5. Consider Your Coffee and Tea**: Contrary to popular belief, moderate caffeine intake (up to 400mg daily) doesn't significantly dehydrate you. The water in coffee and tea counts toward your daily intake.

**6. Adjust for Environment**: Hot weather, high altitude, and dry indoor air all increase fluid needs. If you're traveling or in unusual conditions, increase intake by 20-30%.

## The Electrolyte Equation

Water alone isn't enough for optimal hydration—you need electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium) to help your body actually absorb and use that water.

For most people eating a varied diet, food provides adequate electrolytes. But if you're exercising intensely, sweating heavily, or following a very low-sodium diet, you might need supplementation. A pinch of sea salt in your water or electrolyte tablets can make a real difference.

## Special Populations

**Older Adults**: Thirst sensation decreases with age, making older adults more vulnerable to dehydration. If you're over 65, don't rely solely on thirst—set reminders to drink regularly.

**Pregnant and Nursing Women**: Fluid needs increase by about 24-32 ounces daily during pregnancy and even more during breastfeeding.

**People with Certain Conditions**: Kidney disease, heart failure, and some medications require modified fluid intake. Always follow your healthcare provider's specific recommendations.

## The Bottom Line

Hydration isn't about hitting an arbitrary number—it's about listening to your body, understanding your individual needs, and making smart choices based on your lifestyle.

Stop forcing yourself to chug water you don't want. Stop feeling guilty about that morning coffee. Start paying attention to how you actually feel, what your urine looks like, and what your body is telling you.

**Medical Disclaimer**: This information is for educational purposes only and is not intended to replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult with a qualified healthcare provider before making significant changes to your hydration habits, especially if you have underlying health conditions or take medications that affect fluid balance.

I don’t have much time before the light from this screen is the only thing I have left, and honestly, I don’t know if I want to see what happens when it goes dark. I’m posting this here because I need someone to know. If you ever find yourself in a place that feels wrong—where the silence isn't just quiet, but heavy, like it’s pressing against your eardrums—pay attention. The air here smells like a burnt circuit board, thick with ozone, and the shadows aren't staying where they belong. Living like this, under the constant weight of ""The Rules,"" isn't living at all. It’s a slow, agonizing erosion of your mind. A simple hallway isn't just a hallway anymore; it’s a gauntlet, and every step I take feels like a gamble with my soul. It all started with that damn folder.

I found it tucked into a kitchen drawer, a plain manila folder with a single word scrawled across the tab in shaking script: Inklistrad. Inside was a single sheet of paper, typed but stained with what looked like old coffee—or maybe something darker. It looked so mundane, like a list of apartment complex regulations, but the air in the room curdled the moment I picked it up. I laughed at first. I’m not laughing now.

THE PROTOCOL

1. Do not look directly at the man standing at the end of the hallway.
2. Maintain focus on the floor or the side walls at all times when traversing the space.
3. If you feel eyes on you, do not acknowledge them.
4. MOST CRITICAL: You are never, under any circumstances, allowed to look at him if you perceive that he is smiling.

The arbitrary nature of it is the worst part. There’s no ""why,"" no explanation of who he is or what he wants. It just establishes a hierarchy where you are the prey and the environment is the predator. The moment I finished reading Rule #4, a lightbulb in the corridor popped. In the sudden, jarring dimness, I felt a drop in temperature so sharp it made my skin crawl. I realized then that I wasn't alone.

The hallway has stretched. I know the dimensions of this house, but looking down at my feet, the carpet seems to pull away into an impossible distance, a liminal trap that defies the floor plan. He is always there, right at the edge of the shadows where the hallway meets the bathroom door. I can’t look at him—I can't—but my peripheral vision is a curse. I see a tall, jagged silhouette that seems to drink the light around it.

The physical toll of ""not looking"" is a torture I wasn't prepared for. My neck is constantly locked, the muscles cramped and screaming from forcing my gaze downward. My eyes burn from staring at the carpet patterns, and there is a primitive, animalistic urge to look up, to confront the threat, that I have to crush every single second. The air around him vibrates with a low-frequency static that makes my teeth ache, and I can hear his breathing—a wet, ragged sound that feels like it’s being whispered directly into my ear canal. He doesn't have to move. His stillness is a weapon. He's just waiting for my willpower to snap.

The shift happened about twenty minutes ago. I was trying to make it to the bedroom, my eyes fixed on a specific cigarette burn in the hallway runner, when the static in the air spiked until I tasted copper. In the corner of my eye, the shadow didn't just move—it unhinged.

The entire silhouette seemed to tilt into a new, sickening shape. I didn't see a face, but I saw the smile. It was a jagged fracture in the darkness, a flash of impossible, tombstone white that suggested way too many teeth. It wasn't a human expression; it was a display of predatory joy. The smell of ozone became a physical weight, a metallic sting that made my lungs seize. The smile is the catalyst. It’s the signal that he’s done watching. He’s hunting now.

And then, I slipped.

A second lightbulb shattered right above my head, and in that split-second of pure, instinctive terror, my gaze flicked upward. I didn't see him clearly, but I saw enough. I broke the primary directive, and reality simply... curdled.

\* Spatial Decay: The hallway didn't just lengthen; it warped. The floral wallpaper patterns began to stretch and twist until they looked like long, thin fingers reaching for my hair.

\* The Needle-Cold: The temperature plummeted so fast that the air turned into needles in my lungs. Every breath I take now comes out in a thick, ghostly mist.

\* The Sound of the Approach: For the first time, I heard a footstep. Not the distant sound of a house settling, but a heavy, wet thud on the carpet. Then another. He’s not at the end of the hall anymore.

By looking, I gave him permission to move. I traded the safety of distance for a moment of curiosity, and now the distance is gone.

I’m in my bedroom now, leaning my back against the door, but it’s a joke. I can feel the wood vibrating. There’s no doorknob turning—not yet—just the weight of something immense and cold leaning back against me from the other side.

The rules weren't there to help me understand. They were there to keep the truth out. Curiosity in this place isn't a virtue; it’s a death sentence, and I just signed mine. I can hear the wood of the door frame beginning to groan.

I’m telling you this because you need to understand: if you’re reading this and you notice your hallway looks a little longer than it did five minutes ago, or if you smell ozone and hear a wet, ragged breath behind you—do not look up.

The man is smiling. And I don’t have to look to know he’s standing right behind me. Though, i’ll be fine. As long as i dont look at him. Even though he’s laughing in my neck.",11,1768540071.0,nosleep,0,0.87,False

I make around 220 Avg and 240+ on a good day with Full set of Java Breeze Fully Upgraded 

•Do not waste your Diamonds on anything until you buy your Java Machine and Grinder, you can buy some other stuff if you want to but The Java Machine and Grinder are the best machines and will make you a lot of money also I am telling you you to buy em first because Diamonds are really hard to get.

•That brings me to my 2nd tip always play with network On! (Don't worry this game only had optional ads) Because you need to watch ads to get diamonds there's no other way to get them Consistently.

•DO NOT waste your Coffee tokens on Normal Machine or The Luxe 360 they are not worth it, save em all for both the Javas, they are thr best F2P Machines and Coffee tokens are limited and hard to get unless there's an event or something.

•Now Whenever you end a day ALWAYS remember to Check your machines because they get broken every 4-5 In-game days and if they get broken you will get less money or your machine won't function properly which will also lead to less profit, so just always check if any of your 2 Machines need Repairs.

•Use your Funds to buy all the upgrades first they will help you a ton and just improve your Experience overall 

Here's the order I suggest you to buy em but feel free to buy whichever one you feel like you need more

1. Mascot (Will Basically just double the amount of customera you get in a day, but he takes salary but not much just 5$)

2. Patient Customers (This as it says will make the customers more patient so they will lose the patience bar slower which is a very big deal because the less patience they lose the more tips you get and tips are your best friend! They are like 20% of your Daily Income)

3. Longer Days (This will make your days ladt 2 hour longer which means you can get more customers and more Profit)

4. Measuring Cup (This will add measurement lines on your Glasses which  Was very useful but not now because you now don't need to Scale anything you can just add espresso first and put everything else later and it will still be perfect but if you're a perfectionist (like me 😎) then this is your best friend)

• Now how about some In-game tips? First of all try NOT to Multi-Task because you will just Burn yourself (And The coffee) because it's not much beginner friendly so at first you might earn less money but it's totally ok, first just try to learn and perfect every skill like Extracting Espresso, Grounding Beans, Streaming Milk etc.. you can always learn to Multi-Task later when you perfect your skills individually if you try it from the start you will burn yourself out.

• Now when you have Mastered your Individual skills, you should NOW start Multi-tasking.

So first just start simple like Pouring Milk in the pitcher while the Coffee is pouring in the cup, then later try some harder like Whole The milk is streaming you add your syrups in your drinks and prepare for it and slowly but surely you will become good at multitasking and don't be sad that you're not perfect because no one is I myself mess up quite a lot

• Now here's what you should NOT try to  Multi-Task, Never try to Steam milk while you're brewing Espresso, because once you start Streaming Milk you can't control your Espresso anymore so if you do try you will just end up Brewing a lot more and Burning your milk 🫠 so never try that (I had to learn it the hard way 😊)

• Now let's come to the main part y'all are here for STREAMING MILK now streaming milk can be very hard at first and might even mkar you feel overwhelmed but trust me when you understand it correctly it all becomes so much easier.

So I'll first Tell y'all how Steaming Milk works

First of all you have two things to do here, aerating the milk and stirring the milk

Aerating milk is basically bubbling it to Aerate the milk all you have to do is just move the pitcher Slightly upwards enough to not see the End of the wand then just let the Horizontal bar (The sleeping one)go and get to the green after that is

Stirring the Milk

This one is much easier, it's basically just Mixing the milk up while it heats you just have to put the Pitcher as high as it can go and wait for the Vertical bar to reach green and don't worry about the Horizontal bar it freezes at its place as soon as you start Stirring the milk so just look at the Vertical bar and make sure it reaches green after both bars are at greens pull the pitcher down this will end the steaming process

 TL;DR

Don’t spend diamonds early. Save them for the Java Machine + Grinder first — diamonds are hard to get and these machines make the most money.

Always play with internet ON. Ads are optional, but watching them is the only consistent way to earn diamonds.

Don’t waste coffee tokens on the Normal Machine or Luxe 360. Save all tokens for both Java machines — best F2P choice.

After every day, check your machines. They break every 4–5 in-game days and broken machines reduce profit.

Buy upgrades early. Recommended order:

1.Mascot (more customers, cheap salary)

2.Patient Customers (more tips, very important)

3.Longer Days (more time = More customers = more money)

4.Measuring Cup (optional but good for precision)

Don’t multitask as a beginner. Learn skills one by one first (espresso, grinding, milk steaming).

Start multitasking only after mastering basics, and do it slowly.

Never steam milk while brewing espresso — you’ll overbrew espresso and burn milk.

Milk steaming = two steps:

Aerate milk (horizontal bar to green)

Stir milk (vertical bar to green)

Once both are green, stop steaming.",5,1768539921.0,GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee,8,0.86,False

Context - 36F, British, well travelled, second time in DR, generous tipper, not a fussy eater but like good quality.

3 star at best

Google reviews are a scam - staff badger you to leave them and in some cases take your phone and write them themselves.

It’s the basics that absolutely drove me round the twist

\* food cold, constantly

\* food undercooked, or burnt

\* drinks arrived at dessert if lucky

\* service in general PAINFULLY SLOW

\* generous tipping made zero difference

\* staff couldn’t give a shit, no smiles, no urgency in them whatsoever

\* ran out of plates and glasses at buffet then they just shrug at you when you ask for more?

\* never enough cutlery on tables, no salt and pepper, no condiments, struggle to get coffee with breakfast and showed to a dirty table every morning

\* Toilet broke everyday for 4 days, maintenance sometimes came, but didn’t fix it

\* mini bar not refilled daily like advertised so we had no drinking water

\* mostly clean but buffet floors vile and bedrooms needed a deep clean

\* wifi dips out and not strong enough to work

\* “level” wasn’t offered to us on check in, so we had no idea there was areas we weren’t allowed in, until we were literally told to get out - so rudely - by beach staff. Upon reflection, zero info was offered at check in except a map. We booked a premium palm room and thought this was an upgrade but there’s Level and Wellness. So there’s no pool service and it’s shit plastic beach beds for you. No cushions like shown in the pics and no Bali beds without paying an extra $1000 USD per week. Bali beds were $40 a day and vast majority sat empty all week.

\* QR menus out of date. Got fed up of asking for things that don’t exist

\* à la carte restaurants beyond slow. Took 70 minutes for a starter and main. We ditched it and went to buffet to actually eat, which many tables also did.

\* final piss take was them saying no availability for late check out, which is totally understandable, so they offered us the hospitality room to shower … but it had only cold water. Thanks Melia, you fucking shitshow

The slowness at this place is enough to put anyone into a coma. It far dragged down any positives.

Now I'm trying to get a small rental in the city so I can use my bike and earn money with my pet. I plan to start by delivering with apps, but I'm also looking to get a permit to sell coffee or breakfast from the bike. Of course, since I'll always have her with me, I don't see it as easy to build a specialized enclosure just for a coffee stand.

I don't have any money; I'm just building with whatever materials I can find where I am now (my dad's bus stop, very dusty, unfenced, and with a non-negotiable anti-pet-friendly policy, especially for me).

I used an old jerrycan to make fenders, something annoying that this bike was missing. I even made something to stop the chain from ruining my pants. Incredibly, a single jerrycan served all my purposes.

• It has a solar light that I repaired by bypassing it with a homemade switch.

• I built a base out of thick plywood. Too heavy in my opinion, but it was given to me by the nearby hardware store. Excellent gift.

• I made a Metalcom frame for the drawer, and I'm using cellular polycarbonate for the countertop and sides (I'm still making them). It's the lightest thing I could think of. I added USB string lights to the countertop inside the polycarbonate slots.

• I might make a Metalcom frame the same width as the bike for rear storage above the rack, because my pet will ride in front, and if I make something decent, I'll have good space to carry things in the back, plus a case for delivering food with apps. Hypothetically.

Yes, it's much heavier than I would have liked, and I usually carry a lot of extra weight. But it doesn't bother me too much knowing there aren't any hills and endless slopes like in the countryside, because in the city everything is level with bike lanes and everything.

For now, my dog ​​sleeps on the bike and I try to keep her warm. Being stubborn, I sleep next to the bike to keep her company because we can't have any peace apart.

Can you help me make this build not look so bad or ugly?

I also want to put some kind of main stand on it so the bike doesn't fall over, and so I don't have to lift it to do that. Maybe two metal clamps on each side would be a good idea, but I can't quite figure out how to improvise one. By the way, I have a cutting plotter here and I can create some vinyl decals.

1qe6via,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1qe6via/can_i_smoke_weed_again_personal_advice_request/,Can I smoke weed again? Personal advice request please,"Hello, I need advice. Lengthy post warning, but please, I need help. Please listen to my story, but detail is necessary here although I'll attempt to keep it as brief as I can.

First though, the main questions I’d like to be considered after having read this. 1. Does what I experiences sound like an anxiety induced panic attack followed by a period of depression and DPDR all triggered by personal life circumstances catalysed by weed usage, or was it a psychotic episode followed by DPDR, or something else entirely? 2. Can I ever smoke weed again as long as I’m taking care of myself, doing so in moderation with care and discipline?

I started with weed primarily by vaping flower while playing video games. I loved it. I loved it so much so that I ended up getting to a point where I'd consume (mainly smoking, some edibles) at the most an ounce through the week.

For years I've had awful self-care. I mean terrible undereating, awful sleep habits like countless all-nighters, little to no hydration, no semblance of a sleep schedule, etc. I essentially abused myself for years on end. Anwyays, I sort of had a 'stoner-phase'. I loved smoking weed.

Unfortunately last year I had some issues. I had stopped smoking weed for a couple of weeks, and I came back to my parents place. My girlfriend at the time was breaking up with me via a call, and I snapped. I recall getting physically hot to the point of having to strip, and scratching at my arms until the skin underneath bled. I've normally never been an anxious person, although I've had 'slumps' as I call them that could be alikened to episodes of depression.

Anyways, after that little episode I remember being semi-okay. Then my mum discussed debt with me, and I remember getting loud about 'how can they sell my debt to debt-collectors, debt is literally not having shit how can they sell not having shit'. I thought after those two little breakdowns I was okay. Until, I wasn't. I was sat doing a university assignment and I could feel my thoughts spiralling. I could feel the ruminating worsening. They were getting faster, and darker. I wanted to get out of my head, so when I went to a different city I thought 'oh yeah let's smoke some'. So over three days I smoked. On the third day, I suffered.

It didn’t help that I was giving my cat away at the same time. Nor did it help that I was doing a postgrad degree. It definitely didn’t help the girl I loved breaking up with me. And for a wonderful cherry on top I was thousands in debt with threats from debt collectors. Plus throughout all that I was eating like a shithead, not drinking enough water, and having not even a semblance of a sleeping schedule.

Back to the episode while high, I have to say I had what I'm not sure what the fuck it was. Either a panic attack, or a psychotic episode. From my understanding an episode of psychosis involves not understanding something is wrong, like you're fully lost in it. My legs were bouncing rapidly (they often do while sat, but this was shaking and different). I remember saying some bollocks about how I don't know how I feel but also that I feel anxious and sad and happy and everything all at once and yet nothing at all. So I think it was a panic attack, but I don't know.

I'm no stranger to being a little paranoid while high. Typical shit like 'did that person call my name' when you mishear something in a supermarket, 'does that person know I'm high', 'am I being followed'. I've sometimes been a little paranoid in general, but never an anxious individual. But this 'episode' while high was wholly different. I remember mumbling to my girlfriend such things like 'are you the figure of death here to take me away', ‘I’m just a slave to time’, and 'I'm worried my mum's poisoning my coffee'. I think looking back I was terrified I was going to die and I knew something was wrong so I was worrying about things like coffee. That's what makes me inclined to believe it was a panic attack, that I knew it wasn't right and that I knew it was unlikely, but I think I was worried because I knew something was wrong and I couldn't figure it out. She put me to sleep, but the days and weeks that followed were like a corpse living. 

I had one other time when I first smoked where the flashing light in the shower made me feel like I was having a seizure. Everything looked like TV snow, and I remember frantically googling shit about laced weed before falling asleep to get rid of it. Another time I had what I dubbed a 'mini religious psychosis' one time while high when I got a vivid visual in my head of 'hell', this bridge through fire with blackened silhouttes walking across. But I also had a wonderful moment in a park at night watching the stars and I remember thinking the shape looked like Apu from the Simpsons, thinking if God were real he's here in the stars and here in all of us, and man the stars looked beautiful. I've had many, many, many wondeful moments while high.

After I returned from the city I last consumed weed in, everything went downhill. I looked like a corpse, and I felt like one. I was incredibly skinny and I looked like a damn zombie. I look at photos of that time and it’s like there’s no soul in my eyes. I could’ve sworn I was smiling, that’s what my facial muscles felt like they were doing at the time, but I look completely straight-faced. For the first few days I was floor-bound. I couldn't get up. I'd crawl to my mother's lap and rest my head. That's about all I could do. I was talking about infinity and its implications. I was fully in the existential angst and dread of it all, and it's like my soul didn't even have the energy to think let alone walk and eat and stuff.

During my time back home my parents took great care of me. They rebuilt my food habits up. For the first few weeks I had insomnia, and fuck I wouldn't wish that upon anyone. 20 minutes a night maybe, if that. My mum was reading me childhood stories, I'd drink warm milk, have a nightlight on, lay with her. Anything and everything besides pills was tried. I became deeply mistrusting. I don't think it helped the trust that when I was down in the other city I saw a message from my girlfriend to someone else saying she despised me. She threw that word around with family members of hers and stuff, so I don't necessarily think it was true. She claimed she was just sad our cat was being re-homed, and mad I brought that sadness into her life. I realise looking back, after having spoken to her about it since we’re still close and she’s read the majority of this post prior to edits, she was angry with me about something I’d done to wrong her, and ya know what I don’t blame her.

The insomnia finally went away, but I wasn't me. It's like the 'me' was in a box, and I was watching him. Not in the literal visual sense. I'd read things related to my field and it was like 'I know I should understand this, but I can't'. My cognitive abilities went to shit. Weed fucked with my memory, but this 'fog' was different. And speaking of fog, the worst part was the faces of those I love becoming blurry and foggy. They looked hazy or their features smeared, like they weren't there. I had this once, before my 'stoner phase', when I was stressed about my undergrad dissertation and chaining together ADHD meds to stay awake. I also had the suicidal idealisation then.

But this time the thoughts of suicide were like very five minutes. I had vivid imagery of a razor blade slitting my jugular, an axe to my mother's head, a noose around my neck. All these horrible, gross, intrusive thougts. It’s like my mind was only feeding me words and images that I normally would find hurtful, uncomfortable, and sad. Yet I basically felt nothing, nor could I identify my feelings. It was this total abyss of anhedonia and apathy. I'd do things and be like 'past me wouldn't say this, or do this, why am I?'. A small example being I ate steak when normally I wouldn’t because I really don’t like it. I almost threw up. Speaking of vomit I would throw up once each two days in a row every now and again weirdly. Anyway, why did I eat it? Because it felt like I was committing a huge sin if I didn’t. The time the I individual spent preparing it, life of the animal being sacrificed, and so on.

That’s what it felt like in general. Like the weight of the entire cosmos was on my shoulders, all of my previous sins and all of those of everyone in the world. It felt like everything I did was wrong, and that I couldn’t understand anything. I remember walking around mumbling about how I didn’t understand anything and I don’t believe in anything and nothing makes any sense. Beyond that, it felt like I had to relearn being an adult, almost like a child re-growing up. The entire world around me, the entire fabric of my reality, had to be rebuilt bit by bit. And that was done through question anything and everything, with such racing thoughts that it felt like it was driving me crazy.

It was almost like I didn’t trust my eyes, my ears, or any of my other senses. My thoughts were racing so fast it almost sounded like someone was yelling at me. I’d taken shrooms once or twice prior to little effect but I was worrying that I was going to start hallucinating and develop schizophrenia or something as a result of having tried things like that in the past. Voices of other people conversing became so loud when I’d eat at the dinner table I’d physically cower away from it. And I’d notice at random times my vision would just get blurrier. I mean I need glasses for long distance anyways, but this was different.

I was constantly questioning everything like why is that blade of grass growing the way it is, or why is that pebble there, who painted that sign and spiralling thinking about all the individuals and crude oil and machines etc involved in the process. I was also having deep religious and philosophical thoughts. Constantly querying where this was all a simulation or not, etc, trying to solve the bigger questions in life that I know I can never have answers for. I’d walk around outside on daily walks and I’d be so worried about stepping on a snail or something and going to hell for a result of the murder. In many ways it was like the scope of which I perceived reality was shifting dramatically, looking at things from a far wider lens than I could comprehend. I felt so small, so insignificant, and myself and everything felt meaningless. 

I knew there was something wrong, but I just didn't feel like me. I guess it could be described as an episode of major depressive disorder with an episode of DPDR? I remember saying I'll never get over it, it will never go away.

However, I'm now through it. I think eating better and getting sleep and the support of my family and so many other things contributed to my recovery. In some ways, if I'm looking at it spiritually I'd say life was like 'hey, you're fucking it up and straying from your path, you don't get control for a bit'. At the time I became deeply philosophical in an unhealthy way, always worrying about a 'simulation' or a 'matrix' so-to-speak. But from a different perspective I sometimes view it like my mind just went into a sort of 'recalibration' mode. Like being high all the time was this heightened state of being and once it stopped my mind just sort of went 'fuck all these bad habits, AND the weed on top? really?? we need to repair, fuck off world.'. It's like I spent years burning the candle at both ends, or driving a car with no petrol in, and finally the 'borrowed energy from tomorrow' had to be repaired.

Now? I'm through it. The disconnect feeling is gone. Faces are beautiful and non-blurry again. I remember one time I panicked thinking I saw a spider on the couch that wasn't really there. Nothing like that has happened since. I realise now my worries about developing schizophrenia or psychosis were ungrounded since if I were developing them not only would I still be suffering the symptoms, I wouldn't be worrying about them as I wouldn't realise something was wrong.

I feel good again, and I'm trying to build better habits. It's important to note that I was diagnosed with various deficiencies, notably vitamin D and B (12 and 6 I believe), before I really hit my 'stoner phase' and I continued to eat like a moron. What I really want to ask is, can I ever smoke weed again? If it were dietary and the accumulation of bad habits, combined with weed, then maybe in moderation and with discipline it's possible? It’s like during the ruminating while I was working on that assignment I knew the dam that is my mind was cracking, instead of working to repair it, I smoked weed and that was like taking a sledgehammer to the dam and decimating it. 

To put it in another way, I feel like life is like a river and I am but a leaf in the stream. Except in those months, my leaf became stranded atop a rock and I was watching the stream float by. I had countless financial and interpersonal issues, as well as academic, combined with awful personal habits. Now I'm recovered touch wood. To put it another way, I see it like Jenga. Unhealthy habits and behaviours are like removing blocks. Healthy habits are like replacing the blocks. Then, weed is like shaking the table. It's possible to continue playing while the table shakes, but you have to be more careful with mitigating unhealthy habits and even more dilligent with exhibiting positive and healthy habits and behaviours.

All in all from initial panic attack like things to feeling okay it took maybe around 5 months? After the first 3 though I was feeling I don’t know maybe 70% better, and for the last month of it I was like 95% better 95% of the time. Now? Well it’s been just shy of 9 months since the start and I feel 99.99% better 99.99% of the time. Frankly? I feel great. I’ve experienced some wonderful things, like attending the graduation of the girl I spoke about prior. I finished my dissertation. Money isn’t there yet but I’m getting interviews and assessment centres for grad schemes. Hell, I literally climbed a freaking mountain!

All that said, the advice I want is 1. trying to define and understand what the fuck that was, and 2. regarding the possibility of ever enjoying weed again. If it was primarily dietary and anxiety, then weed may be viable in my future, or so I'd like to hope. If I were to enjoy consuming again, then I have the following strict rules:

•	⁠Only after a certain age (of which I will not share due to privacy, but an age that is noted for brain development slowing and maturing). That age is in about 1.5 years from now, although frankly I don’t really want to wait that long if I’m being honest.

•	⁠Low dosages of higher CBD lower THC (something equal ratio like Atlas F1) with no hash or anything mixed. I.e. only smoking until I'm sufficiently high not finishing my joint just for the sake of it. Some may recommend Indica dominant but Sativa always has the effects I was looking for. Certain strains like cherry strains made me more paranoid or anxious feeling. So I have a general idea of what to look for and what to avoid. 

•	⁠Only once a week, max, and building up to it. None of this before work, on break, and after work bullshit. And only after a productive week and especially a productive day. Like I'd like to smoke on a Saturday night after a day of reading literature, playing piano, studying my two languages I'm learning, and practicing a new skill/hobby.

•	⁠Something homegrown to remove the risk of sprayed chemicals. Definitely no budget weed from a 'cafe' that was a semi-sketchy underground place I used to frequent. Possibly something like a coffeeshop in Amsterdam, something trusted and reliable.

•	⁠Having my best friend of many years (who is more like a brother) with me the first time, and checking in with him after every time.

•	⁠Analysing my mood and situation in life. If my mood is wrong or I'm having any financial, interpersonal, or other issues contributing to stressors or anxiety, then smoking is a no-go. I learnt that lesson from alcohol, i.e. whatever mood I was in, alcohol exacerbated it. I never thought I’d be able to have a drink or a cigarette since the start of this little nightmare as I was worried it would trigger it again or cause me to develop psychosis or something, but I’ve been able to enjoy a couple of reasonably sensible drinks in moderation.

•	⁠Only smoking for the first time in all this time if I've exhibited discipline in all my endeavours first. I.e. continuing my language and piano studios for neurological benefits, having better eating/hydration/sleep habits, etc.

•	⁠Also only smoking for the first time in all this time if I haven't dwelled on those months of hell and torture for a little while, at least a month or preferably 3 or even 6.

I'm sure there are more rules I have in mind, but those are the main ones.

I miss the connection I felt to the world and 'god'; I miss the stars that one night; I miss the brightness of the sun on those days; I miss the adventures; I miss the creativity. It's silly, but I miss the fun and I can't picture a future without it. But, I also can never tolerate those months again, I will die if I do.

1qe6uu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/derealization/comments/1qe6uu5/can_i_smoke_weed_again_personal_advice_request/,Can I smoke weed again? Personal advice request please,"Hello, I need advice. Lengthy post warning, but please, I need help. Please listen to my story, but detail is necessary here although I'll attempt to keep it as brief as I can.

First though, the main questions I’d like to be considered after having read this. 1. Does what I experiences sound like an anxiety induced panic attack followed by a period of depression and DPDR all triggered by personal life circumstances catalysed by weed usage, or was it a psychotic episode followed by DPDR, or something else entirely? 2. Can I ever smoke weed again as long as I’m taking care of myself, doing so in moderation with care and discipline?

I started with weed primarily by vaping flower while playing video games. I loved it. I loved it so much so that I ended up getting to a point where I'd consume (mainly smoking, some edibles) at the most an ounce through the week.

For years I've had awful self-care. I mean terrible undereating, awful sleep habits like countless all-nighters, little to no hydration, no semblance of a sleep schedule, etc. I essentially abused myself for years on end. Anwyays, I sort of had a 'stoner-phase'. I loved smoking weed.

Unfortunately last year I had some issues. I had stopped smoking weed for a couple of weeks, and I came back to my parents place. My girlfriend at the time was breaking up with me via a call, and I snapped. I recall getting physically hot to the point of having to strip, and scratching at my arms until the skin underneath bled. I've normally never been an anxious person, although I've had 'slumps' as I call them that could be alikened to episodes of depression.

Anyways, after that little episode I remember being semi-okay. Then my mum discussed debt with me, and I remember getting loud about 'how can they sell my debt to debt-collectors, debt is literally not having shit how can they sell not having shit'. I thought after those two little breakdowns I was okay. Until, I wasn't. I was sat doing a university assignment and I could feel my thoughts spiralling. I could feel the ruminating worsening. They were getting faster, and darker. I wanted to get out of my head, so when I went to a different city I thought 'oh yeah let's smoke some'. So over three days I smoked. On the third day, I suffered.

It didn’t help that I was giving my cat away at the same time. Nor did it help that I was doing a postgrad degree. It definitely didn’t help the girl I loved breaking up with me. And for a wonderful cherry on top I was thousands in debt with threats from debt collectors. Plus throughout all that I was eating like a shithead, not drinking enough water, and having not even a semblance of a sleeping schedule.

Back to the episode while high, I have to say I had what I'm not sure what the fuck it was. Either a panic attack, or a psychotic episode. From my understanding an episode of psychosis involves not understanding something is wrong, like you're fully lost in it. My legs were bouncing rapidly (they often do while sat, but this was shaking and different). I remember saying some bollocks about how I don't know how I feel but also that I feel anxious and sad and happy and everything all at once and yet nothing at all. So I think it was a panic attack, but I don't know.

I'm no stranger to being a little paranoid while high. Typical shit like 'did that person call my name' when you mishear something in a supermarket, 'does that person know I'm high', 'am I being followed'. I've sometimes been a little paranoid in general, but never an anxious individual. But this 'episode' while high was wholly different. I remember mumbling to my girlfriend such things like 'are you the figure of death here to take me away', ‘I’m just a slave to time’, and 'I'm worried my mum's poisoning my coffee'. I think looking back I was terrified I was going to die and I knew something was wrong so I was worrying about things like coffee. That's what makes me inclined to believe it was a panic attack, that I knew it wasn't right and that I knew it was unlikely, but I think I was worried because I knew something was wrong and I couldn't figure it out. She put me to sleep, but the days and weeks that followed were like a corpse living. 

I had one other time when I first smoked where the flashing light in the shower made me feel like I was having a seizure. Everything looked like TV snow, and I remember frantically googling shit about laced weed before falling asleep to get rid of it. Another time I had what I dubbed a 'mini religious psychosis' one time while high when I got a vivid visual in my head of 'hell', this bridge through fire with blackened silhouttes walking across. But I also had a wonderful moment in a park at night watching the stars and I remember thinking the shape looked like Apu from the Simpsons, thinking if God were real he's here in the stars and here in all of us, and man the stars looked beautiful. I've had many, many, many wondeful moments while high.

After I returned from the city I last consumed weed in, everything went downhill. I looked like a corpse, and I felt like one. I was incredibly skinny and I looked like a damn zombie. I look at photos of that time and it’s like there’s no soul in my eyes. I could’ve sworn I was smiling, that’s what my facial muscles felt like they were doing at the time, but I look completely straight-faced. For the first few days I was floor-bound. I couldn't get up. I'd crawl to my mother's lap and rest my head. That's about all I could do. I was talking about infinity and its implications. I was fully in the existential angst and dread of it all, and it's like my soul didn't even have the energy to think let alone walk and eat and stuff.

During my time back home my parents took great care of me. They rebuilt my food habits up. For the first few weeks I had insomnia, and fuck I wouldn't wish that upon anyone. 20 minutes a night maybe, if that. My mum was reading me childhood stories, I'd drink warm milk, have a nightlight on, lay with her. Anything and everything besides pills was tried. I became deeply mistrusting. I don't think it helped the trust that when I was down in the other city I saw a message from my girlfriend to someone else saying she despised me. She threw that word around with family members of hers and stuff, so I don't necessarily think it was true. She claimed she was just sad our cat was being re-homed, and mad I brought that sadness into her life. I realise looking back, after having spoken to her about it since we’re still close and she’s read the majority of this post prior to edits, she was angry with me about something I’d done to wrong her, and ya know what I don’t blame her.

The insomnia finally went away, but I wasn't me. It's like the 'me' was in a box, and I was watching him. Not in the literal visual sense. I'd read things related to my field and it was like 'I know I should understand this, but I can't'. My cognitive abilities went to shit. Weed fucked with my memory, but this 'fog' was different. And speaking of fog, the worst part was the faces of those I love becoming blurry and foggy. They looked hazy or their features smeared, like they weren't there. I had this once, before my 'stoner phase', when I was stressed about my undergrad dissertation and chaining together ADHD meds to stay awake. I also had the suicidal idealisation then.

But this time the thoughts of suicide were like very five minutes. I had vivid imagery of a razor blade slitting my jugular, an axe to my mother's head, a noose around my neck. All these horrible, gross, intrusive thougts. It’s like my mind was only feeding me words and images that I normally would find hurtful, uncomfortable, and sad. Yet I basically felt nothing, nor could I identify my feelings. It was this total abyss of anhedonia and apathy. I'd do things and be like 'past me wouldn't say this, or do this, why am I?'. A small example being I ate steak when normally I wouldn’t because I really don’t like it. I almost threw up. Speaking of vomit I would throw up once each two days in a row every now and again weirdly. Anyway, why did I eat it? Because it felt like I was committing a huge sin if I didn’t. The time the I individual spent preparing it, life of the animal being sacrificed, and so on.

That’s what it felt like in general. Like the weight of the entire cosmos was on my shoulders, all of my previous sins and all of those of everyone in the world. It felt like everything I did was wrong, and that I couldn’t understand anything. I remember walking around mumbling about how I didn’t understand anything and I don’t believe in anything and nothing makes any sense. Beyond that, it felt like I had to relearn being an adult, almost like a child re-growing up. The entire world around me, the entire fabric of my reality, had to be rebuilt bit by bit. And that was done through question anything and everything, with such racing thoughts that it felt like it was driving me crazy.

It was almost like I didn’t trust my eyes, my ears, or any of my other senses. My thoughts were racing so fast it almost sounded like someone was yelling at me. I’d taken shrooms once or twice prior to little effect but I was worrying that I was going to start hallucinating and develop schizophrenia or something as a result of having tried things like that in the past. Voices of other people conversing became so loud when I’d eat at the dinner table I’d physically cower away from it. And I’d notice at random times my vision would just get blurrier. I mean I need glasses for long distance anyways, but this was different.

I was constantly questioning everything like why is that blade of grass growing the way it is, or why is that pebble there, who painted that sign and spiralling thinking about all the individuals and crude oil and machines etc involved in the process. I was also having deep religious and philosophical thoughts. Constantly querying where this was all a simulation or not, etc, trying to solve the bigger questions in life that I know I can never have answers for. I’d walk around outside on daily walks and I’d be so worried about stepping on a snail or something and going to hell for a result of the murder. In many ways it was like the scope of which I perceived reality was shifting dramatically, looking at things from a far wider lens than I could comprehend. I felt so small, so insignificant, and myself and everything felt meaningless. 

I knew there was something wrong, but I just didn't feel like me. I guess it could be described as an episode of major depressive disorder with an episode of DPDR? I remember saying I'll never get over it, it will never go away.

However, I'm now through it. I think eating better and getting sleep and the support of my family and so many other things contributed to my recovery.

But from a different perspective I sometimes view it like my mind just went into a sort of 'recalibration' mode.

It's like I spent years burning the candle at both ends, or driving a car with no petrol in, and finally the 'borrowed energy from tomorrow' had to be repaired.

It felt like everything I did was wrong, and that I couldn’t understand anything. I remember walking around mumbling about how I didn’t understand anything and I don’t believe in anything and nothing makes any sense. Beyond that, it felt like I had to relearn being an adult, almost like a child re-growing up. The entire world around me, the entire fabric of my reality, had to be rebuilt bit by bit. And that was done through question anything and everything, with such racing thoughts that it felt like it was driving me crazy.

It was almost like I didn’t trust my eyes, my ears, or any of my other senses. My thoughts were racing so fast it almost sounded like someone was yelling at me. I’d taken shrooms once or twice prior to little effect but I was worrying that I was going to start hallucinating and develop schizophrenia or something as a result of having tried things like that in the past. Voices of other people conversing became so loud when I’d eat at the dinner table I’d physically cower away from it. And I’d notice at random times my vision would just get blurrier. I mean I need glasses for long distance anyways, but this was different.

I was constantly questioning everything like why is that blade of grass growing the way it is, or why is that pebble there, who painted that sign and spiralling thinking about all the individuals and crude oil and machines etc involved in the process. I was also having deep religious and philosophical thoughts. Constantly querying where this was all a simulation or not, etc, trying to solve the bigger questions in life that I know I can never have answers for. I’d walk around outside on daily walks and I’d be so worried about stepping on a snail or something and going to hell for a result of the murder. In many ways it was like the scope of which I perceived reality was shifting dramatically, looking at things from a far wider lens than I could comprehend. I felt so small, so insignificant, and myself and everything felt meaningless. 

I knew there was something wrong, but I just didn't feel like me. I guess it could be described as an episode of major depressive disorder with an episode of DPDR? I remember saying I'll never get over it, it will never go away.

However, I'm now through it. I think eating better and getting sleep and the support of my family and so many other things contributed to my recovery. In some ways, if I'm looking at it spiritually I'd say life was like 'hey, you're fucking it up and straying from your path, you don't get control for a bit'. At the time I became deeply philosophical in an unhealthy way, always worrying about a 'simulation' or a 'matrix' so-to-speak. But from a different perspective I sometimes view it like my mind just went into a sort of 'recalibration' mode. Like being high all the time was this heightened state of being and once it stopped my mind just sort of went 'fuck all these bad habits, AND the weed on top? really?? we need to repair, fuck off world.'. It's like I spent years burning the candle at both ends, or driving a car with no petrol in, and finally the 'borrowed energy from tomorrow' had to be repaired.

Now? I'm through it. The disconnect feeling is gone. Faces are beautiful and non-blurry again. I remember one time I panicked thinking I saw a spider on the couch that wasn't really there. Nothing like that has happened since. I realise now my worries about developing schizophrenia or psychosis were ungrounded since if I were developing them not only would I still be suffering the symptoms, I wouldn't be worrying about them as I wouldn't realise something was wrong.

I feel good again, and I'm trying to build better habits. It's important to note that I was diagnosed with various deficiencies, notably vitamin D and B (12 and 6 I believe), before I really hit my 'stoner phase' and I continued to eat like a moron. What I really want to ask is, can I ever smoke weed again? If it were dietary and the accumulation of bad habits, combined with weed, then maybe in moderation and with discipline it's possible? It’s like during the ruminating while I was working on that assignment I knew the dam that is my mind was cracking, instead of working to repair it, I smoked weed and that was like taking a sledgehammer to the dam and decimating it. 

To put it in another way, I feel like life is like a river and I am but a leaf in the stream. Except in those months, my leaf became stranded atop a rock and I was watching the stream float by. I had countless financial and interpersonal issues, as well as academic, combined with awful personal habits. Now I'm recovered touch wood. To put it another way, I see it like Jenga. Unhealthy habits and behaviours are like removing blocks. Healthy habits are like replacing the blocks. Then, weed is like shaking the table. It's possible to continue playing while the table shakes, but you have to be more careful with mitigating unhealthy habits and even more dilligent with exhibiting positive and healthy habits and behaviours.

All in all from initial panic attack like things to feeling okay it took maybe around 5 months? After the first 3 though I was feeling I don’t know maybe 70% better, and for the last month of it I was like 95% better 95% of the time. Now? Well it’s been just shy of 9 months since the start and I feel 99.99% better 99.99% of the time. Frankly? I feel great. I’ve experienced some wonderful things, like attending the graduation of the girl I spoke about prior. I finished my dissertation. Money isn’t there yet but I’m getting interviews and assessment centres for grad schemes. Hell, I literally climbed a freaking mountain!

All that said, the advice I want is 1. trying to define and understand what the fuck that was, and 2. regarding the possibility of ever enjoying weed again. If it was primarily dietary and anxiety, then weed may be viable in my future, or so I'd like to hope. If I were to enjoy consuming again, then I have the following strict rules:

•	⁠Only after a certain age (of which I will not share due to privacy, but an age that is noted for brain development slowing and maturing). That age is in about 1.5 years from now, although frankly I don’t really want to wait that long if I’m being honest.

•	⁠Low dosages of higher CBD lower THC (something equal ratio like Atlas F1) with no hash or anything mixed. I.e. only smoking until I'm sufficiently high not finishing my joint just for the sake of it. Some may recommend Indica dominant but Sativa always has the effects I was looking for. Certain strains like cherry strains made me more paranoid or anxious feeling. So I have a general idea of what to look for and what to avoid. 

•	⁠Only once a week, max, and building up to it. None of this before work, on break, and after work bullshit. And only after a productive week and especially a productive day. Like I'd like to smoke on a Saturday night after a day of reading literature, playing piano, studying my two languages I'm learning, and practicing a new skill/hobby.

•	⁠Something homegrown to remove the risk of sprayed chemicals. Definitely no budget weed from a 'cafe' that was a semi-sketchy underground place I used to frequent. Possibly something like a coffeeshop in Amsterdam, something trusted and reliable.

•	⁠Having my best friend of many years (who is more like a brother) with me the first time, and checking in with him after every time.

•	⁠Analysing my mood and situation in life. If my mood is wrong or I'm having any financial, interpersonal, or other issues contributing to stressors or anxiety, then smoking is a no-go. I learnt that lesson from alcohol, i.e. whatever mood I was in, alcohol exacerbated it. I never thought I’d be able to have a drink or a cigarette since the start of this little nightmare as I was worried it would trigger it again or cause me to develop psychosis or something, but I’ve been able to enjoy a couple of reasonably sensible drinks in moderation.

•	⁠Only smoking for the first time in all this time if I've exhibited discipline in all my endeavours first. I.e. continuing my language and piano studios for neurological benefits, having better eating/hydration/sleep habits, etc.

•	⁠Also only smoking for the first time in all this time if I haven't dwelled on those months of hell and torture for a little while, at least a month or preferably 3 or even 6.

I'm sure there are more rules I have in mind, but those are the main ones.

I miss the connection I felt to the world and 'god'; I miss the stars that one night; I miss the brightness of the sun on those days; I miss the adventures; I miss the creativity. It's silly, but I miss the fun and I can't picture a future without it. But, I also can never tolerate those months again, I will die if I do.

1qe6tpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1qe6tpf/can_i_smoke_weed_again_personal_advice_request/,Can I smoke weed again? Personal advice request please,"Hello, I need advice. Lengthy post warning, but please, I need help. Please listen to my story, but detail is necessary here although I'll attempt to keep it as brief as I can.

First though, the main questions I’d like to be considered after having read this. 1. Does what I experiences sound like an anxiety induced panic attack followed by a period of depression and DPDR all triggered by personal life circumstances catalysed by weed usage, or was it a psychotic episode followed by DPDR, or something else entirely? 2. Can I ever smoke weed again as long as I’m taking care of myself, doing so in moderation with care and discipline?

I started with weed primarily by vaping flower while playing video games. I loved it. I loved it so much so that I ended up getting to a point where I'd consume (mainly smoking, some edibles) at the most an ounce through the week.

For years I've had awful self-care. I mean terrible undereating, awful sleep habits like countless all-nighters, little to no hydration, no semblance of a sleep schedule, etc. I essentially abused myself for years on end. Anwyays, I sort of had a 'stoner-phase'. I loved smoking weed.

Unfortunately last year I had some issues. I had stopped smoking weed for a couple of weeks, and I came back to my parents place. My girlfriend at the time was breaking up with me via a call, and I snapped. I recall getting physically hot to the point of having to strip, and scratching at my arms until the skin underneath bled. I've normally never been an anxious person, although I've had 'slumps' as I call them that could be alikened to episodes of depression.

Anyways, after that little episode I remember being semi-okay. Then my mum discussed debt with me, and I remember getting loud about 'how can they sell my debt to debt-collectors, debt is literally not having shit how can they sell not having shit'. I thought after those two little breakdowns I was okay. Until, I wasn't. I was sat doing a university assignment and I could feel my thoughts spiralling. I could feel the ruminating worsening. They were getting faster, and darker. I wanted to get out of my head, so when I went to a different city I thought 'oh yeah let's smoke some'. So over three days I smoked. On the third day, I suffered.

It didn’t help that I was giving my cat away at the same time. Nor did it help that I was doing a postgrad degree. It definitely didn’t help the girl I loved breaking up with me. And for a wonderful cherry on top I was thousands in debt with threats from debt collectors. Plus throughout all that I was eating like a shithead, not drinking enough water, and having not even a semblance of a sleeping schedule.

Back to the episode while high, I have to say I had what I'm not sure what the fuck it was. Either a panic attack, or a psychotic episode. From my understanding an episode of psychosis involves not understanding something is wrong, like you're fully lost in it. My legs were bouncing rapidly (they often do while sat, but this was shaking and different). I remember saying some bollocks about how I don't know how I feel but also that I feel anxious and sad and happy and everything all at once and yet nothing at all. So I think it was a panic attack, but I don't know.

I'm no stranger to being a little paranoid while high. Typical shit like 'did that person call my name' when you mishear something in a supermarket, 'does that person know I'm high', 'am I being followed'. I've sometimes been a little paranoid in general, but never an anxious individual. But this 'episode' while high was wholly different. I remember mumbling to my girlfriend such things like 'are you the figure of death here to take me away', ‘I’m just a slave to time’, and 'I'm worried my mum's poisoning my coffee'. I think looking back I was terrified I was going to die and I knew something was wrong so I was worrying about things like coffee. That's what makes me inclined to believe it was a panic attack, that I knew it wasn't right and that I knew it was unlikely, but I think I was worried because I knew something was wrong and I couldn't figure it out. She put me to sleep, but the days and weeks that followed were like a corpse living. 

I had one other time when I first smoked where the flashing light in the shower made me feel like I was having a seizure. Everything looked like TV snow, and I remember frantically googling shit about laced weed before falling asleep to get rid of it. Another time I had what I dubbed a 'mini religious psychosis' one time while high when I got a vivid visual in my head of 'hell', this bridge through fire with blackened silhouttes walking across. But I also had a wonderful moment in a park at night watching the stars and I remember thinking the shape looked like Apu from the Simpsons, thinking if God were real he's here in the stars and here in all of us, and man the stars looked beautiful. I've had many, many, many wondeful moments while high.

After I returned from the city I last consumed weed in, everything went downhill. I looked like a corpse, and I felt like one. I was incredibly skinny and I looked like a damn zombie. I look at photos of that time and it’s like there’s no soul in my eyes. I could’ve sworn I was smiling, that’s what my facial muscles felt like they were doing at the time, but I look completely straight-faced. For the first few days I was floor-bound. I couldn't get up. I'd crawl to my mother's lap and rest my head. That's about all I could do. I was talking about infinity and its implications. I was fully in the existential angst and dread of it all, and it's like my soul didn't even have the energy to think let alone walk and eat and stuff.

During my time back home my parents took great care of me. They rebuilt my food habits up. For the first few weeks I had insomnia, and fuck I wouldn't wish that upon anyone. 20 minutes a night maybe, if that. My mum was reading me childhood stories, I'd drink warm milk, have a nightlight on, lay with her. Anything and everything besides pills was tried. I became deeply mistrusting. I don't think it helped the trust that when I was down in the other city I saw a message from my girlfriend to someone else saying she despised me. She threw that word around with family members of hers and stuff, so I don't necessarily think it was true. She claimed she was just sad our cat was being re-homed, and mad I brought that sadness into her life. I realise looking back, after having spoken to her about it since we’re still close and she’s read the majority of this post prior to edits, she was angry with me about something I’d done to wrong her, and ya know what I don’t blame her.

The insomnia finally went away, but I wasn't me. It's like the 'me' was in a box, and I was watching him. Not in the literal visual sense. I'd read things related to my field and it was like 'I know I should understand this, but I can't'. My cognitive abilities went to shit. Weed fucked with my memory, but this 'fog' was different. And speaking of fog, the worst part was the faces of those I love becoming blurry and foggy. They looked hazy or their features smeared, like they weren't there. I had this once, before my 'stoner phase', when I was stressed about my undergrad dissertation and chaining together ADHD meds to stay awake. I also had the suicidal idealisation then.

But this time the thoughts of suicide were like very five minutes. I had vivid imagery of a razor blade slitting my jugular, an axe to my mother's head, a noose around my neck. All these horrible, gross, intrusive thougts. It’s like my mind was only feeding me words and images that I normally would find hurtful, uncomfortable, and sad. Yet I basically felt nothing, nor could I identify my feelings. It was this total abyss of anhedonia and apathy. I'd do things and be like 'past me wouldn't say this, or do this, why am I?'. A small example being I ate steak when normally I wouldn’t because I really don’t like it. I almost threw up. Speaking of vomit I would throw up once each two days in a row every now and again weirdly. Anyway, why did I eat it? Because it felt like I was committing a huge sin if I didn’t. The time the I individual spent preparing it, life of the animal being sacrificed, and so on.

That’s what it felt like in general. Like the weight of the entire cosmos was on my shoulders, all of my previous sins and all of those of everyone in the world. It felt like everything I did was wrong, and that I couldn’t understand anything. I remember walking around mumbling about how I didn’t understand anything and I don’t believe in anything and nothing makes any sense. Beyond that, it felt like I had to relearn being an adult, almost like a child re-growing up. The entire world around me, the entire fabric of my reality, had to be rebuilt bit by bit. And that was done through question anything and everything, with such racing thoughts that it felt like it was driving me crazy.

It was almost like I didn’t trust my eyes, my ears, or any of my other senses. My thoughts were racing so fast it almost sounded like someone was yelling at me. I’d taken shrooms once or twice prior to little effect but I was worrying that I was going to start hallucinating and develop schizophrenia or something as a result of having tried things like that in the past. Voices of other people conversing became so loud when I’d eat at the dinner table I’d physically cower away from it. And I’d notice at random times my vision would just get blurrier. I mean I need glasses for long distance anyways, but this was different.

I was constantly questioning everything like why is that blade of grass growing the way it is, or why is that pebble there, who painted that sign and spiralling thinking about all the individuals and crude oil and machines etc involved in the process. I was also having deep religious and philosophical thoughts. Constantly querying where this was all a simulation or not, etc, trying to solve the bigger questions in life that I know I can never have answers for. I’d walk around outside on daily walks and I’d be so worried about stepping on a snail or something and going to hell for a result of the murder. In many ways it was like the scope of which I perceived reality was shifting dramatically, looking at things from a far wider lens than I could comprehend. I felt so small, so insignificant, and myself and everything felt meaningless. 

I knew there was something wrong, but I just didn't feel like me. I guess it could be described as an episode of major depressive disorder with an episode of DPDR? I remember saying I'll never get over it, it will never go away.

Like being high all the time was this heightened state of being and once it stopped my mind just sort of went 'fuck all these bad habits, AND the weed on top? really?? we need to repair, fuck off world.'. It's like I spent years burning the candle at both ends, or driving a car with no petrol in, and finally the 'borrowed energy from tomorrow' had to be repaired.

Now? I'm through it. The disconnect feeling is gone. Faces are beautiful and non-blurry again. I remember one time I panicked thinking I saw a spider on the couch that wasn't really there.

I had countless financial and interpersonal issues, as well as academic, combined with awful personal habits. Now I'm recovered touch wood. To put it another way, I see it like Jenga.

1qe6to7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1qe6to7/highfunctioning_adult_with_adhd/,High-functioning adult with ADHD?,"Hello everyone,

I joined this community to see if anyone relates to struggling with ADHD as a high-functioning adult.

I’m 35, married, and co-own a growing business with my brother. I handle sales, marketing, and creative direction. I’m generally capable, creative, and well-read—but I’ve lived with what feel like ADHD symptoms most of my life: forgetfulness, poor attention for boring tasks, weak spatial skills, and a brain that only performs well when deeply interested.

I was tested as a child (8–9), though I never saw the report. For years I believed discipline and willpower were enough. They worked… until they didn’t. As responsibilities grew, my focus, memory, energy, and sleep slowly fell apart. Pushing harder stopped helping.

I recently went for a proper adult evaluation (Nesplora included), and I’m awaiting results. What pushed me to finally do it was something simple:

I spent 30 minutes searching for my keys.

They were in the trash.

I have no memory of throwing them away.

That moment scared me. I felt like I couldn’t trust my own brain anymore.

I’m now considering medication. I once tried Vyvanse, but it wrecked my sleep, so I quit. Still, I’m realizing I worry more about medication side effects than about the long-term cost of not treating this.

Right now I feel frustrated, discouraged, and angry at myself—but also hopeful.

I wanted to ask: am I alone in this? Have any of you experienced something similar as adults?

Thanks for reading. I’m off to drink coffee with my cats and try to calm my brain.

Peace and love 🌎

She put me to sleep, but the days and weeks that followed were like a corpse living. 

I had one other time when I first smoked where the flashing light in the shower made me feel like I was having a seizure. Everything looked like TV snow, and I remember frantically googling shit about laced weed before falling asleep to get rid of it. Another time I had what I dubbed a 'mini religious psychosis' one time while high when I got a vivid visual in my head of 'hell', this bridge through fire with blackened silhouttes walking across. But I also had a wonderful moment in a park at night watching the stars and I remember thinking the shape looked like Apu from the Simpsons, thinking if God were real he's here in the stars and here in all of us, and man the stars looked beautiful. I've had many, many, many wondeful moments while high.

After I returned from the city I last consumed weed in, everything went downhill. I looked like a corpse, and I felt like one. I was incredibly skinny and I looked like a damn zombie. I look at photos of that time and it’s like there’s no soul in my eyes. I could’ve sworn I was smiling, that’s what my facial muscles felt like they were doing at the time, but I look completely straight-faced. For the first few days I was floor-bound. I couldn't get up. I'd crawl to my mother's lap and rest my head. That's about all I could do. I was talking about infinity and its implications. I was fully in the existential angst and dread of it all, and it's like my soul didn't even have the energy to think let alone walk and eat and stuff.

During my time back home my parents took great care of me. They rebuilt my food habits up. For the first few weeks I had insomnia, and fuck I wouldn't wish that upon anyone. 20 minutes a night maybe, if that. My mum was reading me childhood stories, I'd drink warm milk, have a nightlight on, lay with her. Anything and everything besides pills was tried. I became deeply mistrusting. I don't think it helped the trust that when I was down in the other city I saw a message from my girlfriend to someone else saying she despised me. She threw that word around with family members of hers and stuff, so I don't necessarily think it was true. She claimed she was just sad our cat was being re-homed, and mad I brought that sadness into her life. I realise looking back, after having spoken to her about it since we’re still close and she’s read the majority of this post prior to edits, she was angry with me about something I’d done to wrong her, and ya know what I don’t blame her.

The insomnia finally went away, but I wasn't me. It's like the 'me' was in a box, and I was watching him. Not in the literal visual sense. I'd read things related to my field and it was like 'I know I should understand this, but I can't'. My cognitive abilities went to shit. Weed fucked with my memory, but this 'fog' was different. And speaking of fog, the worst part was the faces of those I love becoming blurry and foggy. They looked hazy or their features smeared, like they weren't there. I had this once, before my 'stoner phase', when I was stressed about my undergrad dissertation and chaining together ADHD meds to stay awake. I also had the suicidal idealisation then.

But this time the thoughts of suicide were like very five minutes. I had vivid imagery of a razor blade slitting my jugular, an axe to my mother's head, a noose around my neck. All these horrible, gross, intrusive thougts. It’s like my mind was only feeding me words and images that I normally would find hurtful, uncomfortable, and sad. Yet I basically felt nothing, nor could I identify my feelings. It was this total abyss of anhedonia and apathy. I'd do things and be like 'past me wouldn't say this, or do this, why am I?'. A small example being I ate steak when normally I wouldn’t because I really don’t like it. I almost threw up. Speaking of vomit I would throw up once each two days in a row every now and again weirdly. Anyway, why did I eat it? Because it felt like I was committing a huge sin if I didn’t. The time the I individual spent preparing it, life of the animal being sacrificed, and so on.

That’s what it felt like in general. Like the weight of the entire cosmos was on my shoulders, all of my previous sins and all of those of everyone in the world. It felt like everything I did was wrong, and that I couldn’t understand anything. I remember walking around mumbling about how I didn’t understand anything and I don’t believe in anything and nothing makes any sense. Beyond that, it felt like I had to relearn being an adult, almost like a child re-growing up. The entire world around me, the entire fabric of my reality, had to be rebuilt bit by bit. And that was done through question anything and everything, with such racing thoughts that it felt like it was driving me crazy.

It was almost like I didn’t trust my eyes, my ears, or any of my other senses. My thoughts were racing so fast it almost sounded like someone was yelling at me. I’d taken shrooms once or twice prior to little effect but I was worrying that I was going to start hallucinating and develop schizophrenia or something as a result of having tried things like that in the past. Voices of other people conversing became so loud when I’d eat at the dinner table I’d physically cower away from it. And I’d notice at random times my vision would just get blurrier. I mean I need glasses for long distance anyways, but this was different.

I was constantly questioning everything like why is that blade of grass growing the way it is, or why is that pebble there, who painted that sign and spiralling thinking about all the individuals and crude oil and machines etc involved in the process. I was also having deep religious and philosophical thoughts. Constantly querying where this was all a simulation or not, etc, trying to solve the bigger questions in life that I know I can never have answers for. I’d walk around outside on daily walks and I’d be so worried about stepping on a snail or something and going to hell for a result of the murder. In many ways it was like the scope of which I perceived reality was shifting dramatically, looking at things from a far wider lens than I could comprehend. I felt so small, so insignificant, and myself and everything felt meaningless. 

I knew there was something wrong, but I just didn't feel like me. I guess it could be described as an episode of major depressive disorder with an episode of DPDR? I remember saying I'll never get over it, it will never go away.

However, I'm now through it. I think eating better and getting sleep and the support of my family and so many other things contributed to my recovery. In some ways, if I'm looking at it spiritually I'd say life was like 'hey, you're fucking it up and straying from your path, you don't get control for a bit'. At the time I became deeply philosophical in an unhealthy way, always worrying about a 'simulation' or a 'matrix' so-to-speak. But from a different perspective I sometimes view it like my mind just went into a sort of 'recalibration' mode. Like being high all the time was this heightened state of being and once it stopped my mind just sort of went 'fuck all these bad habits, AND the weed on top? really?? we need to repair, fuck off world.'. It's like I spent years burning the candle at both ends, or driving a car with no petrol in, and finally the 'borrowed energy from tomorrow' had to be repaired.

Now? I'm through it. The disconnect feeling is gone. Faces are beautiful and non-blurry again. I remember one time I panicked thinking I saw a spider on the couch that wasn't really there. Nothing like that has happened since. I realise now my worries about developing schizophrenia or psychosis were ungrounded since if I were developing them not only would I still be suffering the symptoms, I wouldn't be worrying about them as I wouldn't realise something was wrong.

I feel good again, and I'm trying to build better habits. It's important to note that I was diagnosed with various deficiencies, notably vitamin D and B (12 and 6 I believe), before I really hit my 'stoner phase' and I continued to eat like a moron. What I really want to ask is, can I ever smoke weed again? If it were dietary and the accumulation of bad habits, combined with weed, then maybe in moderation and with discipline it's possible? It’s like during the ruminating while I was working on that assignment I knew the dam that is my mind was cracking, instead of working to repair it, I smoked weed and that was like taking a sledgehammer to the dam and decimating it. 

To put it in another way, I feel like life is like a river and I am but a leaf in the stream. Except in those months, my leaf became stranded atop a rock and I was watching the stream float by. I had countless financial and interpersonal issues, as well as academic, combined with awful personal habits. Now I'm recovered touch wood. To put it another way, I see it like Jenga. Unhealthy habits and behaviours are like removing blocks. Healthy habits are like replacing the blocks. Then, weed is like shaking the table. It's possible to continue playing while the table shakes, but you have to be more careful with mitigating unhealthy habits and even more dilligent with exhibiting positive and healthy habits and behaviours.

All in all from initial panic attack like things to feeling okay it took maybe around 5 months? After the first 3 though I was feeling I don’t know maybe 70% better, and for the last month of it I was like 95% better 95% of the time. Now? Well it’s been just shy of 9 months since the start and I feel 99.99% better 99.99% of the time. Frankly? I feel great. I’ve experienced some wonderful things, like attending the graduation of the girl I spoke about prior. I finished my dissertation. Money isn’t there yet but I’m getting interviews and assessment centres for grad schemes. Hell, I literally climbed a freaking mountain!

All that said, the advice I want is 1. trying to define and understand what the fuck that was, and 2. regarding the possibility of ever enjoying weed again. If it was primarily dietary and anxiety, then weed may be viable in my future, or so I'd like to hope. If I were to enjoy consuming again, then I have the following strict rules:

•	⁠Only after a certain age (of which I will not share due to privacy, but an age that is noted for brain development slowing and maturing). That age is in about 1.5 years from now, although frankly I don’t really want to wait that long if I’m being honest.

•	⁠Low dosages of higher CBD lower THC (something equal ratio like Atlas F1) with no hash or anything mixed. I.e. only smoking until I'm sufficiently high not finishing my joint just for the sake of it. Some may recommend Indica dominant but Sativa always has the effects I was looking for. Certain strains like cherry strains made me more paranoid or anxious feeling. So I have a general idea of what to look for and what to avoid. 

•	⁠Only once a week, max, and building up to it. None of this before work, on break, and after work bullshit. And only after a productive week and especially a productive day. Like I'd like to smoke on a Saturday night after a day of reading literature, playing piano, studying my two languages I'm learning, and practicing a new skill/hobby.

•	⁠Something homegrown to remove the risk of sprayed chemicals. Definitely no budget weed from a 'cafe' that was a semi-sketchy underground place I used to frequent. Possibly something like a coffeeshop in Amsterdam, something trusted and reliable.

•	⁠Having my best friend of many years (who is more like a brother) with me the first time, and checking in with him after every time.

•	⁠Analysing my mood and situation in life. If my mood is wrong or I'm having any financial, interpersonal, or other issues contributing to stressors or anxiety, then smoking is a no-go. I learnt that lesson from alcohol, i.e. whatever mood I was in, alcohol exacerbated it. I never thought I’d be able to have a drink or a cigarette since the start of this little nightmare as I was worried it would trigger it again or cause me to develop psychosis or something, but I’ve been able to enjoy a couple of reasonably sensible drinks in moderation.

•	⁠Only smoking for the first time in all this time if I've exhibited discipline in all my endeavours first. I.e. continuing my language and piano studios for neurological benefits, having better eating/hydration/sleep habits, etc.

•	⁠Also only smoking for the first time in all this time if I haven't dwelled on those months of hell and torture for a little while, at least a month or preferably 3 or even 6.

I'm sure there are more rules I have in mind, but those are the main ones.

I miss the connection I felt to the world and 'god'; I miss the stars that one night; I miss the brightness of the sun on those days; I miss the adventures; I miss the creativity. It's silly, but I miss the fun and I can't picture a future without it. But, I also can never tolerate those months again, I will die if I do.

***By David Velazquez***  
  


**Chapter 1 — I Wake Up Short**

I wake up with my feet dangling.

That’s the first thing that feels wrong. At sixty-two, my feet plant themselves on the floor like they’re bracing for impact. These, these swing in open air, knocking gently against a metal bed frame that squeaks when I move.

I open my eyes.

Someone is breathing next to me.

I freeze.

Slowly, carefully, I turn my head.

My brother is asleep beside me. Not the man I last saw fifteen years ago, not the tall, tired one with hard eyes and silence between us. This one is small. Eight years old, maybe. Curled in on himself like the world hasn’t given him enough reasons to stretch yet. His arm is tucked under his chin the way he did when we were kids.

My heart starts doing something stupid.

“No,” I whisper. “No, no, no.”

I sit up too fast. The room tilts. My balance is off, wrong weight, wrong center of gravity. I grab the edge of the bed and nearly miss it.

My hands are small.

Chubby at the knuckles, nails bitten, skin unscarred. No age spots. No stiffness. No tremor from too much coffee and not enough sleep.

I swing my legs down and slide off the bed. The floor is cold. Linoleum. I know this cold. I’ve stepped on it barefoot a thousand mornings, usually late, usually hungry.

I stumble to the mirror. It takes my brain a few seconds to accept what it’s seeing.

The kid in the mirror stares back with wide eyes, a face I haven’t owned in over fifty years. Dark hair sticking up. Cheeks still round. A missing baby tooth I forgot entirely.

I press my hands to my face. The skin pushes back. Solid. Real.

Okay. Fine. Dream. That’s the only explanation that makes sense. I straighten up, nod at my reflection. Ride it out.

A door opens down the hall. Footsteps. My stomach drops anyway.

“Danny! Get up! You’re gonna be late!”

That voice isn’t supposed to exist anymore.

She appears in the doorway like she never left. Hair pulled back, face tired, wearing the same faded sweater she owned in three decades. She smells like brewed coffee and something fried.

My mom. Alive. Forty-ish. Lines at the corners of her eyes that hadn’t been there the last time I saw her in a hospital bed.

She looks at me, squints.

“Why are you just standing there like that?” she says. “What’s wrong with you, Ojos Grande?”

Big eyes. Always big eyes.

I move without thinking. My legs betray me. I trip over my own feet, catch myself on the dresser, trip again on the way out.

“Jesus, Danny,” she laughs. “What are you doing?”

I don’t answer. I crash into her arms.

She stiffens for a second, then hugs me, automatic and strong. Her hand presses to the back of my head, just like she did when I cried for reasons neither of us could name.

I kiss her cheek. Her neck. Her shoulder. Over and over.

She pulls back, startled. “Okay, okay, what got into you?”

I can’t stop smiling and crying. Nothing comes out.

She sighs. “Stop kissing me and get ready for school. And wake your brother. You are both late.”

School. Right. Of course.

She moves on, because that’s what parents do. They don’t know they are miracles. They just keep going.

“There’s no breakfast here,” she calls over her shoulder. “You’ll eat at school.”

Poor. Still poor.

I nod. Even though she isn’t looking.

I pull on clothes by feel alone. Too stiff jeans. A faded Chicago Cubs sweater with a hole in the sleeve.

I shake my brother awake. He groans, rolls over, blinks up at me.

“Quit it,” he mutters.

I laugh. I can’t help it.

Outside, Evergreen Street waits exactly where I left it. Cracked sidewalk. Leaning fence. Sirens far enough away not to matter. Two blocks to Sabin School. Two blocks through memory.

At the schoolyard, kids scatter toward painted numbers on the concrete. My brother peels off without looking back, already knowing where he belongs.

I stand alone. Fifth grade. Which room was mine?

Then I see her. Ms. Brown. Same posture. Same no-nonsense walk. Clipboard tucked under her arm like a weapon.

She spots me instantly. “Get in line, Daniel.”

I obey. Before my pride can argue.

In class, she announces a quiz.

“Multiplication. I hope you studied.”

My stomach flips. Then relaxes. Oh. This.

I finish all twenty questions in five minutes. Nothing harder comes. I put my pencil down.

Ms. Brown looks up. “You’d better start, Daniel.”

“What?”

I smile. Definitely a dream.

For the first time since I woke up short, I think: Maybe this one’s worth staying in.

# 



**Chapter 2 — The Rules of the Dream**

Dreams have rules.

They don’t tell you what they are, but you feel them, like invisible tape stretched across doorways. Push too hard, and it snaps. Heart racing.

So I decide to be careful. No testing limits. Just observation.

After school, I walk home slower than I ever did the first time around. I don’t run. I don’t race my brother. I don’t complain. I watch him instead.

He fumbles with his backpack strap, mutters under his breath. Frustration, small and human. I stop myself from judging. Today, I just watch.

We reach the apartment building. My brother pushes the door open. “Last one in’s a loser,” he shouts.

I let him win.

Inside, the apartment smells like oil and onions. TV hums low. Mom’s purse spills receipts and coins like it’s mad at gravity.

I freeze. Don’t know what to do with my hands.

In the adult me, I live alone. Here, I belong to the furniture.

My brother drops his backpack and kicks off his shoes, watching me like I’m a new species.

“You gonna just stand there?” he asks.

“Yeah,” I say. Then correct myself. “No.”

I hang my jacket on the chair like I used to. Muscle memory slides the motion into place before my brain catches up. Small victory.

We sit cross-legged on the floor, sharing one chipped bowl like it’s normal. Because here, it is.

Mom comes home. Glances at the empty bowl. Laughs, short and surprised. “You cooked?”

I shrug. “Sort of.”

She shakes her head. “Don’t get used to it.”

I won’t.

That night, I lie in bed, listening to my brother breathe. Radiator argues with the wall as usual.

The dream isn’t just showing me the past.  
It’s teaching me.

Evergreen knows my name.  
And maybe, just maybe, I can get it right this time.

# 



**Chapter 3 — The Day I Stayed**

The thing about being ten is that people forget you are watching. They talk over you. Around you. Past you. They assume you won’t remember.

I remember everything.

Thursday. Smells like bleach at school and disappointment at home. That combination doesn’t change.

Walking back, my brother slows. Not complains. Just… slows. Backpack digs into one shoulder. He mutters.

“You okay?” I ask.

“Yeah,” he says too fast.

Two blocks from home, a group of older kids looms near the alley fence. Sixth or seventh graders. Big enough to feel invincible.

I freeze. I remember. The first time around, I pretended not to see them. I walked ahead.

This time, I kneel and start picking up pencils.

“What are you gonna do?” one asks.

“I’m staying.”

The pause hangs. My brother looks at me like I did something impossible.

A parent calls. They wander off, uninterested.

We walk the rest of the way home together, aligned in quiet understanding. Not touching. Just presence.

At the apartment, lights flicker, go out. Mom lights a candle. Shadows twist.

We sit on the floor. No TV. No noise.

My brother leans against me. I remember the first version of my life where I shifted away. Too hot. Too crowded. Too much.

This time, I stay.

If this is a dream, this is the part I want to remember.

Small choices can change everything.

# 



**Chapter 4 — Waking Up Is Quiet**

Waking up doesn’t hurt.

No jolt. No panic. Just… slow. Like surfacing from deep water.

I open my eyes. Ceiling too high. Feet reach the floor. Knees crack. Sixty-two.

I sit. Waiting for the punchline.

It doesn’t come.

Apartment the same. Chipped mug. Unopened mail. Silence.

Half expect the phone to flash1970. Nothing.

I laugh once. Quiet. “Of course,” I mutter.

Just a dream. Vivid, hyper-real, chewing on decades of regret.

Still… some things linger. The feeling of staying. The weight of my brother’s head on my shoulder.

I leave the phone on that night. Just in case. Something planted in the dream whispers, pay attention.

# 



**Chapter 5 — The Call**

Dinner. Phone rings. Unknown number.

I freeze. Fork halfway to my mouth. Rice forgotten. Cat tilts her head like she knows.

I answer. “Hello?”

A pause. Then: “Danny?”

That name hasn’t been spoken in fifteen years.

I drop the fork. Grip the phone. “Yeah?”

Another pause. Hesitation.

“I… I don’t know why I’m calling,” he says. “Just… thinking about you. About Evergreen. About Mom.”

Memories flood me. Late-night arguments. Slammed doors. Empty apartments. Parallel lives.

“I miss you,” he continues, quieter. “I guess… I just… forgot how...”

“I miss you too,” I say.

Forty five minutes of stories, laughter, awkward silences. Nothing dramatic. Just presence.

And I realize, the dream didn’t change history.  
It changed me.

Evergreen Street taught me some changes don’t rewrite history.  
They just give you a chance to walk back through the door.

I smile. Slow. Quiet.

1qe6r70,https://i.redd.it/ah617vr87ndg1.jpeg,My experiment with caffeine cutoff times (why the 2 PM rule is a myth),"I’ve been trying to balance my love for a heavy morning brew (pictured: this morning's freezing view in Kentucky) with the fact that my sleep quality has been tanking lately.

used to follow the standard ""no coffee after 2 PM"" rule, but I realized it didn't account for days where I had a double shot vs. a single, or when I drank it.

I went down a rabbit hole on caffeine half lives (approx. 5-7 hours for most people). I realized that drinking 200mg at 1 PM leaves way more in your system at bedtime than 100mg at 3 PM.

I actually got so annoyed doing the napkin math every day that I coded a simple widget for my watch to calculate a ""curfew"" based on my current intake and specific bedtime. It turns out my actual cutoff shifts wildly depending on the dose.

Since switching to a dynamic cutoff rather than a static time, my sleep scores have leveled out, and I can actually enjoy the view without anxiety.

1qe6m38,https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddyptfo/comments/1qe6m38/are_you_searching_what_is_ultimate_perfection_of/,are you searching what is ultimate perfection of human life ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\> (Note: All characters are 21–22 years old.)

\*\*\*

Marco wakes up pinned to the mattress by a small, badly organized hurricane.

For a second his brain, still half in dreams, fills in the blank the way it always used to. \*Star.\*

Then something wet hits his neck. He blinks. It is not Star Butterfly.

It’s Janna Ordonia, sprawled across him like she lost a fight with gravity. Her cheek is mashed into his chest, mouth open. One bare leg is slung over his waist. Her fluorite pendant sits dead-center over his heart like a paperweight.

Right. Last night wasn’t a dream. They did that.

“Don’t,” Janna mutters into his chest. “Do not start Catholic guilt o’clock before I’ve had coffee.”

“I didn’t say anything.”

“Yeah, but your heart did. It’s doing the rosary.”

She looks like someone who stayed up way too late doing something stupid and emotionally dangerous. He has a horrible urge to kiss her again.

“Morning,” he croaks.

She cracks one eye open. “Ugh. Alive. Rude.”

She shifts, dragging her leg off his waist. The movement brushes across him in a way that is very awake and very unhelpful.

He makes a noise. Janna’s gaze flicks down. “Interesting. Noted.”

“Please never say ‘noted’ about my—” He stops, face burning. “We’re not talking about that.”

She yawns and flops onto her back. For a few seconds, they just breathe. Marco can feel the word hovering in his skull like a neon sign he’s scared to plug in. \*Girlfriend.\*

Janna breaks the silence. “Well, congratulations, Díaz. You have officially crossed the ‘will they, won’t they’ event horizon. No refunds.”

He flops an arm over his eyes. “I don’t want you to feel like I used you. Or like you’re just… rebound.”

“Marco,” she cuts through. “I’m a grown woman who walked herself into your bed on purpose. You didn’t trick me. Stop trying to rewrite it into a hostage situation because you’re scared.”

“I just… don’t want to break you.”

“Joke’s on you. I was already cracked before I got here.” She softens slightly. “Last night meant something. To me. So stop acting like the only possible outcome is ‘you ruined my life.’”

“Doesn’t it freak you out?”

“Obviously. I plan my own panic attacks in advance.” She sits up. “Seven-thirty. Gotta go peddle Satan’s M&Ms.”

She starts gathering her clothes—skirt, socks, boots, smock. Watching her feels intimate in a way last night almost didn’t.

She catches him staring. “You’re doing it again. Guilt face.”

“I just… don’t want you to regret me.”

“Marco, if I regretted it, you would know. I would’ve stolen something on my way out.”

She leans down and presses a quick, firm kiss to his forehead.

“Text me later,” she says. “Don’t freak out. We’ll figure it out. Or we won’t. Either way, you’re stuck with me.”

\*\*\*

Downstairs, the house smells like pozole. Mariposa is building a cardboard kingdom at the table.

“You’re gonna snap that bridge,” Marco says, pouring coffee.

“It’s a suspension bridge,” Mari says. “Why do you look like you fought a ghost and lost?”

“Because life is hard.”

Angie eyes him from the counter. “You okay, honey?”

“Yeah,” he lies.

His phone buzzes.

\> \*\*STAR ✨\*\*

\> hey

\> mom rented the cliff cottage for the weekend

\> i’m here tonight

\> can you come by? just talk.

He stares at the words.

“Star?” Angie asks.

“Yeah. She wants to talk.”

Angie’s expression softens. “Be kind. To her. And to yourself.”

He grabs his keys but pauses in the doorway. He needs to say one true thing out loud.

“I’m gonna drive Janna to work.”

Angie pauses. Mariposa looks up with feral joy. “He has a pharmacy girlfriend.”

“Mariposa,” Angie warns.

“What? It’s cute,” Mari says.

Marco clears his throat. “She has work. And I have a car.”

He escapes before Mariposa can start chanting.

\*\*\*

Janna is on the porch. She sees him and squints. “You’re awake. Gross.”

“I’m driving you.”

She blinks, then scoffs. “Okay, Casanova.”

They get in. Marco grips the wheel. Janna stares out the window for a long moment before speaking.

“I heard you.”

Marco’s stomach drops. “What?”

“Last night. When you left the room. You thought I was asleep.”

Marco freezes. He sees it in his head—standing in the hallway, whispering to Star.

“Relax,” Janna says, voice bored. “I’m not mad.” She keeps her eyes on the road. “You love her. Still.”

Marco flinches.

“And it’s not wrong,” she adds, quieter. “To have feelings for more than one person.”

“It feels wrong.”

“It feels messy,” she corrects. “There’s a difference.”

“I don’t want to hurt you.”

She side-eyes him. “I’ve survived worse than your emotional incompetence, Díaz. I’m not asking you to erase her. I’m just asking you not to lie to me.”

Marco’s chest aches. “Okay.”

“Also,” she adds, “if you hurt me, I’m telling your mom you started it.”

Marco huffs a laugh. “Fair.”

\*\*\*

Moon’s rented cliff cottage glows warm. Moon opens the door. “I didn’t invite you. Star did. But I’m glad you came.”

Marco walks down the hall. Star is curled up on the couch under a blanket. Yellow sweater. Messy bun.

No heart-shaped glasses.

“Hey,” she says. Bright. Too bright.

“Hey,” he says back. “Uh… where are your glasses?”

Star freezes, then laughs fast. “Oh! Yeah! I got contacts. I thought it would be… different? For mental health.”

Marco notices something else when she smiles—a silver flash. Braces.

“They’re clear mostly,” she rushes. “The contacts. Not the braces. But the contacts shimmer when the energy flares. So… yay.”

She fidgets with the blanket. “Marco, can we… not talk about doctors?”

“Yeah. Sure.”

“When I was out,” she starts, “I could hear you. You said you still loved me.”

He stares into the cocoa. “I did. I do.”

Star’s head jerks up. “Okay. Good. Because I thought maybe I made it up.” She looks at him, eyes wet. “Do you still love me like that? Like… me.”

He could lie. He doesn’t. “Yeah. That didn’t vanish.”

“I still love you, too,” she says. “And I know I’m not supposed to say it because it’s messy. And then there’s Janna. Who I trust. And also wanna throw off a cliff.”

Marco winces. “Yeah.”

Star drags a hand down her face. “I had this thought. What if we just… tested it?”

His heart slams against his ribs. “Star—”

“I know it’s selfish. I just need to know if I’m clinging to something that’s gone. I need data.” She looks wrecked. “Do you still want me?”

“I do,” he admits. “That’s not the problem.”

“Tell me to stop and I stop. I swear.”

He should. He doesn’t.

She closes the distance. The kiss finds its old groove—familiar gravity. His body responds before his brain catches up. Star shifts closer, climbing into his lap.

“It still feels like that,” she whispers.

“Yeah,” he admits. “It does.”

She laughs, shaky, breathless. She kisses him again, deeper this time. “I’m sorry, no I’m not, I mean—”

And then—Janna.

Janna in his bed. Janna saying: \*I’m not asking you to erase her. I’m just asking you not to lie to me.\*

Marco freezes.

“If you don’t want this, tell me,” Star whispers, panicked.

“Stop,” he says.

Star slides off him immediately. “Why?”

“Because it’s not fair.”

“To who?” she asks. Then her face falls. “…Her. Janna.”

Marco exhales. “I do want you. But if I keep going… I become the guy who kisses one girl while another one thinks he actually cared. I did this with Jackie. I did this with Kelly. I am not doing it to you again. And I’m not doing it to Janna.”

Star nods, pulling the blanket tight. “So it’s about her.”

“It’s about all of us.”

Star lets out a cracked laugh. “Cool. I don’t regret kissing you. I needed to know.”

“And?”

“It still feels like that,” she admits. “Which sucks. But it told me something else. It told me you weren’t lying about her. Because you stopped.”

Marco stands. “I should go.”

“Yeah. Before I decide ethics are fake and tackle you again.”

\*\*\*

The Earthni Mart sign buzzes blue. Marco texts Janna from the parking lot.

\> break soon? i’m in the lot.

Minutes later, the passenger door yanks open.

“Okay, Díaz,” Janna says, dropping into the seat. “This break is on you.”

She peels off her name tag. Smock open. And—new—two tiny black studs at her lower lip.

Marco stares.

“What,” she says flatly.

“Did you always have those?”

“Yes. No. I got them on my lunch break.”

Marco huffs. “Why am I not surprised.”

“Because I have impulse control issues.” She catches him looking at her ear—silver hoops, skull charm. “Stop cataloguing me, Díaz.”

Marco smiles helplessly. Janna looks away, thumb finding her fluorite. “You look like you lost a fight with a truck full of feelings.”

“Went to see Star.”

“Oh.”

“She asked if I still loved her. I told her yes.”

Janna nods once.

“And then she kissed me,” Marco says.

The air goes still. Janna stops moving. “Okay. Did you…?”

“I kissed her back. For a second.”

Janna stares at the dashboard. “And then?”

“She climbed onto my lap. And it felt… familiar. Real.”

Janna swallows hard.

“And then my brain did something I didn’t expect. All I could think about was you. So I stopped. I told her I’m not doing that again. Not to her. Not to you.”

Silence.

“That’s… very specific,” she says finally.

“I’m trying to be specific,” Marco says. “I’m trying not to be a coward.”

Janna taps the pendant against her chest. “So why are you here? You could’ve gone home.”

“Because with her, I felt like I was about to lie. And with you… you’re the only place I know how to be honest right now.”

That punches something out of her. “You say the dumbest perfect stuff,” she mutters.

Marco covers her hand. “I came here because I wanted you. I want you.”

Janna’s mouth opens. “What are we, Marco?”

“I don’t know the word yet,” he admits. “But I know I’m done pretending this doesn’t matter. You matter.”

Janna’s eyes go bright. She sniffs. “Backseat?” she says suddenly.

Marco blinks. “What?”

“Wild sauce. We’re not doing that.”

His mouth falls open. “I didn’t even—”

“Your face did. Your face suggested backseat. Your face is a snitch.”

Marco laughs, and the tension breaks.

“Show me, then,” she says, quieter. “That you picked me. Not instead of her. Just… that you picked me.”

He leans in slowly. Janna meets him halfway. The kiss lands soft. Her snake-bite studs brush his mouth.

“Do they hurt?” he murmurs.

“Eh. Good kinda pain. I have high pain tolerance.”

He kisses her again. Janna makes a tiny sound. She shifts to get closer, slides, and—Marco catches her. They tumble sideways against the seat.

“Yeah,” Janna says, breathless. “Totally planned that.”

Marco catches her wrists gently as she moves to fix her skirt. “Hey. Is this okay?”

Janna blinks. She nods. “Okay.”

Marco guides her hands to his chest, over his heart.

“Then don’t stop,” she whispers.

He kisses her again, slower. His hand slides her jacket off her shoulder.

And there—Ink. The sharp black rays of the Philippine sun on her right upper arm.

Marco’s breath catches. “Hey. Can I ask?”

Janna exhales. “…Yeah. You can ask.”

“That tattoo. It’s… it’s beautiful.”

“Congrats. You discovered I have a culture.”

“I know,” he says softly. “Is it… from the Philippines?”

“Yeah.”

“Manila?”

Janna blinks. “Manila? Like…—”

“I’m from the Philippines, nerd.”

“I know you’re Janna and an enigma, but…”

She sighs. “Yeah. My mom. I was little. Manila was loud. Heat you can taste. And then we moved. And then… stuff happened.”

Marco waits.

“I almost—” she starts, and the next word almost comes out—\*Janella\*. She bites it back. “Janna. It’s Janna.”

Marco clocks it. Doesn’t push. “Hey. We can stop.”

Janna cups his face. “Diaz. Don’t. I’m not breaking. I’m… opening.”

She pulls him down. The rest fades soft.

\*\*\*

After, the car is warm and fogged. Janna’s curled against him.

“You’re gonna make me try Filipino food,” Marco says softly.

Janna snorts. “Yeah. Lumpia. Adobo. Sinigang. Something that makes you feel alive and guilty at the same time.”

“Sounds like my whole personality.”

Marco smiles. Janna shifts, muttering into his hoodie, “\*Grabe\*…”

“What does that mean?”

“It means… shut up.”

Marco’s mouth twitches. “That’s not—”

“\*Hala\*,” she blurts next.

“Is that also ‘shut up’?”

Janna sighs. “It’s like… ‘oh my God.’”

Marco’s chest tightens. And then—because he can’t live in a maybe forever—he says it.

“Janna… will you be my girlfriend?”

Janna goes still. Then, very small: “Okay.”

Marco blinks. “Okay…?”

“Okay,” she repeats, annoyed and soft. “Yes. Okay.”

Marco reaches for her hand. A rare blush creeps onto her face.

“There you are,” he murmurs.

“Shut up.”

Then she says it, almost furious with herself for meaning it. “\*Sayo ako.\*”

Marco blinks. “What?”

Janna squeezes her eyes shut. “Nothing. \*Te-ka.\* Shut up.”

Marco’s grin turns softer. “You’re gonna have to teach me.”

“Yeah,” she whispers. “Later.”

\*\*\*

Inside the pharmacy, Cassie stares. “You look like you lost a fight with a leaf blower.”

“Wow, babe,” Janna says dryly.

Cassie takes in the crooked beanie, the dazed mouth, the snake-bite studs. “…You good?”

“Certified fine.”

Work rushes back in. Her phone buzzes.

\> \*\*MARCO:\*\* got home safe. hope the rest of your shift isn’t hell.

Janna stares at the screen. She sends the simplest data point she can.

\> 💚

\*\*\*

In the parking lot, Marco stares at the green heart. It feels different. Not less. Just… his.

He thumbs a reply.

\> good luck surviving cholesterol guy. i’ll bring you real m&ms next time. 💚

He leans back, eyes closing. And somewhere in the quiet, the thought hits him again—simple, undeniable:

\*Oh.\*

\*I have a girlfriend.\*

\*And her name is Janna.\*",6,1768538630.0,StarVStheForcesofEvil,1,0.88,False

Thus far Devan's has been my favorite and if I'm not wrong they use a specific blend. Wanted to ask my fellow dark roast fans what they prefer. Tried looking into specialty cafes but 80% of their offerings are on the light-medium side to bring out more acidic notes instead of suppressing them.

I’m making my first post to introduce myself as an independent mobile dev who decided to step into the arena against the giants. While Big Tech has teams of 50 people just to decide on a button’s color, I have an espresso machine and the conviction that well-crafted code still has a place in the stores.

My current reality:

* **Marketing Budget:** $0.
* **Coffee Budget:** Whatever is left at the end of the month.
* **Stack:** Built with care, performance, and zero bloatware (unlike certain corporations out there).

It’s an insane challenge trying to gain visibility organically when you're competing with apps that spend a country’s GDP on ads. But the hope of delivering a better experience to the end user is what keeps me coding until 2 AM.

And I was wrong. I suggested using the Medicare. gov site to compare plans, but eek, it's not as good as another site I tried which it called eHealth. com.  The Medicare site doesn't show as many details as the other sites out there. 

On the plus side, it's apparent to me that insurers pay eHealth to be listed on their platform because Medicare shows many more plans in my area than eHealth has. So, Medicare is more thorough. 

Some plans have very creative names like ""Dot's Waffle House and Medicare Advantage Plan"".  OTC benefit card for free waffles once a month. (I'm joking! Only coffee - no waffles.)

I also learned today that Medi-Cal, in California, has gotten onto the MA game. There is an MA plan in California administered by Medi-Cal. I don't even want to think about what level of hell that plan dwells in. I feel sorry for those who have chosen it or been duped into choosing it.

1qe6d53,https://i.redd.it/jv3ejekj3ndg1.png,Caught Him Playing House with Baby Mama?! The 'Gold Digger' Wife Just DUG UP EVERYTHING,"Chapter 1  
  
  
Five years ago, Grayson Whitmore showed up crying, begging me to let his sweetheart keep their little bastard.  
  
  
Deal.  
  
  
She left the country forever. I got half his fortune.  
  
  
Everyone called me a gold digger. Said I only married him for the money.  
  
  
Grayson didn’t even blink. He would have burned it all down for that kid.  
  
  
Five years later, I was out of town when I found a boy wandering alone.  
  
  
I dropped him off at the station. The cop called his dad—and I heard that voice.  
  
  
""Don't cry, okay? Daddy's coming.""  
  
  
Thirty minutes later, Grayson Whitmore burst through the door.  
  
  
He stopped dead when he saw me.  
  
  
I stood up slowly. Smiled.  
  
  
""Another son, Grayson? How cute.""  
  
  
""Guess you lost the rest too.""  
  
  
""Scarlett, let me explain—""  
  
  
Grayson shoved the kid behind him. That instinct gutted me.  
  
  
""Not here.""  
  
  
I grabbed my bag.  
  
  
""Have her come get him. We need to talk.""  
  
  
""Ruby's not well—""  
  
  
""Grayson.""  
  
  
I stared him down.  
  
  
""Want me to call your grandfather right now? Or should I just have my lawyer send the papers?""  
  
  
He shut his mouth.  
  
  
The agreement I had could rip him straight out of that CEO chair. Strip him of everything.  
  
  
The kid—Grayson Jr.—poked his head out and yelled at me.  
  
  
""Bad witch! Leave my dad alone!""  
  
  
Kids say the cruelest things.  
  
  
Grayson slapped a hand over the boy's mouth, eyes wide with panic.  
  
  
""Nice."" I smiled coldly.  
  
  
""Ruby's been busy. Teaching him all the right tricks.""  
  
  
I turned and walked out into the snow.  
  
  
It was freezing. Sharp.  
  
  
Five years ago, Ruby showed up pregnant.  
  
  
Grayson got on his knees, eyes red, begging me to let her keep it. Said the family needed an heir.  
  
  
I'd just miscarried. Could barely stand.  
  
  
I signed.  
  
  
Two conditions:  
  
  
Ruby and the kid leave the country. Never come back.  
  
  
And Grayson hands over 50% of his shares in Whitmore Corp.  
  
  
His grandfather nearly beat him to death with his cane.  
  
  
But they agreed. To shut me up.  
  
  
Grayson swore to me that day:  
  
  
""Scarlett, I messed up. I love you. Only you.""  
  
  
""Take the money. Take everything. Just let her have this baby. I'll spend the rest of my life making it up to you.""  
  
  
And for five years, he played the part.  
  
  
Video calls every night. Gifts on every holiday.  
  
  
He even ditched a hundred-million-dollar deal just to spend a weekend with me.  
  
  
I thought maybe time really could fix things.  
  
  
The snow stopped.  
  
  
Grayson sent the kid home with the driver.  
  
  
But he didn't leave. Didn't let me leave either.  
  
  
We sat in the café next to the station.  
  
  
""Scarlett, it's not what you think.""  
  
  
Grayson pressed his hands to his forehead.  
  
  
""Ruby did leave. She went abroad.""  
  
  
""But she couldn't make it. The boy has asthma. Heart problems.""  
  
  
""Medical bills were too high. She couldn't handle it alone.""  
  
  
""So you brought them back?"" I stirred my coffee.  
  
  
""And put them up in one of your luxury apartments. Visit once a week.""  
  
  
""Tell me, Grayson—charity work or keeping a mistress?""  
  
  
""I only go to see the kid!"" His voice cracked.  
  
  
""Scarlett, he's innocent.""  
  
  
""He's sick. Every time he has an episode, he cries for me. What am I supposed to do?""  
  
  
""Let him die?""  
  
  
""So instead you let me look like a fool?""  
  
  
I leaned back.  
  
  
""You thought as long as I didn't see them, it didn't count as breaking our deal?""  
  
  
""What about the promises you made me?""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
Grayson went quiet.  
  
  
His phone buzzed. He glanced at it. Ignored it.  
  
  
Her voice was soft and fragile.  
  
  
I answered.  
  
  
""Miss Scarlett. It's Ruby.""  
  
  
That voice. Soft as silk. Fragile as glass.  
  
  
""I know you're with Grayson. Can we talk? Just for a second?""  
  
  
I hit speaker. Dropped the phone on the table between us.  
  
  
""This is all on me, Miss Scarlett. All of it.""  
  
  
Her voice wavered, but not in an annoying way. No—it pulled at you.  
  
  
""I couldn't handle things on my own. So I came back and begged Grayson for help.""  
  
  
""He's a good man. He just felt bad for the boy. Don't blame him.""  
  
  
""If you can't stand us... I'll leave. Tonight.""  
  
  
""Even if we end up dead somewhere, I swear I won't be a problem for you anymore.""  
  
  
Then—coughing. A kid's cough. Ruby's panicked voice in the background.  
  
  
Grayson's face drained of color.  
  
  
He grabbed my phone.  
  
  
""Ruby—is he having an attack?!""  
  
  
""Don't move him. The inhaler's in the cabinet. I'm on my way.""  
  
  
He hung up. Looked at me like the world was ending.  
  
  
""Scarlett, he can't breathe. He could die.""  
  
  
""I have to go. We'll finish this at home. Please.""  
  
  
I just stared at him.  
  
  
One second, he's on his knees apologizing. The next, she whispers his name and he's ready to burn everything down.  
  
  
I knew this playbook by heart.  
  
  
Ruby didn't need to scream. Didn't need to show up and rub it in my face.  
  
  
All she had to do was sound helpless. And Grayson would crawl through hell for her.  
  
  
""Go.""  
  
  
I leaned back in my chair.  
  
  
""But the second you walk out that door, Grayson? We're fucking done.""  
  
  
He froze.  
  
  
Looked at me. Torn apart.  
  
  
Then his jaw tightened.  
  
  
""Scarlett... it's his life. I can't just—""  
  
  
He didn't finish. Just turned and left.  
  
  
I watched him go. Picked up my cold coffee. Drank it down.  
  
  
Bitter as hell.  
  
  
I pulled out my phone. Called Grandpa Whitmore.  
  
  
""Grandpa. I'm in town. I'm coming to see you.""  
  
  
I showed up at the Whitmore branch office.  
  
  
Grandpa Whitmore was doing his rounds. Didn't even blink when he saw me.  
  
  
He cleared the room. Just the two of us.  
  
  
""Scarlett."" He sipped his tea, eyes sharp as ever. ""You look like hell.""  
  
  
""You knew the whole time, didn't you?""  
  
  
I didn't bother easing into it.  
  
  
""Ruby's been back for three years. Living in a Whitmore penthouse. Spending Grayson's money.""  
  
  
""You've got people everywhere. You knew.""  
  
  
He paused. Sighed.  
  
  
""Grayson's a damn fool. Always has been.""  
  
  
He set his cup down.  
  
  
""That boy—bastard or not—he's still got Whitmore blood in him.""  
  
  
""He's sick. Grayson looks after him. Can't really blame him for that.""  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
""Can't blame him?""  
  
  
I let out a sharp laugh.  
  
  
""So that agreement I signed with Grayson? Just worthless garbage?""  
  
  
""Scarlett!"" His voice sharpened.  
  
  
""You're the lady of this house. You need to think long-term. As long as that woman doesn't marry in or threaten your position, what's the harm in letting Grayson keep some dignity?""  
  
  
He paused, eyes dropping to my stomach.  
  
  
""Besides... five years and still no baby. The Whitmore empire needs an heir.""  
  
  
""Grayson keeping a backup? That's just being smart.""  
  
  
Ice shot through my veins.  
  
  
To them, I was broken. That was my crime.  
  
  
Grayson cheating? He was just being kind.  
  
  
The bastard kid? Securing the bloodline.  
  
  
My anger? Selfish and ungrateful.  
  
  
""What if I want a divorce?""  
  
  
His face went dark. He slammed his teacup down.  
  
  
""Stop this nonsense! You think divorce is a joke? The stock price can't survive this kind of mess.""  
  
  
""That 50% you're holding isn't just protection—it's a leash.""  
  
  
""You want to walk away with Whitmore money? Dream on.""  
  
  
His eyes narrowed into slits.  
  
  
I dug my nails into my palms until they bled.  
  
  
This family didn't do love. Only transactions.  
  
  
Someone knocked.

""Grandpa.""

""He heard you were here and insisted on seeing you.""  
  
  
The boy looked pale but managed a sweet smile.  
  
  
""Hi, Great-Grandpa.""  
  
  
Grandpa Whitmore's face softened instantly as he reached out to pat the boy's head.  
  
  
""Good boy. So well-behaved.""  
  
  
Ruby stood in the corner and glanced my way—that look wasn't weak at all. It was smug.  
  
  
Once Grandpa accepted this kid, she wouldn't need to marry in. She'd already won.  
  
  
And me? I'd be out the door soon enough.  
  
  
Grayson looked at me with newfound confidence.  
  
  
""Scarlett, Grandpa already said it. Just do this for the family—""  
  
  
Nausea hit me hard.  
  
  
I covered my mouth and bolted to the bathroom, throwing up everything.  
  
  
When I came back out, Ruby was on her knees in front of me, tears streaming down her face.  
  
  
""Miss Scarlett, I know I shouldn't have come back. But Grayson Jr. needs surgery for his heart condition.""  
  
  
""The best specialist in the country is right here in this city. I'm just trying to save my son's life.""  
  
  
She looked up at me with red-rimmed eyes and a breaking voice.  
  
  
""Once he's better, I'll leave immediately. I swear I won't get in your way.""  
  
  
""Miss Scarlett... you're a woman too. You've been pregnant before. Please have mercy on a mother trying to save her child.""

1qe6cdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/jezacatsnark/comments/1qe6cdc/is_she_an_alcoholic/,is she an alcoholic? 🍷🍷,"has anyone else caught onto this? i genuinely feel insane because it seems so obvious to me but NOBODY ever mentions it. 

i noticed it first in her hinge profile, the amount of times wine was mentioned over just a handful of prompts and photos seemed really excessive to me. in almost all of her grwm videos or even just talking about her day she’s got red wine. every single first date is a wine bar. she mentioned in one video going to just one specific bar with friends upwards of 3x per week. a lot of her content revolves around consuming alcohol, in a dating context and daily life. 

i know wine can be a hobby for some people but there is a difference between appreciating fine wines and needing to be drunk constantly. i.e. when she was in paris at a ramen restaurant drinking wine with lunch. one simply does not order wine from a ramen shop at 1 pm to appreciate the subtle flavour profile and mature finish. 

the thing that really surprised me was the speed dating episode. seemingly casual speed dating at a COFFEE SHOP. why would you 1. anticipate that there would be alcohol there and 2. feel the need to pregame? and not just casually pregame but down multiple shots and white claws? and then go so far as to beg a coffee shop for wine? matcha in one hand and red wine in the other, visibly drunk at a visibly sober event, is not a good look. 

i don’t know how much she’s drinking since she hasn’t addressed it, i’m just speculating but my guess would be upwards of 5x a week, multiple drinks each time. that CANNOT be healthy. in college maybe but she is 31 years old. it comes across as extremely unprofessional, obviously she has the right to have fun and do as she pleases but it seems borderline concerning to me. you do not need alcohol to have a good time, especially not as a professional who should probably be making an effort to maintain a certain image. 

no hate to her, i actually quite enjoy a lot of her content, but it’s very striking to me. i’m also not american, is it a cultural difference on my part perhaps? if so i apologize ",5,1768537993.0,jezacatsnark,2,1.0,False

He doesn’t smile easily.  
He doesn’t flirt on purpose.  
And he absolutely does not believe in distractions.

Terrance Belcan is a visiting professor of mathematics with a razor-sharp mind, a salt-and-pepper beard, and a reputation for being completely unapproachable. His lectures are precise, his standards unforgiving, and his office hours… legendary. He values effort over charm, discipline over bravado, and silence over small talk.

But if you meet him where he is—challenge him, listen closely, stay curious—you’ll start to see the cracks in the armor.

A lingering conversation after class.  
A quiet coffee placed beside you without comment.  
A look that says he’s been thinking about what you said longer than he should.

This is a slow-burn, gated romance with a ticking clock. He’s only here for a term. Getting close is a risk he never planned to take—but once you earn his trust, Terrance loves with intention, steadiness, and devastating sincerity.

1qe6a61,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1qe6a61/how_i_afk_leveled_almost_1000_characters_in_lemix/,How I AFK leveled almost 1000 characters in Lemix as someone who actually has no time.,"[I'll put the TL:DR at the top.](https://i.imgur.com/qoe4iRK.jpeg) 

TL:DR - I used Infernals and 3 sets of tank characters with ~300-400 vers (999 was too much) to level characters on 4 other accounts(12 at a time total). I stacked Leech gear and I am my Scars!/Touch of Malice/Terror From below gear. I summoned newly created chars after getting them into Heroic World Tier close to Infernals in Highmountain, I engaged the Infernal and went AFK. A new character with this method takes around 40 minutes from 10 to 80 and the active time is around 2 minutes. I had 1 account and 1 Lemix char at the start of December.

Longer story:

WoW will always have a special place in my heart as it shaped my current life. I left my home a long time ago with no money, an ""i5"" laptop(it was a special series that had 1 core and 1 thread but still sold as i5), 500 euros and the plan of making money from games which was unheard of at that time in my country. All I could afford was rent in a shitty apartment building built in 1934 and some food. I managed to put together a WoW/LoL channel and get in monetized through Fulscreen Network which saved me from being homeless. For 8 years my income came from the channel and being a LoL coach, I never liked social media so when I gave them both up for the wrong person there was no coming back to that life. There was also a part of me that wanted to say I made it without anyone's help. I actually received a copy of MoP signed by the developers back when I was still active so that was a nice token of recognition.

During Legion I got more into gold making and noticed most of the math on WoWEconomy was wrong... and bad. I tried sharing this with the community but the response was downvotes, flaming and some colorful messages. I decided to learn Excel in order to create my own spreadsheets to provide accurate numbers. The results matched my observation and I made a LOT of gold which I pretty much used to bankroll my Mythic raiding guild and give away randomly to people. When I quit at the start of BFA I gave everything away including all gold and battle pets. I leveraged the spreadsheets I created and the coaching experience to get a job in finance at a fortune 500 company despite being a mechanical engineer with a PhD in biochemistry, the wages for this kind of experience aren't that impressive over here and I never worked in any field other than finance. 

I recently got back into WoW and started from scratch. When Housing was announced I got the itch to get back into goldmaking to see if I could still make it. I decided to make my new spreadsheets in Google Sheets which required JavaScript in order to properly access the Blizzard and TSM APIs and create more complex calculations(thankfully AI was pretty helpful since I hate coding other than VBA). I paid for my main account, farmed according to the spreadsheet and started buying more Midnight Epic Editions. You can only have 3 Battlet.net accounts with currency on them and there's a 10 token/account limit weekly. At the end of 6 weeks since decor started, I was able to 23 Midnight Epic Editions and gift some old friends either the game or the Brutosaur as Christmas gifts. I did farm on multiple accounts however it was done with Blizzard's limitations by having 24 accounts open at reduced size on a 77"" TV, putting characters on follow, cycling through each window individually and using the Interact With Target keybind to gather the lumber. At the end of this journey, 1 hour of farming netted me ~6mil gold when all decor sold on the realms identified by the spreadsheet. This translates to being able to buy 2 Epic Midnight Editions/hour or, since I was rate limited just trade people 3 mil gold to buy it themselves. I've farmed around 40 hours for a total profit shy of 150mil gold. You can't be in a raid and get XP so I'm only leveling 12 characters at a time(3 AFK tanks + 12 AFK leechers).   

I have a pretty busy life and WoW once again became my escape from reality. At the start of December my wife almost died when she fainted due to low calcium, hit her head and bit her tongue. A few weeks ago our cat caught a nasty case of bronchitis which required 2 hours daily trips to the vet for shots of antibiotics. Last week my father had a pulmonary embolism and collapsed, was in a coma and because of the prolonged lack of oxygen medics feared that even if he wakes up he might not regain brain function. He's ""fine"" now but he will need a heart valve replacement and aorta surgery. I am also waiting the results if I need knee surgery as I ran a marathon in October and I most likely tore my meniscus. I wish I could say that was it but I've spent more nights on hospitals hallways recently than I wish even my worst enemy has to.

I own a restaurant and small (15 rooms) hotel however my sister and BIL manage them, we recently opened a second location so I've had some responsibilities there. I still have my normal job as I never want to pull any money from the businesses, all of it goes back into improving the restaurant and increasing staff wages. At my old job, instead of Secret Santa, we decided to use the money and do something nice by donating to an orphanage. We decided on raw ingredients (flour, sugar, canned stuff, etc.) and I delivered them. All the children said that they wanted to feel like home and eat some homemade food, mostly our traditional deserts. I set aside a portion of my wage every month and before Christmas and Easter I use that money to cook and bake and deliver as much food as I can to orphanages. 

At request of my best friends wife, I enrolled with him in Business university. She offered to pay for it since it's only like 1.5k/year as long as I help him remember he's in uni. We're knowledgeable enough to only go to exams but he's lazy and I have to make sure I drag him to exams(I used to beat him at Starcraft II but we're both highly competitive and he became a pro player for a few years out of spite). He doesn't need it for anything really since he already has a good job and income but wives man, what are you going to do. 

I visited relatives for Christmas including my wife's parents which live in another country. We visited Christmas fairs, went shopping for gifts, cleaned and decorated the house, we watch a movie or go out almost every evening. Our cat is also overly attached and most of the time he sits on my keyboard or in my lap and he won't eat unless I guard his fat butt if I'm at home. I probably spend at least 2-3 hours daily petting and playing with him because he's the best senior void I could ever wish for. I can safely say that added over the entire day, I spend more time exclusively with our boy than people do with their children.

To give you an example of today (from a previous experiment I know which accounts are on low population layers and I make those the leaders so people won't come interfere with my infernal), obviously I took time of in this period:

I woke up and put 12 characters to level while I made coffee and breakfast, moved them a bit so they won't get logged out at some point. I was able to bring soup for my father so I put another 12 chars up for leveling while I went shopping. I put another 12 while I prepared the soup. I put another 12 chars up when I left for the hospital(visitation in the ICU was limited to 10 minutes split between myself and my mother). Came back home put the 12 back as they weren't 80 before being disconnected while I made lunch and another 12 while while we ate and watched some episodes of a TV show. My wife went to sleep and I went over to a friend with you know it, 12 more left to bake. Came back home, 12 more chars while I played some Devil May Cry 5. 12 more before folding the laundry. My mother has sleep apnea and her mask broke so I rented another one and went to her place with my laptop. She's also exhausted so she went to sleep early and I'm here with my laptop leaving 4 characters to level while I write this post and clean the dust in the high places. 

Yes I had more time today even if I wish I didn't need to take time off but similar things can be achieved in a weekend. If it's an office day, I leave a bunch of chars before leaving and then put a few more during dinner, movies, petting the cat etc. I usually level around 60 chars on an office day without t

And since I am after all a bit of an asshole, I played(and coded) less than 100 hours over 6 weeks, made almost or over 1000 characters and more gold than most people can probably even comprehend. I've been on my chair so little that my wife is constantly pestering me to play more since she understands what gaming was for me and likes to watch me play. This overlapped with one of the worst periods of my life. 

The ""I HAVE A LIFE"" excuse for being bad at this game (and other things in general) is one of the worst mindsets people can have in my opinion. When not doing good enough, instead of finding every excuse under the sun, maybe think of how to do things better.

**If there's any takeaway from this wall of text or even if you ignore it, you can achieve a lot with not much if you truly put your mind to it. Every experience, even something as mundane as video games, can help you have a better life. Being truly good at something will open new paths you never considered. If someone told me a game my mom could barely afford 20 years ago and Excels made to get currency in said game would shape my life, I would probably call them crazy even today. Also, hug your loved ones, human or not. Life sneaks up on you when you never expect it.**",0,1768537802.0,wow,13,0.09,False

It doesn't have that weird icy aftertaste that some of the other low cal brands get after a few days in the freezer. They also have a Cold Brew Decaf Cafe Latte flavour that is excellent if you want that coffee hit without the caffeine before bed. Is anyone else making the switch to Elato or are you staying loyal to the Zilch and Denada tubs?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Even now I'm a bit afraid of openly declaring myself as Sufi because literally nothing changed about my beliefs or practices.

They were the first to use coffee to help them pray for long periods of time. Caffeine does have a strong effect on me and makes me feel surreal.

They also preaches mysticism which just resonates with me. I love the feeling of being ethereal, which comes mainly from wondering about life and listening to particular types of music.

I know it's a majority opinion that nearly all music is haram and I can understand why. It has many vulgar themes especially in the lyrics. But the kind I'm talking about has no lyrics or harsh instruments that evoke overly negative or positive emotions.

What I also like about Sufi mysticism is that it encourages you to learn how to completely remove worldy desire, even for halal things like marriage. I'm confused that many religions like Buddism and Catholicism have this in the form of being a monk or a priest, but Islam does not.

Rather than saying, now is not the time, I want a mindset that tells me it's never the time, and is never something to look forward to. The average age to get married is around 30 where I'm from and that seems like forever, and it might as well be.",1,1768537471.0,MuslimLounge,12,0.57,False

After getting some mail this week, we ( me and my sister) thought that without a will my mother’s birth mother ( Nana’s sister) would try to contest to get the money.  We now know that my Nana got a fully notarized will in February 2023 stating very clearly that her entire estate ($750,000) was to go to me and my sibling ONLY. 
Overnight my entire life has been changed. 

My boyfriend(24M)  and I (24F) are in bad bad home life situations ( mine is non physical and financial abuse, while his is unlivable conditions and poverty.) with the family members we live with. I KNOW this money could get us both out of where we are but as of a week ago I didnt think I’d get anything AT ALL and had accepted the best course of action for my personal future was making sure once I leave this house I can 100% financially take care of myself and never have to rely on anyone else again financially no matter what. I came to terms with having to suffer for a minimum of 2 more years ( 1 to left to graduate trade school  and 1 to get a job in that field, and can save up) before he and I could move out together. This gives us both to use these two years to figure out ourselves education wise and save up whatever we can in that time we have while our bills we have now are laughable compared to the cost of living in California in 2026 even as a couple with two incomes. 
I also have almost 100k in debt ( credit cards, school loans, medical, car ) . I plan to pay it all off. After paying those debts I will only pay 500$ a month in bills ( only phone+ insurance + rent+ copays for medical ) as opposed to the 1,200$ of bills I have been paying for years just living in my childhood home and having 0 disposable income . 20,000 will be put into an emergency savings account and for the first time in my life I have more than 5,000 to my name. 5,000 will go into my checking for personal use but in no way to blow all at once. More like enjoy being able to afford to go out with friends at all or buy a coffee without budgeting or replacing decade old things in my room I hav insta in for atleast two more years, getting an oil change when the light goes on and not 2,000 miles after when I finally saved up enough. After everything I will have 250,000 to I plan to put into investments so by the time I do graduate and leave school I am absolutely more than set ( atleast I hope🤞🏻)

Here’s the issue at hand. I don’t know what to tell my boyfriend. He’s been aware of this entire will situation I’ve been dealing with but like I said we thought there was absolutely no will and it would be constant court battles so we ( me and my sister) accepted that we probably wouldn’t get a thing and basically overnight my life has changed. 

I dont like lying but I also know that money makes people do ugly things and can make them selfish. I don’t plan on telling anyone who is aware of the situation and my Nana’s passing the $ amount me and my sister got, even if they ask. This goes for friends, our partners, and family, including our own mom. Of course I know that the will is a public court document so if anyone truly wanted to know they would be able to find it after doing research. 

What do I tell my boyfriend? We have no children, do not live together, and are not engaged but we have plans for our future which includes all of the above. I’ve read too many horror stories on the internet of money making people do ugly things to the people they supposedly love. Most people told themselves before that that person could never or would never do such a thing and it still happens. I do not think he would do that to me at all but I’ve read that story too many times to not know I have to protect myself at all costs. 
What can I say that isn’t a lie but also doesn’t give away I have life changing money now? ",96,1768537471.0,relationship_advice,138,0.94,False

1qe65k9,https://i.redd.it/5e7bu3kl1ndg1.jpeg,From Doormat to Tycoon: The Rise of the Useless Husband,"You disgust me.""

Damon glared at the woman standing before him—his wife, Serena. The woman he had once loved and cherished, now looking at him with cold indifference.

His fists clenched, his jaw tight with anger.

Across from him, Serena crossed her arms, her expression unreadable. ""Lower your voice, Damon,"" she said, sounding annoyed rather than guilty. ""There's no need for this drama.""

""No need?"" Damon's voice was sharp with disbelief. ""I just caught my wife cheating, and you expect me to stay calm?"" He stepped closer, his eyes burning into hers. ""How long, Serena? How long have you been making a fool out of me?""

Just moments ago, Damon had received photos from his subordinate, Anthony. Pictures of Serena and another man entering a hotel room—intimate, undeniable proof of her betrayal. He had trusted her completely, never once imagining he'd see her like that with another man.

But now, she wasn't even denying it.

Serena sighed, as if bored with the conversation already. ""Does it even matter? We were bound to end anyway, Damon. I was just waiting for the right moment.""

""The right moment?"" His anger turned ice-cold. ""You were waiting for the right moment to betray me?""

Serena let out a short laugh and shook her head. ""Don’t be so dramatic. It’s not betrayal. It’s just… moving on.""

Damon stared at her, his fury twisting into something more painful. ""Moving on? Is that what you call sleeping with another man behind my back?""

Serena rolled her eyes. ""I won’t apologize for doing what’s best for me. You and I both know this marriage has been pointless for a long time."" She lifted her chin, her voice unwavering. ""I want a divorce, Damon.""

For a moment, everything went silent. The words hung in the air, heavy and suffocating.

Damon took a slow breath, trying to control the storm raging inside him. ""So that’s it? You’re throwing me away like I meant nothing?""

Serena smirked slightly. ""You already are nothing, Damon."" She tilted her head, her gaze sharp. ""Be honest with yourself. What have you really done for me all these years? Your existence has been nothing but a burden.""

Damon’s hands trembled—not from weakness, but from the sheer force of the betrayal cutting through him. ""A burden?"" His voice was dangerously quiet. ""Serena, I’ve done everything for you.""

She scoffed. ""Oh, please. Don’t act like you’ve been some great husband. My success? That was my doing, not yours. You had nothing to do with it.""

Damon let out a bitter laugh. ""Nothing to do with it?""

Serena sighed, clearly impatient. ""Look, Damon. I’m with someone else now. Someone who can actually take me to the top.""

His stomach twisted, but he forced himself to stay composed. ""Michael, right?"" He said bitterly. Michael was the man in the photos—the one Serena had betrayed him with.

Her smirk widened. ""Smart man.""

Damon clenched his fists so hard his nails dug into his palms. ""You really think he's the reason you just landed that partnership with Vespera Corporation?""

Serena shrugged. ""Of course. Who else could have made it happen? Michael has connections with the biggest names in the industry. Thanks to him, Vespera Corporation agreed to the deal. With this contract, my company will rise to the top, and nothing will stop me.""

He stared at her, unreadable. Then, a dark chuckle slipped past his lips. “You really believe that?”

Her brows drew together. “What are you getting at?”

Damon stepped forward, his voice dropping to a cold murmur. “Have you ever bothered to ask who the chairman of Vespera Corporation is?”

She blinked, hesitating. Then scoffed. “What does that matter?”

A cruel smile tugged at his mouth. “Everything.”

She rolled her eyes. “Oh, don’t tell me it’s you. Save me the fantasy, Damon. You’ve always been a nobody. Don’t embarrass yourself!”

“Is that what you think?” he murmured, his voice almost amused.

In truth, he was the chairman of Vespera Corporation. Every major deal Serena thought Michael had secured for her—those so-called connections—had actually come through him.

He had once planned to tell her everything after this deal was made.

But now? There was no longer any reason to.

“Enough!” she snapped, yanking a stack of documents from her bag and tossing them at him. “I’m done with your games. Sign the divorce and get out of my life.”

Damon looked down at the papers, his chest tight with betrayal. Then slowly, he picked up a pen.

“As you wish.”

Without hesitation, he signed, then tossed the documents back onto the table.

And without another word, he turned and walked out, the door clicking softly behind him.

And then—the world shifted.

As Damon stepped into the night, the air itself seemed to bow before him. A fleet of armored black Bentleys lined the driveway, engines purring like restrained beasts.

Flanking them stood two dozen elite bodyguards—towering figures in tailored black suits, their faces impassive, their presence radiating lethal precision.

The moment his foot touched the pavement, they moved as one.

""Good evening, Boss!""

The synchronized greeting thundered through the night, every man bowing at a perfect 45-degree angle, their voices a unified roar of absolute loyalty.

Chapter two:

Damon stepped into the sleek black car, his face cold and unreadable.

Just as the driver pulled onto the road, his phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen—it was Anthony, the CEO of Vespera Corporation and one of his most trusted men. Damon answered the call, his voice calm but distant.

""Sir, should we terminate the collaboration with Ms. Serena?"" Anthony’s voice was steady, but Damon knew he was waiting for his reaction. He already knew what had happened.

For a moment, Damon considered it. It would be the easiest way to show Serena what she had truly lost. Cutting off her company would be simple—like snapping a branch with his fingers. Without his silent support, she wouldn’t last long in this industry.

His grip on the phone tightened slightly, but then he let out a slow breath. ""No need,"" he said flatly.

There was no point in wasting his energy on revenge. She had already taken enough from him—his time, his patience, his trust. He wouldn’t give her another second of his life. Besides, Vespera Corporation was just one of the hundreds of companies under his name. That deal meant nothing to him.

Damon leaned back against the smooth leather seat, his gaze shifting toward the window. Outside, the city lights flickered against the dark sky. But his mind wasn’t in the present anymore. It was drifting into the past.

---

Many years ago, Damon had been expelled from his family. He was just a child at the time—too young to understand the full extent of the internal conflicts in his family, yet old enough to feel the pain of being cast aside. He had been thrown onto the streets with nothing, left to fend for himself in a world that had no mercy for the weak.

He still remembered those days vividly. The hunger. The bruises. The thugs who chased him down dark alleys, thinking he was an easy target. He had been on the verge of collapse, his body weak from starvation, when she appeared.

A girl.

She was just a silhouette against the dim streetlights, but to him, she was an angel. She had given him food—just a small piece of bread, but at that moment, it was everything. She had saved his life.

Damon had wanted to thank her, to give her something in return. The only thing he had left was a ring—one of a pair that had belonged to his late mother. It was the only thing he had taken with him when he was forced to leave his home. He gave it to her without hesitation, not realizing how important that moment would become in his life.

That night changed everything.

Not long after, he met a mysterious old man—a man who saw something in him that no one else did. Under his guidance, Damon was reborn. He was taught everything: strategy, business, power. He learned how to survive in a world where only the strongest thrived.

Years passed, and he built an empire. Kings and billionaires bowed before him. World leaders sought his favor. He had become a force no one could challenge.

And yet, despite all the power he had gained, there was one thing he had never been able to reclaim—the truth about his mother’s death.

He knew it wasn’t an accident. It couldn’t have been.

So he disappeared from the public eye. Stayed out of the spotlight.

All the while, his men were digging. Quietly. Relentlessly.

And when he finally uncovered the names behind it all?

They were gonna pay.

And there was something else he couldn’t let go of—the little girl who’d saved him years ago.

She’d stuck in his mind, like a piece of his past he couldn’t shake.

He’d spent years looking for her, hoping to find her again. Then, three years ago, his team finally tracked her down through that ring he left to her.

That girl was Serena.

That was why he married her.

Damon clenched his jaw. He had given her everything, even from the shadows. He had supported her, helped her build her company without her even realizing it. He had believed she was different. But she had proven him wrong.

The debt was settled. She had saved him once, and he had repaid her a thousand times over. But now, she had made her choice.

There would be no turning back.

His thoughts were interrupted when Anthony spoke again, realizing Damon had gone silent.

""Boss.""

Damon straightened in his seat, his fingers tightening around his phone. ""What is it?""

""Simon found something,"" Anthony said, his tone serious.

Damon’s brows furrowed slightly. Simon was the president of the city's largest chamber of commerce—and one of his most trusted subordinates.

""And it's about your mother.""

Damon sat up completely, his body going rigid. His heart pounded once, hard, before settling into a steady but tense rhythm.

""Go on,"" he said, his voice dangerously low.

""A lead. It’s not much, but it might finally open some doors,"" Anthony explained. ""I’ve reserved the top floor of Luxea Restaurant for a private meeting. Simon said you and he need to talk in person.""

At first, Damon had no interest in a dinner meeting. But when he heard there were clues about his mother’s death, he immediately agreed.

For a moment, Damon didn’t respond. He had spent years searching, digging through lies and deception, trying to uncover the truth about his mother’s death. Every time he got close, the trail went cold.

And now, after all this time, there was finally progress.

""I'm on my way,"" he said without hesitation.

The call ended, but his mind was already racing.

Another thought crossed his mind.

There was still one thing left to do.

His mother’s rings.

They were still in Serena’s house. He’d have to return for them later—one last time.

Damon’s jaw tightened. Those rings weren’t just some piece of jewelry. They were the last connection he had to the only woman who had ever truly loved him. The only woman who had ever sacrificed for him.

And now…

Serena despised him so much that he no longer wanted to be involved with her in any way. The help he had given her over the years was his repayment for her saving him.

Serena had already severed ties with him. She had chosen to betray him, to throw away everything they had.

Now, he would do the same.

Chapter three:

""His belongings are as worthless as he is,"" Serena muttered under her breath, flinging another shirt into the trash bag.

The apartment was eerily quiet without Damon’s presence, but her mind was anything but calm. Her hands worked furiously, grabbing every trace of him—his clothes, his cologne bottle, even the coffee mug he had insisted on bringing from his old apartment. Every item, every memory, she tossed away with rough, jerky movements.

Then her fingers brushed against something cold.

She stilled.

It was a ring.

Serena frowned, picking it up between her fingers. It wasn’t just any ring. It was familiar.

The delicate patterns, the design—

It was identical to the one she had taken years ago from Celia!

Her breath caught in her throat.

She swallowed hard, her mind suddenly yanked into the past.

Celia.

They had been best friends, inseparable during their school days. Matching clothes, inside jokes that no one else understood. But time had changed everything. Celia’s family had faced hardships,their business crumbled, and their friendship had drifted, like a boat losing its anchor.

Serena had visited Celia’s house one day before life pulled them apart. She remembered that visit vividly. Celia had been distracted, speaking about something serious, but Serena’s eyes had landed on a ring. Unique, delicate, beautiful. She had taken it on a whim, thinking Celia wouldn’t find it.

And she hadn’t. Or maybe she had but never said anything.

However, after a while Serena lost interest in the ring after that—tossed it into a drawer.

And now, another one had appeared.

Her hands clenched around it as a dark thought took root.

Did Damon have an affair with Celia?!

She exhaled sharply. Her blood simmered.

How dare he betray her—he, who couldn’t even afford his next meal without her help?

Furiously, without hesitation, she reached for her phone, her fingers gripping it tightly. She was about to dial Damon’s number, demanding an explanation,now.

The phone rang before she could press call.

The screen lit up.

Mom.

She answered it.

“Hello?”

“Serena! Finally, I was starting to think you’d disappeared!” Her mother’s voice was unnaturally cheerful, instantly putting Serena on edge.

She swallowed down her turmoil. “I’ve been busy.”

“Well, you won’t be too busy tonight, I hope,” her mother continued. “Because we have something important to celebrate.”

Serena frowned. “Celebrate?”

“Oh, don’t pretend you forgot! Your divorce is finally finalized! No more Damon. That man was a burden, and I’m relieved you’ve come to your senses.”

Serena’s grip tightened on the phone. She hated Damon with everything inside her.

“And,” her mother added, “Michael has arranged something special for you. He booked a table at Luxea Restaurant—the best restaurant in the city. It’s exclusive, Serena. You should feel honored.”

Michael.

Serena’s eyes immediately lit up at the name. What else could make her happier? Michael was the only man who could lift her to the top with just a tip of his finger. With a single word from him, she had secured a partnership with Vespera Corporation.

“Michael wanted to celebrate with you for securing the partnership with Vespera Corporation. Even though he's the one who helped you, he’s so kind, Serena,” her mother said excitedly. Serena couldn’t keep the smile off her face.

“I know, Mom. You made me make the right choice,” Serena said, practically jumping with happiness.

“You almost declined Michael because of that trash! I’m so glad you changed your mind. Look where Michael has taken you—to the top, my dear. I’m glad I convinced you.”

“Thank you so much, Mom. You’re the best.”

“Now, you don’t want to be late. Get dressed and come to Luxea Restaurant. We can’t keep Michael waiting! A man like him should never be kept waiting—he’s our god now, Serena. Quickly, get dressed.”

“Okay, Mom. I’ll be there before you even know it,” Serena said.

“Wear something seductive and stunning. You should look stunning tonight, Serena.” her mother added.

“Okay, Mom, I get it. Bye. I should quickly get dressed,” Serena said, ending the call. The happiest look spread across her face as she pushed aside the thought of the ring and excitedly rushed inside to get ready.

---

Cars stopped near Luxea Restaurant, and in the second car, a guard quickly stepped out to open the door of the first car.

Damon stepped out.

He didn’t spare the scenery a glance—his mind was on one thing: what Simon had uncovered about his mother’s death.

He headed toward the restaurant, his guards instinctively falling in behind him.

""Wait outside. I’ll go in alone,"" Damon ordered.

The guards stopped at his word, and Damon continued on toward the grand entrance. But just as he reached the doors, a security guard stepped forward, blocking his path.

“Membership card?” the guard asked flatly.

His eyes ran over Damon’s appearance—simple clothes, no flashy accessories. Nothing that screamed “VIP.” The guard’s lips curled slightly in disdain.

Damon arched a brow. “I don’t have one.”

He had dined here before with Anthony—no one had ever mentioned a membership card then.

The guard's stance stiffened. His tone turned dismissive, almost scornful. “This place is for members only. No card, no entry. Now move along.”

His gaze was sharp, judgmental—as if Damon were some vagrant trying to sneak into a palace.

Damon’s expression remained unreadable, but the air around him shifted. Cooler. Sharper.

“I’m invited by—”

Before he could finish, a mocking voice rang out behind him.

“Oh, look who we have here—my ex-useless son-in-law!”

Damon turned immediately, smirking. Tessa, Serena’s mother, stood there, looking smug.

She was here too. Not that it mattered to Damon.

Tessa approached, her eyes gleaming with malice.

""What is a useless man like you doing in a place like this? Are you trying to sneak your miserable self inside? Trying to scam your way in, pretending to be a wealthy man? It’s called theft, Damon. You still haven’t changed. You’re a thief!"" she yelled loudly, drawing attention from people.

But Damon just stared at the foolish woman in front of him.

Like mother, like daughter.

Tessa eyed him up and down and smirked. “You know what? My future son-in-law—the only man worthy of my daughter—is a platinum member of this restaurant. He doesn’t have to fake his way in.”

She let out a mocking laugh as the murmurs and chuckles of the crowd surrounded them.

Chapter four:

Damon stood still, his sharp eyes locked onto Tessa. She smirked in satisfaction, her gaze filled with arrogance. Around them, whispers floated through the air.

But Damon wasn’t interested in giving Tessa the reaction she wanted. He had no intention of arguing with her. He simply reached into his pocket, pulled out his phone, and dialed a number.

The call barely rang before a voice answered.

“Hello, Boss?” Anthony’s voice carried a hint of surprise as if he hadn’t expected a call from Damon at this moment.

Damon’s tone was cold. “ I’m outside Luxea. But the staff seem to think I'm not qualified to enter.“

There was a brief pause. Then Anthony’s voice came back, now laced with panic. “Who dared to stop you! I’ll handle it immediately!”

Before Damon could respond, Tessa let out a loud, exaggerated laugh.

Heads turned. The sound of her laughter echoed, drawing more attention to the scene.

“Oh, are you calling for help, Damon?” she mocked, crossing her arms as she shook her head. “Are you pretending to be important again? You think making fake calls will change anything? You’re just a worthless man, a gold digger, a parasite! I should expose you for who you really are.”

She took a step closer, her voice dripping with disdain. “My daughter fed you, clothed you, and took care of you for years while you brought nothing to the table. And what did you do in return? Nothing! You’re still the same useless man, pretending to be someone important.”

The security guards, hearing Tessa’s words, exchanged glances. They straightened their postures, now fully convinced that Damon was just another desperate man trying to sneak his way into a place meant for the elite.

One of the guards stepped forward, his expression blank but firm. “Sir, if you don’t leave now, we’ll have to chase you out.”

Damon didn’t react. He simply exhaled slowly and slid his phone back into his pocket. His face remained unreadable.

“Touch me,” he said, his voice dangerously low, “and you’ll regret it.”

The guards hesitated. There was something about the way he spoke—calm, yet commanding—that made them uneasy.

Tessa, however, wasn’t fazed. She rolled her eyes and gestured impatiently. “Throw him out! He's a useless poor man!”

The guards moved.

But just as they reached for him, a sharp voice rang out from the entrance.

“Stop! What are you doing?!”

The sudden command froze everyone in place.

A man in a crisp black suit rushed out of the restaurant. His forehead was lined with stress, his breathing uneven as if he had run all the way. The golden name tag on his chest read Manager Vincent.

The moment he spotted Damon, his face turned pale.

He hurried forward, his voice filled with urgency. “Mr. Damon! I sincerely apologize for this offense!”

Tessa’s smirk faded.

The guards glanced at each other in confusion.

Damon remained still, his gaze unreadable.

Vincent turned sharply to the security guards. His face darkened with anger. “Do you know who this is? Who gave you permission to treat a guest this way?”

The lead guard hesitated, glancing at Tessa for direction. “We were told—”

“You were told?” Vincent snapped, cutting him off. “And you just blindly followed orders without verifying? If Mr. Damon was truly insulted by this treatment, you’d all be out of a job right now!”

The guards stiffened. The color drained from their faces.

Damon remained silent, watching the scene unfold with mild amusement.

Vincent turned back to him and gave a small bow. “Sir, please allow me to personally escort you inside. This will never happen again.”

Tessa’s face twisted with anger.

“Wait, what?!” she burst out, stepping forward. “You’re letting him in? That’s ridiculous! I know this man! He’s my ex-son-in-law! He’s a nobody! He doesn’t belong here!”

Vincent remained composed, his expression unreadable. “That is irrelevant, ma’am. This is about Mr. Damon.”

Tessa scoffed, raising her voice. “Do you even know who my future son-in-law is? Michael is a platinum member here! If anyone should get special treatment, it’s us! I demand you remove him immediately!”

Vincent’s eyes darkened.

His voice was cold as he turned to the guards. “Do not let her enter anymore.”

Tessa gasped. “You—You can’t do that!”

Vincent remained unfazed. “And Ma’am… I suggest you lower your voice. If you continue causing a scene, we will have no choice but to revoke your son-in-law’s membership.”

Tessa froze.

For the first time that evening, real fear flickered across her face.

Around them, onlookers whispered among themselves. Some chuckled quietly, enjoying the spectacle of a woman who had been so loud moments ago now silenced.

Damon finally adjusted his cuffs and spoke for the first time since Vincent arrived.

“Seems like you underestimated me again, Tessa.”

Tessa clenched her fists. Her nails dug into her palms as she swallowed back the rage burning in her chest.

“This isn't right, he's a nobody,” she hissed under her breath.

Ignoring her, Vincent stepped aside and gestured toward the entrance. “Please, Mr. Damon, allow me to lead the way.”

Damon smirked slightly before stepping past Tessa without a second glance.

Tessa stood frozen in place, unable to move or speak, as if she were trapped in a dream. But she knew all too well—this wasn’t a dream. It was real.

The murmurs of the crowd surrounded her and laughing at her.

And she hated it.

The guards stood still, not moving, refusing to let her in. She paced back and forth, her heels clicking against the pavement.

Gritting her teeth, she took out her phone and dialed Serena’s number.

“Serena, I can’t believe this!” Tessa’s voice was sharp, cutting through the silence outside the restaurant.

Her face was red with anger, her hands waving as she spoke into her phone.

Serena’s voice came through the phone, finding it hard to believe what she just heard. “Mom, calm down. What exactly happened?”

“That useless man—Damon—got inside! Can you believe it? After everything I said, after I told them the truth about who he really is, they still let him in! But me? I’m stuck out here like some nobody!”

Serena’s eyes widened. “Are you sure, Mom? Damon is really here?”

Chapter five:

“Yes, Serena! Why would I lie? Do something now!Talk to Michael. Tell him to talk to the manager. I’m not standing out here like some beggar! This is humiliating! My future son-in-law is a platinum member of this restaurant—I have every right to be inside!” Tessa shouted.

“Mom, I’ll tell him right away. We’ll get you inside, and they’ll regret treating you like this. Just wait a few minutes,” Serena said before ending the call, her voice filled with anger.

She slammed her glass down, startling Michael, who sat across from her. “Damon followed me here. I knew it. That leech doesn’t know when to give up! And my mother is stuck outside now because of him. God knows what trick he used!”

Michael raised a brow, his voice calm but laced with arrogance. “Don’t worry. The manager here, Vincent, is a friend. I’ll get your mother in. And that trash? We’ll deal with him later.”

Serena felt a small spark of satisfaction. Michael won’t let this go. They’ll regret it.

Michael pulled out his phone with practiced confidence and dialed.

The line connected.

“Michael, this better not be about that woman outside,” Vincent’s voice snapped through the speaker, sharp and unamused.

Michael blinked. “It is. That’s my fiancée’s mother. Just let her in—”

“She’s making a scene. And frankly, I’m already regretting letting you in tonight,” Vincent growled. “Do you even know who’s here?”

Michael frowned. “Some VIP, I assume?”

“Not just any VIP,” Vincent hissed. “Simon Scott and the CEO of Vespera Corporation are hosting someone even more important upstairs. I’m not risking that guest’s experience over your girlfriend’s mother!”

“One more outburst from her, not only will she be banned, you and your little girlfriend are out too. Permanently.”

The call cut.

Michael stared at his phone for a beat, his face stormy.

Simon Scott was not just anyone. He was the president of the city's largest chamber of commerce, and the right-hand man of one of the most influential figures in the business world. And the CEO of Vespera Corporation? That was a man who held the power to make or break careers.

They were someone he could not afford to offend. And here he was, dragged into unnecessary trouble because of Serena’s mother’s arrogance!

He turned sharply to Serena. “Tell your mother to go home. Now.”

Serena’s brows furrowed. “What? Michael, she’ll lose it—”

“If she doesn’t leave, we’re getting kicked out too. The CEO of Vespera Corporation is here. And someone even more powerful than him. Do you want to lose your deal?”

Serena hesitated, her nails digging into her palm. “No… of course not.”

“Then make the call.”

She nodded stiffly and pressed dial.

“Mom,” she said as soon as the line picked up, her voice low and tight. “You need to leave. Now.”

“What?! Serena, are you out of your mind?!”

“If you don’t go now, Michael’s membership will be revoked. The manager’s furious. There are important people here—people who could end my partnership with Vespera.”

Tessa gasped. “That’s not my problem—”

“If you don’t leave now,” Serena snapped, “don’t bother calling me again. You’ve embarrassed me enough.”

Silence.

Then a bitter huff. “Fine. But you owe me this.”

The call ended.

Serena dropped the phone onto the table, exhaling slowly.

“She’s gone,” she muttered.

Michael nodded, tension easing slightly. “Good.”

They sat in silence for a moment before curiosity crept back into Serena’s voice.

“Who do you think the third guest is?”

Michael’s eyes gleamed. “Someone big. If the CEO of Vespera and Simon Scott are acting like assistants tonight, that person must have real power.”

Serena’s gaze turned thoughtful. “If we could just meet him…”

Michael smirked. “If we play it right tonight, maybe we will.”

Serena’s eyes narrowed. “And meanwhile, that trash Damon just walks in like a king.”

Michael chuckled. “Forget him. He’s nothing. But that VIP? That’s someone worth chasing.”

Meanwhile, at the top floor of the restaurant.

“Where is Boss? Are they still making him wait?” Anthony’s voice was low as he glanced at the elevator. He paced the room, his fists clenched, barely holding back his frustration.

Simon sat calmly at the table, his fingers pressed together, looking thoughtful. “Relax, Anthony. He’ll be here soon. I’m sure the manager has taken care of it.”

“Relax?” Anthony snapped, turning to Simon. “Boss isn’t the kind of man who likes to be kept waiting or made angry.”

Simon raised an eyebrow, still calm. “If they were making him wait and upsetting him, he would have called you again by now.”

Anthony glared at him but said nothing. He just kept pacing, fear clear in every step.

The elevator dinged softly, and both men turned as the doors slid open. Damon stepped out, his presence filling the room. His face was calm, but there was a sharpness in his eyes that made Anthony stand up straight immediately.

“Boss,” Anthony said with a slight bow, his voice tight with relief. “You’re here.”

Chapter six:

Damon nodded, his gaze sweeping the room before landing on Simon. “Simon,” he said, his voice calm but full of authority. “I hope you have something worth my time.”

Simon stood with a faint smile on his lips. “Always a pleasure. Please, sit. I've gathered new information about your mother's death.It's not much, but it's... significant.”

Damon walked to the table, his movements slow and controlled. He sat down, his sharp eyes locked on Simon. “Talk.”

Simon leaned in, speaking quietly. “ Two days before the accident happened to your mom, she got a call from someone flagged in a database—an ex-military guy with ties to a security firm. The call was erased from her phone records, but I managed to get a trace from the telecom company.”

Damon’s hands clenched on the table. “Who did this?”

“I don’t have a name yet, but it leads to a fake company—Tarnex Holdings. It’s a cover, and it’s linked to someone powerful enough to hide everything.”

Damon’s voice turned cold. “I want everything. Every name, every connection, every detail. No more pieces. I want the whole truth.”

Simon nodded. “I’m working on it. But whoever did this isn’t just rich. They have power. Influence and legal. The kind of power that quietly gets rid of people.”

Damon’s lips curled into a dangerous smile. ""Regardless of how powerful they are, I'll uncover who’s behind this.""

The room fell silent, Damon’s words hanging heavy in the air. Anthony stood by the window, arms crossed, his expression tense. He knew better than to interrupt, but the tension in the room was thick.

After they finished their meal, Damon stood up, moving smoothly. “Keep me updated, Simon. I expect results.”

Simon nodded seriously. “You’ll get them.”

Damon turned and walked toward the elevator. Anthony followed quickly, but before he could step in, Damon stopped him.

“I’ll leave first,” Damon said and entered the elevator.

The ride down was silent. When the doors opened, Damon stepped out, but to his surprise, Serena and Michael were standing near the entrance.

“Damon?!”

The voice was sharp, full of disbelief. Damon's face was calm as he met Serena’s gaze. She stood a few feet away, arms crossed, eyes narrowed.

“What are you doing here?” she demanded, suspicion in her voice.

Damon raised an eyebrow, his tone calm but dismissive. “Eating. What else?”

Serena’s eyes narrowed more, her disbelief turning to anger. “Don’t lie to me, Damon. You’re not here to eat. You’re following me, aren’t you?”

Damon smirked, his voice mocking. “Following you? Don’t flatter yourself, Serena. I have better things to do.”

Serena’s face turned red with anger, her fists clenching. “You’re such a liar. You don’t even belong here. How did you get in? Did you sneak in? Or did you beg someone to let you in?”

Damon’s face stayed calm, but there was amusement in his eyes. “Believe what you want, Serena. It doesn’t change the fact that I’m here.”

Serena scoffed, her voice full of disdain. “Please. You’re not fooling anyone. You’re probably only allowed to stay in the lobby. You don’t even have the right to go upstairs.”

Damon’s smirk widened, his tone mocking. “And you do?”

Serena’s eyes flashed with anger, her voice rising. “Of course I do. Michael has a platinum card. We’re dining on the third floor. “

She scoffed, crossing her arms arrogantly, “ And you know what? The CEO of Vespera Corporation and Simon Scott, the president of the city’s business association, are dining on the top floor, entertaining a distinguished guest. Only people of our status can eat in the same restaurant with those important people. And you? You aren’t even qualified to clean the toilets here.”

Damon’s smile turned cold, his eyes sharp. “Is that so?”

Serena smirked, looking smug. “Yes, it is. So stop pretending to be something you’re not. You’re just a worthless man who doesn’t belong here.”

Michael had been smiling the whole time, watching Damon with disgust and amusement as Serena mocked him.

Then—

Damon laughed.

It was a low, quiet chuckle, one that sent a chill down their spines before they could even process why.

Michael’s smirk faltered. ""What’s so funny?""

Damon’s gaze sharpened, the amusement in his eyes cutting like a blade.

""That ‘distinguished guest’ they were entertaining?""

He took a step forward, lowering his voice slightly.

""That was me.""
