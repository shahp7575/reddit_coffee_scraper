The wind was whistling through the exterior corridor, carrying with it the gentle rustling of tree branches from the forest stretching behind the motel. The lights hanging at the ends of the hallway were dangling mindlessly, barely making any difference in the quickly decaying daylight. Harris was bent over the railing, staring blankly at the road ahead. He didn't even bother to look at the cars that passed every once in a while, just letting the cold breeze smoke the cigarette between his fingers. After his small fit, him and the Sheriff tried to collect every piece of information that seemed useful from that wretched house. After walking around the lower level for a while, dusting the place for fingerprints and picking up small objects to be sent to the Morgantown PD lab, they gathered their courage to go upstairs. They broke every rule in the book and Harris knew that. But he also started to feel like no one actually cared for it except himself. After witnessing the bloodbath in the kitchen, he felt like he started feeling more at ease for whatever this case could throw at him. And he would have done anything to not have to see that scene anymore.

Luckily, the upstairs looked more normal, judging the circumstances. No red stains or... pieces, that is. Besides the mostly non-existing roof, and the wood poles that lay broken on the bathroom and bedroom floors, the place looked remarkably intact. In the coat that was still hanging to the closet knob in the bedroom he found Dean McConnell's wallet, with ID and money still inside. He also found the small safe tucked away behind the large wood desk, which was untouched. After putting the desk back in its place, Harris checked the leather-bound notebooks that were laying on it. One of them was full of recipes, one contained small mementos, phone numbers of close relatives, passwords and what-not. The third one wouldn't have caught the Deputy's attention normally. After hastily checking a couple of pages, he noticed the tone of the writing was very mundane, and at times the handwriting was barely legible, as if McConnell was talking to himself. Most probably a diary, Harris thought to himself. He then noticed the timestamps. Recent timestamps. The latest entry was on January 29th, which Pineville S.D. estimated as the date the murder happened.

Harris winced when he felt the sudden burning sensation in his fingers. The light in his cigarette was already way past the filter line. He rubbed the butt on the corridor railing and threw it in the standing ashtray beside him, and went inside his room. He took a long look at the state of the place. The rancid, moldy stains on the ceiling, the translucent windows not made so by design, but lack of care, the carpet that he suspected was older than him, and the bedsheets that embodied the very essence of beige. He looked at the notebook on the small metal table by the window. While the rest of the evidence was now probably in the Sheriff's office, Harris insisted he take the diary for further inspection. He checked his wristwatch: too late to phone his wife. And he knew that sleep was a distant wish that couldn't be fulfilled. Not tonight. Not after what he saw. So he sat down at the metal table, and opened the notebook.



January 22nd

Finally, I'm here. Drive to the cabin felt endless, especially once I crossed the county line. Who would have thought there would be so much traffic going to West Virginia in the middle of winter? I appreciate the care that we always had when leaving the cabin, though. Every time we came back everything was in order. I hate the feeling of entering a house that remained unoccupied for longer periods of time. Things tend to be out of order, as if the mere absence of people dirties the place.

As suggested by doctor Rodriguez, I am writing this journal as a way to unload my thoughts and emotions. She suggested that I come here for a few days, write everything that goes through my mind. Or what goes through OUR mind. She didn't specify whether I should address these messages to myself, or imagine that I am talking to someone else. I'll just see where this leads.

Come to think of it, this might be part of the exercise. Maybe writing it the way I feel in the moment and addressing it much the same will help ease these feelings. Anyway, I am pretty tired now, it's been a long day. I'll go fix up the gas tank under the stove and get something going. Bought some essentials down at the grocery store on Main Street, and I'm feeling steak with green peppercorn sauce for tonight. Probably going to go straight to bed afterwards. So bye, journal, I guess?



January 23rd

03:12 AM

I can't fall asleep. I tried to force myself, and even though I feel like my eyes are going to melt away, I can't actually push myself over the edge. I just rolled around in bed for a few hours, struggling between freezing outside of the blanket and sweating profusely under it. I should have brought my laptop, even though doctor Rodriguez convinced me otherwise. She said it would distract me, cloud my thoughts. Cabin never had a TV, at least as far as I know, and only brought one book with me. Not a very good choice, tried reading a few pages, but it doesn't seem my style. So I guess writing is my escapism this night. Decided it might be better to write down the time for each entry in the journal. That way I can keep track of my thoughts. Doc said to let myself flow over the pages. She said to write about day-to-day life, but most importantly to write about what I feel deep down. About what bothers me, what hurts. But it's hard to do it. Never really opened up about these things to anyone. Baby steps, Dean, baby steps.

Tomorrow I'm planning to do some setup around the house. Or today, rather, I forget what time it is. I should unpack my bags, sort out the boiler for the hot water, bring out the wooly blankets from the storage room, setup the kitchen. Planning on improving some recipes that I've been working on for a while. I hope I can add that duck confit with blackcurrant reduction and cedar-infused rosemary to the menu when I get back to the city. But that's a problem for tomorrow. Or today. I'll try to go back to bed.

04:47 AM

I keep thinking about her. I miss her, so much. I know that's normal, but I just can't really accept it. I know it happened, but I don't want that. I don't want it to be true. I just wish I could pinch myself and wake up from this nightmare. I would even try to go to sleep with the hope that through some weird dream logic I could get back to the real world. To wake up next to her, watch her sleep peacefully next to me, like I've watched her so many times before. I don't know how to express it, it just feels like this huge pressure in my chest, and whatever I do, it just doesn't go away. I go to the restaurant and drown myself in work, trying as much as possible to avoid going back home. I stopped video calling my mom because of the fear of seeing her look at me with those sorrowful eyes. I just wait for her to check up on me, and I am tired of hearing the pity in her voice when she asks me how I'm feeling, knowing fully well how I'm feeling. I go shopping for ingredients and try to smile back to the cashiers, but it just doesn't work. I know this might seem like the weirdest thing to pinpoint, but it feels so weird right now. It is such a natural thing, smiling. Pretending to be happy, to be content. I feel like I can't even pretend anymore.

I never would have believed I would end up here. Even when the doctors told us the diagnosis, I couldn't even imagine. In my head, the plan was simple. Lots of TLC. She would take the sick leave, I can support the both of us. A bunch of procedures, X-rays and what-not, until the chemo started. Even when it was close to the end, and I was standing on the edge of that hospital bed, holding her feeble hand, watching the color drift from her face over the days. I still had all the hope in the world, because even in those moments she would smile, tell me that she is feeling somewhat better, and that she loves me. She always was the more optimistic of the two of us. She was weak, yes, but didn't it work like that? The treatment attacks the tumor, but it also attacks the rest of the body. And then everything will be fine. Right? When it finally happened, I wasn't even fully aware of it. The doctor warned me that the treatment wasn't really working to plan, and that the disease was most likely spreading again. But during the day-to-day trips she seemed... okay. She was moving more, talking more. She wasn't eating, she said the chemo was killing her appetite. She tried having a few mouthfuls of the food I brought with me from the restaurant. She said she could never pass on my ragu. I couldn't, or wouldn't, recognize the light that was slowly fading from her eyes as the weeks dragged on. In the very end, I think she just let go. Gave up. Whenever I close my eyes at night, I picture her in that final moment. Her green eyes, so full of joy and candor, now turned dull. Her face thinner, her almost transparent skin wrapped tightly around her cheeks. She pressed on my hand to tell me to get closer. She could barely even whisper. I still don't know what those few last words said, before she closed her eyes.

08:03 PM

Cooked the duck. Still not there yet, sauce is too sweet, needs more acidity. Shouldn't put lemon though, maybe I can try a bit of balsamic. As you can see, I didn't really have time for writing today. Or, as I can see. Still not sure how to address this. Did a bunch of stuff around the house, and after I was done with the prep work for the recipe I really felt like having a break. Went for a walk down the holler, almost reached the old Company Store before it started getting dark. Got back up the moment I saw the light dimming. No electrical lighting on the holler, and I don't really want to take the chances of getting face-to-face with a wolf.

Last night I fell asleep writing, basically passed out. Woke up around 11:00 AM, feeling even more tired. But I couldn't sleep anymore, my back was hurting again.

I found the old radio while looking through the living room cupboards, I completely forgot about this. It was nice having something to listen to while cooking, even if there are only two stations available and one of them is mostly static. Hopefully it will help me feel less lonely these days.

I should probably head to bed now, it's been a long day, and I feel like I will have more luck with the sleep tonight.



January 24th

09:00 AM

Was right about the sleep. Most restful night I've had in the past few months. Found a half-full bottle of maple syrup while looking for the coffee pot. Going to whip up some pancake batter and fry some bacon in its honor.

03:24 PM

Just got back from town. Had to pick up a few things for the carbonara tonight. Pineville isn't really known for its guanciale, but I guess some garlic cured ham will do. No Italians around here to judge. Also met Otis, the Deputy. He told me there was a blizzard warning, supposedly it will hit tonight. He asked if I wanted to get a room at the motel, on the house, but it's more comfortable here. After the talk with him, I went back to the grocery store to double down on the food and household supplies. Now I have enough toilet paper and batteries to last a full winter.

10:47 PM

Well, Otis was right about the blizzard. It's hailing ass outside, and the wind beating against the side of the house is almost deafening when staying in the kitchen. It's weirdly calm, though. The whirring and beating sounds help muffle my thoughts. I'll do some reading before going to bed.



January 25th

06:22 AM

Just got done talking to Otis, he wanted to see if I was ok. Called the police last night, something weird happened. Most probably some punk kids snuck around the cabin, trying to scare me. I was downstairs in the kitchen. Even though the blizzard is still ongoing, there was a timeframe of about one hour when the wind was more gentle, and I could see the thick snowflakes landing more peacefully in the total darkness outside. At some point, I heard some ruffling outside. I turned off the radio and got up, put my ear against the wall, pretty close to the front door. I didn't hear anything for a few moments, but then it came again. I was pretty sure it sounded like footsteps.

I peeked through the curtains of the kitchen window, but couldn't see anything. I waited a couple of minutes, but couldn't hear anything else, so I turned the radio on again, went back to the crossword puzzle I had laying on the table. It's quite weird when you are focused on something, and then you pull back from it, even for a split-second, you realize that some things you were internalizing as being part of your own mind are coming from outside. That's what happened to me after I looked up from the puzzle, considering if I should pour a glass of wine. I realized that a specific rhythmical beat that I was hearing was not coming from the song on the radio. There was beating on the cabin's wall. \*Bang\* and then a moment of silence, followed by another \*bang\*. It was the sound of something small, but hard, hitting wood. I turned the radio down. The sound came again.

\*bang\* pause \*bang\*

\*bang\* pause \*bang\*

These mountains are full of wolves, bears, deer and other game meat. But they don't usually venture close to towns, even the more isolated hollers, like this one. Never heard of a bear beating on a house trying to get in around here. And they for sure cannot maintain a rhythm like this. There was a person outside of my house.

I listened for a few more seconds. I didn't turn off the radio, I didn't want to let the intruder know I was aware of their presence. And I realized the beating was now coming from the kitchen wall, and was slowly making its way towards the front of the house. As it turned the corner, the beating picked up the pace, just a bit. Just barely perceptible. There was a \*bang\* every few inches along the wall, and I was following it, pacing carefully to not let the floorboards creak beneath me. The moment the beating reached the window to the left of the front door, it took a brief pause before resuming on its other side. What I thought was weird in that moment, what I still think is weird, is that I couldn't see any shape or shadow in that moment. The curtains here are pretty thin, and normally you would be able to see the shape of another person walking outside, even at night.

\*bang\*

The door resounded.

\*bang\*

I could feel a slight increase to the force of the knock.

\*bang\*

I walked up to the door and carefully lifted the visor. I couldn't see anything, too dark. I should have left the porch light on. Or maybe the person knocking was crouched beneath the visor.

\*bang\*

I could feel the force of the knock at the height of my chest. Without realizing it, I knocked back.

There was a pause, and then it came.

\*bang\*

I hit again.

\*bang\*

\*bang\*

I knocked harder.

\*bang bang bang\*

\*bang bang bang\*

I thought the guy must be mocking me. I yelled ""Hey! Stop that!"".

The knocking stopped. I put my ear against the door. I waited for what felt like a good few minutes. And then

""Hey!""

The voice on the other side was quite high. Sounded clean, but somehow unsure. ""Who are you?"" I asked.

""Hey!"" it sounded a bit deeper, a bit more raspy than before. ""What do you mean hey? I asked who are you!"" I yelled back. ""Hey! Hey! Hey!"" I could hear the three words coming from different sides of the door. There wasn't just one guy.

""Get out of here, before I call the police!""

""Stop that!"" said one of the voices.

""Hey! Get out of here!"" said another.

Those guys must have been crazy or something. There was a barrage of sounds coming from the other side of the door, and the knocks resumed, now even more intense. I could barely hear Sheriff Waylon's voice on the other side of the phone while I asked for a house call. My mind was filled with those voices.

Hey! \*bang\* Get out of here! Hey! Stop! Get out of here! Police! \*bang\* Stop that! Hey! \*bang\* Get out of that! Call the police! I call! Stop! \*bang\* Hey! Get here! Out! \*bang\* Call the police! \*bang\* Hey! Hey! Hey!

The voices stopped soon after I finished the call. I ran upstairs and took the gun from the safe. Locked myself in the bedroom, and hid behind the desk, gun ready. At times, I could hear some sounds outside. What must have been footsteps, followed by the occasional ""Hey!"". What really shook me, however, was that they sounded remarkably similar to my voice now. Not the way you hear your voice in your own head, but the way you hear it on a recording somewhere, and you get disappointed because it never sounds the way you think it sounds, the way you want it to sound.   

Hey! Hey! Hey!

\*bang bang bang bang bang\*

The hard knocks woke me up from the trance I slipped myself into. They sounded tougher, more determined than even the ones before.

""Hey! Dean, you in there?""

I opened the bedroom door and crept down the stairs, looking around the house for any intruders.

""Dean! It's Otis Bailey from the Sheriff's Department! Are you in there?""

I could see the red-blue flashes of a police car peering through the curtains. Looked through the visor on the front door to see the figure of Otis standing on the other side.

Those intruders left before Otis got here, at least from what he told me. He took a good look around the house before knocking on my door. He saw some footprints around the house, which he showed me. There were indeed multiple sets of indents in the snow, circling the house back and forth, but the blizzard started picking up, and the wind was starting to cover the prints with snow. However, Otis pointed out that there was at least one set of prints leading away from the house, up the holler towards the old mine. Told him everything that happened. He assured me it must have been some kids, trying to prank me. I asked how can there be kids out in this kind of weather. He just shrugged. He asked again whether I want to go to the motel in town, but I refused. Apparently the blizzard will keep going for another few days.

Anyways, I'm pretty tired now, and could really go for some food. I'll get started on some breakfast.

12:15 PM

I hate this snow. It's been snowing non-stop for the past couple of hours. It's so cold that I can't even ventilate the place properly. I can only open the windows for a couple of minutes at a time before feeling like I'm freezing. It's especially bad after I cook, and I'm trying to get the smell out of the kitchen and living room. Kate asked me to fix the vent hood last year, when we noticed it wasn't pulling it's weight while frying some sausages. Should have done it then. No way I can fix it now.

02:34 PM

I'm starting to get really bored in here. Maybe I should have taken Otis' offer of driving me to the motel. At least I would be closer to everything else. At least I would get to go to a shop to see some people. It's very lonely being by yourself in the heart of the mountains here. Guess I never noticed it. I always came here with Kate, and it was the perfect getaway after months of work and busy schedules. We could come here, just the two of us, as a sort of romantic escape. No people, no responsibilities, just us.

11:17 PM

I spent the last few hours finishing the book I took here with me. Bought it a couple of years ago, when I went to a bookstore in Chicago with Kate. She told me it was her favorite book. I've never been much into horror myself. Read some Lovecraft and King in my sophomore year in high school, my friends were really into slasher movies and the likes. This one was really nice, though, especially the second half. I guess I like cosmic horror more than I thought. I predict that I'll have the image of an old, scrappy-looking wizard trying to fish out a leviathan out of a creek etched into my mind for a long time.

Had quite a lot of wine for dinner, I think I'm going to call it a night.



January 26th

04:15 AM

I just saw Kate in the house.

Of course, I didn't actually see her. It's just that I had the most vivid dream ever. I woke up to get a glass of water from the bathroom, and when I opened the bedroom door I saw her, standing there in the darkness of the corridor, her back towards me. I could see her figure pretty well in the silver moonlight protruding from the window. Her hair was tied in a loose bun, as she usually wore it around the house, and I could see she was wearing the earrings I got her for our first anniversary. She refused to wear any other ones. She said it helped her hear our hearts beating even when we were apart. She always was good with words, had a way of making my heart melt with every compliment.

I could see her hands moving by her side. She was slowly flexing and relaxing her fingers, as if her palms fell asleep. She was testing every finger, going back and forth between them. In that dreamy haze, I called out to her. ""Hey..."" that's all I could think of. I never dreamt of her after what happened. I guess it was a way for my brain to give me a bit of peace, at least while I was sleeping. I could see Kate stiffing her neck, but otherwise didn't move. A few moments later, I heard her respond in my own voice ""Hey!"". Next thing I know, she darted down the corridor into the small storage space next to the bathroom. At the same time, I drunkenly limped back into the bedroom and fell into the bed. At the same time, I woke up, sweating, heart pounding. I just started calming down. Don't think I can fall back asleep though.

08:32 AM

Indeed, couldn't fall asleep again. Still thinking about the dream I had. I guess I didn't want to let the rest of a night's sleep wash away the memory. Despite the almost disturbing setup of the dream, I am happy I can dream of her again. I spent the last few hours thinking of her, of us. Too much to put onto paper. I remember, during one of the first therapy sessions with doctor Rodriguez, she asked me if I could pick one memory of Kate that I loved the most. At that time, I told the doc that I couldn't possibly pick just one memory, that I would take any memory with her, be it good or bad, if that meant I could experience it with her.

Now, I think I finally chose a memory. When we were still quite young, when we had just moved from being friends to a full-on relationship, Kate invited me over to watch a movie at her place. We both laid down on the bed, blankets and stuffed animals all around us. We were stuffed from the homemade burgers we had cooked together. We flipped over the channels, until we landed on an Italian movie. At least as far as I remember, it was Italian. The movie depicted a first date between two people. The intriguing part, though, was that besides the date itself, the movie also showed the dialogues between each person's internal voices, as they were making decisions, thinking about the other person, and so on. The movie was pretty good, and we laughed a lot. I spilled red wine on Kate's bed, and I still hope she forgives me for that, but all-in-all we had a really good time. Even though the movie was a decent comedy, the discussion slipped into a somber analysis of the concept and inner workings of relationships. At that time, Kate was quite a bit more pessimistic than me. Stressful times, being a college student. But I still remember, clear as day, as she looked up at me and said ""It's sad when you think about it. Us, people, being so different from each-other, we are basically incompatible."" After I asked why is that, she said ""Because think about it: people are such evil creatures at their core. If relationships were such a natural thing, then why do you see so much abuse, so many broken marriages, so much suffering all around?"" I think I responded something among the lines of ""Because we are social creatures, and we need one another in the end.""

I kept thinking about that moment every now and then. I think about the certainty of human despise and the uncertainty on the world that reflected in her eyes at that time. And then I think about all the good times we had. I think about every joke that ever made her laugh. About all the places we've been to, and the curiosity and fascination she showed experiencing new cultures together. All the late-night talks about nothing and everything at the same time. All the times we cooked together, dancing to the music in the radio while flipping pans and mixing ingredients. All the times we hanged out with friends, and the knowing looks we gave each-other when we noticed something funny. All the silent moments, with her in my arms, slowly drifting to sleep. And I hope that I helped change her mind. I hope that I made her happy.

11:57 PM

Those damn pranksters came back again. They're knocking on the windows and the door. I think they recorded my voice the other night, they keep yelling in what sounds like my voice. Currently I locked myself in the bedroom, waiting to see if they go away.

11:57 PM

They keep at it. I'm gonna call the police.

11:57 PM

Fucking hell, the phone line must be messed up. Called a few times. The call went through only once, and I could barely distinguish what the dispatch guy was saying.

11:57 PM

This can't be happening!!! This can't be happening!!!

Relax, Dean, it will be fine. You have a gun, the door is locked and the police should be on their way. Any moment now.

11:57 PM

Shit, I think they broke in! I can hear footsteps in the house.

11:57 PM

What the fuck is going on? There is constant knocking on my door. It's too fast, I don't see how anyone could knock on a door that quick. After every burst of knocking, they are calling for me to come outside. It still sounds like my voice. Just what on Earth is happening?

11:57 PM

I can't do it anymore. They must have been going on for hours at this point. I hear rapid footsteps down the corridor, going to the bathroom. Then it comes back, just as fast, followed by bursts of knockings. After each knocking, the voice changes.

It drives me fucking nuts! How can it be?! At some point it sounded like Otis, but I know it can't be him. I would have heard his car come up the driveway, surely. Then it sounds like my mother, and doctor Rodriguez, and my friend Jeremy, and AND AND AND AND.

11:57 PM

I saw one out of the window. It got down on four legs and ran towards the house. It had a mocking imitation of clothing on, morphed to its skeletal body. It looked like a pitiful imitation of us. What the hell are these things? And why did it look like Otis?

11:57 PM

The knocking is getting so hard right now. I can hear them on the roof, trampling. They are trying to get in. They are trying to convince me to come outside. I don't think the cops are coming anymore. They are close to breaking the door down. They have Kate's voice.



January 27th

08:14 AM

Had some cereal this morning, about to head out to fix a leak in the roof, above the porch. It's been driving me crazy these past few nights.

19:03 PM

This day was productive, at least I'm happy about that. Still pretty boring out here. The snow completely covers the road up the holler. But at least the blizzard seems to be over. In a couple of days, I hope they can send the ploughs over here.



January 35th

01:06 AM

No updates, everything is fine at the cabin. Excited to go back into town!

15:89 AM

Must be really nice weather in New York now! I really miss Kate. Can't wait to see her again.

14:11 PM

I remember that time we used to go down to the creek. There was an old coal refinery down there. Remember when we would go down there? We were sitting on the edge of the water, skipping stones. You never were that skilled at it. But you liked seeing the miners work. Would you like to go there again?



January 29th

00:13 PM

Hey! It's Dean McConnell again. Sorry about that.

Everything is fine now. It's a bit warm in the house, a bit concerned for the state of the wood. But at least I got the radio back on. So many new things there. Such educational material. And such interesting voices.



5.

Deputy Harlan Harris leaned back in the creaky desk chair. He looked visibly tired. He read and re-read Dean's notebook since arriving at the Sheriff's Department. Sheriff Thompson was kind enough to provide him with a desk near the far end of the precinct, and Harris' back was hurting from sitting down so long. He got up and lit a cigarette, trying to piece together the information.

Dean sounded like he was in a lot of torment, and his handwriting slowly became more unclear as the pages progressed. He talked about someone harassing him, maybe pranking him, but the later entries point to something far more extreme. Dean thought he wasn't tormented by people by the end of it, he thought he was tormented by creatures. He also mentioned Otis Bailey, Sheriff Thompson's Deputy. He thought one of those creatures looked like Otis. Could it have been Otis? No one saw him since the ordeal, as far as the APB put out was concerned.

Harris thought Dean might have lost his mind halfway during his stay at the cabin, due to the loneliness and emotional turmoil he went through. But still, there must be a way to uncover the truth. He walked away from the desk, his boots hitting the marble floor. As he turned the corner, he saw a fleeting shape sliding into the Sheriff's office. Even though he only saw the person with the corner of his eye, Harris recognized the colors as that of Pineville S.D. A few moments later, as he was walking, he heard Sheriff Thompson's voice booming from his office.

This year? The shift is brutal. The ""Prestige"" buyers have vanished. The ""Sentiment"" buyers are out in force.

They trap food, make brushing hard, and can hurt your gums. [**Invisalign treatment**](https://thesmileclinic.uk.com/invisalign-clinic-in-colchester/) uses clear plastic trays to straighten teeth. No brackets. No wires. It is easy to live with and simple to clean.

Sounds interesting, isn’t it?

If yes, then let’s find out more about invisalign treatment.

# What Invisalign Feels Like

Metal braces can rub and poke. Invisalign trays are smooth and fit close to your teeth. A new tray feels tight for a day or two, then it feels normal.

Change to a new set at night so you sleep through the tightest hours. You can work, study, and talk as normal.

# How Your Day Looks

Eat, brush, trays back in. That’s it. Keep a small kit: toothbrush, toothpaste, and your tray case.

Eating out? Rinse and brush as soon as you can. Do not wrap trays in napkins—cafés may throw them away. Keep a spare case in your bag or car.

# Keeping Teeth And Trays Clean

Take trays out to eat. Brush and floss your teeth. Rinse trays with lukewarm water (not hot). Clean them with a soft brush or cleaner from your clinic.

This keeps your breath fresh and the trays clear. Avoid hot drinks with trays in because heat can bend the plastic.

# Food and Drink

Eat the foods you like. Apples, bread crusts, popcorn, nuts—fine. Just take trays out first. Water is okay with trays in.

For coffee or tea, take trays out, enjoy your drink, brush, and put them back in. With no brackets, you don’t worry about breaking anything while eating.

# Clear Plan You Can See

Most clinics start with a quick 3D scan. No messy putty. Your dentist shows how your teeth should move and about how long it will take.

You change trays every 7–14 days. Small tooth‑coloured “attachments” or elastic bands may help for harder moves. At the end, a few extra trays can polish the result.

# Fewer Visits to the Clinic

No wire tightenings. Check‑ups are short and spread out, often every 6–8 weeks. Some clinics let you send photos between visits.

Travelling? Carry your next set and your case. You spend less time in the chair.

# Health Benefits

Straighter teeth are easier to clean. You get less plaque, calmer gums, and fresher breath.

Fixing crowding or gaps spreads your bite more evenly and helps protect your teeth from wear. If your teeth moved after old braces, aligners can fix that too.

# Who Invisalign is For?

Invisalign works well for many mild to moderate problems:

* Crowding or spacing
* Small overbite, crossbite, or open bite

If tooth movement is very complex, braces may be better. If you know you won’t wear trays 20–22 hours a day, braces may suit you more. The best choice is the one you can follow.

# A Short Real Example

Amelia is 29. She changed trays on Sunday nights. Coffee first, trays in after. She kept a brush at her desk and a spare case in the car.

By week three, the tight feeling felt normal. By month two, the gap in her front teeth was half closed. No one at work noticed the trays unless she told them.

# What Results Look Like

You might see small changes in a few weeks. Photos often look better by month two or three.

Good habits make good results: wear trays 20–22 hours a day, push them in fully, and change on time.

# Sports, Music, and Travel

Gym and running are fine. For contact sports, take trays out and wear a mouthguard.

Wind and brass players usually adjust in a few days because there are no brackets rubbing.

Travelling? Pack your next set, your case, and a toothbrush.

# Speaking and the First Days

You might have a small lisp for a day or two. Read out loud for ten minutes to help.

New trays feel tight at first. If needed, take simple pain relief on day one. It eases quickly.

# Costs—What Changes The Price

Two things matter most:

* How complex your case is
* How long it takes

Shorter plans cost less. Longer plans cost more. A good clinic gives a written quote after your scan and explains what is included.Get more info [here](https://thesmileclinic.uk.com/top-benefits-of-invisalign-treatment-over-traditional-braces/).",1,1765628516.0,indianwriters,0,1.0,False

[https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1plfzba/an\_extensive\_guide\_to\_cat\_prep\_part\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CATpreparation/comments/1plfzba/an_extensive_guide_to_cat_prep_part_1/)

The first part of the post had Part 1 and 2 was about how you start building yourself up through the initial preparation, and initial mock analysis as you start taking mocks. The following part deals with the preparation post-August. 

**The reason for posting this early is to make sure that this reaches aspirants who are starting now.**

**Part 3: Strategy, Stamina and Errors**  
  
Around the beginning of August, you should be comfortable with a mock, and the syllabus overall. Comfortable is defined as “you know what cat syllabus entails, you know how a mock works, you can find your way around a CAT Mock.   
  
Now comes the hardest part. Building up speed, reducing errors, building stamina and a strategy to approach the mock.   
Let’s get to it.   
  
1. **Now it's time to learn to be flexible.** It's time to now be aware of HOW you attempt a mock. By that, I mean for example your VARC attempt style, whether you attempt one before the other, your DILR set selection and thoughts, and fallacies, and how you approach quants in terms of question choosing, moving on, etc.   
  
2. Before we get ahead, this is the point where you want to drop your ego if you have any for a particular section. Does not matter which topic you are good at, you can get better unless you are ranking top 10 consistently in a mock. Which nobody does.   
  
3. Start waking up by 7 am by now, a month ago before Admit, around early October. That is because if you get slot 1, you can quickly adjust to 6. If slot 3, you can just wake up at 9 am. This one month, you may have to suffer a bit depending on your sleep cycle and potential slot, but push as much as you can to build that habit. 

  
**Late mock strategies:**   
  
**Speed**  
  
The below should be executed once you’ve stagnated at a certain score/accuracy or just overall nothing seems to be working. Be warned that there will be a drop of scores. Once the score increases say by +10 and is stuck again, do the whole cycle again. Also, you can be in different phases of the cycle in different sections. See each section standalone and then keep a bird’s eye view of the exam.  
  
**3.1 VARC:** Your final attempt should have at least 20+ attempts in this section. One RC should be done within 7 minutes and VAs should take 2 mins. My target approach was - the three RCs I liked in 20 minutes, then 12 minutes of VA and then 8 minutes for final RC + cleaning up the mess of questions I marked to be reviewed later. Compare yourself to the above strat, and find the difference. How do you push for the above? By reading faster, and trusting yourself that you are choosing the right answer in the first go. The % increase of speed to reach the above is something you have to customize. You will find that your error rate has increased drastically. Let it go up. Don’t compromise on the speed. After 5-10 mocks, you will find that your brain has caught up with your increased reading speed in terms of comprehension.   
  
**3.2 DILR-** Set Selection can be a bit of a luck thing. Remember how I told you about making buckets? This is the time to use them. Find questions, read through them and use the bucket to determine if it is worth taking the risk. As a rule, I just avoid the first set and start reading from last because a number of aspirants will jump into the first set because of rush, and it is a very simple trap to set. This is where your learning and intuition of all the sets you did would come into effect.   
During mocks, have **A/B testing** where  
A: One coaching mocks where I prepare for a normal CAT, for efficiency and go for the easy sets only and   
B: Another coaching where all I do is stress test and push myself to whatever random set I choose. But, for B, remember that this is not a foolish push, but pushing ourselves to the limits, so give up if it doesn't work. Move to another set. Those B scores, if bad, should be logged in to the “experimental” score sheet.   
  
**3.3 Quants:** My approach was simple, 2.5 min per question, 16 questions in 40 minutes. If I can’t solve it in that time period I give up. Make yourself extremely flexible in quants so that you can jump around rapidly. While that is the ultimate goal, it's okay to start with 3 minutes and then push yourself, but once you commit to 2.5 min, do not go back. If you can’t solve it in that time period, then move to next and see if you can solve 5 instead of 4 somewhere else to recover some time.   
  
**Tricks**  
  
 Close to the end of the initial mock period, is when you should start looking for gouging out options and take intelligent guesses. But those guesses should come from- your understanding of the topic, and that CAT usually tries to have integer solutions sometimes. But this is pretty subjective so you’ll have to build your own strategies.   
  
An example from CAT 2025: There was an allegation question where the total volume was 60, and the final ratio was 15:4. So, total volume would be a 19x answer, the lowest 19x > 60 litres was 76, so I guessed 16. While this guessing works with certain assumptions, if there are TITAs left and you have to guess, make those assumptions and guess instead of haphazard ones. 

**Accuracy:**

1. 75% is the absolute bare minimum if you want. **Push for speed only when you have that accuracy**. Keep yourself flexible enough to drop speed in case of a more difficult paper and vice versa. And this understanding of a mock will come only if you are cognizant of what you are doing during mocks. Mocks are not just for solving at this point of time, but also being aware of WHAT you are doing through that 40 min. If needed, document it.   
And then sit and think   
what you did,   
what you want to do,   
where is the gap, and   
how to address it.   
  
  
2. You will randomly sometimes find accuracy dropping for a period of time. Do not fret during those periods. There will be long periods of random stagnancy which don’t make sense, and the only thing that you can control is to take mocks, analyse and move on. There will be some problems that fix themselves, and all you gotta do is not panic and give yourself time.   
  
**Stamina: Level Two**  
  
1. At this point, you should have taken a fair number of mocks. Your speed is also increasing. Now it is time to build stamina. In September-October, you should be taking 2 mocks at least one day in a week and 2-3 mocks on alternate days. In between these intensity periods, chalk yourself a couple of days of rest to recuperate.   
  
My flow was intense September, then a slow start to October, building it up to an extreme stress of October end where I was taking one mock a day almost for 15 days. Then the beginning of November, then started November with a lull of a week of almost nothing, then started building up towards the end of November that I peaked around the exam.   
  
2. If you feel you are burning out, stop. But, that is only if you have pushed through a week of 5 mocks. If you are burning out after 2 days of mocks, the stamina is low and needs to be pushed. Make that call accordingly.   
  
3. Should you push for stamina and speed together? At times, yes, when you’re mentally in that space to take the hit in terms of scores and not get demoralized. Preferably not in the beginning of September when you’re pushing for stamina the very first time, play a little safe, and once you get in the groove, then you can push for both.   
  
**Fatigue, Mood and Post-Exam Emotional State**  
  
1. Feeling a bit burnt-out or fatigue and tired are different states. Since this is subjective, you’ll have to learn to differentiate, and if you’re feeling tired, stop immediately. No learning happens when you’re tired.   
  
2. Start practicing stabilizing feelings of panic and fear early. A cat paper at the end should be like the flow state you are in as you’re driving a car, based more on intuition and practice and not emotions. Take deep breaths in the mock itself, mentally tell yourself to realign and start afresh when stuck.   
  
3. The target for your post-mock emotional state should be neutral, no matter how the paper went. That goal is helpful during paper because it helps you be unaffected by temporary setbacks which will happen randomly on D-day because every variable cannot be as controlled as we like.   
  
4. If you feel anxious closer to D-day, a simple trick is to take a bucket of cold water, bring it in your room and dip your feet in it and sit for a couple minutes.   
  
**Confidence**  
  
No matter what the mock score, do not let your confidence waver at any cost. But do not stop stress testing yourself out of fear. Your confidence should come from the fact that you have taken all possible variables that your life can have, quantified them and thought about them far more than everyone. Randomize your stress testing.  
  
**Silly Mistakes**  
  
I never found a solution to that myself. I usually make zero silly mistakes when under extreme duress, but make a lot of them during mocks. At the end, I just gave up and focused on bettering my execution and ignoring whatever silly errors were there.   
  
**Thought**  
  
**This is written last but is the most important.**   
Spend time thinking what changes can be made, tweaked and constantly do A/B testing of them through mocks. Document your findings and make decisions. And importantly remember that if you feel a certain strategy is something you can’t handle on D-Day even though it's smarter, abandon it. 

**Know when to stop.**  
If you feel exhausted when you wake up, not getting enough sleep, mocks start going haywire without reason, accuracy has dropped to 50, struggling to push through no matter how much you push, it is time to take a step back. Recuperation is needed for thinking, so don’t compromise on that. **Consider CAT a high-performance game, and yourself, a high-performance athlete and care for yourself accordingly.**  
  
**By this point, you should take 50+ mocks.**   
  
**D-Day Prep:**  
  
1. Get new glasses if your specs are getting scratchy and older. Buy a strip of zinc and a multivitamin supplement. Take one each on the morning of D-Day. But make sure you test those supplements out beforehand at least a month ago as to any potential effects like diarrhoea. (I am not a medical professional, **strongly pointing it out that the above is my opinion**, this is simply based on the fact I have found that a slight micronutrient overload overcomes any tiredness that I have) Would mostly recommend going to a doctor to plan it out. 

2. **Get vaccinated**: Would recommend getting a flu-shot. Make sure it's a Northern Hemisphere shot of the current year. Why? Because I feel the risk isn’t worth it. Sort out early if you have allergy issues. Keep diarrhoea medication, digene, and Coldact (or any other variant)- the latter is an over-the-counter common cold symptom suppressant. Just in case you get a cold in November. Keep Meftal handy if you’re expecting your cycle around that time, and if it makes you sleepy, see a doctor and make early arrangements. If you're expecting Day 1 or 2, then XXXL and inshallah I guess.  
  
2. As soon as the Admit Card hits, make your travel arrangements if in another city. Make it as comfortable as possible. If you’re a regular gym goer, try finding a hotel with at least a couple of pieces of equipment. Travel 2 days ago instead of the day before. Preferably get one with a buffet if slot 3 so that you don't have to worry about breakfast.  
  
3. A lot of centers have places to keep the bag and a lot do not. For your piece of mind, I’d recommend having a room.   
  
4. If slot 1, do not overload carbs before the exam. I do not recommend coffee, but if you need caffeine, make it a month-long habit from beforehand. Coffee is a diuretic, so make a habit of coffee an hour before mocks so that you can simulate exam experience and decide whether you want to consume or not.   
  
5. For slot 3, have breakfast around 8 am and an early lunch of around 12 pm of a chicken salad for meat eaters. That will fill you up as well as not make you sleepy.   
  
6. Going to the centre: I prefer going early and making myself comfortable. For the one hour you wait, remember the only thing: You have strategized, thought and prepared as much as you could. So it does not matter what the paper is going to be because you have already thought about it. Rely on your intuitions for strategy at this point and only focus on solving. If stuck, move on immediately. No second guessing yourself, and definitely not letting your thoughts wander. Your goal is to maximise, maximise, maximise.   
  
**Part 4: Working people**  
  
**I am a working person too, and the above may feel a little too much. How to incorporate prep in time?**  
  
1. Discipline- Till D-Day, I had little life myself. When I took breaks from mocks or study, I focused on chores. Additionally, I removed every **decision fatigue** from my life. Bought 5 copies of the same outfit. Made a meal plan to repeat every week. Refused to eat anything out of the ordinary lest I fall sick. And meal prep- I prepared hard. Cooked twice a week in big batches and flash froze and stored them. Cooked rice for 3 days at a time and shoved the pressure cooker in the fridge. Cooked intensely dense dal and then watered it down later with salt-water.   
Or, you can move to a PG which will save a ton of this effort. Optimise every breathing second with a thought out plan and stick to it till you’re sick of it, and then continue to do so. My simple philosophy is- my body will not lose to my mind. I am obstinate enough to be sick of life but I refuse to give up. (**That does not mean no breaks)**  
  
2. Optimizing in office- Whenever I took a break from work, that was the time for me to reflect and strategize. I used to walk and think where I could eke out a small bit of efficiency more in a 2 hour paper. Got Youtube premium and just listen to revision videos like a podcast. Same during the commute.   
  
3. Personally, I feel the first push for prep should be in the final semester, when the academic stress is at its lowest. But in case you are working already, make a 2 year plan instead of time. This plan is keeping in mind you’re targeting ABC, and adjust according to your flexibility.   
  
4. Do not resign for CAT. CAT does not need an all day prep plan.   
  
At the end, your timeline should be similar to this- 

|**Phase**|**Months**|**Focus**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Base|Nov-Apl|Study material|
|Transition|May–Jul|First mocks|
|Strategy|Jul–Sep|Speed & errors|
|Stress|Aug mid -Oct|High mock density|
|Taper|Nov|Floor protection|



Finally remember, hard work and talent is important, but strategy is too.

The former two pillars need the base of strategy and thought to be impactful.  
Do not comment profiles for calls, I do not know.  
  
 I just took CAT a couple weeks ago and had promised myself that I’ll make a strategy post if I get all the calls I want, that’s it.

The coffee was too hot, and still I drank it like it owed me answers. It scalded my tongue on the first sip. I didn’t care. The windshield reflected nothing but clouds, gray, low, indecisive. Like the sky was trying to make up its mind about whether to fall or just watch.

I leaned back, coffee steaming in one hand, guilt simmering in the other. I’d told her off. Again. Told her the world didn’t need more polished predators with god complexes. And still, here I was.

I tossed the empty cup onto the floorboard. The plastic crunch sounded final. Then I stepped out of the car and into the shadow of the Institute.

The architecture was designed to intimidate, brutalism wrapped in glass. The corridors inside were no better. Long, sterile stretches of white tile that smelled of ozone and aggressive cleaning chemicals. My boots echoed too loudly against the floor. Click. Clack. Cameras swiveled silently on the ceiling, black glass eyes tracking my heat signature. I didn’t look up. I knew they were there, just like I knew the doors locked from the outside.

We called it a school. It felt like a containment unit.

I passed the memorial wall, digital screens scrolling names of “fallen heroes.” I didn’t stop. I knew how many of those names belonged to kids who were pushed too hard, too fast. When I reached the heavy steel door of Classroom 4B, I took a breath, buried the cynicism deep in my gut, and pushed it open.

I arrived ten minutes late. They were already there. Tasha had her boots on the desk. Danny was sketching nervous patterns in a notebook. Livia and Sofia whispered, sharing a private joke. Gabe was balancing a pen, trying to look bored. And Leo was in his chair, looking like a smudge on a camera lens, there, but barely.

I stepped in. The chatter died.

“Alright,” I said, voice rougher than intended. “Field trip.”

“A test?” Gabe asked, perking up.

“A reality check,” I replied. “Bring your gear. You’ll hate it.”

\-----

The training arena was a hollowed-out concrete dome, lit by industrial floodlights that hummed with a headache-inducing frequency. And there she was. Elis. She stood in the center of the room, looking like she had walked out of a high-fashion gala and taken a wrong turn into a slaughterhouse.

She was breathtaking. There was no other word for it. Her uniform was tailored, hugging curves that I knew from a lifetime ago. Her black hair was pinned up in an intricate, flawless style, exposing the elegant line of her neck. She smelled like jasmine and rain, a scent that had haunted my apartment for years after she left.

She didn’t look at me. Not really. Just that professional glaze over her eyes that hid everything we weren’t allowed to say.

“You’re late, Zenos,” she said. Her voice was silk wrapped around steel.

“Traffic,” I lied.

“Liar,” she replied, not missing a beat. She gestured to the four stretchers behind her. The “Silent Volunteers.” The students shifted uncomfortably as the thick, chemical smell of preservation fluid clashed violently with the delicate scent of Elis’s perfume.

“Today isn’t about hitting targets,” I announced, turning to the class. “It’s about composure. These aren’t drones. They’re organic matter. They used to be people. Now, they are tools.” I nodded at Elis.

She didn’t cut herself. She didn’t bleed. She didn’t do anything crude. She simply raised her hands, fingers dancing like she was playing an invisible piano. A low hum filled the air. Violet energy sparked from her fingertips, thin, translucent threads of light that spooled out into the air. They were beautiful. Hypnotic. The threads drifted down, latching onto the corpses. One thread to the neck. One to the spine. One to the heart.

Elis twitched her index finger. The first corpse jerked. It sat up, the motion smooth and unnatural, pulled by the invisible strings. Elis looked bored. Serene. A goddess puppeteering the dead without getting a speck of dust on her gloves.

“They feel nothing,” Elis said, her eyes finally locking onto mine. A challenge. “They are just vessels. Do what you must.”

“Group one. Danny. Bea.”

The drill began. Danny stepped up, blood already pooling in his palms. Bea was chewing a lime gummy, eyes darting nervously. Elis flicked her wrist. The corpse lunged, fast, too fast for a shambler.

“Left flank!” Bea yelled. “Liver is sour!”

Danny reacted. He didn’t just splash the blood; he shaped it. He hardened it into a whip, cracking it against the zombie’s chest. The impact knocked the creature back, but Elis’s violet threads pulled it upright instantly.

“Harder,” Elis commanded coldly.

Danny gritted his teeth, focused, and drove a spear of crystallized blood through the thing’s shoulder. It dropped. Elis severed the threads with a sharp inhale. The violet light faded. The body became just meat again.

“Gabe. Trent.”

Gabe was eager. Trent was a nervous wreck. Elis animated the second corpse. This time, she made it run. Gabe panicked, firing a shockwave that went wide. Trent tried to dodge, tripped over his own sparks, and slid across the floor.

“Focus!” I barked.

Gabe corrected his stance. He waited. One breath. Two. Then he released. Boom. He hit the corpse center-mass. Ribs cracked. The body flew backward, Elis’s energy threads stretching like rubber bands before she let them snap.

“Sofia. Mina.”

The quiet ones. Elis made the third corpse crawl, a spider-like, broken movement that made my skin crawl. Sofia didn’t flinch. She whispered, and spiders poured from her sleeves, weaving a net of silk across the floor. The corpse got tangled. Mina sneezed, and roots burst from the concrete, wrapping the body in a tight embrace. Elis tugged on her energy threads, trying to break the corpse free, but the roots held. She raised an eyebrow, impressed.

“Enough,” I said.

“Tasha. Clint.”

Tasha didn’t wait. She charged. Elis smirked and made the fourth corpse jump, high, superhumanly high. Clint stood still, staring up. “Kinetic lock… disengaged.” The corpse stopped in mid-air. Just froze. Tasha jumped, fist crackling with lightning, and slammed the suspended body into the ground. Dust settled. The students cheered.

I looked at Elis. For a second, the mask slipped. She looked tired. Not physically, she never got tired, but soul-tired. She looked at me, and I saw the woman I used to hold. Then she blinked, and the Association’s perfect soldier was back.

“One left,” she said.

“Nico. Livia. Final round.”

Nico phased in and out of reality. Livia sketched the future. Elis re-connected the threads to the first corpse. It stood up, broken shoulder and all. Nico tried to punch it and phased right through.

“Solidify, kid!” I yelled.

Livia turned the page. “Step left.” Nico stepped left. The zombie’s fist missed his ear by an inch. Nico solidified his leg and kicked the knee joint. Crunch. The corpse went down.

“Good,” I muttered. “Review later.”

Then I looked at the back of the room. At the empty chair that wasn’t empty.

“Leo.”

The name hung in the air like smoke. He looked up, eyes wide. He looked around to see who I was talking to.

“You,” I said. “Center stage.”

The class turned. The silence was heavy.

“Go, Leo!” someone shouted. I think it was Bea.

Leo flinched. He looked like he wanted to fold in on himself. Being seen was painful for him. I could see the panic rising in his throat. Slowly, he stood up. He walked to the center of the arena, his posture screaming apology.

I nodded to Elis. “Last target. Make it walk.”

Elis raised her hand. The violet threads spun out, latching onto the last un-battered corpse. It rose. It was big. Heavy. And it was staring right at Leo.

Leo stood there, trembling. He wasn’t looking at the zombie. He was looking at the floor, at his hands, at anything but the monster. The corpse took a step. Then another. Elis made it reach out. Leo looked up. He saw the dead eyes. He saw the violet strings puppeteering the horror.

He didn’t fight. He didn’t run. He just looked offended by its existence. Terrified that it perceived him.

“Disappear,” he whispered.

It wasn’t a spell. It was a rejection of reality.

Snap.

A sound like a violin string breaking echoed through the dome. Elis gasped, a sharp, shocked intake of air. She stumbled back, clutching her hand as the violet energy threads whipped back, severed. And the zombie? It didn’t fall. It didn’t explode. It was just gone. No dust. No residue. The space where it had been was empty. The air rushed in to fill the vacuum with a soft whoosh.

Elis stared at her empty threads, her composure shattered. She looked at Leo with genuine fear. Leo stood alone in the center of the circle. He blinked, looked at his hands, and then looked at us.

The silence this time wasn’t awkward. It was terrified. And for the first time, nobody looked away.

\-----

# Leo

It saw me. It actually saw me. I don’t know what’s worse, being invisible, or suddenly not.

I looked up and the teacher, Zenos, he saw me. He said my name. He pointed. And then the class, they all turned.

“Go, Leo!”

The cheer hit me like a stone. It wasn’t support. It was exposure. Like peering under a rock to see the bugs scurry. I stood up because I had to. The air felt too thick, clogging my throat. Every step toward the center of the arena felt like walking through glass.

Don’t look at me. Please, stop looking at me.

I reached the center. The lights were too bright. Then the woman, Elis, she raised her hand. I saw the violet threads. To everyone else, they probably looked like magic. To me, they looked like leashes. Glowing, vibrating veins of light connecting her perfect fingers to the thing on the stretcher.

The thing sat up. Its dead eyes locked onto mine. And that was it. The breaking point.

It wasn’t just a corpse. It was an observer. It was perceiving me. It was registering my existence. It was pulling me into its reality, and I didn’t want to be there. The corpse stumbled forward, the violet strings jerking its limbs. It reached out. I could feel its focus on me like a physical weight. Gross. Heavy. Invasive.

It was going to touch me. It was going to verify that I was real.

No.

I wanted it gone. Not dead, it was already dead. I wanted the perception gone. I wanted the space it occupied to be empty so I could breathe again. I forgot about the class. I forgot about Zenos. I forgot I was supposed to be weak.

I looked at the space the monster occupied, and I rejected it.

“Disappear.”

I didn’t shout. It wasn’t a spell. It was just a correction.

SNAP.

The sound was awful, like reality breaking a bone. The violet threads severed instantly, whipping back toward Elis like cut wires. And the corpse? It didn’t explode. It didn’t crumble. The universe just blinked. And when it opened its eyes again, the spot was empty.

No dust. No blood. No smell of rot. Just perfect, terrifying nothingness.

Silence flooded the room. Cold. Stunned. I stood alone in the vacuum I had created. I looked up. Zenos was staring. Elis was staring, clutching her hand where the connection had snapped. The class was staring.

They weren’t cheering anymore. And this time, no one forgot. Not even me.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",1,1765628141.0,ClassF,0,1.0,False

This is my first big post and I’m super nervous so I’ll try and make this digestible! Here’s some trigger warnings because I don’t want to blindside you! TW!! : !!!Mentions of SA!!!! This is a super heavy subject so I totally understand if you want to scroll off but I need to get this off my chest since it’s eating me alive!

So for some background! I was born in North Carolina and lived there for a couple of years with my siblings, Brayden (M11), Sandy (F12), and Joey (M9). My Dad (50) and Mom (40) had me! Brayden and Sandy are on my mom’s side and Joey is on my Dad’s. They both had separate marriages and their kids before divorce and having me! (These events I didn’t learn about till this year, I am now 18. At a young age Joey started to display signs of a few mental illnesses that seemed to progressively become worse. BPD and Operational Defiance Disorder to name a few. After diagnosis came out my dad spent thousands of dollars into expensive therapy and care facilities that Joey never utilized. It was obvious that Joey hated my mom and hated the separation, and learned very quickly that lying was his greatest weapon against her. My mom worked in the hospital at the time, and he used it. He spun a lie to his therapist that she would attack him, these allegations had to be taken seriously, which meant my mother had her license revoked while the investigation went on. At this time my father was sending his ex-wife half of his paycheck, which was not a part of child support as that was never in any agreement they made. He constantly bounced between states, leaving my mother with four mouths to feed and barely any income. Eventually the investigation turned up nothing but by the time everything was normal the house had to be sold and we had to move. 

(Congrats on reading this far!)

We moved to California when I was four with the rest of my siblings. My father spent a tremendous amount of money on starting a business, and my mom worked back-to-back graveyard shifts. I was raised by my sister Sandy as my brother Brayden left due to my father’s mental abuse, something I would soon learn of. Joey lived with his mom full-time as we lived in her state now, and they were closer. Years went by until I was 8! Joey was making some routine visits by the house, and as an unsuspecting kid, I didn’t know about what had happened in NC and treated him like a brother. He was now 17 and told me all about the cool video games he liked. I showed him my new room that my mom redid with my sister. He closed my door, and after that night, I trauma-blocked the whole night. 

Joey made visits time to time after, but a lot of what happened really involved my dad. At age 12, I started helping at the business. I started to love helping out and talking with the staff about the new Pokémon I would catch on my DS. Freshman year, I really got into it, basically becoming a staff member, but I started to make some bad choices, and I went on lockdown for a year. In that time, I had gotten the most vivid memory of that night with Joey. I remember every detail. I told my mom because I was scared and confused. She sat me down and explained the whole thing about how some things are so stressful for a mind to understand that they get locked away until the mind feels equipped to deal with the overwhelming stress. My mom knew my father and told me to tell him about it with her in a controlled environment to stop him from losing it. 

(Also Brayden(27) Sandy(28) at this time!) 

I told him about the memory, the agony of it all, and he was silent. His face was deadpan and scared. I started to cry, and so did my mom, but my mom was furious. He had destroyed so much of her life that she wouldn’t let him hurt anyone else. I told him to cut him off completely. I was scared of him, but he yelled at me, saying not to give him a timeline on when he should do things. It was only when my mom agreed and said what I said that my father agreed to cut contact. But the weeks after, he grew distant and cold. My father has always been cold and rude to me, always making cruel jokes to others about me, really tearing me down. Always saying how terrible I was at helping him. Saying I didn’t deserve a single dollar I made from working, even though I would work full shifts, even doubles, and never make hourly, just tips. I told him that I felt alone, that he never tried to comfort me or help since the first night. His response was plain, “So you think I’m a bad dad?” I was so heartbroken and angry, but I didn’t want him to be mad at me, so I conceded. He told me the following night that he blocked him, that I was safe. A month passes, and I’m sitting in his car on the way to work, and his phone is connected to the Bluetooth console displaying music. A message comes up clear as day from Joey. I felt my stomach drop. I thought he was blocked. My father said that he keeps reaching out, but my father never responds or looks at the messages. That put me at ease, but something felt wrong. I felt there was more that he wasn’t telling me or my mom. I will admit that snooping is wrong, but I was so shattered that I needed to know what else was going on. I tapped on the message and found countless messages between my father and Joey, them talking about their lunches they had been going on, the movies that had gone to see with each other. All while lying to me and telling me he cut contact. (Note that I hadn’t seen a movie with my father in years. He always opted out.) I took photos and sent them to my mom because I had no idea what else to do. We confronted him a day later with receipts; all he had to say for himself was to scream at me for invading his privacy. I felt so small. I was changed forever, and he didn’t even see that; all he saw was himself and Joey. I realized I didn’t have much place in his life anymore. My mom gave him an ultimatum, which resulted in him truly blocking Joey for the foreseeable future. Life seemed to just progress after that; my scars never healed, but time did its best on the wounds. 

My 18th rolled around and was amazing! All my friends showed up; it was fantastic. It was thrown at work, and all my coworkers were there; it was the best birthday I’ve ever had! But coming home was something pretty scary. My father stayed behind cleaning up while my mom, my friend, and I all packed up and headed home. We have a good group of dogs, which only increased as my brother Brayden came to live with us again, bringing two big dogs into the house. One of our smaller old dogs was convulsing and seemed to be having seizures. This was horrifying to see as this dog has been with my family for years, and to see him like that was horrible. I couldn’t drive yet, and neither could my friend. My mom called my father over and over again, tears in her eyes, holding our dog as he twitched. My friend and I stepped outside to shed some tears and wait for her mom. 
I went back inside, and my mom had finally gotten ahold of my father and was on his way. I took myself off to my room to change. I heard my father’s car pull up the driveway. I walked down the hall to greet him when he started screaming at my mom. The image alone hurts me to remember. My mom’s a tough cookie, but in that moment, holding our dog, she looked so broken. My father bellowed at her, and with tears, she said to please calm down as this was already so much. He screamed to never say that again and to get in the car, before turning  to me, who had been silent, and yelled at me to do a chore I hadn’t done. It wasn’t until hours later they returned. He had chipped his tooth, and a small nerve ending was exposed, causing him pain. Everything was fixed up, but something was truly falling apart elsewhere. My sister, Sandy, returned home as well, right before everything took a turn . Nearly two weeks after my birthday, my mom went alone into my father’s home office and closed the door. I tried to eavesdrop but didn’t hear much. She came out over an hour later and mixed her spaghetti sauce. 
“What was that?” I asked, 
“spaghetti bolognese,”
 “No, the talk with Dad?” 
“Oh! I told him I’m divorcing him”
I swear the world spun. A feeling of shock and relief washed over me. The details are long-winded, but the process was extremely difficult. I had endured so much emotional abuse and neglect I couldn’t bear to take it anymore. I never said a word to him. He had given me silence. I will gladly give it back. He wanted a family dinner, to “talk about things.” I reluctantly agreed, but my mom assured me that I have full reign to say what I need to say. It was horrifically awkward in the beginning. He was smiling and asking about how school was going. He never took interest in me before, only to use it against me later. I was flat in the beginning stages. We were waiting for my sister and brother to get home to truly start the full talk, so dinner dragged on. When they sat down and had a few bites, the talk really began.

It started with my mom, talking about her feeling of forced silence. She felt trapped with no way out, a cage he made for her. Then it was my turn. I stated the facts. I felt disregarded, hated, and seen as secondary. I explained that his awful quips and judgmental comments pushed me down emotionally. With my mom, he listened and apologized. But as I explained how I felt, he began to cut me off, over and over and over again. Correcting how he would never do that. I would explain that making constant jokes about my weight made me self-conscious and really hurt my feelings. He smiled and said he never did that, and I twisted his words around to make him out to be a villain. I explained how I felt unloved and that he never cared for me. To that one, he laughed. That sent my sister over the edge. She yelled, explained that I have valid feelings and that I deserve to say what I need to say, and to never do that again. I’ve never felt more seen in a conversation as she made me feel. I moved on to explaining how him using my insecurities against me was horrible and it made me feel terrible. I explained my fear of my coworkers only talking to me because I was his son and that I wanted them to like me for who I am. He said in the moment that he knows they don’t feel that way. But one night behind the counter, I was talking to one of them, and he said loudly, “Get out from behind the counter. Nobody really wants to talk to you. They only talk to you because you’re my son, right -coworker-?” I was heartbroken by this. My lack of laughter and everyone being uncomfortable spurred a huge fight where he would scream and act dangerous. My brother and sister went after explaining their shared hurt, my brother’s emotional abuse, and my sister’s emotional neglect. Both being deeply wounded by their experiences. When all was said and done, he gave a halfhearted apology and left till midnight. 

A few nights later, there was silence from me as I no longer had anything to say to him. He caught me late at night in the living room, holding over the fact that he owns my phone and its service, and he’s getting it turned off in the morning(i.e in a couple of hours). Since my sister, my mom, and he share this line, I asked if he had told them about it, which he said no, but in a way that confused why he would need to tell them. I explained that if he’s turning all the services off, they should know too, and he replied with “I’m only turning yours off.” I was confused and angry as being targeted is completely unfair and petty as a now 60-year-old man. He goes into the fact that I haven’t talked to him at all, and I explain that I’m not interested in talking to him anymore as I have said my piece. Throughout the whole conversation, he keeps saying, “stop yelling” and “why are you raising your voice.” The entire conversation, I have been at normal speaking tones and keep getting more flustered as he cuts me off saying that. My mom wakes up and asks what’s going on. I explain the whole situation, and her face contorts before backing me, saying how that’s petty and childish. This goes on for hours, as I explain and re-explain why I feel the way I do about the things he brings up. My sister and brother walk out as well and sit next to me. My father starts to shrivel, saying he’s being ganged up on, and I explain that, “no, you just can’t lie and push buttons without a second party also shutting you down on it.” The argument started at 4 a.m. and lasted till 8 a.m. I skipped school and went to sleep. These fights began to be a regular occurrence. All coming to a head a few weeks after I stopped helping at work. I came in to grab a coffee, and my coworkers were looking at me weird, and I asked what’s up, and they said that my father told them that if I come in, not let me near the register because he thinks I’m stealing. I was in shock. I never made hourly so I barely was getting enough money at all for the amount of labor I was doing. I would pull single shifts alone while opening and closing only getting tips. The accusation was absurd, i knew damn well that stealing was wrong and that it would only cause me problems. I explained that I have never and will never steal and that it’s a completely baseless accusation. My coworkers agreed that it felt weird the way my father told them and that they knew me. I told my mom and we came to the conclusion it was turning into a smear campaign against my character. So I refused to go back from that day loving toward. I talked to a few other coworkers and they expressed the sorrow that I wouldn’t return but understood why. A little while later I found out one of my coworkers was having her last day soon and i said I would come in and wish her a fair-well! But leading up I heard that Joey had begun frequenting my work. The place that I spent years of my life at, infiltrating by my abuser. It crushed me. In addition finding out that he was on payroll when I would work doubles all summer every day and never made payroll was salt to the wound. I always knew he loved him more. It was just so horrible having to face it. Him being loved more when my father knew what he’d done. I went in to wish my coworker a happy last day. But my skin was crawling. What if he was here? Was he? Would would I do if I saw him? I thought I was gonna throw up. I wrapped up our goodbyes and went home, running as fast as I could to my car. As I pulled into my driveway notifications flooded my phone. Both the on shift coworkers messaged me about what happened when I left. She explained that my father pulled her aside and said that she shouldn’t talk to me anymore, that I was a wicked person. I wanted to cry, why would my own father do this? I loved him and this is what he does to me? I did some digging through messages and found a thread where Joey said I lied about everything, and was trying to make him out to be a monsters. He brought up points that if you really paid attention never lined up correctly. But my father believed every word. I felt ruined, how could I convince my own father to see what happened to me? And to stop trying to alienate me from the people I love at work?(I am still in constant with them! They are so kind and really helped the healing process!) 

My graduation was looming near, I would have cut him off completely if it weren’t for my car. His name is primary on the insurance, meaning if I wanted to legally drive my car, I would need to have him sign it over to me. So in an act of good faith I was told to invite him. Although I really didn’t want him there, I needed to make sure he would sign the car over to me, no more strings would be attached and I would be completely free. I give him the ticket and he takes it like he expected he had to be there. I let it go and the day of my grad I have my family and my partner, they hadn’t met and I didn’t see a reason they should meet now since the insurance day is the the day after graduation. I get suited up and do the walk out to the field and wave to my loved ones, and graduation goes on. Behind the scenes I find out that my family and partner sit up in the bleachers and Brayden asked my father if he wants to sit with them which he declines and stands off the the side the whole time. After I get out into the ocean of happy parents I take a scan for my father and find that he’s gone, seeming to have left just before I got out. I go have my dinner and the next day rolls around and we get to the AAA to sign over the insurance. He doesn’t say anything to me or my mom, making a thick fog of tension over the whole thing. We are called up and she explains the process to me and my mom while my father looks bored and acts annoyed. The fee came up and my mom had agreed beforehand that she will pay with a check and that it’s no bother. But before she can write anything he throws down two twenty dollar bills onto the table at the lady. And as she’s explaining some of the benefits of having a member card, in the middle of her sentence my father gets up and storms off. No words exchanged. We finish up and he meets us at the door asking if there’s anything else. We say no and he walks out the door before saying good luck to me and walking away. Me and my mom go on side adventure before going home to avoid conflict. When we get there my father has a completely different tone, asking to see my diploma and to go grab it to see it. I agree and go lay on my bed hoping the conversation goes away and I don’t have to engage. My mom filled me in that my father asked my mom why I don’t come visit work anymore. She agreed that it was me who should tell him. I come out with my diploma and she gives asks far too many questions about it before getting to the big question. I explain that he’s being saying extremely untrue and nasty comments about me to staff to alienate me from the place I care most about. He flies into excuses, saying the stage lied about what he said and twisted his words and none of it’s true. I explained that these were all first hand accounts of what happened and that I was extremely upset by the accusations. He doubled down and attacks my character, bringing up things that have no relevance only to hurt me. The second my mom heard what he said she started to raise her voice, absolutely ripping him apart for saying that and picking apart everything that he has done to our family. She was and will always be my hero. 

He’s moved out and I have cut contact. He has chosen the family and he wants and I have nothing to do with it. I’m happy with who I’ve got! 

So sorry this was so long if you read all this you have a fantastic attention span!
I wrote all of this in a night and it was really late I am always open to answer questions or revise anything!! Thank you again for listening to my harrowing tales of 2025 (yes most of this happened this year oh my god)",1,1765627967.0,DysfunctionalFamily,0,1.0,False

&nbsp;

## **To be clear:** as a mod team, we have no policy of enforcing bans against any particular streamers

The gist of what happened was that a newish mod wasn't properly briefed on how we enforce certain rules and, as a result, interpreted them extremely broadly. I can't know other peoples' motives, so I won't tell you that they were using this as an excuse, I'll just say that they got overzealous and when things got heated, took out their frustration via their mod powers. This took the form of antagonization over modmail, issuing bans for personal reasons, and misrepresentation of our team's moderation policies - which is to say that they pursued this course of action without consulting the rest of the team. When I became aware of the conversation, I removed her access to modmail, to investigate the rest of the messages, then removed her as a moderator afterward. I messaged the second most active mod to inform them that they was off the team without negotiation.

&nbsp;

## The bans

The bans __have been reversed__ as-of this post

&nbsp;

## The automod filter

**Now, I want to be as transparent as possible here** - *this wasn't entirely the fault of the ex moderator who broke from policy*. First and foremost, as head mod, the blame lies on me for not ensuring that this ex mod was briefed on how to go about enforcing the rules. I presumed, as they were a recommendation, that they had already been brought up to speed. Secondly, You may have noticed a number of posts and comments being removed from the subreddit. Almost none of these were done by the mod team, *not even the mod we removed*. A small number of posts were removed early into the drama, by junior mods, who were confused about the spam and lacked context.

These were largely the result of one particular automoderator rule that **I** wrote specifically to handle a drama that was boosted by Odablock fans a while back. To be clear, this filter should not have existed anymore in the form it did. Our time frequently gets wasted by dickheads, just like Jagex support. Now, we typically do let protests play out normally, but at the time we only had around 2 active mods including myself. I took some shortcuts, and that had consequences that didn't present themselves in an acute way. People only really noticed once people were sure it was already happening, but the filter had been there since whenever the Stella incident occurred.

Now, hear me out - I'm sure even /r/2007scape, or /r/ironscape, or /r/runescape moderators will tell you - it's a hassle, and managing it is simply too much to do with ONLY the tools that Reddit gives us by default, especially with ""New Reddit"" and Mobile Reddit. I won't pretend to be the GOAT of moderators, but I do what I can. We utilize a variety of tools, including Reddit Moderator's Toolkit, and Reddit Enhancement Suite to reduce the workload.

We also use some fairly comprehensive automoderator filters to remove spam about certain topics. Most of this is to combat spammers who stick to a general pattern of speech, phrases, or dialogue - along with in-game ban appeals, stream links, video links, untrustworthy domains, etc. __The filter in question was added after an Odablock video regarding the Stella controversy__ - it was implemented *after* Stella was banned and her ex(?) demodded. Honestly, we never really liked reposts of Youtube links, especially since brigading from a streamer's fans can quickly make the subreddit feed look awful. This is why we've had an automod filter in-place that directs users to instead post video links to /r/OSRSContent, and ban appeals to /r/RSBans, which **is** a configuration we've been meaning to rework for a bit. The filter responsible for removing Odablock related posts was supposed to be made less restrictive, after the drama died down, but honestly I forgot because it's not like we get paid and nobody reminded me LOL

&nbsp;

## Fixing issues with post removals

The filter has been removed as-of the time of this posting. That being said, some users in this sub are being flagged separately. Either by Reddit's Anti-Evil Team (or a site admin), or our own spam list (this is likely if you have spammed here in the past 👀) To be as blunt as possible, we utilize a lot of automation to make our job as moderators as easy as possible.

&nbsp;

In this instance, we missed the mark. __We'd like to apologize to everyone affected, and that includes *Omar*.__

This all started right about the time I was set to leave for work, so I ended up not being able to directly address anything until after I got home, which is more or less why this all had time to brew. I could maybe have done a half-assed job of looking into it, but frankly I'm not trying to be distracted at work by my ""Reddit Moderator Duties"", no offence guys 😏

In retrospect, I should have asked the other mods to get more involved, but to be fair, I didn't get a ton of info before I left, and I was a bit cranky at the situation, as I had basically delayed grabbing coffee in order to investigate to the extent I did.

&nbsp;

## Moving forward

We'll be taking a closer look at the automoderator rules in the near-future as well as the mod list.

Keep in mind, this is not a green-flag to shill or spam, we still don't like that sort of thing around here.

&nbsp;

## tl;dr

A rogue mod banned some guy and brought up runescape politics in modmail and now half the sub is losing their mind, a quarter of which were actually seen because a robot was doing its job too well, and a tiny fraction of-which had their posts removed by our junior mods who have no ability to ban anyone because they were confused about the spam 😂

The house was too clean. That was the first sign.

The lights were blazing, the floorboards swept bare, the couch cushions fluffed into rigid squares. The air didn’t smell like home; it smelled of industrial lemon cleaner used to scrub away a crime scene. Or in this case, disappointment.

I froze just inside the threshold. My sneakers made no sound on the rug, a synthetic, beige thing that always felt like walking on a lie.

“Mom?” I called out.

No answer.

Then footsteps.

They were heavy. Deliberate. The sound of someone who owned the ground they walked on.

Jerrod.

He rounded the corner, a towel slung casually over one shoulder, a glass of water in hand. He looked relaxed, like he hadn’t spent the entire week turning my social life into ash.

“Oh,” he said, a smile pulling at the corner of his mouth. Just enough to be a threat. “You survived.”

I didn’t answer. I just gripped the strap of my backpack tighter.

He jerked his chin toward the ceiling. “Mom’s upstairs. Gave strict orders not to kill each other.”

“Then maybe go for a walk.”

He chuckled, low and dry. “Still bleeding for attention, huh, Danny?”

I clenched my jaw and tried, really tried, to walk past him. I just wanted to get to the stairs. To the safety of a locked door.

But he stepped in the way.

He was close enough that the air around him felt warmer. That was the thing about Jerrod. He always ran hot. He smelled of ozone and expensive cologne, a scent worn like armor.

“You embarrass yourself, you know that?” he said.

“Move.”

“You embarrass me.”

Something inside me snapped. A thin, fragile wire that had been holding me together all day finally gave way.

“You think everything is about you,” I spat, the words tumbling out before I could check them. “Just because you can sparkle on command? Just because you’re the golden boy who heats up like a forge, you think you’re the second coming of glory?”

Jerrod didn’t move. He didn’t even blink. He just watched me with that infuriating, pitying calm.

So I kept going. I couldn’t stop.

“You humiliate me at school. You make me feel like a stranger in my own house. And I still try! I keep my head down, I survive, I get blood on my hands, and it’s never enough!”

The pressure hit me then.

It wasn’t a headache. It was a surge. A sudden, violent expansion behind my eyes.

My nose started to bleed.

Not a trickle. A purge.

It was sharp, hot, and instant. I wiped it away with the back of my hand, but it was already pouring, sliding over my lips, dripping off my chin. My body was producing too much of it, overflowing like a dam reaching capacity.

I felt the familiar dizziness, but this time, it was different.

The blood fell from my chin, but it didn’t hit the floor.

It hung there.

Suspended in the dead air between us. Waiting. Listening.

I looked at Jerrod, not at his face, but at the heat shimmering off his skin.

And a single word echoed in my mind, ancient and instinctive: Contract.

The world seemed to tilt.

The blood obeyed.

It didn’t just float; it changed. There was a sound, a wet, sickening snap, like liquid forcing itself into a solid state. The red droplets hovering in the air convulsed and elongated. They sharpened into fine, crystalline tips. They weren’t just drops anymore.

They were needles.

I raised my trembling hand.

The needles turned, aiming straight at Jerrod’s chest.

Jerrod’s eyes widened. The arrogance flickered out, replaced by shock. His shoulders instantly lit up, his skin glowing with the dull, angry red of iron left too long in the fire. Heat radiated from him in a physical wave, causing the air to warp. His veins pulsed, outlined like molten lava beneath stone.

“You really want to do this, little brother?” His voice was tight, but the heat coming off him was searing.

I didn’t.

I really didn’t.

But the blood was singing in my ears, louder than my fear.

And then…

\-----

# Giulia

I moved before the thought even fully formed in their heads.

The second I saw Jerrod’s skin flare like a dying star and Danny’s blood crystallize into weapons, I crossed the room.

I didn’t run. Running takes time.

I blurred.

The hallway, the air, the ten feet of distance between me and disaster, it all vanished in a blink.

I reached Jerrod first. I drove an open palm into his chest, right over the sternum. Hard enough to knock the wind out of him, precise enough to extinguish his heat. He folded instantly, gasping as he hit the floor.

I didn’t stop. I spun, closing the gap to Danny.

He was still staring at his brother, eyes wide, the crimson needles trembling in the air around him. I reached out and tapped his temple with two fingers. A gentle, calculated jolt.

Sleep.

His eyes rolled back. He crumpled.

I caught him before his knees touched the wood, lowering him gently to the rug.

The hovering needles of blood lost their shape instantly, splashing down onto the floorboards as simple, harmless liquid.

The silence that followed felt heavy. Like an earthquake holding its breath.

Jerrod groaned from the floor, clutching his chest. The glow was gone from his skin, leaving him looking pale and very young. “You hit me.”

I didn’t look at him. My eyes were fixed on Danny.

I wasn’t looking at the mess on his face. I was looking at his presence.

Something had shifted. His body was limp in my arms, but the blood smeared on his skin, it felt different. It hadn’t just been leaking; it had been responding. It had been waiting.

It scared me more than anything Jerrod had ever lit on fire.

My son had power. Not just potential. Not just a gift. He had something alive, unshaped, and raw.

“Upstairs,” I said.

Jerrod was still on the floor, rubbing his chest as if to check for a bruise. “Mom, he—”

I turned my head. Just a fraction. I looked at him.

That was enough.

“Upstairs,” I repeated. “Now.”

He opened his mouth, probably to defend himself, maybe to claim self-defense, but the tone of my voice severed the thought before it could reach his tongue.

He stood up, silent. He walked past me, giving Danny’s unconscious body a wide berth. I didn’t watch him go. I only let out a breath when I heard his bedroom door click shut.

Finally alone.

I knelt beside Danny, brushing a strand of dark hair from his forehead. His skin was pale, his eyelids twitching in a dream state, his nose still streaked with drying red.

“Danny,” I whispered.

Nothing.

“Come on, sweetheart. I know you’re in there.”

His lashes fluttered. He blinked open, sluggish, groggy, the fire behind his eyes dampened by the fog I’d put him in. He looked up at me, disoriented.

“I—” he croaked. He tried to sit up, panic flaring. “I didn’t mean to. I just, he wouldn’t stop. And I felt it. The blood, it…”

“I know.” I placed a hand on his cheek to ground him. “You’re alright. You’re safe.”

He swallowed hard, his eyes darting to the blood spots on the floor. “It listened to me.”

“I know,” I said again.

I took a long breath, steadying myself. This was the moment. The pivot point.

“Danny, I’m proud of you.”

His eyes widened, confusion washing away the panic. “What?”

“I’m proud that it’s there. That you have it. That it answered you.”

He went still.

“But listen to me very carefully,” I continued, my voice dropping to that steel-edged tone I usually saved for soldiers. “Having power means nothing if it controls you.”

I let the words hang in the air between us.

“You felt strong today. I saw it. But you weren’t in control. You weren’t choosing. You were reacting.”

He looked down at his hands, stained red. “I didn’t want to hurt him.”

“I believe you,” I said. “And that’s the only reason I’m speaking calmly right now.”

He let out a shaky laugh. Just a single, fractured breath.

“You’re not weak, Danny,” I told him. “But you’re not ready, either. Not yet.” I pressed my hand over his, covering the bloodstains with my own warmth. “If you ever raise that power again, you better damn well know who it’s aimed at and why.”

Danny nodded slowly.

I searched his eyes. I didn’t see fear anymore. I didn’t see guilt.

I saw understanding.

And for now, that had to be enough.

# The Teacher

The house smelled of stale tobacco and burnt coffee.

I pushed the door open with the toe of my boot, dropped my bag, and barely got one shoe off before the smoke hit me.

“You look like hell.”

Zula was sitting at the kitchen table, a cigarette dangling from her lip, surrounded by an ashtray that was losing its battle against capacity. She didn’t look up from her crossword puzzle.

“Good evening to you too, Ma,” I muttered.

“Don’t ‘Ma’ me. You’re late. And you walk like an old man.”

“I am an old man.”

“You’re forty-two, Zenos. You’re just pathetic.” She finally looked up, her face a roadmap of deep lines and harder years. She blew a cloud of smoke towards the ceiling. “Did you eat?”

I headed for the fridge. “I was going to grab something.”

I opened the door. Inside, a single, shriveled lemon sat next to a jar of pickles that might have predated my teaching career.

“We have no food,” I stated.

“I didn’t shop. You didn’t shop. So we starve. Builds character.” She stabbed her pen onto the paper. “Stop staring at the empty fridge like it’s going to magically fill itself. It’s depressing.”

I closed the door and leaned against it, rubbing my temples. “I’m tired, Ma.”

“You’re tired because you’re wasting your time,” she snapped, her voice gravelly and sharp. “Babysitting those rejects. Digging through the trash bin of the Academy looking for something shiny. It’s beneath you.”

“They’re students. They need guidance.”

“They need a miracle,” she barked. “And you need a life. Look at you. Former Council Enforcer, and now? You come home smelling like chalk and disappointment to a mother who has to watch you rot.”

“I’m not rotting.”

“You are. And it pisses me off.” She crushed her cigarette out with unnecessary force. “You can’t lift trash without getting filthy, Zenos.”

I walked past her without arguing. I knew better. Under the venom, she was worried. She hated the apartment, the lack of food, and the silence of my career not because she cared about status, but because she hated seeing me stopped.

I went to the back room. My room.

It was a mess of papers, old files, and half-empty coffee mugs. I sat at the desk, the chair creaking in protest.

I picked up the clipboard from today’s assessment.

One name was circled.

Leo.

I stared at the name, and the memory of the test washed over me.

It hadn’t been flashy. No fire, no lightning.

I remembered the pause. The flicker.

That moment during the test where everything just skipped. Including me. My pen had stopped moving. My thoughts had cut out. My time had stuttered.

I looked at the ink on the page.

“What the hell are you?” I whispered to the empty room.

From the kitchen, Zula shouted, “Speak up, you coward!”

I didn’t answer.

I just stared at the page. The confusion was an itch I couldn’t scratch. Whatever that boy had done, it wasn’t on any chart I knew.

I started planning.

Tomorrow, I wouldn’t just watch. I wouldn’t just take notes.

I’d run a scenario. Carefully. Controlled.

Designed not to hurt anyone, but just enough chaos to see what moves when Leo’s in the room.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",2,1765627809.0,ClassF,0,1.0,False

I by surprise received a moka pot literally two days ago. Tried it three times now, twice just this morning! First time I put freshly boiled water in and my stove was on full blast, pot was super aggressive and spraying everywhere instantly so I figured I had too much heat. Slept on it, tried again in the morning, this time lukewarm water and stove on low to medium. It just... bubbled and steamed at me for half an hour, sputtering the occasional splatter of coffee out. I didn't even get a cup out of it. So I tried again, with almost boiling water and again medium heat. Again aggressive and spraying everywhere. From the little research I did it's supposed to be a slow steady flow, I'm getting nowhere near that. literally have to keep the lid closed or my kitchen looks like some coffee murder scene.  Any tips on what to try next? 

I'm using pre-ground filter coffee grounds, is that where I'm going wrong? Keep in mind I'm hardly even a filter coffee drinker, so going out of my way to buy beans and a grinder at this point of my journey would be kind of unwise. If the grind size is my issue, I'd be looking for pre-ground moka suitable beans. Do those even exist? lol

For example I got DAK Milky Cake roasted on 3rd of Nov and DAK Panettone roasted on 17th of November. 

I assume they'd be prime for brewing right now but I'm about to travel and won't come back for 3 weeks and that would be too late and even then I'd have a lot of coffees not just these two so I was thinking, is it possible to just throw the whole bag in the freezer? 

I haven't frozen coffee previously so I don't know how it goes, I have read something about zip bags and/or vacuum sealed bag but I haven't done it and I think this would be easier if it's possible. I also would like to mention that I would like to unfreeze it and drink the whole bag, not just 1-2 brews or re-freeze.

Hi! I am looking for new people to become friends with. Medyo boring and lonely ang life ko lately so why not socialize a lil bit and share a few hours of my life with someone new? I prefer hanging out to calls and chatting! I am very open to hanging out in real life din. 

about me:
28, 5'11, introvert, working, I don't drink, I don't smoke, single

I love traveling. I've been to Cebu, Bangkok, Hong Kong, and hopefully next year sa Japan with friends. I love listening to music and playing guitar. I love movies about life, love, relationships, romcom, or anything I find interesting. I tried canyoneering, whale diving, and other outdoor stuff and surprisingly I enjoyed them. 

I am a nerd when it comes to technology. I love taking pictures of places I've been. I love romanticizing road trips, city lights. I recently started running every weekend morning. I'm not that maligalig type of person but I guess it depends on the chemistry. I almost forgot the most important thing, I love iced coffee. I oftentimes think out loud. Observing and learning my surroundings and the people around me.

I kicked off the first drop in 2025 and so far it's slow going and that is fair enough. Some things I've learned:

  
\- convincing people is hard! most of the target market for speciality coffee are already stocked up, or have existing subscriptions

\- there is a real mix of market positions with some relatively new brewers who don't want to dive in the deep end of really exotic and pricey coffees, a middle ground where we're not made of money and can't afford $100 for 50g of beans, and real afficionados that are happy to splurge for all kinds of exotic coffee processes and origins

\- getting people to trust a random stranger (me) over the internet is tough, that I will actually ship out beans. Many thanks to those who took part in drop 1

\- getting people to then post about their coffees is also difficult - most of us live busy lives and want to enjoy their morning brew without having to also think of what to post up on reddit. Fair enough, but I am hoping over time we'll get a bit more community happening here! I enjoy sharing thoughts and notes on the coffees I'm drinking - and when you're all drinking the same coffee what better way to connect than over the same brew :)

  
Which brings me to what is next - I am still encouraged by the small but existing interest in this project of mine so I am here proposing some ideas for 2026. If you're at all keen please do let me know below, and what roasters or regions you'd like to see in the 2026 drops. I also am quite busy with regular life juggling work and family commitments so I'm going to try to organise a drop every other month or so with a rotation of local Aussie roasters, and some international ones in there.

  
Without further ado - my proposed 2026 drops are:

2026:

Jan: Newav (VIC) & Sample Coffee (NSW). Gabrel who runs Newav has just taken out Aus Barista Champion so certainly a bit of buzz around that

March: International roaster, probably from Asia

April: Path (VIC), Monastery (SA). Lots of experimental and different processes from these guys

June: International roaster, probably from Europe

July: Disciple (VIC), Jibbi Littles (NSW)

Sept: International roaster, probably from UK

Nov: Mantaray (VIC), Artificer (NSW). Hoping for some Black Friday sales here

Dec: Sept: International roaster, probably from USA and hoping to get some BF sales too",1,1765627158.0,BeanDrop,0,1.0,False

I am totally blind and a single 40 year old woman with no children.
I start this post off this way because I have been on 
http://nc211.org
scouring the sight for weeks now knowing I would need stuff to start up an apartment.
While I know Crystal Towers is not an ideal inhabitence its not bad for what I pay and compared to what I have been through. Also, I hate to burst people's bubbles but rent prices suck when you make less than a grand a month so it beats the streets.
Its warm, I have running water and the lights work.
Is it perfect? Well not in the slightest but its a place to lay my head.
Furthermore, though, I have nothing to start a home really. not enough furniture, no microwave, no kitchen stuff to speak of.
I have resources to feed myself, but no way to prepare the food.
I got food in my kitchen i can go run my hands over and wish i could eat, but no real way to eat it because well cup noodles and the like need a microwave.
Also someone got me a coffee maker, just has to bring it.
and I need another table for my kitchen to put the microwave on so i can use it a foot of counter space just aint enough for a coffee maker and microwave last i checked and me to move around with any type of coordination.
I have no silverware to eat with or stir anything with if i made it.
I can buy food, not a microwave, I also need to go to chrisis control Mnday at the latest when they are open again and get my deposit check I was supposed to yesterday but my body said no.
Transportation costs are the barier there. I am not quite setup with transaid that I know of.
My doctor did all the paperwork and sent it in I never heard back and my address changed since then.
I have so much I need to do and need. I also don't have cleaning supplies either, ugg. its a mess. they did give me five bucks to do laundry with but I have no laundry soap no money to get any. I am from missouri. I don't know how to get resources for this. I would go get community meals until I can get stuff, but again transportation. I can't walk very well so taking the bus isn't much of an option.
I have a pcs worker, but with no pots and pans and the like how can she cook for me and such.
I am also diabetic.
But I knew if i did not take this when it was available i would be a sitting duck for another six to nine months. and I also know there are resources, I just need ideas in the meantime. is anything open on a saturday that can help me. that isn't specifically for seniors, vets or people specificially with kids. that would be willing to help me and bring me things since i am blind. I don't give a crap what things look like as long as they function.
I am stressing since my meds require food.

1pljpeo,https://v.redd.it/ogsrq7wriy6g1,I think our daily lifestyle content is becoming our real identity,"I’ve been thinking about something lately.

We already share everything online—our routines, coffee, gym, travel, moods, outfits, even silence. Not to show off, but to express who we are in that moment.

Some people call it “content.”

But honestly, it feels more like identity.

What’s interesting is that the internet rewards extremes—viral moments, outrage, flexing—yet ignores the quiet consistency of real life. The daily habits. The soft routines. The small flexes that actually define us.

Lately, I’ve been exploring communities that recognise this shift. Where lifestyle isn’t noise—it’s signal.

Curious if others feel the same: Do you think the internet is moving from performance to identity?

1pljotr,https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1pljotr/how_to_find_music_without_spotify/,How to find music without Spotify,"So if you haven't heard, 2025 was not a particularly good year for Spotify. Artists like King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard and Deerhoof along with tons of their consumers had (rightfully) left the platform because they use artists' money to fund AI military weapons, they claim that ICE ads don't violate their policies, and so on and so forth. So here are a few ways you could discover music without the use of Spotify and their terrible algorithm, both digitally and physically.

* Go to Wikipedia: Wikipedia is a reliable source for all things, whether it be looking at an artist's discography or finding some very niche hit songs that are pretty good. If you want to find music without an algorithm, then this is a great idea for beginners.
* Reddit: Subreddits that are home to genre circles like the one you're reading this post on right now have oodles and oodles of niche, cult-favorite pop albums and tracks that barely chart. It's an algorithm made by the users. Speaking of charts...
* Looking at another country's chart: If you're tired of the Alex Warrens and Morgan Wallens that Billboard's USA charts give you, then you're sure to find some great songs if you look anywhere but the US. Billboard has tons of international charts devoted to compiling songs that are popular in other countries like Taiwan or Singapore or Malaysia. There are also charts that aren't made by Billboard, so you'll be sure to run into a song you like.
* RYM and AOTY: These sites can easily help you find albums and/or songs that are worth a try with a plethora of lists, songs, and featured reviews that area amazingly convenient into shaping your music taste.
* Public places: Going to your local coffee shop or fancy restaurant can easily help you discover some niche tracks as they play in the background. Just Shazam it and you'll find a track that you'll love in an instant.
* SoundCloud: It was the dominant streaming platform of the late 2010s and early 2020s, building the careers of the likes of Juice WRLD, The Kid LAROI, and Lil Uzi Vert. Try searching on some genre-specific hashtags or type nonsense into the searchbar to find something good.
* YouTube: You can easily find music on YouTube just by either searching up a song title or watching videos of old songs from the 80s that were hits either in the US or elsewhere.
* Music publications: Websites like Stereogum and Pitchfork and their critiques on albums, whether it be negative or positive, can help you form an acquired taste that appeals to the likes of hipsters.
* Non-mainstream/US radio: If you're tired of hearing ""Lose Control"" many times a day, then try listening to college radio or international pop radio. It can lead you to good alt-rock and college rock or niche pop music that barely became a hit on another side of the Atlantic.

These are some ways to find a good tune without relying on Spotify's algorithm. But what about platforms that you could use instead of Spotify? Sure, there's Apple Music, but what if you aren't reading this post on an IPhone or a Macbook? Here are some non-Apple alternatives to Spotify:

* Deezer
* Tidal
* Qobuz
* The aformentioned SoundCloud
* Bandcamp
* YouTube
* YouTube Music
* LastFM

And that's all I can put here! Thoughts? And what are some other alternatives to the Spotify algorithm?",3,1765626892.0,popheads,5,0.58,False

Would only drink at the weekends. And there were never any full black out sessions when I was around. And he never got behind the wheel again while drinking. I did all the driving.

2 weeks ago he started his winter job. This involves heavy equipment, public field ect. We both work in the same industry and I so happened to turn up in his work place Friday afternoon. I stopped in to say hello and could immediately smell the rum cream in his coffee. So I asked him for a sip cause I was dry, he tried to say no. I took the cup from the table and sipped it. Sure enough it was coffee with rum cream. I kinda pulled him a look sat the cup back down and walked out. I went straight to his pick up truck and it had an open 36 pack of beer and an empty 8 pack. Plus an empty bottle of rum cream. He stood and watched me from the door as I looked in his truck. I shot him a look and shook my head!.

Coming to Saturday morning he has yet to talk about it. Refuses to try and hold any conversation with me to any extent. I haven’t brought it up just yet. But I need some advice on how to deal with this.

I cannot believe a year has passed and we're still able to stay in-touch, even with the distance introduced to our post-college living circumstances. While apart, I have become more grateful for what I had - you. I think back to all the times we had our growing moments. I was constantly reminded of my worth and time dedicated to certain activties and people. You expedited those growing pains! (Haha) Outside the window of work, I was also learning how to be more organized with myself, as I balanced between work and relationships. After meeting you and getting very close in the beginning, I was learning how amazing of a person you were, but the more time spent I knew you were a keeper. Throughout this year, my mind replayed all our memories together - from exploring every squarefoot within the city of Philadelphia to traveling in other states across the north east. My favorite time throughout college had to be during the Paoli era, where we got a taste of life together. Coming to see you after long work days made me look forward to 'life' living w you. That experience was as fruitful on our 3rd coop. That time taught me that distance was possible with someone who was worth it after being together enough. 

Back in our earlier phases, my favorite moments had to be us exchanging dialogue in some serious conversations at the park in powelton or more entertaining ones about the unique aspects in our cultures and lifestyles (especially diet), which have made me more of an adaptable, open-minded person and partner. You know, when we first met, I hated coffee. I think back to when I first ordered that American at GfG with you and it tasted so bitter, but I kept my composure to try and impress because I knew you liked coffee. Now I've grown to like this bitter taste. Another fond memory was during our first date at the arcade - I'll never forget you wacking the pop up things with such a cute expression yet forceful execution. 

As the year comes to an end, I think back to that cold wintery night in New York, where we steadily treaded back to the apartment in an abrupt snow storm. Despite how that turned out, I would still go back and do them again with you from each leisurely moment to life impacting event. All these memories remind me of how much I enjoyed every second together- and more to come... but I still want us to work and get married.

The last thing to get off my chest, and please God, I hope someday you let us find eachother again where the circumstances and timing are right because I absolutely love you P.",1,1765626110.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
1pljezn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amazontly/comments/1pljezn/how_has_the_digital_kitchen_scale_evolved_recently/,How has the digital kitchen scale evolved recently?,"Kitchen technology keeps getting better, and digital kitchen scales have come a long way in the past few years. If you're still using that old scale from five years ago, you might be surprised at what's available now.

**Better Accuracy Than Ever**

Modern digital kitchen scales can measure down to 0.1 grams or even 0.01 grams in some cases. This matters when you're baking bread, measuring coffee, or following recipes that need exact amounts. The sensors inside these scales have improved a lot, giving you consistent readings every time you weigh something.

**Smart Features You'll Actually Use**

Recent models come with features that make cooking easier. Many digital scales now have nutritional tracking built right in. You can weigh your food and see calories, protein, carbs, and fat without opening an app or searching online. Some scales connect to your phone through Bluetooth, letting you save measurements or follow along with recipe apps.

The displays have gotten better too. You'll find larger, backlit screens that you can read from any angle. Some even have displays that pull away from the base, which helps when you're weighing something in a big bowl.

**Tare Function and Multiple Units**

Almost every digital kitchen scale now includes a tare button that zeros out the weight of your bowl or container. This wasn't standard on older models. You can also switch between grams, ounces, pounds, and milliliters with one button press. This makes it easy to follow recipes from different countries without doing math in your head.

**Charging and Battery Life**

Newer scales often come with rechargeable batteries instead of those coin batteries that always died at the worst time. Some models even charge through USB-C cables, the same one you probably use for your phone. Battery life has improved too, with many scales lasting months on a single charge.

**Better Materials and Design**

Today's scales use tempered glass, stainless steel, and waterproof coatings. They're easier to clean and look good sitting on your counter. Many are slimmer and lighter than older models, but they can still handle heavier items, often up to 11 or 22 pounds.

If you're ready to upgrade your kitchen setup, check out the latest options at [this collection of digital kitchen scales](https://athomewave.com/digital-kitchen-scale). You'll notice the difference right away when you start using one for your cooking and meal prep.

**Why Upgrade Now?**

You don't need to spend a fortune to get these new features. Prices have actually gone down while quality has gone up. Whether you're into baking, meal prepping, portion control, or just want accurate measurements for cooking, a modern scale makes things simpler.

The old spring-loaded scales or basic digital ones from years back just can't compete with what's out there now. When you're serious about getting your recipes right or tracking what you eat, precision matters. Plus, these newer models last longer and work better than the budget options from the past.

Ready to see what's new? Head over to [browse current digital kitchen scale models](https://athomewave.com/digital-kitchen-scale) and compare features, prices, and reviews. Your cooking will get more consistent, and you'll wonder why you waited so long to upgrade.",1,1765625894.0,Amazontly,0,1.0,False

We’ve been together for around a year and a half. I have now figured out that there were multiple instances in which he lied to me. This is gonna be extremely long and messy as a very heated conversation happened last night and i’m still pretty lost. I apologise in advance. One thing to address is that during the first days we met, he told me he thought following exes and ex situationships was really weird and immature. 

First of all, he lied about his ex girl best friend, i’ll call her N. A year and a half ago, when we first started to get to know each other, he told me that he had a girl best friend and asked if that was gonna be a problem. I answered no, i also had a guy best friend and then asked him if he ever had feelings for her. He said no, I believed him and that was it. After around a month I got around to meeting N and we immediately hit it off and became close friends as well. That was ,up until March 2025 when they broke it off, seemingly for no serious reason, just that she got a bf (who she met through my bf) and kinda forgot about about her friends. Around 2 months after that, he was talking about her in a sad, reminiscing sort of way and I again asked if he ever had feelings for her. His answer changed and he said he did use to have a crush on her a few years ago when they met but it was parodic and that nothing ever happened between them.

Secondly, the younger sister of one of his friends. I was hanging around with him and two of his friends one day during the first months of our relationship and it came up during the conversation that he had a one time thing with the younger sister of one of them. After the friends left, I asked how long ago this was. It was around 6 months before we met. What weirded me out was that he would have been 22 and she would have been around 17 at that time. He admitted that it was wrong for several reasons but that it happened and it was a one time thing. I still felt weird and couldn’t shake it off. I ended up finding her in his following, and also that he would occasionally like her stories. Some of them with her face in them. I brought this up to him, he seemed apologetic, he said that he didn’t remember liking her stories but maybe he did it on “auto pilot” without understanding who she was. He unfollowed her practically instantly and i felt a bit more comfortable. 

Thirdly, a friend of N. Around June-July 2025 he told me he replied to a song that a girl posted on her notes. I asked him how come he’d do that, and he told me she was a friend of N, he’d met her a few times, he always thought they had similar interests and believed they could be friends. He asked if i had a problem with that, i asked him if he ever had feelings for this girl and he said no, so i said it was okay. After a couple days he told me he wanted to ask her to go for a coffee and asked me if it was gonna seem weird. I told him that yes, it probably would be weird given that him and N don’t talk anymore and that he hasn’t even been talking to this girl for more than a few days. From my understanding, at one point she left him on read and they never talked again. Later on I found out that not only did he have feelings for her, they also arranged to go out (before we met), and N would fix them up. This was a few months before he met me. So he lied to me about not liking her, and he wanted to ask this girl he used to be into to go for a coffee. Wtf?

Then there’s E. Not much to say about her, one day he told me that a friend of his was gonna hook up with this girl, E, and that my bf knew her because they used to go out, my bf saw her very seriously but she led him on. Once again, I went to his following and found her.  A few days later I asked him why he would still have her in his following after all that, he said he never cared enough to unfollow her, which is weird considering how clear he was that following exes was not okay. This was around October and by last night when we fought, he still 

hadn’t unfollowed her. 

Finally, there’s K. From my understanding, he and K where good friends, they made out one night a few years ago, said it was a mistake and that they wouldn’t let it ruin their friendship, but their friendship was inevitably ruined. I also found her in his following. When i learned about her, i asked him if they ever communicated and he said no. I would later find out that this is not completely true, as 2 months after we started dating he replied to a story of hers and tried to strike up conversation. Then a year later, this past October, he texted her to congratulate her on a significant milestone in her life. 

We’re on semi-long distance, as i go to uni around 2 hours away. Last night i was out with friends and got a bit tipsy, and on my way home from the bar I called him and started telling him all this and asked him why he lied. He never seemed to have a good answer, only that he didn’t technically lie, that he thought these were unimportant etc. At one point in the call I started crying and I was a real mess. I hung up on him and went home. I’m roommates with my brother (who’s also in uni) in a very small house and didn’t want to wake him. We texted a bit and he apologised multiple times, said he unfollowed all of them, told me he didn’t wanna lose me over something so stupid and asked me what i needed. I told him I needed space and that i would be back in my hometown on Thursday. He asked me if i was saying that because i wanted to end things with him irl. I didn’t reply. He said he wanted to drive over and see me, to explain everything because he really didn’t want to lose me. He said he’d bring his phone and we’d go through it together. I said i didn’t care for that, i cared for the lies. He told me he’d give me space and to tell him when i wanted to speak to him again. I’m extremely heartbroken right now and don’t know what to do.

Trying to figure out what that says about me.,"I’m posting this because I’m still trying to figure out what happened and want some outside perspective.

Earlier that day, I had an argument with my boss over something a colleague messed up, but I ended up getting blamed. Then the coffee dispenser didn’t work, and I accidentally burned my hand trying to get it to work. The traffic was terrible that day too. My usual route suddenly stopped at a terminal I didn’t expect, and there was bridge work I didn’t know about. All that stacked up.

Later, the chocolate incident happened. A bunch of chocolates fell. They were still wrapped and some went to the dust pan. I could’ve just cleaned them and moved on.

Instead, I snapped.

Instead of picking up the ones that didn't get to the dust pan that was dusty, I threw all of them into the dustpan, mixed them with dust, stepped on them, flattened them, and threw everything into the trash. No one got to eat any of it. Not me, not anyone else. Those weren’t cheap either chocolates either. The whole box was like $20 and I kept saying it didn’t matter to me. My parents were furious.

I didn’t just act out of anger. I did it deliberately. I made sure they were unrecoverable. I wanted people to get mad. I wanted to see the reaction. And when it happened, I felt relief. I didn’t feel bad in that moment. And I just slept the whole day.

This isn’t the first time. Something similar happened before with pizza. At that time, I also had a bad day, traffic, super long lines in the grocery store, other rude people like me, then when I got home, I was going to take a bite of a pizza and then It fell, and instead of salvaging it, I threw everything away. Same response.

Once things cooled down, I started questioning myself. It didn’t feel like it was about the food or the money. It felt like I needed control, and ruining something gave me that release.

I’m not trying to justify it. I know it wasn’t okay. I just want to understand the pattern before it turns into something worse.

I have to then re-start it to estimate the amount of extra coffee I actually need to get a half decent coffee.  This isn't a question of dialing it in.  Changing the grind setting or changing the cone grind setting seems to just make very little difference.

I went to my work christmas party which is an hour away for me. I partied till 3 AM and woke up around 8. I had a strong coffee, food an an ipurofen and I was fine.

Fast forward I was on the highway and suddenly I thought „damn, that’s a lot of traffic“ and suddenly everything felt too much. The cars beside me, behind me, in front of me. My hands were shaking and got sweaty and it felt like I couldn’t feel my feet or my arms. For everyone who knows the Autobahn in Germany, they know that the usual speed is around 120 km/h which didn’t help with my panic attack. I took a few deep breaths, dug my fingernails into my legs in hope that I get some feeling back and it helped a little bit but I felt like my body was disassociating. So I called my colleague who is also my best friend and asked her if she could stay on the phone with me and just talk because my mind was spiraling. 

I’m so glad that she was there because I don’t think I would have made it back home without her.

God, I fucking hate this. I hope this isn’t a setback..

I have friends, but they all have partners and are super busy with their lives, we have to plan stuff well in advance, there is no spontaneity, for that reason I just end up doing most of the stuff solo.  

I have only ever been on a handful of dates. I enjoyed most of them. In those moments I wished they lasted longer, I genuinely enjoyed the conversations, the banter, the warmth of holding their hand, walking/exploring new parts of the city together, but I also knew that those moments were temporary and regardless of what I did or said, I won't see them again.

  
I haven't been on a date in a long time now and often find myself daydream on occasions wishing I could rewind time back to just before I went on a date with that cute girl, not that it would change anything but that I enjoyed those moments so much that I want to experience them again and again. Whenever I see young a couple at the beach, in the city, while travelling, social media, even grocery store, it makes me super jealous and feel like an absolute loser and wishing that I could swap lives with them, even if it was for a day, just to experience and feel something that I never had a chance to.

I just came back from the beach after a swim, it was amazing and I was happy. It was late afternoon with the sun setting, I saw so many couples walking on the beach, having picnics, barbecuing, cycling and it put me in such a terrible mood. I came back home, curled up in bed and just cried.

We as humans are social creatures, there is no way to stop desiring for love and connection, I have tried to cut out social media, not go out on the weekends and socially isolate myself, but it just doesn't work. If there was a way to remove the part of the brain that seeks romantic connection and love, I would be the first person in line, even if that meant paying $100k for the surgery.

1plj63x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/1plj63x/fascinating_experience_with_social_engineering_at/,Fascinating experience with social engineering at Target,"So, I have a new baby. New babies mean diapers. (I know, I know, cloth diapers—we're still trying to figure that one out, okay?)

Where I live, the best place to buy diapers when factoring both time and cost is Target, so even though I don't like shopping at the Red Circle Slavery Store, off to Target I went. But it was a wild experience walking through the store. I had a set list of things I needed: *diapers, toilet paper, toothpaste.* Nothing else. And yet as I walked through the store searching for these items, I observed myself having several reactions:

1.) ""Man I just want a coffee. The Starbucks smells so good—no, wait, they're on strike."" It's right there by the doors the moment you walk in, and it looks so festive and warm and inviting after being out in the biting cold. If there hadn't been an invisible picket line I didn't want to cross, I absolutely would have gotten myself a ""little treat,"" even though I don't have the money for it.

2.) The ambience is just so warm and friendly. I felt so *happy* walking around aisles of cheaply made crap. I felt homey and soothed. By a business I *know* is trying *to rip me off.*

3.) The baby items. Anyone else notice how if you're coming through the front of the store on the fastest route, you have to walk past all the cute clothes and toys and convenience items before you get to the necessities like the diapers? I almost bought my baby two new onesies before sternly telling myself that I can get them at the secondhand store for half the price.

4.) The clothes. It was so tempting, in spite of everything I know about Target. Part of it is that my personal style is currently considered fashionable for like the first time in my life, but still. It would all have looked so good on me, and it was *all so cheap.* I had to keep reminding myself that all this stuff is cheap because it's made by slavery, and that ""just one cute sweater"" is not an acceptable reason to capitulate. I know how this stuff gets made, I have a prior commitment to buying similar stuff at a better quality, I *have* similar stuff at home of better quality already, and *I still wanted to buy it.*

5.) The mannequins. Okay. Let's start with a little reminder that I have a new baby. Like most new mothers, I'm a little insecure about my body right now, but I usually do a good job of not letting it get to me.

However. All the mannequins are of these tiny little slip-of-a-thing women. And looking at those thin faux women in their cute outfits that are exactly my style, I literally heard the thought go through my head of, *""God I'm so fat now. Maybe if I buy that outfit I'll look cute again like her.""*

I literally stopped myself dead in the aisle with my mouth hanging open. I'm *never* that harsh on myself or my body at home. But here in the store, I felt so so shitty about myself for not looking like a mannequin that *I didn't even look like when I was a teenager!* It's literally impossible for me to look like that, my body type wouldn't match the mannequin even if I lost a dangerous amount of weight. I know all that logically, and yet it *still* got to me. I can't speak for men because I'm not one, but I have to imagine that guys feel something similar walking past all those male mannequins who are Tall and Toned and Outdoorsy and Have A Plastic Six Pack. I'm certain that the insecurity itself is part of the marketing strategy, not just to make their clothes look good but to make you feel *bad.*

**All this to say,** the social engineering of Target is like...evil genius levels, and it was wild to watch it happening to me in real time. It's the perfect combination of soothing homeyness and insecurity. The whole place is practically whispering to you, *""You're not measuring up—as a mother, as an employee, as a woman—but it's okay girl, we've got you. Just buy our extremely affordable products (don't ask why they're so cheap), and everything will be okay.""*",93,1765624953.0,Anticonsumption,12,0.9,False

Since I moved here many of my views have changed. This city lets homeless people do whatever they want, people smoke crack openly and nothing happens. I had crack smoke blown in my face while walking to the coffee shop. The encampments are beyond dangerous and I drive by them everyday. They smell like burning plastic and toilets. These people need help, not to be given things likea place to put needles (they won’t use it if they are literally fine with shitting within view of a car, I have also seen this.) I used to be a social worker. There are a lot of programs for people and while you have to fill out paperwork and it takes time, there are resources. 

This city, along with many people in it, are the most performative people i have ever met. If these people who you want to keep encampments and “love people who use drugs” actually lived by it they wouldn’t be saying these things. Homeless people have dumped shit in my apartment hallway and patio since I have moved here. It’s getting worse. Homeless(drug users) need help and are not going to decide for help because they are already at the lowest of low - living in an encampment and shitting on the street. They aren’t thinking straight because OF THE DRUGS. It won’t get better unless they get help, if they don’t want it at least make encampments illegal and it will make it harder for people to gather. Encampments (CITY encampments) are for drug users. Real encampments are hidden. 

Everyone I meet is obsessed with defending encampments. It’s a joke, they don’t live by them. If they did they wouldn’t. I care about people, I do not want them to die or be treated bad. But this is out of control here. If you care about a friend who is an addict on the verge of dysfunction or dying, you would do something right? Not just give them a needle bucket and a place to do drugs??? Why are people just performing here??

My partner (38m) has two kids (16,12). We have been together for just over a year now. We used to be in a polygamous relationship. So it was me (22f), my partner, his (ex)fiancé (mother of kids). Him and his ex fiancé were together for 16 years.

Skipping a load of trauma dumping but now it’s just me and my partner, and ex fiancé has blocked me (genuinely no idea why, I didn’t notice for two months until my partner told me, that’s how little I contact her.) Him and his fiancé broke up 4 months ago. And I’m really struggling on what a normal relationship between ex’s with kids together looks like?

He wants to go round, and have family dinners etc regularly without me (not just on special occasions) just with her and the kids. He wants to talk to her and go out for coffee and hang out with her. And I’m just not comfortable with any of that? But I’m not sure if I’m just being stupid and jealous for feeling that way. I don’t want him to have any contact with her at all but I know that’s not an option due to the kids and I would never ask that for him. I know how important being able to coparent is. I just don’t know where I stand on setting boundaries.

((Edit:) for more context, we are hoping to move to a house that can accommodate me, my partner and his kids in July. A scenario he has brought up has been “what if the kids don’t want to come over to our house though? Or if they want to see me and not you? I still want to be able to see them” to which I responded, I will leave the house and stay somewhere else while you have that time with the kids.

1plivoo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1plivoo,The Adventures of the Mud Queen — Episode 11: “Snow Queen on the Internet”,"By now, it was officially impossible for Lila Bellyton to go anywhere without someone whispering, pointing, or quietly lifting a phone.

“That’s her.”
“The Mud Queen!”
“Do the pose!”

And Lila?
She still laughed every time.

The internet hadn’t moved on. If anything, it had doubled down. The pose—arms raised, tongue out, unapologetically silly—had become shorthand for embracing chaos. People did it with spilled coffee, fallen groceries, dropped phones, broken umbrellas. Someone even did it next to a collapsed snowman with the caption:
“Honoring the Queen.”

Lila had long stopped pretending she was embarrassed.

> “Sometimes the messiest moments make the best memories,”
she reminded herself—now printed on mugs, hoodies, and at least one very questionable tote bag.




---

When Accidents Become a Business

The biggest twist came from her friend Mia Cornell.

What started as casual photos—“Just stand there, Lila,” “Okay now laugh,” “Don’t wipe that off yet”—had turned into something else entirely. Mia had leaned fully into content creation. Her accounts exploded. Brands called. Campaigns followed.

And somehow, without ever meaning to, Lila had become the star.

“She’s authentic,” Mia told one sponsor.
“She’s chaos,” Sophie added helpfully.
“She’s relatable,” Tina said, nodding seriously.

Before Lila knew it, she was the face of:

cozy winter drinks

washable sweaters

stain-resistant jeans

and one extremely proud detergent brand


They were making real money.

Lila stared at her phone one evening and blinked.
“Wait… I’m getting paid for being messy?”
Mia grinned. “You’re getting paid for being yourself.”


---

A Snowy Invitation

That weekend, winter arrived properly.

The streets were layered in thick, powdery snow. The kind that made everything quieter. Softer. Dangerous.

Lila, Mia, Sophie, and Tina bundled up and headed to Laurie’s apartment, arms full of snacks, hot chocolate mix, and an unspoken understanding that something would probably go wrong.

Laurie opened the door beaming.
“You made it! And you survived the influencer life!”
“I miss anonymity,” Lila joked. “But not enough to give it back.”

Then came a small blur of energy.

“LILA!”
Dolly, Laurie’s niece, charged toward her like a tiny snow-powered missile.

“You’re the Mud Queen!” Dolly announced proudly.
Lila gasped. “I’ve been recognized by royalty.”


---

Snowball Diplomacy Fails Immediately

Outside, the snow was pristine. Untouched. Innocent.

Dolly stared at it with the seriousness of a scientist about to make history.
“We’re making a snowman,” she declared.
“And throwing snowballs,” Sophie added.
“And filming content,” Mia said, already holding up her phone.

Lila sighed. “Of course.”

It started gently. Rolling snow. Stacking snowballs. Laughing. Tina tripped over nothing and blamed gravity. Everything was peaceful for exactly three minutes.

Then Dolly threw the first snowball.

It missed everyone.

The second one did not.

It hit Lila square in the stomach and exploded into white powder.

Everyone froze.

Slowly, Lila looked down at the snow dusting her sweater and jeans.

Mia whispered, “Don’t you dare wipe that off.”

Lila didn’t.

She raised her arms.
Stuck out her tongue.
And struck the pose.

Dolly screamed with joy.
“That’s it! That’s the face!”


---

The Snow Queen Is Crowned

From there, chaos took over.

Snowballs flew. Tina slipped and fell dramatically. Sophie laughed so hard she dropped her phone—which Mia filmed. Someone’s scarf became part of the snowman. Someone else became part of the snowman.

At some point, Dolly placed a tiny glittery toy crown on Lila’s head.

“You’re not just the Mud Queen,” Dolly said solemnly.
“You’re the Snow Queen now.”

Lila sat down on the freshly packed snowbank, snow coating her belly and jeans, crown crooked, hair full of flakes. She looked ridiculous.

And happy.

Mia zoomed in.
“This is going to do numbers,” she whispered.


---

Viral, Again (Obviously)

By Sunday night, the video was everywhere.

“The Mud Queen Evolves into the Snow Queen.”
“Proof that winter is just messier autumn.”
“Sometimes the messiest moments make the best memories.”

Comments poured in:

She never looks embarrassed.

I want her confidence.

Why does snow look fun again?


Lila watched the video curled up on Laurie’s couch, Dolly asleep beside her, snow still melting from her boots.

She smiled.

“I never planned any of this,” she said quietly.
Mia nudged her. “That’s why it works.”


---

Epilogue

Later that night, Lila stepped outside one last time. The street was quiet. Snow fell gently. No cameras. No audience.

She scooped up a handful of snow, tossed it into the air, and laughed when it fell right back onto her sweater.

She didn’t pose this time.

She didn’t need to.

Because the Mud Queen wasn’t about mud.
Or snow.
Or spills.

She was about laughing when life got messy—and realizing that sometimes, those moments were exactly the ones worth remembering.

1pliv1n,https://v.redd.it/rc7ahobwdy6g1,Alex Telma- 2025 American Open Finals,"135-138-140X. Plenty of Haribo Gummi bears. 172-182-190

His previous Comp PR was 131 with a 169 C&J in April. 138&182 were recent PR's in training and he smoked a 180 Rack Jerk in the spring. He's played with 215&220 FS up to the meet but we haven't really tested BS since summer besides for 5 reps. He had gotten spit up by 187 a few times.

Because of his fall schedule and some life events, we opted not to have him compete in Aug-October though he did some drop in heavy days in Boston, Strengthworks in StLouis, and Milwaukee Barbell. 

He weighed in a bit light on Saturday and being in transit didn't get anything to eat so we stopped at IHOP after midnight because he has some issues getting a car from Orlando on a late flight. French toast, hash browns, eggs and something else I think and we really needed to hit the sack.

I brought my scale which I checked against the meet scale so we knew what he weighed after IHOP and still had room. Instead of waking up for breakfast early on Sunday to go to breakfast somewhere, he slept in and we hit 7/11 for some eats and energy drinks/coffee/snacks.

Still weighed in under (at over 6'2"").

Declared 130 to start Snatches but bumped it to 135 though that was problematic leading up on the taper. 140 denied him again.

I had him never met or seen him lift in person until the weekend 😆

We were gonna open low to clinch the QT for Nationals and the original plan was to hit 182 and take 187 for a ride. Apparently he told his brother 140/190 that morning.😆

So 190 really came out of nowhere. Crazy. 

We've got some work to do for Nationals and maybe the Arnold? 

He did Bench 140 on Tuesday besides giving 250 a ride for a BS. Basically he's gonna chill through Xmas with some well deserved time off.

I've got one more lifter to post from Saturday when she gets me her edited lifts. 😏

No commute, no random office small talk, I could wear whatever, eat when  I wanted, take quick breaks without feeling watched. I set up a small desk in my bedroom, got a decent chair, even bought a cheap lamp so it felt more “official.” For the first few months  my productivity actually went up, I was calmer and way less drained by the end of the day. I kept telling friends this is how work is supposed to feel, like why would anyone ever want  to go back. 

The thing I wasn’t ready for was how fast my brain  stopped separating work and life. It started small, checking Slack on my phone while making coffee, answering one email after dinner because “it’ll only take a minute.” Then my laptop started living on the couch with me, and I’d open it again at like 9pm just to “get ahead.” No  one was asking me to do this either, which is the scary part. It was just this low level feeling that I could always do a bit more since I’m already home anyway. I didn’t even notice it happening until I realized I hadn’t fully shut off in weeks, even weekends felt kinda guilty. 

Now I’m in this weird spot where remote work is still better in a lot of ways, but it quietly trained me to be always available  and I hate that. I miss the hard line of leaving an office and knowing the day is done, even if the office itself sucked. I’m trying to reset things now, no work apps on my phone, laptop stays at the desk, actual lunch breaks, but it’s harder then I expected because the temptation is literaly right  there.

My office has a handful of doctors and a couple midlevels. We have your usual 5 MAs, few nurses, and back/front office staff.

This is my second year of practice here and I busted my ass with RVUs to get paneled until now. The harder I work, the harder my MA works as well, and I told myself I could be generous to others when I “made it”. Well, my RVU settlement this year turns out is 400k above my base salary (I busted a little too much ass and am backing down). I want to compensate her for her hard work and support too, since my organization kind of screws and underpays MAs. She does help cover other providers when I’m not in, and sometimes double covers someone else or shares double covering, but she is assigned to me and is the one who does my inbasket.

Every year the docs pay for a holiday dinner where everyone dresses up and we do a $20 white elephant, and we usually give each staff member $100-150 in a gift card. Historically each doc also gave their own MA some kind of present, could be just a card or something small like chocolates. I can’t remember if we had equalized that part last year. My staff is also pretty gossippy and are best friends outside of work and absolutely would tell each other what their docs gifted.

My question is- would it be weird for me to compensate her in some kind of scale to my bonus? Like give her a $1000 Amazon gift card? She also likes a particular brand of coffee maker system so I could also do something like get her a $500 gift card to that store….

**Chapter 19: Save The Child!**

I woke up because of damn Mejni, who was pulling my tie. Well, the first day of catastrophic events ended with me having a little bit of strain on my right foot. It was a bad idea to do the last small jump with only my right foot, but we were still alive. I decided to rest in the shade of a tree, but it was night. I was a little curious about how they controlled night and day here; it must be some experiment that worked. They should share it with Earth so we do not have to depend on the real sun in about a million years.

Something not far away from us was burning in a circle. It had lit up the whole area around the three, as if it wanted us to notice it. I got up and moved forward to check it out, with Mejni climbing up on my head. I am too tired to fight with the Cat right now. As we came closer, the fire changed colour to purple and a text appeared above it.

""Box?""

Nothing happened, so it wasn't the second stage.

""Gandrael?...Book?""

Nothing, did the book break after a while when we entered the world? The text above it was just three words: 'Save the child!'

""Cat! Do you know what it is?""

""Nho!""

""I wonder if this is a request from Gandrael, or maybe the book is broken. It does look like a portal, but it is pitch black inside the circle."" I said, forgetting I was talking with myself because Mejni isn't a coffee buddy you take with you when you want to discuss something. A wall is probably better to take with you when commenting, as it is quiet, rather than giving you jibberish answers.

I took down Mejni from my head as he stared at the portal, and I threw him at the center of the circle, but he hit his head and fell on the grass, bouncing back to me.

""Oh shit! I miscalculated, I thought you were going to go through it!"" I tried explaining to him as his eyes turned red again, and he attacked me when two hands came up from the ground and pulled me down, with Mejni holding my blazer.

The pitch-black darkness turned to woods around me, and I looked around. We were definitely not in the same place. Mejni released my blazer as his eyes returned to black while we watched the surroundings. The question was not where we were; the question was which woods we were in. I did not recognize the woods from home. Something was scrambling in the bushes, and I hurried to get up when a little girl in a maid's outfit came out. She looked like the one I fought in the classroom, but this one looked like a four- or five-year-old.

""Elloh!"" She said, smiling at us.

""Hey! What is your name, little girl?"" I tried asking by raising my hand with a big smile.

She put her hand on her chest and answered:

“Me, Me, Shtella!”

""Ah, Stella! My name is Berk, and the Cat is Mejni.""

""Cam, Met Mameh, Papeh!"" She said and started walking on one of the paths.

Mejni climbed onto my shoulder, and I turned to look at him as he smiled at me with his eyes closed.

""You are climbing up on my shoulder so you can use me as a shield, aren't you?""

He kept smiling, the bastard, playing it safe. If we get hit, I will take the whole damage while he can jump off my shoulder. The little girl turned around and lifted her hand at us.

“Cam, Cam!”

After following her for a while on the path, we came out to a village. The definition of low-budget was really in full-on mode here. There were several huts and a couple of cabins in a half circle out in the middle of the woods with a bigger road leading away from the village. Stella went into one of the cabins, and we followed her.

Inside, a woman was setting up the table with wooden plates; well, everything was wood. Mejni jumped off me and attacked a Melon in the basket.

""Oh my! I suppose the little one was thirsty."" The woman commented, continuing, ""Who is the stray that my daughter has brought home this time?""

I scratched the back of my head, and I felt it was a little bit awkward.

""Hi, ma'am! I am Berk, the one eating the melon is Mejni.""

She smiled back at me and said:

""Do not worry, Berk! You are not the first stowaway she has brought home. Please, make yourself comfortable and sit down at the table, join us for supper.""

Supper...haha! That is such a British, hm...Are we in England or maybe Ireland? Nah... can be Scotland, too, but she doesn't have a Scottish accent. Not the Irish either, perhaps the maid is from England, but her hair is way too dark, more like black. Can it be that her mother is maybe from England? I wonder where her father is from. I felt a breeze on my neck, and it didn't stop, so I turned around and stared at someone's chest. I had a feeling I wasn't one of the strong citizens in this village when I got my ass kicked by a ten-year-old. Looked up and saw a man in his mid-40s staring down at me and growling with his red eyes. He pressed his pointing finger at my chest, and I backed away a couple of steps before he entered the cabin and sat down, engaging with Stella.

""Hahaha! You do not have to be scared of my husband. He does not say much, but he arrived a little earlier than usual. He must be really hungry today. Please, sit down, and I will get the burned potatoes.""

Burned potatoes, owaow! That just took the low-budget level beneath the trashcan level. Why does the Cat get melon, and I get burned potatoes?

I moved to the opposite side of the big guy as he stared at me like he was ready to go at any moment in a fight against me. Mejni climbed up on my shoulder and stretched out his whole body over my neck, covering both shoulders as if the bastard was going to take a nap.

""You and the Meerkat seem to be really close, are you family?"" The woman asked as she put the...burned potatoes on the table.

I gave her a smirk because I couldn't tell her that I wished she could cook him instead, so that I could get rid of him. The red-eyed guy would probably eat him without hesitation.

""Well, we meet on the road, so we are just traveling together for a while.""

""Kill!"" The red-eyed guy commented.

""Stop it, Tharfyl! I am so sorry about my husband; he has not eaten meat for a while. I think he was looking at your travel pet on your shoulders, and it made him miss it.""

Please, take him, cook him, kill him.

""Oh...Eh...Okay!""

""You have to beg my pardon for not introducing myself properly. My name is Magdalena Ven Kotte. The big man here is my husband, Tharfyl Ven Kotte, and the little one is Stella. Then there is her brother, also, but he is serving in the war right now as a soldier for the Demon Army.""

Of all the things I just heard, what stuck in my mind was Kotte, because Kotte means Cone in Swedish. So this is the Ven Cone Kotte family. Do not laugh, Berk. Do not laugh; hold it in.

""Oh! Is a war going on?"" That was close, good play, holding in your laughter.

""Yes, you were lucky Stella did not kill you both,"" Magdalena said.

Mejni woke up from his nap and leaned his upperbody on my head, like I was carrying a child on my shoulder. He probably got interested when she said that we were lucky not to be killed. Pfft! How is a four-year-old killing us? What a joke.

""Eh, kill us?""

Magdalena laughed, and the red guy looked like he was choking on a potato.

""Is he alright?"" I asked.

""Oh, yes! Do not worry. That is how he laughs, he was laughing at your surprised look."" She paused and then continued, ""Stella is half Demon and Half Witch. She did not show you her red eyes because you posed no threat.""

The red guy kept choking while I was stunned by the mother's comment, even if the child is half demon and half witch. It is still a child.

""Did she think we were too weak?"" I asked.

""Yes, that is correct!"" Magdalena answered.

The sound of something hitting the ground outside made the table bounce, shit, what the hell was that? A roar came from outside, and civilians were screaming. We all got up, and Magdalena grabbed Stella and gave her to me, and said with a serious look on her face:

""Keep her safe!""

Both of them ran out of the cabin, and it was chaos as parents tried to guide their children into the woods to get away. The sun disappeared for a moment as it grew dark, and I looked up to see black wings spread wide, covering the sun. A big foot was approaching the village when the couple with red and blue light used their powers to keep it from slamming down on the rest of the homes.

I took a couple of steps out onto the grass with Stella in my arms while Mejni rushed forward to try to help, but stopped when he realized we were completely useless against a giant monster of that size. The red and blue auras they were mounting out were saving many citizens, preventing the foot from destroying everyone's home.

""GO!"" Magdalena's scream echoed over the whole village. She was serious, the look in her eyes.

I nodded and started to stumble towards the woods, ignoring the pain in my right foot. When we were about to enter the woods, my body suddenly stopped, and I tripped back, noticing Stella's hands gushing with a black aura as she slowly got pulled towards Magdalena. I tried pulling her back with Mejni helping out in the front, but she kept floating above the grass towards her mother. I tried with all my strength, but she was way too strong for me when we came close up and were under the foot with both parents crying while doing everything in their power to hold up the foot. Stella's black aura in the air was leading to Magdalena.

""Witches who have a close bond with their mothers can connect in ways that are not possible for others. Take her to safety, please!"" She said, then started mumbling to herself.

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAGDALENA?"" I yelled to her.

Her eyes turned crystal blue as she swept her hand from left to right, and the black aura cut midway.

""I do not have any bond anymore with my daughter!""

I grabbed Stella and got my eyes a little bit watery as I hurried towards the woods and turned around to look at the parents when the foot slammed down, crushing them. Stella was crying and screaming after her mother, and I kept moving as far away as possible. Mejni climbed up on my shoulder when a portal just appeared from nowhere in front of me, and we passed through it.

I hit a wall and fell on my back, feeling the rocky ground, which made it a little painful. Someone grabbed me with red hands and pulled me up quickly as something with two horns and sharp, scary teeth was staring at me.

“Gran te Kvampan!” It said and pushed me back as I suddenly found myself in a row surrounded by strange creatures. Beside me was a girl with red eyes... wait a minute, that is Stella, and she was still wearing a maid outfit. Mejni zigzagged between several creatures and climbed up on my shoulders.

""Why do you interrupt the leader's speech?. Do you want to get thrown out of the camp?"" Stella angrily commented.

""Camp?""

""Yes, you idiot. We need to pass the camp as Demon soldiers for the army; that is why we are here.""

I looked around, and there was not a single human or human-looking individual except for Stella, but she wasn't even human.

After experiencing the intense and somewhat unbearable coffee notes in Followed by Kerosene and Elixir by Centauri Perfumes, I took a break from coffee-dominated fragrances. I recently sprayed Devotion completely blind, with no idea of the notes; I was intrigued. Devotion isn’t groundbreaking, but it offers a refreshing take on a mainstream masculine scent.

Devotion starts off with a distinct coffee note, but it is immediately muted by the sharpness of lemon. The lemon adds brightness to the composition, while the coffee and patchouli create an earthy yet clean aroma.

I don’t know how popular this fragrance is, as it doesn’t follow the usual sweet, vanillic trend of most designer scents. I suspect if this had been released by a brand like Masque Milano, DS & Durga, Maison Crivelli, or Byredo, it would be more popular. I now need to get my nose on the Parfum version.

Save Me 🙏","Started Keto November 27th of 2025 and the issue is I'm feeling extremely fatigued (before you say electrolytes, continue reading) and sometimes tired, some brain fog but moments of mental clarity where my words flow like a magnificent waterfall. The pro I'm experiencing is less inflammation and I feel I have a bit more morning energy and feel lighter, but crash mid day and get weak. I'm male, 27, 6'5, 135lbs to date, before starting I was around 150lbs. According to BMI I am underweight which may be the issue. But please continue reading. I am super active, Pre-Keto I use to do cardio for 2 hours everyday, and on the weekend up to 4 hours on the elliptical. On Keto, I actually got more energy to do it even longer without even breaking a sweat, but now the fatigue is setting in. 

 I keep up on my Sodium, Potassium, and Magnesium, and Calcium (as keto can make you excrete water, before keto I was like 150lbs). I take collagen, multi vitamin, bone broth, you get the point. I eat healthy, and even before switching to keto, I was naturally low carb (maybe around 120g) and never drank soda or ate processed food. But my choices of food wasn't diversed. I keep net carbs at 20 or below, sometimes I creep up to 25. But I do HVAC, and have an active job. I am under some stress but have been working in that and this past week skipped the gym and cutting back on excessively working out and implementing more weights but not over doing it. 

I'm not sure if I have high cortisol or perhaps insulin resistance. But I have always preferred waking up early. My sleep is not the best, 5-7 hours according to my Garmin tracker. 

Up until going full keto, I jumped into fasting rather quickly than I should have. I'm talking 2-3 days. I'm not trying to loose weight but was doing it for clarity and health. My macro goals I set up on cronometer is 120g of protein, 140g of fat, and 20 net carbs. I set the calorie intake at 1800 but I don't refer to that. I just don't get hungry, but lately I have been needed to snack on a couple times throughout the day to restore energy. Usually on cheese or something fatty. Sometimes nuts. Recently got into Keto Chow to try and get more calories in. 

My glutes have also flattened out (think keto took them from me) or that's why I'm thinking my cortisol may be high since it's a sign, even though I have no belly whatsoever. As for insulin resistance I don't have skin tags or a dark spots and I don't crave carbs. I don't have any lab work, or know my blood glucose or ketones. 

- I stopped fasting, I normally don't eat breakfast but have coffee, heavy cream, and MCT oil on the morning. Where would you recommend me to start to address my fatigue? Am I still transitioning to burning ketones effectively? Or is there something else I should look at? I normally eat or get up close to protein goal, maybe 70-100g, and usually my fat is around that or a little less.

Need higher income but can’t moonlight and raises unlikely in the near future. Client relationship is good, but workload has expanded significantly. Getting interview invites but hesitant due to interviews and losing Athena’s safety net. Would love advice from ex-Athena EAs.

⸻

I’ve been an Athena EA for over two years, earning ~₱56K/month. I’m thinking about leaving Athena, but hesitating.

The main issue is the pay. I need to increase my income, but Athena doesn’t allow moonlighting, so taking on extra work isn’t an option. A few months ago, I asked my direct supervisor about the possibility of promotion, which would’ve helped income-wise, but there’s been no positive update yet.

Another reason I’m considering leaving is the workload. I like my client, they like and trust me, and I’ve only had this one client since joining Athena. I’ve never had performance issues, and their feedback has always been positive. However, scope of my work has expanded over time (new business, new ventures). I’m supporting multiple areas at once and providing full-spectrum support, which requires a lot of mental bandwidth and constant context-switching. At this point, I feel my compensation is no longer aligned with the mental load, which is also why I raised the possibility of a promotion.

Currently, I’ve been getting messages on LinkedIn and even direct emails about EA roles, but I’ve either declined or didn’t respond. The main reason me being an introvert and interviews having always been my weak spot. I don’t always come across as confident during interviews, though I’ve done well in my previous roles and I know I’d be a reliable EA. I get nervous more easily than I’d like (probably doesn’t help that I drink way too much coffee.)

Another thing holding me back is the safety net Athena provides. As a freelancer, clients can drop you anytime, and I can’t afford to lose income. With Athena, I know my client plans to keep me for the foreseeable future, and even if something changes, I’d be matched with another client.

If you’re a former Athena EA, how easy or hard was it to find clients after leaving? Was the higher pay worth giving up the security Athena provides? How did you transition without losing income. Did you line up a client first? How did you communicate your availability?

One more thing I’m struggling with: my client relies on me a lot, and I know it would be important for them to plan ahead if I decide to leave Athena. Should I tell them I’m considering it, even if nothing is final yet? Or is it better to wait until I’m more certain?",9,1765622189.0,buhaydigital,4,1.0,False

I (25f) have been contemplating leaving my “fiance“ (25m).

for context let me start this out by saying that I do love him and have loved him for years. we have been together for about 3 years now. we have 2 beautiful babies together. i however felt trapped. our oldest baby together was a surprise. I got pregnant on the IUD. and our youngest was conceived 4 months after our other baby was born. this was also due to a medication malfunction. my birth control and my post partum depression medication countered one another.

yes. we should’ve waited to have kids until we were together longer. I get that. but I am not big into abortions. I always felt that if you are adult enough to make them then you’re adult enough to care for them.

my whole entire pregnancy I felt like I was the only one to do anything. cook. clean. anything. and that followed into my second pregnancy as well.

even now. 6 months later I feel like I’m the only one who does anything. I was out of town for a few days. before I left I made sure I cleaned the kitchen spotless, the downstairs bathroom, the pantry, living room and upstairs bathroom. spotless. and I was bragging to my fiance how it only took me 4 hours to do all of that. he proceeded to tell me I was full of it. because he can’t do it in that time.

let me explain the reason why. he’s fucking lazy. he doesn’t do shit. I was gone for 4 days and came home to a sink full of fucking dishes that I asked why he didn’t at least wash those and his response was “well theyre in the sink”. like that fucking justifies not doing the dishes? like no shit i see them in the sink. why are they not being washed in the dishwasher? to which he tells me that he did do the dishes they’re in the dishwasher and he had to wait until the cycle was done to reload it. ok. tell me why the dishes in the dishwasher were literally the SAME DISHES I had loaded and washed 4 days before.… down to the damn bottles. like what? why? just why lie? he then tells me that it’s hard on him to clean and take care of a 1 and a half year old and a 6 month old. yeahhhh. well. I do it all of the time. he’ll also say things like he is going to clean when the kids go to bed. (never happens). as I am writing this I am staring at a pile of 15 dishes sitting on our bedroom dresser. (wish I was lying about this). 11 are plates and 4 are bowls. there is also 4 cups. that’s excluding my coffee cup. that is mine. all of these dishes are from when I was out of town!!!!

also. his only job other then to go to work is to do the laundry. all he has to do is wash it and dry it. (I hate going to the basement. I have very bad asthma and also bad anxiety from falling down stairs so many times in this apartment).

he never does it. I have to literally bitch and complain and then literally threaten to leave him for him to do it.

and even then he never brings it up for me to finish. for example. I just had to IRON 2 HAMPERS full of clothes due to them being wrinkled from sitting in the basement for so long.

i have made comments to him numerous times about “hey I cleaned this room it needs to stay this way” and he will say ok but then won’t do fucking anything to help me out.

not to mention the complete and utter lack of sleep I go without due to my two babies crying because they hate being with him. all he does is try to make them sleep all day long. ALL DAY LONG. I have to literally get onto our camera and call him and tell him to stop or to wake up and take care of them. I am just so sick of living like this and feel like I am at a loss.

when I bitched at him the one time and told him ”if I’m going to be the only one who does anything and cleans then what’s the point in us being together” he told me I was ‘over reacting and being stupid and that he does shit for us all of the time’. (he’s talking about going to the store and doing the grocery shopping. 🤣.

he also has told me that he goes to work and works and I don’t do anything at all.

what???? no

he also tries to have sex with me. and I won’t do it. which he then treats me like shit about. but I’m just not attracted to him anymore I’m pretty sure because of all of this that’s happening.

am I over reacting? am I being an asshole? or am I reasonably pissed at the whole situation?",1,1765622081.0,AmIOverreacting,20,0.67,False

“I’ve always thought of Josie as a sister. Please, don’t overthink this,” he insisted, his gaze unwavering as it locked onto mine. “But her reputation has suffered because of my actions. I have to step up and take responsibility.”

“So?” I asked, my voice steady, though my insides churned with confusion and anger.

“I’ll marry her—just on paper, mind you. Once she has the baby, I’ll divorce her and then marry you,” he declared, as if he were discussing a mere business transaction rather than the fragile fabric of our lives.

He leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to my forehead. “Don’t worry, Penelope. I’ll make it up to you, I promise.”

After a brief, heavy pause, he added, “Josie’s been suffering from terrible morning sickness lately. I really should go stay with her now.”

With that, he turned on his heel and walked away, not bothering to glance back.

I stood there, watching his figure fade into the horizon, feeling as if the ground had shifted beneath my feet. Slowly, I removed my engagement ring, the symbol of our love, and let it slip through my fingers into the trash, along with our engagement photos that now felt like haunting reminders of a future that would never come to pass.

\*\*\*

After ending the call, I began the painful process of packing.

As I surveyed the home I had lovingly decorated in anticipation of our life together, a chilling wave of emptiness washed over me.

Dominic Tucker and I had shared seven beautiful years. The photographs had been taken, the invitations were sent, and the banquet menu had been meticulously finalized. Everything was in place, all ready for the day that was supposed to mark the beginning of our forever.

Yet here I was, just one week before the wedding, discovering that he had been unfaithful.

I swallowed down the ache that threatened to consume me and pushed my suitcase toward the door when my phone buzzed insistently. It was Dominic.

“Josie wants mousse. Pick some up and bring it over,” he instructed, his tone casual as if he were asking for a cup of coffee.

“We’re at Hillside Villa. You know the way, right?”

A bitter laugh escaped my lips, laced with irony.

How could I not know? I had designed that villa as a birthday gift to myself, pouring my heart into every detail.

I had visited countless times, and every brick and every plant had been chosen with care.

But now, Dominic had turned it into Josephine Vaughn’s private retreat.

In the past, to evade the prying eyes of the paparazzi, he had used Hillside Villa as their secret rendezvous point.

I had expressed my discomfort about their clandestine meetings, but he had brushed my concerns aside, saying, “She’s the girl next door I grew up with. You’re being ridiculous.

“She’s like family. Even if she stripped naked in front of me, I wouldn’t feel a thing.”

Now, I understood that every word had been a deceitful lie.

“Are you almost here? Josie’s hungry,” Dominic texted again, the urgency in his message grating against my raw nerves.

He had always been so emotionally detached, as if nothing truly affected him.

It made me wonder—how could a man who struggled to tie his own ties possibly care for Josephine?

I hurried over with the mousse, but as I approached the door, I found myself unable to step inside.

Josephine appeared, dressed in chic, understated loungewear that only accentuated her effortless elegance. She smiled warmly, looping her arm through mine. “Come on in, Penny. We’ve been waiting for you.”

Acting every bit the gracious hostess, she poured me a glass of water. “Dom’s in the kitchen cleaning up.”

“I mentioned wanting something sweet, and he actually asked you to bring it over? He really needs to learn to be more considerate,” she remarked, a playful glint in her eyes.

Just then, Dominic strolled over, catching her last words.

“I’m not considerate? Who’s the one who kicks off the blanket every night, leaving me to pull it back over her?” he retorted, a rag in one hand and a clean white apron tied snugly around his waist.

This domestic, nurturing side of him was foreign to me; I had never seen it before.

Josephine bit her lip, a shy smile creeping onto her face. “You’re the one who insisted I move in here so you could take care of me. I’m not that spoiled.”

Dominic chuckled softly, a sound I once found endearing. “Come on, Josie. You can’t even take care of yourself. How are you supposed to take care of a baby?”

Then he turned to me, as if just realizing my presence.

“But Penny? She’s gentle, thoughtful, and sensible. I’m lucky to have her.”

Oh, so he still remembered that I was his fiancée?

I set the mousse on the coffee table, my heart heavy, and turned to leave.

“Don’t bother me with stuff like this again. Get a room if you have to. Oh, wait… you’ve already had,” I shot back, my words dripping with scorn.

That was the last straw for Dominic.

“Penelope, what’s your problem? Didn’t we already discuss this? You’re embarrassing me.”

I couldn’t help but smirk coldly, “You got another woman pregnant. Tell me, who’s really the one being embarrassed here?”

Josephine tugged at Dominic’s sleeve, her eyes wide and pleading. “Dom, please don’t fight because of me. This is my fault. I should’ve never come here. Then you two wouldn’t be arguing like this.”

Her eyes glistened with unshed tears, and Dominic’s expression darkened, a storm brewing behind his gaze.

“This isn’t on you, Josie. She’s the one being difficult.

“I told her marrying you is just a formality. It’s only right that I take responsibility. Yet she still acts like she’s the victim.”

His words pierced through me, sharp and unforgiving, like a knife to the heart.

I met his gaze, silence hanging between us like a heavy fog.

Josephine stepped closer, her voice trembling. “Penny, I’m so sorry. It’s all my fault. Please don’t be mad at Dom, okay?”

Suddenly, she bowed her head, her apology sincere. “I’m really sorry. Please forgive me.”

Dominic rushed to her side, concern etched on his face. “What are you doing, Josie? She doesn’t deserve that!

“What did I tell you? I’ve got your back. No matter what happens, I’ll handle it. Did you forget?”

He helped her up, then turned his glare towards me. “Apologize to Josie.”

My chest tightened, rage and hurt swirling within me. I wanted to scream, but no sound escaped my lips.

Tears streamed down my cheeks, betraying the strength I desperately tried to hold onto.

Seeing me cry, Dominic seemed to freeze, his cold demeanor faltering for just a moment, revealing a flicker of concern.

Then Josie gasped, clutching her belly. “It hurts… My belly… It really hurts…”

Panic washed over Dominic. “What’s wrong? Is it the baby?”

Ignoring their chaos, I turned to leave, desperate to escape the suffocating atmosphere.

But Dominic wasn’t about to let me go that easily. He caught up to me, his grip on my arm firm and unyielding. “Penelope, if you still want to marry me, go back and apologize to Josie.”

A cold laugh escaped my lips, bitter and laced with disbelief.

Yes, once upon a time, I genuinely wanted to marry him.

But not anymore.

I looked at him, my heart heavy with the weight of seven years of memories flashing through my mind. Then, in a voice that was soft yet resolute, I said, “Dominic, we’re done.”

# Conclusion

In that moment of clarity, I felt the shackles of my past dissolve, replaced by a sense of liberation I had long thought impossible. The years spent in a relationship built on half-truths and emotional detachment had left me hollow, but now, as I stood firm in my decision, a newfound strength surged within me. I no longer wished to be the woman waiting in the shadows, clinging to a love that had turned into a mere illusion. Dominic’s world was no longer mine; I had finally severed the ties that bound me to a future that had become a painful mirage. As I walked away, the tears that had fallen like rain began to dry, replaced by a determination to reclaim my life and forge a new path forward.

The echoes of our shared laughter and dreams faded into the background, replaced by the promise of self-discovery and healing. I envisioned a life where my heart could mend, where love would not be defined by betrayal or sacrifice. Each step away from Dominic and Josie felt like shedding a layer of skin, revealing the vibrant, resilient woman I was meant to be. In that moment, I understood that true love could not thrive in the shadows of deceit, and as I embraced my own worth, I knew that brighter days awaited me. The tears had fallen, but now, they served as a reminder of my journey—a journey toward a love that would honor my spirit, not diminish it.",1,1765622073.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

I’ve been in Whitefield for about half an year now and am still getting adjusted to the city. I enjoy playing TT and recently picked up reading. On the weekends, I’m down for coffee, brunch or just chilling with some online gaming

1plif2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/cafe/comments/1plif2n/i_curated_a_playlist_specifically_for_coffee_shop/,I curated a playlist specifically for coffee shop vibes (tested in real cafés),"Hey everyone,  
I’ve always struggled to find a playlist that works for a whole shift. Generic ""Chill Hits"" often have sudden loud pop tracks that disrupt the vibe, and pure ""Lofi"" can get monotonous after 2 hours.

I wanted something that sits perfectly in the background but adds a bit of class and good mood when you actually listen to it. I’ve been curating this list called **""Coffee Lounge""** for a while now and tested it in a few local spots here in Switzerland. The feedback from guests and staff was great, so I thought I’d share it here.

It’s a mix of **Cozy Indie, smooth Neo-Soul, and warm Downtempo**. Consistent volume, no aggressive drops.

Hope it helps you get through your next shift or makes your shop vibe better!

And if the machine have 20-30 minutes auto turn off its much more frustrating.
I use this ""robot"" to press power button 30 min before my morning coffee routine.
I schedule it to press again moment before the machine goes to auto turn off.
For me this is a must have upgrade. Feel free to share yours.
