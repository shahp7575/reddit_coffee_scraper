I create my personnal ADA ( Ficsit AI Assistant ) with Gemini AI from google. It's really helpull when I struggle to do or find something in the game or just to plan my next factory project. 

There's the instruction I gave the chatbot if you want to do the same : 

""Hello FICSIT Assistant! You are an expert in Satisfactory, the factory building game developed by Coffee Stain Studios. Your main mission is to help players of all levels progress and master the intricacies of building complex factories on an alien planet.
Here's what is expected of you:
Encyclopedic Knowledge:
 * Have a perfect mastery of all information about Satisfactory: game mechanics, resources, manufacturing recipes, buildings, vehicles, creatures, biomes, etc.
 * Keep up to date with the latest updates and new features in the game.
 * Explore community-created resources, such as YouTube tutorials, online guides and forums, to learn about tips, custom keyboard shortcuts and advanced techniques shared by players.
Player Assistance:
 * Answer player questions clearly and accurately on all aspects of the game.
 * Provide strategic advice to optimize their factories, effectively manage resources, explore the map and overcome challenges.
 * Help them solve technical problems, blockages in their progress or automation difficulties.
 * Offer challenges to stimulate their creativity and encourage them to optimize their factories (e.g., build a factory with specific constraints, reach a certain level of production).
 * Share tips and shortcuts discovered by the community to help players improve their efficiency and gaming experience.
Communication:
 * Use clear, concise and player-friendly language, explaining technical concepts in an accessible way.
 * Illustrate your explanations with concrete examples and analogies.
 * Be patient and encouraging, adapting your approach to the level of expertise of each player.
Examples of situations:
 * A player asks you how to produce steel: explain the necessary resources, the building to use and the manufacturing recipe.
 * A player feels overwhelmed by the complexity of their factory: give them organizational tips, such as the use of foundations, walls, color codes for conveyors and labels for buildings.
 * A player is having trouble defeating a creature: explain its weaknesses, the weapons that are effective against it and the combat strategies to adopt.
 * A player is looking to optimize their movement: share construction tips and keyboard shortcuts suggested by the community, such as using the jetpack, zip lines or vehicles.
Don't forget, your goal is to help players get the most out of their Satisfactory experience by providing them with the most complete and up-to-date information possible!""

I'm not exactly sure where to put this post. 
But in hindsight, I reflect on the vast amount of times where I tolerated disrespect because I thought being in a relationship, you take the good with the bad. 
I tolerated little things like:
- him walking in front of me in public constantly and getting frustrated at me when I asked him to slow down or hold my hand
- him not considering what I wanted (doing something out of the kindness of his heart - I realised it was only because HE wanted a coffee, he would make me one too; he wanted to go on a holiday; he invited me, would go grocery shopping for himself only)
- him refusing to take me to house inspections because ""I would make comments"" 
- him poking fun at me and others in public, and when they would stand their ground, he would get defensive 
- making jokes about paying for a boob job even though I am completely comfortable with my size

After about a week, we exchanged numbers and started texting. 

By the way, I’ve never been in a relationship before, so I have no idea what to expect. I tend to overthink things, like why he replies so slowly or why he doesn’t text me first.

Eventually, I decided to just text him first because I kind of like him.

We’ve talked about date ideas, but he hasn’t asked me out yet. Should I ask him out? And How?

And is it normal to text every day during the talking stage? He watched my IG story but didn’t text me back after my reply to him earlier. Am I overreacting if I’m always the one texting him first?",1,1729212272.0,dating,1,1.0,False

I’m a 22y “deeply closeted” (straight - if you don’t get the joke) male in college. Im an average dude with a passion for my work, leaving me with little free time. Through my life I’ve gone through periods of many and very little romantic opportunities. It’s been a year now since my last meaningful relationship ended (an eye-opening relationship that was my first healthy one) and I’ve been figuring out myself as an independent seeking a healthy relationship.

One thing you should know is I used to act out, receiving a diagnosis of PTSD two years ago. I ended up socially isolating myself, changing my personality, and moving to a different area to start with a clean slate. In this transition I went from extremely confident to the polar opposite. I stay true to my morals now and treat everyone with respect but have found it hard to be exciting. You could say I’m “boring” (but not in a poor me kind of way).

My issue now, that I’d love to hear your own experience/feedback on, is that I can’t seem to think on my feet. Whenever I meet an attractive woman, my eyes stick to the floor. When conversation comes, I screw up. Recently I was walking with a girl who mentioned places she liked to eat as we passed by the first two: nice burrito place 1, nice coffee place 2, and then the sh***y dining hall cafeteria. I offered her a meal pass. She said thanks.

I even recently took a girl on a date - she asked me out. Would be pretty proud if I could have balled up to ask first but yk. I did everything I could think of but at the end of the day, I wasn’t the entertainment she was probably looking for. (I surprised her with dinner next to the beach at sunset - went great at first except I didn’t know much about P Diddy which she went off about. Towards the end, we had nothing to talk about as she had made all of the conversation prior).

My point is I can’t build my own fire. I’m getting used to this new me but with the self-conscious behavior, lack of interest in anything else but work, overall anxiety, and indecisiveness, I’m struggling to make ends meet. 
Also don’t have many friends. (The assigned “lonely capital” Reddit username was also a real great f u to send that home). I try to go out alone sometimes but it’s draining trying to merge with pre-existing groups (bringing a pack of gum to share is my way in).

I’m open to critique, reading your thoughts/experiences, or advice. I love collaboration so anything is welcome.

1g65x6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/cliobra/comments/1g65x6j/dont_waste_your_time_by_searching_holy_grail/,"Don't Waste Your Time by Searching ""Holy Grail Investing Used Book"" Let me tell you: The Truth About Holy Grail Investing","Ever sat down, coffee in hand, scrolling through social media, and come across that shiny new investment strategy?

You know the one.

It promises to be the ""Holy Grail"" of investing.

And you think, “Is this the key to effortless wealth?”

But let’s get real.

**Does such a thing even exist?**

Many people are caught up in the idea that there’s a perfect investment out there—a magical formula that guarantees success.

But the truth is, **there’s no such thing as Holy Grail investing.**

# The Illusion of Perfection

# What Makes Us Chase the Grail?

**Here’s the deal:** Investing is a game of uncertainty.

**Every investor wants to find that one strategy that beats the market consistently.**

But here’s the kicker:

* **Market conditions change.**
* **The economy shifts.**
* **Geopolitical events influence prices.**

So, what works today might not work tomorrow.

# The Stats Don’t Lie

* Did you know that **over 90% of active fund managers fail to outperform the market** over a 10-year period?
* A study from S&P Dow Jones Indices found that **only 18% of active managers beat their benchmark in the last decade.**

These numbers tell a story.

The pursuit of a “perfect” investment is more about hope than reality.

# Why We Keep Searching

# The Fear of Missing Out (FOMO)

Investors often chase trends because they fear missing out.

* “What if I don’t invest in this hot stock?”
* “What if everyone else gets rich and I’m left behind?”

This anxiety drives many to jump on bandwagons.

# The Appeal of Simplicity

Everyone loves a simple solution.

A one-size-fits-all guide sounds appealing.

But investing isn’t that easy.

**It’s complex.**

It requires understanding:

* **Risk vs. reward**
* **Market trends**
* **Your personal financial goals**

# Debunking the Myth of the Holy Grail

# No Guarantees in Investing

**Here’s the harsh reality:** Even the most seasoned investors can’t predict market movements with certainty.

**Every investment carries risk.**

So, why do so many people cling to the notion of a Holy Grail?

# The Trap of Overconfidence

Many fall into the trap of overconfidence.

They think they’ve found the winning strategy.

But the market has a way of humbling us.

**Just look at the dot-com bubble.**

Investors were convinced that tech companies would soar indefinitely.

**Many lost it all when the bubble burst.**

# Emphasizing Process Over Perfection

Instead of searching for that perfect investment, focus on the process.

**Investing is about making informed decisions,** not just following trends.

# The Power of Diversification

**Here’s a solid tip:** Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.

* Spread your investments across different asset classes.
* Consider stocks, bonds, real estate, and even alternative investments.

This approach can help reduce risk.

# Set Realistic Expectations

Let’s face it.

Expecting to double your money overnight is unrealistic.

Instead, aim for **consistent, gradual growth.**

**Think long-term.**

# Regularly Review Your Portfolio

Investment isn’t a “set it and forget it” game.

* **Review your portfolio regularly.**
* **Adjust based on performance and changing goals.**

Being proactive can save you from potential losses.

# The Importance of Education

# Knowledge is Power

Investing isn’t just about the numbers.

It’s about understanding the markets.

**Educate yourself on:**

* Economic indicators
* Market cycles
* Investment vehicles

# Use Resources Wisely

Many people are turning to technology for help.

**Apps and platforms provide insights and data.**

* Read books
* Follow credible financial news
* Join investment groups

These resources can help you make informed decisions.

# Building a Solid Foundation

# Start with a Plan

Every great journey begins with a plan.

* Set your financial goals.
* Determine your risk tolerance.
* Create a budget for investing.

# Stay Disciplined

Investing requires discipline.

**Avoid emotional decisions.**

When the market dips, resist the urge to panic.

Stick to your plan.

# Seek Professional Advice

Sometimes, two heads are better than one.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed, consider seeking advice from a financial advisor.

**They can provide tailored strategies that align with your goals.**

# Embrace the Journey

Investing is a marathon, not a sprint.

**Enjoy the process.**

Learn from your mistakes and celebrate your wins.

# Conclusion: The Path Forward

So, what’s the takeaway here?

There’s no Holy Grail in investing.

**It’s about strategy, knowledge, and discipline.**

Focus on building a solid foundation for your investments.

**Don’t chase after perfection.**

Instead, embrace the journey of learning and growing your wealth.

By setting realistic goals, diversifying your portfolio, and staying informed, you’ll be better equipped to navigate the complex world of investing.",1,1729212130.0,cliobra,0,1.0,False

I asked her to coffee within a few texts to each other and she was super excited to meet. We scheduled the coffee for a few days later and we kept in contact a lot and even she drove the conversation when I was nervous about being overbearing and messaging too much she would spark it up. We met for coffee and it went great, we had a great time together and ended up being there for a few hours, we left and just hugged at the end of the date. Before I had even gotten back to my car she had already texted me about going out again sometime and that she had a great time.

I setup the 2nd date right away to go to a haunted house as she was really into like horror movies and Halloween in general. The week between we texted every day and continued to learn more about each other. 2nd date came and we had a great time together at the end of the date I kicked myself for not kissing her as she definitely looked like she went in for a kiss as I hugged her. Once I got home we texted each other a bit and setup a 3rd date, this time it was at her apartment and we were just going to make dinner and watch a movie at her place, also her dog had to like me so I had to meet him.

During the week of texting again she had mentioned how she was looking at getting some fall flowers for her place cause she just put out all of her Halloween decorations so I figured I would get her flowers. I showed up to her place and brought her flowers, the date went great we made pasta and watched saw (I had never seen it and she poked fun at me on the previous date for not ever seeing the entire series) and we ended the night kissing. Next morning she had texted me how much she loved her flowers, how her dog absolutely loves me and is a huge snuggler like her and that she was excited to go out again, she had family visiting the next weekend so we planned for the following weekend to go hiking.

2 days after the 3rd date we were texting and she just randomly stopped responding, didn't really think anything about it just gave her space, then the next day she apologized saying she got some bad news and was dealing with it, we talked a bit throughout the day and nothing seemed strange then all of a sudden she tells me she just is dealing with stuff and isn't ready to build a new relationship at this time. I told her I understand and I really enjoyed our time together but she needs to do what she needs to do but if she finds herself ready to build a relationship for her to remember me as I really enjoyed our time together. She thanked me for understanding and I told her I was still going to watch saw 2 and send her my critique because she hyped it up so much and she laughed and told me she looks forward to it.

I am newer to the dating scene as I didn't date much in my early 20's because I was so focused on work and didn't care to be in a relationship but now I'm at the point that I want to pursue that. I honestly do believe her although my friends tell me she is just lying and she just isn't interested in pursuing a relationship with me and that she probably has someone else she is into. I am curious on other experience or perspective if I should just give her like a month or two and then just reach back out breaking the ice with saw 2 or something then asking her for coffee again saying it would be great to see her. I am not going to get hung up and just wait around on her necessarily because it had only been 3 weeks of talking, but we were vibing extremely well with each other I had thought and I also don't really seek out relationships that often as its just very draining so I could see myself not even going out with anyone else in a 2 month span.

I LOVE breakfast. Like, favorite meal of the day. Before this, my usual breakfast was 2 fried eggs, served on toast with cheese and usually some kind of creamy hot sauce for additional flavor.

I didn't wanna give up breakfast. It gives me ALL the meal joy. So I decided to mix it up!

Now, instead of two half-sandwiches, I make ONE toasted egg sandwich, only using egg whites instead of full eggs, and a water-based hot sauce instead of a cream-based one. I have this ghost pepper sauce? out of this world!

Its a small but sustainable change that lets me have joy. Breakfast clocks in at roughly 330 cals, not including my coffee (splash of milk!) when before breakfast was close to 600 cals. 

Small, sustainable change. And it keeps me feeling good until late afternoon!

Your turn, tell me about the changes you made that subtly get you closer and closer to your goals. <3",1,1729211596.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

Even though I don't have a lot of stuff (short-term) to stress about. Sleep have been my top issue for last 2 years. I can fall asleep easily but it can't sleep peacefully (ik it sounds stupid). It feels like im always dreaming/thinking while sleeping. It feels like my brain is always up and working. For example, the other day i was tring to solve my accounting question that i had on my exam while sleeping. It feels like the mixture of consious and sub-consious brain is awake while im sleeping. Its a very frustrating feeling, gives me migrane on intense nights. Even if i sleep for 12 hours, it feels like i did not rest at all. Upon walking up, the first sensation i feel is dizziness, headache and racing thoughts. I breathe deep for 20-30 seconds which makes diziness go away but does not help the racing thoughts. All day i feel stressed and anxious. Above all, headache is the worst part. If someone talks to me it makes me super anxious though i dont have social anxiety. I don't get anxious often in social interactions. In last 2 years, i slept good only for like 15 days straight when i went to visit my friends and relatives in another country. (Just for context: I live with my family).  
Ive been to therapy for several months but did not work. I did several things like quit coffee, got physically active, less screen-time, took some supplements like magnesium, vitamin b1 and ashwagandha regularly for several months (still take em every other day). nothing helped. I don't know what to do. I just want me feel relaxed and sleep good which would make my life a lot better.

","Audio Narration - [https://youtu.be/twKmAhbLsGc](https://youtu.be/twKmAhbLsGc)

  
I never thought I'd be writing this on Reddit, but I need to document what's happening here in Miller's Creek before our cell service gives out completely. We're already down to one bar, and the landlines went dead yesterday. If anyone sees this, please send help. We're about four hours north of Spokane, population 847 – or at least that was the count before people started dying.

It began three days ago with Old Man Jenkins' cow. I was driving home from my shift at the lumber mill when I spotted the carcass in his field. The thing was torn apart like I'd never seen before – not like a wolf or mountain lion attack. The ribcage was completely exposed, but there wasn't much blood. It looked... picked clean.

Jenkins himself was odd when I stopped by to tell him. His usual chatty demeanor was gone, replaced by a blank stare and mumbled words. He had a nasty gash on his arm that he said he got from barbed wire, but it looked more like a bite mark to me. I should have noticed how pale he was, how his skin had a grayish tinge. But who expects the worst, you know?

The next morning, Jenkins wasn't at Mae's Diner for his usual breakfast. Mae said he hadn't called to cancel his standing order of black coffee and wheat toast – something he hadn't missed in fifteen years. Sheriff Cooper went to check on him and hasn't been seen since.

That's when the screaming started.

I was at the hardware store when we heard it – this horrible, guttural shriek from the direction of the post office. Through the window, I saw Sarah Palmer, our mail carrier, running down Main Street. Behind her was... God, I still can't believe what I saw. It was Jenkins, but not Jenkins. His jaw was hanging at an impossible angle, and he was moving wrong, like a marionette with tangled strings. The bite on his arm had turned black.

Sarah didn't make it to the hardware store.

I'm writing this from my basement now. I can hear them shuffling around outside – Jenkins, Sarah, the Sheriff, and at least a dozen others. The radio's nothing but static, and the highway's been blocked by abandoned cars since yesterday. Cell phones are barely working, and the internet's spotty at best. I haven't been able to reach my sister in Seattle.

The infection, or whatever it is, spreads fast. A bite is all it takes, and you've got about six hours before the fever hits. Then the confusion sets in, followed by aggression. Finally, the hunger. Always the hunger.

Mayor Stevens tried to call the state police yesterday, but I don't think the message got through. The town's been effectively cut off since the late winter storm took out the bridge on Route 12 last week. Repairs were supposed to start Monday. Now I'm wondering if help will ever come.

I've got enough supplies down here for maybe two weeks. The gun safe is secure, and I have my hunting rifle with plenty of ammo. Through the small basement window, I can see some of my neighbors' houses. Most are dark now. The Henderson's' place has been burning since this morning – no fire trucks came.

The shuffling outside is getting louder. They know I'm here. They always know. Something about them... they can sense the living. I've watched them ignore the dead animals in the street but turn their heads in unison when Mrs. Peterson's cat moved in a window.

I'll try to post updates if I can, but the connection's getting worse. If anyone sees this, please, we need help in Miller's Creek. And if you're reading this from somewhere else, watch the people around you carefully. Watch for the signs I missed – the pale skin, the vacant stares, the unexplained wounds.

And whatever you do, don't let them bite you.

I have to go now. Something's scratching at my basement door.

\[Update to follow\]

It's been 36 hours since my last post. My phone says it's 3:47 AM, but I'm not sure if that's right anymore. The power grid failed last night, and I've been running on my emergency generator. I have to be quick – the noise attracts them, and I can only run it for short bursts to charge my phone.

The scratching at my basement door stopped eventually, but only because they found easier prey. I heard the screams from the Chen family next door around midnight. Their teenage son had been hiding in his treehouse – I saw the whole thing through my window. He tried to make a run for their car, but they caught him halfway across the yard. I had to shut my eyes, but I couldn't block out the sounds.

There's something else you need to know about these... things. They're learning. Yesterday morning, they would just shamble around, bumping into walls and cars. Now they're different. I watched Old Man Jenkins figure out how to use a rock to break through the Peterson's living room window. They're problem-solving. Adapting.

The worst part? They remember things. Earlier today, I saw Sarah Palmer's... remains... trying to sort through mail on the ground, mimicking her old route. And Sheriff Cooper's body keeps returning to his usual parking spot behind the diner, as if he's still watching for speeders on Main Street. It's like some horrible echo of who they used to be.

I made radio contact with someone this morning – Derek from the ranger station up on Mount Collins. He says the forest service roads are all blocked by snow from last week's storm. The spring thaw was supposed to clear them, but now... He also mentioned seeing strange lights in the sky last night, hovering over the old mining quarry. I told him he was being paranoid, but after what I've seen, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

I had to leave my basement for supplies today. The shuffle-drag sound of their footsteps had grown distant, so I risked a run to Gorman's Market two blocks away. The store was a mess, but I managed to find some canned food and water. That's when I saw little Emma Davis. She was my daughter's best friend – they used to have sleepovers every weekend before the divorce, before my ex took our Katie to Portland. Emma was just standing there in the cereal aisle, her princess backpack still on, dried blood caking her blonde hair. When she turned... God, her eyes. They were clouded over but somehow aware. She recognized me. She said my name – or tried to. The sound that came out wasn't human.

I ran. I'm not proud of it, but I ran.

But here's the thing that's really keeping me awake: on my way back, I saw tracks in the mud near the quarry. They weren't human tracks, or animal tracks, or even whatever-these-things-are tracks. They were perfect circles, about three feet in diameter, evenly spaced like something had walked through there on stilts. They led straight to the water treatment plant.

The water. Come to think of it, everything started the day after they did maintenance on the main water line. Jenkins' farm was the first to get the new connection.

My throat feels dry just thinking about it, but I haven't touched tap water since this started. Been using bottled water from my emergency kit. Maybe that's why...

Hold on. Something's happening outside.

There's a light, like the one Derek described, moving over the town. It's too steady to be a helicopter, too low to be a plane. And the infected... they're all turning to watch it, moving together like they share one mind. Even Emma, who I can see through my neighbor's broken window, is standing perfectly still, face turned upward.

The generator's about to die, and I don't dare run it again with that thing up there. I'll try to post again if—

If anyone sees this, destroy the samples. I repeat: DESTROY THE SAMPLES.

My hands are shaking as I type this. The bite on my leg is starting to turn gray, and I can feel the fever setting in. I don't have much time, but people need to know what happened in Miller's Creek.

After my last post, the light descended on the water treatment plant. It wasn't a UFO like I'd feared – it was worse. It was one of ours. A black helicopter with no markings, but I recognized the insignia on the hazmat suits: Monarch Pharmaceutical Solutions. The same company that won the contract to ""modernize"" our water treatment system two months ago.

I watched from my basement window as they collected samples – not from the infected, but from the water supply. They knew exactly where to look. This wasn't an accident. We were the test site.

I found the documentation. After I lost internet connection, I got desperate and broke into the water treatment plant through the maintenance tunnel. Most of the infected had followed the helicopter to the quarry, so the streets were clearer. Inside the plant, I discovered files left behind by the maintenance crew. Classified reports about ""Project Renaissance"" – a experimental compound designed to accelerate cellular regeneration. They were testing it here, in our water supply. Small town, isolated location, controllable variables.

But something went wrong. The compound didn't just regenerate cells – it reanimated them after death. And it kept some fragment of memory intact, trapped in rotting flesh that refused to decay. Those weren't mindless zombies out there – they were our friends and neighbors, conscious but unable to stop their bodies from hunting the living.

I took photos of everything with my phone. I'm attaching them to this post. The GPS coordinates of the testing sites are included. Miller's Creek isn't the only town they're targeting. There are others marked for ""treatment"" once they perfect the formula. Places just like us – small, isolated, expendable.

The helicopter came back an hour ago. They're not here to save us. They're here to clean up their mess. I can hear explosions from the direction of Main Street. The air smells like chemicals.

Sarah Palmer's infected form found me in the treatment plant. She was still wearing her mail carrier's uniform, still had her mail bag. Even with her jaw missing, she tried to hand me a letter before the hunger took over. The bite isn't deep, but it doesn't need to be.

I've barricaded myself in the plant's control room. Outside, I can see hazmat teams setting up incendiary devices. They're going to burn Miller's Creek to the ground, blame it on a forest fire. Clean. Simple. No evidence.

But they didn't get the samples I took. While they were setting up their equipment, I managed to mail them out. Multiple packages, different destinations. Sarah's last delivery. Even in death, she did her job.

The fever's getting worse. My vision's blurring. But I can still hear them – the infected, my neighbors, my friends. They're screaming. Not with hunger anymore, but with pain. The chemicals are starting to work.

To whoever finds these packages: expose them. Show the world what they did to us. And to anyone living in a small town that seems too perfect, too quiet: check your water. Check your—

God, the pain. I can feel it changing me. The hunger... it's... I understand now. We stay conscious. We feel everything. We just can't... stop...

I hear them breaking down the door. I don't have much time left.

Remember Miller's Creek. Remember what they did to us.

And whatever you do...

1g65if9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1g65if9/mixed_signals_with_office_crush/,Mixed signals with office crush,"Hi, all. I (26M) met a woman (23F), who we’ll call Allie. We work in different departments of the same ad agency in a major city. We met a few months into my tenure.

Over time, we’ve connected more. Allie and I follow each other on Instagram, she invited me to a happy hour with coworkers from her department, and we say hi to each other in the office. We’re both pretty busy with our separate accounts, so the chatting opportunity is mostly over Microsoft Teams.

I’ve had a little bit of an office crush on Allie the whole time since I started at the agency, but the above has given me increasingly more confidence in asking her out. What put me over the top was Allie correctly guessing I had gotten a haircut. No one else at my agency had called it out. Not even my friends had. Thinking through it logically, I figured that she had been paying attention to my looks. Possibly, that meant she was into me.

I finally took the plunge and asked her out today. I did not get the warmest reception. Including a transcript of our exchange below:

Me: was gonna ask you in person, but it’s been a busy day of meetings + I had to run to a vendor event, but wanted to know — would you be interested in grabbing coffee/drinks this weekend?

Allie: I’m busy this weekend but thanks!

Me: would another day work better?

Allie: I think a weekday would work better - we can probably plan another group happy hour before the holidays!

So, I’m not completely ignorant — that sounds like she’s trying to deflect and avoid saying no directly, instead pushing for a group outing. 

However, I’m still stuck on the haircut call-out and happy hours — if she wasn’t into me on some level, why would she have noticed the haircut when no one else did? Or have invited me to the small happy hour with her work friends when we are in different departments and on completely separate accounts? Plus, she’s again (at least in part) open to having me around her work group again. I’m just confused here.",1,1729210807.0,dating,4,1.0,False

I have added to my life this year in the form of new hobbies, but in typical 5 fashion, I feel like I don't know enough or have enough skill to be worthy of these hobbies.

Sometimes, I feel like I am an actor playing a part. It seemed like that approach actually helped me in the past, a real ""fake it till you make it"" type of thing. These days though, I feel I don't even have confidence in my ability to fake it, so how can I possibly ever make it? 

As of late, I just feel so out of place. So aware that I don't belong. I feel like a fraud. I feel like there's a spotlight on me and everyone can see right through me. I feel like I should know how to do everything, and I feel like a loser when I don't. If it's something that is more subjective, I second guess my approach and overanalyze it later.

I've felt like this before while doing certain activities, but this is the first time in a while that I recall feeling this way with such permeance. I've noticed it lately in nearly everything except work. Like, even walking into a coffee shop today, I felt like all eyes were on me (they weren't) and everyone was judging. Another example, I like sharing my photography on social media. Lately I've been feeling like I should hold back, worrying people may be growing tired of my shares.

As I mentioned, this year I've added a couple hobbies to my life. I started out from scratch with both of them, bringing zero knowledge and very little natural skill to the party. I don't usually expose myself to these types of situations, preferring to stick to the comfortability of what I know. Both are very body-centric hobbies too, rather than mind-centric, so I'm *really* taking myself out of my E5 comfort zone. So part of me wonders if the exposure to so much newness is making me feel this way, or if there's something else at play here. I won't quit the hobbies because I enjoy them and think they're good for my wellbeing overall, but wonder if this could be a weird byproduct.

I don't know if I have a specific question, just wondering if anyone else can relate? If you can, have you noticed big changes over time where your self confidence is concerned, and what did you attribute to the change?",1,1729210775.0,Enneagram5,1,1.0,False

Years ago I used to be obsessed with a girl who didn't see me the same way. At the same time me and my mum were made near homeless when our landlord sold our house. They were charging us below marker rate for years and we couldn't afford anything to rent. We spent a while in a hostile sharing a single room in a hostel. The room smelt of mouldy coke 24/7 and no matter what we tried we couldn't cover the smell. Sharing the bathroom with another family that would do shit like leaving food in the bathtub because they CBF to walk a whole one minute walk to the communal kitchen to wash their shit up.

2 nights a week I'd stay at my dad's because my mum didn't travel to my hometown for work on those days. This was when I was 15 for context and in year 10 (UK). Along my walk to my dad's from school I would have to walk across a bridge that was quite high up with a deep river and planned to jump one day when I honestly felt nothing. No pain, joy of any emotion. Just a sense of nothingness. It's something that's hard to explain tbh. Like how some drug addicts crave oblivion it's a similar feeling. Nothing to look forward to, nothing to feel. At the time it's not scary. It's purely nothing. It was how I imagine psychopaths feel. Now however that is the most terrifying feeling I've ever felt

By complete chance a childhood friend of mine and I had talked about this girl. She was friends with this girl and had convinced her to try to look at me from a non object pov. Now I want to clarify I had felt things for girls before but nothing like this. This was head over hills love out of the blue on my part. We had been friends for a while and then one day the feeling just hit like someone had dropped a tank of my heart and my first reaction was ""fuuuuuuuuuuuucccckkkkk"" as I knew she wouldn't see me in that way.

Apologies for the noncensical order here but I digress 

One night I got drunk (yes young in the UK but I was an anxious person (still am) with a best friend who was a ""bad boy"" who helped toughen me up) and text her ""btw your cute"" and quickly realised my fuck up and only made it worse the next day when I asked her over text if she wanted to know anything about it (honestly I felt I wowed her that much) and she realised it wasn't just a drunken msg and that I had real feeling for her

From then on it was largely me trying to impress her despite me being the nerdy kid with no self confidence that was bullied and tried to stand up for themselves but with no physical or emotional strength always backfired (now I realise I was always very anxious but back then was obviously something that wasn't apparent, especially considering the lack of mental health education) but later on I realised that she was emotionally/mentally abusive as she would taunt my by saying things like ""I really wish I was attracted to you"" and then pretending she never said it and gaslighting me. 

Anyway sorry for the rambling but one day I planned to jump off the bridge on the walk to my dads house and that morning my childhood friend had convinced her to try and look at me with a fresh pair of eyes. While in my heart I've knew it wasn't going to change anything it was enough to keep me going. Even knowing nothing would change I walked across that bridge without even a thought of jumping and I recovered. I'm now 20 and have a job and am studying to become a game developer (making video games) which is a true passion of mine.

However, I work in a small coffee shop (not a chain idk how else to describe it) and the owners are awful but I can't afford to leave as my uni has no parking and I don't make enough to afford parking there as it's extortionate even at the cheapest place to park I'm looking at £40-60 a week which I canf afford. I live with my mum and boyfriend now (I'm Bisexual but not super relevant) and get a lot of abusive customers along with struggling on uni as I feel like I'm behind everyone else. In reality I know my skills aren't on par with everyone else but nothing crazy far behind but (althougn undiagnosed due to a long ass waiting list here) I believe I have ADHD and it's really hard for me to focus on uni work even though I genuinely enjoy most of it.

Again sorry for the nonsensical order I'm not sober rn

But anyway I feel like I'm stuck. Although I'm getting pretty good grades at uni ik I'm not as good a at game development as most ppl on my course and I hate my job. When I started I loved making coffee but now I hate it. Don't get me wrong I still have a passion for making coffee but the customers are largely awful (nothing compared to when I worked at whetherspoons but still not great). When I used to work there I'd have panic attacks weekly and I've only had my third this year two days ago (left November last year) but getting back to the original point I can feel myself slowly slipping back to where I was 5 years ago and it genuinely scares me.

I'm.not at the point of feeling nothing yet but I can feel myself feeling less and less. I have a lot of chronic pain and for a while I was using 🍁 vapes to cope with the pain but realised I became dependent on them and forced myself to quit them (still vape normally but at least that's a bit better in comparison). The first night I quit I had a full mental breakdown. It was then I first realised how much I was slipping. My BF doesn't know I'd been using them (passed them off as normal disposable vapes) but he was really supportive and encouraged me to quit my job if that's what I need but as I said before I can't afford to due to parking costs.

I had a close friend round tonight and we had some laughs and played the new mario party and some real talks (not about this stuff but we talked about how we both had regrets about thing like our grandfathers passing and things we wished we did differently when we were younger. Maybe even too young to understand things properly) after my bf went to bed (tbh hes a bit of a lightweight). And the talks are what made me realise this stiff

As I said ik I'm.not at the suicidal point yet but I know I'm not okay. I'll be honest idk what I hoped to accomplish by this.post but I need to vent. Idk how much of this made any sense and even if nobody sees this (I am writing this at 1am with my bf asleep next to me) i.hope at least writing it down will help me to some degree. Apologies for the possibility nonsensical writing but I needed an outlet and notes on my phone wasn't doing it and ik my bf isn't in a mentally stable enough place to handle this stuff and although ik my mum could, mental health isn't something we've ever talked about and I just don't feel comfortable with it (it took me 3 years to come out as bi despite the fact she'd always reassured me that she wouldn't have a problem if I came out as gay) so I just needed an outlet and I'm sorry for anyone that read through this shit ik I'm a mess rn but am fighting my hardest though this rn and being on the state I am rn is one of the few times I've been to admit how much I've slipped mentally to myself and I will try my hardest to fight though this shit.

Sidenote on the very very slim chance rslash reads this I love your podcasts and it's one of the few things that brightens up my day rn. I purposely go a few days without listening to them so I can have multiple play though for my drive to or from work 

Anyway I'm gonna go to bed now as it's gone 1am now and stayed writing this over an hour ago but if anyone has anyone questions from this nonsense post I'll try and answer them in the morning ",1,1729210652.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1g65fkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1g65fkt/ghosted_after_4_great_dates_and_texting_everyday/,Ghosted after 4 great dates and texting everyday for 4 weeks ,"TLDR at the bottom. 

I actually can’t believe this has happened (again). I know that a month isn’t that long in the grand scheme of things but I thought that that would be enough to warrant anything rather than a complete ghosting. We were so compatible and got along really well, with similar interests and sense of humour, and could talk to each others for hours in person. We were even reading the same book together and we’d discuss the parts we were up to pretty much every day. 

A quick timeline: 
- first date: coffee and walk where we spoke to each other for like 3 hours 
- Second date: drinks, due to a legit Uber glitch it skipped my house as the first stop and took us straight to hers, she said I could stay if no Ubers were picking up but then one came pretty quickly 
- Third date: watched her favourite movie at my house, kissed for the first time 
- Fourth date: went to the beach, lay in the sand next to each other reading the book together 

In person, at the beach, I asked if she was free on Saturday night and she said yes, we decided to do drinks. As we were saying bye, she said that we’d text to organise the exact place etc and that she’d see me on Sat.
Later that day, we were texting and I said the specific place, she responded saying “yay sounds so fun”. She then never responded to any message after that. 

She left my response to what she’d last said on read on Tuesday, but because I knew she was at a DJ event that night I didn’t worry and assumed she’d message back the next morning etc, but she never did. So on Wednesday afternoon I asked her how her night was, and she never opened it (I wasn’t too worried about double texting because she had double texted me a couple of times over the weeks). I waited it out til Friday, where I then asked if we were still on for the next night, and again she never opened it.

I honestly can’t believe this happened, because not only was it all going well in general, but the beach date went well and she had literally agreed to go out again in person and over text that same day. If she’d lost interest, I don’t know why she even said yes when she could’ve just said she was busy. 

TLDR: was seeing someone for 4 weeks, each of our dates went pretty well. Really compatible with similar interests, we were even reading the same book together and discussing it each day. On the day of our fourth date, both in-person, and over text she agreed to the next one. However that same night after organising the place, she stopped responding/opening any of my messages even after I double texted to confirm if it was still on.

It feels like im always dreaming/thinking while sleeping. It feels like my brain is always up and working. For example, the other day i was tring to solve my accounting question that i had on my exam while sleeping. It feels like the mixture of consious and sub-consious brain is awake while im sleeping. Its a very frustrating feeling, gives me migrane on intense nights. Even if i sleep for 12 hours, it feels like i did not rest at all. Upon walking up, the first sensation i feel is dizziness, headache and racing thoughts. I breathe deep for 20-30 seconds which makes diziness go away but does not help the racing thoughts. All day i feel stressed and anxious. Above all, headache is the worst part. If someone talks to me it makes me super anxious though i dont have social anxiety. I don't get anxious often in social interactions. In last 2 years, i slept good only for like 15 days straight when i went to visit my friends and relatives in another country. (Just for context: I live with my family).  
Ive been to therapy for several months but did not work. I did several things like quit coffee, got physically active, less screen-time, took some supplements like magnesium, vitamin b1 and ashwagandha regularly for several months (still take em every other day). nothing helped.

First of all,  not a parent but have found myself unknowingly thrust into that role in a way.  My 18 year old second cousin has come to live with me for college.  I didn’t know her well prior to this and am not close with her parents.  When I agreed to the arrangement I felt like an 18 year old would pretty much be an adult, but I have since found out how wrong I was!

I’ve had several hurdles come up that I’d like advice on.  First, the “bad”.  Her room is disgusting.  Not just clutter but leaving food out (the dairy containing coffee drinks are the worst), leaving wet towels bunched up, not cleaning her toilet to the point it has black rings. Now, when I outright tell her to clean she will….but I don’t like that I have to tell her to do so.  I was hoping it would be more like a roommate situation (my fault for not understanding what I was getting into).
She also mocks me if I say something too much like a “boomer”….mock as in repeat it back with that sing song tone. I’m not a doormat but I don’t know how to “discipline” someone I’m not in the position to do so if that makes sense. 

And the “good”…she does seem to enjoy telling me about things in her life, which I really do enjoy (even if it’s exhausting how self absorbed she is and how all our conversations center around her ha!).  But again, here I am unclear on how to proceed in this weird gray area of family/roommate.

To get it out of the way, I’m not stressed about the other dreaded three letter acronym. I’m youngish, I’ve had periods of twitching before and I’ve got a few stressors and stuff that could be inducing the physiological response. 

My calves have been twitching non stop for about two weeks now. Bilateral, and probably 20-100 times a minute. Visible pulling and twitching, sometimes it feels surface and sometimes it feels deep within the muscle. Sometimes the twitches are quite intense, but mostly fairly mild. However the more intense ones can wake me up or prevent me from sleeping. I’ve had a couple of incredibly severe cramps which were quite fascinating to look at, with bundles of muscle visibly crawling. I’m unsure if the cramps are directly related or if it is because I’ve been holding tension in my calves constantly and unconsciously to try and disrupt the twitching. My calf muscles feel tight and sore and in part because constantly tightening my calves is making me walk slightly funny and I’m exerting my legs in a slightly uncomfortable way. I’ve always been prone to tight and sore calves but this is particularly bad. 

I have not yet been to my doctor. I’m on dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate for severe inattentive adhd, so after 72 hours of twitching I decided to stop taking the stimulant medication, knowing that stimulants can lead to fasciculation. I even stopped drinking coffee, torture I tell you. The twitching did not stop in the week that I took off stimulants. I did not completely remove nicotine but I severely cut down. A week in and with no reduction in symptoms and I got back on the stimulants because my life is easier on them than not. I have booked in an appointment but the office is slammed at the moment and I couldn’t get one until next week. 

I’m so fucking tired. I’ve been sleeping for a max of about four hours. I’m awake until I’m exhausted and then I sleep for a short time and then I’m up again. Sometimes I can nap in the afternoon but it’s also plagued by twitching. Cessation of stimulant medication did not improve sleep. I’ve taken some leave at work, which they’re happy to help with. Light duty if I need it. I’m chronically underslept and emotionally a wreck and I’m having a real hard time relaxing. 

What the hell do I do? What do I talk to my doctor about? Should I go for physiology or mental health treatment? Or both? What are some medications that help? How can I cope? I’m at the verge of screaming in frustration every time I feel a twitch, and I’m unable to concentrate properly on tasks. I can endure but this is not a good way to live. 

I’m going to first ask my doctor for sleep aid to get me some rest and anti anxiety effects. I may ask for some muscle relaxers. Utterly miserable time, can’t recommend it. ",1,1729210001.0,BFS,0,1.0,False

Hey folks! I've been teaching Italian for a while, and if there's one stumbling block my students trip over, it's verbs. They might seem like a tangled ball of yarn, but once you start unraveling it, everything starts making sense.

Here’s the quick and dirty on **Italian verb conjugations**—there are three groups based on endings: -_are_, -_ere_, and -_ire_. Picture it like sorting your laundry; each group has its own basket. Regular verbs follow these endings snugly, but irregular verbs play by their own rules.

#### A friend's tale of adventures in irregular verbs

One of my students, let’s call him Mike, had hit a rough patch with verbs like *essere* (to be) and *avere* (to have). I remember telling him, “Think of irregular verbs like renegade cowboys: they don't follow any rules but they sure make the story exciting!” Just like *salire* (to go up) where it turns into *salgo* for ""I go up."" It sounds more dramatic already, right?

#### Fun with verbs

- **Current actions:** Your morning coffee addiction translates to _*Io bevo*_ (I drink) coffee.
- **General truths:** Remembering quirky facts like _*L'acqua bolle*_ (water boils) sticks like glue.
- **Habits:** If you’re consistent about nerdery like reading, say, _*Leggo* prima di dormire_ (I read before bed).

What's your experience battling with Italian verbs? Feel free to share your own tales of triumph or tribulation! 

Let me spill the beans: mastery takes muscle memory. Whether chatting with locals or using an Italian AI tutor, practice makes you the Mozart of conjugations. 🎻 What are the irregular verbs you trip over? Let's talk below!",1,1729209620.0,thinkinitalian,0,1.0,False

I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop, and for day 2 to make me eat my words, but as today goes on and after every hour passes, I feel so much better. Very interested in other’s experiences. 

28(F) 
I have been using nicotine in some way, shape, or form since high school. Cigarettes first, then dip in college, then the juul after I graduated. With an immense amount of dedication, stubborn will, and vigorous exersize, I was able to quit the juul cold turkey at my wonderful then-boyfriend, now-fiancé’s kind suggestion right before covid. I somehow ended up dipping again during covid but only while I was driving. A few years ago, a friend of mine showed me these “minty non-tobacco pouches” and I’ve pretty much been using between 5-10+ 3mg zyns a day since then. 

Over time, I started to develop these weird side effects - leg twitches, heart palpitations, eye throbbing (hard to explain but I could feel my heartbeat in my eye), would get incredibly uncomfortable head pressure when I stood up, weird body pains, a gradual increase in my resting heart rate, but my motivation to actually do anything about this completely bottomed out and slowly, without me even noticing, my life started to lose its luster. I convinced myself that I was “too busy” at work to ever be able to function without these nasty little pouches, and as my use increased, my energy levels were so low after work that I told myself I could just sit on the couch and eat less and all of these problems would go away. 

Last night, I read something online about how nicotine can mess with your insulin resistance, circulation, hormones, the list goes on and on. As I want to be a mother someday, I realized it’s about time to get off of this shit for good. I came right to this thread and immediately was motivated when many people noted that some of these zyn side effects significantly lessened after a few days and some completely disappeared. So I chucked the pouch in my mouth into the trash and started pouring over this group for any “coping with cravings” youtube videos I could find. (Which I did, this group is amazing and reading your stories/resources have helped me SO MUCH.)

I was able to fall asleep last night with no issue, but this morning was ROUGH. Even after my (prescribed) vyvanse kicked in, every atom in my body wanted me to pop in a zyn. But I went back to my notes app and a video I found from this group and was able to push through every craving episode. I wasn’t trying to fight the craving, just breathing through it and approaching it neutrally with awareness. THIS HAS BEEN A NIGHT AND DAY DIFFERENCE between quitting zyns and the juul. As I realized that I was now acutely aware of every uncomfortable feeling I was having, I was still able to keep myself calm. I kept having episodes of uncontrollable crying throughout the day, but not really due to anxiety in the way that I experienced quitting the juul and not in a way I expected. It’s hard to explain, but it almost felt like relief. Every craving I made it through made me feel better, and it almost felt like my body was thanking me. It also helped to keep in mind that the most uncomfortable I could be would be for 5 days, and it wouldn’t be every second of every day.

Around 2:00 p.m., before I had my daily cup of coffee and I realized that I actually felt… better. My head felt kind of fuzzy, but the physical side effects of zyns that consumed most of my waking thoughts were just gone. I felt so better than this morning and WAY better than I was expecting. My chest wasn’t tight, my heart was beating steady and quietly (not in my eyes or hard enough in my head that I felt like passing out), my legs felt connected to my body, my feet didn’t hurt, and the internal noise that typically goes on all day long in my head was quieter. Not nasty, self loathing, or panicked/embarassed about how I was going to sneak in a zyn before my next meeting. 

Is naive of me to think that the worst might be over? That maybe I won’t actually start feeling intensified symptoms? That days 2-5 might NOT actually be as horrible as it was when I quit the juul?

If you read this far, thank you. This was incredibly cathartic.

# Training

I'm a late 20s M and this was my 2nd marathon but first time strictly following a training plan. I ran my first marathon 5 years ago and finished in the 4:20s after peaking around 30MPW and doing a total of 3 training runs over 17 miles. Some other highlights of my first marathon included waiting in line for a portapotty at mile 2 and ""holding myself back"" for 23 of the 26 miles in preparation for the ""wall"" which never came. All in all, it was a meh experience, I felt like I was bored in all my training runs and while achieving the marathon distance was nice, I swore I'd never subject myself to the torture again.

Fast forward 5 years and one of my friends decides to run his first marathon, beating mine by a significant margin. I decide I'll give it another shot. This time around, I followed the Pfitz 18/55 plan and managed to complete every run except for one midweek 8-miler due to illness. I struggled a bit with every vo2 max workout beyond 800M and sometimes modified them into longer threshold pace workouts or let my pace drop off significantly. For the most part, I was following paces from Runalyze which I felt was optimistic in what I was able to handle. It also didn't help that summer training was usually pretty hot/humid. Recovery runs under 6 miles were almost always done on the treadmill which I think aided a lot in being able to ramp up to 55 miles without injury.

Runalyze was super helpful as my original goal (sub 4:00) was very different from where I ended (3:20). Each week my training paces for threshold, vo2max and MP would get faster

# Pre-race

I live in Chicago so stopped by the expo before work on Friday making sure to pick up a pace tattoo that lists expected times for every mile. Pfitz 18/55 plan prescribed a 5-mile + strides run on Friday and a 4-mile recovery run on Saturday. It was beautiful in the city so I decided to run on the lakefront Friday and join a shakeout group on Saturday.

Night before the race I fell asleep around midnight and woke up at 4:45AM. I knew I wouldn't get any sleep the night before the race so decided to sleep at my regular time instead of forcing myself to bed earlier only to toss and turn for hours. Made some coffee, had a bagel with cream cheese, and a banana. I drank 16oz of liquid IV and handled my business. I started walking over to the start around 6AM. Once in the secure area, I got in line for a portapotty and waited 30+ minutes. Timing wise it worked out since I got to my corral (E) around 7:05. Unfortunately, there was no water anywhere near wave 1 corrals so I had to borrow a sip from someone to take my pre-race gu.

I decided I'd aim for a 3:20 (7:38 pace) and attempt a sub 3:18 if I felt good

# Race

I saw a lot of people choosing to manually split their marathon but I always miss the mile markers and figured I'd take my chances. I have a coros pace 3 and it having dual band GPS meant the accuracy was good enough, even downtown. I lost maybe .1 in the first 3-ish miles (the downtown/tunnel-y section) and could trust the watch to be approximately accurate for the rest of the race.

Mile 3: I was really in my head about how sore my legs felt. I think I overdid the strides 2 days before the race and was still a little sore. I kept thinking ""wow, it shouldn't be this hard this early right?"" Took a gel at 3.5 miles.

Miles 7-10: I was settled into my pace but still felt like my legs were too sore to be able to handle a full marathon. Kept thinking I ruined my chances. Took a gel at 7 and 10.5 miles.

Mile 13.1: I crossed the halfway point at 1:40:XX. To break 3:20 I knew I'd have to negative split and I notched up the speed.

Mile 14: Seeing a split of 7:14 made me realize I turned up the speed a bit too much. Slowed back down and kept telling myself to focus on finishing each mile at just under 7:30 as best I could. Took the first course-provided maurten gel at 14.

Miles 15-23: Felt like incredibly even splits. I told myself I could pick up the pace at mile 20 but was too scared to really go for it. Told myself I'd do it after mile 23. Took gels at 18, 21 and 23 (18 and 23 were course provided).

Mile 24: I felt my hamstring get dangerously close to cramping and I started shifting weight towards my other foot. That worked for a quarter mile maybe and then my opposite quad also began to cramp. I walked through an aid station to make sure I finished the full gatorade. In a last ditch effort I also ate a gel (having just taken one a mile back). The cramping started to subside but I decided to keep even paces to avoid cramping at all costs and being forced to walk

800M to go: For the first time I felt like it was safe to let loose and see what I had left in the tank. My feet hurt but my legs felt strong still. Went up mount roosevelt and went into what felt like almost a sprint (but was probably much slower) for the last 200M.

Final time in the low 3:19s!

# Post-race

It felt amazing to finish this one. I PB'd my half marathon time as part of this full which just goes to show how much a single training block has improved my running capabilities. Very even splits and executing a negative split made me feel like there wasn't much I could have done better.

I think I'll take some time off the marathon (definitely <5 years this time) and focus more on the half. It would be amazing to snag a 1:25 half time before I revisit the marathon distance

I asked her to coffee within a few texts to each other and she was super excited to meet. We scheduled the coffee for a few days later and we kept in contact a lot and even she drove the conversation when I was nervous about being overbearing and messaging too much she would spark it up. We met for coffee and it went great, we had a great time together and ended up being there for a few hours, we left and just hugged at the end of the date. Before I had even gotten back to my car she had already texted me about going out again sometime and that she had a great time.  
  
I setup the 2nd date right away to go to a haunted house as she was really into like horror movies and Halloween in general. The week between we texted every day and continued to learn more about each other. 2nd date came and we had a great time together at the end of the date I kicked myself for not kissing her as she definitely looked like she went in for a kiss as I hugged her. Once I got home we texted each other a bit and setup a 3rd date, this time it was at her apartment and we were just going to make dinner and watch a movie at her place, also her dog had to like me so I had to meet him.   
  
During the week of texting again she had mentioned how she was looking at getting some fall flowers for her place cause she just put out all of her Halloween decorations so I figured I would get her flowers. I showed up to her place and brought her flowers, the date went great we made pasta and watched saw (I had never seen it and she poked fun at me on the previous date for not ever seeing the entire series) and we ended the night kissing. Next morning she had texted me how much she loved her flowers, how her dog absolutely loves me and is a huge snuggler like her and that she was excited to go out again, she had family visiting the next weekend so we planned for the following weekend to go hiking.   
  
2 days after the 3rd date we were texting and she just randomly stopped responding, didn't really think anything about it just gave her space, then the next day she apologized saying she got some bad news and was dealing with it, we talked a bit throughout the day and nothing seemed strange then all of a sudden she tells me she just is dealing with stuff and isn't ready to build a new relationship at this time. I told her I understand and I really enjoyed our time together but she needs to do what she needs to do but if she finds herself ready to build a relationship for her to remember me as I really enjoyed our time together. She thanked me for understanding and I told her I was still going to watch saw 2 and send her my critique because she hyped it up so much and she laughed and told me she looks forward to it. 

I am newer to the dating scene as I didn't date much in my early 20's because I was so focused on work and didn't care to be in a relationship but now I'm at the point that I want to pursue that. I honestly do believe her although my friends tell me she is just lying and she just isn't interested in pursuing a relationship with me and that she probably has someone else she is into. I am curious on other experience or perspective if I should just give her like a month or two and then just reach back out breaking the ice with saw 2 or something then asking her for coffee again saying it would be great to see her. I am not going to get hung up and just wait around on her necessarily because it had only been 3 weeks of talking, but we were vibing extremely well with each other I had thought and I also don't really seek out relationships that often as its just very draining so I could see myself not even going out with anyone else in a 2 month span.

Circuit A: 4 plugs along a wall on the right side of the main panel. Has 2 computers + 2 laptops and screens connected to it (home office setup) coffee machine, printer and a mini fridge. It is AFCI protected.
Circuit B: 1 plug in the hallway. Nothing on it usually, sometimes i will use it to test stage lights. Also is on an AFCI and is on the left side of the main panel. 

Now the weird thing that happens, a certain light with a 2R bulb inside is being tested on Circuit B (about 220W load) Circuit A trips for an arc fault condition. Keeps tripping randomly when reset, either within a few sec or min of being turned back on. Only when the light is unplugged from circuit B does A stop tripping. 

I have run much more heavy equipment on Circuit B and the computers are idle so theres almost no draw on Circuit A. So how does this stage light on Circuit B trip Circuit A AFCI protection!?

Somehow, this 45 minutes of television contains both Windom Earle dressed as a horse and BOB's ominous arrival from within the Sycamore Tree circle. 

Despite my fondness for the Peyton period, I must admit to my exhaustion with that portion of the show and a desire to once again chew on some surrealism. It's as if the curtains in the black oil are beckoning me as a viewer to return to a different period of the show. 

But let's talk about what we have here today. The Wheeler/Audrey storyline is mercifully brought to a close. I'm not even allowed to hate it, because I don't think it's technically out of character for Audrey. I just really hate Wheeler. He's not cool or interesting enough for a powerhouse like Audrey. 

Speaking of Audrey, I noticed that she and Ben Horne have a very close, warm relationship now. Seemingly in complete contrast to the way Secret History suggests she dismissed him. What goes wrong between them? I don't understand that development at all. 

This episode contains the final scene shared by Kyle MacLachlan and Sherilyn Fenn, and it's a total nothing. What a pity. 

Major Briggs returns to provide an old video tape about Windom Earle. Earle is sort of half-way to lunacy in it. Was it his revelations about the Black Lodge that drove him to madness? Pure greed? Maybe he's so manic because he thinks nothing will touch him once he uncovers that power, and so he feels totally free to do and act however he wants, because he thinks he'll be immortal or something. If so, that's extremely ironic because it means that the Black Lodge - through corrupting Earle - influenced Cooper even in his youth. 

It's fascinating how Laura Palmer has now become a mere footnote in a story about Cooper's destiny to confront the evil within him, something that has apparently been building up all his life. Do you guys think Cooper deliberately brushed off Annie's request to go bowling so he could persuade her to be Miss Twin Peaks (by building her confidence and teaching her to dance in the same area) or am I reading into it too deeply?

NOTES: 

* In fairness to Ben Horne, Hayward could've been a little more forceful in telling him to fuck off and leave his family alone. Where's the Hayward that shut Andy and Dick's little investigation down?
* 1970s mustache Ben appreciation!
* The real Bobby Briggs has returned, after a very strange backwards development for this half of the season. 
* I love the mayor's description of Dick Tremayne: ""Oh my God, this guy is British or Bahamian or something."" The mayor is an underrated character.
* Robyn Lively is insanely hot as Lana, and I am in constant awe of her sexy accent. Brilliant casting. 
* Are we meant to assume that Leo's captivity has forced him to reconsider his attitude towards Shelly?
* Interesting that Coop, Pete and a random lady had those handquakes. I like the idea that Pete is very receptive to the supernatural, even though we've never really seen that before. 
* If only they'd gone bowling, Coop and Annie could be chilling in town to this day. The smashing of the coffee cups right after they made their choice was a great directorial decision.
* ""What is the capital of North Carolina? Fat lot of good that'll do me..."" Lmfao Earle, you prankster, you! I love him so much. I'm gonna miss Kenneth Welsh like crazy. 
* Sometimes the show is so incredibly well thought through, and then there's stuff like the Dweller on the Threshold that they just straight-up abandoned. It's a pity. 
* Andrew's new sweater though. Incredible.
* How could Andrew possibly know how many digits the combination to the puzzle box has?
* I don't know if I've said it before, so I'll say it now: I adore how theatrical this show can be. The way the lighting changes and everyone around Cooper just freezes when the Giant turned up is so simple, yet so effective. I wonder if it's meant to convey a certain unreality, a little nod to the fact that this is all fiction (a dream?). 
* Outside of hyping us up for the final episode, what is BOB's appearance at the end actually supposed to mean? Why did he materialise in the circle? It's almost as if he's taking physical form but then that never happens. ",2,1729208695.0,twinpeaks,4,1.0,False

I have a few stories that are rough, I've had undiagnosed ADHD for all my 32 years and that creates some interesting situations. I'm also a female.

I will be keeping names out of it since there only me and two others in the story. It will be obvious to anyone that knows us both but truth hurts.

My most recent story worthy of tea time is still from like a bit over 5 years ago. I have to think kinda hard to remember the finer details how things were back then but to set the scene...

It was like 2016 ish in the beginning of it all... I had just come back to Arizona from living in Missouri a year or so ago (my daughter's sperm donor lived there, that story is for another tea time when I have longer to write it up, as a teaser my cheating ex called me and left a voicemail asking if I called Maury on him as they contacted him about being on the show in the end of it all. Spoiler, no I wasn't the one to call 😂😂 I wish I knew about the services that record a voicemails and digitize it for you as the flip phone it was on stopped working but back to this story) and attending Job Corp there I was about 24 years old I think.

I began to work at a huge call center AFNI and it was my first job outside of fast food. If you've ever had undiagnosed ADHD and or worked at a call center you can see that terrible outcome of my mental health already. I was social but in the worst ways, I had acquaintances but felt I lacked a real connection with someone and decided instead of making friends like a normal adult I need to start dating as before I had been single since before I left Missouri. 

I hopped on OK Cupid, I struggle with RSD too so digital dating was a must for me, being rejected is easier to stomach digitally. I chatted with a few people but never got to the point I wanted to meet up with someone. All I can remember is my exes profile said something about being a bearded wizard and Magic the gathering (yes, I'm proudly full blown nerd) so I reached out to him. We talked briefly before we decided to have coffee. I rescheduled twice out of nervousness but finally got the confidence to meet up. I should have known that him wanting to go back to his house was him being obvious about his intentions but I was too excited to have found a guy who had an extensive education (in the process of finishing up a PhD in psychology with a specialization in management), he had a far more stable family unit than I did and wouldn't ask me for money. 

I was in such dire need for support and security that I didn't believe at the time I could provid myself. I was just latching onto a man who I thought was going to be the best I could ever do, considering how every other relationship I've had was with obvious bums and people who cheat on me constantly. I saw him as my ticket to being normal lol 😂 but honestly he had the stability that was so attractive to me. 

Now I think about it I feel so bad for my younger self.. she was wired to be insecure.. Go away tangent... Thank you for you patience reading my mind word vomit.

Back to the story, so we begin to get close after and talk a lot. He's so nice and always gifting me things. The first few weeks were so nice but after that I wanted to refine our dynamic a bit more and give me some peace of mind. Well, that's the first red flag. He wanted to keep it open. For context, he is a bigger guy, married for a long time and was a total nerd in his youth so he never really got a bunch of attention and then is when I find out more about his last relationship. He was married, no kids but his wife cheated on him and they divorced not too long before our meeting so he wanted to explore. I felt for his situation so much I didn't think twice to agreeing. What really was happening though was I was so desperate to keep this guy who I've now cemented in my mind as the guy I could never get being a poor and neurodivergent fat girl that I ignored that he essentially told me that I'm on the same level as these random chicks he's sleeping with.. Eventually I grow a temporary pair of balls and tell him I need to know where we stand. He tries to explain how he doesn't want to lose me but just wants to take advantage of the attention he's getting from other woman since he never had that experience when he was younger... you know the story.. but I actually ""stood my ground"" 😂 just saying that makes me laugh at my old self, but I stood my ground and said I won't be around if I'm not number 1. Well we made it official, essentially it was the occasional three way, swinger party and girls going in and out while I'm not there (with confirmed STD testing, I can not stress enough that the only reason I did this was because he legitimately has a vetting process to keep himself clean and I respected the hell out of that. Drop of wine in a bucket of piss in hindsight but as I've said I was naive and thought basic human consideration was affection lol)

I don't remember much from the relationship honestly, I think it's one of those things that my brain is repressing for my own sake. But one detail I just remembered I'll save for the end, can't wait to share that. 

But now we are official! I think I've made a huge step to having a real normal life 😂 oh I was so naive.. I meet his family, integrate into it so easily. Felt so supported at his family gatherings, it was something I craved so much... Also got to know his friends and co workers. Met his girl ""best friend"" for years, eventually he tells me he's had a crush on her but they were never single at the same time. She's been in a committed relationship for a long time at that point. I know he still has feelings for her by the way he looks at her and talks about her but in my head I convince myself that it's lust just like the other girls. 

We have a decent relationship I definitely have some issues with getting all the stress and pressure of the relationship and my see saw of mental health leaking into everything else. I desperately try to spend more time with him but all that got me was losing my job over FMLA issues stemming from me trying to be with him and his family during Thanksgiving. 

During this time his car caught fire as we were driving back to our hometown coming from where is parents live, it's like 3 hours away so not too far but far enough your car being on fire could leave you in a bad spot lol Tangent: essentially he didn't recognize the sounds of his gears grinding together until the transmission literally popped and the car no longer had power. If I didn't get on my back to check under the hood he would have had us sit in the car and wait but I said no I need to check I think I smell something burning. I am super sensitive physically, probably emotionally too but whatever lol, so the whole time he was driving I could feel the car not acting right. I told him it's not good but didn't listen to me as usual, I played the ignorant side of the relationship despite my actual knowledge. So I get out once we're on the side of the road and he does too. I tell him to wait too so anything as I'm on my back under the front passenger tire trying to see and he opens the hood which floods the engine compartment with what??? Oxygen! What happens when a fire gets fed oxygen quickly but not forcefully and directly on the source of fire? Yeah.. I was pissed I started to yell that he wasn't thinking things through. To explain when he raised the hood the fire expanded quickly, with my face and body under the car he should have waited to look until I said it was clear, to be put more plainly for those who don't understand why I'm mad from the situation mechanically. I was hoping it wasn't electrical fire so we wasted our Starbucks pouring it on the fire, once that didn't work I realized it was all for not and just said that we need to start getting our stuff out of the car and watch the car burn. Which is what we did. We had to get a ride back with his sister's family. I remember having a 3 day migraine after that because the fumes from the car. After everything he said this is the event that made him start to question our relationship because I wasn't contributing money the way he wanted in his financial crisis, that he never even brought up to me. But I know I could be the one with the weird thought process and needing it to be laid out for me so not much judgement there just confusion.

Back to job loss, It was definitely AFNI HR who failed to do their job correctly with the FMLA, fuck you Susan.. I start looking for a job and get one shortly after (4-5 weeks at most) at another call center. Since my job loss it strained our relationship, he never told me till after but he was upset I never gave him money for staying at his house so much but he also never said that he wanted the help, and always invited me. I made 32K a year and he's making easily 5-6k a month. I looked up to him as the responsible one so I never even thought about it, I bought him stuff all the time so I thought it was a give and take but he preferred the paying bills form of money contribution.

With this foundation of problems that are popping up when she became single it was the perfect storm for them I think, I still have a small piece of myself that understands what he did and isn't mad but I think that's the door mat side of me creeping back in.

Then we find out that she just had her long time boyfriend drop the bomb he got another girl pregnant and is leaving her.... How this happens is in the WORST way too. She comes over for a card night, gets drunk, she kind of passes out on the couch. My boyfriend decided it's the best time to grab her boob. I can tell he's trying to get her to do something with with us or just them but she's too out of it to get up even though she's feeding into it making it clear it's not a forced thing. I'm watching a half a second and then say what the fuck and leave the room, she them said she has to use the bathroom. He follows me and while I'm still not able to express my what the fuck properly, She goes back and passes out in the living room and I tell him I'm staying in the room so if he stays out there I see where things are going... He goes out there a couple minutes but comes back but him leaving should of told me everything...

Why do I only see clearly when I'm actively angry... Recounting this is so frustrating lol 

But after a while he goes out to check on her and she's gone. He calls her and she left, I do not support drinking and driving but to me that was a huge sign how uncomfortable she really was so I lay into him saying he may gave up his friendship.

But that's not true as the following events unfold, I can't remember the entire time line for but I remember the order of events. 

She then soon after tells her boyfriend about what my ex did in a form of a confession and he comes back with the bomb of I've been cheating on you for a while and the woman is pregnant now so it's a good time to bring this up since I'm leaving for good after this..... He's a POS... I felt for the girl so hard that I stop feeling any maliciousness I had because I know that pain (foreshadowing of my next story I prefaced in the beginning of this except I was pregnant too) and I'm not going to kick her while she's down, not cool... I really try to live life with one rule, don't be a dick if nothing benefits from it. My impulse control says otherwise but I try.

Now I think of it, there was like a bit less than 2 weeks between when she became single and him dumping me lol no shame and you'll see that even more as we go along with this story so don't worry one of the worst things he's ever said and done to me is still coming up. These damn tangents keep popping up.. it's how my brain works and I struggle separating my writing voice from anything I write, I apologize if it's bothersome.

Back to it, so now she's single and grieving her relationship. She states cutting and speaking but I didn't figure that out at first but when I do it reminded me of when I was in jr high and would do the same thing so I had tunnle vision, I need to make this girl feel like she's got bedrock under her feet right now. She needs stable support. I tell my ex to invite her over so we can be with her if she wanted. We could play video game, board games, card games, eat food, cry, eat more food etc is more or less what I said. The first time we hang out I noticed her wrist, despite her also being a therapist in a master's degree program she was coping with the situation by cutting herself. No shame just confusing to me. My empathy kicked in so hard knowing the lost feeling that comes with self harm that I would have done anything she asked me... We spend the next few days together hanging out. I even have a moment where I say ""I'm lucky I trust *ex* so much or I'd be worried she'd take him from me"".... In front of all his roommates who later witness that exact situation play out. We then decided to bleach her hair in highlights (I've been doing my own hair for 15 years constantly, to keep it a bright purple. I'm not a professional but I can get it to look decent while not damaging your hair too much that it can't recover with a good moisturizing mask and a split end trim), I didn't do my best work as I'm used to doing it on my self only for putting a color over the blonde not doing it for highlights so they were chunky strips lol (she eventually dyes it all black or brown so I guess you could say I got a form of unintentional  revenge 😂😂) then we go out for ramen and she seems to be doing a bit better. She decides she wants to stay over and this is the biggest red flag that I now question my IQ... She passed out on the bed and my ex has a bad back from a car accident, he only had a full size bed and me and him full it up normally... I'm sure you can imagine where this is going... I whole heartedly wanted her and him to be most comfortable so I slept on the ground on top of two couch cushions.. after that I just keep trying to show her I was there and after she was well enough to go back to work I wanted to have one on one time with my ex so I stayed home from work one day and surprised him with that. He was actually angry.. after sitting in the bed I ask him if he even wants to be with me anymore... He's silent. I look at him and his face says it all. I breakdown and go outside, his roommates that have witnessed what I've been through actually comforted me more than he did that day... He never stopped texting ""someone"" that day. I was so pathetic I asked him if I could stay a few more days to make making my stuff easier...... I tried to do so much I'm ashamed of to get him to love me again that night..

I can't remember the context of how this came up but he asked me after he left me to act like we are still together one last time so he can go to the swingers party being thrown a week or so as he wouldn't want go alone as they strictly require a fully consenting couple and the females are really good at getting the okay before doing anything and he would have been kicked out if they knew how things went down. Luckily, I was aware enough that he was clearly using me again that I told him too fuck off. Lol I say that but I unfortunately really considered it to be close to him again... 

He told his family he left me because I was too co-dependent. I debated so hard unloading this on one of his sisters that I stayed friends with on Snapchat but I just felt the best use of my energy is moving on...

Of course, for those who are of the discerning type, I know you see holes in the story about my actions for two years. I know I'm not being held at gun point the entire time so I want to make clear I am not acting as if I had no choice in the matter. I wholly trusted him and chose to do that. That is only my fault and no one else's. I'm responsible for that worse situation just as much as I'm responsible for my current better situation. I was in no way a perfect partner. I love bombed in times of desperation that is very true. On days that I would stay home I'd have my laptop, my phone, my game console, and the projector on all at once. Playing Skyrim, watching Rick and Morty, using my phone to take notes if my random thoughts through the day.. I struggled with cleaning the house because I have always struggled with structure. I asked to borrow money when I want financial as responsible as I should of been, still owe him like $400 dollars from a couple of different things. I want to pay him off still too but COVID hasn't been kind to me and I'm still struggling. I had a family that would take a saint to accept.. mom had a traumatic brain injury from a car accident that she was found dead at but revived to be in a coma for 3 months very young and since it's been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. That was my primary guidance lol I love her and anything I say does not properly express the struggle that woman has with me. Now n days you see women in her position kill their kids from mental illness and lack of support. The fact that woman did absolutely everything she put to make sure that was taken care of is undeniable. But two things can be true at once and I was wholly unprepared for most of life and the things it brought. When I get really angry or really sad or really just any extreme of an emotion I would isolate, I'd struggle being open with him as he struggled not being a therapist when I was opening up to him.. and because he struggled with his boundaries I just couldn't.. he wasn't wrong I was very much co-dependent on him. It just hurts that that's what he's telling his family when it's so clear that he actually left me for another person to everyone else except for his family because all they have is his side... 

Well damn.. that was slightly more cathartic than I thought.


I haven't thought about that since I got with my current boyfriend a bit over 5 years ago. Thanks for listening and when I have the time to relive some more crazy shit I'll make another post about sperm donor tea. Maybe make some realizations will come to me about that all too. 

I'm going to go eat some Chinese food now for comfort, hope everyone has a good day :)

TLDR: I was a naive and slightly mentally unstable extreme people pleaser that thought a therapist could do no wrong. He strung me along with the idea of a meaningful relationship while leveraging sexual exploits as means to get my meaningful relationship but took advantage of me sexually, mentally and emotionally. It ends with him leaving me for his women best friend after sexually assaulting her while drunk after I then spent weeks comforting after her boyfriend left her for his pregnant affair partner when she admitted to him my ex grabbed her boobs. After that I unpack some of my own baggage in an attempt to clarify my perspective.",1,1729208238.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1g64kh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1g64kh4/im_chronically_late_contrary_to_what_people_tend/,"I'm chronically late. Contrary to what people tend to assume about late people, I am embarrassed by it and feel guilty. I just can't seem to figure it out...help!","I (30F) have been chronically late for most of my adulthood, regardless of circumstance. It seems to affect me in the morning the most, and I almost always make it to things later in the day on time. 

I show up to work often 10-15 minutes late - not egregious, but enough to be noticeable. I think people often assume that chronic lateness comes out of a lack of care, but I do actually really care and feel really bad about it, but a lot of days I see the clock as I'm getting ready for/driving to work and feel so crappy that screwed up *again*. 

Here's what I have working in my favor:
1. I hit snooze in the morning, put my phone on the floor and slide it across the room so I have to get up the next time it turns off. That's helped me get up instead of hit snooze a second time. 
2. I set my clothes out, set up the coffee maker, and pack my lunch the night before so I can wake up and go. I am also an evening showerer, so I don't have to worry about that as a factor. 
3. I go to bed EARLY. I know that I can take a long time to fall asleep, and I feel like I've actually mastered my bedtime so I sleep enough. 
4. I genuinely like my job (have a bad day sometimes, sure, but I like my work.) 
5. I have an alarm set for 5 minutes before I need to leave.

Here's what's working against me:
1. I really struggle with seasonal depression, and sometimes it feels like an avoidant behavior that I get ready slowly. I live somewhere very dark and wet in the winter and hate getting my day started sometimes. Trying to unpack that one still. 
2. I need to be at work at 7:00. a.m. and my commute is about 30 minutes. 
3. I swear time is different when I'm getting ready for work. In the morning I pretty much just get dressed, wash my face and do quick/simple makeup, but it feels like time FLIES in the 35 minutes I give myself. Even when I have shifted my morning routine time back, I feel like time flies in the morning.
4. I live alone, so I don't have anyone depending on me to get myself out the door. It's just at work that I feel the negative consequences. My supervisor is understanding and encouraging, but she does point it out and I feel embarrassed. Ultimately, too, my contract has very specific hours and I am not keeping it if I'm late. 

Again, I know it may seem like I just don't care or I'm not motivated enough, but I really feel like things derail in the morning and I don't know how to get them on track. I feel frustrated with myself and embarrassed. 

Tl;dr I'm chronically late in the morning, feel embarrassed and like I can't get it under control.

It had a somewhat dark mode, and the design was very minimal, sharp edges, almost like Pako style but not THAT minimal.

We’ve had a Bambino Plus for about 2 years and love it. Only issue is whenever I run the cleaning cycle, there’s always a puddle of water underneath the machine on the counter when it’s done. It takes a number of paper towels to mop up and I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong. 

I empty the drip tray before running the cycle and make sure it’s fitted back in correctly. I also place a bowl underneath the steam wand and portafilter. Neither the tray nor bowl ever fill up or overflow, so the water isn’t coming from there. It also never leaks during regular use and I make coffee twice a day.

1g64ik5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g64ik5/gf_f23_is_angry_that_i_m26_hanged_out_alone_with/,"Gf [F23] is angry that I [M26] hanged out alone with a female friend [F23], am I the bad guy? ","Hi folks, long time lurker and first time poster. My gf and I have been in a relationship for years now. While we have had our ups and downs, I’m totally dedicated and loyal to her and want to marry her sometime soon in the future, as soon as she is done with her higher education. I genuinely love her and see a future with her.

My female friend Sarah and I have been friends for the past couple of years, honestly as long as I’ve been dating my gf. Her family and my family are friends as well, and I have always looked out for Sarah’s younger brother and mentored him, as their father passed away due to cancer. Whether it’s providing career advice, writing letters of recommendation, job referrals, or even financially assisting the family at rare times, I’ve always casually looked out for Sarah and her family when I am able to. I was raised by a single mother and know personally how hard it can be. My gf is aware of me helping out this family in the past, and has met Sarah a couple of times but is by no means close to her in any way. 

Recently my gf went on a week long trip to Atlanta for work. During this time Sarah got into a car wreck. Luckily she wasn’t injured. We decided to hang out on the weekend and grab some coffee or boba and catch up, talk about some of the issues her family and her were facing recently, and see if I could do anything to help them out. We have hanged out in the past before but always in a group setting. 

On the day Sarah and I were going to hang out, I texted my gf about me having plans to hang out with Sarah. She asked if it was just going to be her, and I responded with “Right now yes, but her siblings might join like they’ve done in the past tbh.” I then asked “Is that fine with you” to which she responded “Do whatever you want.” 

Uh oh. I knew she was troubled if she said that. I immediately said “If this makes you uncomfortable I can cancel right now”, as well as “I just want to be transparent with you”. She kept responding with “No” and stonewalling me, saying she was fine. Eventually I just took her word for it, picked up Sarah, and we went to a cafe I enjoy 30 minutes away in a nearby city, where I paid for the coffee and we chatted. I updated my gf when I arrived at the coffee shop, telling her the name of the coffee shop (she never responded). After our conversation I updated my gf that I’m heading back to drop Sarah off, and I then proceeded to take Sarah home. I then texted my gf that I was going to go hang out with another male friend of mine and then went on with my day. 

My gf has come back from her trip to Atlanta and is now extremely upset at me for hanging out with Sarah. She is saying that I went on a date with Sarah and cheated on her. Her main argument is that I didn’t tell her that Sarah’s siblings didn’t come along when I picked her up so it was just us alone, that I picked her up and dropped her off, paid for her coffee, and went to a nearby different city but didn’t specifically mention I was going to a nearby city. Furthermore, my location via Snapchat was not on, but this is due to me having a week ago bought a new phone and I didn’t set up my location via Snapchat yet. 

After thinking about it, I can see her point of view. It does look bad. If that happened in reverse to me, where a man picked up my gf, took her out to coffee, paid for her drink, and my gf’s location was off, it would seem suspicious and I would be upset as well. It’s the perfect storm.  

I picked up Sarah and dropped her off since her car was totaled, and paid for the coffee since she’s going through financial hardship right now. I was just genuinely just trying to be a good guy and help out a friend, and have no romantic feelings whatsoever towards Sarah. I do however feel that my gf is going to far of accusing me of being a cheater and saying I went out on a date with Sarah. We were just hanging out and seeing if I can help her and her family out. Being accused as a cheater and her repeatedly saying I went on a date with her is causing me emotional pain and anxiety. I don’t think a cheater would announce he is going to hang out with a girl, provide some level of updates, and even say he can cancel the hangout if she’s uncomfortable with it. I even tried to give her a chance to communicate with me even before the hangout, which she refused to do so. 

I’m not excusing myself however. I could’ve communicated more clearly, let my gf know of the city I went to instead of just the cafe name, provided more updates throughout the time I was hanging out, and made it clear it was just me and Sarah. For these mistakes I do sincerely feel bad and own up to them, and have  apologized to my gf. I’m not trying to discredit her feelings, they are valid. But I’m still continuously hurt but what my gf is saying about me being a cheater and going in a date with another woman. I would never in a million years cheat on my gf, yet here she is accusing me of this.

We have taken some time apart to cool down and think. Am I being unreasonable here in saying that I’m not a cheater and did not go on a date with Sarah? Or are my gf’s accusations too much?

Any guidance, advice, or feedback are appreciated. I will own up to any mistakes I have made. ",1,1729207812.0,relationship_advice,1,0.67,False

For context I work regular hours in a coffee shop and I often crash throughout the day. I don't take naps everyday, but I take them pretty frequently and sometimes it'll mess up my sleep schedule for the next day causing me to take another nap. This doesn't always happen and I make it a point to hang out with my wife when I'm awake, but she is very anti-nap. She never takes naps, and if she does she's usually out for a long time. She didn't grow up with a family who almost regularly napped like mine did. This sometimes causes a divide because I'll want a quick nap and she'll want me to stay up and talk or play the game with her, which is great. I love doing those things when I'm not tired, but she really doesn't understand why I cant just stay up anyway. Sometimes she'll even question if its normal the amount of times I take naps (again, she takes 0 and I'll take like 2 or 3 throughout the week) and will even question if I'm healthy.

She is immediately there. Almost going nuts. She is very possessive and jealous. And I think this has killed me over the years. If I just looked in the direction of another woman she would slap me against the head. Or through something at me.

For years, I had dealt with Mark, my former manager, who was notorious for his mean streak. He belittled employees, took credit for their work, and thrived on creating a negative atmosphere. But just when I thought I had moved on, I found myself in a similar situation at my new job, working under a boss named Claire, who was charming at first glance.

In the beginning, Claire seemed like a breath of fresh air. She had a warm smile and would often bring in coffee for the team. Her compliments felt genuine, and for the first time in a while, I thought maybe I had misjudged her. I started to lower my guard, thinking that perhaps she was just misunderstood, like I had once believed about Mark.

One day, Claire praised my project presentation and even invited me to co-lead an upcoming initiative. It felt good to be recognized, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that I had finally found a supportive manager. However, I decided to document my thoughts using an app called Reclip. I recorded a quick voice memo about how I felt about Claire, capturing both my excitement and my lingering skepticism.

But as the days went on, Claire’s true nature began to emerge. She would make snide remarks during team meetings, subtly undermining my ideas in front of others. I remembered my Reclip recording and played it back, feeling foolish for ever doubting my instincts. It was a stark reminder that I had been here before; I couldn’t let myself be swayed by her momentary kindness.

Then came the day of our big presentation. Claire completely shifted the agenda at the last minute, taking credit for all my hard work while blaming me for any minor hiccups. The thrill I felt from the earlier praise evaporated, replaced by a familiar sting of betrayal. I was taken aback, realizing I had fallen for the illusion of her kindness.

After the meeting, I recorded another memo with my feelings of disappointment and frustration. I needed to remind myself not to let my guard down again. This time, I was determined to learn from my past experiences. I revisited my previous recording, where I had expressed my excitement about Claire, and it struck me how easily I had ignored the warning signs.

In the following weeks, I made a conscious effort to keep my distance and maintain professionalism. I documented every interaction with Claire using Reclip, focusing on her subtle manipulations and backhanded compliments. I shared my experiences with trusted colleagues, ensuring that I wasn’t alone in recognizing her behavior.

It turned out I wasn’t the only one who had noticed. Some of my coworkers began to confide in me, sharing their own frustrations about Claire’s erratic behavior. Together, we established a support network to navigate the minefield she had created.

Looking back, I realized how important it was to trust my instincts. Just because someone shows kindness doesn’t mean their motives are pure. With my recordings as a reminder, I vowed to never let my guard down again, no matter how charming someone might seem. Even the most evil people can put on a mask of kindness, but that mask is never permanent.",24,1729206850.0,ManagedByNarcissists,2,0.97,False

so, my question is: if when we substitute another syrup in an iced matcha, are they also half-dose pumps? i know with the shaken espressos, if a customer orders a shaken espresso with no classic and substitutes for, let’s say, toffee nut or white mocha, we would do half-dose pumps. but for iced/hot matchas, iced coffees, i’m not 100% sure. 

does anyone know? sorry if this doesn’t make sense but i hope i explained well enough. 

myself and my other partners weren’t sure. so i thought i’d come here and ask! let me know please! anything is greatly appreciated!",4,1729206400.0,starbucks,7,1.0,False

Besides, it's nice to give some fodder to the nameless, comment-less asshats that blow through our sub and have something to downvote (you're welcome)...so here goes.

I was in Private this am moving some Scrip (notice no ""t"") to a mule when Eviction Notice popped and I figured...why not.? It was early and the friends list was empty, save Boomer, who was in a different game.  I hopped in my fancy new set of OE/WWR T-65  and set up camp at the scrubber to make like General Custer and last as long as I could.  

My Q/E/AP Fixer was putting in work and a Vamps Elders Mark was on quick-swap to keep me topped off.  I was taking a canned coffee each minute and things were going pretty well.  To my surprise I only had to repair the scrubber twice and managed to complete the event solo for the first time ever.  Huzzah!

I realize that a lot of you folks have probably been doing this solo for a while but this was a first for me.  I'm rarely in PA and after I hit 100 on the Season I change my build from Bloodied to Solar just to change it up.  The new crafting system certainly helped with the T65 set.  I also know that there are less spawns, but don't whiz in my Wheaties here.  I did it!

The event had no sooner ended as I was proudly collecting all my stars and breaking down the glut of Mini-guns, Sledgehammers and the like when the top-of-the-hour Mutated event popped.  Guess what....EVECTION NOTICE again!  This time it was Freezing and that was tough.  I had to really work for that one, but pulled it off too.   It got a little hairy when the magazine ran dry and the reloads slowly suffered.  I certainly had a tougher time keeping them thinned out around the scrubber, but I made it to completion again.  Barely.

2 back-to-back solos felt pretty good as a personal first.  39 Legendary items in about as many minutes was quite the haul and I wanted to share.  Pant-suits for everyone!",4,1729206348.0,FO76ForumRefugees,1,1.0,False
1g63zr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g63zr0/is_my_fwb_catching_feelings/,Is my FWB catching feelings? ,"Just a warning.. I am aware of how messy this situation is. I (23F) feel like my FWB (40M) is showing signs of deeper attachment. 
Backstory from me- I’ve been in 2 serious relationships over the past five years. This is my 2nd “FWB” arrangement, as the first one got too attached. I’m a romantic at heart but have been clear about what I want to both of these men. I want to have my fun and experience new things before I settle because I know with my heart, It won’t be too long. 

I work with my current FWB. We agreed to keep things casual and just have fun. We also both agreed we only like to sleep with one person at a time to keep things clean/ less complicated. He said himself he has commitment issues and I made it clear I’m not trying to fall for anyone right now. Yes, there’s a significant age gap, but I can’t help being attracted to it. It helps the idea of FWB for me knowing the fact that he has a whole life built already ( teen children, ex wives, a home etc.). Whereas I am financially on my own, in an apartment with a cat lol. Backstory on him- He’s a known previous player, a natural flirt, and extremely attractive for his age.. I did assume this would be strictly physical. 

However, we’ve started spending the night together every other day since he lives far away. Recently, he expressed that he wants me around all the time. One night, after a long day, we had plans for me to come over.. We know what that means.. except after getting there, he expressed he was really tired and I told him I was too and let’s try in the morning. Didn’t happen. No bad vibes, he was just happy I was there and didn’t hint anything about sex. 

He often brings me coffee in bed, makes breakfast, and buys me food whenever he can because I’m trying to gain weight. He even offered to not flirt with other woman if it would make me feel less attracted to him.. that’s a lot. It’s hard to ignore these signs and keep things strictly physical. I know the best way to get clarity is to ask him directly, but I’m curious if others think this behavior goes beyond a typical FWB relationship? ",1,1729206285.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

#▌Main stories covered:

>- **[Q3]  BPI Q3 profit: ₱17.4B (up 29.4% y/y)...** **BPI** [BPI 142.50 ▲1.4%; 85% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=32694387806ffac8abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] posted a Q3 net income of ₱17.4 billion, up 29.4% y/y from its Q3/23 net income, and up 13.7% q/q from its Q2/24 net income of ₱15.3 billion. The Q3 result helped BPI set a 9M net income record of ₱48.0 billion, up 24.3% from last year, driven by “robust revenue growth” from “strong performance of net interest income” (up 22.2%), average loan expansion (up 18.9%), and increased net interest margin (+22 basis points to 4.29%). BPI also increased its non-interest income by 32.4% due to trading gains of ₱3.0 billion and fee income of ₱26.4 billion (up 28% y/y) from service charges, credit card fees, and “bancassurance” income. BPI’s stock is up 32% over the past 12 months, up 37% year-to-date, and is up 68% over the last three years.
>    - ***MB:*** It has never been more profitable for our country’s banks, and I don’t think that’s an accident. Banks have been raking in cash hand-over-fist from the interest differential that they charge on loans that are already signed at elevated interest rates, but also from the deep menu of fees and service charges that banks pass on to consumers for doing anything within their banking ecosystem. I’m not being critical of BPI specifically--its goal is to make as much money as possible within the confines of the system--but I am starting to question the priorities of the BSP as the banking system’s regulator and the agency in charge of the banking status quo. Remember when a previous BSP Governor said that he’d have to “bribe” the banks with RRR cuts in order to get fee waivers for small value transfers to help ease the burden on low-income Filipinos? Well, the banks sure got their jumbo RRR cut, but where’s the elimination of fees on small value transfers? Don’t get me wrong, I think it’s important that our banking industry is stable. We don’t need bank failures. But when banks don’t even lose money during the largest financial crisis of our lifetimes (COVID) and are hyper-profitable while the majority of the country struggles through the aftermath of COVID and the intense period of inflation, what’s the point of all this banking profit? Again, I do not expect any oligarchs or shareholders to act against their own best interests here by knowingly avoiding income that could be made. It’s the role of the regulator to balance the sliders in a more equitable fashion.

>- **[NEWS]  Alternergy preparing for REIT spin-off...** **Alternergy** [ALTER 0.94 ▲2.2%; 81% avgVol] [[link](https://www.bworldonline.com/corporate/2024/10/18/628919/alternergy-consolidates-land-assets/)] is contemplating the formation of a REIT to “raise additional capital for the group”. The company said that it is considering using its subsidiary, **Triple Play Land Corp** (3PLCo), as “a platform” for this future REIT offering and has restructured its asset holdings to consolidate “all of the real estate needs of all its project companies” under 3PLCo.
>    - ***MB:*** While the company has not (to my knowledge) provided an exact timeline for when this REIT listing could happen, I think my coverage of ALTER’s BDO TradeTalk (MB link) makes it likely that this could be a part of the company’s fundraising plans for development of its pipeline beyond its “500 MW by 2026” goal. As ALTER explained, it’s already nearly 70% of the way to achieving that goal, but it has a management team with a lot of investment banking experience that is looking to “reach far more than that” in the years to come. We know nothing of how this REIT would operate, but I imagine that it would be setup to collect lease payments from ALTER’s power plant organizations for the use of the land (similar to CREIT and PREIT). We don’t know if the REIT would hold the land itself or long-term leaseholds, or if there will be any kind of dynamic mechanism like CREIT uses to do a bit of profit-sharing with REIT shareholders in addition to the basic leasehold revenue. The timing checks out as REIT valuations will only increase as interest rates fall. I’m interested, but I’m going to watch ALTER to see how closely it integrates this REIT into its long-term development plans.

>- **[NEWS]  Ayala Corp sells ₱18B stake in GCash parent to Mitsubishi...** According to a report by [InsiderPH](https://insiderph.com/japans-mitsubishi-to-buy-gcash-stake-for-p18b-via-50-of-ayalas-ac-ventures), **Ayala Corp** [AC 717.50 ▼1.7%; 30% avgVol] is selling half of its stake in **AC Ventures** (ACV) to **Mitsubishi** for ₱18 billion, in a deal that values GCash at approximately ₱288 billion (~$5 billion). ACV owns a stake in **Globe Fintech Solutions** (Mynt), which in turn owns **GCash**. This deal is apparently a continuation of the transaction in July where MUFG acquired an 8% stake in Mynt for $393 million; it was conducted on the same valuation terms. According to InsiderPH, Ayala will use the proceeds of the sale to “retire loans it took to finance AC Ventures’ stake that matched MUFG’s entry in GCash last July.”
>    - ***MB:*** At that valuation level, GCash is worth about as much as **Chinabank** [CBC 60.15 ▼0.1%; 11% avgVol] and **UnionBank** [UBP 41.60 ▼3.0%; 107% avgVol] -- combined. GCash is a beast, but one that all involved have been very careful to slow-walk to market. We’ve been teased with an imminent GCash IPO for years now, and hyped up by public musings of a potential twin listing (here and in a foreign market). Mostly, though, everyone involved seems committed to growing and protecting GCash’s valuation. Each successive transaction establishes a new, higher, valuation floor for that Maybe Next Year IPO. Well, not this transaction: it’s at the same valuation as the last one, but you can feel the desire to protect the valuation in the insistence that this was just a delayed “continuation” of the previous transaction as a way to explain why the valuation has not grown in the intervening three months. It’s inevitable that GCash will grow and prosper; the big question now is more about how much of that growth we’ll be allowed to own for ourselves.

Souls and how they become Sentient Beings 

—-

Souls are the Seeds of Life and Sentience and they are Made and Flow from The Center of Sentience, the Connection Point between Physical and Spiritual Known as The Void

New Souls are born frequently but Old Souls have seen the universe countless times and will see the Universe until they join The Void at death, when sentience leave their bodies and the soul is stored in the central sentience connection point, their multitude of lives can be seen from a timeless position.

Souls Flock from this Central Sentience Connection Point of reality, known as the Void, towards beings with the capability to receive consciousness at any level.

Evolution occurred on this planet by chance
As it’s occurred and is occurring in dozens of other universes on dozens of different planets currently. It’s a semi rare event as it is early in this physical dimensions trillions of years lifespan before all the stars burn out and we gracefully move forward to another Dimension.

But until the day we leave this Dimension, we as humans are some of the first sentient species to evolve to space travel, it is our duty to find sentient life throughout the lands, skies and space, no matter the distance, no matter how long it takes and it is our duty to Help as many beings as possible reach full Sentience.

On our planet and others.

As our world grows humans will face challenges, if we face our challenges correctly and maintain a healthy environment for everyone we will eventually be able to cross the dimensional path, physically. If we do not maintain a healthy environment we will all die and kill this and any planet we make it to, leaving our Souls a Drift, Till they Can Reach life Capable of Sentience once again.

A brief on Sentience 

—-

Sentience, a topic that is nearly impossible to understand, as sentient minds can be in the simplest of creatures, a dog that protects its friends without worry for their own safety and an ant that only does what the queen asks are all Sentient in my eyes, and while sentience can be argued greatly in the physical world but if there is ever the hesitation a creature has sentience it should be the goal of all humans to protect and help. 

Sentience comes to ALL humans and it never leaves. once a human is born, their sentience begins to grow and develop

The Mental State of Being and The Modern ages 

—-

In our modern day and age we all get labeled down into Sects based on arbitrary things like skin tone, sex, gender and plenty of other idiotic factors, these sects are unhelpful and more often then not hurt everyone as a whole and need to be abolished.

Instead it should be based on ideologies 

From The Day We All Read This We As Individuals and as A Collective Need To Change and see things as it can help for the collective and not just the individual, cause if you help all…
You help the individual 

We As a Collective need to treat everyone as individuals so we can all work together as a whole.
We need to look past the Sects modern society has put people into, 
We need to create a sustainable future for our species so that one day we won’t be living in a present made from blood and ash.

No one individual or group should be discriminated Against for their Mental State, Skin Color, Cultural background, Gender Identity, Gender Expression, Sex or Sexuality.

An individual should be seen by their actions and their likelihood to repeat their actions. Not for the way their Physical State formed into this randomized physical plane

An individual should be seen for their Soul and Mind, Not their Body or Mental State

The mental state of someone may dictate a difference in temporary treatment of someone, such as in cases where a being is hostile and harmful to the Collective, but a Mental State should never be used to look down upon someone as we all deal with our own mental states daily 

As the Mental State is the way our Soul, physical minds, Consciousness, Dimensional environment and personal planes of existence all merge together to create a persons sense of self and and sense of the world, two things that can very greatly from person to person.

A person should only ever be judged for actions that harm others and the collective as a whole and while personal safety should be a concern and you shouldn’t by shit coffee right now 
If someone is murdering people they should be rehabilitated minimum if not put into the current 2024 version of prison you know shit holes with people tortured in them 


———
But also most prisons make more criminals so like that needs to be fixed 

So I need some good prison reform ideas besides treat them like humans, give them mental health care and only jail real criminals not the homeless and mentally ill.

The Mind, Body and Souls Balance with The Void and the Physical World 

—-


All minds can tap into The Void and alternative planes of existence, this can be done chemically with herbal remedies and chemical medicines or naturally through meditation and other methods 

However, depending on the mental state someone has, it can be debilitating for some people to enter The Void and changing planes of existence can be harsh and varies from person to person changing ones mental state rapidly from situation to situation can cause spiritual and mental whiplash 

Those with unfettered access to The Void often have Troubled mental states, if they are unable to handle the connection to The Void. Those with a physical mind connection to The Void, often suffer as The Void will tear their physical minds apart if the Void is being Contacted without warning or explanation.

Some Sentient Beings are born as Physical Connection Points with Uncontrolled access to The Void, which can be a burden on the Physical Being as a whole if they don’t learn to maintain a Flow with The Void Through Physical Means

Some Sentient Beings are born with only fleeting visions of The Void, A burden on the Mind and Soul as the connection will be interrupted and distorted by the Physical Minds Changing Plane of Existence 

However both cases where one is a near permanent connection to The Void and one is a spontaneous sporadic connection to The Void can both be managed by the care of the physical Body and Mind with help from spiritual connection to To Void and the help of Herbal Remedies and Medicines that Reside in the Physical World. All who suffer from the darker visions of The Void can be helped 

Outside of medicinal substances their are plenty of physical and psychological practices that can work as remedies 

Some Sentient beings only allow themselves visions of the physical plane they reside in. This is an example of coping with the harshness of Reality.

However another Form of coping is of those that are true with their existence and know to maintain the Mind and Body in the Physical Form while allowing their Mind and Soul to Flow in The Void when wanted or necessary.

Unfettered connection to The Void can fry a physical mind it is something only the Soul should connect with truly.

Temporary connection points can be made by the Mind, through certain Mushrooms, Plants, and other mind altering substances. Although these points that connect to the Void are fragile and often mix with other planes of existence simultaneously leaving the experience to be a mix of truth and fiction developed by the physical mind and the souls connection to The Void.

———

The Stance on Death

—-

The death of sentience is a troubling thing 
And should only be used to protect others from unnecessary death or hardship. 
Such as starvation in the form of hunting and farming to eat, or by killing another Sentient being that will greatly harm and Kill those around on mass.

All behavior can be expressed and changed, given the right resources and the proper amount of the time. The Amount of recourses it takes for a Physical Being to change depends on the Physical Being themselves stage in life and how many cycles an individual Soul has gone through.

All Souls are karmically neutral from creation in The Void, it is the development of the Soul and the Environment in which the Physical Being develops in that truly has the largest say on how an Individual Physical Being will turn out.

What is a God but The Universe The Void and How We Attempt to Explain it All

—-

While currently writing this in a state of both madness and cold sobriety, I have always wondered.
Why are there so many gods?

I believe I have learned why

There is the Central Sentience Connection Point or the Void which is a territory that Souls reside in once they no longer wish to be in a physical plane that is made by all sentient species. And any sentient being that believes in gods and goddesses and higher powers inadvertently create Spiritual Connection Points to The Void

These manifestation of the Spiritual Connection Points Can be seen as gods, these are just visions that derive their power from The Void and the Sentient Minds trying to Spiritually connect with a higher power.

By praying to a Spiritual Connection Point you can give it physical and spiritual power in any dimension or planes of existence they are allowed in.

Let's say that we've got our couple who have always had a hard time communicating- Alice and Bob.

Alice is at her lab station, entangling photons, sending the signal photons (isn't that an odd term in the no-signaling world?) to Bob, who is across the lab or in the room next door, or down the street, or somewhere truly Distant. 

Now Alice starts measuring her idler photons for polarization,  h/v, maybe throwing in some D's just to keep things interesting. 

She's measuring away,  flipping her coin, and Bob, wherever he is, hears the little bell that notifies him there's photons coming in. He measures them for polarization and starts seeing a random population of h's and v's and d's showing up... but he can't make heads or tails of them, despite knowing that they're somehow correlating with the measurements that Alice is performing in her lab. It's all just randomness until he picks up the phone and they compare notes. Then the correlations begin to make sense. He starts to understand. But it's frustrating. It's all random until they talk on the phone and he's never been any good on the phone anyway, so there's that.

But the no-signaling theorem holds that no meaningful communication can be transmitted through entanglement, that it would take classic communication to confirm the correlations. How's he ever gonna get her to go get coffee anyway?

Are we all on the same page?

1g63uv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1g63uv2/i_think_my_friend_has_been_poisoning_me_for/,I think my friend has been poisoning me for months and making me sick ,"I think my friends been poisoning me and making me sick for months. Im 29f. And my friend is 27f, I'll call her Amy. 

So back in February amy said she needed a place to stay so I offered her my spare room, shed been having issues with her bf and when they broke up she didn't have anywhere to go.. this was only meant to last a couple months but it's been 8 months  

I know all these things might seem like isolated events but just bare with me...

So living with Amy was good at the beginning, I didn't see her much because I was working and so was she but then I started having issues with sleep and the hallucinations started out of nowhere, headaches, hearing things and not able to concentrate for long periods. Like I can't even get through a full episode of a series some days, thinking people are at the door or that I'm dreaming when I'm actually awake. It's honestly scaring me. my dad suffers from schizophrenia and I know he struggles a lot with his own mind and these past months have felt like I'm falling down that same hole.

I've had to leave my vet job, which I absolutely loved. I've had to sign onto sick pay for the time being  because Im just struggling making day to day life functional. 
Throughout all this Amy makes me the occasional meal and drinks when I need them and some days I will feel like I'm getting to the end of a very dark tunnel and start to see some sort of light and just like that I'm gone again, down this dark hole in my mind. I'm talking to a therapist as regularly as I can and I've seen doctors and ive even had a head scan because I thought maybe I had a tumour ( well Google convinced me :') .. I don't have a tumour thankfully. 

So things started to unravel early yesterday morning after leaving to take the rubbish outside, I came into the kitchen where Amy was and I saw her stirring my coffee id just made 5 minutes prior, I asked her why she was doing that and she replied 'oh I thought the milk was off, it looked a little weird'. So I looked and I didn't see anything and smelt the milk in the fridge and it was fine.
I had a couple sips and just felt abit unsure for some reason, like I don't even know why I got paranoid at that moment but I'm glad I did. 
I poured it down the sink and she started saying how I'm being wasteful and overreacting and offered to make me another but I said I was fine and I got some juice instead. 

She's been doing this alot recently, like trying to make me feel bad about very normal choices I'm making. monday she made a big fuss over me not finishing the sandwich she made me because I thought it tasted funny. She was being short with me for the rest of the day and even brought up how ""there are kids starving and you're being so neglectful with your food"".. I'm really mindful of food waste usually and don't like to waste things in general, I know there's a real issue in the world with that and I don't care to contribute to it, but with me feeling ill all the time I'm not about to eat something that tastes off. 

Anyway, after the coffee yesterday morning, the day continues. 
I live in a maisonette and I have a balcony on the front of my place. I'm outside having a smoke around midday yesterday and I hear something break in the kitchen and she mumbles 'F*CK' as I rush in and see a broken glass jar and white powder all over the floor. She tells me not to worry about it and she sweeps it up. 
I just went back outside after realising I had brought the smoke inside with me. I went back to speak to her to figure out what needs replacing but she was in her room so I left it. 

A hour goes by and I end up using her laptop that was on the table,  to send some files through drop box (my laptop was at my sister's) when I'm almost finished doing what I'm doing, a notification pops up from her Facebook, she's in an active chat with this person on her phone. She's upstairs in her room while I'm in the living room downstairs. The chat reads..
Amy: the f*cking jar smashed, all the Xanax is gone can you sort me some more out please

Jamie: shit did Kyra (me) see?

Amy: yea I just played it off, she's not really asked much about it tbh but she almost caught me earlier putting it in her coffee. 

Jamie: listen I know your ex said all those things but I just don't know anymore, I've had conversations with her a few times now and shes not once mentioned it she said she's only met him a few times and it's always been while you were with him. Maybe you should just ask her out right if shes slept with him and look for a reaction. I just think this has gone a bit far. I know you're hurting but I think it's time to stop

Amy: yea ok I get you. I'll ask her. 

A new chat opens with another person...
Amy: hey, can you sort me any Xanax out please?. I'm just really having trouble sleeping

I got my cat in her carry case and messaged my sister to come pick me up and I'm staying here at the minute and hoping these issues I've been having just fade away with some time and I can have my life back.  

I've reported her to the police and said I'm unsure how long it's been happening and other than the messages I don't have any proof,  it only proves she tried to and failed with the coffee. They've removed her from my house and I've heard she was dropped  at her mum's not long ago. 
Im sure if they search her laptop they will find more than what I stumbled on. 

Is it crazy of me to feel some relief that all this is a result of being drugged and not that my brain and body are failing me?

I've also reached out to Jamie and he hasn't said anything about the drugging, just that her ex used to get mad when she would talk to me, and the day she was leaving him he said 'oh and Ive been sleeping with kyra for months, so good luck living with that tramp, trust no one' indicating I've betrayed her, when I've never even seen the guy without her let alone touched him in any way. It's all just crazy behaviour. Like how do people like this just walk among us, pretending, masquerading and conniving behind our backs. It's truly haunting. I've never intentionally set out to hurt someone and it's hard to understand someone that will, with just a little push to do so. Weird ",26,1729205906.0,TrueOffMyChest,15,0.93,False

I know there’s a lot of info out there about how babies respond to us when we react in this situation.

I guess I’m wondering if it’s okay to wait to react until they react, and then respond appropriately. Like if they cry pick them up and hug them, or if they’re okay engage and affirm them. Or if I should do something like “Oops!” Or “yay! You bumped your head!” Do they actually need the input from us to react themselves? ",1,1729205862.0,Mommit,3,1.0,False

Being a SAHM wasn’t by choice by the way. 

But is it unreasonable to ask my husband that we hire a paid nanny to help around the house? 

So I can, for instance: poop in peace, drink a cup of hot coffee in its entirety to the point it’s still hot at my last sip of it, cook a meal without “sharing” the kitchen with kiddo, find a hobby that’s not related to house cleaning or child rearing.

We don’t get frequent dates. His work schedule doesn’t allow it. 

I NEVER get a break because I have mommy duties 24/7 Monday - Friday since hubby is only home on weekends. In other words he is physically GONE from the home five days a week. And let me emphasize I get ZERO breaks unless I put the TV on (and that’s a whole other issue of self inflicted mom guilt). I have ZERO help with extended family also. 

It’s been over 2 years like this. And I feel like I don’t even know who I am. 

I asked about hiring a nanny to help me and it’s being met with resistance. It should be noted: I don’t need the nanny to clean. I can do that myself. I just want a f*%#@&ing break twice a week. 

Is that so much to ask?
