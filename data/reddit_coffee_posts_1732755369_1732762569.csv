1h1m13b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1h1m13b/how_to_approach_comment_made_by_brothers/,How to approach comment made by brothers girlfriend after I paid for help. ,"For the last month I’ve been financially helping my brother and his girlfriend because neither of them work. (She refuses to work and he quit his job to be closer to home for her, he’s currently looking for a job in town) Today my car wouldn’t start because of the cold weather and I was in pain from a medical procedure I had this morning,  so I asked him to take me shopping since I know they’re just at home anyways and I figured I would pay him for the help. I didn’t get much things but I had 2 jugs of juice, a cup of coffee (I paid for coffee for all of us) and a couple other small things. I had given him $40 for the help and to cover gas for driving me. When we got back to my place his girlfriend had made a comment about getting my dad to come help (take things in) and then told my brother to stay in the car instead of helping me take things inside. I felt SUPER caught off guard about this he turned to ask me if I needed help, she again said “stay in the car” I just said out of anger “I got it” grabbed all my shit and juggled it in my arms and got out. I’m VERY annoyed and want to say something but don’t really know how to approach the subject without being a bitch. I expected help especially since I paid for their coffees plus paid him $40 for help. 

How do I set the boundary that if I pay for help I expect that it be until the end and make a comment about what she said was uncalled for an inappropriate considering I PAID for him to help me. It makes me never want to ask for or help them again. ",1,1732762027.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

What I'm looking for: 
I would love someone who will let me be clingy, respond in a timely manner (or let me know that you're away/busy), have a dark sense of humor, and is open and honest, I tend to prefer thick body types but I'm more into your personality.

1h1lrjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MultipleSclerosis/comments/1h1lrjz/lumbar_puncture_my_experience_positive/,Lumbar Puncture - My Experience (positive) ,"Hi everyone,  
I thought it might be helpful to share my experience with getting a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) for those who still need to go through the procedure. Hopefully, this will help ease some of the anxiety you might be feeling.

Before I had the procedure, I looked up everything that could possibly go wrong, read through forums, and prepared for the worst. Needless to say, I was *terrified*.

Here's how it went:

**Preparation:**  
In the days leading up to the procedure, I made sure to prepare everything to create a cozy, stress-free environment for myself at home. I cleaned my bedroom, changed the bed sheets, bought myself flowers, and prepped healthy meals that I could easily heat up in the microwave. I also cut up lots of fruit (oranges, apples, etc.), stocked up on Hydralyte drinks, and kept about 10 bottles of water (1.5L each) within arm's reach of my bed. I also made sure I had pain medications (like ibuprofen) on hand, a phone charger, and plenty of things to keep me occupied, such as books, my laptop, and prepped podcasts to listen to.

**The Day of the Procedure:**  
I was very fortunate to have a friend drive me to the hospital and back home afterward. If you don't have anyone who can help, I definitely recommend booking an Uber or taxi. You won’t be able to drive yourself afterward, and attempting to do so could lead to complications. We were at the hospital from 1:30 PM to around 4:00 PM.

I was absolutely terrified and, as someone who already has an anxiety disorder, I was far from relaxed. But it’s important to remain as calm as possible during the procedure, as moving can increase the risk of complications.

I’m not a fan of taking medication, but I knew I needed something to help calm my nerves. If you feel the same, I highly recommend discussing it with your care team beforehand. I called them before the procedure and let them know about my anxiety. They gave me a 5mg Valium tablet (which I’d never taken before), and I think it was a lifesaver. It helped me relax my muscles and calm down. The doctor who performed the procedure was wonderful—very calm, patient, and reassuring. He mentioned I was his fifth lumbar puncture of the day, which honestly helped to ease my anxiety (or was it the Valium? 😅).

**The Procedure:**  
I had to lie on my side in a fetal position. Don’t hesitate to ask the doctor if you need to adjust your position to make it easier for them. If you’re overweight, it might be harder to find the right spot, so try to assist them as best as you can. I’m fairly slim, but I still had to adjust my position a couple of times to help the doctor find the right spot.

Once they found it, the doctor placed a piece of clear foil on my back (I felt a bit like an early Christmas present, haha, definitely the Valium at work!). Then, they inserted a needle with an anaesthetic. It wasn’t painful, but it was definitely uncomfortable. I couldn’t see what was happening, and it felt like the needle was going deep into my back. The doctor pulled it out and repositioned it, going a little deeper this time. It wasn’t painful, just uncomfortable. After I told him it hurt a little, he adjusted it and it was fine.

Suddenly he said, “Yep, that’s the right spot. We’re starting to drain the fluid. The worst is over.” I was honestly in shock. I still thought he was putting the anaesthetic into my body but apparently it was already the real deal. It all went so quick!!!  All that anxiety, all the anticipation, just for *this*? It wasn’t bad at all! I’ve never had acupuncture, but I imagine it might feel something like that. On a pain scale from 1 to 10, I would rate it a 3. As a comparison, when I had blood drawn and a needle put in my vein, that was more of a 5 (it really hurt!). I'm such a baby when it comes to blood tests.

I didn’t even feel the needle coming out. I asked the doctor if it was out, and he just smiled and said, “Guess!” It was out.

**Recovery:**  
After the procedure, I had to lie flat on my back for an hour in the hospital bed. During that time, I listened to meditations to calm my system down. I also asked for a medical certificate for work. I’d read that you're supposed to rest for at least 24-48 hours after a lumbar puncture (and my neurologist had told me I wouldn’t be able to return to work the next day), but they only gave me a certificate for the day of the procedure. They suggested I return to work the following day, which didn’t seem reasonable to me. Please advocate for yourselves! I stood up for myself and asked for a full week off. They refused but at least agreed to give me a certificate for the next day, so I immediately booked a phone appointment with my GP to get a certificate for the rest of the week. 

**Post-Procedure Care:**  
After lying down for about 45 minutes, they tried to get me out of bed. Be sure to advocate for yourself here too - apparently it's really important to stay lying down for at least an hour after the procedure. The hospital staff was lovely, but they obs are constantly on a tight schedule.

Once I was allowed to sit up, I walked with my friend to her car, gulped down a coffee with a double shot and then lay down in the back for the 40-minute drive home. I didn’t experience a headache or pain at any point.

At home, I went straight to bed, drank a lot of fluids and rested. I stayed in bed for the next 24 hours, trying to sleep as much as possible. For the first night, I tried to lie on my back, but after that, I alternated between my back and side, being careful to keep my spine straight. I drank at least 4 liters of water a day, nourished my body with healthy meals and I only got up to use the bathroom or heat up food. I took it easy and stayed in bed for 48 hours even though I felt absolutely fine after the hospital.

**Conclusion:**  
In the end, my experience with the lumbar puncture was very positive. It was an optional procedure for me but I wanted to make sure my neurologist had everything they needed for an accurate diagnosis.

**Takeaways:**

* Prepare your space at home: Make it cozy, have healthy food and snacks, plenty of water, pain medication (just in case), coffee and fruits available
* If you have anxiety, ask for something to help relax you before the procedure (I got Valium)
* Rest for at least 48 hours after the procedure. Stay flat, only get up to go to the bathroom & for food
* Make sure someone is nearby who understands what you’re going through, just in case complications arise
* Take at least two days off work to relax and recover

That was my personal experience with the lumbar puncture. Good luck to everyone who has to undergo one in the future - remember, many people go through this procedure, even babies, and the chance of complications is very slim if you're prepared and take care of your body afterward ",2,1732761176.0,MultipleSclerosis,0,1.0,False

As a young 22 year old, I was excited to be an intern after college at a resort in Andaman. It was the lean season and my friend's father owned the resort. He practically made me incharge of most things, considering their lack of funds to manage it. 

Despite the weak pay, I loved my job. I did it with passion and sincerity. It was a rainy night as usual and I was tallying the accounts in the cafe. We had one or two people in the resort, sitting at the cafe, sipping coffee when Miss/ Mrs. ______ , one of the most famous actresses in town, a siren and a sweetheart walks in. She was dripping in rain and was on vacation to heal herself after a string of flops and a divorce. She was looking to heal herself and have some fun too, being lonely for quite a while now. 

And here starts a seductive and sexy game that takes us around the island. Your character could ask me to be your tour guide- take you to caves, take you on boat rides, swim together in the beach and go on cafe dates.

I plan to go see the Nutcracker soon. I’m in the exciting process of writing three novels. I started a journal. I know the work I want to do with my life; working with chubby-cheeked infants and toddlers. I love polka dots and cardigans and have allowed myself to. I am scratching the surface of my couple dozen thrifted books I want to read and annotate. I am reigniting my former spiritual and theological passions. I still feel like crying all the time and lying in bed, but I have accepted that it is a part of who I am. Maybe my mental health is not a character flaw, but a result of my character existing in a world that I won't ever fit very well into. As I try to remove the cookie-cutter standards off of myself and open my mind to a new lifestyle, I remind myself that it is okay not to want anything but to exist peacefully and enjoy a cup of coffee.

been living with who i think is the love of my life for the last 3 years to which im deeply grateful as its been a hell of a beautiful journey,
last year our nearly 2 year old cat passed away and i haven’t been the same ever since, i had the chance to grieve before as the pandemic took both my grandparents that were still alive but nothing like losing a child like figure to me, my cat was my world.
this year we opened the doors to our house to a dear friend who needed a place to stay, things are going kind of ok, but i don’t feel like going through another year with him as it has weakened my relationship with my fiancée and us not really clicking, now i don’t know how to speak to him about this and it’s really troubling me.
not really going through my best of times with my partner and it’s been tough, having to reach for deep patience somedays not to throw everything away, not really having a meaningful conflict but wearing us down in the long run.
putting all of my external things aside, i feel extremely frustrated about my life choices, battling a severe weed addiction, somedays forgeting a lot of important things, reaching for it again just to feel numb and dont think about all of this things, multiple times a day everyday, just wanting to feel faded, like im not even here, having a mediocre job as a guy in a coffee store, not going anywhere with my career choice as an artist, feeling like im not enough for anything or anyone, somedays i don’t even want to feel anymore, i just want to stop thinking, maybe even just let go of my life,
i know my troubles aren’t that big, i know i can make a change in my life but i know i won’t be changing the way i feel about myself and thats wearing down all my close relationships
sometimes i wanna let go of my dream of living off my art, maybe someday it’ll make me feel better even tho i know it will break my heart

1h1lhym,https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1h1lhym/overcoming_notebooklm_limitations_for_learning/,Overcoming NotebookLM Limitations for Learning,"Hi, just wanna share my experience with NotebookLM, likely most of you have also faced similar frustrations. No doubt its a great tool but over time, I have realized its more suited for research than actual learning. 

Here are the major issues I encountered and how I found a workaround.

**1. One Podcast Per Notebook**

The truth is trying to compress several notes into a single podcast is not practical, because so much important details will be lost, which is extremely counter-productive and the other option of creating separate notebooks for each chapter of same book, only further complicates study revisions. But with MemflixAI, every notebook is broken into multiple related chapters, with each chapter linked to its own resources (like documents, text, videos, etc.). Plus, each of these same chapters, can play multiple types of podcasts like interviews, debates or motivations.

**Before going to the next, feel free to listen to some of the MemflixAI generated podcasts and share your feedback, thanks!**

[MemflixAI Demos](https://reddit.com/link/1h1lhym/video/kscnyjppwj3e1/player)

**2. No Built-In Podcast Player**

It’s one thing to manually download podcasts every time, but it’s an even bigger hassle to later organize them into related collections and playlists. MemflixAI solves this problem with a built-in player that automatically syncs your podcasts with your notes, allowing you to play them seamlessly in the background while you're on the go.

**3. Limited Podcast Styles & English-Only**

The two-host chit-chat format in NotebookLM felt limiting for me. I personally prefer more dynamic formats, of which MemflixAI offers a wider range of engaging options, including host-guest interview sessions, heated debates for balanced understanding, and much more. Additionally, it supports over 140 languages and even offers multiple accents within the same language, with voices graded by percentages based on their refinement, providing a more authentic listening experience. For best results, select voices graded 100% refined.

**4. No Flashcard Support**

What good is learning without revision? It’s the most practical way to retain knowledge. Learning without revision is like pouring water into a basket—nothing sticks. In MemflixAI, when you upload your source materials, it automatically generates study guides and flashcards from your notes with support for spaced repetition to enhance knowledge retention. It also features a scoring assistant to grade your answers and a knowledge assistant to clarify areas you want to dive deeper for better understanding.

**5. Limited Interactivity**

The default Q&A feature in NotebookLM is too basic and lacks depth. In contrast, MemflixAI offers a more interactive experience, providing multiple variations of open-ended questions, multiple-choice quizzes, follow-up interview questions, and even evaluating and correcting my responses. This has made my study sessions more effective.

**6. No Progress Tracking**

Without a way to track my progress or set reminders, staying motivated was challenging. MemflixAI solves this with built-in progress tracking, goal-setting tools, and reminders that keep me on track. These have been indispensable in helping me stay focused and motivated throughout my learning sessions.

**7. No Mobile App**

NotebookLM is web-only, which made studying on the go a real challenge for me. As someone who loves to learn while commuting or during downtime, this was a major inconvenience but with MemflixAI, the mobile app has been a game-changer. I can access all my learning resources anytime, whether I’m at home, on the bus, or even in a coffee shop. It’s incredibly convenient and has made my learning routine more flexible.

**And the best part? It’s FREE! and available on both App Store and Play Store.**

If anyone has faced similar limitations with NotebookLM or has tried MemflixAI, I’d love to hear your thoughts! 😊

My friend has a baby that’s 5 months older than my daughter. Her son is a little over 1 and my daughter is 9 months old.

She called me on Monday and asked me to watch her son on Wednesday from 10 am - 1 pm. She told me she would pay me and she was desperate because her, the father and her mother were either working or busy. I said of course I would be honored to watch him but didn’t really reply about her paying me bc I didn’t know what to say. 

Prior to this, I’ve been posting babysitting ads trying to make some of my own income. I am a stay at home mom with no support from family other than my boyfriend, my daughter’s father. 

Wednesday comes - I watch her son at her house with my daughter. It’s going great but then an hour or so in it becomes not an ideal situation bc the father decided to come to the house with his friend (they were supposed to be in the city that day running errands) and there two dogs are running around knocking over my daughter and causing havoc and the father of the boy and his friend are playing loud music so the babies are overstimulated. Nap time comes her son is screaming bc he wants his father but his father has to leave by nap time. I end up staying an hour later on my own accord bc I finally get him and my daughter to both nap so I don’t want to disturb my daughters nap. the boys father comes back around 1 when he was supposed too but my daughter and I end up leaving at 2. I would not be expected to be paid at all from 1-2 as I stayed on my own! 

After I left , her and I texted a bit - I updated her on her son etc. and she asked for my Venmo and I didn’t reply to the Venmo part bc I was busy but I replied to other stuff about her son. So she said something like let me atleast pay you enough for a coffee or something so when I was freed up I sent the Venmo but said something like “please don’t feel like you have to pay me a lot or what you would pay a babysitter. I want to say I 100% will do it for free but I could really use the extra money right now. When im in a better position I’ll watch him for free all the time of course!”

She paid me for watching him fairly. more than what I would of wanted or asked for but I just feel so guilty accepting the money bc I consider him like a nephew. even though I need the funds desperately and she offered to pay. I still feel guilty like I made watching her child a business transaction. When It wasn’t totally that bc I loved spending time with him and seeing the two babies play. I hope she doesn’t think I just care about the money. Ugh am I over thinking it? Have you ever asked a close friend for money for babysitting there child?  ",1,1732760101.0,AmItheAsshole,3,1.0,False

He's 2 years old now and he's been by my side since day one. My ex gave him to me when we split up. It was her dog, but she could see the bond we had. We're still very good friends. Sometimes I stay over at hers with my son and bring the dog. I sleep on the sofa but doggy goes and sleeps with mom.

In many regards he's like our child.

He is so intelligent. My brother is a police officer and he said they would pay 3000 for him. Nope, sorry, you could offer 10 million and I would still say no. He's my boy.

He's brought me through difficult times. Right now hes asleep on my legs. He has to be by me. He goes everywhere with me, and helps me feel less anxious outdoors because the focus and attention is on him.

We've walked miles together some days.

He's obedient. And he knows a lot of commands and tricks.

I'm teaching him to find things at the moment. Just little things, and giving him praise and treats when he finds it. He loves the game, he would play it for hours if he could.

His tail has resulted in many disasters, including coffee over the macbook. And knocking paint over and walking around the house with it on his paws. That was hilarious

Since he was a pup I've made him earn everything. Treats and food. The only thing I don't do it with is water. When I'm doing his food he will lie down, wait for me to finish, and then I'll have him do a trick. The current trick is standing up and touching my fingers. He can stand now.

I'm just fascinated with his intelligence. It blows me away.

On walks he has a fascination with walls. He sees a wall and he jump. He jump some so high I have to lift him off so he don't damage his legs. But he does this all the time, Going to invest in a pole so he can do some controlled jumping.

I've noticed these dogs require a lot of attention. Their brains need to keep busy. They love tug of war. He goes mad jumping at sticks.

I didn't know a dog can bring so much love and joy. He's perfect. He was hard work as a pup but I wouldn't change him for the world. Now he's completely relaxed.

I thought he may have separation anxiety, but when I leave him alone in the house he's fine. Most times I take him with me wherever I go. He loves the walking.

Funny story. Few weeks ago I cooked a batch of chicken to store in the fridge to snack on. I left the room for 10 minutes while they cooled on the side. He had them all! Which is surprising because prior to that he doesn't touch anything in the house that isn't his. He loves chicken.

Here he is sleeping on my leg.

One the RPCS3 settings post I made in this sub a couple months back still holds true and better (at least on Nobara, Manjaro and Endeavour OS under most desktop environments) on Lunix. I've also found that Lunix (at least manjaro at this moment) can run the EA app .exe for the launcher and game. 

How to do:

1. Download EA app installer 

2. ""pamac build lutris"" , then passwords and installing

3. run lutris and click add game from windows .exe option

4. select ""EAappinstaller""

5. Install and login 

6. Install mercs2

7. Find games in your home folder (again lunix) 

8. Open and use search function to search ""Mercen"" or something similar where it will pull a small list 

9. Go to Lutris and add game again this time from the bottom option ""Game already installed"" 

10. Go through options and set the game executable to the location of the previously searched mercs2 .exe 

11. Shortcut will appear on Lutris 

12. Launch

13. ???????????

14. Profit

For real though this works. For clarification just comment. Had to find a non emulator method after spilling the whole ass cup of coffee on the laptop. This ended up working. To be honest it runs hella fast for being a 350 dollar AMD/Ryzen/Lenovo from Walmart. No stutters, consistent max 1080p graphics. Again though this does require a Lunix or BSD based build. WINE/Proton are necessary and tbh idk if lutris has it's own stuff on top of WINE that made it act right, so will say Lutris is a must until further testing at a later date when I build a BSD rig.",2,1732759857.0,MercenariesGames,0,1.0,False

(I am 31m)

LONG POST. TLDR at bottom. 

So I do an art club/group with 11 other people, and four months back a new guy (19m) joined. I would consider myself acquainted with the other members of the club, but he and I became ‘friends’ very quickly. Which is weird, because of the age-gap, but I tried not to think of it because we got along so well, and it’s rare for me to connect with someone these days. 

We’ve met outside of the meetings multiple times a week in the last few months. One time we went to the museum near us for a quaint (platonic) study-date and also had dinner at a fancy restaurant that I could barely afford, and it was likely one of my favourite days out of my whole life. 

But two weekends ago I started catching feelings for him. I feel really disgusted with myself and have 0 idea how to handle it. I have a therapist but I’m even scared to tell her, because I am worried she will think me a pervert. 
I’ll give context: we were in the park doing sketching of each other. There’s this weird twisty bench that allows us to face each other so we could draw each other. There was a brief moment when I was sketching him that I felt a flutter in my chest, which was short enough, but made me feel uncomfortable. Then, for the remainder of the drawing session, I slowly realised how much I ‘like’ him, and was very confused. Like the universe knew my stress in that moment, when we finished and traded drawings he liked mine so much that he hugged me, which made my chest flutter even more. This sounds romantic, but I am aware that this is how I have seen predators talk to justify themselfs. We grabbed coffee in a cafe and I attempted ignoring what happened at the park but couldn’t. I had to admit to myself I had feelings for him. 
On the night when I got home, I couldn’t sleep because I thought I was a creep or that I was a predator. I decided to ignore it and try to forget, because I did not want to jeopardise our friendship. For a few nights this was the same.

The next time we met was in the week after work, when he and I had dinner at our favourite restaurant. This was terrible awful timing because of the connotation of going to a restaurant with someone, and I considered dropping it but decided not to because he expressed an interest in us going for ages. When we got there I actually had maybe an hour of peace where I was distracted by our conversations. We got dessert, and it went to shit all over again when he noticed a nick in my hand, and literally held it to inspect it, which started the flutters again. I ate really quickly, we split the bill, and drove him home and cried all night.

We are supposed to go watch something at the theatre this weekend but I can’t go. I told him that I’m ill and he seemed fine about it, but I have a lot of thinking to do. I’m not sure whether to talk to my therapist about this, or if I should isolate myself. I have even considered staging an argument with him to ‘break off’ from him. Because I’m anonymous, I really do think I love him, but I know I shouldn’t and that it’s extremely immoral and unexplainable. 

Where do I start in unpacking this?
I’ve posted this in multiple places to get a wide breath of advice.

TLDR: been catching feelings for a younger friend for a couple of weeks, and I find this attraction disgusting, and I hate myself. But I don’t know where to start in getting help or figuring this out.",0,1732759845.0,helpme,6,0.33,False

She ghosts fairly often for up to 2 weeks (total time we've been talking about 3 months now but only like 3 actual 1 on 1 hangouts). I'll reach back out, and we will do something together like hiking. Recently, we got coffee, and I told her I have been feeling pretty bad lately, and it's because I have grown to have feelings for you. She took that pretty well but no response other than ""i dont really know much about you,"" and we hung out for a while longer. Later she said she had the whole week off this week, so I reached out to ask if she wanted to go on a hike and told her sorry for being weird at coffee, she said maybe not today (it's cold and a bit of rain). I then asked if she wanted to cook tomorrow for Thanksgiving (she said she didn't have any plans last time we talked). I haven't heard anything from her since that text.

Hey, I feel like I'm someone you can't be open and honest with. I wish to be someone who you feel comfortable sharing your honest opinion with. I can't force you to share your thoughts or opinions. You also have every right not to if you want to keep them to yourself. One thing in particular, I feel as though I'm nothing, either completely out of mind or intentionally left in the dark, ghosted. This is probably why it is so painful as my feelings have grown. If someone doesn't want to do something, I'm always extremely grateful when they share that with me, even when it's about me (especially when its about me, that takes courage). Sorry I couldn't say this in person, I really tried, but I lost my voice and thoughts completely. It was hard as I'm worried about hurting your feelings, I do care about you. I am glad I was able to say what I did with your help motivating me. I do really want to hang out this weekend, something fun, goofy, weird even!!!

My ex and I were together for about two years in our early twenties. She had recently got out of a relationship and I had been single for a long time. She didn’t talk about her ex much but when she did it was mostly just her calling him lazy and talking about how he wouldn’t even shower, just lay around playing video games.
Our relationship was very unhealthy; we didn’t have chemistry and she was emotionally abusive (laughing at me when I finally came out to her as bi and telling me it made sense why I “wasn’t good at sex” because I was “just gay”. I had come out to her to try to comfort her because her mother was being mean to her for her being bi. She later told me I should just find a “big black guy with a huge cock” (her words) to fuck me that way my average (she said small) penis wouldn’t matter. She also told me the only people who had tried to be with me were just desperate). Anyways I finally broke up with her and she would then call every few years to apologize and check in on me and talk about her life. During one of these she told me a story about a tinder date who according to her had a really lame pickup game where he asked if she wanted to go get coffee then said he was driving her to a coffee shop but instead drove her to his house and when she asked why he said “well this way we can have cream with our coffee” and winked at her. At that time she laughed about it and said they had had sex but he was really bad at it. I at the time didn’t really like hearing about her life but listened cuz I thought it’d help her. 
A few months later she called and said a man had date raped her, and her mother had said there was nothing they could do because it was her word against his. I advised her to call the cops and get a therapist and did my best to listen.
Here’s where my question comes in: about a year after that she called me to once again apologize for when we were together but this time she said she realizes why she was such a dick: she says her boyfriend she was with before me raped her right before we got together. She said all her cruelty was her acting out and a trauma response to that rape. Keep in mind she had never mentioned anything like that about him, only that he was a loser. During that she also said the coffee guy had raped her, talking about how she had tried to jump from his moving car and how he manhandled her into his house. And she also talked about the other case that she had called me about where she had been date raped.

Here’s the thing: I really don’t buy the two cases she didn’t originally mention. Her accounts are really different than the way she originally told them and she talked about the coffee guy laughingly when she first told me the story. Some might say that was a trauma thing or she was trying to rationalize it, but it feels to me like she is rewriting her life story in her head. Nothing adds up about her having kept these two rapes a secret from me for like three years. There is also the new “realization” that all her cruelty to me was a trauma response which just feels like her trying to find a way to forgive herself.
AITA???? I didn’t tell her I doubted her but I did call bullshit on her bullying being a trauma response. ",1,1732759457.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

We're looking in Brooklyn (looking at Park Slope or Carroll Gardens) but my main concern is that there are so many EPA declared toxic wastelands in this area - all kinds of horrible things and some of them I hadn't even heard of!

We have had issues with mold in our house in Australia, we bought our home quickly during Covid and we've had to spend a lot on remediation work. Is it the same issue with mold in the US? I guess what freaks me out is that a lot of the brownstones and older buildings would definitely have had mold in them at some point?!

","Here is my bull case on $KENDU

Things are looking up and there are signs of better things to come. We have a few daily green candles going and the community sentiment has shifted there are more workers grinding for their bags than there were at ATH's if this doesn't show conviction in a project idk what does.

The sellers will run out of tokens eventually no matter the wallet size it's about preparing for that time so once we start to move more people will know the name and know what we are doing.

* We are leading the space on IRL content including paintings, sticker bombing places, jumping out of planes and shilling to people IRL. We have plans for bigger and better things to do IRL.

* We are leading the space in IRL brand assets we have had community members make stickers, energy drinks, coffee and hot sauce is in development.

[Some of the tasty Kendu IRL brand assets](https://preview.redd.it/8tzogkylsj3e1.png?width=585&format=png&auto=webp&s=5209b96cba89130f60cc8b6a10614c195e8704ee)

The more workers we have the more the general crypto population sees this and the more we are primed so that when we start to gain traction the more people will ape.

Our Dev has doxxed at the bottom when sentiment was the worst showing true conviction in the project and securing the fact he will stay here through the tough times. I don't see any other coins dev doxxing at the bottom or even at all they will just launch a new coin next week if the one they launched last week fails.

Our 90% retracement from ATH has seen so much redistribution and many of the snipers/early investors taking profits and dropping their bag sizes 730B has been sold by wallets which bought before 9 may (aka first time we went above 30m). If we don't include CEX's we have the most decentralised token right now so no one can dump the chart once we start moving. We have seen this in other coins like $GIGA which had 1 wallet destroy the chart from $600m mc to $200m mc in one sell.

[Holders since may 9th referenced in previous paragraph](https://preview.redd.it/r6ioqm85tj3e1.png?width=373&format=png&auto=webp&s=e734ad9b957c2b5dc9fd27a6152609039cdfd0c1)

HODLing can be a difficult game especially when trading with emotion but I have never been more bullish on a coin that's down 90% I think Murad's comment is so good about these times. If the coin survives this (which it has) it has only the real ones left and they are running it up.

This is my bull case, and now is the time to get in. I wait with baited breathe for the replies :).",31,1732758828.0,memecoins,28,1.0,False

It was a foggy, moonless evening in Boston, 1928. The city was a tangled maze of cobbled streets, dim-lit taverns, and smoky jazz clubs. The air smelled of salt from the harbor, mingled with the faint scent of cheap cigars and burnt coffee. But in the back office of *Noir Investigations*, the team of private eyes was hard at work, each one with their own mysterious past, each with their own reason for leaving the past behind.

Johnny Noir, the firm’s founder, sat behind his oak desk, his sharp eyes scanning the thick case file in front of him. A former police officer turned P.I., Johnny had a knack for reading people and situations. His reputation was solid—if you wanted to get the truth, you came to him.

“Got a new case, folks,” Johnny said, his voice gravelly as he tossed the file onto the table. ""A murder.""

“Another one?” Areola Alps, the fiery Spanish ex-freedom fighter, raised an eyebrow. She was always ready for action. In Spain, she'd fought battles for causes far larger than anyone could understand. But now, as a P.I., she was just as dangerous in the streets of Boston as she had been in the hills of Catalonia.

Johnny Asked, “Aren’t you still following up on the three dead Orientals that washed up underneath the Cambridge bridge?”

With a look as sharp as her tongue she shot back, “They're Chinese, not Oriental.....and maybe” her word drifted with her eyes as she turned her gaze away from Johnny forgetting she’s already knee deep in a case.

Johnny, “Stay on that case we’ve already spent the retainer and it’s been 3 days with zip to show for it make sure the newbies know what’s going on and don’t get hurt....also isn’t China in the orient?”

Areola smacks her lips and rolls her eyes at Johnny as she gets up and exits his office gesturing to Colton Reeves, the former bootlegger turned private investigator, lights a cigarette and takes a long drag. A man who knew how to run a racket or two, Colton had his eyes everywhere. Colton in return raps his knuckles on the desk informing the shy plain looking girl with her nose deep in a book that it was time to go. Wilma looked up at Alpie with a quizicall look.

Alpie tells Wilma. “Time to earn our pay Hermanita”

Wilma Fingerdo, the former nun-turned-investigator, gave a quiet sigh as she closed her book and tucked it into her skirt, while making sure her knife was situated.

“Who’s the victim?” asked Joey Bugman, a grizzled ex-special forces operator who’d seen his share of hell and lived to tell about it. At Forty-Five, he looked like he could still break a man’s neck with his bare hands, though these days he preferred solving problems with his mind rather than his fists. “And where did they find them?”

Johnny took a sip from his violently read drink, setting it down before he leaned back in his chair. “A woman. Violet Booker, a dancer at The Crimson Veil club. Found dead in her dressing room last night. No sign of forced entry. No witnesses. The Owner thinks someone’s lying, and I intend to find out who.”

Colton Reeves overhearing the conversation sticks his head in Johnny’s office knocking on the open door with the top of his cane sword and offers his input, “I don’t mean to eavesdrop boss, but Violet Booker. I’ve heard of her,” he said, his voice low and cool. “She was a piece of work. Not many friends in this town, I’d wager.”

Johnny looking from Joey to Colton, “Thanks Colton, you can call me Johnny Pal.”

Colton nods and exits the office in a hurry to catch up to Alpie, and Wilma.

Joey turns from looking out in the hallway to Johnny and says, “No witnesses? i don’t buy it,” he said firmly. “A woman like Violet doesn’t die without someone hearing or seeing something, and what in the four letter word are you drinking? It looks like a commie exploded in your drink.”

“Exactly. That’s why we’re heading to The Crimson Veil. We start there and see where it leads.” Jonny nodded, “and this it’s called a Bloody Mary. It’s French.”

Joey makes a mocking face and tone, “ooooh French huh, why not try a French 75 if you want French, or a Chicago Fizz?”

Johnny shakes his head, “oh no i don’t care if it’s french, i’m just not big on gin, this has Vodka, and you know i don’t like eggs.”

Joey, exasperated, “I keep telling you, you can tell them to hold the egg!”

Johnny puts on his overcoat and hat, “No no, i don’t wanna bother those dames, grab your hat, lets go catch us a goose”. The two walk out of the office killing the lights and locking the door. As the two walk down the hallway and can be heard discussing drink preferences a small letter on johnny’s desk has an unusual symbol that for a moment glows hot red and then sizzles out.

Normal husband parenting

How do your husbands parent? My husband is one of 6 and says I live in a false reality as an only child regarding parenting. 

We have a 25 month old and 8 month old. 

He yells “shut up” to our toddler when he repeats words over and over, is having a tantrum and crying, being whiny. 

He calls him kid when he’s mad at him. For example, if my toddler is using his riding horse to get onto a coffee table, he will yell “come on KID” with disgust in his voice then very firmly rip him off the table and semi-throw the horse behind a gate. 

When my toddler is interested in something that my husband isn’t, like a speck on the ground and is pointing it out to my husband, he will say “I don’t care”

My husband works from home and my son loves to go into all the rooms at home. If my husband is in the bathroom and my son goes in, he will push him out and slam the door in his face. If my husband is getting changed in the bedroom and my sons gets in, he will push him out and slam the door in his face. 

The other night I got so tired of all the negativity in our house that I lost it. I hold up and do the hard work to help my son regulate all day as a SAHM, while doing all the wakeups with my daughter all night, then working on bringing in income after our kids go to sleep. Within 5 minutes of my husband watching the kids there is always yelling or negativity and it gives me anxiety. Majorly. I cannot imagine how my son’s nervous system must feel. 

The very first time he yelled shut up to our son was when he was a few months old and crying and wouldn’t sleep. He told me he wouldn’t remember and he would be better by the time he would remember. I fear he hasn’t changed. 

Please tell me how your husbands parent and discipline. He says he will not be a second mother to our children, but I don’t find this being a father. I find it being authoritarian.

1h1kmjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1h1kmjf/review_honeymoon_at_hotel_esencia_xpuha_mx/,"Review - Honeymoon at Hotel Esencia (Xpu-Ha, MX)","Hello! Long time listener, first time caller -- very happy to attempt to contribute to this community after learning so much from you all.

We had our recent honeymoon at Hotel Esencia (Oct. 28 through Nov. 3) -- and, even though we'd been looking forward to this trip for over a year, it was nothing short of perfect and exceeded our expectations in every way. Easily the best trip we have ever taken, and will be extremely difficult to surpass.

This will be a bit of an odd review, because I am first going to share/defer to a [professional's review](https://hotelsabovepar.com/hotel-esencia-quintana-roo-mexico-hotel-review/) that I read just a few days after we got back, and felt that it really captured the main experience of Hotel Esencia very, very well. Most readers can basically stop reading here, because, well, that review likely covers everything you'd want to know (and, in my opinion, with 100% accuracy).

However, I'll continue prattling on to add a couple thoughts that were unique to *our* experience. You see, we are aspiring 'chubby' travelers, rather than true chubby or fat travelers. 'Ballin on a budget', you might say. That said, we decided to take a really special trip for our honeymoon, understanding that we'd spend more than we normally would. Somehow, we landed an **unbelievable** deal for Hotel Esencia - I actually did not realize quite how good a deal it was until we were there. The 'stay more, save more' offer allowed us to stay in a Jungle Suite (with private/indoor warm plunge pool upgrade..!!) for 6 nights at an average rate of $700 per night. This rate even included a daily food+bev credit of $100/day! For reference, the usual minimum room rate starts at $1,200/night. So, by sheer luck, we were able to book this stay at Hotel Esencia without exceeding our budget.

Esencia is really paradise on earth. We felt more relaxed there than we could have ever imagined. The entire property is designed (inspired by? optimized for?) for wellness, but not in the way that feels like you're being bashed over the head with  \~ wellness \~. Hard to explain! We also nearly had the entire place to ourselves for about 4 of our 6 days there (more guests arrived closer to the weekend, and it was also really nice to have them there for a livelier feel). All the food was absolutely delicious, of course. Every detail was so thoughtful - we were greeted with a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and treated to said suite upgrade, just because it was our honeymoon. Within a couple hours of arriving, we were invited to snorkel with manatees in the lagoon next door (do NOT miss this under any circumstances - I will never forget this experience for as long as I live). Our first dessert had 'happy honeymoon' beautifully written on the plate (aw!). The little gifts placed on our pillows each night! The Dia de Muertos celebrations hosted by HE were magical beyond words - in no way did they feel chintzy or artificially put on para los gringos (even though....they were in fact para los gringos). It felt like the entire staff truly went above and beyond to make every moment of our honeymoon so special and memorable. Every single person was so warm and kind to us. I am such a loser that I am nearly crying just thinking about it.

Without detracting from *any* of the above, Esencia is decidedly not designed for, uh, ballin' on a budget. I sincerely doubt that there was a single other guest on that property who even noticed how much anything cost. HE is meant for guests to whom money is absolutely no object. For instance, the most affordable cocktail/mixed drink available on the property is $26 USD. The 3 hour excursion offered by your concierge to the local ruins and one cenote will run you $400 per person. Spa treatments were totally out of the question for us, unfortunately. The $100 daily credit will cover a modest lunch *or* dinner for two, no drinks. To be clear, I do not mean this as a negative \[or positive\] aspect of Esencia -- it simply just is. I also fully realize that these prices are likely **totally fine**, par for the course, for the vast majority of chubby travelers (please do not throw me out of the group!).

With a little creativity, we were actually able to make this work, without even having to dip into the retirement accounts (yay!). The complimentary pastries and coffee every morning = our breakfast. The complimentary tea, cookies, and petit fours each afternoon = snack. We opted for Happy Shuttle for our airport transfer ($150 total for two people, round trip), as opposed to HE's offered Escalade airport transfer for $250/pp each way (= $1000 total). Was it glamorous? No. Did we get there comfortably, with kind and prompt service, in the same amount of time? Yes. Instead of booking tours/excursions through the hotel, we fired up good ol' Viator, and spent about $150 for each of two really fun, enjoyable days off-site, with small groups of other tourists. The sea turtle snorkeling experience in Akumal with Ocean Tours was phenomenal (hope my wedding band is enjoying itself in the Gulf of Mexico, though - RIP, we hardly knew ye). One of our favorite parts of our trip was going to the steam room, infrared sauna, hot tub/mineral soak, and ice mineral soak at the spa, especially late at night - we had the entire place to ourselves. Treatments will cost ya \[A LOT\], but all of the above parts of the spa are complimentary (and of the very highest quality and design, naturally). It's also super easy/affordable to get around the area - we took a private cab to Playa del Carmen for approx. $30 each way. In any event, this is all to say that it is very possible to experience Hotel Esencia without totally breaking the bank, just with a little planning to do things a bit differently.

A few other assorted considerations/thoughts, in no particular order:

\- While there were a few children at HE during our stay (who seemed reasonably content), I would absolutely not bring children here myself. It is so hard to explain, but it is just not ...designed for kids.

\- So, so, so quiet. This was a major positive for us! We slept SO well. However, if nightlife is a must, you will not be particularly exhilarated by HE (at least, not at this time of year).

\- Animals! There are a ton of super-cute, exotic animals on the property (agouti, iguanas, coatimundi, manatees, sea turtles). We loved this aspect so much.

\- Beach: ridiculously gorgeous, soft white sand, very warm water, very gentle waves. We didn't see any sargassum! HE provides lovely, comfortable cabanas for guest lounging, with attendant servers. However, if you are looking for exciting surf/big crashing waves, you will not find it here.

\- Can't really get anywhere on foot from HE. No surrounding town in the immediate area.

I've gotten on tadalafil and (IMO, more importantly) have improved my mindset around this tremendously. I'm not 100% better and still get some urethral irritation and sensitivity throughout the day.

I'm tempted to try to ignore it and just see if it gets better on its own, but my urologist has encouraged me to try an IC-style diet to see if it will have any impact.

I'm actually rather worried about this. I have a strong sense that mentality plays a big role in my symptoms, and, frankly, coffee + spicy food play a huge role in my daily routine. I'm willing to try this, but I'm also scared of reinforcing the feeling of being a slave to the condition and accidentally re-worsening my condition.

I've read the 101 and seen that only a minority of cases are sensitive to diet. On the other hand, because my symptoms are mainly in the urinary tract, it feels reasonable to give it a shot. I guess to help me get in a better headspace - how long does it usually take dietary changes to have an effect (or not)? Is there a consistent time window for this, or is it different for everyone and we're all just figuring it out as I go?",3,1732757346.0,Prostatitis,0,1.0,False

I am very healthy, quite fit. But over the year the food noise, sugar craving has gone off the charts. I am reaching my late 30s, have hypothyroidism and all those fun things. But I exercise, and wear S size clothing. I wore a continuous glucose monitor and compared to my partner, my food spikes for basically any food (oatmeal, coffee, etc.) does huge spikes and huge drops (Literally shoots up to the diabetes warning level, but I am not diabetic). Anyways, I gained 5lbs and I had a super hard time losing it because I hate dieting, and the second I think about losing weight, I tie up all my mood and energy on my weight. This affects my relationship. Not very healthy.

Where I live, I can get a GLP-1 Sax Enda with no prescription, except I need to be in a normal range BMI and I pay out of pocket. The dosage says I am to increase from 0.6 to 0.9 to 1.2, etc. per week. But I have noticed even with the 0.6 minimum dosage, the food noise goes way down. The first week I was a bit nauseous and ate less than normal, but afterwards I have stabilized and ate the same meals as before. I still get hungry, eat candy, have a drink. But instead of needing a candy, then another candy, then 2 drinks. I just eat / drink one and my sugar craving is quiet. I also picked up jogging again, and in the past, after running I am ravenous and shoving food down me. But I have basically just eaten the same amount with not much additional hunger cues. I also noticed that before GLP-1 , I would eat dinner quickly, but it would take about 30 mins for my stomach to cue my brain I was full. But now, it only takes about 10-15 mins for my brain to register I am full.

So in the 4 weeks of minimum dosage, I have dropped the 5lbs I wanted to drop. I really do not need to lose more weight. I think I will keep taking it until after Christmas holidays and then stop. The meds out of pocket are not cheap, but I am so happy that I am not always thinking about my weight, my food, etc. My relationship with eating food is so much healthier. Definitely worth it for me!

","**Triple Chocolate Cake** 🍫🎂

Are you ready to dive into chocolate heaven? This **Triple Chocolate Cake** is the ultimate treat for all chocoholics. With layers of moist chocolate cake and rich chocolate buttercream, it’s a dessert you’ll make over and over again! Here’s how to create this chocolate masterpiece:

# Ingredients

# For the Cake

* 1¾ cups (219g) all-purpose flour
* ¾ cup (62g) unsweetened cocoa powder (natural, not Dutch-processed)
* 1¾ cups (350g) granulated sugar
* 2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons espresso powder (optional, but boosts chocolate flavor!)
* ½ cup (120ml) vegetable oil (or canola or melted coconut oil)
* 2 large eggs, at room temperature
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* 1 cup (240ml) buttermilk, at room temperature
* 1 cup (240ml) freshly brewed strong hot coffee (regular or decaf)

# For the Chocolate Buttercream

* 1¼ cups (282g) unsalted butter, softened
* 3½ cups (420g) powdered sugar
* ¾ cup (65g) unsweetened cocoa powder (natural or Dutch-processed)
* 3–5 tablespoons (45–75ml) heavy cream, at room temperature
* ¼ teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* Optional: semi-sweet chocolate chips for garnish

# Instructions

# Step 1: Prep the Pans

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C).
2. Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper, and grease the parchment. This ensures the cakes release easily.

# Step 2: Make the Cake Batter

1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using).
2. In another bowl, mix oil, eggs, and vanilla until smooth. Stir in buttermilk until combined.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until combined. Slowly add hot coffee and mix until smooth. The batter will be thin—that’s normal!

# Step 3: Bake the Cakes

1. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans.
2. Bake for 23–26 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
3. Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

# Step 4: Make the Buttercream

1. Beat softened butter with a mixer on medium speed until creamy (about 2 minutes).
2. Add powdered sugar, cocoa powder, 3 tablespoons of heavy cream, salt, and vanilla. Mix on low speed until combined, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 minute. Adjust the consistency with more powdered sugar (if too thin) or cream (if too thick).

# Step 5: Assemble the Cake

1. If the cakes have domed tops, level them with a serrated knife for even layers.
2. Place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand. Spread a thick layer of buttercream on top.
3. Add the second cake layer and frost the top and sides evenly. Use an offset spatula for a smooth finish.
4. Garnish with chocolate chips or shavings if desired.

# Step 6: Chill and Serve

1. Refrigerate the cake uncovered for 30–60 minutes to set the frosting.
2. Slice and enjoy at room temperature or chilled.

# Storage Tips

* Cover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
* Freeze frosted cake or individual slices for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge and serve.

This **Triple Chocolate Cake** is a showstopper that’s as indulgent as it is beautiful. Perfect for birthdays, celebrations, or whenever you need a little chocolate therapy.

Reddit has been particularly hard for ranges, as there is so much negative experience with literally every brand I've looked at, which makes sense - people tend to post negative experiences and not positive ones.

Ready to bake a show-stopping holiday treat? These **Linzer Trees** combine the rich nuttiness of almond flour with a sweet raspberry jam filling, dusted with a delicate layer of powdered sugar. Perfect for your cookie swaps or holiday dessert tables, these cookies are bound to be the star of the season.

# Ingredients

* **13 tablespoons salted butter**
* **3/4 cup + 3 tablespoons Bob’s Red Mill Super-Fine Almond Flour**
* **1 1/3 cups Bob’s Red Mill Unbleached White All-Purpose Flour**
* **1/4 teaspoon baking powder**
* **1/4 teaspoon kosher salt**
* **1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg**
* **1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon**
* **1/2 cup granulated sugar**
* **1 tablespoon light brown sugar**
* **1 large egg (room temperature)**
* **1 teaspoon vanilla extract**
* **1/4 teaspoon almond extract**
* **Confectioners’ sugar (for dusting)**
* **1/2 cup raspberry jam (for filling)**

# Instructions

# Step 1: Brown the Butter

In a medium pot over medium heat, melt the butter. Whisk often as it foams and then browns, about 5 to 7 minutes. Once golden and fragrant, pour the butter into a liquid measuring cup to cool slightly (around 5 minutes).

# Step 2: Make the Dough

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine almond flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, granulated sugar, and brown sugar.

With the mixer on low, slowly drizzle in the browned butter. Add the egg, vanilla, and almond extracts, mixing just until a dough forms.

# Step 3: Chill the Dough

Shape the dough into a disc, wrap it in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours until firm.

# Step 4: Roll & Cut the Cookies

Preheat your oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.

Place the chilled dough between two pieces of parchment paper and roll it out to about 1/4-inch thickness. Peel off the top parchment and use a tree-shaped cookie cutter to cut out cookies. Re-roll the scraps to cut more shapes.

For half of the trees, use a floured pastry tip (or small cutter) to create 3–4 tiny cutouts for the ""window."" Arrange the cookies on the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1/2 inch between each.

For best results, freeze the cut cookies for about 20 minutes before baking to maintain their shape.

# Step 5: Bake the Cookies

Transfer the chilled cookies to the oven and bake for 14–15 minutes, or until the edges are just starting to turn golden. Let the cookies cool completely on the baking sheet before assembling.

# Step 6: Assemble the Linzer Trees

Dust the tops of the cookies with the cutouts with powdered sugar. Spread about 2 teaspoons of raspberry jam on each solid tree base. Gently place the powdered sugar-dusted cookies on top to create the sandwich.

# Serve and Enjoy!

These **Linzer Trees** are elegant, delicious, and bursting with holiday cheer. Perfect with a cup of tea, coffee, or even a glass of milk!

I'm 23, live in england and have been waiting 2 months for a consultation with a neurologist, with not much info from my local clinic doctors. I've been diagnosed with a brain avm after doing 2 mris, but I feel like my symptons don't match the condition. Don't really know where else to do much research about this, so I thought I might try here.

For starters I'm not denying the avm, I trust the doctors, it's just that what triggered my headaches was a singular event, and I don't have any point of reference to know if it's normal. (I've read that some avms might not give any symptons at all, and I've always been very physically active, gym 3-5 days a week for years, so I suspect my condition might be something else).  
  
It started around 5 or 6 months ago. At the time I was a regular smoker, trying to quit, working 2 jobs and drinking 2-3 coffees a day, and in the middle of a problematic moving in situation with my partner. The pressure really got to me and I had a panic attack (no pain, just incredible sudden light headness and all my worries kind of went away) got a cab to the hospital and by the time I got there it had gone away, so the doctor told me it was a panic attack  


Still kept going with both jobs, pressures mounting up, and a month later, after drinking a lot of coffee and having a disagreement with a co-worker, I had another, this time accompanied by severe pain on a straight line from the back-bottom of my head (around the top of my spine) to the top of my skull (that being the reason why I suspect it might be a spinal fluid leak). Lasted an hour, thought I was going to die to be honest, never felt pain like that. it was a saturday and there were no doctors in my local emergency hospital, so I manage to go to bed after.

that reoccured 4 times within a period of 3 weeks. After the second time I started feeling a pressure on the top of my skull almost constantly, everyday, though the pressure moves at times.

Finally went to the emergency doctor, she told my I was dehydrated lol. And the thing is, ever since I started drinking more water, the ""thunderclap"" headaches have completely stopped thank god.   
  
But for the last 5 months I've had the consistent feeling of  liquid pressure on top of my skull, and liquid movement on my head every now and then. This can also make me dizzy at times, or the pressure can move. It also makes my ears pop a lot at times, especially at work, a couple times so much so that I physically couldn't pop my ears anymore, as if there was something blocking them. Also, at times the skin above the affected area feels tender, as if it was bruised.  
  
Funny enough, I barely feel it at work when I'm moving, or when I'm doing things that would raise my blood pressure like sex. But it becomes noticeable after I sit down or don't move much for a while (which has been making my sleep schedule pretty bad).

Hot bathtubs really help, it makes the pressure I feel on top of my head kind of melt (?) and I feel the liquid finally making it's way to to the rest of my head, though I swear I've felt this liquid come out of my left ear in the hot bath at times (I could be wrong and it might just be water, but it feels slightly thicker, I don't know if I'm going crazy). It does always builds up again after a while though.

thank you for reading this

Monday was our 3rd date and our first time when alcohol was available. 

So, my BFF is a local standup comedian and I show my support by attending her shows. I invited a Bumble date to join me…we had previously met for Sunday brunch and again for coffee. Both pleasant encounters. He picked me up and I’m a lifelong faster so I hadn’t eaten yet that day. He was aware of that and when we arrived at the venue he ordered 3 Greek appetizers that sounded plentiful. A bourbon for him and white wine for me. Food took forever so I ordered another vino (and water). The food arrives and it’s slight…like basically 3 small Greek salads. I use the restroom during the intro to hit my vape pen and return to Bumble date to find a fresh glass of wine. Great! The show is 2+hours (multiple comedians) so I ordered another glass of wine (and water). My date was driving and only had that one bourbon.

By the time the show ended I was so drunk! Social skills are my super power so I’m pretty sure I didn’t do/say anything too obnoxious. But who knows! Ugh! My date was such a gentleman, respectful in every way. But I haven’t heard from him since his Monday evening “I got home safely,” text. 

I’m interested in seeing him again. Should I preemptively apologize for getting hammered on our date? Haha! Call or text? I’m afraid I may have scared him off! What’s your feedback?

1h1jz38,https://i.redd.it/3o56hkwpjj3e1.jpeg,Holiday recipes I promised,"Since I'm in the middle of cooking stuff for Thanksgiving, I'll share some of my favorites.

Sorry I can't take pictures of what I am cooking, I'm doing part of the cooking today and finishing up the rest tomorrow since we got 10 people coming over. 

For sugar substitute when cooking I use 1 tsp stevia powder + 1 cup allulose.

I don't use erythritol since when it cools it will become crunchy.

For light brown sugar use 1 cup sugar replacement + 2 to 3 tsp molasses. 

For dark brown sugar use 1 cup sugar replacement + 4 to 6 tsp molasses.

After you measure out your granular sugar replacement, I turn it into confectionery so it blends easier with a coffee grinder.

**Pumpkin pie**

I follow the can recipe and use a from scratch pie shell, there are tons online, this is my go-to one:

https://thebigmansworld.com/keto-pie-crust/

Swap out sugar for allulose + stevia blend and a little molasses, milk for a mix of heavy cream and almond milk.

That's an easy one.

**Cranberries**

Follow instructions on bag but swap out sugar for allulose + stevia blend.

**Stuffing**

I use this recipe: 

https://www.fourscoreliving.com/low-carb-stuffing/

Since I usually don't have all of those seasonings, I substitute Italian seasoning for the rosemary and sage and all of that. 

**Salad or super croutons**

Use the same recipe above but instead: 

Add the thyme and rosemary and sage into the batter, if you don't have those individual seasoning, I use Italian seasoning.

Cut it into square size of choice after baking

Return them to the oven and bake more and remember to flip them over until you get a crushed consistency that you like. 

**Ginger cookies**

I make my ginger cookies almost medicinal grade like Jamaican ginger soda heavy duty so be warned it will be almost medicinal. 

I use this recipe: 

I will double the amount of ginger and will even add fresh grated ginger. 

If you don't want to make gingerbread cookies and just want to make ginger cookies, I roll It fairly thin and then use a tuna can that I cut both sides off to cut out my cookies.

I have also made this recipe but will add grated pureed ginger.

**Pound cake**

I modified this recipe to give it a little bit of a fruit flavor: 

https://thebigmansworld.com/keto-pound-cake/

I use oikos mixed berry yogurt and add a bit of strawberry extract. 

**Green bean casserole**

I use this recipe: 

https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/keto-green-bean-casserole/

I add some green onions just a tad bit of soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce, not too much.

**Turkey gravy**

This is basically the recipe that I've been using but the person who made this recipe adds xanthan gum and I use it now. 

I use turkey broth from the turkey 

**Sugar cookies**

This is the go-to recipe I get the best results from:

1h1jxx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeePH/comments/1h1jxx0/uhoh_coffee_prices_are_going_up/,"Uh-oh, Coffee Prices Are Going Up","I just saw the news, and it looks like coffee prices are spiking due to climate issues in Brazil and Vietnam, especially in the former.

	“A severe drought earlier this year in Brazil, the world’s biggest coffee grower, greatly affected crop output. Vietnam, another major producer, faced its own challenges: dry conditions during the growing season followed by too much rain at harvest time.”

I’m worried cafes will hike prices, and roasters will probably follow suit.

I really hope coffees from Indonesia, Ethiopia, and other producers won’t see the same price increases. But my favorites are from Brazil and Vietnam 😭",14,1732755394.0,CoffeePH,8,0.94,False
