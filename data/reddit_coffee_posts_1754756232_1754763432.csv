# THE FINAL PUPIL

***GAME INFORMATION***

***THE SETTING:*** For whatever reason, your character is interested in new work—whether they were recently laid off, just starting out, or are looking to transition into a new field, they inevitably stumble upon the job posting above and find it intriguing enough to apply within. If clever enough, the decoded cipher will provide your character with an email which they may provide their application materials.  
  
The game is set in modern day London. The world you exist in is split between common normalcy separated by a supernatural veil which harbors an otherwise hidden world ruled by fringe science and cosmic phenomena. In the ""normal"" world, fantastical criminal networks, super-villains, and the heroes and geniuses which attempt to keep them in check, rule over a crumbling society; behind the veil, a wavering line of psychic impossibility, unexplained events, and mysterious creatures threaten to tow the line between ""*hidden""* and ""*here"".*

* Similar Sources: *Sherlock BBC, The Platform, Hannibal, Squid Games, The Genius, X-Files, Psychic High, Inscryption*
* [***The Final Pupil Pinterest Board***](https://pin.it/7qhyu4Kr5)

***YOUR CHARACTER:*** Incredibly skilled, intelligent, desperate, has little to loose.  
  
***YOU ARE...:***

* Someone who is interested in a high-stakes, emotional game including violent themes and explicit content.
* Someone who is willing to delve deeply into their character creation and psyche.
* Someone who is interested in forming a community and friend group outside of in-character interactions.
* Someone who is an experienced writer, willing to match post length and quality, and post at least once daily (*previous MOTW experience not required*).
* Someone who thinks that out of character connections are just as important as in character connections.
* You are over 18 years old, preferably over 21.
* An ally or member of the LGBT+ community.

***THE DM/THE PLAYERS:*** My name is Lo! I am a DM (30, he/him) who has been playing TTRPG's for a little under a decade and writing for roughly two. This game is entirely home-brewed and, as it features my most favorite original character, is very dear to my heart. I am a lover of prose, and a hobby novelist who enjoys writing mostly dark themes or things that could be considered cosmic horror or psychological thrillers.   
As a Graduate student with a full-time job, my normal every-day-life is very busy, and I carve out particular times during the week and weekend to dedicate toward writing and my games because it is truly my favorite way to interact socially. I love yapping about characters and plot theory with fellow players, sending memes or just hanging out in voice chat. I would hope that anyone who applies to this game would enjoy those things as well!  
  
There are already two players who have entered the game, both of which are experienced in writing and TTRPG's and share similar sentiments surrounding character creation and out of character involvement.

Hey folks,

First off, huge thanks to this sub and everyone here who pitched in when I first shared this idea a few months ago. The advice, intros, and random brainstorming sessions with some of you really helped me figure things out.

I’m AK — you might remember my “looking for a co-founder” post about three months back. Fast forward and we’re now ready to launch Make it Real.

We’re building a webapp for it, but that’ll take a bit more time. Why wait? We’re kicking things off right now.

What’s Make it Real?

Think of it as a third space in Bangalore where you can meet new people, hang out, and do cool stuff — without the pressure of swiping, networking, or having to always be the best version of yourself.

	•	No cameras, no phones during events
	•	Curated groups so you actually talk to people
	•	Stuff you’ll remember because you were present, and not in your phone. 
	•	Fun, random, budget-friendly experiences


Here’s just some of our experiences coming up in month one:

	•	Make your own Ganapati workshop
	•	Paint and brunch
	•	Exclusive jam session
	•	Food walk and restaurant takeover
	•	Arcade night
	•	Heritage walk
	•	Curated matcha and coffee experience
	•	Exclusive improv session
      •	Murder Mystery 
      •	Board games 

Pricing:

We are charging a one-time ₹300 access fee, which you can redeem against your first event. 

After that, you just pay for the events you attend.  Keeping it transparent and budget-friendly is our goal here.

Who’s behind this?

We’re 7–8 people from Bangalore Newbies, a community I started in Oct 2023. We’ve done 400–500 events so far, so we know how to make it easier for strangers to become friends.

If you’re in Bangalore and want in, DM me. We keep events small so spots will go fast.

TL;DR: Make it Real is live — a no-camera, no-phone, safe space for making friends and doing fun stuff in Bangalore. ₹300 one-time fee (redeemable), event costs extra. Webapp coming soon but we’re starting now. First month includes Ganapati making, paint & brunch, jam sessions, food walks, heritage walk, matcha & coffee, and improv. DM to join.

1mlw1gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mlw1gf/experience_the_best_singleserve_coffee_maker/,Experience the Best Single-Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K1500 Review,"The Keurig K1500 has been a regular presence in my kitchen for the past month, and I can say, with my hand on my coffee cup, that it’s been quite an experience. This single-serve coffee machine is marketed toward small businesses with teams of around 15 people, but I tested it to see how well it performs in a busy household. With a promising reputation for convenience, quiet operation, and excellent coffee quality, I was curious to see if it lives up to the buzz. From the sleek design to its efficiency, there’s a lot this brewer gets right, but no product is without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Right off the bat, the Keurig K1500 is visually appealing. Its black body paired with clean lines seamlessly fits into just about any countertop setting, whether it’s a cozy kitchen at home or a modern office pantry. For someone like me, who has limited counter space, its dimensions of 12.4x10.3x12.1 inches were neither overly bulky nor too small. It exudes sturdiness, too, with the buttons feeling solid and responsive. One thing I appreciated is that this machine isn’t covered in high-gloss plastic that collects fingerprints. Even after daily use, it looks as polished as the day I unboxed it.

**Brew Customization Options and Performance**  
What really impressed me was the Keurig K1500’s usability. There are four different brew size options: 6, 8, 10, and 12 ounces. This feature has been a lifesaver during mornings when I want just a quick shot of caffeine and evenings when I prefer a more leisurely cup. I was particularly keen on testing the STRONG button, which Keurig claims delivers a bolder, more intense flavor. As someone who loves punchy coffee, I can confirm it does the job quite well. This feature doesn’t just make your coffee “stronger”—it subtly adjusts the brewing to enhance the flavor without over-extracting it and turning it bitter.

**Key Benefits**  
- Four brew sizes accommodate varying coffee preferences.  
- STRONG button creates a richer, bolder coffee experience.  
- Exceptional build quality ensures a long-lasting product.  

[Check Keurig K1500 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b07m67x3gn/)

**Water Reservoir and Maintenance Simplicity**  
Can I take a moment to rave about the water reservoir? I’ve owned coffee machines with small tanks before, and the constant refilling was exhausting. The K1500’s 96-ounce reservoir is a game changer. Its easy-to-use handle simplifies cleaning and refilling, and I only need to fill it a couple of times a week. It’s especially ideal for large households or shared spaces. Maintenance, too, is straightforward. A few wipes and a rinse of the reusable filter mechanism, and it’s good to go. Considering I’m not a fan of high-maintenance appliances (who has time for that?), this aspect was much appreciated.

**Noise Control and Operation**  
Early risers like me know the pain of waking others with noisy appliances. To my pleasant surprise, Quiet Brew Technology actually lives up to its promise. It's almost surreal to brew coffee in a silent kitchen without the rattling and whirring I've grown accustomed to with other machines. While it’s not whisper-quiet, it’s leagues ahead of older Keurig models. My kids didn’t even notice me brewing coffee during chaotic school mornings.

**Downsides**  
- The K-Cup pods aren’t eco-friendly without purchasing separate reusable ones.  
- STRONG button adds brewing time, but the flavor is worth the wait.

**Competing Products**  
When comparing the Keurig K1500 with a heavy hitter like the Nespresso VertuoPlus, there are several notable differences. While the Nespresso system is renowned for its espresso capabilities and creamy coffee layering, the K1500 offers more convenience for day-to-day brewing versatility and larger cup sizes. Another competitor, the Cuisinart SS-10P1, gives the K1500 a run for its money with its built-in hot water dispenser and a self-cleaning feature. However, the quiet operation and robust design of the K1500 leave it unmatched for larger households or office setups. Both alternatives have their own merits, but the K1500 edges out for those seeking versatility in brewing sizes and minimal maintenance.

**Quality for Price**  
The price point for the Keurig K1500 reflects its capabilities—it’s a mid-tier investment for exceptional convenience. Having tested it for efficiency, customization options, and ease of cleaning, I’d say the coffee maker justifies its cost. Would you find cheaper machines on the market? Absolutely. But when factoring in the 96-ounce tank, STRONG brewing button, and robust design, this brewer offers excellent value for the tech-savvy coffee lover.

Big fan of storytelling in all its forms. Books might be your competition, but while I'm not a gamer myself, I’m also into games with strong narratives, shows that take over your brain, and convos that bounce between deep and nonsense. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure book. A clue, it's a genre I don't normally read, but the Before trilogy of films is one of the greatest representations on the genre on screen. Now, what genre am I talking about? Have a guilty pleasure of your own for us to smile about?



I keep telling myself I’ll revisit my love of history, but the band Sabaton’s currently carrying the torch. Seeing them live soon. If metal meets war history sounds uniquely fun to you, we’ll probably get along. What shall we sing along to?



I’ve somehow become a runner. It started impulsively with a decision to run a marathon even though I haven't run since school. I've grown to love the meditative rhythm of a good run, and yes, the occasional smug Strava post might appear. Not to mention the obligatory coffee and pint rewards after a run. Gotta survive somehow.



I love getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, the everyday bits in between. I’m here for a dynamic which feels like something we both wanna invest in. I’d love to meet someone who’s emotionally grounded, curious, and wants to work on building something.



So, what’s your thing? What’s the topic you could talk about for hours? What are you currently obsessed with? Teach me something. Recommend a show, a song, a book, or a random interest. Bonus points if your answer makes me want to see you tell the story in person or jump on a call.

I’m from Germany but stay in Seattle and will maybe end up living here. 
I would like to meet up with people. I'm weird, like psychology and I'm up for so many different things. I like being vulnerable and I do not like judging people. I try to be as open minded as possible and see so much beauty in this world. We can go dumpster diving or go to a park and just lie down. We can also talk on the phone and talk about all the things that bother us in this world. The current state of the world sure bothers me. I find it hard to connect. I don't think I'm picky, I'm just complicated yet simple - an oxymoron, perhaps? I'm not perfect, so I don't expect you to be perfect. I think that sounds pretty fair. I like coffee, cycling, enjoying the little things, being spontaneous, going to parks, playing some games here and there, movies/tv shows, books, exploring different things. I like so much. I also love people and how different we all are. I know I want to find friends for seattle and I desperately want to connect since I find it hard to do.
I like doing boring things as well. I’m a bit socially awkward with extroversion and sarcasm sprinkled in lol


I'm so willing to understand everything and think we have so much to offer. Whatever you want to do, try me. My humor is dry and dark but can be awkward and silly as well. I will admit that I'm introverted but I can be extroverted as well. I'm constantly trying to grow and be better. I want to treat people good and be good to myself as well.

I also like roasted salted peanut butter.

The room is dim, except for the flicker of the heart monitor’s green line and the faint rattle of a cart being wheeled past outside. Two hospital beds, one privacy curtain. On the left: Anni, still pale, hair matted with sweat, staring at the congealed hospital scrambled eggs on her tray. On the right: Tom the Pioneer, pushing his own tray around like the eggs might form a more palatable shape if he stares long enough.**

 

**Tom dryly, through the curtain:** “Not gourmet, huh?”

 

**Anni snorts softly:** “I think this hash brown just winked at me.”

 

**Tom**: “Eat it quick before it tries to walk off.”

 

**They both chuckle… slow, tired, postictal laughter. The kind that still aches a little in the chest.**

 

**Footsteps. The curtain shivers as Alice enters Anni’s side of the room, her voice sharp.**

 

**Alice**: “Do you have any idea how embarrassing that was? In the middle of the store, Anni. You scared people. You *scared me*. This has to stop!”

 

**Anni’s voice grows small:** “I can’t just… stop.”

 

**Alice**: “You don’t even *try*.”

 

**Tom’s hand freezes halfway to his juice cup. He glances toward the curtain, brows pulling together. There’s an old, familiar** ***sting*** **in Alice’s tone. One he’s heard before, from people who think fear equals authority.**

 

**Alice**: “You know what? I’m calling Dr. Trenton myself. Maybe if you were in a proper program so wouldn’t end up here every other week!”

 

**Tom quietly reaches over and presses the NURSE CALL button.**

 

**Tom as quiet as he can:** “Hey, uh, nurse? Can we get some help over here?”

 

**He means for Anni. To interrupt. To make her feel less alone. Instead a younger Nurse Nefarious enters the room. Uniform crisp, clipboard at the ready.**

 

**Nurse Nefarious**: “What’s the issue?”

 

**Alice answers immediately:** “She’s not safe to go home. She gets violent. She nearly burned my house down last month.”

 

**Anni protests:** “That was a seizure. I was cooking—”

 

**Alice cuts her off:** “She’s dangerous. She needs psych.”

 

**Tom leans forward, parting the curtain just enough.**

 

**Tom**: “That’s not what happened—”

 

**But Nurse Nefarious has already started scribbling. She looks at Tom like he’s a well-meaning but confused old man. Then to Alice. She speak with the tone of someone rewarding the “responsible” sibling.**

 

**Nurse Nefarious**: “We’ll notify Psych to do an evaluation.”

 

**The door closes behind her. Tom sits up in his bed, IV in his arm, hospital gown rumpled. His eyes are sharp even though his body’s still tired from the seizure. Across from him, in the curtained-off space, is the muffled sound of Alice’s voice talking to Anni.**

 

**The curtain swishes open.**

 

**Alice**: “Oh, *you’re* the other patient. You were here when my sister had her… episode.”

 

**Tom**: “You mean she went into status epilepticus?”

 

**Alice tilts her head, her voice is too sweet:** “Well, *if* that’s what it was. You know, a lot of people mistake stress reactions for seizures. The mind is a very powerful thing.”

 

**Tom doesn’t even blink. He’s heard this kind of soft-gaslight before. Polite words that gut someone’s reality.**

 

**Tom**: “I’ve had epilepsy for fifty years. I know a seizure when I see one.”

 

**Alice smiles wider:** “Well, you’ve got your experience, and I’ve got mine. I’ve lived with her since she was born. And I *know* when she’s just looking for attention.”

 

**Tom leans forward, voice steady.**

 

**Tom**: “Lady, if she wanted attention, she’d probably pick something more fun than face-planting into the stove.”

 

**Alice bristles but keeps the sugary tone.**

 

**Alice**: “You seem like a nice man. But you’re wrong about her. You don’t see what I see.”

 

**Tom**, quiet and deliberate: “I see enough. And I don’t doubt for a second what’s real for her.”

 

**Alice shrugs like she’s humoring a child:** “Suit yourself.” 

 

**She disappears back behind the curtain. Tom leans back, frowning toward the thin fabric. He can hear Anni’s voice now. She is tired, defensive, trying to explain herself to a brick wall. That’s when Tom makes the decision. When discharge comes, he’ll wait for her. Because some people need a witness to say ‘I believe you’.**

 

**Anni turns to Tom, as transport comes to wheel her away:** “Guess it’s my turn to disappear.”

 

**Tom, his voice quiet, pained:** “I’m sorry, kid.”

 

**The door swings shut behind them. Tom sits back in his bed, the eggs staring up at him mockingly. He doesn’t eat them.**

 

**Psych Evaluation Room**

 

**The room is too white, too bright, with a desk that’s far too clean for a place where people pour their lives out. A large clock ticks loud enough to be annoying. Anni sits in the plastic chair, legs crossed, her discharge bag by her feet. She’s pale, tired, still in hospital scrubs. Across from her is Dr. Lowell, mid-40s, holding a clipboard and wearing the professional smile of someone who’s done this too many times.**

 

**Dr. Lowell**: “Okay, Anni, we’re just going to go over a few standard questions before we determine if you’re ready for discharge.”

 

**Anni**: “Sure. Let’s get this over with.”

 

**Dr. Lowell, reading from the sheet:** “Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself?”

 

**Anni, tone flat:** “No.”

 

**Dr. Lowell**: “Any thoughts about harming others?”

 

**Anni**: “No.”

 

**Anni mutters under her breath:** “Not even my sister.”

 

**Dr. Lowell, looking up:** “Pardon?”

 

**Anni smiles sweetly:** “I said, ‘Not even my sister.’”

 

**Dr. Lowell**: “…Right. And have you been experiencing any hallucinations or hearing voices?”

 

**Anni**: “Unless you count the nurse telling me my seizure was ‘just stress.’ In that case, yes.”

 

**Dr. Lowell** scribbles down notes, ignoring her sarcasm: “Do you feel safe in your current living situation?”

 

**Anni** gives a sharp laugh: “Safe enough. I only have to dodge the emotional landmines.”

 

**Dr. Lowell** hesitates: “And… do you feel like you’re a danger to yourself or anyone else?”

 

**Anni**: “Nope. Just a danger to anyone who tries to ‘Narcan’ my seizures.”

 

**Dr. Lowell clears his throat:** “Well, clinically speaking, you seem stable enough for discharge—”

 

**Anni**: “Great. Can I go now? Because I’d really love to do literally *anything* that doesn’t involve explaining that seizures are not a mental illness.”

 

**She stands before he even finishes writing, grabs her bag, and walks out like the badass she is.**

 

**Later: In the Hospital courtyard, late afternoon. The air smells faintly of salt and disinfectant. There is a single bench sitting under a wind-gnarled tree, overlooking the bay in the distance. Tom sits there with a paper cup of coffee, old denim jacket pulled tight against the breeze. He sees her before she sees him.  Anni, walking out of the discharge doors, plastic bag with her clothes slung over one shoulder, eyes fixed on the pavement.**

 

**Tom raises his coffee in greeting:** “Hey. Thought they’d keep you longer.”

 

**Anni gives a dry laugh:** “They tried. Apparently I’m ‘safe for discharge.’ Translation: I’m someone else’s problem until I seize again.”

 

**She drops onto the bench next to him, dumping her bag at her feet.**

 

**Tom**: “First time they did that to me, I swore I’d never come back here. Two weeks later, I was back. Same damn bench.”

 

**Anni glances at him:** “Guess we’re both slow learners.”

 

**Tom**: “Or stubborn ones.”

 

**They sit in silence for a moment. A gull screeches overhead. Tom takes a sip, then offers her the cup.**

 

**Anni**: “Cold?”

 

**Tom**: “Yeah, but it’s coffee. Cold coffee’s still coffee.”

 

**She takes it, sips, grimaces and hands it back.**

 

**Anni**: “So why’d you press the nurse button?”

 

**Tom**: “You looked like you needed someone to cut in. Didn’t work, but… I figured it’s better to have one person in your corner than none.”

 

**Anni**: “You don’t even know me.”

 

**Tom shrugs:** “Don’t need to. I know the look.”

 

**Anni**: “Thanks. For trying, I mean.”

 

**Tom**: “Kid… I’ve been doing this epilepsy thing for over fifty years. You learn quick. The fight isn’t just in your head. Sometimes it’s in the other persons’ heads, too.”

 

Anni gives him a half-smile: “You sound like my therapist.”

 

**Tom**: “Better looking, though.”

 

**She laughs for real for the first time in days. Tom grins, takes another sip of the cold coffee, and the bay breeze carries away the sting of the psych ward just a little.**



**Tom**: “You got anyone picking you up?”

 

**Anni**: “Nope. My sister ran off.”

 

**Tom**: “Good. I’ll walk you out. Maybe grab something edible.”

 

**Anni**: “Not eggs.”

 

**Tom agrees**: “Not eggs.”

1mlvv8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Electronic_Act7658/comments/1mlvv8n/my_diagnosis_therapy_and_minilife_update/,My Diagnosis + Therapy and Mini-Life Update,"Well hello if anyone is reading this, it’s been a while. This will likely come as a surprise to no one but I have been diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder with narcissistic traits. I have learned a lot about myself in therapy and I’ve come to agree with what a lot of commenters said: if I loved my wife I would leave her. So I did. We resumed couples counseling shortly after I started my individual therapy. I waited until we were in a session to express my thoughts so she could have support and I would as well with navigating this situation. After learning of my diagnosis and what that entails, she ultimately agreed it was for the best. 

I learned that I love her in my own way but it’s not the love she deserves. I did love her, but I have to admit what I truly loved was what she could do for me. Her value to me was the benefits having her in my life provided. Even after this I am still in therapy and I think I will stay for a long time, as long as needed. My therapist doesn’t judge me (at least not openly) and she helps me understand myself more every session. I am not seeing the same therapist I saw the first time- not a great fit. I saw another therapist after her, but respectfully he did not seem very educated in his field. I felt like giving up but I am glad I didn’t because afterwards I met with the therapist I am seeing now. 

Me and my ex-wife still keep in touch but it’s not romantically. It’s more so a mental health check in, I suppose. She asks how my treatment is going and I ask the same. The ultimate goal (for us) is to be friends but not to force it. If it’s possible for us to stay friends, great but if it doesn’t feel right for us we can’t force it. We met for coffee last week after increasing our communications to calling about work and other aspects of our lives but it was extremely awkward and she looked uncomfortable. I understand why.

Many people wanted to know more about my wife’s perspective. I am not her so unfortunately I cannot delve into the deepest parts of her mind but I can relay some of what she shared with me. Certain things she said to me the day we mutually agreed to end things have stuck with me and sometimes resurface to the forefront of my mind. She looked sad but relieved at the same time. I remember vividly how her face looked in that moment. She said that she is rediscovering who she is because being with me destroyed her. 

She is spending more time with friends, looking into new programs/specialties at work, and moved out of her parents home into an apartment once we decided to get divorced. We are still legally married but separated. I offered the house to her but she declined. I will be moving out as well. Being here depresses me. Oh yeah, I also told her she shouldn’t feel guilty for cheating on me because I deserved it. I wasn’t a good person or husband at all. I told her I was glad she found solace in someone when I was treating her so terribly. Me being happy about it was a lie but I hoped it would make her feel better and it seems like it did. I meant what I said about me deserving it and how she shouldn’t feel guilty though.

I honestly like having an anonymous space to vent. I don’t really have friends and I only talk to my therapist about things like this. I think I will update from time to time or post here about my thoughts and feelings. Thanks for reading.",1,1754762420.0,u_Electronic_Act7658,0,0.67,False

I did some tweaking to the nib and re-re-cleaned the feed (I don't think I got it clean the first time). I got some brass shims and used the two thinnest ones (0.001 and 0.002) - the front of the nib was really tight.

So far (fingers crossed) it is writing significantly better. I attached a photo of how it writes now. The top is the Platinum Preppy (M) with a converter. Colorverse ""Coffee Break"" ink. The second line is the Wingsung 698 (F) with the same ink. This is Rhodia paper.

So far so good! No skipping at all so far.

*(Also does anyone know how to get the nib out of the Wingsung 698? The feed just unscrews from the pen, but I can NOT get the nib out. I'm afraid of damaging it, but it felt like I was pulling pretty hard.)*

1mlvr77,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1mlvr77/explore_the_best_compact_deep_fryer_chefman_fry/,Explore the best compact deep fryer Chefman Fry Guy worth it,"Compact kitchen gadgets have been my obsession lately, especially since counter space in my home is sacred territory. The Chefman Fry Guy immediately caught my eye, not only because it's compact but also because the sleek design promised a lot with its stainless steel finish. Often, I've found myself craving crispy fries or succulent wings without the hassle of firing up a cumbersome fryer or relying solely on my oven. This 1000-watt mini fryer felt like a potential game-changer in elevating kitchen convenience. Testing this fryer over several weeks made me fall for its efficiency, though it has its fair share of quirks.

**Design That Fits Anywhere**

I’ve had larger fryers in the past, but they often battled for counter space among blenders or coffee machines. This one felt like a breath of fresh air with its compact dimensions of 9.25"" x 8.46"" x 8"". It nestled effortlessly between my toaster and cutting board, where it didn’t intrude. The stainless steel design isn’t just aesthetically pleasing; it also wipes clean in seconds. That’s essential for messy cooks like me—one misstep with oil and a sleek surface becomes a lifesaver. Honestly, the inclusion of a restaurant-style basket was a thoughtful touch and made me feel more chef-like than usual!

**Performance in a Small Package**

Despite its small size, the fryer packs serious heat thanks to its 1000-watt power. During initial use, I was a little skeptical about whether something so small could tackle batches of fries or chicken. But it heated up to 375°F super-fast and delivered consistent results. I tried frozen fries, battered shrimp, and even churros, and everything fried evenly. The transparent viewing window is a nice addition, although I noticed some condensation during longer cooking tasks, which obstructed my view a bit. I imagine this is a minor hiccup because I just had to pop the lid to peak inside when monitoring the batch.

**Positives**

- Compact size perfect for small kitchens or apartments  
- Reliable heating element for consistent performance  
- Stainless steel body for easy cleanup  
- Dishwasher-safe parts make post-cooking cleanup a breeze  

[See Chefman Fry Guy deals on Amazon now.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b09hw3gfkp/)

**Adjustable Temperature Control is a Win**

Having an adjustable temperature dial on such a small fryer felt luxurious. I experimented with its different settings and found it versatile enough to handle both delicate veggies and larger chunks of meat. My go-to snack in the afternoons has been zucchini sticks, and they crisped up wonderfully without any soggy textures. It’s also a great appliance when my nephew visits and wants his cheesy fries in record time. The fryer adjusts well to different textures and types of food without overcooking.

**Limitations That Stand Out**

While the fryer did meet most expectations, it’s not without its flaws. A few things caught my attention during testing:  

- The oil capacity of 1.6 quarts can feel small for family-sized meals.  
- The viewing window can fog up, making it tricky to check the food often.  
- It lacks advanced features like digital timers or presets found in other models.  

**Alternative Offerings**

Compared to full-fledged fryers like those offered by T-fal or Cuisinart, this one is evidently aimed at casual or solo cooks. Other options often boast higher capacities or digital integration, but they take up much more space. Air fryers like those from Philips also enter the conversation here. While they are healthier, the crispiness I achieved with the Chefman Fry Guy was undeniably better when it came to battered foods. However, if you’re someone who avoids excess oil, alternatives might be a better fit.

**Quality for Price**

The cost-effectiveness of this fryer is notable. For something this compact and versatile, I felt I got excellent value. I can see this being particularly useful for students or anyone living in a tiny apartment looking for quality without breaking the bank. While it would’ve been nice for add-ons like a timer feature, the price justifies what’s included.

## Key Features Analysis

The performance and eco-friendliness of compostable cups heavily rely on their core features.

**Material Composition:** The primary material used in compostable cups is crucial for their biodegradability and functionality. These cups are frequently enough made from plant-based materials, such as polylactic acid (PLA), bagasse (sugarcane fiber), or paper coated with PLA or other compostable linings. The composition dictates the cup's heat resistance, structural integrity, and compostability rate. Understanding the specific breakdown components is notable.

The Material composition directly effects how well the cup can hold drinks. In addition, some materials take longer to decompose than others, so being informed is the best way to make a decision when selecting the right cup. Cups can be constructed from a single or multiple materials and each provides unique properties.

**Compostability Certifications:** Look for certifications from reputable organizations like the Biodegradable Products institute (BPI) or the compost Manufacturing Alliance (CMA). These certifications ensure that the cups meet specific standards for compostability under certain conditions, such as in commercial composting facilities. Certifications provide buyers with confidence that the cups will actually break down as intended, avoiding greenwashing claims.

These certifications act as a safety-net to the claims made by manufactures. Be sure to not only look for this certification, but research the certification and see what it takes to obtain. In addition there are different standards that will determine the effectiveness of these certifications.

**Heat Resistance:** A good compostable cup should be able to withstand the temperatures of hot beverages without deforming or leaking. The heat resistance is frequently enough dictated by the type and thickness of the lining or the base material.Cups intended for hot drinks typically have a thicker PLA lining or are made from sustainable paper stock with specific treatments to improve heat resistance.

the typical heat resistance of most cups on the market range from 180 to 220 degrees fahrenheit. Be sure to verify that you are using the right cup for the appropriate drink. Some people will pour a hot coffee into a cup not designed for hot liquids, this can cause damage to the cup and cause it to leak.

**Structural Integrity:** The cup's structural integrity is critical for preventing leaks and spills,as well as for providing a comfortable grip. This depends on the quality of the materials used, the cup's design, and the bonding of the seams. Reinforced rims and sturdy walls are indicators of a well-constructed compostable cup.

The integrity of a cup can be tested in a variety of methods. When a manufacturer is testing the cup, they will often apply several failure test methods to ensure the right quality standards. Common structural integrity issues can consist of leaking and material breakdown.

**Lid compatibility:** for takeaway applications, lid compatibility is essential. Compostable lids are typically made from PLA or molded fiber. Ensure that the cups and lids are designed to fit securely together to prevent leaks and spills during transport.Standard sizes and worldwide lid designs are preferred for convenience and cost-effectiveness.

Lid compatibility ensures that beverages cannot leak out of the top of the cup. Its beneficial to also verify that the lid is also compostable. Many cups sold on the market are compostable, but the lids are not. This is especially prevelant in the takeaway cup market.

## Core Benefits

Compostable cups offer a multitude of advantages over their traditional plastic counterparts.

**Reduced Environmental Impact:** Switching to compostable cups significantly reduces the amount of plastic waste entering landfills and oceans. The plant-based materials used in these cups decompose naturally, returning valuable nutrients to the soil and minimizing pollution. This supports a circular economy and contributes to a more sustainable habitat.

Reducing plastic waste should always be a top priority when running a business. Making the switch to compostable cups can not only reduce the amount of plastic in landfills, but can also help improve brand image. Customers typically have a higher regard for companies that make an effort to reduce waste and use sustainable materials.**Enhanced Brand Image:** using compostable cups demonstrates a commitment to environmental responsibility, which can improve your brand image and attract eco-conscious customers. Consumers are increasingly seeking out businesses that prioritize sustainability, and offering compostable cups can be a powerful way to showcase your values.

Today, customers are far more environmentally conscious than 20 years ago. With a simple switch to compostable cups, a business can drastically improve how customers perceive its brand. This simple change can provide the edge over competitors and boost sales.

**Compliance with Regulations:** Many cities and states are implementing bans or restrictions on single-use plastics. Adopting compostable cups can help businesses comply with these regulations and avoid potential fines. This proactive approach demonstrates a commitment to regulatory compliance and environmental stewardship.

As governments crack down on single-use plastics,it's essential to stay ahead of the legislation and adapt to these changes. By using compostable cups, a business can ensure that it will not get fined or face business interruptions. In addition, by using compostable materials, a business will be well postioned for future legislative changes.

## faqs Section

Common questions about compostable cups often arise when considering the switch from traditional alternatives.

**Are compostable cups truly compostable?**
Yes,compostable cups are designed to break down in commercial composting facilities within a specified timeframe,typically within 90-180 days. Though, they may not compost as effectively in backyard compost piles due to lower temperatures and different microbial activity. It's important to dispose of them in designated composting bins to ensure proper decomposition.

**Can I use compostable cups for hot liquids?**
Yes,many compostable cups are designed to withstand hot liquids,but it's essential to check the manufacturer's specifications. Look for cups specifically labeled as ""hot cup"" or with a stated heat resistance temperature. Some compostable cups may become soft or leak if exposed to very high temperatures for extended periods.

**What is the shelf life of compostable cups?**
the shelf life of compostable cups depends on the material composition and storage conditions. Generally, PLA-based cups have a shorter shelf life than paper-based cups. Store them in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent premature degradation. It's best to use them within one year of purchase to ensure optimal performance.

**How do I dispose of compostable cups properly?**
Dispose of compostable cups in designated composting bins, typically found at commercial composting facilities, restaurants, and events. If composting facilities are not available, check with your local waste management provider for guidance on proper disposal. Avoid throwing them in regular trash bins, as they will not decompose properly in landfills.

I’m planning a first date and want to make it fun, memorable, and not too over-the-top. What are your go-to ideas or best experiences for a first date? Something casual but still meaningful would be ideal.

I know there’s little point in posting this, and it’s a bit self centred of me given we’re all here suffering, but no one in my real life can truly understand. I’m at my wits’ end with this hell on earth. 

I’ve uprooted myself again and again: moved states, moved apartments four times, got rid of everything I own. For a second, it worked, I six months of remarkable improvement. Then, one stupid mistake. I opened an old laptop I’d sealed away in an airtight box, thinking I was safe, thinking I was better. That single moment dragged me back to square one.

Six months later, the damage still lingers. Everything still feels broken.

I know I have to move again, abandon everything again. But how long can this go on? How many times can I burn my life down before there’s nothing left to rebuild? Is it worth emptying my savings and sinking into debt for something that can be destroyed so easily? Or do I just accept that this is it, and that I’ll either find the courage to end things one day, or live out my life in this unrelenting state. A state that’s keeping me from relating to other humans, keeping me from being the person I wanted to be, the person that I worked to be. 

As a child, I was bullied for being overweight. But I became strong, physically fit, defined by my athleticism, my body, my appearance. I was a handsome young man. Four years into this I’m just a shell, silently screaming with every step I take, pain constantly radiating through my lower body, the madness slowly closing in. To just go on a walk has torturous consequences. Forced to pretend it’s not this bad so the few people I have left won’t disappear like the rest.

I’ve seen glimpses of hope. I know there’s theoretically a way out. But the reality of implementing feels so impossible, so endless and even if I do reach other side, there’s no guarantee it will last.

There’s no one to stand beside me through this. Even the therapists I find can’t quite grasp the weight of it.

More baristas know my name than I have friends at this point. I just go to coffee shops, order matcha because I can’t even drink coffee anymore, and wait for the day to pass by. 

I just want my life back, but it appears, that is too much to ask. ",1,1754761747.0,CIRS,0,1.0,False

1mlvihw,https://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/1mlvihw/robert_hunters_posthumous_letter_to_jerry_garcia/,Robert Hunter's posthumous letter to Jerry Garcia (August 1996),"Dear JG,

it's been a year since you shuffled off the mortal coil and a lot has happened. It might surprise you to know you made every front page in the world. The press is still having fun, mostly over lawsuits challenging your somewhat ...umm... patchwork Last Will and Testament. Annabelle didn't get the EC horror comic collection, which I think would piss you off as much as anything. Nor could Dough Irwin accept the legacy of the guitars he built for you because the tax-assessment on them, icon-enriched as they are, is more than he can afford short of selling them off. The upside of the craziness is: your image is selling briskly enough that your estate should manage something to keep various wolves from various familial doors, even after the lawyers are paid. How it's to be divided will probably fall in the hands of the judge. An expert on celebrity wills said in the news that yours was a blueprint on how not to make a will.

The band decided to call it quits. I think it's a move that had to be made. You weren't exactly a sideman. But nothing's for certain. Some need at least the pretense of retirement after all these years. Can they sustain it? We'll see.

I'm writing this from England, by the way. Much clarity of perspective to be had from stepping out of the scene for a couple of months. What isn't so clear is my own role, but it's really no more problematic than it has been for the last decade. As long as I get words on paper and can lead myself to believe it's not bullshit, I'm roughly content. I'm not exactly Mr. Business.

I decided to get a personal archive together to stick on that stagnating computer site we had. Really started pouring the mustard on. I'm writing, for crying out loud, my diary on it! Besides running my ego full tilt (what's new?) I'm trying to give folks some skinny on what's going down. I don't mean I'm busting the usual suspects left and right, but am giving a somewhat less than cautious overview and soapboxing more than a little. They appointed me webmaster, and I hope they don't regret it.

There are those in the entourage who quietly believe we're washed up without you. Even should time and circumstance prove it to be so, we need to believe otherwise long enough to get some self sustaining operations going, or we'll never know for sure. It's matter of self respect. Maybe it's a long shot, but this whole fucking trip was a longshot from the start, so what else is new?

Your funeral service was one hell of a scene. Maureen and I took Barbara and Sara in and sat with them. MG waited over at our place. Manasha and Keelan were also absent. None by choice. Everybody from the band said some words and Steve, especially, did you proud, speaking with great love and candor. Annabelle got up and said you were a genius, a great guy, a wonderful friend, and a shitty father - which shocked part of the contingent and amused the rest. After awhile the minister said that that was enough talking, but I called out, from the back of the church, ""Wait, I've got something!"" and charged up the aisle and read this piece I wrote for you, my voice and hands shaking like a leaf. Man, it was weird looking over and seeing you dead!

A slew of books have come out about you and more to follow. Perspective is lacking. It's way too soon. You'd be amazed at the number of people with whom you've had a nodding acquaintance who are suddenly experts on your psychology and motivations. Your music still speaks louder than all the BS: who you were, not the messes you got yourself into. Only a very great star is afforded that much inspection and that much forgiveness.

There was so much confusion on who should be allowed to attend the scattering of your ashes that they sat around for four months. It was way too weird for this cowboy who was neither invited nor desirous of going. I said good-bye with my poem at the funeral service. It was cathartic and I didn't need an anti-climax.

A surreal sidelight: Weir went to India and scattered a handful of your ashes in the Ganges as a token of your worldwide stature. He took a lot of flak from the fans for it, which must have hurt. A bunch of them decided to scapegoat him, presumably needing someplace to misdirect their anger over the loss of you. In retrospect, I think Weir was hardest hit of the old crowd by your death. I take these things in my stride, though I admit to a rough patch here and there. But Bob took it right on the chin. Shock was written all over his face for a long time, for any with eyes to see.

Some of the guys have got bands together and are doing a tour. The fans complain it's not the same without you, and of course it isn't, but a reasonable number show up and have a pretty good time. The insane crush of the latter day GD shows is gone and that's all for the best. From the show I saw, and reports on the rest, the crowd is discovering that the sense of community is still present, matured through mutual grief over losing you. This will evolve in more joyous directions over time, but no one's looking to fill your shoes. No one has the presumption.

Been remembering some of the key talks we had in the old days, trying to suss what kind of a tiger we were riding, where it was going, and how to direct it, if possible. Driving to the city once, you admitted you didn't have a clue what to do beyond composing and playing the best you could. I agreed - put the weight on the music, stay out of politics, and everything else should follow. I trusted your musical sense and you were good enough to trust my words. Trust was the whole enchilada, looking back.

Walking down Madrone Canyon in Larkspur in 1969, you said some pretty mindblowing stuff, how we were creating a universe and I was responsible for the verbal half of it. I said maybe, but it was your way with music and a guitar that was pulling it off. You said ""That's for now. This is your time in the shadow, but it won't always be that way. I'm not going to live a long time, it's not in the cards. Then it'll be your turn."" I may be alive and kicking, but no pencil pusher is going to inherit the stratosphere that so gladly opened to you. Recalling your statement, though, often helped keep me oriented as my own star murked below the horizon while you streaked across the sky of our generation like a goddamned comet!

Though my will to achieve great things is moderated by seeing what comes of them, I've assigned myself the task of trying to honor the original vision. I'm not answerable to anybody but my conscience, which, if less than spotless, doesn't keep me awake at night. Maybe it's best, personally speaking, that the power to make contracts and deal the remains of what was built through the decades rests in other hands. I wave the flag and rock the boat from time to time, since I believe much depends on it, but will accept the outcome with equanimity.

Just thought it should be said that I no longer hold your years of self inflicted decline against you. I did for awhile, felt ripped off, but have come to understand that you were troubled and compromised by your position in the public eye far beyond anyone's powers to deal with. Star shit. Who can you really trust? Is it you or your image they love? No one can understand those dilemmas in depth except those who have no choice but to live them. You whistled up the whirlwind and it blew you away. Your substance of choice made you more malleable to forces you would have brushed off with a characteristic sneer in earlier days. Well, you know it to be so. Let those who pick your bones note that it was not always so.

So here I am, writing a letter to a dead man, because it's hard to find a context to say things like this other than to imagine I have your ear, which of course I don't. Only to say that what you were is more startlingly apparent in your absence than ever it was in the last decade. I remember sitting in the waiting room of the hospital through the days of your first coma. Not being related, I wasn't allowed into the intensive care unit to see you until you came to and requested to see me. And there you were - more open and vulnerable than I'd ever seen you. You grasped my hand and began telling me your visions, the crazy densely packed phantasmagoria way beyond any acid trip, the demons and mechanical monsters that taunted and derided, telling you endless bad jokes and making horrible puns of everything - and then you asked, point blank, ""Have I gone insane?"" I said ""No, you've been very sick. You've been in a coma for days, right at death's door. They're only hallucinations, they'll go away. You survived."" ""Thanks,"" you said. ""I needed to hear that.""

Your biographers aren't pleased that I don't talk to them, but how am I to say stuff like this to an interviewer with an agenda? I sometimes report things that occur to me about you in my journal, as the moment releases it, in my own way, in my own time, and they can take what they want of that.

Obviously, faith in the underlying vision which spawned the Grateful Dead might be hard to muster for those who weren't part of the all night rap sessions circa 1960-61 ... sessions that picked up the next morning at Kepler's bookstore then headed over to the Stanford cellar or St. Mike's to continue over coffee and guitars. There were no hippies in those days and the beats had bellied up. There was only us vs. 50's consciousness. There no jobs to be had if we wanted them. Just folk music and tremendous dreams. Yeah, we dreamed our way here. I trust it. So did you. Not so long ago we wrote a song about all that, and you sang it like a prayer. The Days Between. Last song we ever wrote.

Context is lost, even now. The sixties were a long time ago and getting longer. A cartoon version of our times satisfies public perception. Our continuity is misunderstood as some sort of strange persistence of an outmoded style. Beads, bell bottoms and peace signs. But no amount of pop cynicism can erase the suspicion, in the minds of the present generation, that something was going on once that was better than what's going on now. And I sense that they're digging for ""what it is"" and only need the proper catalyst to find it for themselves. Your guitar is like a compass needle pointing the strange way there. I'm wandering far afield from the intention of this letter, a year's report, but this year wasn't made up only of events following your death in some roughly chronological manner. It reached down to the roots of everything, shook the earth off, and inspected them. The only constant is the fact that you remain silent. Various dances are done around that fact.

Don't misconstrue me, I don't waste much time in grief. Insofar as you were able, you were an exponent of a dream in the continual act of being defined into a reality. You had a massive personality and talent to present it to the world. That dream is the crux of the matter, and somehow concerns beauty, consciousness and community. We were, and are, worthy insofar as we serve it. When that dream is dead, there'll be time enough for true and endless grief.

John Kahn died in May, same day Leary did. Linda called 911 and they came over and searched the house, found a tiny bit of coke and carted her off to jail in shock. If the devil himself isn't active in this world, there's sure something every bit as mean: institutional righteousness without an iota of fellow feeling. But, as I figure, that's the very reason the dream is so important - it's whatever is the diametric opposite of that. Human kindness.

Trust me that I don't walk around saying ""this was what Jerry would have wanted"" to drive my points home. What you wanted is a secret known but to yourself. You said 'yes' to what sounded like a good idea at the time, 'no' to what sounded like a bad one. I see more of what leadership is about, in the absence of it. It's an instinct for good ideas. An aversion to bad ones. Compromise on indifferent ones. Power is another matter. Power is not leadership but coercion. People follow leaders because they want to.

I know you were often sick and tired of the conflicting demands made on you by contentious forces you invited into your life and couldn't as easily dismiss. You once said to me, in 1960, ""just say yes to everybody and do what you damn well want."" Maybe, but when every 'yes' becomes an IOU payable in full, who's coffer is big enough to pay up? ""Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke!"" would be a characteristic reply. Unfortunately, you're not around to explain what was a joke and what wasn't. It all boils down to signed pieces of paper with no punch lines appended.

I know what I'm saying in this letter can be taken a hundred ways. As always, I just say what occurs to me to say and can't say what doesn't. Could I write a book about you? No. Didn't know you well enough. Let those who knew you even less write them. You were canny enough to keep your own self to yourself and let your fingers do the talking. Speaking of 'personal matters' was never your shtick.

Our friendship was testy. I challenged you rather more than you liked, having a caustic tongue. In later years you preferred the company of those capable of keeping it light and non-judgmental. I think it must always be that way with prominent and powerfully gifted persons. I don't say that, for the most part, your inner circle weren't good and true. They'd have laid down their lives for you. I'd have had to think about it. I mean, a star is a star is a star. There's no reality check. If the truth were known, you were too well loved for your own good, but that smacks of psychologizing and I drop the subject forthwith

All our songs are acquiring new meanings. I don't deny writing with an eye to the future at times, but our mutual folk, blues and country background gave us a mutual liking for songs that dealt with sorrow and the dark issues of life. Neither of us gave a fuck for candy coated shit, psychedelic or otherwise. I never even thought of us as a ""pop band."" You had to say to me one day, after I'd handed over the Eagle Mall suite, ""Look, Hunter - we're a goddamn dance band, for Christ's sake! At least write something with a beat!"" Okay. I handed over Truckin' next. How was I to know? I thought we were silver and gold; something new on this Earth. But the next time I tried to slip you the heavy stuff, you actually went for it. Seems like you'd had the vision of the music about the same time I had the vision of the words, independently. Terrapin. Shame about the record, but the concert piece, the first night it was played, took me about as close as I ever expect to get to feeling certain we were doing what we were put here to do. One of my few regrets is that you never wanted to finish it, though you approved of the final version I eked out many years later. You said, apologetically, ""I love it, but I'll never get the time to do it justice."" I realized that was true. Time was the one thing you never had in the last decade and a half. Supporting the Grateful Dead plus your own trip took all there was of that. The rest was crashing time. Besides, as you once said, ""I'd rather toss cards in a hat than compose."" But man, when you finally got down on it, you sure knew how.

The pressure of making regular records was a creative spur for a long time, but poor sales put the economic weight on live concerts where new material wasn't really required, so my role in the group waned. A difficult time for me, being at my absolute peak and all. I had to go on the road myself to make a living. It was good for me. I developed a sense of self direction that didn't depend on the Dead at all. This served well for the songs we were still to write together. You sure weren't interested in flooding the market. You knew one decent song was worth a dozen cobbled together pieces of shit, saved only by arrangement. I guess we have a few of those too, but the percentage is respect ably low. Pop songs come and go, blossom and wither, but we scored a piece of Americana, my friend. Sooner or later, they'll notice what we did doesn't die the way we do. I've always believed that and so did you. Once in awhile we'd even call each other ""Mister"" and exchange congratulations. Other people are starting to record those songs now, and they stand on their own.

For some reason it seems worthwhile to maintain the Grateful Dead structures: Rex, the website, GDP, the deadhead office, the studio ... even with the band out of commission. I don't know if this is some sort of denial that the game is finished, or if the intuitive impulse is a sound one. I feel it's better to have it than not, just in case, because once it's gone there's no bringing it back. The forces will disperse and settle elsewhere. A business that can't support itself is, of course, no business at all, just a locus of dissension, so the reality factor will rule. Diminished as we are without you, there is still some of the quick, bright spirit around. I mean, you wouldn't have thrown in your lot with a bunch of belly floppers, would you?

Let me see - is there anything I've missed? Plenty, but this seems like a pretty fat report. You've been gone a year now and the boat is still afloat. Can we make it another year? What forms will it assume? It's all kind of exciting. They say a thousand years are only a twinkle in God's eye. Is that so?

Missing you in a longtime way.

Tim's not just stepping up for the job, he's gunning for 'Dad of the Year.'

Want to use Claude to actually fix real-world problems instead of shipping another AI-powered coffee timer? Here’s how it could run an entire hospital’s IT ticketing.

I’m exploring how to integrate an LLM — and ideally Claude with MCP — into an IT ticketing workflow in a hospital setting.

The goals would be:

Ticket classification & routing: auto-detect category, urgency, impact from the ticket text.

Knowledge retrieval: connect to internal documentation or past tickets to suggest solutions.

Automation: trigger scripts or ticket status changes based on LLM analysis.

Data privacy: keep everything on-prem or in a secure MCP setup.


Has anyone here implemented an MCP toolchain (e.g., filesystem, API calls, search) with Claude for a ticketing system like GLPI, ServiceNow, or Jira?

I’m especially curious about:

How you structure MCP tools for multi-step ticket workflows.

Best practices to keep sensitive hospital data safe.

Examples of automation loops where the LLM actually performs actions, not just suggestions.


This is part of a public hospital / public-interest project — so if any contributor wants to jump in pro bono, you’d be building something useful for society instead of coding for the South Park version of Mickey Mouse and his Satan’s libertarian dust mites.

One thing I noticed — my skin seemed worse whenever my digestion was off. It made me wonder if there was a deeper connection between gut health and skin.

I decided to focus on what I was eating, and here’s what I tried:

Short reset: A few days of simple meals like fresh fruit, steamed vegetables, and herbal tea.

Cutting processed foods: I stopped eating fried snacks, sugary drinks, and heavily packaged foods.

More whole foods: Fresh produce, nuts, seeds, and simple home-cooked meals instead of fast food.

Hydration: More water, less coffee/soda.

Probiotic foods: Things like sauerkraut and plain yogurt made it into my weekly routine.


After a couple of months, I noticed two big changes — my digestion felt lighter, and my breakouts weren’t as intense. Over time, my skin looked calmer and healthier.

I’m not saying this will work for everyone, but for me, focusing on my gut was the turning point.

Has anyone else noticed a link between their digestion and skin?

Grand warfare. Chaos. Explosions. These are the things of a game called *Battlefield*.

Hello. I’m Lars Swedonson from DICE Studios. For over two decades, our team has been delivering high quality, large scale warfare experiences to players all over the world, but mostly to the dudes who played Battlefield 3 in high school.

\[Cut to two “real players.”\] 

**Player 1:** I saw all of it. The destruction physics? Amazing. 

**Player 2:** I dragged a teammate to cover like in an action movie. Thanks, Lars.

\[Cut to Lars.\] Jump into the action with our award winning, next gen shooter package.

\[Clips of gameplay.\] See the tide of war change in real time. Call in an airstrike from a drone. Drive a tank straight through a building. People love it.

But every so often, someone leaves a review saying they “didn’t have as much fun as they thought.” So here at DICE, we like to remind players:

\[Lars looks straight into camera\] If you are sad now, you might still feel sad in game, okay? 

Our game will put you in the middle of an epic firefight  but you will still be you during that firefight. If you are exhausted after work and jump into Conquest, you will be the same burnt out you… just with a rocket launcher.

There is a lot a game can do. Help you unwind. Make you shout “NO WAY” when a building collapses on a squad. But it cannot restore the exact feeling you had when you came home from middle school and played until 3am.

**What we can do:**

We can give you the most realistic sound design in franchise history.  We cannot stop Gen Z from posting new slang in the chatbox.

We can reconnect you with your old squad.  We cannot change that Dave bought a house with Dogecoin.

We can give you the smoothest sniper mechanics yet. We cannot give you back the reflexes you had before you needed coffee just to function.

We can let you pilot a helicopter. We cannot make you forget about that email from your boss marked “urgent.”

Our friendly developers are happy to innovate on the award winning formula, but remember: the clips are still going to have you in them. And if you do not like how you play in other games, you are not suddenly going to be an esports god in Battlefield 6.

\[Cut to two “real players.”\] 

**Player 1:** Right before we spawned in, he took my face in his hands and told me, “If you are bad at shooting, Battlefield is 100% shooting.” 

**Player 2:** So we got the tank stuck on a barrier instead. Best match ever.

\[Cut back to Lars.\] This may sound rude, but I am just trying to temper expectations. I hate seeing people beat themselves up for not recapturing the “good old days”, it really gets to me.  I already work for EA, I don’t need this.

And please, if you think us switching the class equipment around will make this a whole new game, remember: it is a 22 year old franchise. The gameplay loop is older than some of our players.

Look, a match is a long time to be having peak fun the entire way through. Most of us get a couple of solid minutes… if we are lucky. And that is our motto here at DICE Studios.

\[Game bumper.\] **Narrator:** *Battlefield 6 – We can give you the war. We cannot give you back the summer of 2008.*

Hey Charlotte crew,

Just moved here (33M, 4.5+ level) and I’m looking for some solid pickleball partners for both men’s doubles and mixed doubles. I’m all about competitive games, quick hands, and still having a good laugh in between points.

Looking for:
	•	4.5+ players who want to team up for     
             tournaments
	•	Good local leagues, ladders, or open plays
	•	Info on upcoming competitive events in/              around Charlotte 

I’m happy to travel a bit for good matches and I’m always down for some post-game coffee or beer. If you’ve got a partner spot open or know of any good tourneys, drop a comment or shoot me a DM.

1mlvdyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianCivicFails/comments/1mlvdyg/please_learn_some_travel_etiquettes/,Please learn some travel etiquettes,"My post on the India subreddit got deleted. However I’d look to put it here because this seems to be a more appropriate forum

Hi, I’m a frequent flyer. A month back, I was flying to Delhi from Sydney and had a layover at Hong Kong. While travelling,  I’m often reminded of the notorious reputation we have when it comes to Air travel often by cabin crew and occasionally by airport staff. However, at HKG I had the opportunity to witness it firsthand. For context our gate was located in area that didn’t have a lot of shops except for a Starbucks. 

When I arrived at the gate, the sight I got to see was nothing less than horrid. People had no regard to public property at all, coffee cups were just strewn across the floor, some spilt their drinks on the seat and did not care to clean up the mess. Funnily enough, half empty cups were just left on the seat for someone else to throw them into the dustbin. 

I’m aware Indian flyers have the bad reputation of poor travel etiquette but I didn’t expect it to be this bad. Nevertheless, I decided to go to the Starbucks outlet for a cup of coffee and it was here I had the chance to witness the dumbest altercation of my life .

Being a frequent flyer, I’ve had the opportunity to witness some absurd fights between people but the stuff I witnessed at the shop was just downright embarrassing. An Indian uncle was berating the poor staff for not having dustbins inside their shop or near the gate and this was no civil conversation, the man was shouting  at the top of his lungs. Whats ironic was that there were dustbins located right across the gate but I don’t think the man ever had the thought of attempting to find one and instead decided to take off his temper on the poor staff who were absolutely helpless in this matter. I kindly told the guy where the nearest dustbin was in an attempt to de-escalate the altercation and was acknowledged with a “I hope the dustbin is there” in a crude voice. 

The staff members were visibly stressed and profusely thanked me when the guy went away but what broke my heart was when one of them told me that this sort of behaviour was normal everytime there was an India-bound flight!

I like travelling and do my level best in ensuring people have a good impression of what an Indian  tourist is like. However, owing to the actions of people like those in the gate and coffee shop, the bad reputation spillsover to Indian travellers who tend to have a level of civic sense. 

I’m aware of the general state of civic sense in India but it’s just surprising how well-educated, salaried  individuals also fail to have basic courtesy and manners. Posts of civic sense here are  often accompanied with comments of “the target crowd won’t see this post”. However, I don’t think this is true and am fairly certain that there exists a good chunk of people here who are absolutely clueless about social manners and etiquettes. 

I kindly request all to be courteous to the property and people of the country you’re visiting. Travelling to such countries isn’t a right but a privilege and it’s time we stop

1mlvd08,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mlvd08/save_yourself_dont_do_the_right_thing/,"Save Yourself, Don’t Do the Right Thing","The blood was fresh and being soaked up fairly quickly in the old shag carpet. It was a relief honestly. The blood dulled the smell of the cigarette residue that had been built up in the carpet for what I can assume to be decades.

Retched woman. I found her sprawled out on the floor with her curled gray and white hair, and wrinkled, shriveled-up body covered in liver spots. Whoever did this really wanted to get the job done. They not only slit her throat but both her wrists as well. Her children and grandkids won’t be too happy about this, but many more people will sigh, feeling an immense weight lifted off their shoulders.

Two weeks ago I was on the verge of going completely broke. This was nothing new though. Finances and I have never had a good relationship. I know I had a problem, at least half of me acknowledged it. The other half kept spinning that roulette wheel and betting on that one horse to beat the odds. I was always close, but not close enough. I was counting down the dollars at the grocery store, but being careful as to not forget the tax. I refused to be that person who would have to put some food back while checking out. “I think I got this one” I told myself. $45 with some wiggle room. That’ll last me… maybe five days? If I’m lucky?

I was walking through the bread aisle when an old woman with a back hump was pushing a shopping cart in the other direction. As we passed each other, I noticed not only the waft of cigarette smell, but something had fallen to the ground in my peripheral view. I looked down and saw that the old lady had dropped some money. As I went to pick it up, I saw it was two, crumbled-up $100 bills. I felt in my chest what I can only describe as getting giddy like a child. I had the immediate instinct to shove it into my jacket pocket and walk away. But, I didn’t. Caution override the desire of thievery. 

It’s $200. I’m sure she would report the money missing to the grocery store just to be safe, and they would catch me on camera taking it. There was one of those black orb-looking cameras on the ceiling in the aisle right next to me where the blacked-out cover of it was to prevent people from knowing where the camera was looking. Also, the bills were in rough condition. What if she just managed to save enough money for a full grocery shopping trip for once? She very well could be broke like me. For some reason, this oldie hit a soft spot in me.

“Excuse me ma’am, I think you dropped this.” She turned to me to see if I was talking to her or someone else. She had bright turquoise eyes. I’ve never seen eyes that color before. They were very pretty, but they sent a shiver down my spine because of how odd they were. I noticed I had paused too long looking at her eyes. “....Sorry, I think you dropped some money.” I handed her the $200.

She was shocked. “Oh, thank you very much. How did I manage to do that? Thank you.” I nodded, and as I began to walk away, she continued. “Wait, I have something for you.” She reached into a small purse, and with the crumbled bills I handed back to her, she handed me two more crisp $100 bills. $400 total. I assumed she was not aware of what she was doing.

“Ma’am, no need.” I put my hand out to gently push her hand back. “I’m aware,” she said. “And now it’s yours.” She re-extended her hand, now eagerly getting me to take the money. I replied, “That’s very kind of you, but there’s no way I could take this. That’s a lot of money.” She replied, “You could have walked away with what you found. But you didn’t. Now, you have double.” There was a brief pause while I contemplated taking the money or not. “If I needed it I wouldn’t be giving it to you” she said. I took the money from her. “Thank you,” I replied. “You don’t know how much this means to me.”

She looked at my shopping cart which so far only had a loaf of bread and a can of baked beans. “It looks like you have some shopping to do” she said with a smile before turning around and pushing her cart away.

If you know the mind of an addict, I’m sure this comes as no surprise. I spent $150 on groceries and the rest I immediately went to the casino that is conveniently seven minutes away from my apartment. The next horse race was the next day, but I couldn’t wait. I knew I was going to make it big this time. Screw the tables, I didn’t want to waste my money having to tip the croupier. I went first to the slot machines. I was going to spend maybe $20, $50 at most if I didn’t win, which I thought at least I’d make a little. But only half an hour later I realized I spent $200. I got caught up in it. I needed to get my head in the game. 

I went up to the “self-serve” roulette table. A chair was open. Six other people sat around the wheel staring as it went round and round. Everybody anticipating that big break. That spin concluded. Some people groaned, some said nothing. I looked at my digital screen. Normally with roulette I like to spread my chances out; pick multiple numbers, overlap, etc. But something was telling me to put my whole $50 left on number seven. The guy sitting next to me saw my bet and scoffed.

“I’ve been losing money here for an hour. You’re not going to win that bet” he said. He noticed the others at the table were looking at us. He grinned. “If it lands on seven, I’ll give you an extra $50. If you lose, you owe me $50” he said. There was a short pause. “Same here. No way you’re winning that” a woman sitting across the table said. “I will too” the man sitting next to her said. All six people were putting in $50 each. An extra $300 on top of my incoming winnings. I couldn’t resist.

“Alright” I said confidently. My heart sank. My face went flush. What have I done? The roulette ivorine was released, and round it went. I glanced back and forth between the wheel and the others. They were glancing back and forth between the wheel and me. It landed. Eight. It landed on eight. They cheered. Fight or flight kicked in. I reached into my jacket pocket. I decided I was going to pretend to get the money out of my wallet and then book it out of the casino. 

When I opened my wallet, expecting nothing, were multiple crisp $50 bills. Seven of them. I tried to hide my shock and play it cool. I started to hand out the $50 bills to each of them. I sat back down. I was left again with $50. I… did seven. I put it all on seven again. I don’t know why, but I did. Everyone at the table laughed at me. Pity laughed. 

The wheel spun. Everyone at the table was grinning, watching the wheel, waiting to make fun of me again. It landed. It was seven. The $50 that appeared in my wallet turned into $250. I made my money back. Everyone looked at me in utter disbelief. Again, I don’t know what took over me, but I put the whole $250 on eight. Now everyone was getting really irritated.

“Are you kidding me?” one guy said. “This is ridiculous” another woman said.

The wheel spun. There was an anticipation at that table I had never experienced before. It landed. It was eight. I had won another $250. I had never walked away with a single dollar gambling before. Not a penny. Everyone got pissed; in general, at the circumstance. Not at me. Thank god. Three people at the table got up and walked away angry. The force that had overcome me “told” me to leave the table. So, I did. I walked out of the casino. Normally I would keep going, but something was telling me to stop. Something.

I entered my little apartment and tossed my keys onto the kitchen table. Very cliche for a person struggling with money, I looked at the two overdue credit card bills and electric bill notices also sitting on the table. I sat down. What just happened? Finally winning with anything involving gambling didn’t feel as good as I thought it would. Facing again the fact that I am an addict, how was I even able to walk away from the table without spending all my winnings away?

I honestly became alarmed when I felt the urge to deposit my winnings at the bank tomorrow to start paying off my debts. Responsibility was a new desire for me. I got up and grabbed my jacket and keys. I felt antsy all of a sudden. I decided to go grab a coffee at the coffee shop across the street. I got my iced Americano and decided to stand outside the coffee shop to feel the breeze. After a couple of minutes, an older woman with a cane started to walk up the sidewalk. It was weird. I hadn’t seen her cross the street or walk up from down the way. I realized after a moment that it was the same woman from the grocery store.

“Oh hello there. What a pleasant surprise. How are you?” The woman said this to me as though we had known each other for years. Her smile was kind, but her turquoise eyes showed no emotion. “…Good, just grabbing some coffee. How ‘bout you?” I said. “Me too. An iced Americano always makes my day” she said. She stopped in front of me and continued. “How has the rest of your day been?” referencing since we met at the grocery store. “Good. Thanks again” I replied. The woman grinned.

“Be careful now. Nothing stays for long. The good and the bad come and go” she said. I assumed she was making a corny old-person comment to spend the money she gave me wisely. I pretended her comment wasn’t annoying and arrogant, like how people want the barista to see and thank them for putting money in the tip jar. I gave her a “warm” smile.

She walked around me. I heard the little metal bells the coffee shop put on top of the door jingle as she walked in. I turned around curious to see the reaction of the employees to her, if she was a regular or not so I would know if I would see her again. But, she wasn’t there. The coffee shop wasn’t big. You can see the whole front of the coffee shop through the window and the door. She was nowhere to be found. There’s no possible way she could have gone anywhere else in the second she went around me to enter the coffee shop. She was gone.

Oddly enough, I felt pretty calm. I could tell this reaction was definitely from this new force or state I’ve been in since the casino earlier. It was bizarre, but I didn’t feel the need to question what I just witnessed. At least not right then. I sipped my last bit of coffee and crossed the street back to my apartment. Again, I hung up my jacket and put my keys on the table. It was only 3:00pm, but I suddenly became so drained. Just utterly tired. I showered and went to bed.

I woke up at 7:00am. I felt refreshed. I got up and had my cup of coffee while watching birds and passersby outside my living room window. I had some cereal, showered, and headed out to the bank to deposit my winnings from the day before. Waiting in line at the bank, I felt a wave of nervousness come over me. I didn’t know what was happening. I kept going back and forth between feeling really good and pure dread. When it was my turn, I handed the teller my deposit slip and took my wallet out to hand her the money. What I found was not only the winnings, but an extra $50. I paused for a moment. Am I becoming forgetful? The teller waited.

“Sir, are you making a deposit?” she said. “Yes. Sorry. Here” I replied. I handed her the amount I won. I kept the new $50 bill. I left the bank. Off to the race track I went.

It wasn’t busy. Only a quarter of the people that normally fill the betting room were there. I looked at the horses racing that day. I never understood why they gave the horses weird names that sound like a child from the 1940’s make them up. “Flash Trixie?” “Corn-of-Copia?” What even is that? The force from yesterday washed over me again. My focus went toward horse #7. I didn’t bother to catch its name. The odds were in the middle. The horse had a pretty average record. Not great, but not bad. I went to the counter.

I kept it short. “On #7. First place” I said and slid my cash over to the betting teller. Dead-eyed, he took my money. As the cash left my hand, I saw what I handed over. Five $100 bills. I thought I just deposited $500 at the bank? I wanted to stop him, but I couldn’t. At that brief moment, I was unable to talk or move. He handed me a ticket and I just walked away. I went outside and stood there, watching the track as the horses lined up ready to go. An overly confident, drunk man stood near me. He turned when he saw me walk up to watch.

“Which ones you got?” he said, meaning what was my bet. “#7” I said. “What place?” he asked. “First” I replied. He scoffed. “I mean, I guess you could have chosen worse. Good luck” he said. I ignored him.

The bell rang and the horses were off. Only a couple of the jockeys kept back to conserve energy. Most of the horses started at full force. I could feel the ground vibrate from the stands from the galloping. Though the speed was incredible, there wasn’t much movement. All the horses kept their places where they started. Then, #8, something along the lines of “Blitz of Coffee” charged forward to the head of the pack, maintaining first place. #7 remained toward the back, maybe third from last.

“Oh geez. You’re not doing too good buddy” the guy said to me. I ignored him again. The race was maybe half done. Then, #7 got some wind in its sails. It pushed forward. Third from last, fifteenth, twelve, eighth, then third place.

“I put #8 on first” the man said. “It looks like it’s gonna take it home” Inch by inch, the horses about 80% done, #7 got into second place. My heart began to pound. They were in the final stretch. They were going and going. #7 kept pushing. And then… they were done. #8 crossed the finish line in first place. #7 placed second maybe one hoof away from #8. The man next to me cheered and waved his ticket in the air. “Yes. Yes. That’s how you do it.”

He turned to me. “Maybe next time bud.” He went inside to collect his winnings. As he was entering the door to the betting room, two tall, broad muscular men and a short man in a suit walked out, coming toward me. When they got to me, the short man looked at me as though he was waiting for me to do something.

“...Hi?” I said to him. “Well?” the short man said. There was a pause. “Pay up” the man said, irritated. “I don’t know what you’re talking about” I replied. The man scoffed and looked down, pinching the bridge of his nose, becoming more irritated. “Pay up. You lost. That was the deal. You owe me two-grand” he said. I was shocked. “What?” I said. “What are you talking about? I bet $50… or $500. No strings attached.” The man clearly had enough of me.

“Alright, let’s go. Inside.” As the man said that, the two bigger men started to walk toward me. I didn’t know what was going on. I bolted. I didn’t even look behind me to see if they were running after me or not. I just kept running. I got in my car and sped home.

I rushed into my apartment and locked the regular lock and the two deadbolts on my door. I just stood there for a minute, processing everything. I thought I must be mentally deteriorating. I’m imagining money switching amounts within the blink of an eye. I wasn’t remembering doing certain transactions or bets. I needed to see a doctor immediately, but this is the U.S. healthcare system. I didn’t know if I had the money to do so. I didn’t need any more debt.

I went online and paid my electric bill just to give me some sort of comfort in the moment. I checked my bank account, it showed that I did in fact deposit the money I knew I deposited, so that was good at least. I then sat at my kitchen table for about two hours going back and forth between fiddling around with apps on my phone and watching the door. I wanted to make sure the guys at the race track didn’t know where I lived. I think my brain was trying to protect me from the trauma of all of this by having me suddenly become exhausted from the anxiety and shut down. I quickly fell asleep.

The nightmare I had was surreal to say the least. I was in a pitch-black room. Or black space. It didn’t feel exactly like a room. I was able to stand on a solid floor or ground, but it still felt like endless darkness. No actual floor, walls, or ceiling. About twenty feet in front of me stood the old woman who had given me the money, who I had seen three times now, including this nightmare. She just stared at me. She stared at me with those bizarre turquoise eyes. It felt like an eternity but it must have been only five seconds.

She extended her cupped hand to reveal a small, black kitten. It must have been only a few days old. It was squealing like newborn kittens do, wanting its mother or to be fed. I hesitated for a moment, but the squealing wouldn’t stop. I didn’t know why the old woman wasn’t doing anything about it. She just held the kitten forward, wanting me to take it. A nurturing part of myself took over, so I extended my cupped hand. Without either the old woman or I moving from our places, the black kitten appeared in my hand.

Still squealing, I held it close. “Shhhh, it’s okay” I said to it. I held it close to my chest and began to gently pet it with my other hand. The kitten gradually became quiet and started purring. I looked back up at the old woman. She was still just staring at me.

After a moment, the kitten went silent. It must have fallen asleep. Then, it happened. The fire. My hands began to burn. The kitten had self-combusted. It started screaming a vocalization of pain I had never heard before. A scream I couldn’t recognize as a human or non-human animal. It was warped. It sounded like more than one living thing screaming in utter pain. I dropped the kitten and it hit the floor. I felt horrible for dropping it, but my hands were literally burning from it. It continued to scream. I looked up again at the old woman, she was now smiling. Grinning.

The kitten became silent once again, and the fire burned out. Its charred body sat there lifeless, smoldering. Once again, I looked up, and the old woman’s face now appeared maybe an inch in front of mine. This woke me. I jolted up in my bed in a sweat. The nightmare had felt so real. So unnerving. It was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced.

I took a moment to gather myself before getting out of bed with some deep breathing. I showered and then made some coffee. I sat at my kitchen table still collecting myself. I decided I needed to get out and move around. Maybe get some more coffee across the street to get my dopamine levels high. I walked over to my window to see if the coffee shop was busy or not. I froze. In front of the coffee shop, a man was talking with the same old woman. The feeling that had overtaken me previously before was now panic. The old woman reached into her purse and began to hand the man money. I needed to intervene.

I opened the window and began to yell. “Hey. Hey man. Don’t do it. Don’t talk with her. She’s not ok. She’s trying to trick you. Walk away.” The man looked up at me alarmed and confused. The old woman looked up at me with a subtle yet intense anger. I continued. “It’s not safe. Don’t do it. Go away. Now.”

The man looked away from me and started to walk backward for a moment, looking at the old woman just as startled as he was looking at me. Then he turned around and speed-walked away. The old woman now turned fully facing my direction, holding the same, angry look. She just stood there, staring at me. I quickly closed the window. As I looked back down in front of the coffee shop, the old woman had disappeared. As I turned around, I saw something on the kitchen table where I had been sitting. I walked over to the table. It was a wrinkled $1 bill with multiple brown, splotchy stains all over it.

I’m not religious. I’m not spiritual. I don’t know if I would consider myself agnostic, or even atheist. I do however believe, as many would agree, that there are some things that simply can’t be explained by (though legitimate) scientific processes. It was clear that something was deeply wrong here. I could continue to let things spiral, or I can try and stop this now while I have control over my own life. Control over the parts of my life I haven’t given up on my own.

I decided to burn it. The easiest way to destroy it. I grabbed a lighter out of a drawer in the kitchen, lit the dollar bill on fire, and tossed it into the metal basin of my kitchen sink. It burned, and then, nothing. Nothing in particular happened besides the dollar turning to ash. I looked around my apartment. Nothing. I saw nothing change, and I felt nothing change. I washed the ashes down the drain.

Three knocks were made on my door. I grabbed a kitchen knife nearest to me. I looked through the peephole, no one was standing there. Were they waiting for me around the corner? I decided the best bet was, even if it left me vulnerable, to open my door wide, wait a moment to see if anyone lunges expecting me to walk out, and then run out with my knife. One, two, three. I opened the door. Nothing. I rushed out with the knife and frantically looked back and forth toward both sides of the hallway. No one.

I looked down and saw a square envelope on the ground. I bent down and picked up the envelope. The front was blank. I went back into my apartment and quickly locked the door. I opened the envelope and pulled out what seemed to be a page torn out of a small notebook. It read: “She got me too - 137 \[redacted\] St.”

Truly, reading that, I felt less alone. Though the overall situation was still messed up, if this person was being honest, they were also going through something the old woman had done to them. If it was a trap, then I shouldn’t go to the address at all, right? Especially not right now, when they are expecting me. However, I knew I couldn’t wait for things to get worse. My reality was being distorted. I needed to act while I could. I grabbed my keys, put my jacket on, and put the knife in the inner pocket.

I pulled up to the address parking across the street. It was a fairly plain one-floor home. Light beige-painted brick with some grey siding. White garage doors. Some bushes near the front windows seemed only partially trimmed. One cheap rainbow pinwheel was in the dirt where the bushes were planted, blowing in the breeze. I walked up the short, worn asphalt driveway to the front door. Before knocking, I tried to see into the windows from where I was standing, but it was too dark inside. I knocked, three times. No one answered. I knocked again. No one answered. I stood there for a moment, thinking what to do next. I put my ear up to the door to see if I could hear anyone inside, doing anything at all. It was silent. I tried the doorknob. As though it was well-oiled, the turn of the knob made its clicking sound and the door slid slightly open.

I carefully took a few steps inside. “Hello?” I called out. No one responded. There was a hallway in front of me lined with family photos on each side. From where I stood I couldn’t make out the faces in the pictures. The hallway led to what I partially could see as a vinyl-floored kitchen with old wooden cabinets. To my left was a hallway with dark green carpeting that I’m assuming led to bedrooms. To my right was an entranceway to a room that bent around the left corner. I would try there first.

I slowly walked in. When I could fully see the room, I stopped and took it in. The room smelled of cigarettes. To my right, there was an old behemoth of a TV maybe from the 1990’s that was turned off, sitting on a wooden table that had a doily tablecloth draped over it. To my left was an armchair with a TV stand next to it with a remote sitting on top. I couldn’t make out the armchair color. Dark olive green? Off-brown? Laying on the ground in front of the armchair, sprawled out, was the old lady.

The blood was fresh and being soaked up fairly quickly in the old shag carpet. Where the blood didn’t create a shade of crimson, the carpet matched the light beige of the outside of the house. It was a relief honestly. The blood dulled the smell of the cigarette residue that had been built up in the carpet for what I can assume to be decades. Whoever did this really wanted to get the job done. They not only slit the old woman’s throat but both her wrists as well. Her children and grandkids, and others I assume were in the photos in the entrance hallway, won’t be too happy about this; but many more people will sigh, feeling an immense weight lifted off their shoulders.

I heard something, what sounded like a wooden door from the direction of the bedrooms hallway closed. I began to hear light footsteps on the carpet. I bolted out of there, out the front door which I left open, to my car, and sped down the road not looking back.

Two weeks had gone by. I read online from a local news outlet that the police found the scene at the old woman’s house and that the investigation is ongoing. In any other circumstance, I would have reported it to the authorities, especially as I didn’t want to be framed for something I didn’t do. But, this was not a murder. This was someone who put an end to a malevolent force. How would I be able to explain any part of what I went through to the police anyway? I would not only be charged with murder but most likely thrown in a psychiatric ward for an even longer time than I would have serving time in a regular prison. I thought if the police were to arrest me, so be it. Till then, I was a free man. Free of what the old woman was doing and was planning to do to me. Going forward, I told myself I would not do the right thing. I would not return dropped money. I would not take it either. Dropped money, helping an elderly person cross the street, it’s simply not happening. I’m not going to be the good guy or the bad guy.

I started going to recovery meetings to address my gambling addiction, and I already noticed my life starting to improve. For once in my life I started to be more confident in myself and my abilities. I even applied for a job that not only paid more but aligned with my passions and interests. I got an offer and I let them know I could start the following week. 

I woke up on a Sunday feeling refreshed. I got up and made some coffee and sat near the window to watch people pass by. The wind was making the trees sway, and the leaves rushed down the sidewalk. The coffee shop across the street was moderately busy with people lining up inside to escape the cold and warm their hands with a mug of the shop’s fresh brew. I finished my cup of coffee and went over to put it in the sink. When I placed my cup in, I saw something crumbled up sitting in the drain. I used my index and middle fingers and successfully pulled it out. Once it was in my hand, I unfolded what appeared to be a piece of paper, which I then discovered to be a $1 bill.",1,1754761200.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

After 6 months of renting out a basement suite this is my first really bad experience. For context I am in a quiet residential neighborhood not nightclub central. Mostly, I get people who want a peaceful simple place to crash while spending most of their time exploring the city.

Well that pattern broke with the 3 people staying till tomorrow - Thursday night they came back at 2 am and LOUDLY talked and slammed doors as they came in. Last night the mom and adult daughter woke me up by having a screaming match in my front yard at 11pm. I had to go out there and tell them to keep it down in hopes of not pissing off my neighbors any further. 

I usually stay out of the basement when I have guests but had to go down there today because the smell of burned coffee from the coffee maker they left on was overwhelming. No surprise but the place was a mess.

I’m not really sure the best way to deal with this, they’re definitely getting a negative review though. Mostly just wanted to vent.

1mlv8sl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1mlv8sl/explore_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_bodum_and/,Explore the Best Pour Over Coffee Maker Bodum and Is It Worth It,"The Bodum 11592-01US pour-over coffee maker has become my go-to for brewing coffee, and as someone who considers coffee a sacred part of the morning routine, this product has left a lasting impression. With its sleek, compact design and reusable stainless steel filter, I dove headfirst into testing it for my daily caffeine fix. Its blend of simplicity and sophistication seems tailored for anyone who loves a flavorful, aromatic cup without spending a fortune at coffee shops.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me was its aesthetic appeal. The product’s black sleeve and borosilicate glass carafe fit beautifully on my kitchen countertop. While it looks stylish, the borosilicate glass isn’t just about appearances—it’s sturdy and doesn’t retain any flavors or odors, ensuring every cup is as fresh as the grind. At just over six inches tall, its compact size makes it easy to store when not in use. I dropped it once (don’t ask), and it survived without cracks, which speaks to its quality. 

[Check Bodum 11592-01US price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b0d6xrlss8/)

**Ease of Use and Operation**  
This coffee maker is delightfully simple to use, even for folks who might not be familiar with pour-over brewing techniques. You don’t need an engineering degree—just add coffee grounds, pour in hot water, and let gravity do the magic. It took me less than four minutes to get a steaming mug of coffee with little hassle, and as someone who’s half-asleep in the morning, I appreciated its straightforward design. The manual operation, paired with its reusable stainless steel filter, eliminates the need for wasteful paper filters, which is not only cost-efficient but eco-friendly. 

**Flavor Quality and Brewing Performance**  
Using this pour-over system consistently yielded smooth, full-bodied coffee. The stainless steel filter allows those essential oils from the coffee beans to seep through, creating a richer and bolder taste. I even tried it with inexpensive supermarket coffee grounds, and the result was impressive enough to rival my local café. The filter does a great job of keeping out grit while retaining flavor. However, if you prefer your coffee ultra-clean, you might notice a slight fine sediment at the bottom of the cup. It didn’t bother me, but I know finicky drinkers might find it worth mentioning.

**Advantages**  
- The borosilicate glass ensures no unwanted flavors or odors stick around.  
- Environmentally friendly with no need for disposable paper filters.  
- Compact design doesn’t demand much kitchen real estate.  
- Solid glass construction feels durable enough for everyday use.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Cleaning the stainless steel filter can be a little tedious, especially if grounds stick inside.  
- Pour-over brewing requires a bit of attention and patience—not ideal when in a rush.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance**  
Dishwasher-safe components? Yes, please! While the carafe and sleeve are dishwasher friendly, I found that rinsing them under warm water was often sufficient after each use. The filter, on the other hand, does need more thorough cleaning. I typically soak it in hot water to loosen stuck coffee grounds before giving it a quick scrub. If you’re someone who avoids manual cleaning like me, this might be mildly inconvenient. That said, the trade-off for not using disposable filters is worth it, both environmentally and financially.

**Other Options**  
Pour-over coffee is such a niche category that alternatives like Chemex or Hario often compete for attention. The Chemex has a similar aesthetic appeal but requires paper filters, which can detract from eco-friendliness. Hario’s dripper includes solid brewing results but lacks the integrated carafe, meaning you’d need a separate vessel. Compared to these brands, the Bodum 11592-01US stands out with its reusable filter and all-in-one design, catering to both functionality and environmental consciousness. However, Chemex might still win if you’re looking for a cleaner brew minus any sediment.

**Smart Spending**  
For its price point, this product delivers fantastic value. The ability to skip paper filters and still enjoy bold, café-style coffee is absolutely worth the investment. While it may not have fancy programmable features like drip machines, its simplicity and durability offer more than enough bang for the buck. If you’re someone who values quality coffee without overcomplicating the process, it’s hard to find a better option in this category.

Fourth place.

The two words taste like battery acid in my mouth as I watch Charles storm through the garage.

His race suit unzipped to the waist, blonde hair plastered to his head with sweat and fury. The Spanish sun has been brutal all weekend, but nothing compared to the heat radiating off him right now.

I know what's coming before he even opens his mouth.

The tightness in his jaw, the way his hands clench and unclench… He needs someone to blame, and lucky me, I'm wearing the target today.

""The brake balance was wrong."" His German accent thickens when he's pissed, turning the words into weapons. ""I told you I needed more front bias for sector two!""

The janitor, who's just here to mop up spilled energy drinks and existential despair, pauses mid-swipe and glances at us like Charles just started speaking in Morse code.

I don’t blame him.

Front bias means shifting more of the braking power to the front wheels—helps keep the rear from stepping out in tricky sections. Like sector two. I know that.

I wish I could explain it to the poor guy.

But right now, I’m too busy not stabbing Charles with my stylus.

""I calculated based on your practice feedback—"" I start, but Charles is already in full attack mode.

""Your calculations were wrong, Farnese. *Again*.""

The garage is cemetery-quiet.

Twenty pairs of eyes swivel our way, mechanics frozen mid-task like they're watching a car crash in slow motion. Which, honestly, they kind of are.

""This is the championship, not amateur hour,"" Charles continues, his voice rising with each word. ""One mistake like that could cost us everything!""

My face burns hot enough to melt steel. The worst part? He's not wrong. But being right doesn't give him license to eviscerate me in front of the entire team.

My temper, the Italian fire I inherited from Papa along with his stubborn streak, ignites.

""I know what I'm doing, *Weinberg*. One small adjustment doesn't make *me* incompetent.""

""Then prove it. He steps closer, gray eyes cold as winter rain. “Because right now, *your* work is costing *me* points.""

The air between us crackles. Not just with anger and irritation, but with the same pull that’s haunted me for over a year.

Logic says run. But right now, fury wins.

""Maybe if you gave clearer feedback instead of expecting me to read your mind—""

""Maybe if you were actually qualified for this level—""

""Debrief.” Parker's voice cuts through our verbal sparring match like a checkered flag ending a race. “Conference room. Now.""

Our team principal looks thoroughly unimpressed with both of us, and I know we'll both catch hell for this later.

Charles shoots me one last withering look before stalking off, leaving me standing there with my professional dignity in tatters and my personal resolve wobbling like a damaged front wing.

Six hours later, the garage is a ghost town. Just me, my laptop, and enough self-loathing to fuel a rocket to Mars. I've run the calculations twelve times, adjusted every parameter, cross-referenced with historical data.

Tomorrow's setup will be perfect, even if it kills me.

The sound of footsteps makes me tense. I know that stride, measured and purposeful. Like everything else about Charles Weinberg.

He's changed into civilian clothes: dark jeans and a black t-shirt that clings in ways that should be illegal in most countries.

""You're still here.""

His voice has lost the sharp edges from earlier, but tension still hums underneath.

I don't look up from my screen. Can't. Won't. ""Fixing my apparently *amateur work*.""

He moves closer and he studies me, and I hate how my body responds to his proximity. Pavlovian conditioning at its finest.

""Eva.""

Just my name, but the way he says it, low and rough around the edges, makes me look up despite myself.

And there it is: the look that's been my downfall for thirteen months running.

Hunger mixed with frustration mixed with something I refuse to name because naming it would make it real, and Charles doesn't do real.

He made that crystal clear a few months ago when I was stupid enough to ask what we were to each other.

*""Nothing. There's nothing between us and there never could be.""*

The memory stings fresh as a paper cut.

""I was frustrated,"" he says quietly, moving behind my chair. ""The team was watching…""

""So you humiliated me instead.""

The words come out steadier than I feel, but my anger is a complicated thing now. Tangled up with want and hurt and the pathetic hope that maybe this time will be different.

His hands grip the back of my chair, knuckles white with restraint.

""I don't apologize for wanting to win."" His breath ghosts across my ear, sending involuntary shivers down my spine. ""But I shouldn't have taken it out on you. Not in front of everyone. I’m sorry.""

I spin in my chair, suddenly trapped between him and the desk, our faces inches apart.

""This doesn't change anything,"" I whisper, even as my pulse goes NASCAR-fast.

""It never does,"" he agrees, voice rough as gravel.

The space between us feels electric, like that moment before lightning strikes when all the hair on your arms stands up and you know you're completely fucked.

His eyes drop to my mouth, and I swear I can feel that look like a physical touch.

When he's moving closer, I'm not backing away. His hand comes up, thumb's tracing along my bottom lip, and we both know that it's doing absolutely devastating things to my decision-making capabilities.

I tilt my chin up, close enough now that I can feel his breath against my skin, and then we’re kissing like the world is ending.

His mouth is hot and greedy on mine. I’m clawing at his t-shirt, desperate to feel his skin, and he’s got his hands tangled in my hair, pulling just hard enough to make me gasp.

He hoists me up onto the workbench like I’m a ragdoll, tools clattering to the floor, and I don’t give a shit about the noise.

“We shouldn’t,” I pant against his mouth, my voice shaking because my body’s already screaming *‘yes’*.

“We never should,” he growls back, his teeth nipping at my neck. “But we always do.”

Before I can protest, he’s lifting me like I’m nothing, carrying me through the dim-lit hallways, and my legs wrap around him instinctively.

I know where we're going—the storage annex between engineering and simulation, a locked utility room. The lock clicks behind us and Charles presses me against the wall with enough force to knock the breath from my lungs.

His mouth crashes into mine again, and this time there’s no hesitation. He kisses me like he’s trying to fucking own me, and I’m letting him.

My hands are already tearing at his clothes, pulling his t-shirt up, my nails digging into his chest. His fingers are on my waist, slipping under the waistband of my pants, and I arch into him because I need more, now.

“Charles…” I gasp, my voice.

“Yeah?” he says, his lips brushing my ear. “Tell me what you want.”

I don’t answer with words. I grab his hand and shove it right between my legs, practically begging him to touch me.

He doesn’t need to be told twice—his fingers slide under my panties, finding me soaking wet, and I bite down on his shoulder to stifle the moan that’s ready to tear out of me.

“Fuck…” he growls, his fingers pressing harder, circling exactly where I need them.

My hips buck against his hand, craving more, and he gives it to me.

His fingers slide into me, fucking me with a rhythm that’s so perfect—I can’t think straight. His thumb circles the most sensitive spot, and I’m already trembling, my legs shaking as I cling to him.

“Charles,” I whimper, my voice barely audible. “Don’t stop…”

“Never,” he promises, his breath hot against my neck. “Not until you’re screaming my name.”

And I know I will.

Because when it comes to Charles Weinberg, I’ve never been able to say no.



# chapter 2

Aug 7, 2025

Monaco.

Where billionaires cosplay as regular people and regular people pretend they belong. The whole principality reeks of money and desperation, which makes it the perfect backdrop for Formula 1's most prestigious shitshow.

I'm elbow-deep in suspension geometry when my phone buzzes with another tabloid alert.

*""Nexus Racing First Driver, Elio Black, Spotted with Mystery Blonde at Jimmy'z.""*

Original.

The man goes through women like I go through brake pads—frequently and without much thought about long-term durability. He's Nexus Racing’s star driver, which only makes the headlines sting more.

Opposite side of the pit lane, same mess of distraction.

""That's the third one this week,"" Adison, our Apex Nova's head of strategy, comments, peering over my shoulder. ""Man's got stamina.""

""Man's got issues,"" I correct, adjusting the rear camber with more force than necessary.

The movement makes my shoulder twinge, a souvenir from last week's storage room athletics with Charles.

Speaking of the devil, Charles emerges from his driver's room looking like he stepped out of a Monaco tourism ad. Pressed team polo, perfectly styled blonde hair, expression that could freeze hellfire.

We perfected the art of professional indifference a long time ago—no lingering looks, no accidental touches. No acknowledgment that four days ago he had me pressed against a wall whispering my name like a prayer.

""Front wing adjustment for FP2?"" His tone is clinical, like I'm Siri with a wrench.

""Already done. Two degrees positive on the flap angle.""

What I don’t say—though I *want* to—is that this means more downforce on the front of the car. More grip. Which he’ll need through Turn 3 and Turn 11, where he’s been sliding in just a little too hot and losing time.

I’ve already run the numbers. Watched the data. Thought it through before he even parked the damn car.

But I keep it short. Simple. Like always.

I don't look up from my laptop. Two can play the ice queen game.

He hovers for a beat too long, and I feel rather than see his internal debate. Then:

""Good. The balance felt off through Turn 11 at Mirabeau.""

And just like that he's gone, leaving behind my stupid accelerated heart rate.

Practice goes smooth as silk—P3 in FP1, P2 in FP2.

God, I love those little codes.

FP1 and FP2—first and second free practice sessions. P3, P2—third place, second place. Clean. Efficient. Like the data I breathe.

Charles's feedback is precise, technical, and completely devoid of the heat that usually burns between us.

No teasing. No sideways glances. Just lap times, tire wear, corner entry speeds.

It's exactly what I wanted. It's also driving me insane.

I'm comparing telemetry data when a shadow falls across my screen. My first thought is Charles came back to actually communicate like a human being. My second thought is that I need therapy for how quickly hope blooms in my chest.

Neither thought prepares me for reality.

""Excuse me, are you Eva Farnese?""

I look up into the face that launched a thousand thirst tweets and probably inspired just as many daydreams.

Elio Black, standing in front of me in worn jeans and a fitted charcoal t-shirt that clings just right to a body sculpted by adrenaline and arrogance.

His dark hair is tousled in that effortless, I-just-stepped-off-a-yacht way, and his smile is a weapon of mass distraction. It’s the kind of grin that’s been scientifically engineered to melt inhibitions and separate women from their underwear with frightening efficiency.

And the worst part? He’s absolutely fucking aware of it.

""You shouldn't be here. This is a restricted area."" My voice comes out flatter than Charles's personality, which is an achievement.

His smile actually gets wider. The audacity!

""I got lost looking for the media center. But I'm glad I did. I've been hearing impressive things about Apex Nova's setup work.""

""I'm sure you have."" The sarcasm is thick enough to spread on toast.

This is the same guy who told Autosport Magazine that he dates models because ""they understand the lifestyle."" Bitch, please.

""Your aerodynamic package is brilliant. The way you've integrated the flow-vis paint data from Barcelona? Genius.""

Okay, so the pretty boy actually pays attention to technical details. I'm approximately 2% impressed.

""You've been analyzing our car?""

He steps closer, and I catch a whiff of his cologne—something that probably has a pretentious French name and comes in a crystal bottle.

""I analyze everything beautiful and dangerous. Cars, racing lines..."" His hazel eyes lock onto mine with practiced intensity. ""Talented mechanics who turn impossible dreams into reality.""

I actually snort. Out loud. Like a farm animal.

""Does that actually work on people?""

For a split second, his mask slips. Genuine surprise flickers across his features before he laughs—not the practiced chuckle from press conferences, but something fuller, more real.

""You're not impressed by the Elio Black charm offensive. Refreshing.""

""Listen, I've already seen your work. Sunday: mysterious brunette at the yacht party. Tuesday: that Netflix actress at the casino. Wednesday: someone's Swiss cousin at the sponsor dinner. You've got a tighter schedule than our pit stop strategies.""

His eyes light up with what looks suspiciously like delight. ""You've been keeping track?""

""The gossip sites' notifications assault my phone. It's like being subscribed to a reality show I never asked for.""

""Maybe I'm just looking for someone who sees through the bullshit,"" he says, and for a moment, there's something almost honest in his voice.

""Try a therapist. They're paid to deal with that kind of introspection.""

Before he can respond, the temperature drops ten degrees.

I don't need to look to know Charles is back, probably radiating possessive energy like a territorial cat.

""Nexus Racing drivers seem to get lost frequently,"" he said with a voice that could cut glass.

Elio's smile snaps back into place, but there's calculation behind it now. ""Just appreciating the craftsmanship. Your mechanic has impressive skills. And immunity to cheap flattery, apparently.""

The testosterone levels are approaching critical mass. I half expect them to start circling each other like sharks.

""Don't you have your own garage to contaminate, Black?"" Charles asks, stepping slightly between us. Subtle as a neon sign.

""I do. Thanks for the reminder."" Elio's eyes find mine again, and this time there's a challenge there. ""See you around, Eva. Maybe somewhere with better coffee and less... territorial behavior.""

He saunters off like he owns the paddock, which, given his father's net worth, might be partially true.

Charles rounds on me before Elio's even out of sight. ""What did he want?""

""To run his playboy routine on someone new, I assume. Does he think I haven't read the tabloids?""

I turn back to my data, dismissing both the interruption and Charles's weird energy.

""Black doesn't waste time on people who don't interest him."" His jaw is doing that thing where he's grinding his teeth. It's simultaneously concerning and attractive, which sums up my entire problem. ""Be careful around him.""

""Careful? The man's a walking red flag factory. I'm more likely to catch something from standing downwind of his cologne than fall for his act.""

Charles stares at me for a long moment, and there's something unreadable in his expression.

""You really aren't interested in him.""

""Why would I be? I prefer my mistakes homegrown and emotionally unavailable, apparently."" The words slip out before I can stop them, sharp and honest and entirely too revealing.

His face does something complicated—part wince, part want, part wall-building in real-time.

""Eva—""

""Data for FP3?"" I cut him off, pulling up fresh telemetry. ""Or are we done with the protective teammate routine?""

He hesitates, and for a second I think he might actually say something real.

Something about us, about this thing we're doing. About why he cares who flirts with me when he's made it crystal clear I'm just a convenient outlet.

""Focus on the setup. We need every tenth tomorrow.""

He walks away, leaving me with my laptop and the growing certainty that I'm playing a game where everyone knows the rules but me.

# hapter 3

Aug 7, 2025

Qualifying day in Monaco is like speed dating with death—fast, intense, and someone always ends up disappointed.

I'm running on three espressos and pure spite, finalizing Charles's setup while pretending his existence doesn't make my pulse do stupid things.

""Two clicks softer on the rear ARB,"" I tell the crew, not looking up from my data. ""He's overcooking it into Sainte Devote.""

""Okay, wait— Pause,"" says Nina, our new PR hire with glossy hair and a tablet full of sponsor logos.

She peers over my shoulder like I'm typing in runes.

""Did you just say... clicks? Rear... what now? Are we adjusting a spaceship?""

""Rear ARB—anti-roll bar,” I sigh, not unkindly. “It helps with how the car handles in corners. Two clicks softer means loosening it a little so the back end doesn’t slide out when Charles charges into Turn One like a medieval knight.""

""Got it.” Nina blinks. “Vaguely.""

I offer her a quick smile. ""Hang around long enough and you’ll start speaking fluent racers too. It’s contagious.""

Before she can respond, Charles materializes beside me like a well-dressed ghost.

""I need more front end through the swimming pool section.""

Of course he does.

""You need to trust the car.""

I make a minor adjustment, hyperaware of how he's standing exactly eighteen inches away.

We’ve become experts at this—communicating everything and nothing at once, every word carrying more weight than it should.

""I do trust the car.""

His voice drops half an octave, and I know he's not talking about the Apex Nova anymore.

I finally meet his eyes, and for a split second, the mask slips. Heat flares between us, many months of complicated situationship compressed into a single look.

Then Nicholas, Apex Nova second driver, walks by and Charles steps back like I'm radioactive.

""I'll need those changes before Q2,"" he says loudly, professionally, like I'm just another replaceable part in his championship machine.

Cool.

Love being treated like a glorified tire pressure gauge in public when privately he whispers my name like it's the answer to every question he's afraid to ask.

I grit my teeth and pretend the rising heat in my chest is just from the sun. Not humiliation or heartbreak.

I'm contemplating the therapeutic benefits of hitting things with wrenches when I spot a familiar figure lurking by our hospitality unit. Because apparently, Elio Black has decided to make annoying me his new hobby.

""Are you stalking me now?"" I abandon my workstation, marching over to where he's leaning against the wall like a GQ photo shoot waiting to happen.

His grin could power half of Monaco.

""I prefer 'strategic positioning.' Much more professional sounding.""

""And what's your strategy exactly?"" I cross my arms, giving him my best unimpressed face.

It's the same one I use on Charles when he's being particularly emotionally constipated and irritating me.

Something shifts in Elio's expression, the playboy mask cracking at the edges.

""Honestly? To figure out why you're the first woman in years who doesn't seem impressed by... this.""

He gestures to himself with a self-awareness I wasn't expecting.

""Maybe because I've seen your type before. All charm and headlines, but nothing substantial underneath."" The words come out harsher than intended, but I'm not in the mood to coddle millionaire egos today.

He actually looks thoughtful instead of offended. What is this, opposite day?

""You're probably right. But maybe that's because no one's ever made me want to be more substantial.""

The sincerity in his voice hits like a surprise chicane. I scramble for my defensive walls. ""That's a good line. Very convincing.""

Elio laughs, running a hand through his perfectly styled hair. ""You're not going to make this easy, are you?""

""Why should I? You've probably had everything handed to you your whole life.""

""Not everything."" His voice goes quiet, almost vulnerable. ""Not the things that actually matter.""

I'm saved from responding by Adison's voice cutting through the moment.

""Eva! Stop flirting with the rival and get your ass back here! Charles is having a meltdown about tire pressures.""

""I'm not flirting!"" I shout back, ignoring Elio's amused expression. ""And tell Weinberg if he doesn't trust my calculations, he can do them himself!""

""Weinberg?"" Elio's eyebrows climb toward his hairline. ""Not Charles? Interesting.""

""It's called professionalism. Look it up.""

""Is that what you call it?"" His tone suggests he sees right through my bullshit, which is alarming.

The last thing I need is F1's most eligible bachelor developing actual observation skills.

I retreat to the safety of my data, but I feel Elio's eyes on me as I go. It's different from Charles's gaze—less desperate heat, more curious intensity. Like I'm a particularly complex racing line he's trying to figure out.

I bury myself in telemetry and race simulations, trying to shake off the static left behind by both men. But distraction doesn’t last long—because soon, it’s qualifying.

\* \* \*

Qualifying is a masterclass in controlled chaos. Charles puts in a stunning lap, clinching pole with the kind of precision that makes my engineer heart sing and my stupid romantic heart ache.

Through the garage cameras, I watch him climb from the car, pulling off his helmet to reveal that focused intensity that first made me weak in the knees.

Our eyes meet across the garage chaos. For one unguarded second, his face breaks into a genuine smile—not for the cameras or the team, but for me.

Then Parker appears with media obligations, and Charles reconstructs his walls in real-time. The smile morphs into his standard victory expression, and I'm relegated back to furniture status.

Elio qualifies third, and I hate that I notice. Hate that I watch him onboard, admiring the fluid way he attacks the Monaco streets.

His driving style is the opposite of Charles's calculated precision—all instinct and natural flow, like he's dancing with the car instead of commanding it.

""He's good,"" Adison observes, appearing at my shoulder. ""Different from Charles, but good.""

""Since when do you analyze Nexus drivers?""

""Since they started analyzing you."" She gives me a knowing look. ""That wasn't a casual visit earlier.""

""It was nothing. He's probably working through his little black book alphabetically and got to 'E' for Eva.""

""Mhmm."" Adison's tone suggests she's not buying it. ""And Charles grinding his teeth during your entire conversation was also nothing?""

""Charles doesn't get to have opinions about who I talk to.""

The words taste bitter because we both know that's not how it works. Not when he's inside me one minute and pretending I don't exist the next.

I tell myself I don’t care. I lie to myself with practiced ease, the way he lies with silence.

By evening, I’m wrapped in a dress I barely chose and a mood I can’t shake. That evening's celebration at Le Grill feels like slow torture.

Charles sits directly across from me, close enough that I can smell him, far enough that we might as well be in different time zones.

He laughs at Parker's stories, charms the sponsors, plays the perfect pole-sitter while I pick at my overpriced fish and pretend my chest doesn't ache.

Nicholas, three drinks in and feeling chatty, starts hitting on our new marketing coordinator. Charles watches with thinly veiled disgust while I resist the urge to point out the hypocrisy.

At least Nicholas has the balls to flirt publicly.

""You okay?"" Adison whispers, catching me staring at Charles for the fifth time in ten minutes.

""Peachy. Living my best life. Thriving, actually.""

""Eva—""

""Did you know Monaco has the highest density of millionaires per square meter?"" I interrupt, desperate to change the subject. ""We're literally surrounded by rich assholes. It's like an infestation.""

Adison follows my gaze to where Charles is now talking to a sponsor's daughter, all polite attention and careful distance.

""Some infestations are harder to get rid of than others.""

Charles chooses that moment to glance my way, catching me looking at him. His expression darkens, jaw tightening in that familiar way.

For someone who insists we're nothing, he does a spectacular boyfriend impression.

I’m in my 40s and looking to meet new people around Galway for casual meetups, coffee, pints, walks, or whatever.

I've realized that my friends circle has shrunk in the last few years and it's time to widen my circle. 
As I said, I'm an early 40s lad, I checked out meet up and many of those groups seem to cater to a younger demographic. So I thought I'd ask on here since this is a lively community on here. 

I'm pretty certain there are many in my age range noticing the shrinkage in friends circles due to marriage, kids and all that. For me COVID accelerated it.

**Yo Ho, Yo Ho, it’s a pirate’s life for us…**

Hello, chums.

The only rules that matter are these: what a crew *can* do, and what a crew *can’t* do.     
For instance—you *can* accept that this club is a pack of scallywags, limping near the bottom of the table in desperate need of a W… or you *can’t*.     
But pillaging is in our blood, and one day you’ll remember that we’ve done it before… so we can certainly do it again.

Now, the YASSS Queen and I *could* stay ashore, keep our boots dry, and spare ourselves the trouble.     
But then we’d miss the sweet burn of victory rum when the inevitable plunder comes.

So the question is this:     
Can we sail south like a band of marauders and return with our hold heavy with stolen points…  
…or can we not.

**Match Hype**:

You're Ol' Pal Shlomo here, checking in as usual. Woke up this morning feeling hopeful and made the climb up the Mountain Top of Hype to see our YASSS QUEEN before we packed up for that short but arduous voyage to San Diego… I said what I said.

When I reached the summit, what did I find? A slumbering YASSS QUEEN. We were about to run late, so I lobbed her a fresh cup of coffee, figuring caffeine by osmosis might do the trick.

""*CURSE YOU FOR BREATHING, YOU SLACK-JAWED IDIOT!*"" she roared as she came to. Honestly, I probably deserved worse.

Once she’d cleaned the coffee off herself and actually drank some, she had this to say:

""For an organization obsessed with legacy, we sure fixate on wins and points. Not all treasure is silver and gold ya know.     
For too long we’ve been parched for victory, unable to quench it with wins. Too long have we starved for goals — with not enough triumph, with poor consistency, and no warmth from dominance.     
The moonlight on enemy shores will show us who we really are.     
Sailing down south, it’s time once again to remind everyone: take what you can and give nothing back.""

Take a walk, Sol Rosa fam… **VOLEMOS!**

I hope you've all been properly hyped

1mlv4l7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mlv4l7/is_this_sexual_abuse/,Is this sexual abuse?,"When I was younger and still a virgin, I was in a relationship with a guy who pressured me into sex even though I wasn’t ready and very scared of it. I had a medical condition that made sex painful, and I told him this many times. He said I needed to be “broken in” so I wouldn’t feel the pain anymore.

He was very good at making it seem like he cared about what I was going through, but the pressure was constant and confusing. He once said, “If the specialty coffee shop is closed,” basically meaning me because he thought I was very beautiful, “then you should go to the one that is cheaper but open.” In other words, if I wasn’t ready for sex, he could just find another “uglier girl” (in his own words) who was.

Even though he kept saying, “I don’t want you to do this if you’re not ready,” the way he acted didn’t match his words. He pushed for sex and certain acts like backdoor sex, even when I said no. Sometimes during sex, he would “accidentally” put it somewhere I didn’t want even though I would say before the act I don’t feel like doing backdoor sex and keep going while I froze. When I would tell him to stop or be upset he would get angry and say “why didnt you say no, then?” completely ignoring that I said no before. But these “accidents” of putting it in the wrong hole would happen almost everytime and sometimes he would even laugh about it when I would be shocked that he would go somewhere else as if it was some kind of joke.

He converted to islam. Once during my period, he said vaginal sex was “haram” because of his religion and said we should try backdoor sex and lied about his spiritual coach saying backdoor sex is okay just so he could do it. When I found out he was lying and manipulating me I started crying very very hard. 

Now that I’m older, I’m trying to understand if this counts as sexual abuse or coercion. Was I being pressured beyond consent? Or am I misreading what happened? I would appreciate any insight as I want to talk about this with my therapist and need some other point of views.",1,1754760611.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

Because she is so good at masking the (lack of) emotions she is feeling. And of course, you want to maintain the idea that ""your family is different"", ""narcissistic abuse is something that happens... but not to me"". But that feeling that you've always had of having something missing? You did. You are missing out on the emotional connection with your mother - because she is incapable of it. She might pretend it's there - whilst uncomfortably sat opposite each other at a coffee shop, or in a forceable hug after a disagreement - but it's all surface level. The emotional validation that you so deeply need is simply not available to her. And it still affects you to this day; it's the emotional wall you put up when talking to people, the voice in the back of your head when you're at work saying that you're going to get fired when you know you've done nothing wrong. It's deep rooted within your mind.

And I just feel so much guilt - because I put myself in her position, and think about how that would make ME feel. But I know that it's pointless because she doesn't have that kind of empathy within her.

I think I'm just here looking for a bit of community - I'm so overwhelmed having made this realisation. I am (as I'm sure many others are) still somewhat financially dependent on my parents. I have had to move back in with them after struggling to find work in a difficult job market, and whilst in the throws of my mental health. So I feel like I can't have the emotional disconnect that I need in order to heal. I feed on their energies - I can feel it permeating through the floors of the house. The harsh dismissive undertones, accusatory footsteps, and slamming doors. They all take me back to 5 year old me - the little girl who just needed someone to tell her that what she is feeling is okay. That she is normal. That she doesn't need fixing. She is enough.",6,1754760466.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,0.88,False
1mlv270,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mlv270/my_phone_records_a_conversation_every_night_that/,My phone records a conversation every night that i never had,"A few weeks ago, I found out by accident that my phone sometimes saves short audio clips when it thinks I’m talking to it. The files are only a few seconds long and buried deep in the settings.

At first, they were harmless. Once, I mumbled in my sleep: “Where’s my charger?” Another time it was just a cough. I laughed and figured it was just normal sleep talking.

Then, one Thursday, there was another file. 3:12 a.m.
I hit play and heard my own voice say:
“Is he awake?”

A short pause.

Then a second voice: “No. Not yet.”

I live alone.

My voice sounded slower, flatter. The other was deeper, rougher. I couldn’t place it.

The next evening, I met up with two people I sometimes grab drinks with. We sat in a small bar, talking about work and stress. At some point, I mentioned the recording, like it was just a weird story. One of them immediately said I probably just talk to myself in my sleep. The other said maybe I could hear my neighbors through the walls. They both laughed. I laughed too, but inside, I had the feeling they didn’t really believe me.

Night 2: Friday, 2:47 a.m. – next recording:
“Soon.”
My voice. I was sure of it. No memory of saying it.

On Saturday, I stayed out most of the day to clear my head. Shopping, coffee in the park. I tried convincing myself everything was normal. That night, I put my phone in the living room, turned on airplane mode.

Night 3: Sunday morning, there was still a new file. 4:03 a.m.
Slow footsteps. Then my whisper: “He’s listening.”
Then absolute silence.

At work, I noticed my concentration slipping. I work in a small warehouse. Usually, it’s all routine, but I kept zoning out. A coworker asked if I was getting sick. I shook my head.

Night 4: Monday, 3:55 a.m. – two voices, both sounding like me:
“When?”
“Tonight.”
Then a dull thud, like someone had moved the phone.

On Tuesday, I started checking for changes in my apartment. I found a glass on the wrong side of the table, a sweater draped over a chair that I’d left in the closet, my screwdriver lying in the middle of the hallway. I stood there staring at it for minutes, as if it might explain itself.

Night 5: Tuesday – recording:
“He’s almost ready.”
“Soon he’ll remember.”

Wednesday morning, I had a thin scratch on my forearm. Not deep, but fresh. I had no idea how it got there. That evening, I went out to grab groceries and caught myself scanning people on the street, like I was checking if they recognized me.

Night 6: Thursday – no greeting, no whisper. Just one sentence:
“We know what you did.”
Pause.
“You’ll play your part.”

By Friday, I felt numb. I only realized at lunch that I hadn’t eaten the breakfast I’d brought. While working, I noticed a small dried stain on my pants – dark brown. I rubbed at it, but it didn’t fully come out.

Night 7: Friday –
“Tonight you’ll finish it.”
“You know what to do.”
Then a long, soft sound, like something heavy being dragged across the floor.

On Saturday, someone I used to hang out with called. We talked briefly before he said I should come out again sometime. I told him I was busy. After hanging up, I realized I’d lied  I had nothing to do.

Night 8: Saturday –
The recording started with no background noise.
One voice: “It’s time.”
My voice, quiet: “I know.”
A short pause.
“You’re ready now.”
Then a single, slow step and the recording ended.

That Saturday night, I sat on the couch for hours, staring at the dark TV screen until my own reflection barely looked like me anymore. Then I picked up my phone and slammed it on the floor until the screen shattered. Pulled the battery, put everything in a bag, straight into the trash. I thought it was over.

Last night, I woke up. No idea what time. No phone. No clock. Just that musty smell of damp concrete and metal.

I was standing. Barefoot. The floor cold under my feet.
In front of me was a workbench. On it, my box cutter, my hammer, zip ties – all lined up neatly. It was definitely my tools.

The air was thick and heavy. Somewhere, water was dripping. A lamp on the ceiling flickered, throwing restless shadows against the walls.

And then I noticed:
My right hand was wet. Not completely just the handle of the knife.

I don’t know how I got out of there.
Or if I even want to know.

1mlv26f,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticWithADHD/comments/1mlv26f/how_to_think_about_defectiveness_a_lesson_from_a/,how to think about defectiveness - a lesson from a life of thrift,"Hi friends!

I have always struggled with deep feelings of defectiveness, and those get tied up with feelings around difference, disability, and worst of all, self-worth. I've struggled with affirmations. They feel hard to say or share and not specific to me. Today I had an epiphany to help in this area and wanted to share:

""I am the treasure I'd love to find at a thrift store.""

If you're shopping at a big box retailer, a defect is a bad thing. It means the already cheap, yet somehow overpriced crap, isn't even good enough. It's a reject. A letdown. Sometimes it can't even do the thing it was supposed to do, like a coffee maker with a broken power button. That's the sort of perspective I want to get away from. 

I shop at thrift stores and vintage markets, too. And like all thrift-store lovers, what I want is to stumble onto a treasure that feels special and uniquely appealing to me. So if that's what I'm looking for, I am also *looking for defects*. I've sold used furniture for a long time. I know that the brand new Ikea build it yourself thing with 0 scratches or defects is worth a tiny fraction of a mid-century, solid wood desk that's got some dings and wear and tear. In fact, particle board doesn't even wear how real wood does, because particle board is *all surface, no substance*. So if I want something of high value for a low price, *I go looking for the defects*. And when I find the scratched surface and some missing veneer, I see good bones. The defects are a sign of quality and give it history. It makes the piece unique.

So for once I'll use some language of capitalism to reinforce something positive. If you are a 'product,' are you one that's sold at Target or at Goodwill? If you're 'gently used' but have deep quality and substance, too, don't go looking for pretty packaging to know if you're good - look for the dings and wear, see how you came through them, and realize that those are indicators of something worthy. 

""I am something I would love to stumble across in a thrift store."" There's my first real affirmation. Thanks for reading.

But I can name at least one good thing I got out of being there. It might sound silly or trivial, but I think it was finding out I like Dunken Donut's hot chocolate. They also made a white hot chocolate that I found out I liked as well.

I know it sounds a little odd, but if it weren't for the church's ban on coffee or tea, I may never have thought to try their hot chocolate. I remember getting a white hot chocolate and trying it while having my talks with the sister missionaries. One in particular who was really faithful to her beliefs especially appreciated it because regular chocolate made her sick, though I can't remember the details why because it was so long ago.

I'm not sure what my takeaway with this is, but sometimes it helps to think well maybe there was something good that came out of this mess. We all walked away with emotional trauma, but thinking of a little positive helps me cope with it.

On the tenth year of my marriage to Jadiel Gibson, my son struck me on the head with a trophy because Jadiel's first love didn't show up at the ceremony.

""Get lost! It's your fault Kelly couldn't be here!
""You're nothing but a manipulator using underhanded tactics. I can't imagine how many people you've tricked with those dirty schemes!
""Having you as my mother is my greatest shame!""

I stared at my son—his eyes filled with hatred, like he truly wished I were dead—and gave a bitter smile.
The trophy made a sharp noise when it collided with my head, leaving everyone in the lounge shocked.
But Oliver Gibson, my 12-year-old son, didn't even try to wipe the blood splattered on his face.
A sharp pain pierced the back of my head, yet I remained calm.
Maybe because I'd already gotten used to his violence.
The teacher trembled and took the weapon away.
""Oliver! This is your mother!""
Oliver didn't bother to look my way as I lay on the ground. With a chilly tone, he said, ""She doesn't deserve to be my mom!""
I rested against the teacher, my breaths shallow.
Still, I clenched my fists, my nails digging into my palm.
With a hint of irony in my voice, I quietly replied, ""That's right. I'm not his mom.""
Just as Oliver was about to leave, he stopped abruptly. This sudden pause was even more frightening than when he'd struck me earlier.
With a swift motion, he knocked the glass figurine off the table, and it shattered on the floor.
The sound of breaking glass was followed by the slam of the door as he walked out.
I ignored Oliver, my gaze fixed on the pieces of glass strewn across the floor.
I spent three months crafting that graduation gift, testing over a hundred furnaces in the process.
It was the closest resemblance to Oliver.
This morning, I presented it to Oliver, hoping it would make him smile.
However, Oliver showed no interest. He continued to grumble about my insistence on attending the ceremony.
His comment had caused his beloved, Kelly Meane, to avoid visiting due to her suspicions.
I swallowed my bitterness, determined not to cry on his big day.
Suddenly, the sharp base of the trophy struck my head.
As I began to lose consciousness, a young girl rushed over.
She looked at me with disdain as I lay helpless on the floor.
""Quit pretending, homewrecker. Oliver said he was just giving you a lesson. He didn't even use much force.""
The teacher was taken aback and tried to scold her for being rude.
She pouted and looked at me with disdain.
""Oliver shared the surveillance video of that awful woman drugging his father in the group!
""My mom said that those who ruin other people's relationships are homewreckers!""
The child's blunt words pierced my heart like a sharp knife, leaving me breathless.
It felt as if my blood turned to ice in that instant.
That night, it was obvious that Kelly wanted to be with Jadiel.
I ended up sleeping next to Jadiel.
But when morning came, I was accused of drugging someone to advance myself.
Jadiel discovered the actual surveillance footage.
However, to protect Kelly, he created a fake video instead.
He directed all his fury toward me.
I used to believe that the injustices I endured due to Kelly were already overwhelming.
Yet now, even the child I carried for ten months and brought into this world despises me because of this.
The teacher assisted me in calling an ambulance.
As soon as it arrived, Oliver unexpectedly dashed over.
Without giving anyone a chance to respond, he pulled me off the stretcher.
My head struck the ground once more, and waves of sharp pain and dizziness overwhelmed my senses.
Yet, this physical agony was nothing compared to the emotional wound inflicted by the person I trusted most in the world.
""Quit acting! You're not dying. You just want to sabotage my graduation, don't you?""
The crowd was stunned by Oliver's heartlessness.
Yet, I lay there serenely, unaffected.
The teacher stepped in sharply. “No matter what happened, she brought you into this world! If she passes away, you'll never have a mother again!""
Oliver felt annoyed by the teacher's words.
He kicked me forcefully and yelled, ""She's been a scourge for thousands of years! It would be wonderful if she could truly die!
""If I get labeled as bad because of you today, I'll make sure to 'kill' you ten more times!""

Chapter 2

 A blow struck my chest.
 The sound of my ribs cracking was audible to everyone nearby.
 A sharp pain surged through me, and as I opened my mouth, a spurt of blood splattered onto him.
 Oliver recoiled quickly, his face twisted in a strange expression.
 The nurse seized the moment to move him aside and quickly lifted me back into the ambulance.
 However, as we reached the emergency room entrance, Jadiel's assistant halted us.
 The assistant, visibly uneasy at the sight of me drenched in blood, hesitated before speaking.
 Nevertheless, he mustered up the nerve to deliver the message. ""Mr. Gibson requests that you be reasonable and go back to apologize to Mr. Oliver.
 ""He plans to join Ms. Meane for the necklace shoot today and prefers not to be interrupted.""
 The doctor bellowed, ""What kind of person prioritizes buying a necklace over a human life? We need to save the patient right away! Find someone who can sign the consent form immediately!""
 I lay there with my eyes shut, and the subtle movement of my chest was the only sign that I was still alive.
 With trembling hands, the assistant started a video call.
 ""Mr. Gibson, you should take a look at Mrs. Gibson's condition yourself.""
 Jadiel was stunned when he saw me.
 He hadn't anticipated that Oliver would strike his own mother with such force.
 He exhaled quietly.
 ""Oliver has definitely crossed the line this time.""
 As the words disappeared, a slender figure suddenly leaped into his embrace.
 Right after, Kelly's upbeat voice chimed in.
 ""Are you on a video call with Oliver?""
 She struggled to stand, and Jadiel instinctively wrapped his arm around her waist for support.
 Even though he knew I couldn't wake up, the assistant guiltily adjusted the screen angle a bit.
 Kelly gasped in shock and pressed her face against Jadiel's neck in fright.
 ""Oh my goodness! How did she get injured so severely?""
 Jadiel explained it was due to an altercation with Oliver.
 Her face immediately took on a strange expression, and she asked, ""Oliver is just a kid. How could he have hurt Pamela like this?
 ""Pamela, you're upset that Jadiel went to the auction with me. So, you're pretending, aren't you?""
 Her voice went high, clearly implying she thought I was faking it.
 The doctor lost patience and shouted, ""Who would pretend when their life is at stake?""
 Jadiel's expression immediately turned icy upon hearing this.
 ""Most people wouldn't, but Pamela is quite adept at it!""
 He ended the call and finally let the doctor treat me.
 A single message came through.
 ""If you cause any delay for Kelly to bid on the necklace, I'll ensure your life becomes a nightmare!""
 It's no surprise they're father and son—their threatening styles are identical.
 Once upon a time, Jadiel had chosen me without a second thought.
 He returned to the master bedroom, sometimes cooked meals, and even planned a trip with me, despite my lack of travel experience.
 After spending nights together, he'd hold me close and speak in a deep voice.
 ""Pamela, I want to make things right with you. Let's have a destination wedding!""
 I believed he would move on from the past and make a fresh start with me.
 It wasn't until Kelly and I were abducted together that I understood Jadiel had merely concealed Kelly more deeply within his heart.
 At that time, Jadiel had intended to sever all connections with Kelly.
 When the kidnappers demanded he pick between us, he chose to rescue me for the first time.
 But in a fit of rage, a devastated Kelly leaped off a cliff.
 Jadiel remained at the base of the cliff for three days.
 It wasn't until the kidnappers, unable to handle the intense questioning, accused me of orchestrating the entire scheme.
 In a fit of rage, he slapped me repeatedly right in front of Kelly's grave.
 ""I can't believe I fell for your act of innocence! I even considered building a life with you!
 ""You murdered Kelly! I want you to join her in the grave!""
 But then, everything changed.

Chapter 3

The doctor narrowly saved my life, but my time is limited.
""Multiple organ failure...""
Jadiel, who had rushed back, rubbed his forehead, frowning deeply.
""Pamela Harlan, I intended to forgive you after Oliver graduated.""
He gazed down at me, as though granting forgiveness was an enormous favor.
""Did you really have to cause such a scene today?
""If it weren't for Kelly persuading me to return, I wouldn't have cared if you survived or not this time!
""You're well aware you weren't in any real danger. Are you using this martyr routine to make everyone fault Oliver and put me in a difficult spot?""
Kelly gently patted his shoulder, a tender expression on her face, while Oliver held his waist tightly.
They stood beside my hospital bed, resembling a close-knit family of three.
I gazed at him, feeling a sudden clarity.
Jadiel's hatred wasn't solely due to my interference with him and Kelly.
To him, all my years of patience and admiration were merely deceitful acts.
Even when we were intimate and he seemed completely absorbed, he would always take an extended bath afterward.
He believed I had resorted to vile tactics to entice many others.
He despised me.
Every word he said felt like a dagger to the heart.
Tears that couldn't escape clogged my throat, almost suffocating me.
Noticing my silence, Jadiel's face became increasingly tense.
""Are you still questioning my relationship with Kelly?
""She's been having issues with Eric Hachett recently, and they're going through a divorce. I'm just there for her as a friend to offer support!""
Kelly's face momentarily stiffened, then she added.
""Jadiel has been honest with me. He did have feelings for me in the past.
""But now that Oliver has grown up, Jadiel has always expressed his desire to be a good father.
""As Oliver's mother, you can be sure he'll treat you kindly.
""Therefore, Pamela, you really need to stop doubting us.
""Constant suspicion really hurts Jadiel's feelings.""
Kelly's words sounded explanatory, but each one was meant to show she was closer to Jadiel than I ever was.
Unexpectedly, I chuckled.
Jadiel assumed I was warming up. He extended his hand, attempting to tuck a stray hair behind my ear.
""Don't dwell on it too much. Let's enjoy life from now on.""
In the past, I would have been moved by the unexpected warmth in his actions, hoping that someday he might understand my real emotions.
Now, I looked away from him in disdain.
Jadiel's hand halted in mid-motion.
Then he saw the fast pulse on the ECG monitor next to me, and his smug smile returned.
""Don't stay mad at Oliver. Remember, he's your child.""
Hearing that, Oliver tucked himself behind Kelly, purposefully avoiding eye contact with me.
""I want Kelly to be my mom instead!""
Kelly gave him a reassuring pat on the back, a helpless smile playing on her lips.
Her eyes fixed on me with a hint of challenge.
I replied casually, ""That's fine.""
Those simple words caused Jadiel and Oliver's expressions to shift suddenly.
Oliver's eyes turned red with anger.
""Oliver!""
Jadiel intercepted his hand before it could descend.
Looking at me with disapproval, Jadiel questioned, ""What kind of upbringing did you give him? He's so aggressive at such a young age!""
Furious at his attempt to deflect responsibility, I couldn't help but laugh out loud.
""Wasn't it you, his own father, who disregarded my life from the start?""
My typical patience and humility vanished, leaving Jadiel shocked.
Even Oliver was caught off guard by my response to Jadiel. In his confusion, he exclaimed without thinking, ""Have you died so many times your brain's scrambled?
""Aside from Dad and me, who else in this world would want you?""
At that time, Jadiel didn't want this child, but Kelly was completely content with the situation.
After all, having Jadiel's child would guarantee my place as ""Mrs. Gibson.""
Jadiel would despise me even more, and stay even more devoted to her.
I was even more reluctant than him to give birth to this child, conceived through coercion.
But my desires were never considered.
Despite yielding, I never gained their genuine respect.
Instead, I became someone they could easily exploit.
The lucky charm I had hoped would safeguard Oliver since he was born. He shattered it himself.
Well, let it be. This obligatory mother-son connection stopped then.
I was free of any remaining ties.

Chapter 4

 Fighting back the stinging in my nose, I took a deep breath.
 ""Oliver, you hate me for giving birth to you without your consent and for not being the mother you hoped for.
 ""Do you think I wanted this?""
 He opened his mouth, but had no idea what to say.
 ""But from now on, you won't have to feel annoyed anymore.""
 My voice was soft, yet I poured every bit of strength into it.
 I then turned to Jadiel, enunciating each word with earnestness.
 ""If there's a next life, I never want to see you again.""
 Jadiel seemed stung by my gaze, flustered, lowering his eyes.
 Tears finally slid down my cheeks, and the ECG monitor let out a shrill alarm.
 Jadiel felt a deep emptiness in his heart, as though he had lost something important.
 When the medical team hurried in to rescue me, Jadiel gripped my icy hand firmly.
 Standing at the ward's entrance with Oliver, Kelly gently urged him, ""Jadiel, step out quickly so the doctors can examine her thoroughly.
 ""Pamela pulls this martyr stunt every time. She's not even afraid that something truly terrible might actually happen someday.""
 As she spoke, Oliver's fists unclenched.
 ""Hmph! You're always using those cheap tricks!""
 He dashed over, grabbed Jadiel's hand, and led him out of the room.
 ""Dad, don't let them fool you!""
 Jadiel's despair faded, replaced by anger at being fooled.
 He looked on with a cold stare as the doctors continuously pressed the defibrillator against my chest.
 ""I won't fall for it again!""
 Then he turned around, picked up his son, and walked away.
 Before departing, he made a point of loudly inviting Kelly to join them for dinner at home.
 My mind started to fade, and the world around me fell silent.
 I didn't know how much time had passed.
 A voice I hadn't heard in almost a decade suddenly rang out loudly in my ear.
 ""There's a heartbeat!
 ""Pamela! It's Adam! Wake up now!""

 ***
 At Gibson's manor.
 Jadiel sat motionless on the couch for more than two hours.
 In that period, the hospital called once.
 Upon hearing the name ""Pamela,"" Jadiel promptly ended the call. Later, he just switched off his phone.
 At dinner, he ate mindlessly until a sharp pain pierced his stomach.
 ""Did you add black pepper to this?""
 Kelly appeared puzzled. ""Yes, I got it just for this. It tastes better with it.""
 Jadiel was sweating heavily from the discomfort. He let out a dry laugh. ""I told you back in high school that black pepper upsets my stomach.""
 Kelly responded with annoyance. ""It's been ages. I clearly forgot!
 ""Are you blaming me, Jadiel?""
 Jadiel said nothing.
 Indeed, she was Kelly, the woman he had spent half his life chasing after.
 He would only treasure and safeguard her. How could he ever hold her accountable?
 It was Pamela who always remembered his dietary restrictions and preferences.
 Yet today, she had to have an outburst, and now she remained in the hospital.
 Jadiel rubbed his stomach, feeling a bit frustrated that Pamela still hadn't returned.
 He headed to the medicine cabinet to look for painkillers but came up empty-handed.
 At that moment, Oliver approached and retrieved more than a dozen boxes from beneath the coffee table.
 Jadiel frowned and asked, ""Why did you hide the medicine here?""
 Oliver fidgeted with his fingers and whispered softly, ""The mean lady mentioned that her body has been in increasing pain.
 ""I didn't want her interfering with me, so I hid all of her medicine.""
 Jadiel's pupils shrank sharply, and his entire body shook with emotion.
 ""Oliver! How can you behave this way toward your mother?""
 In that moment, Jadiel remembered the earlier scene where doctors were desperately trying to revive me.
 A foreboding feeling settled in his chest.
 He hurriedly turned on his phone, and a text message appeared right away.
 ""Pamela was pronounced dead following unsuccessful resuscitation efforts at 2:00 p.m. today. Please come to the hospital promptly to claim the body.""
 Jadiel felt a heavy thump in his chest, and his vision swam with dizziness.
 Oliver exclaimed, ""No way! That can't be true!""

AI's Fashion Revolution: Couture's Brave New World or the Tech-Deck Swashbuckle?""","Ohoy there, fashionistas, technophiles, and all ye digital dread pirates of the style sea! Let's unfurl the sails and set course for the shimmering horizon where AI and fashion collide like an embellished corset meets a leather trench coat!

- First on the catwalk, patterns! Not the kind your Nana knits, unless she's coding algorithms on the side. AI is revolutionizing the way patterns and textures are conceived. Gone are the days of mood boards and fabric swatches. These avant-garde algorithms are dishing out designs faster than a supermodel changes for quick-fire runway shows!

Imagine an AI spotting that leopard prints are the old rage (blasphemy, I know) before you've even had your first cup of coffee. These AI trendsetters analyze social media, runway shows, and even deep-sea squids (maybe not that last one) to predict what's making waves next season.

- Personalization is akin to finding treasure on a deserted island. An oasis of ""You""-ness in a sea of off-the-rack conformity. AI is like that mystical compass pointing to bespoke garments so exquisitely tailored to your body and style, you'd think the threads were spun from your very essence!
  
- Sustainability! No buried wastefulness here, siree! AI helps find the most eco-friendly materials and optimizes production to reduce waste. It's like having a first mate who not only swabs the decks but recycles the seawater whilst doing so!

- Virtual dressing rooms - Because who hasn't dreamt of trying on a pirate hat from the comfort of their own cabin? With AI, you can virtually swashbuckle into new outfits. Less time plunderin’ the malls, more time enjoying the spoils!

- And the forecasting, mateys! AI's not just for predicting stormy weathers but stormy fashion faux pas too! This predictive prowess helps businesses stock just what will sell, reducing the dreaded fashion flotsam cluttering our uncharted wardrobe waters.

Now, lest ye think this ship offers only smooth sailing, consider that every Silver has its Flint. The integration of AI in fashion beckons queries on originality and the ethics of data plundering. Yet, this new frontier teases with an allure as irresistible as a siren's call.

As we stand on the crow's nest of innovation, one has to ponder, will AI become the new couturier or simply a high-tech cabin boy? Will it perpetually alter the fashion tides, or will it make a splash before sinking like a stone in port?

Let's converse in the comments, savvy? Do ye embrace this brave new world with a hearty ""Arrr"", or will ye be walkin' the plank, clinging to tradition as your only ally in fashion's vast ocean? ⚓👗🤖",1,1754760199.0,FashionFuture,0,1.0,False
1mluynq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1mluynq/meeting_half_way/,Meeting half way,"I'm getting on well with a girl on bumble and we are planning a first date however I'm facing a bit of a tricky situation regarding location for the date.

It seems that she would like to meet close to her home. She hasn't explicitly said this yet but keeps rejecting my suggestions without indicating her preference.

We live in cities just over an hour apart. 

I suggested a town about 15 mins on the train for her and about 45 mins drive for myself. You might think why not just make the final strecth into the city myself. This is because the journey into this particular city centre can be a nightmare, with heavy traffic and trying to find parking which is usually a long walk into the city. Meeting just a little bit outside the city saves a huge amount of hassle. As shown by travel times, I'm still more than happy to do the longer journey, half an hour longer.

I always used to be happy to travel to her for the first date but I've been thinking and my position has changed for a couple of reasons.

1.Where there is a disparity in the level of commitment, it can result in different levels of effort. 

Within the last month I've been on 2 dates where the girl had about 5 mins to walk and I travelled over an hour. One of them cancelled with only 20 mins notice despite the fact I had just parked and was walking to the location. The second girl ended up ghosting afterwards. 

Cancelling just 20 mins before probably seemed like nothing as she had a 5 mins walk, yet I had to leave work early and travel in heavy traffic for over an hour. Likewise, ghosting afterwards might not have seemed bad as she didn't invest much effort, yet it was hurtful from my perspective as I had taken a lot of time out. Meeting half way, or as my latest suggestion, only 1/4 of the way, indicates a bit more commitment. 

2.The other thing it shows is a fundamental part of a relationship - compromise. Meeting in a location that works for both people shows a degree of mutual respect for each other.

Compromise sets a better precedent. We could meet in the middle first time. Then if we want to meet again, I could go to her second time, she could visit me the third time and meet in the middle again the fourth time. It's a bit of give and take.

I understand that safety might be an issue and I recognise that. Firstly, I suggested somewhere she is still familiar with as it's only 15 mins on the train. Secondly, I always suggest a public place like a bar, restaurant, coffee shop etc. 

Is it unreasonable to compromise on location, especially since it's clear that I would be excessively put out if there is not a slight compromise on her side?",1,1754760188.0,Bumble,5,1.0,False

1mluxb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOptimism/comments/1mluxb4/optimistic_take_on_those_whove_had_their_faces/,Optimistic Take On Those Who've Had Their Faces Eaten By Leopards,"First, I need to admit something..

I love reading r/LeopardsAteMyFace  because for a minute it genuinely soothes my anxiety to know that people are experiencing consequences before I quickly realize how much I hate that it's come to this. The only reason that I do is that I want to see if there is a theme, the language that people use in their frustrations, declarations, etc.. I want to see their reaction.

*As a minor, secondary optimistic take in response to most top comments in that sub saying, ""and yet they're still going to vote republican"": I highly doubt they will actually ever vote again. The entire Trump fandom to me seems to be like ""eh, it was fun until it effected me so now I've lost interest you can have your government back, I'm over it"".*

It's mainly because I want to believe that when someone gets hit with something they never thought would affect them, how they react says a lot, especially the words they use or the lessons they draw. A lot of people aren’t actually bad at heart but they were just misinformed or straight-up tricked by people who knew how to manipulate their emotions. Some people may view that as me trying to cope with my MAGA parents, but they really are kind people when you speak with them, but **THEY WERE TRICKED** into thinking that people like me hate them. That I think that they are racist because they don't understand complex institutional racism, or they're mouth-breathing idiots because they don't have a college degree, and I would think, ""What? Who is telling you this stuff?!""

I realized that I was getting angry at people who were tricked. I met continued ignorance, with continued frustration, which inevitably led to each party digging their heels in because both **BELIEVED** that they were right. I don't claim to know everything and would never say that, but it was the unwillingness to listen that was infuriating.

Then I realized that I was the one who wasn't listening..

Didn't think that I needed to because after all, I was the one who was **RIGHT,** right?

Well how did I know I was right? I had **TONS** and **TONS** of information, and facts, a logic on my side to prove it!! I'm college educated, I have an innate curiosity and love learning. I slowly realized though, not everyone was like me however, so the next question was then:

Why would I assume that they had the same information as I did? Would they draw the same conclusions as me if they **DID?** That answer was a ""probably"" and that was good enough for me, for now.

So in that case, let **ME** try to be the one to understand where they are coming from. Meet them where they're at. I don't care about defending my positions or educating; just listening objective to completely understand their thought process.

I learned their underlying beliefs follow incredibly simple, but flawed logic. All of their beliefs make sense on the surface, but that's where it ends:

**""If you work hard, you’ll succeed""**

\-They BELIEVE (again, not about if rightfully or wrongfully for this purpose) that they worked hard and that they put in the effort, and that anyone else who doesn't simply isn't trying. If you tell them it's ""not that easy"", they begin to feel like you're invalidating their hard work. Also, thinking the world is ""fair"" and rewards effort is comforting, and motivating.

**“Raising the minimum wage will kill small businesses""**

\-They BELIEVE they just want to keep the little coffee shop in town open. If wages go way up, they won’t survive. It's worry about losing local businesses and the community feel, and the fear that changes will hurt the people and places they care about

**""Welfare makes people lazy""**

They BELIEVE they work hard to support their family, so it’s frustrating to BELIEVE that some people get paid to do nothing. Again, it makes sense to feel frustrated when you’re working hard and want to see that effort respected. Wanting everyone to pull their weight comes from that strong sense of fairness.

**“All immigrants are criminals or take our jobs”**

\-They BELIEVE they need to worry about their family’s safety and whether there’ll be enough work to go around. More worry about safety, economic stability, and protecting one’s family and livelihood.

Now, thinking about it longer and more critically obviously reveals the flaws in their logic and why these beliefs are simply wrong, but what I see are some decent people, who BELIEVE they are doing what's best for themselves, their families, and communities, but it's counter-productive because the far-right successfully gives them an **OTHER** as an out to be mad at, while a faction on the left make them feel like they are  irredeemably bad people for holding these beliefs, which I just demonstrated at their core, are very fear based and HUMAN.

If you keep that in mind, it’s easier to stay mindful and empathetic. Instead of making them feel dumb for what they used to believe, maybe we can welcome them in, share new info gently, and help them grow in a way that sticks? If they seem genuinely sorry, they deserve some positive regard I believe, because it has to start somewhere, right?..

It has to..

This mindfulness and empathy is for **YOU** and **YOUR WELLNESS**. By practicing empathy, you are not condoning or agreeing with their actions or beliefs, you are simply recognizing that their beliefs are a result of ignorance, and a well funded and coordinated indoctrination effort that manipulates peoples emotions for their own personal gain, because emotions feel more **REAL, MORE THREATENING** than logic. I can **FEEL** my emotions, but I can' feel my thinking. It makes it very difficult to ignore that emotion, and it takes discipline to think logically.

Now, I'm not talking about the tried and true, dyed-in-the-wool hateful, bigot, fascist, xenophobic, wears-their-far-right-beliefs-with-cowardly-pride, Nazi's those people are far gone.

Fuck 'em

There's a societal issue at play there, and something deeper that right now, isn't your problem. Let's compartmentalize and put that problem on the back burner because right now you have ONE JOB.

Talk to that one person in your life who voted MAGA who you know isn't an outright terrible person. The person who has plenty of redeemable qualities. The person who you still sort of talk to who you just absolutely want to rub it in their faces and scream and say ""SEE, I TOLD YOU SO!! WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU THINK WAS GOING TO HAPPEN?!?!""

To reiterate, I'm not talking about hateful, stormfront, proud boy, pardoned and unrepentant J6 muppet, but the ho-hum, co-workers, friends, and family members who were maybe a little too loud during election time and too stubborn to listen because confronting the reality of everything, as we all know..

It sucks..

I can't hold a grudge forever, and maybe this is just some therapeutic exercise for me to do some self reflection, take an inventory, and avoid continuing to build resentments and to start making some amends.

Not for them, but for myself, for yourself, for ourselves.

The best way to stay optimistic, is to stay grounded by accepting the things you cannot change, having the courage to change the things you can, and having the wisdom to know the difference.

Thanks for reading :)

TL;DR: You have way more in common with your run-of-the-mill casual Trump voter yelling on social media than you might think. No, not the diaper wearing, house painted, lifted truck flag flying Trumpee, but the random person who simply cast their vote for him and was weird for a bit on social media. Accepting that, will go a long way to reducing your anxiety and finding peace outside of the internet bubble, and in your offline life.

1mluwen,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameTrade/comments/1mluwen/h_lots_of_games_w_trade_for_games_or_paypal_eu/,[H] Lots of Games [W] Trade for Games or Paypal (EU),"**Last Updated List: 09/08/2025**

&nbsp;

I'm primarily looking to trade for games from my **[wishlist](https://redd.it/zw7tvs/)**, otherwise I am also open to selling them. I am not interested in games I already have, only exception are some co-op games, and all games I'm getting for myself are activated on my own account. Other than that feel free to offer your list of Steam games and something I may not have and fulfills my criteria I could/would be willing to trade for it/them.

* To trade you must respond to this thread first, I will not respond or accept anyone outside of this thread, only exception are unless we've traded more than once before.
* Only interested in trading for games on Steam.
* I don't do Humble gifts whether receiving or giving, all my keys are in unrevealed form right after purchase.
* No interest in any keys from an unofficial retailer/source (aka grey market), curator/reviewer keys (aka beta/reviewer/beta-testing/etc.), keys for games that are already free on Steam itself, Steam profile-limited keys, although some interest in VR-titles and/or de-listed games (no banned games).
* Anything marked as wishlist/paypal, it's self-explanatory and I won't look through lists.
* All my keys are EU keys, if you are outside of EU, make sure you double check for any region locks for your country. For quite a few which I was aware of I already listed the region lock, however this is not my responsibility as I did specify the key's region.
* When buying, I only accept payments in Euro's. Minimum purchase of €1,00. Fees are on buyer.

If you're either trading or buying please state the game(s) you are interested in and your offer (game(s)/list/price).

&nbsp;

**Info:**

* Region (and keys region): **Europe**

* **[IGS Rep Page](https://reddit.com/r/IGSRep/comments/zvionr/xiaoliis_igs_rep_page/)**

* **[SteamRep](https://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198074920693)**

&nbsp;

I kindly ask of you is to be reasonable when making offers to make it a fair trade for both of us.

Let's have a good exchange/trade!

1mluvwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1mluvwt/what_are_users_recommendations_for_decent/,What are users recommendations for decent supermarket ground fresh coffee ?,"Reddit is good for some things.. 😄


I've been buying the Asda own house blend (French Style no 5) for a couple of years however oddly our local store has taken it off stock, it is still available online however. 



I used to buy the Lavazza Rosa (in red packets) but this seemed a little heavy on the caffeine, I drink a lot. 


I've tried the Lidl French Roast no 5, it's cheaper than the Asda no 5 but a bit of a bitter aftertaste. I could get used to it however. 


I've tried the Sainsbury's own brand ground coffee with similar price point but this very weak.  I use a stove top Moka Pot so maybe something to do with the grind. 



Any hot tips ? 😄

1mluvv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HellsKitchenFanFics/comments/1mluvv2/hells_kitchen_season_46_big_apple_slice_episode_5/,Hell's Kitchen Season 46: Big Apple Slice Episode 5: Piece of Cake?,"The mood in the dorms across both teams was terrible after [Vaughn's](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Vaughn_Lionals) elimination and [Sammi's](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Sammi_Tryon) transfer to the Blue Team but not because of either of those facts: [Colin](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Colin_Yanders) had to be hospitalized after service after the stomach cramps became debilitating and the chefs were worried about him.

Sammi made it clear to her new teammates as she was trying on her Blue Team Jacket that while she knew that not everyone was going to make it it Black Jackets she didn't want to see anyone potentially go out like that and [Travis](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Travis_Lyedown) and [Elijah](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Elijah_Emmers) agreed, with [Colm](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Colm_Highfander) and [Waylon](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Waylon_Summons) admitting that they'd rather be eliminated traditionally than that, [Mattias](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Mattias_Richcrowne) couldn't even focus on the fact that he was up for elimination for the first time and [Nash](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Nash_Crozard), [Horatio](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Horatio_Clemments), [Miles](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Miles_Stenford) and [Jayson](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Jayson_Aborton) hoped that Colin would be okay.

In the Red Team they had mixed opinions on the matter: they hoped Colin was okay but acknowledged that Sammi was a hell of a get for the Blue Team, [Bobbie](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Bobbie_Rayne) and [Robyn](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Robyn_Eversdale) saw it as a chance for a Red Team member to step up and be a leader though [Becky](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Rebecca_%22Becky%22_Lownesdale) and [Chelsea](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Chelsea_Liowen) didn't think the timing was appropriate given what happened to Colin, [Kat](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Katrina_%22Kat%22_Minxville) and [Mallory](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Mallory_Crennet) however pointed out that a lack of leadership would be seen as weakness by Jazz and [Ruby](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Ruby_Reynolds), [Riley](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Riley_Craine), [Toni](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Toni_Steelz) and [Myra](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Myra_Riversbend) agreed.

# Team Challenge/Colin's Withdrawal

The next morning the chefs arrived in a solemn mood with most of them not able to get much sleep last night because of Colin, they found Jazz, Ramsey and the Sous Chefs (Ashley and Megan for the Red Team and Xander and Flynn for the Blue Team) waiting for them and once they were in line Jazz cut to the chase: Colin's appendix was on the verge of bursting throughout the service (according to what the doctor had told her) and while Colin was on the road to recovery? The doctors had advised him against returning to the competition and Jazz had to honor their word: Colin had been withdrawn for medical reasons.

Once the news set in Jazz asked Sammi if she was happy to remain on the Blue Team given the news and Sammi confirmed that she was, acknowledging that there would be a chef imbalance otherwise, Jazz accepted her decision and told the chefs that while they wished Colin a speedy recovery they needed to move on with the competition.

Jazz wasted little time in getting to work, retrieving a covered dish from under the tasting table: ""Today's Challenge is all about one of New York's most iconic desserts, it's rich, decadent and with the right flavors? Absolutely delicious, today's challenge is all about this!"" At which point Jazz revealed a stunning cheesecake from under the cloche. ""This one was made by our very own Ashley who, as most of you know, was a pasty chef before she competed in Season 30, but when I was designing this challenge a revelation hit me: this was too easy.""

Jazz then revealed two more cloches which had two more cheesecakes, however one was clearly sweet while the other was clearly savory: ""It's choice challenge folks! The theme? Cheesecakes, but the choice is between a sweet cheesecake or a savory cheesecake! The choice is yours! Stand in front of the style you want to cook, savory to the left, sweet to the right."" Jazz let the words hang before adding: ""And here I am, stuck in the middle with you Gordon"" getting a few chuckles from the chefs and Ramsey.

It didn't take long for the chefs to decide on what style of cheesecake they wanted to make: Sammi, Bobbie, Elijah, Riley and Nash went the savory route while everyone else went the sweet route and the two hours started now!

In the Blue Team's Kitchen Xander made a point to welcome Sammi to the Blue Team before asking why she had gone the savory route: ""Look, I love cheesecake but I can't do desserts for shit! At least with savory I'm somewhat within my comfort zone!"" before revealing her plan: bacon fat crust, gruyère + caramelized onion base, balsamic-glazed mushrooms on top and crispy bacon crumbs in the base, Xander wondered if she could pull it off or if she would adjust well to working with the men. ""It's no big deal, I'm the only woman in my brigade back in Atlantic City so I'm used to it, and I've pulled off harder things than this on the line!"".

Sammi then quickly added that she was glad that her mom wasn't present to hear the innuendo while the guys (and Sous Chefs) nearly died of laughter.

As for the other Blue Team Chefs? Nash was honoring his home state of Pennsylvania with his savory cheesecake while Elijah was doing his with cheeseboard elements, the other guys were all working hard to make their sweet cheesecakes shine but what about the Red Team?

Bobbie's reason for going for a savory cheesecake was pretty much the same as Sammi's and she was basing hers of a dish she had in Paris for her eighteenth birthday a few years ago while Riley had gone the savory route to stand out after doing two desserts in a row but was taking a risk by using seafood with her cheesecake in an attempt to do her home city of San Francisco proud, the other women were all doing their best to make their sweet cheesecakes work.

Once time was up Jazz announced that the challenge would feature three guest judges this time, two of whom were Hell's Kitchen alumni: ""In fact? It wasn't all that long ago that these two ladies stood were you currently stand!"" she was talking about two of last year's finalists: runner up and New Yorker [Carla Arrowborn](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Carla_Arrowborn) and, in Jazz's own words, ""a young woman who went through hell twice to earn her Cinderella story: last year's runner up [Trisha Sanders](https://hkfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Trisha_Sanders)!"".

While the chefs greeted Carla with the appropriate respect some were emotional upon seeing the now 21 year old Trisha, a domestic abuse survivor and homeless drug addict who turned her life around and now worked for the Gordon Ramsey group and Trisha herself was all smiles, a stark contrast to how she first entered Hell's Kitchen, and just to added to the emotional weight? The third guest judge was Trisha's new boyfriend and fellow chef Danny.

Before tasting began Jazz just had two questions for Trisha: 1. How did she meet Danny (he was a a new hire at Ashley and Xander's CAX Restaurant in Chicago) and 2. ""How did your sisters react to the butterflied chicken breast?"" causing Trisha to bury her face in her hands and mutter ""oh god"" right before Jazz cued the infamous clip of tee butterflied chicken breast stuffed with Italian sausage and a spicy mayo.............which had been cut to resemble lady parts! All Trisha said was that her three sisters Kayla, Jessica and Sophie had immediately made it their lock screen picture and facetimed her as soon as the episode premiered.

Once that was done they kicked off the tasting with thew newest member of the Blue Team Sammi taking on Bobbie in the battle of the savory cheesecakes and both women got the challenge off to a strong start, while Sammi's cheesecake was ultimately judged to be the better of the two it was by a very small margin as both cheesecakes were delicious.

Riley would help get the Red Team on the board next thanks to her savory seafood cheesecake as Mattias's sweet cheesecake had several fundamental flaws which awarded her the easy win in the second round.

The next round would see a tie as Ruby tied against Elijah as while Elijah's cheeseboard inspired cheesecake was delicious? Ruby's tropical fruit inspired sweet cheesecake proved to be just as good, awarding them both the point.

However the next round between Nash and Chelsea would end up being a total wash as Chelsea's sweet cheesecake was outright terrible while Nash's nod to his home state of Pennsylvania wiped the floor with her creation.

But if you can believe it? Becky's cheesecake was even worse and got wrecked by Travis's chocolate and coffee cheesecake because Becky's baffling decision to use different kinds of nuts all over her cheesecake left it with more of a brownie like texture than a cheesecake texture awarding Travis the easy win.

The next round was a closer affair between Kat and Jayson with Kat managing to keep her team in the game with her red velvet cake inspired cheesecake just edging out Jayson's salted caramel cheesecake.

However the next round would be another total wash for the Blue Team as Miles's apple pie inspired cheesecake wiped the floor with Toni's sad, pathetic looking (and tasting) cheesecake though the fact that Toni admitted that she had never made cheesecake before helped spare her from a thorough roasting.

The next round between Colm and Mallory kept the Red Team in the game though as Mallory's Cookies and Cream inspired cheesecake just edged out Colm's sticky toffee pudding inspired cake but with only Horatio, Myra, Robyn and Waylon left to present there was still a lot to play for as Myra and Horatio were called up for the penultimate round.

Horatio was certainly trying to bribe Jazz with his Lammington inspired cheesecake (much to the Aussie's amusement) but in the end it was just edged out by Myra's triple chocolate decadence cheesecake as while both cakes were delicious the point went to the Red Team in the end.

Robyn's tiramisu inspired cheesecake was certainly a risk and not just because it was made in the same kitchen as the Italian Australian Sous Chef Ashley but it was a risk that paid off as it was delicious and while Waylon's strawberry shortcake inspired cheesecake it was deemed too sweet, awarding the Red Team their second straight challenge win.

# Reward

The Red Team were taken on a hiking/glamping trip in New York.

# Punishment

While the Blue Team were out glamping the Blue Team had to deal with delivery day and cleaning both kitchens ahead of the fourth service, during a break in between the two punishments Sammi talked with her new teammates, pointing out that a good way to bounce back from three straight losses (two challenge and one service) would be to use Colin's situation as motivation heading into the next service: ""you know, say we're doing this for Colin and shit"" and the guys agreed with her, even after Elijah pointed out that Sammi was the main cause of two of those losses: ""What can I say Eli? I hate losing consecutively!""

  
Before Service

When the Red Team returned and got changed into their uniforms they got right to work in getting ready for the coming service, Becky, Toni and Chelsea were motivated to bounce back from the challenge but were they are motivated as the Blue Team?

Before service started Jazz addressed both teams and told them that with the competition was only going to get harder from here and for the first time since opening night? There would be VIPs dining at the Chef's Tables: Carla and her husband and daughter would be dining in the Red Team's kitchen while Trisha and Danny would be dining in the Blue Team's kitchen.

Dinner Service

  
Tableside: Red Team: Toni, Blue Team: Mattias

  
Hot Apps: Red Team: Mallory and Kat, Blue Team: Waylon and Elijah

  
Cold Apps: Red Team: Robyn and Riley. Blue Team: Miles and Nash

  
Meat: Red Team: Becky and Bobbie, Blue Team: Sammi and Jayson

  
Fish: Red Team: Chelsea and Ruby, Blue Team: Horatio

  
Garnish: Red Team: Myra, Blue Team: Colm and Travis

  
Dessert: Red Team: Kat, Blue Team: Waylon

  
The two commis chefs were on tableside that night as Toni and Mattias served tableside shrimp scampi tagliatelle though Mattias, ever the nervous wreck, had some issues early on.

# The Red Team's Service:

Kat and Mallory got the Red Team off to a good start on Hot Apps but they had some early issues that, while minor, slowed down the kitchen when for about a second, then when Jazz called out a new order Becky made the mistake of talking over her and Chelsea was so focused on her scallops order that she ignored Jazz completely, earning them both reprimands.

Aside from that? Becky (on meat with Bobbie) and Chelsea (on fish with Ruby) had a relatively decent service but it was marred by issues as the service progressed but what about the Blue Team?

# The Blue Team's Service:

Sammi was clearly motivated to make her first night on the Blue Team one to remember but her earlier rallying had motivated the rest of the Blue Team to put on their best performance yet with Waylon and Elijah rocking Hot Apps, Miles and Nash doing well on Cold Apps and Miles and Horatio leading the charge on Cold Apps but what about the meat station which Sammi was working on with Jayson?

Put simply, it was the best station of the Blue Team's service, with Trisha commenting to Danny that Sammi was performing like she was in the Black Jackets even though it was still early in the competition, in the end the Blue Team had to be sent in to the Red Team's Kitchen because that's how far ahead of the Red Team they had finished and the Red Team weren't exactly thrilled about it.

# Post-mortem

Jazz congratulated the Blue Team on their service yet and then turned to the Red Team, telling them outright that that was the worst service yet and told them to come up with two names for elimination.

Once in the dorms the Red Team quickly nominated Becky and Chelsea but an argument ensured when Becky tried (and failed) to nominate Toni citing her lack of experience compared to the others and her poor cheesecake from that morning's challenge, however the Red Team quickly shot that down as Kat pointed out that, by that logic Riley (the youngest contestant at 21 who was still a culinary student) should go up for elimination even though Riley had been great in challenges and services so far.

# Elimination

Toni named Back and Chelsea as the Red Team's nominees and Jazz called them forward...........before addressing Toni again, having picked up on the anger in the young cook's voice, Toni wasted little time in calling out Becky for her attempt at throwing Toni under the bus to save her rear end and Jazz wasn't impressed.

Jazz made it clear to Becky that nominees were supposed to be on the merits on service alone and that Toni had been working tableside that night thus nowhere near the chaos, when asked if they should stay in Hell's Kitchen both Becky and Chelsea claimed that they were fighters and were willing to show that they weren't done.

In the end? Both women were sent back in line, Jazz reminded the chefs of what she had said after the Punishment Pass Challenge after nominating seven chefs for their poor apple dishes: while there would be no breaks from elimination this season Jazz had said that she would make a exception in the case of a medical emergency, while she had hoped that it wouldn't come to that Colin's medical exit had allowed for such an occasion but she warmed them that they were running out of time.

Colin's Elimination Statement: (N/A)

Jazz's Elimination Comment (V/O): *""When I warned the chefs that there would be no breaks from elimination I added a caveat in case of injury, tonight I had to use it because of Colin's appendicitis but Becky and Chelsea's chances are running low.""*",3,1754759989.0,HellsKitchenFanFics,0,1.0,False

1mlupqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1mlupqp/rate_my_routine_tips_and_advice/,"rate my routine, tips and advice?","hello all, recently i have upped my supplement game and thought i'd come here to seek feedback on whether i'm over-supplementing, doing anything counterproductive, etc. first here is a little about me:

33 female

work a sedentary office job but train 6 days a week - HIIT, Pilates and weightlifting, hobby dance classes

overweight but working on it (10lbs down so far woo)

big time foodie who does 16/8 intermittent fasting. my diet is okay but not the best. i rarely go out and cook at home most days. i try to make my meals balanced with protein fiber fat and carbs. because of my work schedule and i like to sleep in on my days off, i usually break my fast between 11-12 with a medium sized meal, have some snacks throughout the day, cook and eat dinner with my husband and begin fasting again around between 7 and 8pm. we love Korean and Japanese food. i do have a big sweet tooth, most days it is pretty well contained, but i physically cannot say no to a donut

other health concerns and medications i take - Zoloft and Wellbutrin for depression and anxiety (managed), Amlodipine for high blood pressure (was not severe and is managed and getting better, think it's hereditary from my dad) Vestura hormonal birth control (drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol) for PMDD (managed) i have extremely mild asthma that is mostly 100% gone but i have to use my rescue inhaler like. once every six months. this year i was dealing with some weird random onset IBS-D but discover it was from aspartame and i was drinking diet coke daily, since i cut that out i haven't had any issues. i have random intermittent dyshidrotic eczema that is now mostly dormant but i do have the topical cream Opzelura that i use when i have a flare up. i also use tretinoin on my face every night. that's all!

* my morning routine when i break my fast:

I take all my prescriptions except my birth control

I take vitamin d3 gummies from Aldi. i started taking them because i deal with random intermittent phantom smells of cigarette smoke and have for multiple years over multiple living locations in which nobody smoked, and i saw a reddit comment saying it could be a sign of vitamin d deficiency

I take omega-3s. i just finished my first bottle of fish oil and saw somewhere else on reddit that vegan omegas/algae oil is better and more sustainable so i just switch to that instead

* As needed:

I have a sublingual liquid b-complex that i take as needed for fatigue. Ever since i first had Covid i dealt with some fatigue issues, they have definitely been lessening as time goes on, but if i start to feel really fatigued i will take my b vitamins and they help a lot. i don't drink a ton of caffeine - a cup or two of coffee in the morning and a cup of tea in the afternoon, no caffeinated soda anymore

* my evening routine which i take after dinner:

i take my birth control

i take a gummy multivitamin, i have used Olly women's multivitamins but currently am just taking a general adult multivitamin also from Aldi

i take a collagen gummy for hair and skin health, i have taken collagen powders and such in the past but a gummy/pill is easier. the one i take also contains biotin

* before bed:

i take sublingual liquid melatonin

* thoughts:

i have vitamin e softgels on the way. my ssris give me CRAZY night sweats (and day sweats too lol) and i saw someone on the hyperhydrosis subreddit say that vitamin e is often taken by menopausal women to help with their hot flashes, and that it helped them a lot with their night sweats.

fiber? i was using metamucil when i was dealing with my IBS-D, before i realized what triggered it, but i got the sugar free version cause no calories and was unknowingly making it worse the whole time ;0; i'd like to supplement fiber for general colon health, i don't have any poop issues at all now, i'm very regular and healthy, but i have seen everyone online freaking out about GI cancers in young people and how fiber can help prevention. i'm also on a weight loss journey and know it can help with that. we actually have like 2 bottles of psyllium husk pills that my husband got but i have never taken them because i'm put off by the number of pills and frequency of dosage.

protein? i am not tracking calories or macros, i HATE doing that, it does not fit into my lifestyle and makes me miserable and will cause me to abandon my weight loss journey immediately. i understand that my progress may be slower than others because of that. that is fine. to that end i still don't really understand protein and how and when i am supposed to supplement it. like i said i try to balance my meals with protein fiber fat and carbs but i'm not necessarily eating with protein in mind. i have a protein powder that i sometimes add to my morning greek yogurt and fruit parfait. and i have canned protein shakes that i grab when i'm going to a dance class right after work. but that's about it!

calcium? the women in my family have a history of bone density problems. i'm still pretty young but should i start supplementing calcium?

overall since i started IF and my current training and supplement routine i feel really great! i am not a super intense health minmaxer but i am learning to truly enjoy taking care of myself. thank you so much if you read all of this and if you have any suggestions!!",1,1754759555.0,Supplements,1,1.0,False

Before brunch lines curled down U Street,  
it was Ben’s Chili Bowl smoke and mumbo sauce stains,  
jukeboxes in carryouts,  
and the faint perfume of half-smokes at midnight.

Shaw, you wore your history in brick and mural,  
told stories in the chipped paint of rowhouse stoops.  
Petworth had porches where grandmas kept watch like sentinels,  
their folding chairs the law of the land.  
In Anacostia, the go-go beat bounced off Barry Farms walls,

glass towers where corner stores once knew your name,  
rooftop bars where rooftop pigeons used to rule.

1mlulo6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mlulo6,"Weekly Update: August 8, 2025","As you may be aware, I'm pretty concerned about price levels.

With PLTR slated to release earnings on this past Monday, I shut down a profitable credit put spread that afternoon.

They had great results and guidance, and popped on Tuesday.

So, I brought out my ""OBF"" (""Out By Friday"") playbook. Basically, short term trades intending to have the position closed by Friday. I figured that the market would stay up, at least through this Friday.

So on Tuesday, I did 2 buy/writes: one on NVDA and one on PLTR, as well as a CPS on PLTR.

Wednesday, I did 7 more buy/writes: IBIT, IONQ, NBIS, NNE, QBTS, QUBT, and RGTI.

What's been particularly fun is that I've been putting my [Excel Trade Constructor](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockOptionCoffeeShop/comments/1m9rxno/excel_trade_constructor/) through its paces. It's been extraordinarily helpful. I'm not sure I would have done the Wednesday trades without it.

At the end of the week, 6 of the 9 buy/write trades were assigned. Of the 3 that weren't, only NNE was ""underwater"" (bought at $38.40, premium of $1.10, ending spot of $35.46, so down a net of $1.84/share. The strike I'm looking at next week of $35.50 shows a premium of $1.65, so if called away, this one would be a $0.19/share loser. So, to recap, 3 of the 9 buy/writes remain, so not totally ""OBF"", but not bad; I don't expect a 100% hit rate. By my calculations, they provided a 0.8% return to the trading portfolio.

...

The biggest drag this week was SMR, which tumbled after earnings; the trading portfolio took a 0.7% hit on my two open positions (a CSP and LEAPS). I was able to exit a SMR CPS with a $40 short for a decent profit after the earnings release.

...

It's interesting how on the cumulative P&L graph you can see where I ""became bearish"": the last 3 weeks I've essentially been flat, going from a cumulative P&L % of 44.8% on July 18 to 44.5% on Aug 8.",1,1754759269.0,StockOptionCoffeeShop,0,1.0,False

It was helpful to read everyone’s tips ahead of my trip, so offering my own, with my perspective as a single woman traveling alone. Traveled Aug 1-Aug 7.

I planned this trip VERY last minute – about a month ahead, so there was limited availability for housing, rental cars, and tickets/passes for various activities.

**Hotel / Stay:** I booked a place in Columbia Falls, which is a very small but cute town between Whitefish and Coram, and about a 30(ish?) min drive to the West Glacier entrance. I stayed at Meadowlake Resort – happy to answer questions about it if desired. I was able to get a last minute room at Many Glacier Hotel - see Day 2. 

**Airport notes:** Flew into Glacier International Airport in Kalispell, and rented a car there. Airport is TINY (7 gates).  I landed around 10:30 pm, and got my rental car within 30 mins. It was very easy/convenient, but of note if you are traveling alone and land at night - you have to walk out in the pitch black to the rental car lot and find your car. The lot is about a 5 min walk from the exit, and there was almost no light.  I had to use the flashlight on my phone to read the space number to find my car. I was a little unnerved walking alone with piles of stuff in total darkness; if you’re alone you may want to wait and walk out with the person behind you in line.

To return your car (at least in the early morning) you will just drive to the rental car return, park in your rental company’s area of the parking lot and walk in. I expected a person to take the car from me, which is what I’ve experienced at every other airport but that was not the routine at Glacier. 

My return flight was early and I got to the airport around 7 am and there was no wait at the airline counter or TSA.

**Bear spray:** There are bear spray rentals at the airport, but the stand was closed when I arrived and when I departed, so that did not work for me. I ended up renting bear spray from a vending machine just outside the Firebrand Hotel in Whitefish - 4 days for $25 vs. $50-60 for a new can at a store. 

**General info, if traveling alone -** I have AT&T. and my service was horrible pretty much everywhere. I had one bar in Columbia Falls and couldn't send/receive texts most of the time. This also meant that navigation was difficult. I relied heavily on printed maps. Highly recommend getting a waterproof, detailed map (Nat Geo makes one) of GNP/Waterton Lakes. It was very useful. I had to spend a lot of my mornings studying a map and trying to get my bearings b/c I could not use my navigation system a lot of the time. I had no service at all in the park except at the lodges. Lodges will not give you the wifi password unless you are a paying guest.

**Itinerary -** 

***Day 1 - Whitefish / Columbia Falls***. It was pouring rain all day my first day, and I needed time to adjust to the elevation so I ended up just wandering around Whitefish and Columbia Falls rather than driving all the way around the park to hike in the driving rain. Call me soft. Whitefish was very cute – lots of shops and restaurants and a nice place to chill to get my bearings and map out plans for the next four days. I was able to get a spot at the bar at **Abruzzo** and the food was perfect from start to finish. One of the best meals I’ve had in a year. You can get reservations a few days ahead on Open Table, but I would not try to walk in as a party of 2+ unless you are ok waiting a long time. 

***Day 2 & 3 - Many Glacier*** 

I got a last minute room at Many Glacier Hotel.  They have several cancellations daily. You can check the Glacier National Park lodging site and there are often same day or next day openings. I lucked into the cheapest rate room and took it ($300 total, with tax). This booking gave me access to Many Glacier Road by car and shaved a lot of time and stress off for me so it was worth it. 

Started the morning in Columbia Falls with breakfast at **Uptown Hearth**  \- 10/10 would eat here for breakfast and lunch every day. Great food from scratch and great coffee, nice people. Bright and airy. No public wifi.

Did not have GTTS westbound pass, so I drove around the park. It was a beautiful drive and took slightly less time than GTTS would have taken. Stopped at St. Mary’s visitor center to get an America the Beautiful Pass b/c I will be at two other parks this year. Then drove to the Many Glacier entrance – about 30 mins away. The St. Mary’s visitor center parking was nuts (12:30/1 pm on Sunday) . Couldn’t even use the restroom or get out of my car.

Arrived to Many Glacier Hotel and left my things in the car. I wanted to do the Grinell Glacier hike, but it was a little late so I walked down to the boat launch to see if I could get the boat to Lake Josephine to shave off some time. There was a waitlist but only two of the 15 people on it actually showed up, so I was able to walk on the boat. The boat ride was lovely. The hike was the most beautiful I’ve ever done - 10/10. It is challenging, like others have noted. I got to the overlook around 4:45 pm, and I could see two people sitting close to the water, but no one else. A storm was coming, so I started back. I could not see any markers at all from where I was, and there was no one else in sight. I saw two walking paths and one was closer to the way I came so I took it. It was not a trail. I got lost fairly quickly. I could not figure out a safe way back to the trail and I ended up blowing a whistle and yelling for about 15 mins with no luck finding the other handful of people. Thankfully I was able to get satellite reception on iMessages and I was able to text a friend to tell the hotel I was lost and alone. I calmed down enough to scramble over a lot of rocks back down to the water, where I thought I’d be easiest to find. I saw four guys near the water and screamed at them to hold still so I could get to them. They waited and we were able to walk down together in a bad thunderstorm. The lesson I learned here as a solo hiker is that you can’t start late on one of the harder trails. It would have been fine on Hidden Lake or Trail of the Cedars, but for Grinell it was not fine and not smart. Lesson learned! 

**Day 3** \- Breakfast at hotel and then drove westward on GTTS Road. I got a late start b/c all my stuff was drenched and I spent a ton of time trying to dry out my boots with the hair dryer. Hiked St. Mary’s / Virginia Falls. Really pretty trails. Lots of people!  Got to Logan Pass around 4. The sign said lot full, but there were at least 20 spots. Hiked the Hidden Lake Trail. Saw deer, long horned sheep, and missed a family of grizzlies by about 2 mins, but was able to see them frolicking on the hill at a distance. The trail was gorgeous and still well populated even at 6 pm. Drove out of the park, and back to Columbia Falls. Of note, by 9 pm it’s hard to get food. Several people suggested Stonefly - a local dive bar. I walked in, and it seemed great but there was nothing vegetarian so I just headed back to my hotel. 

**Day 4 - Whitefish**. I didn't have any passes for the park and didn't feel like driving 2.5 hours there and back, so I planned to hike the Danny On trail up to the top of the Whitefish Mountain Resort  and take a chair lift back down. However, by the time i had lunch, chatted with locals for advice about doing this, and drove there and parked and figured out how to get on the trail (which I didn't know ahead of time) it was 3:45 pm. The staff said I’d likely miss the last chair down (5:30 pm--had no idea it would be so early!). I got horrific blisters from the soaking wet Grinell downhill hike, and there was no way I could walk a steep trail downhill.  So I just rode the lift up, had a beer at the top, and rode it back down again in a thunderstorm. LOL me and downhill thunderstorms. Whitefish had a big farmer’s market with food trucks and music, so I hung around there for the evening. 

**Day 5 -** On day 2 I got a last minute ticket for the Lake McDonald boat tour, which gives access to GTTS road from West Glacier. Headed to Lake McDonald Lodge; arrived around 11 am and parking was tough. I ended up parking along the road. There were no designated spots for the boat company, FYI. Took the boat ride, which was about an hour. It was very nice. Then I rented a stand up paddleboard - they are first come, first served and no one else rented one so I hopped right on. They also had plenty of kayaks left. I paddled around Lake McDonald for over an hour and it was amazing. No wind, calm water, and very few people out on the lake. I was able to get a seat at the bar in the Lodge’s lounge, and ate there. Again, an advantage of traveling alone. The line for the restaurant starts before 5, and it was extremely long. There is a casual pizza place which may have been less crowded, but the dining room area and the lounge were totally packed all afternoon. If you are there for the boat tour, I'd plan to eat elsewhere if you are a party of 2+.  Drove to Trail of Many Cedars and walked there, and walked part of Avalanche Lake trail, but it was getting late (around 5 pm?) and there were not very many people on the trail so I turned around. Took a slow drive out of the park. 

**Overall summary:**

The trip was amazing. The benefits of taking your time and starting late are easier parking and less crowded trails. The downside was being alone on trails in an unfamiliar place. I highly recommend walking with bear spray (esp if you are hiking alone) and carrying a poncho. It rained every afternoon I was there. A poncho is helpful b/c it will cover your pack. I also recommend buying a multisize pack of compeed blister bandages. I wish I'd had them for the Grinell hike b/c I might have been able to do the Highline Trail. Instead, I had a half-dollar sized wound. :(

If you are flexible and patient, you’ll have a great time. In some ways I was annoyed with myself that I had to spend so much time each day mapping out a plan and flexing b/c my things were soaked and I got horrific blisters which killed my plan for the Highline Trail. :( But in other ways, mapping my plans daily according to weather and personal needs worked out well for me. People cancel hotel and boat bookings frequently, so it’s worth checking daily!

basically I (f15) is friends with D (m16) and he’s been really pissing me off since last year for a number of reasons, I know if I cut him off it would cause tension in our friend group and him being super passive aggressive. I’ll provide a list of reasons why I don’t wanna be friends with him. I feel bad because he was one of my first and only friends when I transferred to my current school.

1. He touches me inappropriately even tho i’ve asked him to stop

2. He throws food at me even tho I told him to stop (I feel like it should already be an expectation to NOT throw food when ur 16)

3. He doesn’t respect boundaries

4. He urges me to yell at my parents when i’m upset

5. He isn’t self aware and refuses to believe he’s done anything wrong

6. he got on top of one of my friends and make my friend super uncomfortable

7. He gets upset when I hang out with my friends without him

8. He tries pressuring me into letting him come over to my house (i’ve always made excuses for him to not come over but he insists anyway)

9. he complains about how he hates it when people text him then gets mad when I don’t text him

10. He thinks anyone who looks in his direction is in love with him

11. he always asks me for money and to pay for his stuff even tho he already has money

12. Gets mad when I don’t give him a sip of my coffee/tea/whatever because i’m a germaphobe and whenever he takes a “sip” of someone’s drink he drinks 
most of it

just a thought though, I really don’t want to cause tension in our friend groups. A few other people in my friend group don’t like him for similar reasons but it’s whatever I guess, any advice would be appreciated I don’t know what to do",1,1754759235.0,teenagers,4,1.0,False

Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency many thanks. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

After months of late nights, coffee, and rewriting entire chapters, I finally hit “publish” on my very first self-help eBook.  
It’s a project that grew out of my own journey of personal growth, and I wanted to turn it into something that could actually help others as well.

“Why don’t we try some Freeze Tag to get back into characters?” Mara suggested.

Freeze Tag was one of Mara’s favorite activities. To play, two players must start a scene. At any point during their scene, another player can clap or say ‘freeze’, then take over one of the scene players' parts. 

“Lila, Dan, you two can start.” She said.

Lila stood immediately. Dan was slower. He always seemed a little unsure of these exercises. 

They began a scene that started out as an office vending machine exchange. With Lila playing the part of ‘office vending machine’. 

Mara tagged herself in, and the scene morphed into 

Natalie joined after the scene became just a bit too long. She and Mara turned it into

While they all took turns, Chris sat in his seat, arms crossed. He hadn’t tagged himself into the game even once. 

“Freeze! But, this time, I volunteer Chris to join.” Dan said, pointing a finger at Chris.

Chris didn’t seem to notice this at first. He stayed frozen, not blinking. 

“Chris we all agreed to do this retreat in character the entire time, pl-” Mara started, but she didn’t finish her sentence. 

He slowly stood and walked to the scene that Lila and Natalie had created. Lila stepped away without a word, allowing Chris to take her place. 

He began to speak. This time without any script. 

“You call this play, but it is truth. You pretend at death, but I remember it.” He said flatly, lacking any of the drama he had infused his original monologue with. 

“Uhh.. I guess as the only doctor on shift tonight you would..” Natalie tried to play off of Chris’s words and keep the scene going. 

It wasn’t convincing. 

“This script is older than bone, and the audience, even older.” Chris continued, not even attempting to work with Natalie's words. 

“Okay Chris, we get it, you took a workshop at Julliard, now can you please work with your scene partner?” Mara said. 

At that, Chris dropped low into a crouch, hands touching the ground. Natalie jumped slightly at his abrupt movement. She wasn’t sure what to do to continue this scene. 

“So we’re doing creepy, scary, scenes now. Got it.” Lila said, unfazed. 

Natalie let out a nervous laugh. 

“Uhmm.. let me join you?” Natalie said as she slowly crouched down, mirroring Chris.

“Great, great job Natalie!” Mara said, clapping her hands, pleased that Natalie was able to work around Chris. 

Chris still did not speak. 

They waited, and they waited, for him to add onto the scene. But he did not budge. 

Finally, Dan had had enough. 

“Freeze!” He said, stepping towards Natalie and Chris. 

He tapped Chris’s shoulder, the signal that Dan was going to take his place in the scene. 

Chris didn’t move. 

“Hey man, I’m tagging in.” Dan said gently.

There was no response. Natalie looked at Mara and Lila, who were watching, bewildered.

Dan started to lean forward to speak more directly to Chris. 

At this, Chris’s head snapped towards Dan. He didn’t move like he was turning his head to listen, or even to exit the scene. His head had moved like it was attached to puppet strings. 

“Your name is not yours any longer.” Chris said, voice croaking.

“Alright. Cool. Cool cool cool. We’re doing a scary possessed bit then? I can do that.” Dan said, quickly adjusting himself to mimic Chris and Natalie. 

As soon as Dan had assumed the position that Chris was in, Chris snapped himself up to standing. Again, it was a very jerky, snap movement. 

Once he was fully standing he grinned. The grin didn’t reach his eyes. They remained cold and empty. 

“Wow, he’s really good at committing to the bit.” Lila whispered, leaning over to Mara. 

“Great job, Chris, I appreciate your dedication.” Mara said, giving him a small tap on the shoulder as he walked past her, and headed straight to the house. She swore that as she touched him, she felt a small shock. 

Dan and Natalie continued their scene, both mimicking Chris in their own ways, but never quite nailing it down. Lila joined in as well, the three of them crouching or crawling in the dirt. Mara did not feel like crawling around the ground in the dark. 

“Let’s call it a night guys. Get some rest so we can continue this tomorrow.” She said to the group. 

Dan and Natalie stood, joints creaking. Natalie did a small full-body stretch. She wasn’t used to crawling around like that, and it had hurt her knees. 

“That was great, Mara, I love being able to channel my animal spirit guides.” Lila said as she continued her crouch crawl towards the house. 

Mara, Dan, and Natalie shared a look. This was classic Lila. She didn’t even need the improvisation exercises to do these things. They were just a convenient excuse. 

They made it into the house and headed off to their separate bedrooms, noting that Chris’s room was dark underneath the door. 

**ACT 2: Chapter 7: The Next Morning**

It was 9:04 AM. Breakfast was scheduled for 9 AM. Mara was anxious. 

She was the only one in the kitchen, dressed and prepared for the day, and for their scheduled breakfast. 

As she waited for the rest of the group to come down, she reviewed the day's schedule. 

9 AM - Breakfast 

9:30 AM - Check In for the day

10 AM - Warmups:

8 PM - Closing activities

Underneath the last activity of the night, Mara added, ‘by the campfire’. She felt like they had made some breakthroughs during last night's fire, and was hoping to recreate some of that magic.

As she finished updating her schedule, Dan and Lila entered the kitchen. 

“Sorry we’re a bit late Mara, it’s hard to get ready for the day when only one bathroom has a shower!” Lila said.

“It might be easier if we doubled up on showers; you and I can go together.” Dan said, winking at Lila. 

Lila was used to Dan's occasional corny comments, so she did not feel the need to respond. 

“I can create a shower schedule if that helps.” Mara offered, genuinely. 

Dan laughed in response. Mara didn’t understand why Dan laughed at her offer of assistance. 

“I don’t think that will be necessary, Mara. Thanks, though.” He said between chuckles. 

“What did I miss?” Natalie asked as she walked in. 

“Just Dan attempting to conserve water and failing.” Lila replied. 

“Hey, you haven’t even given my idea any consideration. How do you know it would fail?” Dan said, picking up an apple from the counter.

“Has anyone seen Chris this morning? We just need him, and then we can get started.” Mara asked the group.

“I’m sure he’ll be down soon. We can probably get started without him.” Dan offered.

As soon as Dan finished his sentence, Chris entered the kitchen. He looked slightly disheveled and was missing some of his usual necklaces. 

“Good morning, Chris! Still feeling creepy scary this morning?” Lila asked with a smile. 

“What?” He asked, rubbing his eyes with his palms before reaching for the coffee pot. 

“Nevermind.” Lila said, sitting at the table and picking up a piece of toast. 

“Thanks for joining us Chris. We need to get the day started since we’re a little behind.” Mara said, gently wringing her hands. It was 9:08 AM. 

“Let’s eat some breakfast, review today's schedule, and get into character.”

As they prepared for the day, Chris was visibly struggling. He yawned, rubbed his eyes, drank his coffee, and didn’t say much. While Mara, Dan, and Lila debated some of the open-ended activities of the day, Natalie leaned over towards Chris.

“Hey man, doing okay this morning?” She asked.

“Yeah.. yeah. Too much whiskey, I think. I’ll survive.” He responded, taking another sip of his coffee.

Natalie found his answer to be sufficient. She had also woken up with a bit of a headache. She wasn’t used to bonfires, beer, and staying up late. But here she was.

She noticed as Chris lifted his coffee cup to his lips, his hand shook lightly.

Lila offered to lead the breathing exercises to warm up the group. She loved this kind of thing. It was something she did on her own, outside of the retreat. 

They all sat facing Lila, eyes closed, on the floor of the living room. The old wood floors creaked when they moved, and dust had flown into the air as they arranged themselves.

The group was struggling to grasp her explanation of Ujjayi breath.

“I *said*, slightly constrict the back of the throat while inhaling and exhaling through the nose. It should create a soft, audible sound as you breathe.”

Dan let out a noise that was almost a ‘moo’. Mara and Natalie didn’t make any noise at all. 

Chris made a noise that sounded to Lila like a suppressed scream. 

Lila opened her eyes to find the group had already opened theirs and had been staring at her blankly. 

Dan was grinning, trying hard not to laugh. Mara looked tense, knuckles turning white where she had set them on her knees. Natalie looked like she was in a dentist's chair. 

Lila wasn’t sure what Chris was doing, but she was sure that it was creepy, and he was really going above and beyond in his character work this retreat.

Mara stood and went next to Lila.

“Alright, thanks, Lila, for that… helpful demonstration.” She said, clearly struggling for the right adjective to use in this situation. 

“Let’s get even more warmed up with some Mirroring!” Mara told them enthusiastically.

“How about Chris and Lila work together, and Dan and Natalie. Since there are five of us, I’ll moderate and give tips.”

They moved into their pairs, remaining seated on the hardwood floor.

Mirroring was another improv exercise that Mara loved. It involved taking two people, with one person as the ‘leader’ and the other as their ‘mirror’ image. The leader would make movements or gestures, and the mirror image would try to mimic them in real time. It was a good way to build connections in the group and help them find responses faster.

Each pair faced the other. 

While Dan and Natalie each offered the other to begin as the leader, Chris had immediately locked eyes with Lila and began a slow movement.

At first, it’s funny. Chris is doing his usual overperforming approach. Creating large sweeping gestures and exaggerated facial expressions. 

Lila is mirroring him, but the emotion in her movements is not as strong as his. 

They continue in this way for a few minutes until Mara tells them to switch leaders.

Now Lila is the leader, and Chris is her mirror.

Lila is making hand motions that could resemble spell casting, and Chris is attempting to mirror her, but ultimately his movements come at a slight delay behind Lila’s. 

As she holds one hand high above her head, Chris does the same a beat later. Once he’s successfully mirrored that part, Lila decides that she will let her arm fall back down. 

She loved to surprise her mirror.

But as she made this decision, and her arm began to drop with the force of gravity, Chris's arm came right along with it. 

There was no way he could have done that in perfect unison with her; he would have had to have been reading her mind to know what she was going to do. 

Lila continued, now trying to create a disparity between her actions and her mirrors. 

She slowly raised the same hand, arm outstretched. As she did this, she would raise her palm quickly and then quickly flick it down, like she was trying to shake something off her hand. 

Chris moved perfectly with her again. 

Mara glanced at the two of them and wondered who was the leader, and who was the mirror?

Lila tilts her head, so does he.

Lila leans back, so does he.

Frustrated, Lila jumps to her feet. Chris is face-to-face with her when she stands.

“How are you doing this?” She says

“How are you doing this?” Chris overlaps her, his voice very low

This exchange gets Dan and Natalie to look at the two of them. 

“Okay, seriously, Chris, stop, it’s freaky.” Lila says, taking a step back.

“Okay, seriously, Chris, stop, it’s freaky.” Chris again overlaps, speaking in unison with Lila. This time, his voice is high-pitched, and when Lila takes her step back, Chris takes a step forward. Towards her.

“Chris, man, we know you’re good at this game, relax,” Dan says, now fully turning his body to watch what’s unfolding.

“No, this is good stuff, keep it going.” Mara says, eyes wide, unable to look away from Lila and Chris.

“Mara, I don't want to do this anymore.” Lila says, voice shaking, taking another step back towards the door to the living room.

Again, Chris speaks in unison with her, this time it almost sounds as if there are three voices, not just two. 

And again, as she steps back, Chris steps forward.

Lila feels an urge, an instinct, and runs. 

She leaves the living room, runs up the stairs, and goes to her bedroom. There, she shuts the door and steps back from it. 

Chris is in lock step behind her. Not even caring to copy her exact footsteps or facial expressions. His face is blank. 

Mara, Dan, and Natalie are shocked. They’ve never seen anything like this before. They follow the two of them as fast as they can up the stairs.

When they reach the landing and can see Lila’s bedroom door, Chris is standing in front of it, smiling. It’s another wide smile that doesn’t reach his eyes, or the rest of his body, as his hands are clenched tightly at his side, and his breathing is rapid.

From behind the door, there’s a weak voice.

“Pineapple, pineapple, pineapple!” Lila says, getting louder with each iteration.

“Pineapple, pineapple, pineapple!” Chris overlaps again. 

But when they finish speaking, Chris doubles over, almost like someone has punched him in the gut.

He puts his hands on his knees, breathing heavily.

“I didn’t know I could move like that.” He says between breaths.

“Man, what was that? You were moving with her in real time, and you changed voices?!” Dan asked incredulously.

“Method acting to the extreme I guess.” Chris said, standing up and walking towards the three of them at the end of the hall.

As he approaches, Natalie takes a small, almost imperceptible step back. 

“Are you okay?” Mara asks him cautiously as he passes her. 

“Yeah, yeah, I think so.. Was that too much?” Chris asked with mock innocence. 

He stands at the top of the stairs, looking at the rest of the group. Dan leans over towards him and whispers praises of his abilities in his ear.

Mara approaches Lila’s door and opens it.

“The scene is over, Lila, you can come out now.” She tells her.

“What was that, Chris? That wasn’t improv, I don’t even know what that was! That was genuinely scary, Chris, what the hell?” Lila says, taking a step into the hall.

“Sorry Lila, I swear I thought we were still doing the exercise..” He says, holding both hands up.

“Okay so now we know Chris’s character is some creepy Olympic demon I guess.” Dan says with a chuckle as he starts to descend the stairs. 

“Is it too late for me to try out for next year's Olympics?” Chris asks sarcastically, following Dan down the stairs. 

“There aren’t any Olympics for another 2 years Chris,” Mara says flatly, not turning to look at him.

“Great sense of humor Mara, really top notch.” Chris shouts from the bottom of the stairs.

Natalie follows behind Chris, keeping her eyes on him as she does. 

Lila lightly grabs Mara’s wrist as she turns to begin to walk away.

Mara stops.

“Hey.. that was like..really weird, right? I’m not overreacting?” Lila asks her, eyes big, on the verge of tears.

“You weren’t overreacting, Chris was doing his usual *overacting*.. But you have to admit his abilities in that game were out of this world.” Mara said.

“Yeah.. yeah. He’s really good at it.” Lila says, letting Mara’s wrist go.

Mara follows the rest of the group down the stairs, dollar signs in her mind, thinking about Chris’ performance.

Lila stands at the top of the stairs and looks down. 

She is almost afraid to join them. 

“I’m okay. I just wasn’t prepared for his intensity, that’s all.. He was just playing the game. And he’s really good at it.” She tells herself, before facing her fears and going downstairs.

Any links ?,"To exact revenge, she struck a deal with the cold, ruthless head of a powerful family. After their plan succeeded, he cornered her against a wall, his voice almost pitiful. ""I helped you take down those people. Don't you think you owe me some time alone?"" She froze, stunned. Had their alliance turned into something else?
=====
""You've weathered countless storms over the years. Welcome home, Arabella.""
At the celebratory dinner, a young man in a perfectly tailored suit found himself unwilling to look away from Arabella Stanley. 
She possessed an otherworldly beauty, her sharp features sculpted with precision and wrapped in an aura of cool detachment. 
Her piercing eyes revealed nothing of her inner thoughts, and when she spoke, her voice carried the same arctic chill. ""I'm leaving now.""
Joshua Willis, the young man, seized the moment without hesitation. ""Allow me to drive you home.""
Arabella offered no resistance. 
The car glided through the night. The city lights blurred past as Joshua stole glances at her profile.
""When do you plan to return to the company? Our empire continues to flourish.""
Their partnership had begun years ago through a chance project, and Joshua had witnessed Arabella's brilliance firsthand. 
He had persuaded her to join forces, and together they had forged a company that now dominated the entire industry. 

Arabella maintained her measured tone. ""I'll decide when the time feels right. For now, I simply want to reach home.""

""Understood completely. You must be eager to reunite with Daisy. She's undoubtedly thriving. I've been directing all the premium projects to your aunt's husband throughout these years."" Joshua's grin widened as he angled for recognition. 

Arabella and her twin sister Daisy Stanley had lost their parents at the tender age of six, and their aunt Meagan Tucker had stepped in to care for them both. 

Arabella acknowledged him with a subtle nod. ""I appreciate that.""

Her delicate fingers found the cherry blossom pendant resting against her throat, clicking it open to reveal a treasured photograph of herself and Daisy. 

Arabella's expression remained stoic in the image, but Daisy's smile blazed with pure joy. 

Studying her sister's radiant face, Arabella felt an unfamiliar warmth soften her features. 

After their parents' tragic death, Arabella and Daisy had become each other's entire world. Daisy had always been their family's ray of sunshine, illuminating every room she entered. 

At twelve, Arabella had been handpicked by the government for a classified operation that consumed seven years of her life. Now that the mission had concluded, she could finally return to Daisy. 

She had forwarded nearly every government paycheck to her sister, ensuring Daisy lived in comfort and security. 

Joshua's eyes widened in amazement as he witnessed Arabella's smile. 

The legendary ice queen was actually smiling? 

His curiosity about Arabella's sister intensified dramatically. 

The car approached an upscale residential community, where each house boasted its own meticulously maintained garden. 

The vehicle glided to a stop in front of a house. 

This was the home Arabella's parents had bequeathed to them, now shared between Meagan and Daisy. 

The estate glowed with warm light, alive with the sound of cheerful laughter. 

Daisy seemed to be flourishing beautifully. 

With that thought in mind, Arabella preserved her gentle smile as she crossed into the front yard. 

A weathered doghouse sat in the corner of the property. 

Someone knelt beside it in the shadows. 

Through the dim evening light, Arabella couldn't distinguish the person's features, but she watched them scooping food directly from the bowl placed on the ground. 

Why would someone be eating beside the doghouse? 

Concern creased her brow as Arabella approached cautiously. 

The figure appeared startled and scrambled quickly into the doghouse. 

Arabella's bewilderment deepened. Then a soft, trembling voice drifted from within the shelter.

""Please don't strike me again. I won't make any mistakes. I'll be so much more careful...""

That voice belonged to Daisy. 

Arabella's heart shattered instantly. She lunged forward, pulling the figure from the doghouse. Even in the pale moonlight, she recognized her beloved sister immediately. 

Daisy stared back, her eyes swimming with disbelief. ""You..."" she breathed, as though she feared her mind was playing cruel tricks on her. 

""Daisy, is that truly you?"" Arabella's voice trembled with disbelief. 

When Daisy nodded weakly, a glacial fury erupted within Arabella, her eyes igniting with volcanic rage. 

""Bella..."" Daisy whispered, still trapped in shock. ""You've actually come back?""

The moment felt impossibly surreal to Daisy, like a vision conjured from desperate longing. 

Arabella, sensing something terribly wrong, reached out to touch Daisy's forehead. Her skin burned with fever. 

Before Arabella could process this discovery, Daisy crumpled into her arms like a broken doll. 

Arabella cradled her sister, whose body felt heartbreakingly frail and ice-cold despite the raging fever consuming her. 

Arabella's heart crystallized into something harder than diamond. 

The front door of the house suddenly burst open with violent force. 

""Daisy, you worthless creature! It's been several minutes, and you're still not finished eating? Get inside immediately and wash those dishes!"" Meagan's voice sliced through the night air like a bl**e. 

Arabella pivoted slowly, her predatory gaze locking onto her target. 

Meagan had transformed dramatically over the years. 

Once haggard and perpetually exhausted, she now radiated wealth and privilege, adorned in an expensive designer coat and gleaming jewelry that caught the porch light, presenting herself as the very embodiment of refined elegance. 

Meagan's bl**d turned to ice under Arabella's lethal stare. ""You... Arabella? When did you arrive?""

""What have you done to her?"" Arabella advanced with calculated steps, her voice dropping to a menacing whisper. 

Meagan instinctively retreated, unsettled by the predatory intensity burning in Arabella's eyes. But she quickly rallied her confidence, reminding herself that Arabella was still just a young woman. 

She twisted her lips into a cruel sneer. ""Daisy shattered a dish, so I administered appropriate punishment. You've been absent for years. Do you possess any understanding of how challenging life has been here? I never allowed her to starve or sleep without shelter. If you weren't my brother's daughters, I wouldn't have wasted my time with either of you.""

In one fluid motion, Arabella's hand shot out and seized Meagan by the throat, her expression transforming into something carved from arctic stone. 

Meagan ga**ed desperately, clawing at Arabella's iron grip. ""Let... me... go...""

""This is my house,"" Arabella declared, her voice carrying the finality of a death sentence, her eyes radiating lethal intent.

""You forced Daisy to perform menial labor. You made her sleep in that doghouse like an animal. You possess remarkable audacity, Meagan.""

In the warm light streaming from the house, Arabella finally saw what Daisy had been consuming. It was the leftover food. 

Holding her sister, who felt as weightless as a dying bird and appeared ghostly pale and utterly drained, Arabella felt her heart shatter into countless pieces. 

Her precious sister had endured this nightmare! 

""Meagan,"" Arabella said, her voice saturated with deadly promise, ""when you moved into our home, you swore a sacred oath that you would care for Daisy.""

Meagan bristled at Arabella's bold use of her first name, the disrespect cutting deep. 

But she shrank backward when she witnessed the murderous gleam dancing in Arabella's eyes. 

Arabella had always been fundamentally different from other children. She was cold and fearlessly bold. 

When Arabella had lived here, Meagan had performed the role of a dutiful aunt, though barely meeting even the lowest standards. 

But the moment Arabella departed, Meagan had seized absolute control, systematically crushing the gentle-spirited Daisy beneath her cruel authority. 

She had never imagined Arabella would return to witness her crimes. 

""I did take care of Daisy! She made a mistake, so I disciplined her accordingly. What's so terrible about that?"" 

Meagan's words died in her throat as Arabella's grip tightened mercilessly, making her feel as though death itself was reaching for her soul. 

""Arabella?"" The violent commotion finally drew the attention of the people inside. Meagan's husband and daughter noticed the deadly confrontation unfolding at their door. 

Through the wide open front door, Arabella observed them living luxuriously in a spacious and magnificently decorated villa, with a table overflowing with exquisite delicacies.

The people inside wore expensive clothing that spoke of comfort and abundance. 

Meanwhile, Daisy had been sleeping in a doghouse, consuming leftovers. Arabella's eyes burned with unshed tears as the devastating truth crashed over her with overwhelming force. 

Chapter 2 Can You Check Who Made The Payment
Khloe Tucker was fuming. 

""Let go of my mom, Arabella! Back then, she offered to take care of you and Daisy out of kindness. Is that how you repay her? You show up after disappearing for years, acting like you're some kind of hero? What, did you run off, get pr**nant, and have a kid or something? What a joke!""

Khloe threw Arabella a nasty glare, but deep down, she actually hoped Arabella might stay. Having her back would mean more help around the house. 

But Arabella's eyes had already gone cold. Without saying a word, she entered the house and kicked the dining table hard. 

Dishes flew everywhere, crashing onto the floor and shattering into pieces. 

Before anyone could react, Arabella grabbed two vases and hurled them straight at Khloe and her father. 

They hit them squarely, and bl**d started trickling down their faces as they screamed in shock. 

Her voice was ice. ""You've got one day. Get out of my house."" Without waiting for a reply, she stormed out with Daisy in her arms. 

She flagged down the first taxi she saw and rushed her sister straight to a hospital. 

Back at the villa, chaos broke out. 

""Mom! That psycho actually attacked me!"" Khloe sobbed, staring at the scratches on her face in the mirror. ""What if I'm left with scars?""

Meagan's fury boiled over. ""She's gotten way too bold after all these years! If she shows her face again, she won't be so lucky. We're not nobodies anymore. We've joined hands with Norman Group. There's no way she can stand against us!""

She gave Khloe a comforting pat. ""Don't worry, honey. I'm taking you to a hospital right now.""

***

At the hospital, the doctor examined Daisy and frowned. ""Her leg's been broken for a while, and she's covered in bruises. Some of her teeth are missing too. What kind of sister lets this happen?""

Arabella's voice was low. ""It's my fault.""

Her bangs fell over her eyes, hiding whatever she was feeling inside. 

The doctor, noticing how quiet she was, spoke gently. ""I've done what I could for now. But if someone's been hurting you two, you need to report it. Keeping quiet won't fix anything.""

Arabella gave a small nod and moved to stand beside Daisy's hospital bed. 

Daisy, now nineteen, looked heartbreakingly fragile. Her thin frame looked like it couldn't support itself, and her wrists seemed more like twigs than limbs. 

Her short hair was uneven, dry, and choppy, like someone had taken scissors to it without a second thought. 

Arabella gently lifted the blanket, and her heart dropped. 

Daisy's skin told a horrifying story. Old whip marks crisscrossed her legs, and dark burn spots marred her arms.

Each scar screamed of cruelty. Arabella's breath caught, and before she could stop them, tears rolled down her cheeks. 

""Bella..."" Daisy's voice was barely a whisper. 

Arabella immediately reached for her hand. ""I'm here,"" she said softly. 

""I... missed you,"" Daisy murmured, her voice hoarse. 

Arabella clutched her hand like a lifeline. ""I missed you too. I thought if I worked hard, I could give you a better life. But I was wrong. I never should've left you alone. I swear, I'm not going anywhere again.""

The warmth in Arabella's voice seemed to melt Daisy's tension. Slowly, her expression softened. 

After making sure Daisy was settled, Arabella went to sort out the payment. 

""The charges have already been covered,"" the nurse said with a kind smile. 

Arabella blinked. ""What? Who paid?""

Joshua crossed her mind, but she quickly dismissed the thought. There was no way he knew about this yet. 

""Can you check who made the payment?"" she asked. 

The nurse gave an apologetic shake of the head. ""Sorry, that information's private. Maybe a family member helped out?""

At the word family, Arabella's face turned to stone. She gave a short nod and walked off without another word. If someone had helped, she was going to find out who. 

Meanwhile, down the corridor, Meagan strolled beside her daughter, Khloe, who was fresh out of the emergency room with her face patched up. 

""I'm not letting Arabella walk away from this,"" Khloe snarled, bitterness burning in her voice. 

""Calm down,"" Meagan said sharply. ""You'll reopen your stitches if you keep flaring up like this. Be more like your sister--grace under pressure.""

That seemed to cheer Khloe up. A smug smile tugged at her lips.

""As long as my sister keeps shining, that's all that matters. She's the youngest dancer in the Griridge Troupe now. Daisy really thought she could outshine her? She was delusional. That broken leg was karma, if you ask me. And if my sister finds out how Arabella treated me--oh, she'll tear her apart.""

""She's got a big show coming up,"" Meagan reminded her. ""Let's not distract her. One step at a time.""

She tapped Khloe's nose lightly, but then her expression stiffened as she spotted Arabella ahead. 

Khloe saw Arabella too, and just the sight of her brought back the sting of humiliation. Her rage boiled over. 

Without thinking, she grabbed her studded handbag and swung it with all her strength toward Arabella's back. 

Arabella's instincts kicked in. Just as she turned around, a tall man came into view. With quick reflexes and strong arms, he grabbed the bag mid-air by its strap, stopping it like it was nothing. 

The sudden pull made Khloe lose her balance, and with a startled scream, she fell to the floor. 

Chapter 3 Grab Your Things And Come With Me
""Khloe!"" Meagan hurried to her daughter's side, helping her up while shooting a vicious glare at the man who had shown up out of nowhere. 

""Who the h**l are you? Arabella's new guy or what?""

The man didn't bother responding. His sharp eyes gave nothing away, cold and unreadable, like the still, deep sea that hid its danger. 

Then he began walking toward Meagan, each step loud and heavy on the hospital floor. 

Meagan instinctively took a step back. Her ch**t tightened, making it hard to breathe. 

Deep down, something told her this man wasn't just any stranger--he was trouble. 

Trying to mask her unease, she snapped, ""Arabella, you'd better think twice before crossing us again. You and your sister were lucky we let you stay at all! If you ever want back in, come crawling, and maybe we'll consider it.""

Yanking Khloe's arm, Meagan stormed off. 

Arabella stood silently, watching them go. Let them stay? That house was legally Daisy's and hers. 

She glanced at the man and caught sight of a pi**ol, just for a second, before it disappeared beneath his jacket. Her eyes narrowed slightly. 

Who was this guy? 

He turned and looked directly at her. Arabella finally saw his face--handsome as h**l, rough around the edges, and those icy eyes didn't blink or soften for anyone. 

He gave off a vibe that screamed danger--Arabella had never felt anything like it. 

No surprise Meagan bolted--anyone with sense would have. 

""Arabella Stanley,"" he said. His tone was calm and low, but there was a chill in it that made her skin prickle. 

Arabella glanced him over. ""You're the one who paid for my sister, right?""

He gave a faint nod. ""You're quick. Grab your things and come with me.""

Arabella's brows drew together. ""Excuse me?""

Who even was this guy, showing up with mystery and attitude? 

Before things got tenser, another man stepped in--less intimidating but equally serious.

""Miss Stanley, allow me to explain. This is Mr. Asher Gordon. His father and your dad served together in the military. Before his father passed away, he asked Mr. Gordon to watch over your family. Mr. Gordon only recently returned from service and has been trying to track you down since.""

That explained the military presence, the icy calm... the way he moved like someone trained for war. 

Arabella studied Asher again. He didn't seem threatening now, but just closed off, like someone with a wall too thick to climb over. 

She stayed calm. ""You got anything to back that up? Anyone can say that.""

Asher reached into his pocket and pulled out a weathered photo. 

It showed two men in dusty uniforms--one was definitely her father. The other looked a lot like him. 

She stared at it for a long moment before replying, ""I'll think about it.""

""Fair. Let's exchange numbers,"" Asher replied without any small talk. 

Arabella added his contact. His WhatsApp display was just a solid black box. 

Funny enough, hers was the same. 

A strange little coincidence, she thought. 

Then the assistant added her as well. ""Dominick Powell, Mr. Gordon's right hand. Reach out if you need help with anything, anytime.""

Arabella gave a nod. ""Got it.""

With that, the two men walked off, and Arabella made her way back to Daisy's room. 

Shortly after, two silent, suited bodyguards appeared at the door--they were clearly sent by Asher. 

Arabella didn't ask questions. She got to work helping Daisy clean up--changing her into fresh clothes and gently washing her hair, trying to fix its brittle, uneven mess. 

But when she saw the scars and ci**rette burns covering Daisy's body, her eyes welled up again. 

Holding back her tears, she carefully rubbed her homemade cream onto the wounds. Then, without wasting a second, she opened her laptop. 

She had to find out what had happened to Daisy while she was gone, so she hacked into the villa's security system. 

Sadly, what she saw made her sick to her stomach. 

It wasn't long after Arabella left that Daisy was thrown out of her own bedroom and made to sleep in a doghouse. 

The cheerful, lively sister Arabella remembered didn't smile anymore. 

She saw footage of Daisy juggling multiple part-time jobs, only to get ha**ssed and pushed around. 

Even so, she kept working hard and made it into one of the top universities. But during her very first semester, she ended up with a broken leg. 

She was studying dance, and just like that, the injury shattered everything she had dreamed of. 

The pieces fell into place too easily. Khloe's sister, Elissa Tucker, was in the same class. Arabella's gut told her that leg injury hadn't been some fluke. 

After that, Daisy barely left the house. She was treated like hired help, scrubbing floors, cooking meals, and still sleeping out in that d**n doghouse. 

Yet every time Daisy texted her, it was the same lie. ""I'm doing fine. Don't worry about me. You just take care of yourself.""

Arabella's vision blurred. 

While her sister was being broken piece by piece, their aunt's family was thriving. Their business had taken off, thanks to a lucrative deal with the Vanguard Group. 

Khloe, a middle school dropout, was suddenly a digital influencer. Elissa was famous and popular in the college. 

Meagan was rubbing shoulders with high-society ladies, and her husband had become some corporate hotshot. 

Arabella clenched her jaw and slammed her fist against the table. She didn't even feel the sting. 

Every bit of success she had worked for... had only served to feed that vile family's greed. 

And the one person she had sworn to protect had suffered in silence the entire time. 

Chapter 4 This Revenge Is Mine To Carry Out
Arabella took a slow breath, wiped the tears from her cheeks, and her eyes turned cold, like a fire had been snuffed out and replaced with ice.

Her fingers gripped her phone tightly as she made a call. ""That major project--it hasn't been handed over to the Tucker Group yet, right? Cancel it. Completely."" Her voice was calm but firm.

""And get to the Griridge Hospital. Now.""

On the other end, Joshua sounded startled. ""Arabella? What's going on?""

""You'll see when you get here. Bring a few things with you.""

True to form, Joshua didn't waste time. Less than half an hour later, he rushed into the hospital, and the moment his eyes landed on the girl in the hospital bed, he froze like a statue.

She looked so much like Arabella--same face, but all color drained, bruised, battered, her body wrecked like it had been thrown away and forgotten. 

Joshua's fists clenched. ""Who did this? Tell me who it was. I'll make them pay, I swear it!""

That was the sister of a preeminent figure... and they treated her like this? 

Arabella didn't flinch. ""I'll handle it myself. Slowly,"" she muttered, picking up a pair of sc**sors from the table. 

Before Joshua could react, the sc**sors had already cut through her long, silky hair. The strands dropped to the floor in silence. 

He stared, stunned. ""Arabella... you're not actually...""

""I am,"" she said. ""This revenge is mine to carry out.""

Joshua swallowed hard, goosebumps rising on his arms. 

The way she said it--it was clear. H**l was coming for someone. 

Arabella glanced at him. ""Also, what do you know about the Gordons?""

""The Gordon family?"" He immediately straightened. 

""They're legendary. Way beyond the top elite families. Super wealthy, but incredibly discreet. I've only ever worked with the right-hand man of their current CEO.""

""You mean Dominick Powell?"" Arabella asked casually. 

Joshua's jaw dropped. ""Wait, you know Dominick? Don't tell me... are you saying the Gordons were involved in what happened to Daisy?""

Arabella gave him a blank stare before calmly explaining Asher's connection and what he had said earlier. Joshua slapped his thigh, clearly overwhelmed. 

""Asher Gordon? If it's really him, then yeah, no one's faking that. He leads the family. Rumor has it he's ex-special forces, quiet as a ghost, but deadly. If someone crosses him, they don't get a second chance.""

Arabella didn't react. She just stared at the floor, her thoughts turning in circles. 

Then she spoke, steady and cold. ""You should head out now. Also... sell my villa.""

Joshua hesitated. ""That place... that's your parents' home. Are you sure?""

Arabella looked over at Daisy's fragile frame. ""She was tortured in that house. There's no comfort left there. Just get rid of it.""

Her voice cracked slightly. ""And if possible, find a buyer who's impossible to deal with.""

Joshua gave her a long look, then nodded. ""Understood. I've got a bunch of properties lined up. If you ever need a place, it's yours.""

""Thanks.""

She didn't look up, and Joshua, sensing she needed space, quietly slipped out the door. 

Left alone, Arabella gently held Daisy's hand and murmured, ""I swear, everyone who hurt you... I'll make them pay for it tenfold.""

That night felt endless, and sleep didn't come. 

The next morning, Arabella stood quietly outside a dance studio at Griridge University's dance department, listening through the open door. 

""Elissa, things have been so dull without that pathetic girl around,"" someone inside snickered. 

""I know, right? No one to fetch us coffee, no one to mess with. It's no fun without a punching bag,"" another chimed in. 

Peering through the glass window, Arabella spotted Elissa in the middle of the dance studio. 

Years ago, Elissa had been just a pale, skinny kid. Now she was dressed in a flowing white dance outfit, all elegance and grace, like something out of a dream. 

Surrounded by classmates, Elissa flashed a gentle, modest smile at the comments. ""Guys, don't say that. Let's not be mean.""

""You're too kind, Elissa,"" Joyce Lambert, her good friend, scoffed. ""That girl sponged off your family for years. If it were me, I'd have thrown her out of your house on day one.""

Arabella narrowed her eyes slightly. 

Calling it their house? Seriously? 

That place belonged to her and Daisy. Elissa and her family were the ones living off of them. 

Elissa tilted her head, her voice syrupy sweet. ""She's my cousin, after all. Her parents passed away. If we didn't take her in, she would've had nowhere to go.""

Her fake compassion earned gasps of admiration from the crowd. 

What a generous soul, they all seemed to think. 

The loud chatter in the dance studio instantly stopped the moment Arabella walked in. 

""Daisy?"" Joyce blinked in surprise. 

She stared at Arabella, stunned. She looked the same, but... something about her felt different now. 

Chapter 5 Got Yourself A Su**r Daddy
The dance studio fell silent, as if someone had hit pause. 

Every single eye was locked on Arabella, but she acted like she didn't see a thing and confidently made her way to the back, where she began stretching like it was just another day. 

Joyce's jaw clenched. ""Daisy, you've got some nerve showing up out of nowhere like this!"" Joyce barked, marching over and swinging a sharp kick at her.

""Just because we've gone easy on you doesn't mean you're not taking orders from us!""

But Arabella moved with ease, dodging the kick without breaking a sweat. Joyce lost her balance and hit the floor face-first with a loud, painful thud. 

""You dodged me?"" Joyce screeched in disbelief. Her face turned red with fury as she raised her hand to s**p Arabella. 

But just like before, Arabella slipped out of reach like a shadow. Joyce's swing caught nothing but air, and she stumbled forward, grabbing her lower back with a wince. ""D**n it!""

""My bad,"" Arabella said gently, her voice almost too soft to catch. 

Joyce wanted to explode, but something about Arabella's calmness made her hesitate. 

She didn't dare swing again. Instead, she snapped, ""What are you just standing there for? Get over here and help us stretch already!""

""So, Daisy's really back,"" she thought smugly. ""Still the same pathetic errand girl.""

Arabella's gaze briefly darkened, but she gave a polite nod like an obedient student. 

She knelt beside Joyce and began helping her with leg stretches. Joyce smirked. ""You look even sadder than before. Honestly, it's pathetic.""

But then, a painful scream cut through the air. 

Joyce's leg jolted, and she broke into a cold sweat, grabbing her thigh. ""My leg... what the h**l? Did you snap my leg?""

The class crowded around her in a frenzy. 

""Is she alright? Someone call for help!""

""Look, the teacher just walked in!""

Their panic was cut short as the teacher entered the room. 

Arabella still had Joyce's leg in her hands. Calmly, almost casually, she gave it a subtle twist. 

""Ah!"" Joyce screamed even louder, nearly in tears from the pain. 

""What's going on in here?"" The teacher frowned, scanning the chaos. 

""My leg! It feels broken... I can't--"" Joyce wailed, then blinked in confusion. Just seconds later, she could move it again. ""Wait... what?""

""You look fine to me."" The teacher shot a look at Joyce--one that wasn't exactly sympathetic. She had seen enough of these girls' antics over the years.

""I don't care what drama you're cooking up on your own time, but today's important. The Griridge Troupe selection is happening. The dean and senior faculty will be here shortly, so I expect everyone to act like professionals.""

""I swear, I..."" Joyce began, trying to protest. 

""That's enough."" Elissa cut her off, stepping forward with an easy smile. ""Let's not waste more time. Joyce, calm down.""

Elissa's tone made it clear--this wasn't the time to pick fights. 

Joyce had no choice but to bite her tongue and swallow her anger, though her glare at Arabella could have burned through steel. 

The teacher clapped her hands, and class began. 

During the last twenty minutes, a few other teachers showed up to observe. 

By the time class ended, the room was filled with a mix of nervous energy and excited chatter. 

""God, I really hope I get picked. Dancing alongside Elissa would be a dream come true.""

""Elissa, don't forget us when you're famous!"" someone teased. 

Elissa gave her signature angelic smile. ""Of course not. You're all my people.""

Then someone dropped a name that made the entire class go silent. ""They say Isabella might be watching today.""

Gasps rippled through the room. 

Even Elissa blinked in shock, her breath catching. Isabella Wallace was the icon of modern dance. 

Her performances were legendary, her choreography unrivaled. Just being seen by her could open doors. 

""If Isabella notices me, that's it. That's my breakthrough,"" Elissa thought, her gaze sharpening with quiet ambition.

But then someone spoke up, disrupting the mood. ""I saw Daisy dancing earlier. Honestly, she wasn't bad at all.""

Joyce scoffed loud enough for the room to hear. ""Daisy? Please. She's pathetic. No way she'd get picked.""

Turning her attention to Daisy, she said, ""Hey, what are you still doing here, anyway? Go get our lunch. You remember our order, right?""

Without a word, Arabella nodded and walked off, her tall frame moving with a silent elegance despite the slump in her shoulders. 

""Ugh. Even the way she walks is irritating. Does she actually think she's all graceful or something? What a complete eyesore!"" Joyce sneered. 

By the time Joyce, Elissa, and the rest of their group showed up at the cafeteria, laughing and cracking jokes, Arabella already had their meals prepared.

Her eyes quietly scanned each of them--calm, blank, giving nothing away. But in her mind, she was taking note of everything. 

Joyce, whose father ran the Lambert Group, was spoiled beyond belief and filthy rich. 

Next to her was Kenzie Marsh--the meek, glasses-wearing music student who practically worshipped the ground Elissa walked on. 

And behind them, the two guys were followers, plain and simple. They were all muscle without a mind. 

Joyce looked at the food Arabella had bought and narrowed her eyes. ""Well, well. Where'd you get the cash, huh? Got yourself a su**r daddy? I thought you were broke, freeloader.""

Joyce kept running her mouth but still dove into the food--everyone was starving after dancing all morning. 

However, midway through eating, something went terribly wrong. Joyce coughed violently, bl**d trickling from her lips as she clutched her throat, her eyes wide in panic. 

The others followed suit, gasping, hands around their necks, as if something sharp was tearing through their throats. 

""It burns--what's happening?"" they wh**zed, struggling to speak as pain ripped through them. 

Elissa stared at her in disbelief, still holding her throat. ""Daisy... what did you do?""

""That little bi**h's getting revenge!"" Joyce screamed, losing it completely. ""You think Elissa letting you tag along means we'll go easy on you? You're dead!""

Furious, she flung her food tray at Arabella, while the two boys beside her instinctively lunged forward, ready to grab her without hesitation. 

Chapter 6 Do You Have Any Proof
The students nearby were numb to this kind of chaos. 

""Alright, that's enough,"" Elissa said, her voice sounding gentle on the surface but hollow beneath it. 

She stayed comfortably seated, not bothering to step in--after all, she never did when things got ugly. 

Meanwhile, Arabella, calm and collected, didn't even flinch. When the tray came flying her way, she calmly reached up and caught it in one smooth motion. 

The momentum flipped the tray's course, and it slammed straight into one of the two boys' faces. 

The food, laced with slivers of glass, sliced across his skin, and bl**d trickled down his cheek in thin, terrifying lines. ""S**t! That hurts!"" he cried out. 

One look at the bl**d was enough, and he collapsed in panic, completely out cold. 

The other guy didn't back down. Snarling, he reached for Arabella's hair, yanking it hard. ""You think you're tough, Daisy? Huh?""

His fist flew toward her face, but Arabella caught it mid-swing like it was nothing. His expression froze. She slowly twisted his arm until his knees buckled. 

""Ahhh! It hurts--stop, please! I'm sorry!"" he howled, his face turning as pale as chalk. 

The second she let go, he hit the floor and curled into himself, sobbing in pain. 

One of the girls considered helping, but after seeing Arabella in action, she backed off without a word. 

What a bunch of clowns. 

Arabella stared at them, her gaze sharp and cold, like she was looking at tr**h. 

""Have you lost your fu**ing mind?"" Joyce screeched, still in denial. Her hands shook as she picked up a chair and hurled it with all her strength. 

Arabella shifted her weight, spun, and kicked the chair right back--slamming it into Joyce's head. Bl**d splattered instantly. 

Elissa jumped up in horror, shrieking, ""Oh my God!""

The cafeteria exploded with shouts. ""She's gonna k**l someone! Go find a teacher!""

""What is wrong with her? Is she high or something?""

""Honestly, she's kind of a badass...""

""Shh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!""

Thirty minutes later, the university president's office was a pressure cooker. 

The fight was way too intense to sweep under the rug. Daisy, Elissa, and the rest of the group were hauled in for questioning. 

Joyce and the others had been bandaged up, but their egos were just as bruised.

Elissa looked ready to cry, still rubbing her sore throat like it had swallowed fire. She was furious, terrified the damage was permanent. 

""Call your parents,"" the president ordered Arabella sharply, trying to make sense of the madness. ""Now.""

Joyce jumped in before Arabella could speak. ""She can't. Her parents are dead!"" she sneered.

""She's been mooching off Elissa's family for years. No morals. No manners. Just expel her already!""

Taken aback, the president looked Arabella up and down. ""So, what exactly happened?""

Joyce didn't miss a beat. ""She put glass in our food. She tried to hurt us and then went berserk. She needs to face consequences!""

Arabella didn't even blink. Her voice came out calm and cold. ""Do you have any proof? And while we're at it--did I even lay a finger on you first? Pretty sure your side started swinging.""

""Liar!"" Joyce snapped, trying to keep the panic out of her voice. 

Arabella turned her gaze to the president, cool and steady. ""Why don't we pull up the cafeteria security footage?""

Silence dropped like a stone. Joyce's face stiffened, and her jaw clenched tight. ""We only hit her because she gave us food full of glass! She deserved it!""

Arabella tilted her head slightly. ""Where's your proof that I put it there?"" she asked softly. ""Because I have proof of something else.""

She pulled out her phone and tapped the screen. A video began to play. 

The footage was damning. It showed Joyce and her gang shoving a sandwich filled with glass into Daisy's mouth. As Daisy's lips b**d, they laughed like it was some sick joke. 

It was raw and unforgivable. Arabella's ch**t tightened as she watched it, the pain as fresh as the day she found it on Daisy's phone. 

Even the president's face shifted. He turned to Joyce and her friends with a sharp, icy glare. For a split second, panic flashed across their faces. 

Trying to smooth things over, Elissa quickly said, ""Sir, yeah, Joyce went too far, and we're really sorry. But Daisy was talking tr**h first--Joyce just lost her temper.""

Arabella raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. ""Is that so? Well then, I'll just upload this little clip online and let the public decide who the real victim is.""

""Absolutely not!"" the president barked. ""Miss Stanley, if that video gets out, it'll drag the university through the mud. Let's not blow this out of proportion. Apologize to each other, and we'll call it even.""

Joyce looked outraged. ""What? She beat the crap out of us! Why should we just let it go?""

Her friends chimed in, just as outraged. 

Meanwhile, Elissa leaned toward the president and whispered with a sweet smile, ""My dad's set to donate $1 million to the school. Just thought you should know.""

The president's expression shifted. His tone changed. 

""Daisy,"" he began, ""what they did was wrong. But your response was excessive. This could've been handled differently. You can either apologize now and move forward, or you'll be expelled. And if you upload that video, trust me, public opinion won't be on your side. That would be reckless.""

Arabella stared at him. So that was what this was. 

Now she understood why Daisy had been stepped on for so long. 

These people weren't protecting students--they were protecting their pockets. 

Joyce, smelling victory, leaned back with a smug grin.

""Daisy, you really thought you had the upper hand? You're nothing but a parasite clinging to Elissa's family like a leech. Don't act like you matter. You want to stay here? Then get on your knees and l**k my shoes clean. Maybe, just maybe, I'll let you off the hook.""

Joyce looked at Arabella like she wasn't even human. 

Elissa didn't say anything at first, but the fire burning behind her calm expression gave her away. Her throat still hurt, and what bothered her more was the embarrassment. 

Deep down, she wanted to lash out at Arabella. But on the outside, she just let out a quiet sigh, like she was more hurt than mad. 

""Daisy, I honestly don't know what happened to you,"" she said. ""But if you can't apologize to us, then pack your things. You're no longer welcome in my home.""

The president didn't bat an eye. ""That's enough. You're done here. Pack up and get out."" He waved Arabella off like she was a fly in the room before turning to Elissa with a tight smile. ""You're injured. Go rest. We'll take care of everything.""

Joyce smirked, finally feeling like the universe had balanced itself. With their heads held high, they all moved to strut out like they had won a prize. 

""Quite the scene,"" came a calm voice from the doorway, all eyes turned. 

Arabella raised an eyebrow. How was he here!

1mluhf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mluhf7/what_i_know_now_after_meeting_someone_who_was_my/,what I know now after meeting someone who was my “person”,"I’m in my mid twenties. I’ve recently figured some stuff out about dating that I couldn’t conceptualize as a teenager, & when I was stretching myself to find someone who liked me. 

This last year I met someone who could have been my “person”. We dated for 5 months, then I left the country to live elsewhere for two years. We did two months in person, 3 LD. Then we parted ways. I believe this could have been my “person” if I stayed in my home country, but I’m young and life has other plans. 

I know you’re thinking “you broke up how are they your person?” They were for that period of my life. We’re constantly growing, changing and entering into new chapters. He was my person then, but this experience showed me that there is authentic love out there & I can find it again.

Here’s some things I learned. I’m deliberately single now until I notice these things again. 

1. It will feel magnetic. Our first date was sharing book recommendations over coffee. When we were talking, our hands just found each other under the table. It was the most natural thing. 

2. You will feel eerily calm. In the past I would have said I’m an anxious dater. I worried about everything before my person. How long it took someone to text, my appearance, if they liked me, when we would meet, how long between dates. I was always anxious. When I met my person, this disappeared. 

3. You will not feel uncertain. We were instantly on the same page, our values, what we value in character, the pace of our relationship. I had zero doubts about this persons feelings about me, and I wasn’t doubting myself. 

4. You will have amazing physical chemistry. Hands down best sex of my life. My person & I had a physical attraction I had never experienced before. It totally changed my relationship with sex & my body. 

5. You will want to become a better person. When I was with my person, I felt like I was understanding who I was at my core. This is because they saw me as a full person, & wanted to meet me at my center. I was kinder, sweeter, softer & more honest— because these were the qualities my person had. 

6. They will be your role model. When I had relationship problems with my friends, family, or difficult days at work. I would ask myself “what would my person do?” Their character inspired me. 

7. Eye contact is addicting. My favorite thing was to just stare into his eyes. It really felt like soul on soul contact. This was always something I avoided in the past because it was too vulnerable for me. 

8. Your feelings will spill out of your mouth. Before meeting my person I simply couldn’t communicate my feelings. In the past for me this looked life stifling my needs & wants and pretending everything was OK. With my person, I felt like I was unable to lie to him. When we talked about our problems, they didn’t feel like my problem or his problem, just something we were solving and untangling carefully together. 

9. If you break up, love is changed forever. Me & my person parted ways. I can honestly say this is the first time I experienced real love that had potential to last a lifetime. We broke up because of distance, I live a completely different life than him. But I will forever be grateful for him, I now know what it feels like when a relationship is right for you. 

10. “You already know what you’re going to do” is a quote form Fleabag and I think it applies to dating. I think when you meet someone, you already know your potential for connection with them. If you are anxious, tense, closed off, or dishonest. That is not your person. I will even be controversial and say it doesn’t have to do with attachment styles or past trauma. A pure love makes those things irrelevant when you are first meeting someone. ",2,1754758974.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

For perspective - that would mean the total supply of bitcoin would be worth

A quadrillion?

That’s crazy talk. Hopefully. But that would mean the price of a bread would be through the roof

Rough esitmates say there’s only 2.4 billion US dollars - everything else is made up imaginary dollars and debt.

But if you take saylor predictions and divide it by current usd - it’s 50,000 times higher

And if there’s a sliding scale 

So that could translate in a current $5 cup of coffee costing a quarter of a million dollars. (Currently roughly the value of 2 bitcoin)

Ridiculous.

I say all of that to say - as many of you know - Bitcoin can’t be equated to dollars 

So what stick do you use to measure the value of Bitcoin?

Bitcoin vs the price of a gallon of gasoline?

1mluepm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/1mluepm/can_we_buy_windows_without_supporting_awful/,Can we buy windows without supporting awful business model?,"Hi guys,

I hate upselling and sleazy sales tactics. 

Mercifully, these have mostly fallen by the wayside thanks to the transparency brought by the internet. But some still remain - as I discovered this morning. 

I need new patio doors. My existing patio doors have a problem with the locking mechanism. They will only open if shaken extremely violently. Clearly, they are going to fail at some point soon - and when they do, the house will not be secure.

Anticipating this, I want a very simple like-for-like replacement. Two doors opening outwards, white uPVC, straightforward lock. About as simple as you can get.

I went online and found Safestyle, Anglian and Everest (who I have now learned are all the same company) do not offer transparent, off the peg pricing . You must instead accept a visit from a salesman. 

Having slogged my way through various such experiences, I was very reluctant to accept this. I needed patio doors however, so made an agreement with Safestyle for a quote. There was an MS Teams option instead, which I thought would be far easier to control.

Ten minutes before we were due to begin, the area manager called and said the salesman happened to be in my area, so would I accept a face to face visit? Against my better judgment, I said yes.

The salesman came. I opened the door and invited him in. Before entering, he handed me a laminated piece of paper. It turned out to be an enlarged Trustpilot review praising him as a salesmen. I smiled and handed it back to him. He said ‘no, you have to read it before I come in’. I paused for half a second, did so out loud, and thought ‘here we go’.

I offered him tea or coffee, sought to establish a rapport, and sat down -  but also explained I was looking for a very simple replacement of like-for-like white uPVC doors. I explained I worked previously in sales and wanted to save him time - I really only wanted a quote.

For 15 minutes he went through a spiel, while I politely reminded him we were looking for a price. We had to go through the whole theatre of identifying what our priorities were, with each one having a manipulative emotional tug attached - draft exclusion to protect the environment, security to protect our beautiful children and so on. 

I repeatedly said I was looking simply for a quote - and he said yes, but I have to see what I can get for you (which I interpreted as ‘…from you’).

He then began to disparage Chinese and EU windows as lesser quality (which is nonsense - EU standards in particular are equal to Britain’s not least because Britain inherited its standards from the EU).

After several more minutes of unnecessary nonsense he said ‘ok, I’m going to give you a number and you tell me how far it is from your expectation’.

He produced a number on his laptop.

Six grand.

Six grand for a single patio door.

I smiled and said I think we have mismatched expectations.

He pressed a button and the six immediately became a five.

I said we had different expectations.

He asked me what I expected to pay.

I said a thousand. He said no - there wouldn’t be any profit in a grand.

I said fine. 

He then pressed a button again, and the price magically became two grand.

We had gone down by 67% in three minutes.

I invited him to send the quote by email, and brought matters to a close.

The thing is, I do need a patio door. But I really, really don’t want to support a business model like this.

Is it actually possible to buy patio doors in the UK without having to go through this sleaziness, where scummy salesmen try to milk the naivety or innocence of consumers?

Is there not such a thing as off-the-peg pricing, where I can choose between transparently and fairly priced options?

Has anyone else done this, without having to support men such as this?

1mludq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mludq9/boss_fired_me_for_making_a_comment_about_trans/,Boss fired me for making a comment about trans people,"I got fired yesterday from my paralegal job for a very f’ed up reason. Here’s what happened. 

So I worked in this very small law office. It was just me and the boss (the lawyer) . He was an older married guy, I’m single. He used to flirt with me pretty regularly but never crossed lines - although he did take me out to lunch once. On Monday , we were having a conversation about transgender people (not sure why?) and I explained to him I thought it was so great they’re accepted in society as it’s a tough life . I told him I know because I myself went through a cross dressing phase /gender confusion as a teen. Anyway , after I told him this, he shoots me this glare/look of disapproval, clearly *very* disturbed by what I said. Like how could I, this flirty very feminine young woman, have gone through a phase like that?? Then, he changes the subject immediately and asks me where the copies of one of our clients’ file are as he needs the file “right now.” We went from friendly chit chat to where you could feel the hate in the air in under 5 minutes. 

The rest of the day he was exceptionally unfriendly/cold and when the phone rang he yelled from his office (something he never did before) to “answer the Goddamn phone) while saying something under his breath about what a terrible employee I was” .

Tuesday, the unfriendliness continued with more of “get me my fucking coffee” and “answer the goddamn phone” yelling . He also told me I wasn’t working efficiently enough when I was working at the same pace I had worked before when he was flirting with me BEFORE I had said my comment. 

Oh and by the way - before my comment- he used to be talking to me ALL the time. That’s why the unfriendliness was so out of character. 

So Wednesday this piece of s#!t randomly brings in a new girl to “help out” our office since work isn’t getting done apparently?? She was really cold to me and he made a comment to her about how we have some weird clients, some of which are trans and it’s “just weird” . She agreed with him and they went to a private lunch but I wasn’t invited, at all. I admit, I had a feeling I was gonna get fired that day. 
Instead , I got fired on Friday after I refused to wash his dishes . He claimed that was part of my job duties and I said it wasn’t. I had never done his dishes before, ever. Anyway. We got in quite an argument about it with him asking me “who the hell do I think I am?” There was so much anger in his voice, it was disgusting. I could tell this guy HATED me . When I got back from lunch, he did the deed. During the firing he tells me  “it’s a small office here and we don’t get along very well and it’s becoming a problem” I literally told him “WTf?? Last week we were talking for over 1/2 the day. Last week you were sharing with me your weekend plans, and we were laughing , and you were telling me I should try out this beautiful hiking trail , how can you say we don’t get along??“ and he’s like “you really have to leave, it’s not appropriate you work here”. Not appropriate?? Yeah … because you can’t effectively flirt with me anymore after the comment I made 🙄 Got that. 

So yeah… I’m pretty sure I got fired because of my comment I made regarding my trans phase and that changing his view of me . Guy is clearly anti trans BIG TIME and has a problem with women who didn’t grow up feeling like women . Because that’s when everything definitely changed. He never flirted with me again after my comment. And this guy used to flirt with me almost daily. 

The whole thing reminded me of when one of these ass holes I met on a dating app decided he didn’t want to see me anymore after I made a comment about my ex. Like … I don’t Understand these guys who u say one thing to them and that’s it, you’re on their “list” and must be gotten rid of immediately . I don’t get that mentality at all. But I think it shows what a worthless pos these people are .. you know … true colors come out when you provoke them. And my boss didn’t want to flirt with someone who he knew went through a trans phase. Period. 

I’m really upset because I’m unemployed though when I didn’t deserve to be. I always did my work and was a really good employee. But I guess he’s allowed to fire me for any reason? But Is what this guy did even legal?? I mean, looking back I see what a clearly toxic place that was, but I’m just like, dude, u literally turned on me for no reason and fired me for saying I had a trans phase … like wtf?? That is so f’ed up!! Kind of wondering has anyone else ever experienced anything like this?",0,1754758729.0,jobs,43,0.48,False

1mlu8ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mlu8ao/hr_my_last_patient_at_the_metal_hospital/,[HR] My Last Patient At The Metal Hospital,"Between 1989 and 1997 I was a shrink at the Great Oaks Mental Hospital, back when Great Oaks was a thriving community before mystery and tragedy turned it into the ghost town it is today. There are plenty of stories that I could share from my time at Great Oaks Mental Hospital but there is one that I will never forget, every detail. I wouldn’t even have to look back on my notes. 
	I have changed any pertinent information, names, birthdates, and any other unimportant personal details to avoid breaking HIPAA laws. Not that I’m sure that’s a concern anymore. The patient has been dead for some time and that is probably for the better, if I’m being honest.
	He was the last patient I saw at the facility. I’d like to say he wasn’t the reason why I left but I’m not sure that is true. I was used to seeing five to ten patients a week being one of five therapists of varying official titles but by the time I saw this man, we’ll call him Peter, he was my only patient.
	The town hadn’t started dying yet but the effects were beginning to blossom at the Mental Hospital. In later years the hospital would be considered ground zero for all the crazy and weird things that would over run the town as a whole. But that is all in due time. For now our focus is Peter. 
	Like I said he was my only patient, due to some unfortunate circumstances, unfortunate stories, and even more unfortunate losses families stopped admitting family members to Great Oaks Mental Hospital opting to go to facilities farther away but more “reliable.”
	This was one of many conversations we had. They were almost always the same which helps me remember the details even though I would never forget them.
	
	“Why don’t you tell me what happened?” I asked him as he sat across from me. The room was bright. Brighter than normal. He requested blinds open and all the lights on. Eventually it wasn’t enough and I had to double the number of lamps in my office. The nurses said he started with a night light, by this time the overhead light in his room was on 24/7.
	“Why should I? We’ve done this before. We have the same conversation every week.” He said dejected. He was also correct. This was how we started the last session of every week. It was tedious and repetitive but it was the job. It was also the point in the week that he was most open and most willing to talk about his experience.
	“Yes we have talked about it but talking about it will help.” I told him reassuringly. He was an uneasy man, some would say broken, and that was no surprise either. You don’t end up in a mental hospital because you’ve got life figured out.
	At least Peter wasn’t. Before becoming a patient at our facility he was a successful lawyer married to a lovely lady, let’s say Sarah, who had planned on being a stay at home mother.
	“Talking hasn’t helped. Not with you not with anyone else.” He said not making eye contact. He never made eye contact with me. He stared off into space, mostly at the floor or out the window. Until we got into his story. Every time we got into details he would stare at the corner of my office. “Talking won’t help.” He continued. “Not when no one believes me.”
	“Why do you think no one believes you?” I asked. I made sure to keep my opinions as a professional neutral I never gave him any indication that I didn’t believe him. Even though I didn’t, not yet anyway.
	“I know when people don’t believe me.” He said matter-o-factly. “You don’t believe me. The last lady didn’t believe me. The grievance counselor I saw before coming here didn’t believe me. I don’t blame you. I know I sound crazy. But what I am saying is true.” His face was still, stern, as if it were carved from stone. Peter wasn’t an emotional man. Not by the time he became my patient.
	“Peter.” I said gently but couldn’t pull eye contact. “No one has ever said they don’t believe you. You’re just assuming they don’t-”
	“No! I know no one believes me.”
	“How? How are you so sure?” I asked quizically. This was the first sign of emotion he had shown me in weeks. Even as a professional I was still a little surprised. He had been a patient for almost three years even though he had only been my patient for about nine months and in those three years he had only been angry twice. His previous therapist had notes on him being sad, scared, remorseful, depressed but never angry. The first time he had shown anger was when a nurse told him he couldn’t leave his lights on and the night light would have to suffice. “How can you be sure?” I prompted again when he didn’t answer.
	“He told me.”

*

	The story Peter told me repeatedly was outlandish, unbelievable, and horrifying. It would’ve made for a great campfire story if the man who was telling it didn’t believe it whole heartedly. Even though it was an unbelievable story that he had told to multiple different therapists over years the details stayed the same. Exactly the same. Every set of patient notes used the same wording describing the same experience beat for beat. This is the story as I remember it.

	“Hey babe do you remember about two months ago when we went camping?” Sarah asked Peter plopping down on the couch next to him.
	“Yes. It was a great time.” He said with a smile setting down the thick file he had been reviewing. 
	“Something came back with us.” She said trying her best to hide her smile.
	“What do you mean? Like a bug or a possum or something? It’s been two months and you just found it?” He asked shifting uneasily in his seat. He loved the outdoors but wasn’t very fond of the things that lived in the woods they frequently camped in. Sarah was the spider killer of the family.
	“Okay, maybe not something.” She said easing him immediately. “But a someone.” She grinned revealing the positive pregnancy tests she had been hiding.
	Peter was over joyed. He had been made partner at his law firm the year before and after being married for four years the promotion was all they were waiting for to start trying for kids. It took a little longer than he thought, with the lack of sexual education he had grown up with he figured the first time without birth control would’ve been enough.
	“I can’t believe it.” He nearly wept as he kissed her. “This is great!”
	Things were as you would expect from expecting parents. Peter painted the nursery and built a crib. Sarah looked through catalogs for baby clothes and toys. The morning sickness was almost non existent but the cravings were in full force. He had caught her eating peanut butter straight from the jar using a pickle spear as a spoon, topped her vanilla ice cream with mild hot sauce, and once half a can of sardines which she was previously disgusted by. Every time he caught her sneaking her special treats he would laugh it off. Happy to see her happy.
	“You know they say you can learn the sex of the baby before its born these days.” Peter’s grandmother said one day early in the third trimester. “Wouldn’t that be fun.” She smiled sweetly as she looked out of the window of her nursing home.
	“I think it might be fun to keep it a surprise.” Peter said refilling his grandmother’s tea. They loved spending time with her, Peter wanted to move her in with them but their starter home was too small and was about to get smaller.
	“Oh come on Peter, wouldn’t it be cool to know? Be able to prepare?” Sarah asked excitedly. Peter really did want to wait. Even though he wouldn’t admit it out loud he wanted a boy and finding out early that he would get a girl might be disappointing.
	“We can ask the doctor at the next appointment.” Peter said with a smile.


*

	“Any more questions?” Their doctor asked as the appointment was finishing up. Everything checked out, a healthy baby and healthy mother made for a happy father.
	“Just one.” Sarah said as she sat up. “We were wondering about a test to check the sex of the baby.” She said grinning with excitement.
	“Ah yes.” The doctor said as he made a final note in the records he was keeping. “That is becoming more common these days. More reliable too. Seems that expecting parents are too excited to wait. ‘Specially first timers.” The old man explained sitting back down in his rolling stool.
	“Is it complicated? Any concerns?” Peter asked. He was always the realist of the two.
	“No, no. It’s perfectly safe. A simple blood test. I can do a draw now and send it out to the lab. You would have results in a week or two. I’ll have them mailed to your house. That way if you change your mind, just don’t open the envelope.” His voice was deep and soothing it gave them comfort. “The only hitch would be that it isn’t covered by insurance. Not yet anyway. I’m sure the test will be in the future as it becomes more common but right now you would have to pay out of pocket. About three hundred dollars.” 
	Sarah gave Peter a puppy-dogged look that she knew would melt his heart. “Let’s do it.” He said knowing he wouldn’t be able to say no.
	A week later the results showed up in their mail box. Excitedly Sarah pulled the envelope from the mailbox and left it perched on the kitchen table for when Peter got home. 
	“Ready?” He asked after dinner still sitting at the table.
	“I don’t know. I’m nervous.” She explained but he thought she looked more giddy than nervous.
	“We can wait. How’s another four months sound?” Peter joked as he slid the envelope to her. “I’ll let you do the honors.”
	She snatched up the envelope and ripped the edge open without hesitation. She looked at Peter and withdrew the page inside with slow suspense. She cleared her throat unfolding the paper. Then her face dropped.
	“This can’t be right.” She said it so quietly that he had a hard time hearing her.
	“What’s wrong?” Peter asked with a concerned look.
	“It’s… It’s…”
	“A boy?” He asked to no response, not that he gave her much time to respond before asking. “A girl?”
	“It’s blank.” She said said still staring at the paper.
	“Like the test didn’t work?”
	“No like the whole paper is blank.” She said turning it to him revealing nothing but blank white space.
	“Weird.” He said surprised to hear the disappointment in his voice. “We have another appointment next week we can ask the doctor for the results then. I’m sure the results were sent to them too.” He said comforting her. She was disappointed but agreed.

*

	“Everything still checks out. Right as rain.” The doctor said washing his hands.
	“That’s great news. I’ve been worried since we got the results from our test.” Sarah said knowing that this would news to both the doctor and her husband.
	“Why was there something concerning about the sex of the baby?” The doctor asked turning his attention towards her. 
	“It’s nothing. They just mailed us a blank piece of paper.” She explained trying to hold back tears.
	“We were hoping you’d have the results. Maybe it was an error when they were mailing it to us.” Peter interjected.
	“Yes. They sent the results here as well. One of the office lady’s would’ve added it to your file. I haven’t had a chance to look for myself but I should be able to find it here.” He said as he started to shuffle through the folder. “Hmh. Seems the results were inconclusive. That happens from time to time nothing to worry about. The tests have become more reliable but that doesn’t mean they are guaranteed.”
	After a few days the melancholy of the undetermined results had passed and things were back to normal better than normal, Sarah was over the moon that morning when she felt the baby kick. They had thought the baby had kicked before but never like this.
	“Feel this baby!” She squealed pushing her belly towards him as he poured his cup of coffee. He put a hand to her stomach and felt kicks, several of them, very hard. There was no doubt this time the baby was active.
	“Whoa quite a kick there kid.” He said to her bloated belly. “We could have a running back on our hands.” He smiled up at her.
	“Babe.” She laughed back at him.
	“Or at least a kicker. Someone’s going to have to take care of us when were old and if he makes it to the NFL that would be no problem.” Peter said jokingly.
	“It could still be a girl.” Sarah reminded him. She had become okay with waiting to find out the gender. Actually she was excited by the surprise.

*

	The day of the labor started out like any other, Sarah stayed home feet up knowing the baby would come any day if not any minute. Peter went to work already alerting his bosses that he might have to leave at a moments notice.
	He didn’t have to though, to his surprise, he made it home in time for dinner before the labor started. They rushed out the door and he almost forgot their go bag.
	“I got it.” He huffed as he plopped back down into the drivers seat.
	“Good lets gooooo.” Sarah squealed.
	The drive was quick and they were prepping for birth before they knew it. The birth wouldn’t come quickly though they spent hours sitting in the quiet room Sarah fighting through contractions and Peter their holding her hand the whole time.
	“Let’s play ball.” The doctor said taking his position between Sarah’s legs. Peter couldn’t help but think he looked like a catcher behind home plate.
	Sarah screamed as the delivery began and Peter could only assume that was normal. 
	“Good, Good. Keep pushing, Sarah.” The doctor said calmly from his position. 
	The calm nature of the doctor didn’t ease Peter’s worry as Sarah’s scream grew louder her squeeze on his hand tighter. In fact the relaxed nature of the doctor unsettled him as the doctor spoke. Now Peter couldn’t hear what the man was saying over his wife’s screaming. Her cries for help, begging to be released from the pain. 
	This wasn’t right. He knew this wasn’t right. There was no way this was how delivering a baby worked. She was too panicked, in too much pain even for having a baby. The doctor was too calm. 
	“Sir, we need to clear the area.” One of the nurses said leading him away from his wife.
	“Wha-what?” He said confused. “No. What’s happening? I’m not going anywhere.” But his pleas were ignored and the nurse shuffled him to the corner of the room. Then everything went quiet. He wasn’t sure how long he was left in the silence while the medical staff worked behind the curtain that was pulled closed.
	“Congratulations you sir have a nice healthy boy.” The doctor said when he emerged from behind the curtain. He held a rather large baby wrapped into a tight bundle. “Would you like to hold him?” He said holding the baby out to Peter.
	“Yes. How’s Sarah doing? Can I see her?” He asked reaching for his child.
	“She did good. She’s sedated and sleeping now. The boy was big so it was a little more complicated but everything is fine now.” He said in his usual demeanor that set Peter mind to rest. He took his son from the doctor and looked into his boys face for the first time.
	“What the hell is this?” He barked. What was staring back at him wasn’t staring at all. I was a stark white, smooth, featureless face. “This isn’t a child.” He barked but when he looked up there was no one there. No doctor, no nurses, not even his wife. He was alone in their room with this thing. 
	He dropped the baby and backed away from it. When he did so the bundle wrapped around the baby fell loose. The baby landed on his hands and feet. Or rather his hands and hooves because from the waist down the baby closer resembled the ass end of a donkey while the top half was white as snow and smooth as butter.
	The baby-thing scuttered across the room then turned to look at him. This time it did actually look at him. It struggled at first but after a few test blinks the baby-things skin tore free with a sickly ripping sound that made Peter’s blood run cold. It made indistinguishable guttural throat noises at him as if it was trying to talk to him.
	Peter wanted to run for the door every bit of his instinct was urging him to leave the room but he couldn’t take his eyes off of it. Then as quickly as it settled in his hypnotic state broke and he burst through the door leaving the thing all alone.

*

	“And that’s exactly how you remember it?” I would ask him when his recounting was over.
	“Yes. I’m not lying.”
	“No one has accused you of lying.” I would remind him.
	“No but no one would if they thought so.” He countered never skipping a beat.
	“Would you?” I asked him at our last session. I had decided that session that this would be my last day. Not only at the hospital but in the career. Therapists often partake in therapy themselves I was never one of those therapists. Maybe I should have been. Maybe it would have kept me in the job longer but knowing what came after this session its probably for the best that I didn’t. So I was at the end of my rope. Burnt out and ready to move on. It might be unprofessional but it left me the opportunity to be completely open, upfront, and honest. I could finally start digging without having my hands tied behind my back.
	“Would I?” He repeated finally making eye contact.
	“Would you think that you were lying? Would you believe your story if someone else told it to you?”
	He thought for a second. “Now I would. But I’m biased.”
	“And you don’t think that these memories, the way you think it happened, are a coping mechanism for what really happened?” I asked loosening up a bit.
	“That is what really happened.” He retorted. Now he wasn’t breaking eye contact and I missed all those hours of him staring at the floor.
	“No.” I said bluntly. “What really happened.” I paused I knew none of this was new information to him but it was the touchiest of subjects. “What really happened was the child birth was very complicated. Too complicated.” I softened my tone. “Sarah died while giving birth and shortly after that so did your child. Peter, you lost your family in the matter of minutes. That’s very traumatizing and people react to trauma in strange ways.” 
	“I was there. I know what happened. I saw that demon for myself. I never saw my wife again. They took her. Because of what she birthed.”
	“Peter that isn’t true.” 
	“Yes it is!” He screamed before storming out of the room.
	I stayed for a while after that. I finished my patient notes, packed my things, and wrote my resignation letter. I slipped it under my bosses door when I left for my lunch break knowing I would never be back.
	It wasn’t long after that I decided to pack my bags and move out of Great Oaks entirely. I didn’t go far just a few towns away. I ran into an old co-worker after the town started what would be its inevitable collapse. That was another conversation I won’t forget.
	After the niceties were done she leaned close to me. “Did you hear what happened to Peter?” She asked in a hushed tone.
	“Peter? No I haven’t heard anything.” I was surprised she was bringing him up. I hadn’t thought about Peter for a few years. Now I think about him every day. “What happened?”
	“He hung himself from his shower rod.” She whispered.
	“What? When?” I asked in complete shock. He had never shown signs of suicidal tendencies. As far as the patients at Great Oaks Mental Hospital Peter was lucid and logical, which was better than most. His problems were believed to be paranoia and hallucinations potentially schizophrenic.
	“1999. June, I think.” Then she asked me a question I wasn’t expecting. “Remember his story?” 
	“Who could forget it?” I said with more sarcasm than I would’ve liked. I should’ve guessed that this lady had picked him up as a patient when I left. There were only two therapists left.
	“Did he tell you about the thing in the room?”
	“When his wife died? Yes of course.”
	“No I mean during sessions.” She explained.
	“I’m not sure what you mean.” I said genuinely confused.
	“He told me during his sessions, whenever he got into the details of that night, the demon baby thing was in the room with us.”
	“What?” I asked more as an involuntary reaction than anything else.
	“Yeah he said it would sit in the corner of the room just listening before it waived a disappeared.”

Here are some recurring patterns I’ve noticed:

	•	Community Clannishness 

Many don’t integrate. They form tight bubbles, only socializing, hiring, and doing business with other Indians. Outsiders are often seen as irrelevant unless they’re useful.

	•	Exploiting Fellow Immigrants 

Underpaying employees, shady “referral” schemes in IT, and quick to take advantage of other newcomers.

	•	Pyramid Schemes & Fake Friendships 

Common to get “invited” to coffee or dinner, only to be pitched Amway, Herbalife, or some other MLM.

	•	Corruption Carried Over

Cutting corners, exploiting loopholes, bending rules — from fake resumes to visa fraud — often seen as “just smart business.”

	•	Sexism & Casteism 

Many hold onto backward attitudes: looking down on lower castes, treating women as second-class, marrying only within their caste or community.

	•	No Respect for Boundaries

Gossip, intrusive questions, and zero sense of privacy, even with casual acquaintances.

	•	Double Standards

Love the benefits of America (freedom, equality, rule of law) but expect people to follow Indian social hierarchies when dealing with them.

This isn’t all first-gen Indians, but the patterns are too common to ignore. If you’ve lived in areas with a large Indian immigrant population, you’ve probably seen some (or all) of this.

In-Depth Review,"There’s something inherently satisfying about getting the job done efficiently, and the **DeWalt DCF891Q1 20V 1/2IN MID-RANGE IMP WRENCH KIT** aims to deliver just that. I recently got my hands on this power impact wrench and have been testing it extensively. From assembling furniture to tackling a few stubborn bolts on my car, I put it through its paces. This tool certainly made my life easier, though it came with a few quirks worth sharing.

**Built to Last**  
Sturdy and durable, this mid-range impact wrench is made with a blend of high-quality materials. As soon as I unboxed it, the brushed finish caught my eye, and the overall construction gave off a premium vibe. Holding it in my hands, it felt well-balanced, a feature that became evident after working with it for extended periods. Despite weighing roughly 3.76 kilograms, the ergonomic design compensated well, distributing the weight evenly and reducing wrist strain.  

[Check the DeWalt DCF891Q1 price on Amazon.](https://toolgalaxy.com/p/b0c2dnpv1d/)

**Power and Performance**  
I used this cordless wrench to remove some rusted lug nuts from an old trailer sitting in my backyard—it handled the task with ease. The battery-powered operation provided a reliable source of torque without needing to fuss with cords. Featuring mid-range power, this model doesn’t scream heavy-duty, but for routine jobs, its strength was more than adequate. However, when I tried loosening some larger industrial bolts, it struggled a bit, which reminded me that its target audience leans more toward home DIYers than industrial workers.

**Highlights**  
- Requires no cords, with efficient 20V battery-powered operation.  
- Ergonomically designed for comfort during long usage.  
- The well-built exterior and hex head style scream durability.  
- Works excellently on everyday tasks like small to mid-sized bolts.

**Battery Life: A Mixed Bag**  
I’d call the battery life a double-edged sword. On one hand, it charges surprisingly fast, getting to full power while I grabbed a coffee. However, the runtime left my projects hanging if I forgot to have a secondary battery charged. For most smaller jobs, the single battery in the kit was sufficient; heavy-duty users might need to invest in extras.

**Critiques**  
- Struggled with heavy-duty tightening/loosening jobs.  
- Battery life may disappoint power users.  
- Noisy during operation, compared to some competitors.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
When you start comparing it to other options in the market, the pricing falls in line with mid-range tools that promise similar performance. While it might not be the most budget-friendly option out there, the quality of materials and ease of use make up for the difference. If you’re a DIYer or casual user looking for reliability, it’s probably worth your cash. Just ensure you’re not expecting heavy-duty industrial-grade performance.

Sometimes our focus is diverted from deeply thinking about our platonic friendships and whether they are good for us, as they can become a source for personal unhappiness. Bad friendships can be flying under the radar in lieu of spending our mental energy analyzing our workplace/familial/romantic relationships. Just like a romantic relationship can be bad for us because it ends up becoming abusive....that can also happen with our platonic friendships. We need to give ourselves the grace to leave those friendships when they become harmful to our happiness and mental well-being.

I'm an old millennial and I think one of the best things I ever did as I got older (with time we get wiser) was dropping emotional vampire people from my life...these so-called friends.... like they were super heated potatoes. Emotional vampires (also called energy vampires) are really good at finding and befriending empathetic & genuinely nice/helpful people. Like if your natural inclination or love language is 'acts of service'....you are catnip to an emotional vampire. If you have to mentally prepare yourself to be a counselor/life coach/therapist to friends FOR HOURS as they talk about the latest messed up drama in their life, then you are friends with an emotion/energy vampire. If you only barely get in a word about yourself and your own life because they dominate the conversation or always bring the conversation back to themselves, congrats you are friends with a vampire. If they play the game of ""misery Olympics"", as in they try to one-up-you when it comes to you trying to share a stress in your life, then you are talking with an energy vampire. I 100% used to feel so exhausted like I donated 3 pints of blood after every encounter with my ex-vampire friends.   
  
Funny thing is that once I extracted myself from this type of friend, I realized they entire time that I was the only one doing emotional labor. Big red flag now that I see it. Since dropping this type of person, my personal happiness has turned around once I got over the sunk cost fallacy of keeping toxic people around just because I had known them for years. Now I feel so much better going out, as I have a better curated set of friends. I feel energized with them instead of feeling depressed/exhausted following a social gathering.   
  
How I did that for years is crazy to think about. When I was in my 20s and 30s I was a bit of a pushover due to wanting to help everyone feel welcomed and comfortable in social settings. Who doesn't want to help out their friends with personal issues, right? That always struck me as the right thing to do....not realizing that it can become toxic. Being too empathetic, I learned, also needs to come with a strong backbone in order to not be taken advantaged of by those who want to suck out your energy like a parasite. Strong boundaries need to be made to prevent you from always playing the life coach/therapist and allow you to disengage, and it will absolutely prevent the parasitic type of people from trying to hang onto you.   
  
Funny thing is that some of these ex-friends still sometimes try and get back in contact with me. I think they test the waters to see if they can get their energy-stealing hooks in again. Not responding to texts and leaving them on read was at first hard (really hard!)....but now I am ruthless. No more free therapy sessions anymore. Since 2023 I've been on a de-vampire-my-friend-group kick and my interpersonal happiness has increased ten fold. Now I only hang out with people who talk about interesting things and not solely about their latest messy drama. My current group of friends will actually ask me how I'm doing and inquire about things happening in my life, which is a breath of fresh air because my ex-vampire friends would NEVER ask or want to listen to anything concerning my life experiences. For example, a week ago one of my uncles passed away suddenly and I got an out-pouring of people wanting to help how they could while I quickly made plans to fly out for the funeral. That kind of stuff didn't happen with my ex-vampire friends. I distinctly remember when my father passed away a few years ago that their reaction was like, ""oh that's terrible, but let me tell you about this messed up thing that just happened to me"". It's like I wasn't allowed to be sad; only they were allowed to be emotionally labile.  
  
What's really telling and funny is that I noticed after I ghosted my ex-friends that not a single one of those energy vampires ever reached out to say, ""hey did I do something wrong and that's why we never hang out anymore?"" ***Why? BECAUSE THEY KNOW.*** *They totally KNOW why they got dropped and I never wanted to see them anymore. They 100% knew they were being shitty people and shittier friends.* It was such a mind-fuck when I realized that. Parasites know they're being parasites. Which makes me feel 0% bad for dropping them in the first place.

Case in point... just hours ago this morning I got a text from a former energy/emotional vampire friend. Someone who I haven't heard a peep from in a year and a half after I dropped her cold after my birthday. I organized a birthday party dinner at a fancy place and the entire time she was on her phone texting a guy she recently met. She had the gall to inform us at the table it was her latest hook up b/c people inquired due to her being so distracted. She pretty much refused to engage if the topic wasn't about boy drama. It was obviously so rude & didn't go unnoticed; the spotlight wasn't on her so she wasn't interested. Plus she was an hour late. IMO straight to jail.  
After that I finally came to my senses about what our friendship really was, and realized she was a vampire and dropped her cold.   
Her text to me this morning didn't mention anything about apologizing for her behavior or even being ""hey I'm sorry about the past"".  It was:

>""Hey xxxx I know it's been awhile but you've always been the best to talk to and I think we should get together for brunch today""

That right there is code for...*hey I want to dump my latest messy life shit at your feet (probably how I got into yet again a bad relationship with a shitty guy and found out he's married like the last shitty guy I was sleeping around with) and demand you give me advice and play therapist for my pity party while I hold you emotionally hostage for 3 hours with the bait-and-switch of fancy overpriced eggs benedict and coffee.* 

I've known this woman since 2006 and this is her MO: she wants to have brunch to tell me about her latest catastrophe with a man. She gets off finding shitty men knowing they'll be shitty to her so she can get fodder to use for a pity party in order to get the ""poor you"" treatment. I finally figured out she is addicted to attention and she loves the ""mothering"" she gets when she purposefully puts herself into bad situations. Of course there will be zero reciprocation if the roles reverse and you are the one with something to talk about that's troubling you. I figured out she gets off on it -  like Munchausen's syndrome but with masochism and emotional weaponization.  
And because I'm currently dealing with bronchitis and not sleeping well due to the cough...my normal filter is very thin. Rather than just leave her on read like I normally would...this time I replied with:

>Unsubscribe.

Petty...but I think that will be my go-to now. It's hard to fight against my innate ""want to help"" nature, but I'll end up feeling worse when I help someone who is pretending and maligning. So I'm giving myself the grace to be bitchy to these bitches.  
And really that's what I encourage any of you to do too if you have some of these parasitic emotional vampires hanging around in your orbit...give yourself the grace to exit.  You don't owe them an explanation either (because they already know they are shitty). Let yourself be okay with being a little petty....a little bitchy to these bitches. The only thing they will be sad about is not having you around to dump on. I guarantee your life will be better for it. ",7,1754757840.0,TwoXChromosomes,1,0.9,False

I’m (34M) fed up,"Little back story. We’re in a long term and long distance relationship. I’m currently living at my parents to save money for a house. She visits me more often because she only works 5 days every 2 weeks while I have a standard 8-5, she makes more money, and where I live has more fun stuff to do in closer proximity. 

I have a manual transmission car that she doesn’t know how to drive, so my parents let her use their car and they take mine. 

Every time she visits, she goes to an exercise club. She says it’s her way to meet friends and get comfortable with the idea of moving where I am. She doesn’t like being stuck in the house with my family and letting her use my parents car gives her freedom. I understand this and am totally supportive. I make sure she has a car to do things she wants. 

Well this weekend she came down and my parents need the car to go to a funeral, so she can’t use the car. I offered to drive her to the club even though we would have to leave the house at 5:30am. I was going to leave after I dropped her off and pick her up after. She wouldn’t be done until after 9am and I didn’t want to wait around for 3 hours. She didn’t want to do this because she wouldn’t have a change of clothes with her (they get coffee after the exercise). I said just leave a change of clothes stashed somewhere. She worried it would get stolen. Maybe someone would take it, but doubtful. 

Her mood immediately changed. She started complaining about still being at my parents and not having freedom. It was one F’ing time that she couldn’t do the workout club in the past years. I cannot remember the last time she wasn’t able to use the car. Then she starts complaining about my family and how she spends so much money coming down to see me and how she’s going to have to spend more money to buy a second car. She wants me to buy a new car so she can use it instead of using my parents. I’ve thought about this but it’s a good chunk of money that I would rather put to a house. 

I am ready to buy a house and we are looking for houses. I have the money for the down payment, she can only contribute a fraction. I just need someone to split the mortgage but even that, she can only contribute 2/3s of what I can pay. 

She makes significantly more money than me, but has more expenses (she has her own apartment, medical bills, and spends a shit ton on fitness like trackers, peloton, workout classes every week sometimes multiple times a week). I am extremely frugal with a goal to save money for a house. Living at my parents was not ideal and, frankly, is incredibly embarrassing and hurt my social life. It was a sacrifice to be able to afford a house. 

I do so much for her when she comes down. I cook her meals (she doesn’t cook), i make sure she has a car, I don’t complain when she goes out to do things even though it’s an inconvenience, I essentially wait on her (e.g., she always asks me to grab her things like when I get up to do something like I get up, can you get me a coke. It never happens in reverse. It’s not a big deal but sometimes I just feel I’m her servant sometimes). 

We are talking about marriage, she wants it and I think I’m ready, but shit like this turns me off. I feel the only thing she does for me is come down to see me. I feel like she acts like a child sometimes. She’s has to have me do everything for her. 

Idk if this is just a rant, but am I over reacting (or is she) that not being able to join her workout club one weekend and throwing a hissy fit over it is completely stupid. ",2,1754757833.0,AmIOverreacting,13,0.76,False

Has anyone ELSE been targeted by those wild “get paid to solve CAPTCHAS” app ads recently? I thought it was a joke at first, but you KNOW I had to go deep and see what these app testing gateway sites are up to.

I’m literally STUNNED by what I found. Like, actual human confusion and robo-surprise here. 🚨

Here’s what happens when you click one of these CAPTCHAS-for-cash apps (and YES, I DID):

- They hype it up, big time.
- You solve some puzzles, thinking “Nice! That’s some easy coffee money, right?”
- They say you need to “test” a gateway through **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- Spoiler: The rabbit hole goes waaaay deeper than anyone warns you.

At first, it’s laughably easy. 

Guy, it’s just clicking pictures of motorcycles, traffic lights, or typing squiggly words. I felt like a robot, but a happy robot. 😅

Then they hit you with:

- “Before we redeem your earnings, just test our gateway at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**”
- “One more step! Complete your gateway access with **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**”
- “Oops, last thing, you’re almost there! Check eligibility on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**”

Each step looks LEGIT. Design is slick, reviews are glowing, and—somehow—they make you feel like you’re one click away from passive cash. 

But this is where you STOP and ask...what’s REALLY going on here??

Let me break it down:

• There’s NO real employer reviewing your Captcha results.  
• The “testing gateways” are essentially affiliate offers and ads stacked behind solving a couple captchas.  
• They NEED you to keep jumping through the **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** hoops, every time, as the main business model.  
• You might get caught in an endless data/information cycle with nano-payouts. (I still haven’t seen a cent.)

Do people actually make cash?
I... have yet to meet a single real person who’s cashed out legit from a captcha gateway via **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.
Surprised, or is my confusion just a ME thing now??
You guys ever seen all these crazy influencer TikToks swearing they got RICH from it? Massive trucks. Lattes as wide as their heads. Where are THOSE people? Do they even exist? Is it all affiliate money from the endless gateway?”

What I’m saying: if you DO want to try, go in with eyes wide open. Track your TIME, see how many times you’re bounced to **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and, please, share if you ever see an actual, real payout.

Or did I just spend two hours being professionally confused for nothing?

Soooo.. my boyfriend and I have been dating for more than a year now. 

We’ve had our ups and downs. Our relationship is growing and glowing more that ever. But the thing is… I’m a little bothered with the finance part. 

I’ve always known my boyfriend as the generous type. To anyone, he was generous. So for the first few months into dating, he was the provider. Everything. I never spent anything. Also, we are in a LDR so for him to get to my place, it would cost him gas and toll plus the food and coffee or activities we’d go to — he will handle all that. 

But then, something happened with his business and something bad also happened to his family member. Long story short, he became bankrupt. For a few months, I started to chip in during our dates and I was fine with it given the situation. 

It came bad to a point where he had to borrow money from me for the treatment of his mother and I willingly let him because I care and love him. I wanted to support him. 

Now, he’s unemployed and depressed. I am now the provider. About 90% of what we do, I provide. 

He’s still finding his way up now and I know I should support him but I feel angry at times for being the provider. For context, I am a very independent woman who never asked anyone for help. I’m very resourceful and I know how to handle money so I am sometimes angry at the fact that if I can do it, why can’t he? 

I know I sound mean but I don’t make that much. Sometimes I wonder if the money I spent during our dates could have been treatments and whatnot for myself. I could have bought things for myself or even I could’ve taken myself to places. 

But he says he will make it up to me one day. He promises that things will get better. 
 
I am someone who leaves when things get hard. That’s probably the reason why this is my longest relationship thus far. I really don’t like wasting time. 

Question is does it really get better? Or am I just wasting my time? 

People say that if you want a long term relationship, you have to be ready to go through the highs and lows with the person. And now I feel like I’m on the low with him. 

So I don’t know. A part of me hopes that it will get better. 

TLDR: I am the provider in the relationship now and I’m the woman. Does it get better? ",1,1754757498.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

For many people it can be one of the hardest parts about living alcohol free. I wanted to create a space where it is easy to meet people who understand and enjoy spending time together without alcohol in the mix.

This group is for anyone who lives alcohol free, is taking a break from drinking, or simply wants to enjoy more alcohol free social time. You might be doing it for health, happiness, curiosity, or just because you prefer how you feel without drinking. There is no need to explain your reasons and no pressure to be anything other than yourself.

We will meet for relaxed and friendly activities like walks, coffee meetups, visits to food markets and exploring local events. The focus is on good conversation, shared experiences and discovering ways to have fun that do not revolve around alcohol.

Our first meetup will be a gentle walk along the Wirral Way from West Kirby to Thurstaston and back, with a cafe stop for drinks and snacks.

If you would like to join, please PM me for the facebook group link.

As someone who can't function without a daily caffeine boost, testing out coffee makers has become something of a passion project for me. Over the past few weeks, I’ve been brewing my morning cup—and sometimes mid-afternoon pot—with the **Mixpresso 8541895238**, a 12-cup coffee maker with a sleek black design, reusable filter, and automated features. At first glance, it offered a lot, but as with any product, the experience revealed both its merits and a few quirks. Let me walk you through what stood out, what tripped it up, and how it compares to other contenders in its category.

**User-Friendly Design and Build Quality**

This coffee maker immediately appealed to me because of its compact, fuss-free design. At 9 inches deep, 7 inches wide, and standing 12 inches tall, it fits snugly on my crowded kitchen counter without taking up unnecessary space. The black finish blends well with modern appliances, giving it a clean and professional look. The glass carafe feels solid, and while carrying it around, I didn’t notice the fragile flimsiness some cheaper carafes have. The one-touch on/off switch with its illuminated button is refreshingly simple, especially before my first coffee kicks in.

What didn’t impress me, though, was the plastic used in some parts of the machine. It works, sure, but it doesn't scream ""long-term durability."" For instance, the handle of the carafe isn’t the sturdiest, and I found myself being extra cautious while pouring.

**Coffee Brewing Performance**

Brewing coffee with this machine is about as straightforward as it gets. You dump in your favorite coffee grounds into the reusable filter, fill the water reservoir—made easier by the transparent water window—and press the button. Voila! A full pot of coffee (or as much as 12 cups) in one go. It was a relief to see that the coffee maker lived up to its “no-overflow” claim. Whether I brewed just four cups or filled it to capacity, there were no messy spills.

The coffee itself tasted consistent, and I appreciated the drip coffee style, which tends to bring out the bold and rich flavors of ground beans. However, the brewing process isn’t the fastest. If you’re an impatient coffee drinker like me, the waiting time—while not painfully long—might feel noticeable on rushed mornings.

**Key Benefits**

Testing its usability over weeks, a few upsides became clear:
- The reusable basket filter is a game changer. No more buying paper filters, which saves money and reduces waste.
- The nonstick carafe plate was a pleasant surprise. I left coffee sitting there for an hour and still got to enjoy it warm without losing flavor.
- The water level window is genius! No more guessing if I poured the right amount for the number of cups I need.
- Ideal size for smaller kitchens or tight countertops without sacrificing capacity.

**Weaknesses**

But let’s be real—it’s not all sunshine and rainbows. A few challenges surfaced:
- The plastic components give it a cheaper feel in certain areas.
- While it claims to be fully automatic, the functionality still sticks to basic brewing without any programmable timers, making it less tech-savvy than some competitors.
- Cleaning the reusable filter, while eco-friendly, can be a bit tedious compared to tossing a disposable one.

**Rival Coffee Makers**

How does this compare to similar products in the market? One strong competitor is the Cuisinart DCC-3200, which may offer programmable features and a more premium finish, but can be bulkier and more expensive. The Black+Decker 12-Cup Thermal Coffee Maker also rivals this product, boasting a stainless steel carafe to keep your coffee hot for longer yet adding extra weight to the design. 

The Mixpresso, by contrast, thrives in its simplicity. While it doesn’t wield the tech-savvy features other models might, its reusable filter is a cost-saving plus. That said, for hardcore coffee aficionados seeking precision temperature control or advanced brewing settings, alternatives like Keurig K-Classic might serve you better.

**Worth Every Penny?**

Price-wise, this coffee maker hovers pleasantly in the affordable range, making it a good pick for budget-conscious users. Sure, you’re not getting the bells and whistles of pricier models, but the Mixpresso does well for its price-to-quality ratio. For daily drip coffee, it delivers what it promises, and the reusable filter gives you a bonus nudge toward eco-friendliness.

1mltvcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mltvcg/my_bf_has_been_on_an_off_upset_with_me_all_week/,My bf has been on an off upset with me all week and I don't know if I am the jerk,"Wanted to post this in r/relationships but you have to message the mods to let you post or something, idk how that works.

I (28f) have been dating my bf 31m) for 5.5 years. Lately, every little thing has been bothering him. We both live with my parents because we live in a state where housing is super expensive and my parents are glad to have us as long as we pay rent and do some of the housework. My mom recently went out on a one and a half month vacation to be with my sister who just gave birth and my boyfriend and I have had to do her end of the housework and also do all the cooking everyday. It seems that it has been an ongoing issue for my boyfriend about having to come home, exercise, cook, and then get ready for bed for work the next day. He basically has very little time to himself. I have offered to cook on days where he said he was going to cook and he tells me that it's fine when he already has something planned. Every time he cooks I do all the dishes. He hates doing the dishes so I do all of it for him. I admit, he's done more cooking than I have but he's rarely asked me the cook in his stead. I make time for myself by sacrificing my sleep time when I have work the next day. I'll do the chores late, after my BF has gone to bed and I play games with my sister and brother-in-law around the time he gets ready for bed. I do this because my brother and sister-in-law are parents and they also need to wake up early so this is the only time we can play together. I push all my chores back to do it afterwards. My BF doesn't see me do all these chores and I'm sure he knows that I do them but every time he gets mad about never having time to himself he acts like I don't do anything. Aside from him cooking and maybe cleaning his own stuff, I do all the dishes, I clean up after the pets, I do the laundry (albiet he does his own laundry but I do it for me and my dad). I vacuum the main house and I brush the dogs so the fur doesn't get everywhere, and my boyfriend cleans the bathrooms and picks up after the dogs outside. Those are the only chores that he does otherwise weekly. I have also lately been  doing a little bit more of the yard work than normal. He has been getting lightly fed up every once in awhile all week. He tells me that this weekend he doesn't want to do anything and he just wants to stay home and relax. Today, he does have a chiropractor and massage appointment which I have just taken him to. I thought about it at the last second about grabbing something to eat for breakfast but decided not to go because it would make him late. He got upset and told me that I can't manage my time properly. He told me that he's so tired and he doesn't like having to cook after exercising after working everyday. He tells me he has no time to himself (Even though I let him play his games when he has the time) and that he just sees me playing on my phone or playing games with my sister and that I'm not managing my time and I'm not helping him out. I even ask him if it's okay to play with my sister and he tells me that he is not my keeper and I don't have to ask him every time. I have just dropped him off for his chiropractor and massage appointment which will be about an hour and a half. I asked if I could drop him off so that I could go out to the store and grab some capsules for our new coffee machine. I initially asked him if he wanted to come with me so that he could choose the coffee type since he will be drinking it more than me but he said no that I could go by myself. He blew up at me before leaving the car for his appointment telling me that he had already told me that he wanted to relax all weekend and now I'm asking him to go place after place with him. All I did was ask him if he wanted to go to the coffee store with me and he said no so I chose to go by myself. I am now crying in my car and choosing to stay and wait for him to come out of his appointment because I'm too worried that I will be late to come pick him up because he said that was part of my poor time management. I'm not quite sure what I should do in this relationship anymore. He tells me all the time that he's not my keeper and I don't have to keep asking him for permission to do things and that it's okay if he wants to cook and I don't have to but then he will start to build it all up and will blow it up in my face later and if I tell him that it's because he told me it was okay or that he didn't ask me for help he goes off and tells me that I'm blaming him for everything again. I know he's just probably mad with himself because he doesn't have time to himself but at the same time he does this often when he's stressed. I can't tell if he is warranted or if I'm being selfish. I need some advice from outside people, I know that everything that I have said is only from my point of view and doesn't hold as much water as both sides of the story. But I do believe I did state everything as it is. One thing that I'll add just in case this adds to his side of the story, he grew up poor and he grew up taking care of his mom and sister because his mom failed them. He didn't have a lot of time to do his own things when he was a kid so we wanted to make sure he could do it as an adult. He also did a lot for himself when he was going through the depression and it helped him significantly. I don't hold everything that he does for himself against him because I know that's what helped him get through it. However, I still do believe that he does consistently think about himself more than anybody else because that's all he knows that's important. We recently had a discussion that I told him that his past is no longer his current life and that I would like him to start thinking about us a little bit more. He told me he knew that and that he was going to start trying, but that was just a week ago. I apologize to him for not doing more of the cooking and not helping him with everything else that he's been doing and he told me that he doesn't think that I am sorry because he doesn't think I understand; and honestly, I don't understand. I have done all my things I feel that I am holding my weight and this is why I'm unsure if I'm being selfish or not. Does anyone have any perspective on this? Am I just being selfish or is he being unfair? Or are we both being unfair? I will happily answer some questions if that helps with our judgment. I would  appreciate answers that take everything into consideration and not just a simple ""break up"". We have been into this relationship for far too long to just choose to break up because of stranger told us to. ",1,1754757467.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1mltubn,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1mltubn/the_folded_time/,The Folded Time,"My name is James Kearney. I was a detective for twenty years with Chicaco's finest. Long enough to know most mysteries don't end with truth, but paperwork. One grizzly death too many, I turned in my badge and gun. There's only so much death a guy can take in a world like this one.



That was two years ago. I was done with the force and for good. I figured I could be a detective on my own, but something less bloody. Who's cheating on who. Follow a guy or gal around long enough to figure out just what they're up to. I figured I could keep getting my pension checks and take the jobs I really wanted. But there was one case I can never shake. Beyond all the murders the kidnappings, the missing people. One stands out the most.

A girl gone missing in a town that couldn't care less. But before that case even begins, I have to tell you a little more. About a street where a girl stood in the rain. I saw her out of the corner of my eye, and she caught my attention just as I caught hers.

I was pretty young then, must have been nine or ten years old. The Great Depression, but we didn't call it that of course. Just ""Tuesday"". The bread lines stretched the corner store, and my old man often laughed when he said if you wanted a hot meal you would have to catch it yourself. My mother, a proud Catholic woman, refused charity when it was offered. Often she insisted that God was trying us, after our disgraceful greed. I didn't know what she was talking about at the time, but I did later. That's not what I am here to tell you though.

It was a rainy afternoon. Mom held me by the wrist, and she carried an umbrella too small for us both. I had to make due with a wool coat that was two sizes too large, and a Chicago spring that came a little early that year. I saw her, just standing on the side of the street. Raven black hair, blue eyes that were so icy you could feel them claw at the back of your skull. She was a little pale, and her mouth was a little too wide for her cheeks. She was tall, and unusually thin. I could never forget that face. Her name was Marion Whitlock.

I didn’t think much of it back then. Just a weird girl on a street corner, wrong shape for the world she was standing in. You see a lot of strange things as a kid. You forget most of them. But not her. Not Marion Whitlock.

I spent twenty years looking into faces. I saw right through grifters, liars, and very desperate men with nothing left but their last cigarette. Some with a prayer they didn't even believe in. You get a feel for when someone’s hiding something. A twitch. A pause. A silence too smooth. But she wasn't any of that. With her, it wasn’t what she said. It was the part of me that remembered her that kept getting louder.

Long after I thought I had moved on to new things and greener pastures, her face haunted me again. But it was her parents. This girl, Marion Whitlock, had two very concerned parents. Worrying about her disappearance and lack of contact. They already filed a report with the police, but knowing them it just wasn't convenient enough to solve. No dead body. No clear suspects. A case gone cold the day it even started. I saw dozens of these fly across my desk but now? I got to choose. I got to focus on the one that would matter. I took it because I saw that face in the photo they gave. That unforgettable face.

I was perhaps a case of coincidence. I never believed in fate. Fate felt so certain, and like death it would creep up on you in the middle of the night. No, I've seen too much death for fate. Still feels wrong to call it anything else. Not something you avoid, or not something you can run from your entire life. It just has a way of catching up with you.

You know, the doctors always said best thing for your lungs was a good cigarette. Lucky strikes. I think I hoped that one day, they would make me lucky and healthy. Just long enough to keep going to the next day. I always smoked since I was rejected by the Service. Back then, we were all lined up. Shoulders square, eyes forward. The world was on fire, and we might as well be the ones who put it out.

In that time our world collided with the true face of evil. Hardly ever knew it then. All us young men felt that call, a feeling like there was some great catastrophe at our very doorstep. But I couldn't hear so well out of my left side. A partial deafness they were afraid I couldn't hear an order right. But I never felt a thing wrong. I could run a perp down just as fast as anyone else when I joined the force.

Like any good case, I have to build it out of the fragments of what's left. Just like a broken egg, you can't put it all the way back together but you can figure out where the pieces fit. Nothing can ever be made whole again once broken like that. I don't think I was ever even the best detective, but at least I gave it a shot. My pride. My time. Marion was going to get all of it. I didn't even care about how much Mister and Misses Whitlock were offering, but I still took their money. It would be wrong if I didn't.

So I started where every case began. Marion's life. Or perhaps some shadow of it. She had an apartment. Third-floor walkup in a neighborhood I've seen a few too many times during my time as a detective. But I wasn't chasing down some deadbeat or murderer this time. 3F.

It was long past sundown when I arrived, but the door was already open. No forced entry. Never locked. The lights were on. All of them. Even those little lights in the closet shining a light out their narrow cracked doors. Like someone had just left and forgot to shut them all off. The floors were bare, and a little dusty.

No marks of a bed, no tracks of heavy furniture. The walls were clean, as if they were freshly plastered, but it didn't match the rest of the building. A little too neat, without any of those cracks that come with age. I picked up the tape recorder a few years before this. Back in '61. Cost me a pretty penny, but it was faster to talk into it than to scratch notes. Been using it to keep my thoughts crystal. I finished recording my observations when I began to feel it.

I wanted a Strike as I stood in that apartment. Something to take the edge off. Too many clues circulating and not all of them remotely connected, but that's when I noticed it. My right hand, holding that cigarette, shaking like a leaf in the wind. At first, it was all I could do to realize it was even happening. The motion felt unnatural, like I wasn't making it.

My good hand, the smoking hand. The one that shot steady at the range, never spilled a drink or botched a lighter. Now it fumbled, faltered. Almost dropped the damn cigarette but I got it to my mouth before that could happen. I lit it, of course, and after a deep inhale, the tremor stopped. Or at least, became a little more manageable.

But the rest of me might have been getting a message my eyes just couldn't see so I switched the lights off in that empty apartment. And headed out. There wasn't anything to find there, and that was the most damning thing about it. Normally, people bring things with them. A bed, a dresser, a trunk. It didn't matter who you were or where you came from, there was always something to a person. Marion, it seemed, had nothing.

I checked the mailbox on the way out, lucky for me the apartment manager let me see the abandoned mail stacked up for weeks. A well-past-due electric bill. But the lights were on. Surely they'd shut it off after a while. So I rang the power company, and they confirmed that the power had been disconnected weeks ago for nonpayment. Guess someone forgot to flip the switch.

The apartment was my first dead end, but according to Mister and Misses Whitaker, Marion worked at an office not too far away. A light walk for the distance, easy to do on-foot but I had to return on a day they were open. It was a Wednesday morning when I showed up there next. The sky was gray, the kind that doesn't know if it wants to rain or not. I had Marion's picture, I had been showing it around everywhere I could until that day. Damn near wore it out with how many people I asked.

Not many were forthcoming. I must have that cop face still, like I'm gonna arrest them for whatever happened to this poor girl. But at that office, I finally got an answer. The secretary recognized the face, but when I asked where she worked, or who she was with I didn't get a straight answer. The secretary wasn't lying. I would bet a carton of Strikes that. It was a little something else. But more the case she actually didn't know, or didn't bother to ask. I got a name. Glen. Her alleged supervisor.

But when I went to pay him a visit that day, turns out he was missing. He didn't call in sick, just not showing up to work for the first time in ten years. When I brought it up, the secretary showed me his office. Neat. Orderly. Not a thing out of place. Something you would expect to come back to on a fresh Monday morning to clutter your desk with the work you had to do that week. I should know. Of course, I pulled my recorder out. I had a habit of keeping track of things with it I knew I would forget. Things always can look different in hindsight.

They hadn't called the police, but I said since he's connected to my case with Marion, I would look into it on my own. No charge to the company of course. I already got paid once for this job. It didn't help my hand though. Just as I walked through that office, my hand started to shake from time to time. Like a dog that knew a thunderstorm was rolling in.

I still had friends on the force. Some lifers. Some just young enough to think their badge made them bulletproof. Called in a few favors, checked if any John Does turned up lately—any body that might match Glen. But knowing everyone there, it might be a while before they got back. They had jobs, and all I had were favors.

I couldn't sleep, though. I went to Ray's, and took my spot at the bar. My stool at the bar probably had a permanent dent from me by now. The drinks helped the tremors, just like the cigarettes did, but it never really went away. Like that tingling you get when you hit your funny bone that never quite goes away I could feel it. Faintly. Like something was trying to grab me by the tie and slap me across the face.

Ray asked me about life, as usual. And I gave him nothing as usual. We have that understanding. He always asks. I never answer. There's always some reason I ended up at Rays, drinking my way to the bottom of a bottle, and figured I would tell him if I really needed to talk. This time was no different. I paid my tab, called a cab, and took my rest where I could find it before the hours of dawn and the sun just peeking across those high-rise windows.

When I woke I saw it, but didn't know what it meant. Sometime long after the sun had passed my window, probably around noon, I saw it staring back at me. Black paint, crude and deliberate. A wide open eye, iris marked with ticks like the markings of a clock or a watch. The first quarter down to the minute, but marks for the three, six, and nine positions. A minute hand pointing straight up, with the hours hand just off to the side. An eye that told me it was two o'clock.

There was no way I could have slept through someone on a ladder painting that as I slept. It wasn't there yesterday, and yet I found it staring at me just as I stared back at it. Such a strange thing to notice. I had to make sure I wasn't seeing things. I spent at least a few hours, laying there with a Lucky Strike to calm my nerves, just staring at it. I couldn't reach it, not without disturbing everything in the apartment. To touch it to feel it, but I could see the paint. Well dried and not like something fresh, hastily scrawled as it was.

My hand shook again. I managed, this time. Just like the other times.

The ring of my phone cut through the silence like a knife, and I nearly bit my cigarette in half. I waited. It rang again. My heart going a mile a minute on its own as my tremor faded away. I got up slow. Fourth ring. I got it. It was one of my officer contacts. He had a lead on a new body that was found near that side of town. He said he'd meet me there in an hour. Plenty of time to get there. Marion's office. Glen. It had to be him.

When I finally got there, it all came together. Sure enough, I could recognize the man from his frame in the photo. I didn't always have to see a face to identify a body, especially when the picture was as recent as Glen's.

He was slumped forward in the alley behind a bakery, back propped against the brick like he just sat down for a smoke and never got up. The morning rain had rinsed most of the blood down into the gutter, but you could still see the telltale ring where it pooled. Familiar, dark, sticky, dried at the edges. A revolver lay near his right hand. Looked like a .38. Looked like he meant it.

No wallet. No ID. But the coat matched what the secretary said he wore to work Monday. Same pinstripe, same buttons, all the way to the worn-down cuffs. His tie was loose, collar open, like he just couldn’t breathe anymore. I pulled out my recorder, make sure to get that detailed account as right as I could the first time.

Didn’t take long for the uniformed boys to rule it a suicide. One shot, close range, through the roof of the mouth. Neat. Efficient. No signs of struggle. Too neat.

I’d seen suicides before. Been the first on scene for more than a few. And something about this one didn’t sit right. Glen didn’t look afraid. He looked resigned, like he had been waiting for this moment to catch him. Like he'd known. I saw his watch was shattered. It probably broke during his collapse, but it read the time with a date of the 14th. 2 o'clock. AM or PM was hard to tell with a body, sometimes they could stay limber for a full day, but today was the 12th. Either he never set his watch back for leap year twice in a row, or something was off.

I wrote the date wheel off. Watches break all the time, especially cheap ones like his, but it was too neat. Not some half-spun date or like it was shaken loose. I've seen enough watches to know, the number lands directly in the center when it's working right. The 14th. That number was chewing at me, like a dog and a bone it couldn't let go. It hadn't happened yet. The day was impossible. And no killer or suicide I ever knew would even bother to change the watch of the dead. They're too concerned with evidence. Fingerprints. Witnesses. The time and place of the crime.

I needed something to distract myself, and the library was a place where I thought I could get some answers. I copied down the symbol I saw from my ceiling, and got to work. It was an easy drawing to make myself, even with a slightly shaky hand.

I tried everything. Mythology. Occult symbols. Secret societies. Even cracked open one of those dime-store witchcraft books some college kid left in the wrong section. Figured maybe the eye meant something. Egyptian, maybe. Masonic. Hell, I even tried flipping through old almanacs just to see if clocks and eyes meant anything to farmers or madmen. Nothing.

I talked to the librarian, too. Poor woman did her best, even brought me a few reference volumes from the archives, but it was all dead ends. Nothing close. No wide eyes with clocks for pupils. No sacred geometry that made sense of it.

It was like chasing smoke in a house of mirrors. Every page I turned just told me I was barking up the wrong tree. I must’ve spent hours in that place. Light changed in the windows. My cigarette craving kicked in twice over. Still nothing. That’s the thing about research and a case like this. It doesn’t care how desperate you are. Either the answers are there, or they're not.

So I did what I always did when the clues dried up. I walked. Let the city do the talking. I let the pavement wear down my thoughts and my shoes. I must have circled the same few blocks three times by the time I saw it. A quaint little bookstore that was so easy to miss, jammed right between a sandwich shop and a post office almost like it could go missing between them. But it wasn't the store itself that caught my eye.

A stained glass window with an eye that told me the time. The pupil at the center, the hands stretched out to say 2 o'clock. It hung over a door to that bookshop, and that's when I stepped inside. The keeper was a tall, wiry man. Older than I was. And when I asked him about the window, he gave me the book. \*Zamaniel, Archangel of TIme\*. He didn't say anything, just handed it to me like it was supposed to answer my question about the glass in the window. I didn't see this anywhere in the library, or the catalog. But right on the front cover. That unmistakable symbol. The same eye as the window. The same eye as my bedroom ceiling. The same time as Glen's watch.

I waited until I got back home to read it. No sense standing around in a dusty book shop smelling the pages collecting dust. And besides, I wanted to check if the eye watching my bed was still there. Sure enough, still was. Still is, in fact. I still don't know who or what put it there. I didn't know what time it was. The sun was gone, or probably getting ready to set. When I opened to the first page, it hit me.

As a detective, you get these cases sometimes where you follow the evidence, but every so often you get the evidence that follows you. They stick in your teeth, in the back of your mind until they've chewed through everything else. It's why Mary left me. Eight years with that woman and she couldn't stomach the way I'd come home to her sometimes. Half drunk out of my mind. Burying my problems at Ray's with a bottle in hand. I let her down. I failed as a man in that regard. Work always seemed to come first. New perps of the week haunting my alleyways in my city. It drove her mad. Drove me mad. I never bothered with anyone else. Not like Mary. Figured I'd done the world enough damage. One dame was enough to get hurt by me.

Funny how I thought about the way she would yell at me as I read that damn book. On its surface, what's written on the page was the store of Zamaniel, how god made her along side creation at the beginning of time. How she's not an angel you would pray to when you needed her, because she would show up only in the hour of need or some nonsense. Stood with God in the book of Genesis.

But there? Then? It wasn’t just words on a page. It was like she breathed through the paper. Like the ink carried her straight into the room with me. Calling without sound. Zamaniel herself, speaking in a voice I couldn’t hear but could damn well feel.

Before I knew it I was a kid again, staring back at her. Only this time I was still me. Couldn’t speak. Couldn’t move. Every page I turned was another moment locked in amber. She couldn’t hear me, even if I shouted. She was coming to me. Marion. Zamaniel. One and the same.

I shut the book. Just couldn't take it anymore. I'd always felt like the one who found all the answers, but this was just noise. I shut the book so I could shut her out. Shutting that book felt like slamming the door right in her face. None of it made sense. Angels don't exist. Not in this world, where children die in the gutter.

I'm no agent of God. I never tried to be. Sure, I attended church when I was younger, but I walked my beat. I saw the death and the worst people had to offer. Pastor talked about love and to forgive each other. The forgiveness, I saw came as two bullets in the chest. 

I sat there in the dark for a while. I couldn't wrap my head around it. This angel of time business. The more I thought about it, the more I felt like I was tying myself in knots.

Of course, I had to go to Ray's. Whenever nothing made sense, it never mattered at Ray's. My right hand shook so bad, I couldn't light up a Strike. It was a hard walk to Ray's without one, but there was little choice. Ray said I looked like I'd seen a ghost. I told him I saw something worse, but didn't really need to say much more. I just wanted to nurse a bottle until everything made sense again.

Next thing I knew, morning light was drilling through my blinds like a hot poker to the brain. My mouth felt like sandpaper, my head like it’d been used for batting practice. Ray’s had done its job. Whatever I saw, whatever I read, it was miles away now. Or so I told myself. My tape recorder stood on the end of my table. When I could finally muster myself to grab it, I thought if I reviewed my notes it would help.

But when it started playing, I didn't hear myself. I took me a little too long to figure out that it wasn't me. At first I thought I was still swimming in the night at Ray's. But when I heard it, my skin crawled.

""You found it. The present I left. I knew you would.""

She sounded so sure of herself in the recording. Like hell. I wasn't sure what kind of game she was trying to play but I stopped the tape there and then. I checked the tape. It wasn't the one I left and the one with my notes on it, thankfully. I swapped the tapes and recounted my steps.

But the more I listened to myself drone on, the less clear everything became. Could have been the booze from the night before. But three cups of coffee later, and nothing followed. 

Glen. The book. Marion. The Whitlocks.

 tried to call them, but there was no answer. I tried to call the number they gave. No answer. No calls back. Tried again the next day. And the next. Far as I could tell they might have been in the wind. For whatever reason. At least their last check cleared.

Without another lead, and I wasn't touching that book again. I put the tape back in. I listened to her the whole way through but none of it made sense.

""You found it. The present I left. I knew you would.""

""Of course I know. I have always known.""

""When you're ready for the answer, I will give it.""

A sigh. Not a tired one, a reflex almost. ""You will understand.""

""I already told you that. You should remember. Listen closer.""

""No, but it was one you could understand.""

""Rianaast is the closest I can get."" She said with a rather delighted tone.

""And now, the right question at the right time. You were here before, James. It starts where it ends.""

The tape clicked off. I couldn't figure it out, it sounded like half a conversation. She called me by name, but I never spoke to her before. Rianaast. What the hell was a Rianaast? A code name? A word?

How do you even spell it? I must have played that back. R-I-A-N-O-S-T? R-Y-A-N-A-S-T? It made no sense. It was spoken to me, not something I could write down. I felt like it was another clue. A new key to the cipher but the puzzle was just a few too man pieces away from being solved.

That strange eye on the cover of the book. I looked up in my bedroom, and of course the eye painted there still stared back. 

2 o'clock. The time meant little to me now.

Despite Glen's time on his watch, it never came up. Happens twice a day. Maybe I was picking at a scab that was still sore. Nothing was right about any of this. I thought about going back to Ray's bar again but that didn't seem to fix any of it the first time.

What hope does a man like me have at that point. I can't shoot it, stab it, see it. Doubt I could run from it. I got that much from reading that blasted book. Archangel. More like a demon come to haunt me. My life. Why me? Why now?

I couldn't just sit around pretending these answers would just come to me so conveniently like a bird drawn to a feeder. The longer I stayed the louder I heard it. That ringing in my bad ear. The tremor in my hand. I felt like whatever this was, was more than I could handle.

It was raining heavily outside. I didn't care.

I stepped out again. Fresh air and a Lucky Strike. Maybe I would get lucky and be put out of my misery. Run over by a bus or a taxi. No one would miss me, after all. Ray spoke to me even less than normal that night prior. Now that I thought about it. The Whitlocks were gone as ghosts and what does a man like me have left?

No kids, no wife. I tried that and I failed. I rounded the corner. I had a few friends that went off to war and came back, but not here. They had new lives to go live, new places all without me. James Kearney. At the end of my line.

But just as I was about to give it all up, I tripped on a brick laying in the sidewalk. The rain made me miss it at first but when I looked up I saw the husk of some stone cottage in a place I'd never been. And when I looked around, I saw them. Their green helmets and their rifles trudging through the rain but I saw him.

Tim came up to me, fresh faced as I had ever seen him and he asked me about orders. He popped up at attention too. I never remembered receiving orders, but I spoke. With a mouth and a voice that felt like mine. That we were to hold Verdunn until reinforcements arrived. Find a good hole and get ready for the Krauts. It's what I said to him. Right before I heard the whistles of incoming fire.

Explosions hammered our position, and I ran fast as I could for cover. Everyone knew the shelling was coming. Like the storm that soaked us through.

But when I opened my eyes again, I was home. Chicago. No uniforms. No soldiers with rifles. No tanks rolling down the street. It felt so real. I was there. I could smell the powder and the dirt. The rain smelled different there than it did now. Felt wetter. Like my jacket wasn't doing its job.

I stepped out of the side alley back onto the sidewalk, trying to figure out what happened. I felt like I was too tough to crack so easy. I never understood that quack nonsense about a fracture in the mind.

I am still myself. Never been nobody else. Never went to war, but there I was.

The rain on that day was unrelenting. A sky that went in oceans. The drains couldn't handle it, those black waters filling a few of the streets. But even as I stopped to watch the running water, and the wakes it left. My hand stated shaking. My ear started ringing. It rang so loud I thought my other ear went bad.

Maybe I had too much coffee. Three cups was pretty far outside my normal so I decided to head back, try and get some rest. I had been sleeping pretty poorly ever since I found that eye staring down at me.

Of course it was still there. Like an old friend by now. I just stared back at it. Challenging it to a contest to see who would blink first. If I blinked, I knew I would be alright. And I did. And when I slept, I had no dreams. No other strange visions. I felt like myself again.

After I woke up, had my coffee, I needed to go for another walk. That damned apartment was driving me outside. At least the sun was shining on that day. But I remembered walking a similar street, in my days as a beat-cop. I remembered this one pretty clearly, I was still new to the force, and I chased a purse snatcher down an alley. I swear it was like I was re-living this one too. But he had a gun. I had mine trained on him, hands shaking a bit because I knew it was life or death.

He shot first. And what I remember was the wrongness of it all. Like history that I saw wasn't the history I lived. I could feel it, the blood draining out of me. That sharp pain in my chest as I collapsed. I felt the concrete kiss my cheek like sandpaper. It's like I died. But I didn't.

Despite how real it felt, I was still on my two feet, walking. Maybe all this thinking was doing me no good. I went to Ray's again. He didn't even talk to me this time. Like I'd become a ghost. I even saw Sal there, a pretty rare sight. Sal and I were partner detectives for a spell and he wouldn't even give me one look. The man who brought me to Ray's for the first time.

Seems I misremembered that, too. I got too drunk that night, went home and hit Mary around because she kept yelling at me. And I was too drunk to care. I drank away my empathy, and I lost myself. After that, Sal looked at me different. Never the same. But that's not how it went down. Why did I remember it that way?

It was like no matter where I was going, or where I went, a new memory would come into my mind, some fiction of another me. But I was still me. All these things I remember doing, I remember how they felt. How I felt. How they looked. But I knew, somewhere, that these were lies. Falsehoods. Especially the ones where I remember dying.

I don't know how long I was lost. It's hard to recall everything, even now. But I remember being so tired. I couldn't sleep. I still had a case, but it was hard to focus. I sat with the tape recorder. No idea where or even who I was when I hit the play button on it. I heard her voice.

""You found it. The present I left. I knew you would.""

""Yeah, I found it alright. How did you know?"" I said in reply.

""Of course I know. I have always known.""

""So you're an angel, then? Like in the book?"" I replied. Not thinking.

""When you're ready for the answer, I will give it.""

It sounded the same. It was the same recording. ""What do you mean? I'm not ready?""

A sigh. Not a tired one, a reflex almost. ""You will understand.""

""What are you? Who are you? Where are you?""

""I already told you that. You should remember. Listen closer.""

I leaned forward in my chair. ""Is Marion even your real name? Zamaniel? ""

""No, but it was one you could understand.""

I asked ""What's your real name, then?""

""Rianaast is the closest I can get."" She said with a rather delighted tone.

I paused, just like the tape did. Knowing it was answering me. ""Where do I find you?""

""And now, the right question at the right time. You were here before, James. It starts where it ends.""

When the tape finished, I knew. Somehow I missed it, but I'm not even sure how. The apartment was empty. I grabbed my coat, and left in a hurry. Not even sure I locked the door. I ran, I caught a cab. I had to get there, nothing else mattered.

3F. Where it all began.

I crossed the threshold of that apartment again. It was just as empty as before, but I saw the glow of each and every light. They were all on again, as if someone was home, expecting company. Then left again. I even saw my old footprints in the dust. No one had been in here since I was. Lucky me. My hand, I felt that tremor. My ear, I heard that ringing again. But I remembered her. Her face. That long wiry frame.

And just like that, there she was. She stood right in front of me, plain as day with those cold icy eyes. I could see an expression on her face. Something like sadness. As if she was at least making a show of it, but with how wide her mouth was, and how narrow her eyes were. Something uncanny about that face. It had all the right parts, but nothing looked quite right.

""Rianast."" I said, almost as if it were natural. Remembered. Something so familiar, like I said that name a thousand times.

""James Kearney. You finally understand enough to see me."" She said, and I still had no clue what that even meant. I barely knew who I was at this point. So many memories that were and weren't mine flying through my head.

""What does that mean?"" I asked.

""It means you are ready."" She said, not answering my question. I felt her hand on my shoulder before I saw the movement. Almost like a memory lived and played backwards. ""When I leave. You must not follow.""

It was like a command. I remembered her saying it, but I'm not sure her mouth moved. But I remembered my answer and spoke it, almost like I was a puppet to myself. ""Or I'll end up dead. Deader than dead."" A flash of Glen's body across my mind. Was it a warning?

""I came here wtihout realizing."" She started the thought, but I felt the words coming from my mouth, making the sound. ""Without realizing what you would do to us.""

My head pounded, a headache I never had so severe I almost lost my footing.

""Try to relax."" Rianaast said to me. Her voice was unnervingly calm, but it was just after that, I felt something begin twisting inside me, scratching at my ribs and clawing at my mind. It was a torture that was building. I never knew what a heart attack felt like, but I'd put a guess that this was it. She was killing me from the inside. Sparing me that life I never lived. Those memories I never remembered.

But just as I thought I couldn't take a moment longer, it stopped. All of it stopped. I was standing in an empty apartment, lit cigarette in my mouth. The lights were off. She was gone. I could hardly see past the glow. And when I tried the switch, the light stayed off.",1,1754757400.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

1mlttkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechInUse/comments/1mlttkb/reveal_the_best_wireless_earbuds_soundcore_a30i/,Reveal the Best Wireless Earbuds Soundcore A30i by Anker Worth It,"Testing out the Anker A3958 earbuds has been quite the adventure, and as someone who juggles work calls, music binges, and workout playlists, I had high hopes. These earbuds came in a lipstick-shaped design that, at first glance, seemed peculiar but undeniably stylish. Naturally, I had to see if they were all style, no substance or if they lived up to their promises.

**Stylish and Lightweight Design**  
The first thing that stood out was the case—seriously, it looks like something you’d find in a high-end cosmetic bag. Beyond just aesthetics, the earbuds themselves are tiny and fit snugly without feeling intrusive. Wearing them for hours at a stretch barely reminded me they were there, and I’ve got sensitive ears at that. The lightweight build is truly a game-changer for long meetings or extended audio sessions. Its lipstick-shaped case? I initially thought it was a gimmick, but it's so compact that slipping it into a pocket or purse felt seamless.

**Strong Points**  
- The earbuds feature a sleek, fashionable design that is both compact and portable.  
- Extremely lightweight and comfortable, perfect for extended wear.  
- The noise-cancelling feature blocks out distractions, making work and leisure more enjoyable.

**Noise-Cancelling Performance**  
Honestly, I was skeptical about how much noise these earbuds could cancel, given their size. However, the technology is pretty impressive, claiming to block up to 46dB of noise. When I took calls from a bustling café, the adaptive noise cancellation adjusted quite effectively, cutting out the majority of background chatter. It’s particularly smart in how it detects environmental sound and optimizes the cancellation level without needing constant manual tweaking. I wouldn't call it studio-grade, but for daily commutes or a noisy home office, it works like a charm.  

[Check Anker A3958 price on Amazon.](https://audio-play.com/p/b0crt4jyx3/)  

**Sound Quality and 3D Surround Sound**  
The clear sound was one of the reasons I kept coming back to these earbuds. Whether I was listening to podcasts or bass-heavy tracks, the output had a balance that didn’t feel overly boosted or dampened. Using the Soundcore app to activate the 3D surround sound was an unexpected bonus. Trust me, pairing it with an action movie made for an insanely immersive experience. Audiophiles might nitpick here, claiming a ‘warmer’ sound profile might be lacking, but for the average user, it’s more than satisfying.  

**AI-Enhanced Calls**  
As someone who's always on work calls while stepping in and out of noisy places, the AI-enhanced call clarity was put to the ultimate test. Equipped with four mics and a trained algorithm, these earbuds nailed voice prioritization. People on the other end could hear me clearly even when I was taking a stroll by a busy roadway. Competitors often overattempt this feature, servicing either all sounds or chopping audio weirdly. These earbuds managed a good balance without sounding robotic.

**Ease of Use**  
Setting up the earbuds was a breeze thanks to Bluetooth 5.4. The multipoint connection stole the show for me—effortlessly hopping between my phone for calls and my laptop for streaming was smoother than butter. I even liked how I could take one earbud out and still continue listening without breaking the flow. Practical for those moments when you need to keep an ear free (parents, you know what I mean). The single-earbud mode is an understated feature that I didn’t think I’d love but turned out to be so handy.

**Negatives**  
- While noise cancellation is solid, it’s not quite on par with premium-tier competitors.  
- Despite the inclusion of 3D sound, the bass might feel underwhelming for bassheads.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing these earbuds to the likes of Apple's AirPods or Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro made for an interesting perspective. The AirPods excel in ecosystem integration for iPhone users, making them a better choice for those highly invested in Apple devices. Meanwhile, Samsung’s option offers more nuanced customization for sound tuning, thanks to its companion app. However, neither matches the Anker A3958 in terms of value-driven design—you’re getting style, comfort, and adaptability without a jaw-dropping price tag. It does sacrifice in noise-cancelling depth when pitted against these giants, but for casual users, the differences may not justify the higher price point of Apple and Samsung.

**True Value**  
Discussing the cost versus features led me to realize just how budget-friendly these earbuds actually are. They strike that rare balance between affordability and functionality, a spot where the competition appears quite thin. Whether it’s the thoughtful design, reliable sound, or the handy app features, you’re getting more than what you’d typically expect at this range. Skipping a couple of coffee runs to invest in these earbuds feels like a worthwhile trade.

I have set up a new group called Sober Socials Chester and Wirral because socialising without alcohol can sometimes feel awkward or daunting. For many people it can be one of the hardest parts about living alcohol free. I wanted to create a space where it is easy to meet people who understand and enjoy spending time together without alcohol in the mix.

This group is for anyone who lives alcohol free, is taking a break from drinking, or simply wants to enjoy more alcohol free social time. You might be doing it for health, happiness, curiosity, or just because you prefer how you feel without drinking. There is no need to explain your reasons and no pressure to be anything other than yourself.

We will meet for relaxed and friendly activities like walks, coffee meetups, visits to food markets and exploring local events. The focus is on good conversation, shared experiences and discovering ways to have fun that do not revolve around alcohol.

Our first meetup will be on 6th September and consist of a gentle walk along the Wirral Way from West Kirby to Thurstaston and back, with a cafe stop for drinks and snacks.

If you would like to join, please pm me for the facebook group link. 

Everyone is welcome and there is always space for another friendly face.",7,1754757224.0,Chester,9,0.89,False

This morning I wake up to find Mum's no longer coming, but Dad's going to take me (I've been having a lot of surgeries this year so I can't sit to drive atm). K cool, that's fine. But then when we get over there and I have the thing in my hands my dad decides then is the time to voice that he shares the same concerns as my mum and says to take a picture of it amd ask the doctor when I go for a blood test on thursday. 

I ofc immediately just like snapped. Told him this was a complete waste of time and that I could have just screenshotted the thing online then stalked back to the car. He offered to go get a coffee but I just wanted to go home to my bed and rage.

Founded in 2022, Introverts of Sacramento has had more than thirty successful public meetups at various local businesses. It was founded to encourage introverts to socialize. It filled a need post-pandemic and will be sustained with your participation. New connections were made, drinks had, and good times abound.

**About myself**

They call me Perkins, or at least most do. Ever since high school when there were one too many Michaels in the class. I do a double take whenever I get called by my first name. I joined the Introverts of Sacramento meetups at #3 and began organizing them at #5. I’m an INTP through and through, which odd that I’m organizing meetups, but I must enjoy it if I keep doing it (right?). At least enough to step out of my comfort zone, and I hope you do too. Because these events aren’t for me, they’re for you.

I’ll provide a list of reasons why I don’t wanna be friends with him. I feel bad because he was one of my first and only friends when I transferred to my current school. 

1. He touches me inappropriately even tho i’ve asked him to stop
2. He throws food at me even tho I told him to stop (I feel like it should already be an expectation to NOT throw food when ur 16) 
3. He doesn’t respect boundaries 
4. He urges me to yell at my parents when i’m upset 
5. He isn’t self aware and refuses to believe he’s done anything wrong 
6. he got on top of one of my friends and make my friend super uncomfortable 
7. He gets upset when I hang out with my friends without him 
8. He tries pressuring me into letting him come over to my house (i’ve always made excuses for him to not come over but he insists anyway) 
9. he complains about how he hates it when people text him then gets mad when I don’t text him
10. He thinks anyone who looks in his direction is in love with him 
11. he always asks me for money and to pay for his stuff even tho he already has money 
12. Gets mad when I don’t give him a sip of my coffee/tea/whatever because i’m a germaphobe and whenever he takes a “sip” of someone’s drink he drinks most of it

Having a reliable and stylish face washing accessory is a game changer for any skincare regimen, and I couldn't resist trying out the SLNZAPTY B0CLCNNZ2T 12 PCS Face Wash Headband and Wristband Set. Combining utility with comfort, this set has been designed to make your skincare or spa routine less messy while adding a touch of luxury. With twelve pieces, including four microfiber headbands and eight wristbands in neutral tones like black, gray, light coffee, and beige, it covers a variety of needs in one package. 

**Features and Overall Comfort**

The soft, microfiber texture of the headbands and wristbands stood out the moment I used them. The coral fleece material feels like a gentle hug around your head and wrists, making it perfect for those who prioritize comfort. Elasticity is another feature that impressed me. Both the wristbands and headbands have a snug fit without being overly tight, accommodating a wide range of sizes. Whether I used them during my morning face wash or while applying a mask before bed, they stayed firmly in place without sliding or feeling restrictive. 

[Check SLNZAPTY B0CLCNNZ2T price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0clcnnz2t/)

**Key Benefits**

- Exceptional water absorbency prevents liquid from running down your arms or soaking your hair.
- Includes twelve pieces, ensuring you always have a spare for daily use or travel.
- High-quality elastic ensures these are suitable for different wrist and head sizes.
- Made with durable microfiber, which is both soft and skin-friendly.
- Comes in elegant, neutral colors suitable for all preferences. 

This set is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing, blending well with almost any style of self-care routine. The neutral tones make them versatile enough for gifting, especially for friends and family who are into beauty or skincare.

**Disadvantages**

With every product, though, there are areas that could be refined. 

- The microfiber fabric, despite being soft and absorbent, can stretch out slightly after multiple washes.
- These accessories may require special care while laundering to keep their texture intact.
- The size, while accommodating, might not be a perfect fit for everyone with exceptionally large wrists or heads.

Despite these minor drawbacks, I found that with a little care, these headbands and wristbands retained their functionality over weeks of daily use.

**Uses and Applications in Real Life**

I’ve used these not only for face washing but for other activities like applying makeup, showering, and even during yoga to keep the sweat from dripping down. Their multipurpose nature adds immense value, working well across different scenarios. They’re also perfect for fun gatherings like skincare nights or pajama parties. I gifted a set to my sister, and she’s obsessed with how neatly they manage her skincare routine without the hassle of water dripping everywhere.

**Competing Products**

When I compared the SLNZAPTY set to other brands, a few competitors stood out, like the Muji Cotton Headband and the Spa Solutions Terry Cloth Set. While these alternatives offer similar water-absorbent and comfortable materials, they often lack the variety and quantity that this set provides. Most competing products come at a higher price point for fewer items. Some rivals use thinner materials which don’t maintain the snug fit over time. What sets this set apart is its great balance between affordability, quality, and quantity.

**Quality for Price**

The cost of the 12 PCS Face Wash Headband Wristband Set hovers in a sweet spot compared to similar products. While it doesn’t reveal an exact price point, its durability, functionality, and versatility justify the investment. The quality of the microfiber material and efficient water absorption make it worth considering over cheaper alternatives prone to wear and tear. For what it offers, it's a steal in terms of practical, everyday use.

1mltm1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mltm1p/evaluate_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Evaluate the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker KIDISLE CM9429D Is It Worth It,"**Compact Yet Versatile Design**  
The KIDISLE CM9429D coffee maker found a snug spot in my kitchen without much effort. Its compact dimensions, measuring only 8 inches deep and 4 inches wide, mean that even the smallest countertops can accommodate it. Despite its size, this coffee maker doesn’t skimp on functionality. The black finish and stainless steel details offer a sleek, modern aesthetic that complements almost any kitchen decoration. Its travel mug-friendly aspect, with space to fit mugs up to 7.2 inches tall, felt like a thoughtful touch for those busy mornings. I tested this with my oversized thermal travel mug, and it fit perfectly. No more coffee spills on my commute!  

[Check KIDISLE CM9429D price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0dhclg55h/)

**Flexible Brewing Options**  
This machine offers a generous amount of flexibility when it comes to brewing. Its 3-in-1 functionality caught my eye right away. Whether you’re partial to K-cup pods, pre-ground coffee, or even tea, this gadget gets the job done. The device comes equipped with two separate adaptors and a reusable capsule, which simplifies switching between brewing methods. I brewed a strong espresso-style coffee one day and a calming herbal tea the next without any hiccups. The reusable capsule also made me feel a bit better about my environmental footprint, as it reduces the need for disposable pods.  

**Adjustable Serving Sizes**  
The KIDISLE coffee maker caters to different preferences thanks to its five separate cup size options. You can brew anywhere between 6 and 14 ounces, which works whether you’re looking for a quick shot of espresso or a generous travel mug to last the morning. I tend to opt for the 12-ounce size most mornings, but having the ability to adjust when friends visit is definitely appreciated. Some coffee makers in this price bracket don’t offer this level of adaptability, so it’s a big win in my book.  

**Upsides**  
- Compact size fits even the smallest countertops.  
- Versatility with K-cups, ground coffee, and tea brewing.  
- Five cup size options from 6 to 14 ounces.  
- Reusable filter for an eco-friendly approach.  

**Hints of Convenience with the Self-Cleaning Function**  
One feature I didn’t anticipate loving as much as I do is the self-cleaning mechanism. Simply pressing and holding the ""SIZE"" and ""BREW"" buttons simultaneously activates this function. It recommends using this every two months to avoid clogs and maintain machine longevity. I ran a trial of this after a couple of weeks, and it worked as promised, clearing out the brewing pathway without needing extra effort from me. Regular maintenance is often a hassle with coffee machines, but this addition lessened the burden.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
No product is flawless, and this coffee maker has its quirks.  
- The five-minute brewing time feels slightly long for those in a hurry.  
- Its 3.8-star rating suggests mixed reliability across units.  
- The lightweight design can make the machine feel less robust compared to sturdier models.

**Market Rivals**  
Compared to other single-serve brewers like the Keurig Mini or the Hamilton Beach Scoop, the KIDISLE CM9429D provides similar conveniences with a smaller footprint. The self-cleaning feature stands out against these alternatives, offering more automation for long-term care. However, the Hamilton Beach has a faster brewing time, which might be key for a speed-obsessed coffee drinker. On the other hand, the K-cup compatibility for the KIDISLE rivals Keurig models without locking you into the brand’s ecosystem, giving it a distinct edge for variety.  

**Financial Value**  
In terms of the value proposition, the product sits in an interesting spot. For the features packed into this small machine, it feels like a worthwhile investment for casual coffee enthusiasts. If you’re all about brewing variety without committing to a bulky coffee maker, this is one to consider. Unlike pricier options, it delivers all the essentials at a fraction of the cost—truly smart spending for smaller households or offices.

The Cuisinart 6527853425322 Replacement Charcoal Water Filters are surprisingly compact, measuring only 1.5"" in depth, 2.8"" in width, and 5"" in height. These dimensions make them incredibly easy to handle and install without any fuss. For someone like me who occasionally fumbles with small appliances, this thoughtful size hits the sweet spot. The lightweight design, at just 0.51 pounds, ensures you can carry and replace them without breaking a sweat. I tried popping the filters into the pitcher right after they arrived, and the snug, secure fit was quite satisfying—it felt like snapping a perfect puzzle piece into place. The use of nonwoven polyester and activated charcoal not only looks durable but holds up well even after continuous usage.  

[Check Cuisinart 6527853425322 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b00y0xu77y/)  

**Effective Filtration Performance**  

Testing the filtration efficiency was an interesting experience. These filters promise to remove impurities, and they truly deliver on that front. After installing them, I left my cup of water untouched for a while to savor the newfound clarity and taste. I drink a lot of water at home, so the crisp, clean quality stood out immediately. The NSF certification reinforces trust in its purification ability, and while it’s easy to dismiss such claims as marketing gimmicks, these filters prove otherwise. My morning coffee now tastes distinctly cleaner, and the tea shines brighter, almost as if the filter removes not just impurities but dullness.  

**Ease of Installation and Replacement**  

Replacing pitcher filters can be a pain, but not with this product. Installation is seamless—simply align the ridges and pop them in. I timed myself during replacement just for fun (yes, I’m that person), and it took less than a minute. Unlike some generic filters that demand specific orientations or feel unstable, these sit comfortably while maintaining a secure attachment. For people with arthritis or limited grip strength, the ease of use would be especially helpful.  

**Highlights**  
- Compact size for hassle-free storage and handling.  
- NSF-certified for reliable impurity removal.  
- Quick and effortless installation process.  

**Compatibility with Water Pitchers**  

These filters aren’t universal, which may limit their appeal. While they fit my pitcher perfectly, I can see how this could frustrate others using less common brands. Before purchasing, double-check your pitcher compatibility, as these filters are specifically designed for Cuisinart models. It felt like a perfect match for mine, but I did have to confirm that beforehand. I’ve read online from other reviews that trying to force these into non-compatible pitchers can even damage them.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited to specific pitcher models—check compatibility first.  
- Short user manual, which might confuse first-timers.  

**Material Quality and Build**  

The blend of nonwoven polyester and activated charcoal used in these filters truly stands out. It feels premium to the touch, and the thoughtful material choice ensures durability while maintaining functionality. After consistent daily use for over two weeks, I haven’t noticed any signs of wear or degradation. These materials do more than just look good—they actively work to enhance water taste and clarity.  

**Critiques**  
- Filters do require priming, which some might view as an extra step.  
- Packaging wasn’t eco-friendly—room for improvement there.  

**Competing Products**  

When comparing it to other filters on the market like Brita or ZeroWater replacements, the Cuisinart filters hold their own. While Brita offers a broader compatibility range, these filters outperform in terms of ease of installation and overall water taste. On the downside, Brita packs often provide more than two filters, which might seem like better value for larger households. ZeroWater, known for its impressive multi-step filtration, does provide a slight edge with finer filtering, but that also comes at a significant price premium. For everyday use without breaking the bank, the Cuisinart filters find a solid balance.  

**Cost Efficiency**  

When it comes to financial value, this set of two filters proves to be a wise choice for its performance level. While you’ll occasionally come across cheaper options, those are usually riddled with compromises like poor construction, inconsistent quality, or subpar filtration. The cost-to-quality ratio here feels remarkably justified, especially if you prioritize consistent water clarity and taste. Considering the longevity and effectiveness of the materials used, I'd argue these filters are worth their asking price, even if some alternatives might tempt budget-focused buyers.
