1mg9ezz,https://i.redd.it/lu6anau27qgf1.jpeg,Orange you glad etoupe is a neutral?,"Buckle up friends, this is a long one! 

I figured that I was done for the year, checked myself into a penthouse suite on ban island and everything. Apparently my SA had other plans and I subconsciously manifested my way into what I *think* is really my last bag for the year. 

I got a text from my SA asking me to pop in and see them this weekend, I figured my housewares and RTW order was here. So silly me, dragged my husband out for brunch and a drive by to pick up. When we got there we puttered around while SA was wrapping up with a big group that had walked in. We headed downstairs after and caught up on what was new, how we were doing etc. my husband always has a coffee when we come in, so they said let‚Äôs go into the room because ‚Äúwe got the cute sugars in!‚Äù Apparently people are insane with these and the cookies and take advantage of them, aka grab handfuls to take home. 

I thought it was weird, but weirder things have happened. So I‚Äôm sitting there sipping on my water and eyeing the cute sugars, when they walk in with some boxes. We unbox the plates, the bowls, the cups, etc. Finally, they ask if there was anything else I wanted to look at today. I asked about rodeo/pegasus which there were none. I asked about fruit plates, but we‚Äôre still waiting those to come in. So I say, nope! I‚Äôm ready. But SA is still staring at me with the widest grin on their face. 

They get up and start to open a box‚Ä¶ and out comes a B25 in Etoupe. The color I‚Äôve always been on the fence with, the color that I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want, the color all my friends and everyone goes crazy for‚Ä¶ the bag I apparently didn‚Äôt know I wanted. I *did* however know that I wanted a B25 eventually, so in preparation for the tariffs, I bought some bag insets and pillows for things I knew I would eventually have on my wishlist or already had in my closet. So in that order‚Ä¶ I bought a B25 pillow and insert that have been tucked away, until that bag came into my life.  

So, I‚Äôm officially done for the year, I‚Äôve hit all bag maxes for the year and I told my SA I‚Äôll see them around Christmas and I‚Äôm checking back onto ban island ü§£. Their response was a wink‚Ä¶ not sure where that will go, but we‚Äôll see lol!

My journey so far has been bumpy, included an SA change, frustration and plenty of bags and fun times. If anyone has any questions, outside of ‚Äúwhat was your exact prespend‚Äù, please let me know and I‚Äôm happy to share what knowledge I have.

1mg9dt8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mg9dt8,The 5 Non-Negotiable Numbers Every Founder Needs to Know BEFORE Breakfast,"It‚Äôs 7 AM. The coffee is brewing. Before the first email is opened, before the first Slack notification pings, before the day‚Äôs chaos truly begins, the most successful founders in the world have already checked the pulse of their business.

They‚Äôre not diving into a 50-tab spreadsheet or a dense accounting report. They‚Äôre looking at a handful of numbers. Five, to be exact.

I remember a client, let‚Äôs call her Sarah, a brilliant founder of a subscription box company. She was passionate, her product was fantastic, and her customer feedback was glowing. But she was perpetually stressed. She was working 80-hour weeks, sales were coming in, yet she always felt like she was on the verge of financial collapse. Why? She was drowning in data but starved for wisdom. She was tracking everything and therefore, knew nothing.

Her ""aha!"" moment came when we cut through the noise. We ignored the vanity metrics and focused on a few core indicators. We boiled down the complex world of **Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A)** into a simple, daily habit. This shift didn't just lower her anxiety; it transformed her decision-making and, ultimately, saved her business.

You don‚Äôt need an MBA to be a financially savvy founder. You just need to know what to look at. These five non-negotiable **business metrics** are your daily health check. They are your compass, your early-warning system, and your key to unlocking sustainable growth. Know them before breakfast, and you‚Äôll own the rest of your day.

# 1. Cash Runway: Your Oxygen Tank

**What it is:** In the simplest terms, **Cash Runway** is how many months your business can survive before you run out of money, assuming your current income and expenses stay the same.

**Why it‚Äôs non-negotiable:** Cash is the oxygen for your business. When you run out, everything else dies. Sales, marketing, product development‚Äînone of it matters if you can‚Äôt pay your bills. Knowing your runway isn‚Äôt about being pessimistic; it‚Äôs about being a realist. It tells you when you need to raise funds, cut costs, or push harder on sales. It turns panic into a plan.

**How to calculate it:** `Cash Runway (in months) = Current Cash Balance / Monthly Net Burn Rate`

Your ""Net Burn"" is the total amount of money you're losing each month. `Net Burn = Monthly Revenue - Monthly Expenses`

**Example in Action:** Let‚Äôs say you run a small graphic design agency.

* **Current Cash in the Bank:** $60,000
* **Average Monthly Revenue:** $20,000
* **Total Monthly Expenses (salaries, software, rent, etc.):** $25,000

Your **Monthly Net Burn** is $20,000 - $25,000 = -$5,000. You're losing $5,000 per month. Your **Cash Runway** is $60,000 / $5,000 = 12 months.

You have one year of oxygen. This single number is one of the most powerful **KPIs** you can have. It tells you that you have 12 months to either increase your revenue by $5,000 a month or cut costs to become profitable. You can now make strategic decisions, not desperate ones.

**Best Practices:**

* **Check it weekly, know it daily.** This number can change fast. A big new client or an unexpected expense can alter your runway overnight.
* **Be brutally honest with expenses.** Don't forget taxes, credit card fees, or that software subscription you barely use.
* **Aim for at least 6-12 months of runway.** This gives you room to breathe and navigate unforeseen challenges. For early-stage startups, 18 months is often the goal.

# 2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Your Growth Engine's Fuel Cost

**What it is:** **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** is the total cost of sales and marketing to acquire a single new paying customer over a specific period.

**Why it‚Äôs non-negotiable:** Any business can get customers by throwing enough money at the problem. But is that growth profitable? Is it sustainable? Your CAC tells you exactly how much you have to spend to get one person to buy from you. If this number is too high, you could be selling your way into bankruptcy.

**How to calculate it:** `CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Costs / Number of New Customers Acquired`

**Example in Action:** Imagine you own a local coffee shop. Last month, you tried a new marketing push.

* **Facebook Ad Spend:** $500
* **Flyer Printing & Distribution:** $200
* **Time spent on marketing (your hourly rate):** 5 hours at $40/hr = $200
* **Total Sales & Marketing Costs:** $500 + $200 + $200 = $900

Through these efforts, you can directly attribute **90 new customers** who used a special offer code from the ads and flyers. Your **CAC** is $900 / 90 = $10.

It costs you $10 to get a new person to walk in and make their first purchase. Is that good or bad? You can't know without the next metric.

**Best Practices:**

* **Track by channel.** What‚Äôs the CAC for customers from Google Ads vs. Instagram vs. trade shows? This tells you where to double down and what to cut.
* **Include** ***all*** **costs.** Don‚Äôt forget salaries of your marketing team, software tools (e.g., Mailchimp, HubSpot), and even the cost of ""free"" trials if applicable.
* **Constantly test and optimize.** The goal is to lower your CAC over time by finding more efficient ways to reach your ideal customer.

# 3. Lifetime Value (LTV): Is Your Growth Profitable?

**What it is:** **Lifetime Value (LTV)**, sometimes called Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), is the total revenue you can reasonably expect from a single customer throughout their entire relationship with your business.

**Why it‚Äôs non-negotiable:** LTV is the other half of the growth equation. It tells you what a customer is *worth* to you. When you compare your LTV to your CAC, you get a crystal-clear picture of your business model's viability. A healthy business has an LTV that is significantly higher than its CAC.

**How to calculate it:** There are complex ways, but here‚Äôs a simple, powerful one: `LTV = Average Purchase Value x Average Purchase Frequency x Average Customer Lifespan`

**Example in Action:** Let's go back to our coffee shop with its $10 CAC.

* The **Average Purchase Value** (average spend per visit) is $7.
* The **Average Purchase Frequency** is that a loyal customer comes in 3 times a month.
* The **Average Customer Lifespan** is that you tend to keep a customer for about 2 years (24 months).

Your **LTV** is $7 x 3 purchases/month x 24 months = $504.

Now for the magic: The **LTV to CAC Ratio**. Your ratio is $504 (LTV) to $10 (CAC), or roughly 50:1. This is incredibly healthy! It means for every $10 you spend to get a new customer, you can expect to get over $500 back. You should be running those ads all day long.

If your CAC was $300? Your ratio would be less than 2:1. That‚Äôs a red flag. You're paying too much for customers who aren't worth enough to you over time.

**Best Practices:**

* **A 3:1 LTV to CAC ratio is considered a good benchmark.** Less than that, and you're likely losing money. Much more than that, and you might be under-investing in marketing and growing too slowly.
* **Focus on increasing LTV.** It's often cheaper to get current customers to spend more than to acquire new ones. Focus on great service, loyalty programs, and upselling to boost this number.
* **Segment your customers.** Your LTV might be different for different types of customers. Identify your most valuable segment and find more people like them.

# 4. Gross Margin: The Health of Your Core Offer

**What it is:** **Gross Margin** reveals the profitability of your core product or service itself, before any overhead or operating expenses are taken out. It‚Äôs what‚Äôs left over from a sale after subtracting the direct costs of creating and delivering that product or service.

**Why it‚Äôs non-negotiable:** This metric tells you if your fundamental business model works. If you have a low gross margin, it means the very thing you sell isn't generating enough profit to support the rest of the business (like marketing, rent, and your own salary). No amount of sales volume can fix a fundamentally broken gross margin.

**How to calculate it:** First, find your Gross Profit: `Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)` Then, your Gross Margin: `Gross Margin (%) = (Gross Profit / Revenue) x 100`

**COGS** includes the direct costs to produce what you sell. For a product, it's materials and direct labor. For a service, it's the direct labor cost of the people delivering the service.

**Example in Action:** Let's look at a small, independent software (SaaS) business.

* **Monthly Subscription Revenue:** $30,000
* **COGS:** This includes server hosting costs ($2,000), third-party API fees ($500), and the portion of customer support salaries directly serving existing customers ($2,500). Total COGS = $5,000.

**Gross Profit** = $30,000 - $5,000 = $25,000 **Gross Margin** = ($25,000 / $30,000) x 100 = 83.3%

This is a very healthy gross margin, typical for software. It means that for every dollar in sales, 83 cents are available to pay for operating costs (like new feature development, marketing, admin) and, eventually, become net profit. If this number were 20%, the business would be in serious trouble.

**Best Practices:**

* **Know your industry benchmark.** A 10% gross margin might be great for a grocery store, but it would be catastrophic for a consulting firm.
* **Track it over time.** A declining gross margin is a major red flag. It could mean your supplier costs are rising, or you're discounting too heavily.
* **Look for ways to improve it.** Can you negotiate better prices with suppliers? Can you make your service delivery more efficient? Can you raise your prices?

# 5. Your One Key Metric (OKM): Your North Star

**What it is:** This isn't a universal financial metric like the others. It's the one **business metric** that, more than anything else, tells you if you are delivering value to your customers. It‚Äôs often activity-based, not financial. It‚Äôs your ""North Star.""

**Why it‚Äôs non-negotiable:** The first four numbers tell you about the health of your business engine. This number tells you if your car is actually *going* somewhere your passengers want to be. A focus on an OKM aligns your entire team around a single, clear goal: creating happy, engaged customers. When your OKM goes up, your financial metrics will eventually follow.

**Examples in Action:**

* For **Facebook** in the early days, it was ""the number of users who add 7 friends in their first 10 days."" They knew this action created sticky, long-term users.
* For **Airbnb**, it‚Äôs ""nights booked."" This captures value for both hosts and guests.
* For a **SaaS company**, it might be ""Daily Active Users"" or ""Number of Invoices Created.""
* For our **subscription box company**, it could be ""monthly retention rate.""
* For our **coffee shop**, it could be ""number of loyalty card sign-ups per week.""

**How to find yours:** Ask yourself this question: **What is the single action that best represents a user getting value from my product or service?** The answer is your OKM.

**Best Practices:**

* **Make it visible.** Put your OKM on a dashboard, a whiteboard, or in a company-wide email. Everyone should know the score.
* **Focus your team on it.** When planning a new feature or marketing campaign, ask, ""How will this move our One Key Metric?""
* **Don't be afraid to change it.** As your business evolves, your North Star might shift. That's okay. The key is to always have one.

# From Numbers to Ritual

Knowing these five numbers is only half the battle. The real magic happens when you build a ritual around them. You don't need fancy software. A simple whiteboard or a locked Google Sheet will do.

Every morning, before the world pulls you in a million directions, take five minutes.

1. Look at your **Cash Runway**. *Are we safe?*
2. Look at your **LTV:CAC ratio**. *Is our growth profitable?*
3. Look at your **Gross Margin**. *Is our core offering healthy?*
4. Look at your **One Key Metric**. *Are we delivering value?*

Answering these questions daily transforms you from a reactive firefighter into a proactive architect of your business. It simplifies the complex, focuses your energy, and gives you the confidence to make the bold decisions that will truly move the needle. Stop drowning. Start swimming. Your future self will thank you for it.

¬† PROSPERITY  
  
¬† Kate Harker hit the ground running.  
  
¬† Blood dripped from a shallow cut on her calf, and her lungs were sore from the blow she‚Äôd taken to the chest. Thank God for armor, even if it was makeshift.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTurn right.‚Äù  
  
¬† Her boots slid on the slick pavement as she rounded the corner onto a side street. She swore when she saw it was full of people, restaurant canopies up and tables out despite the brewing storm.  
  
¬† Teo‚Äôs voice rose in her ear. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs catching up.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate backtracked and took off down the main road. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want a mass casualty event, find me somewhere else.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHalf a block, then cut right,‚Äù said Bea, and Kate felt like the avatar in some multiplayer game where a girl was chased by monsters through a massive city. Only this massive city was real‚Äîthe capital at the heart of Prosperity‚Äîand so were the monsters. Well, monster. She‚Äôd taken out one, but a second was heading her way.  
  
¬† The shadows wicked around her as she ran. A chill twisted through the damp night and fat drops of rain dripped under her collar and down her back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLeft up ahead,‚Äù instructed Bea, and Kate bolted past a row of shops and down an alley, leaving a trail of fear and blood like bread crumbs in her wake. She reached a narrow lot and a wall, only it wasn‚Äôt a wall, but a warehouse door, and for a split second she was back in the abandoned building in the Waste, cuffed to a bar in a blacked-out room while somewhere beyond the door, metal struck bone and someone‚Äî  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLeft.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate blinked the memory away as Bea repeated her instruction. But she was sick of running, and the door was ajar, so she went straight, out of the rain and into the vacant space.  
  
¬† There were no windows in the warehouse, no light at all save that from the street behind her, which reached only a few feet‚Äîthe rest of the steel structure was plunged into solid black. Kate‚Äôs pulse pounded in her head as she cracked a glorified glow stick‚ÄîLiam‚Äôs idea‚Äîand tossed it into the shadows, flooding the warehouse with steady white light.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúKate . . . ,‚Äù chimed in Riley for the first time. ‚ÄúBe careful.‚Äù  
  
¬† She snorted. Count on Riley to give useless advice. She scanned the warehouse, spotted crates piled within reach of the steel rafters overhead, and started to climb, hauling herself the last of the way up just as the door rattled on its hinges.  
  
¬† Kate froze.  
  
¬† She held her breath as fingers‚Äînot flesh and bone, but something else‚Äîcurled around the door and slid it open.  
  
¬† Static sounded in her good ear.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStatus?‚Äù asked Liam nervously.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúBusy,‚Äù she hissed, balancing on the rafters as the monster filled the doorway, and for an instant, Kate imagined Sloan‚Äôs red eyes, his shining fangs, his dark suit.  
  
¬† Come out, little Katherine, he‚Äôd say. Let‚Äôs play a game.  
  
¬† The sweat on her skin chilled, but it was just her mind playing tricks on her‚Äîthe creature edging forward into the warehouse wasn‚Äôt a Malchai. It was something else entirely.  
  
¬† It had a Malchai‚Äôs red eyes, yes, and a Corsai‚Äôs sharp claws, but its skin was the bluish black of a rotting corpse, and it wasn‚Äôt after flesh or blood.  
  
¬† It fed on hearts.  
  
¬† Kate didn‚Äôt know why she‚Äôd assumed the monsters would be the same. Verity had its triad, but here she had only come across a single kind. So far.  
  
¬† Then again, Verity boasted the highest crime rate of all ten territories‚Äîthanks in large part, she was sure, to her father‚Äîwhile Prosperity‚Äôs sins were harder to place. On the books, Prosperity was the wealthiest territory by half, but it was a robust economy rotting from the inside out.  
  
¬† If Verity‚Äôs sins were knives, quick and vicious, then Prosperity‚Äôs were poison. Slow, insidious, but just as deadly. And when the violence began to coalesce into something tangible, something monstrous, it didn‚Äôt happen all at once, as in Verity, but in a drip, slow enoug  
h that most of the city was still pretending the monsters weren‚Äôt real.  
  
¬† The thing in the warehouse suggested otherwise.  
  
¬† The monster inhaled, as though trying to smell her, a chilling reminder of which of them was the predator and which, for the moment, was prey. Fear scraped along her spine as its head swung from side to side. And then it looked up. At her.  
  
¬† Kate didn‚Äôt wait.  
  
¬† She dropped down, catching herself on the steel rafter to ease the fall. She landed in a crouch between the monster and the warehouse door, spikes flashing in her hands, each the length of her forearm and filed to a vicious point.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLooking for me?‚Äù  
  
¬† The creature turned, flashing two dozen blue-black teeth in a feral grimace.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúKate?‚Äù pressed Teo. ‚ÄúYou see it?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she said dryly. ‚ÄúI see it.‚Äù  
  
¬† Bea and Liam both started talking, but Kate tapped her ear and the voices dropped out, replaced a second later by a strong beat, a heavy bass. The music filled her head, drowning out her fear and her doubt and her pulse and every other useless thing.  
  
¬† The monster curled its long fingers, and Kate braced herself‚Äîthe first one had tried to punch right through her chest (she‚Äôd have the bruises to prove it). But the attack didn‚Äôt come.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù she chided, her voice lost beneath the beat. ‚ÄúIs my heart not good enough?‚Äù  
  
¬† She had wondered, briefly, in the beginning, if the crimes written on her soul would somehow make her less appetizing.  
  
¬† Apparently not.  
  
¬† A second later, the monster lunged.  
  
¬† Kate was always surprised to discover that monsters were fast.  
  
¬† No matter how big.  
  
¬† No matter how ugly.  
  
¬† She dodged back, quick on her feet.  
  
¬† Five years‚Äô and six private schools‚Äô worth of self-defense had given her a head start, but the last six months hunting down things that went bump in Prosperity‚Äîthat had been the real education.  
  
¬† She danced between blows, trying to avoid the monster‚Äôs claws and get under its guard.  
  
¬† Nails raked the air above Kate‚Äôs head as she ducked and slashed the iron spike across the creature‚Äôs outstretched hand.  
  
¬† It snarled and swung at her, recoiling only after its claws bit into her sleeve and hit copper mesh beneath. The armor absorbed most of the damage, but Kate still hissed as somewhere on her arm the skin parted and blood welled up.  
  
¬† She let out a curse and drove her boot into the creature‚Äôs chest.  
  
¬† It was twice her size, made of hunger and gore and God knew what else, but the sole of her shoe was plated with iron, and the creature went staggering backward, clawing at itself as the pure metal burned away a stretch of mottled flesh, exposing the thick membrane that shielded its heart.  
  
¬† Bull‚Äôs-eye.  
  
¬† Kate launched herself forward, aiming for the still-sizzling mark. The spike punched through cartilage and muscle before sinking easily into that vital core.  
  
¬† Funny, she thought, that even monsters had fragile hearts.  
  
¬† Her momentum carried her forward, and the monster fell back, and they went down together, its body collapsing beneath her into a mound of gore and rot. Kate staggered to her feet, holding her breath against the noxious fumes until she reached the warehouse door. She slumped against it, pressing a palm to the gash on her arm.  
  
¬† The song was ending in her ear, and she switched the feed back to Control.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow long has it been?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWe have to do something.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù  
  
¬† A string of profanity.  
  
¬† A few stock lines of relief.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúStatus?‚Äù asked Bea.  
  
¬† Kate pulled the cell from her pocket, snapped a photo of the gory slick on the concrete, and hit SEND.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù answered Bea.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWicked,‚Äù said Liam.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLooks fake,‚Äù offered Teo.  
  
¬† Riley sounded queasy. ‚ÄúDo they always . . . fall apart?‚Äù  
  
¬† The litany in her ear was just another reminder that these people had no business being on this end of the fight. They had their purpose, but they weren‚Äôt like her. Weren‚Äôt hunters.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow about you, Kate?‚Äù asked Riley. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù  
  
¬† Blood soaked her calf and dripped from her fingers, and truth be told, she felt a little dizzy, but Riley was human‚Äîshe didn‚Äôt have to tell him the truth.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPeachy,‚Äù she said, killing the call before any of them could hear the catch in her breath. The glow stick flickered and faded, plunging her back into the dark.  
  
¬† But she didn‚Äôt mind.  
  
¬† It was empty now.  
  
¬† Kate climbed the stairs, leaving drops of gray water in her wake. The rain had started up again halfway back to the apartment, and she‚Äôd relished the soaking despite the cold, letting it wash away the worst of the black blood and gore.  
  
¬† Even so, she still looked like she‚Äôd gotten in a fight with a jar of ink‚Äîand lost.  
  
¬† She reached the third-floor landing and let herself in.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHoney, I‚Äôm home.‚Äù  
  
¬† No answer, of course. She was crashing in Riley‚Äôs apartment‚Äîan apartment his parents paid for‚Äîwhile he was off ‚Äúliving in sin‚Äù with his boyfriend, Malcolm. She remembered seeing the place for the first time‚Äîthe exposed brick, the art, the overstuffed furniture designed for comfort‚Äîand thinking Riley‚Äôs parents clearly shopped in a different catalog than Callum Harker.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd never lived alone before.  
  
¬† The school dorms had always been two-to-a-room, and back at Harker Hall, she‚Äôd had her father, at least in theory. And his shadow, Sloan. She‚Äôd always assumed she‚Äôd relish the eventual privacy, the freedom, but it turned out that being alone lost some of its charm when you didn‚Äôt have a choice.  
  
¬† She smothered the wave of self-pity before it could crest and headed for the bathroom, peeling off her armor as she went. Armor was a pretty fancy word for the copper mesh stretched over paintball gear, but Liam‚Äôs combined interests in costume design and war games did the job . . . 90 percent of the time. The other 10, well, that was just sharp claws and bad luck.  
  
¬† She caught her reflection in the bathroom mirror‚Äîdamp blond hair slicked back, black gore freckling pale cheeks‚Äîand met her own gaze.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhere are you?‚Äù she murmured, wondering how other Kates in other lives were spending their night. She‚Äôd always liked the idea that there was a different you for every choice you made and every choice you didn‚Äôt, and somewhere out there were Kates who had never returned to Verity and never begged to leave.  
  
¬† Ones who could still hear out of both ears and had two parents instead of none.  
  
¬† Ones who hadn‚Äôt run, hadn‚Äôt killed, hadn‚Äôt lost everything.  
  
¬† Where are you?  
  
¬† Once upon a time, the first image in her head would have been the house beyond the Waste, with its high grass and its wide-open sky. Now it was the woods behind Colton, an apple in her hand and birdsong overhead, and a boy who wasn‚Äôt a boy with his back against a tree.  
  
¬† She turned the shower on, wincing as she peeled away the last of the fabric.  
  
¬† Steam bloomed across the glass, and she bit back a groan as hot water struck raw skin. She leaned against the tiles and thought of another city, another house, another shower.  
  
¬† A monster slumped in the bath.  
  
¬† A boy burning from the inside out.  
  
¬† Her hand wrapped around his.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm not going to let you fall.  
  
¬† As the scalding water ran gray and rust red and then finally clear, she considered her skin. She was becoming a patchwork of scars. From the teardrop in the corner of her eye and the pale line that ran from temple to jaw‚Äîmarks of the car crash that had killed her mother‚Äîto the curve of a Malchai‚Äôs teeth along her shoulder and the silvery gash of a Corsai‚Äôs claws across her ribs.  
  
¬† And then there was the mark she couldn‚Äôt see.  
  
¬† The one she‚Äôd made herself when she raised her father‚Äôs gun and pulled the trigger and killed a stranger, staining her soul red.  
  
¬† Kate sna  
pped the water off.  
  
¬† As she taped up her latest cuts, she wondered if, somewhere, there was a version of herself having fun. Feet up on the back of a theater seat while movie monsters slunk out of the shadows, and people in the audience screamed because it was fun to be afraid when you knew you were safe.  
  
¬† It shouldn‚Äôt make her feel better, imagining those other lives, but it did. One of those paths led to happiness, even while Kate‚Äôs own had led her here.  
  
¬† But here, she told herself, was exactly where she was supposed to be.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd spent five years trying to become the daughter her father wanted‚Äîstrong, hard, monstrous‚Äîonly to learn that her father didn‚Äôt want her at all.  
  
¬† But he was dead, and Kate wasn‚Äôt, and she‚Äôd had to find something to do, someone to be, some way to put all those skills to use.  
  
¬† And she knew it wasn‚Äôt enough‚Äîno matter how many monsters she slayed, it wouldn‚Äôt undo the one she‚Äôd made, wouldn‚Äôt erase the red from her soul‚Äîbut life only moved forward.  
  
¬† And here in Prosperity, Kate had found a purpose, a point, and now when she met her gaze in the mirror, she didn‚Äôt see a girl who was sad or lonely or lost. She saw a girl who wasn‚Äôt afraid of the dark.  
  
¬† She saw a girl who hunted monsters.  
  
¬† And she was damn good at it.  
  
¬† Hunger gnawed at Kate‚Äôs bones, but she was too tired to go in search of food. She turned the radio up and slumped onto the couch, sighing at the simple comfort of clean hair and a soft sweatshirt.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd never been all that sentimental, but living out of a duffel bag taught you to value the things you had. The sweatshirt was from Leighton, the third of her six boarding schools. She had no fondness for the school itself, but the sweatshirt was worn and warm, a little piece of a past life. She didn‚Äôt let herself cling to these pieces, holding on just tight enough that they wouldn‚Äôt slip away. Besides, the Leighton colors were forest green and cool gray, way better than St. Agnes‚Äôs horror show of red and purple and brown.  
  
¬† She booted up her tablet and logged into the private chat space Bea had carved out in the infinite world of Prosperity‚Äôs opendrive.  
  
¬† Welcome to the Wardens, said the screen.That was the name they‚Äôd chosen for themselves‚ÄîLiam and Bea and Teo‚Äîbefore Kate ever showed up. Riley hadn‚Äôt been a part of it, either‚Äînot until she brought him in.  
  
¬† LiamonMe: hahahahahahaha wolves  
  
¬† TeoMuchtoHandle: it‚Äôs a cover-up. everyone knows what happened in verity.  
  
¬† Beatch: See no evil ‚Üí hear no evil ‚Üí tell yourself there‚Äôs no evil  
  
¬† LiamonMe: dunno I had a mean-ass cat once  
  
¬† For a moment, Kate just stared at the screen and asked herself for the hundredth time what she was doing here, talking to these people. Letting them in. She hated that part of her craved this simple contact, even looked forward to it.  
  
¬† RiledUp: Did you guys catch that headline about the explosion on Broad?  
  
¬† Kate hadn‚Äôt gone looking for friends‚Äîshe‚Äôd never played well with others, never stayed in a school long enough to make any real connections.  
  
¬† RiledUp: Guy walked into his apartment, pulled the gas line straight out of the wall.  
  
¬† Sure, Kate understood the value of friends, the social currency of being part of a group, but she‚Äôd never gotten the emotional appeal. Friends wanted you to be honest. Friends wanted you to share. Friends wanted you to listen and care and worry and do a dozen other things Kate had no time for.  
  
¬† All she‚Äôd wanted was a lead.  
  
¬† RiledUp: Roommate was home when it happened.  
  
¬† Kate had landed in Prosperity six months ago with that one duffel, five hundred in cash, and a bad feeling that got worse with every piece of news. Dog attacks. Gang violence. Suspicious activity. Brutal acts. Suspects at large. Crime scenes disturbed. Weapons missing.  
  
¬† LiamonMe: Creepy.  
  
¬† Beatch: Downer, Riley.  
  
¬† A dozen stories all sporting the telltale signs‚Äîthe kind made by teeth and claws‚Äîand then there were the whispers on the opendrive, referencing the same place, the name scraping over skin: Verity.  
  
¬† But short of putting an EAT ME sign on her back and wandering the streets at night, Kate wasn‚Äôt exactly sure where to start. Finding monsters had never been a problem in Verity, but here, for every actual sighting there were a hundred trolls and conspiracy theorists co-opting the threads. It was a needle in a haystack where a bunch of idiots were shouting, SOMETHING POKED ME.  
  
¬† But there, threaded through the static, she noticed them. The same voices showing up over and over, trying to be heard. They called themselves the Wardens, and they weren‚Äôt hunters, but hackers‚Äîhacktivists, according to Liam‚Äîconvinced that the authorities were either incompetent or determined to bury the news.  
  
¬† The Wardens scoured sites and dug through footage, flagging anything that looked suspicious, then leaked the data to the press and plastered it on the threads, trying to get someone to listen.  
  
¬† And Kate had.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd taken one of their leads and run with it, and when it had panned out, she‚Äôd gone to the source for more. And that‚Äôs when she‚Äôd learned that the Wardens were just a couple of college students and a fourteen-year-old who never slept.  
  
¬† TeoMuchtoHandle: yeah, that‚Äôs sad. but what does that have to do with Heart Eaters?  
  
¬† Beatch: Since when are we calling them Heart Eaters?  
  
¬† LiamonMe: Since they started eating hearts duh.  
  
¬† She still didn‚Äôt want friends. But despite her best efforts, she was getting to know them. Bea, who was addicted to dark chocolate and wanted to be a research scientist. Teo, who never sat still, even had a treadmill desk in his dorm. Liam, who lived with his grandparents and cared too much for his own good. Riley, whose family would kill him if they knew where he spent his nights.  
  
¬† And what did they know about her?  
  
¬† Nothing but a name, and even that was only half true.  
  
¬† To the Wardens, she was Kate Gallagher, a runaway with a knack for hunting monsters. She kept her first name even though the sound of that one syllable made her jump every time, sure that someone from her past had caught up. But it was all she had left. Her mother was dead. Her father was dead. Sloan was dead. The only one who‚Äôd say her name with any sense of knowing was August, and he was hundreds of miles away in Verity, at the center of a city on fire.  
  
¬† Beatch: Makes a hell of a lot more sense than Corsai, Malchai, Sunai. Who named those?  
  
¬† TeoMuchtoHandle: no idea.  
  
¬† Beatch: Your lack of professional curiosity is maddening.  
  
¬† The Wardens had nagged Kate for months to meet up in person, and when the time came she‚Äôd almost bailed. She‚Äôd watched them from across the street, all looking so . . . normal. Not that they blended in‚ÄîTeo had short blue hair and Bea had a full sleeve of tattoos and Liam, in his giant orange glasses, looked like he was twelve‚Äîbut they didn‚Äôt look like something spit out of Verity. They weren‚Äôt Flynn Task Force soldiers. Or coddled Colton kids. They were just‚Äînormal. They had lives outside this one. Things to lose.  
  
¬† LiamonMe: Why not just call them what they are, what they do? Body Eaters, Blood Eaters, and Soul Eaters. BAM.  
  
¬† Kate pictured August down in the subway, dark lashes fluttering as he raised his violin, the music pouring out where bow met strings, transfigured into threads of burning light. Calling him a Soul Eater was like calling the sun bright. Technically accurate, but only a fraction of the truth.  
  
¬† RiledUp: Any sign of Kate?  
  
¬† She switched from incognito to public.  
  
¬† HunterK has joined the chat.  
  
¬† Beatch: Heyo!  
  
¬† TeoMuchToHandle: stalker.  
  
¬† RiledUp: I was getting worried.  
  
¬† LiamOnMe: Not me!  
  
¬† Beatch: Yeah right, Mr. I-know-karate.  
  
¬† Kate‚Äôs fingers danced over the screen.  
  
¬† HunterK: No need. Still standing.  
  
¬† RiledUp: You really shouldn‚Äôt go dark without properly signing off.  
  
¬† TeoMuchToHandle: oooh, riley‚Äôs in dad mode.  
  
¬† Dad mode.  
  
¬† Kate thought of her own father, the cuffs of his suit stained with blood, the sea of monsters at his feet, the smug look on his face right before she put a bullet in his leg.  
  
¬† But she knew what Teo meant‚ÄîRiley wasn‚Äôt like the rest of the Wardens. He wouldn‚Äôt even be there if it wasn‚Äôt for her. He was a grad student, studying law at the university and interning at the local police department, which was the part that mattered to the Wardens, since it meant access to police surveillance and intel briefings‚Äînot that Teo couldn‚Äôt hack them, as he‚Äôd pointed out a dozen times, but why kick down an open door?  
  
¬† (According to Riley, the police were ‚Äúaware of the attacks and continuing to monitor developments,‚Äù which as far as Kate could tell was just a long way of describing denial.)  
  
¬† RiledUp: \*makes dad face\* \*wags finger\*  
  
¬† RiledUp: But seriously. You better not get any blood on my couch.  
  
¬† HunterK: Don‚Äôt worry.  
  
¬† HunterK: I left most of it on the stairs.  
  
¬† LiamOnMe: O\_O.  
  
¬† HunterK: Any new leads?  
  
¬† TeoMuchtoHandle: nothing yet. the streets are quiet.  
  
¬† What a strange idea.  
  
¬† If she could keep this up, knocking out the Heart Eaters as they took shape instead of cleaning up the wreckage, two steps forward instead of back, maybe it wouldn‚Äôt get worse. Maybe she could keep it from becoming a Phenomenon. Maybe‚Äîwhat a useless word. Maybe was just a way of saying she didn‚Äôt know.  
  
¬† And Kate hated not knowing.  
  
¬† She closed the browser, fingers hesitating over the darkened screen before she opened a new window and started searching for Verity.  
  
¬† Kate had first learned how to tap into foreign signals at her second boarding school, out on the eastern fringe of Verity, an hour from the Temperance border.  
  
¬† All ten territories were supposed to transmit openly, but if you wanted to know what was really going on in another territory, you had to slip behind the digital curtain.  
  
¬† That was the idea‚Äîbut no matter how hard Kate looked, she couldn‚Äôt find her way home.  
  
¬† True, the quarantine had gone back into effect, the borders that had peeled open so slowly over the last decade slamming shut again. But there was no curta  
in to slip behind, nothing coming out of Verity at all.  
  
¬† The signal was gone.  
  
¬† There was only one explanation: the tech towers must have gone down.  
  
¬† With the borders closed and the comm grid out, Verity was officially cut off.  
  
¬† And the people in Prosperity didn‚Äôt care. Not even the Wardens‚ÄîTeo had used the word inevitable. Bea thought the borders should never have been opened, that Verity should have been left to consume itself like a fire in a glass jar. Even Riley seemed ambivalent. Only Liam showed the slightest concern, and it was more pity than a vested interest. They didn‚Äôt know, of course, what Verity meant to Kate.  
  
¬† Hell, Kate didn‚Äôt know either.  
  
¬† But she couldn‚Äôt stop searching.  
  
¬† Every night she checked, just in case, clicked through every bread crumb on the opendrive, hoping for some news about Verity, about August Flynn.  
  
¬† It was the weirdest thing‚Äîshe‚Äôd seen August at his worst. Watched him descend through hunger into sickness and madness and shadow. Watched him burn. Watched him kill.  
  
¬† But when she pictured him now, she didn‚Äôt see the Sunai made of smoke or the figure burning in a cold tub. She saw a sad-eyed boy sitting alone on the bleachers, a violin case at his feet.  
  
¬† Kate shoved the tablet away and slumped back on the couch. She threw an arm over her eyes and let the steady beat of the radio fold around her until she sank down toward sleep.  
  
¬† But then, in the lull between songs, the sound of footsteps echoed in the stairwell. She stilled, turning her good ear toward the door as the steps slowed, stopped.  
  
¬† Kate waited for a knock, but it never came. Instead she heard the sound of a hand on the doorknob, the shudder of the lock as it was tried but held fast. Kate‚Äôs fingers slipped beneath the couch cushion and produced a gun. The same one she‚Äôd used to kill a stranger in her mother‚Äôs house, the same one she‚Äôd used to shoot her father in his office.  
  
¬† A muffled voice sounded beyond the door, followed by the scrape of metal, and Kate leveled the weapon at the door as it swung open.  
  
¬† For a moment, the shape in the doorway was nothing but a shadow, the hall lights tracing the outline of a figure a fraction taller than she was, with round edges and short hair. No red eyes, no sharp teeth, no dark suit. Just Riley, standing there, juggling a box of pizza and a six-pack of soda and a key.  
  
¬† He saw the gun and threw his hands up, dropping the cardboard and the cans and the key ring to the floor. One of the cans exploded, raining soda on the landing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDammit, Kate.‚Äù His voice was strangled.  
  
¬† Kate sighed and set the weapon on the table. ‚ÄúYou should knock.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThis is my place,‚Äù he said, retrieving the pizza box and the rest of the soda with shaking hands. ‚ÄúDo you pull the gun on everyone, or just me?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúEveryone,‚Äù said Kate, ‚Äúbut for you I left the safety on.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm flattered.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, you know,‚Äù he shot back, ‚Äúchecking on the squatter in my apartment, making sure she didn‚Äôt trash the place.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou wanted to see if I bled on the couch.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúAnd the stairs.‚Äù His gaze flicked from her to the gun on the table and back. ‚ÄúPermission to enter?‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate spread her arms along the back of the couch. ‚ÄúPassword?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI brought pizza.‚Äù  
  
¬† The smell emanating from the box was heavenly. Her stomach growled. ‚ÄúOh, all right,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúPermission granted.‚Äù  
  
¬† Rituals were funny things.  
  
¬† People thought of them as either elaborate formulas, magic spells, or compulsions drilled into the subconscious by months or years of repetition.  
  
¬† But really, ritual was just a fancy word for habit. A thing that became easier to do than not do. And habits were simple‚Äîespecially bad ones, like letting people in.  
  
¬† Kate curled up on one side of the couch, Riley on the other, while some late-night talk show host murmured bad jokes on the TV.  
  
¬† He held up one of the cans he‚Äôd dropped. ‚ÄúThis‚Äôll be fun,‚Äù he said, cracking the tab. He cringed in expectation, then sighed with relief when it didn‚Äôt explode.  
  
¬† Kate grabbed a second slice of pizza, trying to hide the pain as the bandages tugged on the skin beneath her sleeve.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt have to do this,‚Äù she said between bites.  
  
¬† He shrugged. ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù  
  
¬† She considered him over the crust of her pizza. Riley was slim, with warm brown eyes, the kind of smile that took over his face, and a savior complex. When he wasn‚Äôt at the university or the police station, he volunteered with at-risk teens.  
  
¬† Was that what she was to him? His latest project?  
  
¬† Kate had been in Prosperity for all of three weeks when their paths crossed. She‚Äôd spent her nights squatting in abandoned buildings, her days nursing cups of coffee in caf√© corners as she scoured the opendrive for clues.  
  
¬† It was only a matter of time before the caf√© kicked her out‚Äîshe hadn‚Äôt bought anything in hours. Still, she didn‚Äôt appreciate it when a guy sat down at her table on the pretense of studying, only to ask her if she needed help.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd had her first run-in with a monster the night before, and it hadn‚Äôt gone well. But considering that the extent of her experience‚Äîschoolroom self-defense aside‚Äîconsisted of executing a bound Malchai in her father‚Äôs basement and nearly getting disemboweled by a Corsai on the subway, she really shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised.  
  
¬† She‚Äôd gotten away with a split lip and a broken nose, but she knew she looked rough.  
  
¬† She told the guy she wasn‚Äôt interested in God, or whatever he was selling, but he didn‚Äôt leave. A few minutes later a fresh cup of coffee appeared in front of her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow did that happen?‚Äù he asked, nodding at her face.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHunting monsters,‚Äù she said, because sometimes the truth was strange enough to make people go away.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUh, okay . . . ,‚Äù he said, clearly skeptical. He got to his feet. ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt move. ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI have a hot shower, an extra bed. There might even be some food in the fridge.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know you.‚Äù  
  
¬† He held out his hand. ‚ÄúRiley Winters.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate stared at his open palm. She wasn‚Äôt big on charity, but she was tired and hungry and felt like shit. Besides, if he tried anything unwanted, she was pretty sure she could take him. ‚ÄúKate,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúKate Gallagher.‚Äù  
  
¬† Riley didn‚Äôt try anything‚Äîthanks to the aforementioned boyfriend‚Äîjust gave her a towel and a pillow and, a week later, a key. To this day, she wasn‚Äôt exactly sure what had happened. Maybe she‚Äôd had a concussion. Maybe he was just persuasive.  
  
¬† Kate yawned, tossing the paper plate onto the table beside her gun.  
  
¬† Riley reached for the remote, switching the TV off.  
  
¬† Kate responded by switching the radio on.  
  
¬† Riley shook his head. ‚ÄúWhat did silence ever do to you?‚Äù  
  
¬† He didn‚Äôt know, of course, about the car wreck that had killed her mother and stripped the hearing from her left ear. Didn‚Äôt know that when sound was taken from you, you had to find ways to take it back.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you want sound,‚Äù said Riley, ‚Äúwe could always talk.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate sighed. This was his game.  
  
¬† Ply her with food and sugar until she was blissed out on empty calories, and then, invariably, start prying. And the worst part was some masochistic part of her must want it, must relish the fact someone cared enough to ask, because she kept letting him in. Kept ending up here on the couch with empty soda cans and pizza boxes.  
  
¬† Bad habit.  
  
¬† Ritual.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said, and Riley brightened visibly, but if he thought she was going to talk about herself, he was wrong. ‚ÄúWhy did you bring up that explosion?‚Äù  
  
¬† Confusion streaked his face. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOn the chat, you mentioned an explosion. Man-made. Why?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou saw that?‚Äù He sat back. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. The Wardens have got me looking for things that don‚Äôt line up,  
and it caught my eye. . . . It‚Äôs the fifth murder-suicide this week. That‚Äôs really high, even for Prosperity.‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate frowned. ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs some kind of monster?‚Äù  
  
¬† Riley shrugged. ‚ÄúSix months ago, I didn‚Äôt believe in monsters. Now I see them everywhere.‚Äù He shook his head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably nothing. Let‚Äôs talk about something else. How are you holding up?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúOh, look at the time,‚Äù she said dryly. ‚ÄúMalcolm‚Äôs going to get jealous.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThanks for your concern,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut I assure you, our relationship is stable enough to allow for time with friends.‚Äù  
  
¬† Friends.  
  
¬† The word glanced off her ribs, hard enough to leave her winded.  
  
¬† Because she knew a secret: there were two kinds of monsters, the kind that hunted the streets and the kind that lived in your head. She could fight the first, but the second was more dangerous. It was always, always, always a step ahead.  
  
¬† It didn‚Äôt have teeth or claws, didn‚Äôt feed on flesh or blood or hearts.  
  
¬† It simply reminded you of what happened when you let people in.  
  
¬† Behind her eyes, August Flynn stopped fighting, because of her. He collapsed into darkness, because of her. He sacrificed a part of himself‚Äîhis humanity, his light, his soul‚Äîbecause of her.  
  
¬† She could handle her own blood.  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt need anyone else‚Äôs on her hands.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúRule one,‚Äù she said, forcing her voice even, light. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make friends. It never ends well.‚Äù  
  
¬† Riley rolled a soda can between his palms. ‚ÄúBut doesn‚Äôt it get lonely?‚Äù  
  
¬† Kate smiled. It was so easy when you could lie.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Violence¬† has a taste¬† a smell¬† but most of all¬† it has¬† a heat‚Äî¬† the shadow  
  
¬† stands¬† in the street engulfed¬† in smoke¬† in fire in wrath¬† in rage¬† basking¬† in the warmth¬† and for an instant light glances¬† off a face¬† finding‚Äî

1mg9app,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mg9app/made_out_with_my_best_friend_while_she_had_a/,Made out with my best friend while she had a boyfriend (who's also one of my close friends) and we stopped talking to each other,"My apologies if I go all over the place, its my first time making this long of a reddit post. (burner account for obvious reasons) Yes, I know I'm a horrible person for doing what I did, but I am genuinely lost on what to do next in this chapter of my life. 

I (23M) have been good friends with a girl who we'll call Andrea (23F) since we were 5 years old. Throughout the years we have of course had our ups and downs in our friendship. We are both different people and would conflict on a good amount of things. But despite our lows, we loved spending time with each other, literally doing absolutely anything. When we were kids, we did kiss here and there in secret, but I blamed it on being a kid so I didn't think it was too deep. Throughout our teenage years and adult years, there were a few periods of time where we wouldn't hang out as much because we were both occupied with our own lives to put it short, but we would still text and call pretty often. When we were 14, she told me that she started seeing this guy named (we'll call him) Daniel (25M). With us being young and being close with each other's families, she would tell her parents that she was going to hang out with me in order to see Daniel. I was cool with doing her that favor because I know how parents feel about their young daughters starting to date. And of course, with me being around the both of them pretty often, I became close friends with Daniel as well.

Both Andrea and Daniel were always around each other throughout these years, me and them became our own little friend group and we called ourselves the Trio. Of course, with us spending a lot of time together going on trips and experiencing new things together, we all became very very close, even though we all still had our differences of course, as normal people do. She even tried to set me up with two or three different girls who didn't end up working out for me.

These two have been together since she was 14 and he was 16, and long story short, Andrea ended up cheating on Daniel twice, once when she was 17, and another when she was 20. I of course supported Daniel throughout these times and told him not to get back together with her. Him however, is a man that is simply too nice and WAY too forgiving. If you were to meet him, you would think he was the kindest and most caring man you ever met in your life. They both came to me for advice during these times, as I was the only close and trusted friend that they both had. With that being said, they rekindled their relationship twice because he forgave her in a sense and did not want to let her go in the end. I thought his decision wasn't fair to himself and I told them both that I didn't want to be involved in their personal relationship issues anymore, mainly because I didn't longer want to be involved in dealing with such a chaotic relationship that wasn't even my own.

They continued seeing other, whether it was an official relationship or not, and we kept on hanging out and being there for other as we got further into our twenties. I was an introvert in my teenage years who doubted himself very heavily, and these two honestly taught me how to be more outgoing and played a good part in molding me into the confident man I am today. They took me to my first ever club and etc. Last year however, things began to change.

Throughout all these years, she would constantly drop hints towards me, calling me attractive, dropping compliments to me, telling me she wishes we weren't extremely close to the point that we were almost like cousins or siblings or something, and touching me in certain ways whenever we were together. I obviously knew what she was doing, and while I was somewhat attracted to all of it, I always acted stupid and ignored the subject whenever it came up, due to the fact that I was nervous to go that far with her specifically and because she had a boyfriend that I was close with as well. And last year, she told me she wanted to start coming to the gym with me because she felt I took my workouts more seriously than her boyfriend did.

I didn't see it as anything bad and so, I took her to the gym with me for about 6-7 months. I work until 4pm, so I would always go to the gym at or after 7pm so I could have time to rest at home beforehand. during these gym days, we would leave the gym at a timeframe of 9pm to 11pm, and we would almost always want to get a post workout meal after or just go hangout somewhere. And during these times, i could tell that we were getting closer, and I was starting to find her more attractive than ever.

One night in April, she hungout with two new friends that she met and on her way home called me at around 11pm to hangout. I told her yeah, why not. I get in her car and we decide to go to a nice beach view we've been to before that's about 40 minutes away from home. We get there and it's just us two all alone. The tension was extremely high since the moment she picked me up and I was obviously holding myself back from doing anything with her for reasons previously mentioned. She ended up getting a small bruise from falling on some rocks and so we went home.

The next night, we're having another random convo on text and she randomly says ""I really need to make with someone"". I was a little high, so I respond with ""Don't we all. Don't wanna be weird but I'd help you out if I could"". She responded with ""You can"". The convo went on with both of us acting surprised at what we just said, and tells me I should have tried last night. We end up facetiming and she tells me that during the night at the beach view, she was also holding back the temptation to kiss me because she didn't know how I would react. We ended up talking in more of a sexual way and decided to meet up the following day.

We hungout the following night, went to target, and got some coffee pretending like nothing ever happened. on the way back to the parking lot where I left my car, she asks about what we were talking about last night. We talk about and she tells me that she wants to do it but she's a little bit hesitant, and not once did either of us mention Daniel's name. She parks in a dark spot of the parking lot, and after some more talking we ended up leaning in and made out for an hour. We got really into it and started touching each other and all that while we were doing it.

Two days later, we hungout with Daniel and some other friends, and after dropping off Daniel, we parked up somewhere, hopped in my backseat, and did more than we did the first time. This relationship continued for about 2 months, where would just do things together from time to time. She would facetime me every night, during my lunch break at work, and we would just talk a lot throughout every single day. We took a trip with some friends and she teased me heavily throughout it, tried to kiss me but pulled back as our lips touched, all while Daniel was a door away in the shower. Same exact thing happened a week later on my birthday trip. That was the last time anything sexual happened between us.

Her and Daniel eventually hit another rough patch in their relationship, leading to them breaking up. She was sad and crying a lot about it, and I was there to comfort her. She said that along with everything, she was also feeling guilty about what she did with me, and how Daniel was completely clueless about it. I also promised her from the beginning of everything that I wasn't gonna let what we were doing ruin our relationship. We kept hanging out after their breakup, and she was starting to get closer with the girls at her new job.

Then about a week ago, we hung out and everything was going fine until we parked up to eat pizza and I nicely asked her why she was being so mean to me recently. She apologized for it and we ended up talking about everything that's been happening the last couple of months. How she feels guilty about how she did all that with me and how Daniel doesn't know a thing about it, and that while she still wants to get back together with him, she still has heavy feelings for me in both a loving and a sexual way, which also led her to cutting off her relationship with Daniel. She partly blamed me for the breakup but I also took accountability in knowing that the both of them were still seeing each other, but that I still went ahead and did all of that. After more talking, she told me she wanted to stop talking for some time, which I obviously did not want to happen because I still care about her heavily as a friend. But we both came to that conclusion and I respected her decision. She ended up doing the same With Daniel the night before.

Two days pass and now I'm hanging out with Daniel and going to the gym with him due to him being sad about the new no contact thing. She then calls me and updates me on how she's feeling, and it ends on a good note. 3 more days pass and she asks if she could pick me up and I say yes. While I was expecting to talk everything out, she kept on telling me that she didn't want to talk. I realized only after that she was most likely trying to do things with me again. With me trying to fix things and her not wanting to talk, we argued about each other's feelings and how we're both handling the situation, and we both ended up going home mad.

Me being mad, I decide to tell Daniel half the truth in saying that she admitted that she likes me in that way and that I don't think he should get back with her. He then tells me that a week after our trip with friends (before my birthday trip) she told HIM that she thinks that I like her and that I was the one that tried to kiss her, which he was afraid to confront me about because he genuinely thinks I would never do anything like that :( Of course, I told him that the truth was that it was the other way around.

It's been a week since that last heated convo with her, and Daniel hasn't been seeing her either. 2 days ago, I broke no contact to wish her a happy birthday and she replies with a thank you. This whole week has obviously been taking a toll on Daniel, but it's also taking a toll on me. She was my best friend, despite all of our differences, she would want to go to places and do things that my main friend group would never want to go to with me. We have a lot of memories together and I really miss the genuine friendship we used to have. I regret ever doing anything sexual with her, because I would still have her by my side if I just simply thought with my head instead of my dick. She has a reputation of always coming back during times of conflict but a part of me is afraid that she won't. I genuinely don't want to lose her, and I want to respect the no contact, but I just want to go back to being the great friends that we once were and put all of this behind us.

What should I do? What CAN I do? How can I go about all of this and not lose her in the process? Please give me all the thoughts you have in the comments, I'll answer any questions as well. This is a hard topic to talk about to many people in my real life, and I just want as much advice as I can get, please.

Of course, this story goes much deeper than all of this, but I could genuinely write a whole book about it, so I of course can't put every single detail into this post.

Hey, AiContentAutomators fam! üôå 

Alright, let‚Äôs get real for a second‚Äîare you feeling stuck in a job that‚Äôs draining more than just your bank account? Maybe you‚Äôre staring at your laptop, thinking, ‚ÄúIs this it? Are my best years getting tucked away in a cubicle?‚Äù üò© We've ALL been there. 

But here‚Äôs the juicy part‚Ä¶what if I told you that you could *actually* turn things around by diving into the world of AI? 

Yes, you heard that right! **Upskilling in AI could be your ticket to a more fulfilling career (and a fatter paycheck).** Here‚Äôs why you should consider making the leap:

- **The Future is Now**: AI isn‚Äôt just some sci-fi dream anymore. It‚Äôs here and shaping industries. You want to catch that wave, right? üåä 

- **Skyrocket Your Earning Potential**: Let‚Äôs face it, the average salary for jobs in AI is nothing to sneeze at. Think of it as your golden ticket. *Cha-ching!* üí∏

- **Flexibility & Freedom**: Many AI roles offer remote work options‚Äîhello, work from anywhere! Your bedroom could transform into your office, a cozy coffee shop, or even a beach!

- **Impactful Work**: You could be part of projects that literally change the world‚Äîhow cool is that? If you crave purpose in your work, this is the way to go.

- **Endless Learning**: AI is evolving faster than I can nail down the perfect Netflix binge‚Äîthere‚Äôs always something new to dive into. If learning is your jam, you‚Äôll love it! üéì 

Now, I know what you‚Äôre thinking: *But where do I even start?* Look, it doesn‚Äôt have to feel overwhelming or like you‚Äôre diving into the deep end without a lifesaver. I stumbled upon this awesome educational program that‚Äôs seriously worth checking out: [Imagine AI Education!](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals) üöÄ

It's laid out in a way that's easy to understand, and they‚Äôre all about hands-on learning. It might be the boost you need to crank up your skills and end the job stagnation.

So, what‚Äôs stopping you? 

Sure, there may be doubts creeping in‚Äî‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm not good enough?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs too late for me?‚Äù Trust me, everyone starts somewhere! **Your potential is just waiting to be unlocked.** üí°

Hey, fellow AiContentAutomators! Can we just take a moment to appreciate the sheer genius of going faceless in the content creation game? üôå Seriously, who needs a face when you have ideas that can shine through without being front and center? It's like being the wizard behind the curtain; all the magic happens, but nobody needs to see your face to know it's there!

So, what‚Äôs the big strategy this week? Buckle up because I‚Äôm about to drop some golden nuggets on how to maximize your growth without showing your mug. 

Here‚Äôs how you can dive into the faceless content world:

1. **Choose Your Niche Wisely**: 
   - Find a niche that lets your personality shine without requiring a personal brand. Think blogs about tech, finance, or even niche hobbies! 
   - Let‚Äôs be real, who would rather watch a faceless deep dive into cryptocurrency than *me* showing off my coffee mug collection? ‚òïÔ∏è

2. **Focus on High-Quality Graphics & Voiceovers**:
   - Invest in tools like Canva or Adobe Creative Suite. Make your visuals pop! üé®
   - Use services like vocal AI to give your content a professional touch without needing to step in front of a camera. 

3. **Leverage Automation Tools**:
   - Seriously, if you‚Äôre not using AI tools for content creation yet, you're missing out! 
   - Check out this helpful guide [here](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals) for amazing resources that will save you time and boost your output. Time is money, my friends!

4. **Engage with Your Audience**:
   - Just because you‚Äôre faceless doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be emotionless. Respond to comments, create polls, or drop behind-the-scenes stories (yeah, chances are people will still love it!). You can connect deeply without showing your face!
   - Plus, who doesn't love a little mystery? ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs behind this awesome content?‚Äù Keep them guessing!

5. **Content Repurposing is a Game Changer**:
   - Take one piece of content and turn it into many. A blog post can become a podcast, a series of social media posts, or even a video (just don‚Äôt show your face!).
   - Remember, variety is key! Keep your audience on their toes. 

Now that we've laid down the basics, let‚Äôs talk about the elephant in the room: **Saturation**. üêò Isn‚Äôt it always on our minds? The truth is, faceless content is starting to explode. But that only means we need to get *creative* and *quick*. 

The beauty of being faceless is that it gives room for innovation. Don't be afraid to experiment! That's the real fun, right? üéâ

Anyway, what do you all think? Are you as excited about the faceless content revolution as I am? Let‚Äôs brainstorm some ideas together. What‚Äôs YOUR favorite way to create content without stepping into the spotlight?",1,1754191074.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1mg8vvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvLiterateRP/comments/1mg8vvg/f4m_a_rekindled_spark/,[F4M] A Rekindled Spark,"The Uber from the airport had been about a 40 minute drive and they were now pulling into familiar territory. The run down drug store at the corner. The Italian restaurant that has been run by the same family for who knows how long, yet was a staple in the community. It even looked the same, ten years later. Was that a good thing? The comfort that was often found in things that were familiar. Or, was it a bad omen that the things that drove her from town still existed and returning was a mistake.
Victoria‚Äôs phone vibrated in her pocket, though a glance at her watch told her that it was her mother. Of course it was.

The offer had been made to pick her up from the airport, but there was nothing appealing about being trapped in a moving vehicle with her mom for a 40 minute drive. A drive that led to a destination that wasn‚Äôt even the family home. That had been a stream of contentious texts and calls when she had stated she was renting an apartment instead of ‚Äúcoming home‚Äù. A confrontation only exacerbated by a ten year streak of virtual radio silence.
A streak Victoria was more than happy to continue if circumstances hadn‚Äôt forced her to return home. Or rather, really didn‚Äôt give her much of a choice. 

Her eyes squinted shut as echoes filled her mind. Noises crashing over her with the intention to drown. 

‚ÄúMiss, we‚Äôve arrived,‚Äù the driver called out, pulling her from the temporary nightmare. 
It was just going through the motions as she opened the door and slid out of the car. The driver handed her the suitcase that was in the trunk before she absently tipped the man on her phone. It was just so surreal to be back. Yet, as she looked up at the apartment, a feeling of dread set in. If she walked in now, she would have officially returned to the town she swore she never would. 

Slowly, Victoria‚Äôs gaze drifted towards the coffee shop a block down. That was, perhaps, the one thing she did miss. The Last Bean was the best shop for coffee and other cafe goods, and it was a hill she was willing to die on. If she went there, it would just be visiting. No committing to staying.

Resolved, she found herself walking down the block to the shop, a bell ringing as the door opened. The familiar scent of coffee was dominant in the air, but so was the general welcoming atmosphere. 

‚ÄúWelcome in!‚Äù A voice called, lost to the recess of her mind. She scanned the menu herself, yet, before she could order, there voice called out.

It was familiar, and yet, she couldn‚Äôt place it at the same time. Then again, more insistent, ‚ÄúTori?‚Äù The familiar voice called as she snapped her head towards the deep, resonant voice, ‚ÄúIs that you?‚Äù-
 
‚Äî‚Äî Hello there! If you‚Äôre read this far, I‚Äôm glad this has caught your interest! I‚Äôm a 26, female, looking for a long-term, literate, more realistic roleplay. I‚Äôd like a nice balance between plot and smut here. I‚Äôd love to hear your ideas for this story so we can create something that we both enjoy! However, I like the idea of giving up control when the woman is otherwise very independent in her own life. I‚Äôd also like to incorporate romance and digging into our characters. Especially as there was certainly reasons why my character left and is now back, and yours likely would have gone through changes in the past ten years. But I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts such as who your character is. Someone who had a crush on my character in high school? And old romance? Was your character the reason Tori left? Since I want to keep this collaborative in nature to build a premise, I left some of those reasons vague so we can fill them in. But I do have my own thoughts, at least as it pertains to my character. I hope to hear from you! Discord will be preferred to roleplay, but we can discuss here first before switching over.

üåÑ ""Whispers of Dawn at Necklace Road""

The stars had danced in silent grace,
Now yield to light, give morning space.
A hush still lingers on the street,
As shadows lift on walking feet.

The lake reflects a golden breath,
Of sun now waking from its rest.
Tree branches stretch like arms in prayer,
Embraced by dawn‚Äôs forgiving air.

One side, the cyclists hum their pace,
Wheels turning time with steady grace.
Joggers glide past in quiet rows,
While on our side, soft laughter flows.

No horns, no rush, no city cries,
Just glints of gold in sleepy skies.
The road, like ribbon gently laid,
Between our steps and calm cascade.

This is the hour of softest change,
Where dreams and daylight rearrange.
From dusky veil to amber hue,
A promise whispered: start anew.

So here we walk, not far, not fast,
Just catching morning as it passed‚Äî
And in this moment, still and wide,
We find the world walks by our side.

1mg8t8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mg8t8z/heres_jerry/,here's jerry,"i hit my balls on the corner of the street while i was driving my truck down the hill and when i turned around my mom was carjacking a jewish kid but he had a glock so we all started frolicking and then we fell through the earth, ended up with a lion and a tiger fist fighting for 50$ but that was all a mirage because we were actually in the desert dying from dehydration.

but all of a sudden everything disappeared, they all never existed, i'm actually an ant building an apartment complex with a coffee in my hand and a black 20 inch dragon dildo in the other, little did we know, our story was just beginning because after all of that happened, i jumped so high i hit the ISS off of it's course, killed the moon and inhaled the rings of saturn.

anyways, there was this mouse, let's call him larry, he was an engineer but also a man, sometimes he's a woman, anyways, when i woke up this morning, i was floating on a lava pool surrounded by myself and copies of my toes, but they were all burning and so was i, so i skipped the ad, went to sleep and now we're here, eating spaghetti at this fancy mongoose's house.

oh and also, in the beginning, it was the end. BUT, it was also the beginning.
anyways back to jerry, what's he doing, floating in the air going to mcdonalds but i don't exist. 
so after all is said and done, we went back to our place, turned on our individual intergalactic space compters‚Ñ¢ and both started researching the meanings and mechanics of pasta making.
while that was happening, a fancy mongoose opened an otherworldly portal right inside of my head so i did what any sane person would do, i went to the beach, but lo and behold it was actually a trap, it was all a lie, just like the cake.
so here we are now, minding our own business, eating our fancy caviar and counting down from 1000
1000, 999, 998, 997, 996, 995, 994, 993, 992, 991, 990 so on and so forth.
maybe it was all a dream and this whole time we were all just toys in a warehouse waiting to be shipped to our respective stores? who knows? not me.
or do i? maybe, anyways, back to jerry, what's he doing? i guess we'll never know, it is a secret of the universe after all.
so who are you? where are we? maybe i'm just a shadow and you're the light? so anyways, i started shooting, hit a few birds, went to wendy's, TELEPORTATION!







i'm behind you.

alright so, there's a cat, but also a ferret, anyways, i'm looking out the window and who do i see? 
jeffrey dahmer.
i bounce out of bed, make my bed, eat my breakfast, bed cereal‚Ñ¢, go to bed, think of beds.
so after the future went past us, i picked up a slab of dirt, smeared it on the wall to create a portal to p diddy's house, jumped in the air and winked at god, allah and zeus all at the same time.
so anyways jerry was there, but also, transparent so i did what he deserved, polished his head.
maybe it's just a crazy coincidence but i have the same birthday as barack obama.
anyways, let that sink in. 
i shit my pants but that's not the point cause after all, you did too but i scooped it by bluetooth before you could realize.
so tomorrow is yesterday but also wednesday february 16th 1881.
after midnight, you turned into a raccoon with a lust for blood but i'm gay and having sex with an intersex intergalactic intern alien who's also my third grade biology teacher and my long lost blood brother.
so anyways, i started twerking from my fingers after you realized we're all just on a rock floating in space but guess what?
you're dead.



...so, wanna go out sometime? says the mongoose, what will you say?

""i think i'm not ready for a relationship""
how sad, that mongoose was really into you.

anyways back to jerry, what's he doing?
SCANDALOUS!
painting the walls with feces.
anyways i started mastering the art of decoding the universe, larry wanting a part of it so i slinged him across the football field where your mom was having a romantic dinner with you fourth grade teacher, mr smith.
anyways i'm tired, my water bed awaits my return, Zzz...
surprise! we are not done here, see that portal? that's me and you from the future but also, maybe the past, are you ready kids?

so do you think this is all gonna work out, life, death, universe, unemployment, yeast infections?
honestly i'm not convinced, let's asking mindy the godess of truth.
she's not available.
so in 1678, i was a kid, you were an adult, i was you, you were you mom, we both worked in the same factory making tiny little kitchen utensils for rats.
so anyways i spontaneously combusted so you all started using me as a stove to cook my own flesh on.

was this all real?

was it all a dream?

who are we?

your mom.

haha.

anyways in 2072, i'll be dead, heart attack. but, you're still thriving, eating dirt and saying hello to pretty ladies.
but never forget the mongoose, he really wanted your love and you broke his heart.

First time poster, hello, and sorry for the LONG post. DH and I both enjoy Charlotte's videos and are having some problems figuring out how to handle this issue. We figured maybe the Potato Nation could help! To sum up, my in laws, particularly my MIL, have a pattern of treating me/us disrespectfully, and I'm at the point where either DH needs to have a frank talk with them or I, for my own mental health, want to go low contact. They both have control issues and can be manipulative, and my DH is MILS baby, despite not being the youngest. I'll set up with a bit of a timeline; I‚Äôll be as concise as possible, but it‚Äôs a lot, so bear with me. We‚Äôll call MIL Jane and FIL Steve. DH will be John. They will be known as the Darling family. Just a disclaimer, I do love these people and they're not awful all the time. We have plenty of shallow but pleasant/normal interactions, and I don't believe they're behaving from a place of malice so much as self defense. 

When John and I started seeing each other, he was living with his parents. I didn‚Äôt see Jane for the first several months because any time I came over, she would hide in her craft room. Mind you, we were distance, so I‚Äôd spend entire weekends there without seeing her once. We managed to live in the same city for a bit, and his parents had moved 10 hours away. However, a year into our relationship, he moved in with his parents to attend the school where they were. While he was away, we decided to get married. Here's where the incidents really begin. I began wedding planning. For context, all of my family and most of my friends are either overseas or halfway across the country, and the venue we booked had multiple rooms for them to stay in. BUT. Steve casually told me one day they were going to book extra rooms and turn it into a family reunion/getaway for the Darlings, who ALL live locally. I was surprised, but politely shut it down, which didn't end up mattering because COVID hit again, and we had to change venues and plans. At the time, my Dad was going through some health problems, and we weren't willing to take the risk of him flying over. So John and I talked, and we decided we would elope quietly with just us, our witnesses, officiant, and photographer, and then have a ceremony later where we could celebrate with everyone. Jane and Steve LOST IT. First, they suggested having the wedding as we were planning it with just the Darlings, and have a zoom stream for my family. I wasn't into that, as I wanted to be able to share the day with my family as well, and they had already hosted a surprise wedding shower for me without including or even letting my family know it was happening. Which meant it was the Darlings and then me, and not even any of my friends who do live in the area. They came back with ‚ÄúWell, if it were at your parent‚Äôs place and it was your family there, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be willing to have the Darlings watch on Zoom.‚Äù I said that wasn‚Äôt true because I wouldn‚Äôt ask John to go through that. I reminded them this was because of my Dad‚Äôs health problems that we didn‚Äôt want him flying, not just on a whim. Then they suggested that we drive out to where my parents lived, halfway across the country. I said I was willing to do that, and then they backtracked and said John's siblings wouldn't be able to afford it. After several days of back and forth, I told them firmly but politely that we were sticking to our elopement plan. Jane spent the next 2 days crying, to the point that Steve took it upon himself to message me and tell me I really should consider letting them attend, even if it was just the two of them. This whole situation was already hard for me, because of COVID our wedding was already looking so different from anything I‚Äôd hoped, and I was already grieving a lot. I again politely but firmly told him plans were going ahead as we had already decided.

(To give more context, despite all their kids being adults, my in-laws are the type of people who think they still have the right to tell their kids how to live. All 4 of their kids don‚Äôt usually say no or set boundaries, so I think this came as a huge shock to them. I honestly doubt any of their kids or other in laws had ever said such a firm no. Jane‚Äôs mom is the exact same way, and so is her sister, so essentially, the Darling family exists to keep those 3 women happy, or no one is happy type thing.)

John supported me in this, but not willingly. I tried to make it clear to everyone that this wasn‚Äôt about excluding anyone, it was simply about trying to make the best choice for everyone with no ideal options. John was trying to convince me to let his parents be there, and it got to a point where we almost broke up. So John told me that he was choosing me over her, and we stayed together and eloped the way we had planned. All that to say, my relationship with my in-laws didn‚Äôt get off to a great start. Now, newer issues.

John‚Äôs parents, especially his mom, visit often, usually for 3 weeks at a time. They have said, and I quote ‚ÄúWhen we‚Äôre visiting, we‚Äôre selfish and do expect everyone to hang out with us all the time, or as often as they can.‚Äù And John, who is very much a people pleaser, and also loves his parents and wants to spend time with them, inevitably ends up spending way more time with them than we agree on beforehand. John is in the military. When he gets deployed, we take the week before and after to be with just us. His parents know this. However, they ‚Äòjust happen‚Äô to come visit before and after EVERY deployment. During one of his first ones, they came to visit, and it was their first time (and last) staying with us. They brought their untrained dog with them and would let her harass our dog and tried to scold our dog for defending herself. They also tried telling us not to swear or smoke. In our own home. So John sent them a polite text asking them to not try to give us rules in our own house, essentially. The things Steve texted back were absolutely disgusting. I have some anaphylactic allergies and at the time had dairy and gluten intolerances. Believe me, I KNOW it sucks. This is important because one of the things he texted John was that we were horrible hosts and they had to bend over backwards with providing special food every time we visit them. Which was also untrue because I always bought my own extras or groceries if I needed entirely different meals. He said things along the lines of ‚ÄòThis isn‚Äôt how we raised you‚Äô and other personal attacks aimed at John as well. Jane, of course, started to cry, again for several days, and John was SHOOK. He has struggled since then to stand up to them at all, although I will say he at least now will gently hint to them, which is huge progress. Anyways, because of that incident, they spent the last few nights at a friend‚Äôs place, but one day we came home from work, the night before John was supposed to leave, and they had just‚Ä¶dropped their dog off at our house. No warning, no asking. Their reasoning was that their friends didn‚Äôt have a fenced yard, and Jane was too afraid to walk the dog until she‚Äôd take a shit. The irony about this is that their friends live in the equivalent of a gated community with extremely minimal crime. The plan was for John and I to have one last breakfast together before I dropped him off, but I got to spend the morning cleaning their dog‚Äôs piss and shit off our basement floor, and cleaning up several household items the dog ate. (She was a puppy at the time, so no hard feelings to the dog. We would have had the house ready HAD WE KNOWN a puppy was going to be staying with us. Grrr.)

They no longer stay at our place, which is just fine with me, but still visit way too often (in my opinion). The last time John was deployed and coming back, his mom came for a solo trip to visit that just happened, of course, to coincide with his trip home. And we were going to be leaving on our honeymoon about 2 days after he got back. To have some time to ourselves and avoid a scene, we may have given her slightly false info and told her John would be back on the 21, when he wasn‚Äôt back until the 24^(th). Well, when she found out which day he was actually coming back, she delayed her return home by 3 days DESPITE him telling her gently via text he wants to spend that time with me. (She ignores hints or intentionally misinterprets them.)

I‚Äôm already at the end of my rope, but this last year, she‚Äôs also started digitally pretending I don‚Äôt exist. For e.g., she made a Family Day post, and I was the only in law not included in the post. I don‚Äôt care in the sense that I‚Äôm not super active on social media, so it‚Äôs not about being posted, it‚Äôs about being the only one left out. She‚Äôs come to visit me for coffee three times when she‚Äôs been in the area and John was deployed, and each time sent a picture of our cat (a handsome boi, to be sure) to the group chat or to John and said something to the effect of ‚ÄúIt was so good to see the kitty boy again!‚Äù He, of course, deserves the spotlight, however. She didn‚Äôt mention even seeing me.

For me, the final straws have been the following 2 issues:

Incident 1: Last New Year‚Äôs Eve, the Darlings and I, sans John, were all at his one sister‚Äôs house (I was waiting to pick John up from a party). I had my dog with me, and she does NOT like being petted on the head, or SIL‚Äôs kids, who are nice but have zero manners. So she was pretty socially tapped out, and John‚Äôs brother went to pet her on the head goodbye. She snapped at the air next to him, so I had her lay down on the floor in front of my chair and said to him ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt touch her right now, she‚Äôs pretty tapped out.‚Äù Steve, in front of EVERYONE, said ‚ÄúAwww, no, she‚Äôs fiiiiine,‚Äù leaned over, and started rubbing and shaking her head in his hands. I stood up and moved her to the other side of the chair, but I honestly couldn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd do that. John talked to him about it and let him know it really bothered me, mostly for my dog‚Äôs sake, but also because of the lack of respect in front of the whole family. I have yet to receive any form of apology or acknowledgement of the situation.

Incident 2: This last spring, John and I FINALLY were able to go on our Honeymoon. While we were there, Jane created a group chat for photos, updates, etc. Except‚Ä¶the members were her, Steve, and John, and it was called ‚ÄúJohn‚Äôs Adventures‚Äù. As if I don‚Äôt even exist. We were honeymooning in my home country so he could meet my extended family. When John showed me (he was wondering why I hadn‚Äôt seen a post she‚Äôd sent), it hurt so much, I broke down in tears and cried in the shower. (I am NOT a cryer.) John was clearly also hurt by it. He asked his one sister about it, and her response to him was that it‚Äôs normal for families and in laws not to do everything together, but it still hasn‚Äôt been sitting right with either of us.

Recently, his parents have been visiting again, looking at houses to move back. (Yes, I had a small meltdown when I heard that news.) While they were here, I chose not to go to any hangouts except two, because his sisters would be there too, so it would be more bearable, less tension. Jane noticed my absence and asked John ‚ÄúIs something wrong with OP? We‚Äôve barely seen her all week‚Äù. He told her that my feelings were hurt by the group chat. Her response to him was ‚ÄòOh, I forgot to add her to it‚Äô. Which would make sense, if she hadn‚Äôt named it JOHN‚ÄôS Adventures. She never mentioned it to me, apologized, or even acknowledged she did anything wrong. They also walked into our house unannounced multiple times, despite John texting something like ‚ÄòBy the way, send a text or call before you come over because I might be naked lol‚Äô.

I am at the point where I want to go no contact with them. I‚Äôm already feeling disrespected while they‚Äôre living far away, and I can‚Äôt imagine how much worse it‚Äôll be when they live here. Both his sisters mentioned when they DID live here, they expected the kids to something with them every weekend, and something tells me they‚Äôll have similar expectations now, especially because they‚Äôre both going to be retired. John doesn‚Äôt think he should say anything unless another incident pops up, and he‚Äôll address things as they happen. However, I think he needs to tell his parents, particularly Jane, right now, something like ‚ÄòThis is my wife, I love her, and you need to stop treating her with disrespect‚Äô. John thinks he‚Äôs doing enough, and he‚Äôs upset that I‚Äôm asking him to do more. I have had enough. Am I being unreasonable? I‚Äôve told John if he won‚Äôt have my back in a firm way, even if it pisses them off, that I‚Äôll be going no contact. He doesn‚Äôt want that either and thinks I should be the one to talk to her. But my thinking is, they both know they‚Äôve hurt me and still haven‚Äôt apologized or acknowledged it, so I don‚Äôt see the point. I want to have a good relationship with them, but I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible. They‚Äôre not evil or monsters or anything, but they‚Äôre just not people I want to have in my life. There have been other incidents as well, I‚Äôve just included the bigger ones for the sake of keeping this short. Potato People, HELP!

A few months back I was studying for my degree, pursuing career goals, running tons (which meant I get to enjoy tons of food) and enjoying my daily life. But now it feels like a constant fight with myself. Going for a run is a chore, going to work is a chore, getting up is a chore, reading is a chore, making food is a chore, etc etc. 

I have some ideas of what might be causing it: maybe it's spending more time on Instagram (my friend is currently in another country so can't use his number, and we're all living together next year so I've started doomscrolling more). Or maybe its because I don't have that same structure as I did before from university.

Another option is maybe my dating life. Around 5 weeks ago I decided to say fuck it and hop into the dating scene - which has gone great! I've been seeing this girl for around 3-4 weeks and really enjoy spending time with her. 

However, my emotions feel... weird. I'm not really sad anymore? But, not in a bad OR good way. I still laugh at memes and enjoy getting coffee and etc. I feel like I'm just not worried about anything, in a bad way. Like it feels like I just don't know what being sad feels like anymore, like in a sociopathic way. Its just kinda worrying.



To be honest, this little blog has left me with more questions than answers, in a good way. I'm just gonna start trying to get into more of a routine starting tonight/tmwr. ",2,1754189721.0,selfimprovement,2,1.0,False
1mg8j51,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mg8j51/my_fianc√©e_23f_and_i_27m_are_on_the_verge_of_a/,My fianc√©e (23F) and I (27M) are on the verge of a breakup after 5 years because theyve slowly lost the feelings/spark/romance for me in our relationship for reasons that dont make sense to me.,"For context that will be important later on, my fianc√©e was originally going to move in with their mother who lives very far away after they graduated high school, but they met me and plans changed. We met when they were 18 and I was 21(a month out from being 22)

Also my fianc√©e goes by they/them so naturally, theres a lot of ""they's"" and ""them's"" in this story instead of ""she's"" and ""hers""

Also sorry for this being very wordy, theres a lot of moving parts.



We've been together since covid started, so we've been through a good couple of ups and downs in the relationship. From having a friend group crash and burn in front of our very eyes very early on in our relationship, to getting engaged last year, we've been through some stuff and I'm happy to say that they are the love of my life. We moved in together just over 3 years ago in an apartment that literally fell in our lap. Cheap rent, from a landlord that is a very close family friend of mine, as well as my fianc√©e's parents moving 3 hours away right around the time we were considering the apartment, and i had just gotten a raise/promotion so it LITERALLY fell in our lap and was the perfect opportunity. We were super excited to have our future with one another.

However, over the past couple months, they have been bringing up issues they've had with me for the past few years that had caught me by surprise because I didnt think they would let things build up like they have. Granted, most of these issues that they have with me, I absolutely agree with them and have profusely held myself accountable for. But the accountibility didnt seem to be reciprocated nearly as much and I feel this is slowly forming into a ""this is all my fault"" sort of deal when there are things that I wish my fianc√©e did to not let things snowball so that they didnt alter their perception of me.

For example, early on i was really clingy in the relationship. This was the first time I was in a relationship for a while AND covid was happening so a lot of time was spent talking on the phone (like 16 hour phone calls sometimes). I had thought that the desire for them to talk with me so much was genuine because it hadnt been brought up as an issue until over 5 years later. Obviously there was some desire to talk with me for periods of time, but this was an issue for them that they had brought up to me recently and it makes sense that they would feel like i was being clingy. Back then, they wouldve wanted to spend more time by themself but felt like they couldn't because I wanted to talk on the phone so often. So, I get where they're coming from. Its something that hasnt been an issue for a while since we've lived together (obviously) but i understand that and take accountability for it.

Another example is that a lot of times, i get defensive over some simple questions they ask me that are not meant with any ill intent. I struggle with trust issues that I've had from my mother growing up that made me feel like i have to be defensive about things. I understand that those familial issues are not my fault, but they become my fault when i dont adress them over time, AND when it starts affecting other people. So i understand that issue. (Planning on getting a therapist soon when my open enrollment for health insurance kicks in for my job) 

Another issue they had with me before is a bit more of a gray area? Obviously there are things that i totally understand where they come from, but other things ive felt like i havent been appreciated for NEARLY as much as i should be.

Essentially, I make most of the money in the house and i pay for almost everything that's shared between us. Gas/electric, internet, most of the big grocery trips ( but they very often go for smallish trips for groceries as well), a majority of the rent, emergency expenses, phone bill (and I payed for their phone), and a couple more things. I also drive us everywhere whenever we go out to a function, so a lot of gas too, and going out to eat/ordering takeout etc.

They have had a job and a car ever since before moving in together, so we've mostly kept payments split based on how much income we make. In short, I pay for more things cause I make more money. I have no complaints about having to do that whatsoever.

They ALSO have chronic stomach issues so its hard for them a lot of the time to do things around the house or to even go out sometimes, even calling out of work sometimes because they have had such bad flare ups. I'll take them to appointments, the ER, and ill pick up their meds and whatnot because they can't themself sometimes. Its not debilitating stomach issues 100% of the time, but enough that they often get in the way of things.

Also, for additional context, I have recently gotten a new job after quitting the worst job of my entire life. In short, this job was utter hell. It turned me into someone that i did not like and that affected things at home for a little while. But i stuck the job out for as long as i could because i didnt have another job lined up AND i knew all the aformentioned responsibilities i had that i needed this job for. 

Now, the issue that they have brought up to me lately that I totally understand is that I didnt do a good job of noticing when they did things around the house. There would be times where i brought up feeling like I do a lot of the work around the house because on my days off of working this hellish job, i would clean the house and I would do a lot in 1 go. It was wrong of me to have this idea they dont do enough around the house because there were things i just didnt notice that they did, as well as things they couldn't do because of their stomach issues. That is something I hold myself accountable for, it was wrong of me to assume they hadnt done things because i didnt see them. The job I had really put me on edge every single day (I worked at staples in the print section as the supervisor in an insanely high volume store with customers threatening me on a very uncomfortable basis, in case anyone was wondering. But that is a whole other can of worms to open.) And it affected how i saw things at home. But again, i need to hold myself accountable for things.


The GRAY area for me was that i didnt know when i should've been stern about them doing some things around the house vs when i should have taken care of things myself. Again, they have chronic issues. HOWEVER, there would be plenty of times where they would go out into the kitchen just to grab a snack or make food when i felt as though they couldve thrown gross old food away on their way in there. It had gotten to a point where they would leave unfinished food and drinks out to rot and grow mold sitting on our coffee table, and we had also gotten gnats that we could not figure out the source of. And it even kept happening after i mentioned it to them as an issue i had. It took me to be the one to show initiative to fix the stuff that sat for sometimes weeks at a time, on top of a couple other things that piled up. 

I had told them that i understood not being able to function well because of their chronic stomach issues and Im here to support you. But at the VERY LEAST, can you please throw away your food so that it doesn't grow moldy and stink up the apartment and become a biohazard. Eventually things got better in that regard after discussing them and we carried on.

All that to pretty much say I do a lot for my fianc√©e. I know ive made some mistakes when it came to my job and how i handled myself because of it, but I work hard and im trying to be a good man. I do because i know their struggles and i have been supporting them when their rich family cant even spare some fucking money to pay for their schooling, so my fiancee had to take out a school loan to support taking more classes to graduate quicker because that's what they want to do. So, I started paying for things more often because I know they don't want to work and go to school at the same time (i didn't even do that when i went to school because i know it would've been hell for me too). Mind you, I'm making less than I was working for that shitty job, but I'm still making things work.


Lately, as ive mentioned, the issues that have been brought up seemed to have snowballed into the past few months feeling like pure emotional torture because now i doubt myself about a lot of things. I think this level of self reflection is good for me because there have been a lot of unchecked things that i didnt even know existed without my fianc√©e bringing them up to me. But the only problem i had with that is that i had to find out about a lot of those issues myself. 

I've been noticing the signs of them not feeling intimate or romantic or even cuddly a lot of the time. I tend to be someone who speaks directly when i feel someone bothers me. So, I usually expect people to tell me when something is bothering them OR i tend to pick up on when someone has an issue with me. I had noticed these changes in their behavior for a few MONTHS leading up to this, so i naturally brought things up to them. I started getting really insecure about things even to the point of thinking they mightve been cheating on me (not saying i should have thought that, i tend to overthink a lot. But i just didnt know what to think EVEN after talking to them about it). They told me that they had been in denial about the feelings of me changing, attributing the change of feelings to the new birth control that they started taking that was making them feel less romantic/less in the mood for ""certain activities"". But eventually they told me that the feelings they had been having were real and not from the change in medicine, they just didnt want to believe them.

Also, this all came out to me with the help of their therapist, so obviously there's some professional help involved so im taking the issues they're having with me seriously. 

But the main issue I had with these things are that things have balled up for the past few years and they're now coming to me about everything. Meanwhile, I was under the impression that they would tell me whenever something bothers them because of conversations we had about that topic. And usually, they did bring up the smaller things that bothered them so I had no reason to not trust that theyd bring up bigger issues that persisted.

The problem I had for a while was that when I bring things up that they have done to bother me, they have a hard time seeing where im coming from a lot of the time and it has tended to feel like they cant keep themselves accountable for things. They have a very very hard time saying the words ""I'm sorry"". Things have gotten better in that regard, but im just typing this for context about the issues we had.

There have been times where I've tried to comfort them about when they cant figure out something in a videogame but they made me feel as though I was annoying them, a lot of times a lack of appreciation for doing things, feeling awkward and left out/ignored/unheard during friend gatherings. All these things i feel have gotten better over time, but i feel like ive struggled trying to get them to acknowledge these things up until more recently when they brought up all these issues with me.

Mind you, again, most of this stuff was brought up apart of this big argument recently so its our biggest argument that we've had in our entire relationship.

Basically, all this to say that we both have issues when it comes to one another. But I feel that theyre not willing to put in the work to get back to where we were and now they want to move in with their mother partly because things have gone a bit sour here. They've wanted to live with their mother for a long time now and im willing to eventually sacrifice being close to my family down here to move with their family over there (since i have my own issues with my family, and theyve been living down here with my family for a while so its only fair to consider moving up there with their family).

But now my fianc√©e says that they have lost the spark/romance in our relationship and they dont think they love me anymore, but the reasoning just doesn't make sense to me. They said something along the lines of ""I don't know if continuing to try is going to bring that spark back"" but thats kinda what we signed up for when we decided we wanted to get married. Again, this is our first ever big argument we've had in our entire relationship so there's obviously going to be some doubts about things. But I went into the proposal/engagement FULLY KNOWING that we would be in situations like this, but I feel like im the only one who's willing to really work to get back to where we were. 

Mind you, they started having doubts about me like 5 or 6 months after we got engaged which really has me so confused and feeling like the desire to end things is a bit impulsive. I also sincerely do not think that they have been unfaithful to me in any way.

We were both outwardly very on board with this engagement/marriage, so much so that they (jokingly kinda) were upset that i didnt propose sooner. They also say that there isnt really a reason why they lost feelings, they just did over time. I also asked if they may be having commitment issues and they dont think thats the case either. They told me that they were willing to look past the issues we had with one another to continue this marriage, but the feelings they have for me have just simply changed and i just dont get it.

I understand shit happens and feelings change, but i can't help but feel like im just not appreciated? Maybe? Also, them not saying the words ""thank you"" to me has always been a point of contention between us when it comes to gift giving or doing things around the house (albiet this is also something that has improved a lot over time). Do we just need time to heal?? I want them to be happy and if thats not with me, then so be it. But I dont wana regret not giving us proper time to heal from this if thats just simply what we need. I feel we owe it to each other to give this time to heal because we've been through so much over the years AND WE PRACTICALLY JUST GOT ENGAGED. And im afraid that they may have a change of heart if they decide to move away. Ive been going through so much emotional turmoil idek at this point.

We're 2 different people who were brought up 2 different ways, and those ways clash sometimes but I love them because of the good they have in their heart and the things they do for me. It has just been feeling like they really dont appreciate all the work ive put in to make things work for us and now they've lost feelings for me because of a seemingly unidentifiable reason.


Sorry for the tldr being a whole paragraph, but there are a lot of moving parts to this situation that it was hard just making it a couple sencences.

If youve gotten this far, thank you for reading this. I have been emotionally drained for weeks/months and I just needed my thoughts to go out into the dark aether. I really appreciate you for reading this.

Advice or insight?


TL;DR 
Fianc√©e is slowly losing feelings for me. They let some issues snowball over the years because of their hesitancy to tell me about these issues in the past, and most of them have been aired out over the past few months with the help of their therapist. They want me to be held accountible for them. I understand exactly where they're coming from and Ive held myself accountible for them. Ive ALSO had issues with them that they eventually held themself accountible for, but now they feel they lost the spark/romance in the relationship. Mind you, this is the first big argument we've ever had so i want to put in the work to bring things back to where they were, but i dont think they feel the same way.",0,1754189719.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

1mg8eed,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mg8eed,"She Googled how to photograph a baby mid-session ‚Äì then snatched the photos from my hands and refused service (Fast East Goods & Printing, Winnipeg)","I had seen some warnings online about Fast East Goods & Printing Services (2116 Pembina Hwy, Winnipeg), but didn‚Äôt fully believe them‚Äîuntil I brought my two-month-old baby in for a passport photo. It turned into one of the worst service experiences I‚Äôve ever had. Here‚Äôs what happened:

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è Price changed without notice

She first quoted $25.99. After reconfirming, she added an extra $9.99‚Äîwithout explanation. I still booked the earliest slot at 11:00 AM, but she showed up over 10 minutes late. While I waited with my baby, she took walk-in customers ahead of me.

‚∏ª

üì∑ Totally unprofessional photo process

She grabbed a white hoodie from her couch, flipped it inside out, and used it as a background on her coffee table. My baby was placed directly on that.

The camera‚Äôs autofocus was so slow (5‚Äì10 seconds per shot) that she missed almost every good moment. After 20+ blurry shots, she actually asked ChatGPT: ‚ÄúHow to take photos of a baby?‚Äù

Then she Googled Canada‚Äôs passport photo rules‚Äîand realized too late that the baby‚Äôs ears had to be visible. So we had to start over.

‚∏ª

üñ•Ô∏è Poor editing and baby exposed to heat

She used Photoshop to erase hoodie wrinkles but the result looked messy and unprofessional.

Meanwhile, my baby started fussing from the heat, so my wife took him outside to cool off. In hindsight, this whole ordeal was not worth it.

‚∏ª

üí∏ Undisclosed extra charges

She said the total was $43.68. The receipt showed:
	‚Ä¢	$22.99 for ‚Äúpassport photo‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	$5 ‚Äútoddler charge‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	$9.99 for ‚ÄúChina travel document photo‚Äù

None of these fees were mentioned beforehand. When I asked why it was different from the original quote, she just said ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù When I asked for the $2 difference to be refunded, she said ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt. That‚Äôs how the system is.‚Äù No explanation. No apology.

‚∏ª

üö® Then things got ugly

As I turned to leave (not wanting to argue with a baby waiting in a hot car), she suddenly grabbed the printed photos and receipt out of my hands and said she was refunding me because she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt like working with petty customers.‚Äù

She added: ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt get the photos anymore.‚Äù

I still haven‚Äôt seen any refund as of writing this.

‚∏ª

ü§Ø She then lectured me

She claimed I was ‚Äúungrateful,‚Äù that I got a ‚Äúdiscount‚Äù (despite being overcharged), and that I didn‚Äôt tip. She even blamed my baby, saying he cried the whole time‚Äîwhich was just false. He had been calm and even smiling during most of the shoot.

I pointed out that the delays were due to her lack of skill. She got furious again and told us to go elsewhere.

Despite all this, my wife and I remained calm. We even said we‚Äôd pay again‚Äîjust to get the photos and avoid redoing everything. She refused.

In the end, I asked her to destroy the photos and left.

We went to another professional studio right after, and the difference was night and day.

‚∏ª

‚ùóFinal thoughts

This was frustrating beyond belief. Unprofessional setup, hidden charges, and openly hostile behavior‚Äîespecially unacceptable when working with babies.

If you‚Äôre in Winnipeg and need baby passport photos, I strongly recommend avoiding this place.

We worked together back then, but we went to different schools. I had a crush on her, asked her out once, and she gently turned me down. It stung a little, but I was glad I asked, and ever came of it. We stayed connected on social media throughout college and into adulthood however we never really stayed in close contact.

I‚Äôve done okay in life. I‚Äôm not rich, but I inherited my grandparents‚Äô house in town, which allows me to live a much more comfortable life than I could otherwise afford at this stage. My career is going well. I work to live rather than aiming to be a CEO or anything like that.

At a recent friend‚Äôs birthday party, I ran into Sarah. We caught up and talked about the old job. She still looked amazing, although it seemed like she was a bit stuck in the past. That said, we had a great conversation and exchanged numbers.

Sarah asked me out for coffee, and we ended up going on a date. The chemistry felt real. We went on a second date which led to a third. During that third date, she told me she has a daughter. I was surprised. I don‚Äôt spend much time on social media, so I hadn‚Äôt seen anything that indicated she had a child, but to be fair she also didn‚Äôt use any platforms much. 

I played it cool and we had a good night, but in the back of my mind I knew it wouldn‚Äôt work out. This isn‚Äôt about some purity standard or moral judgment. I just know myself‚Ä¶ I want to be someone‚Äôs main person, and in a relationship where there‚Äôs a child involved, I would never be that. Her daughter would always, and rightfully, come first. If I decide to have kids someday, I would want them to be biologically mine. That‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always felt strongly about.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve have a great time catching up and connecting however I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm not interested in being a parent or parental figure. It would be unfair of me to get involved with you any further, as being a parent is an important part of who you are, and your child is an important part of your life in general.‚Äù

She was very upset and asked why I was judging her. I explained that I just wanted to be someone‚Äôs first priority and that nothing was wrong with her or her daughter. I told her I was not the one for her, and I meant it respectfully.

Now she has started telling others that I won‚Äôt date her because she‚Äôs a single mom. That‚Äôs true. The problem is, she is also saying it might be because her child is biracial. Sarah is white. I‚Äôm white. From what I understand, her daughter‚Äôs father is Black. She never accused me directly, but I‚Äôve now had two people tell me she strongly implied that race was the real issue.

That is absolutely not the case. Her child‚Äôs race never even crossed my mind when she told me she had a daughter. I‚Äôve dated outside my race before. I don‚Äôt have any issue with mixed families. The issue for me was simply that she had a child, and I know I‚Äôm not ready to be involved in that dynamic.

Now a few people in our circle are treating me differently. Conversations feel colder. Some friends seem distant. It‚Äôs clear something has shifted.

AITA for how I handled it? I tried to be honest and respectful, but now I feel like I‚Äôm being accused of something I would never do. Could I have done something differently?",256,1754188784.0,AITAH,145,0.9,False

**Content warning for cancer**

\[Date and time: September 15^(th) of the 172^(nd) year after the collapse | 10:21 PM

Location: Bowman‚Äôs bedroom, Downtown Toronto

**Bowman**

To put it bluntly, Anthony Bowman was a weird man. The clothes he wore made people who saw him for the first time do double takes as they walked by. His speech pattern was a mix of professor-like pedantic monologues and torrents of decidedly unprofessorlike profanities, which went together like peanut butter and hot sauce.

¬†

He was well aware of these facts, but just couldn‚Äôt bring himself to give a fuck about them. He‚Äôd lived too long and seen too much to care what some pencil pusher at the university had to say about his choice of wardrobe or words. But someone, one of his own students no less, had managed to figure out his identity. Maybe he should start paying attention to the people around him.

¬†

Bowman still didn‚Äôt know what gave him away. He thought he‚Äôd been careful not to leave a trail, but in hindsight, he noticed he‚Äôd started to slowly become complacent as the decades passed. The thought of Bowman being a 210 year old former member of task force Remnant should be too ridiculous for anyone to contemplate seriously. But not only had the kid managed to somehow put two and two together, he had enough balls to confront him about it to his face.

¬†

Bowman had spent the last week or so trying to process the fact that there was someone out there who knew his real identity. *How long has it been?* The thought felt strange, but oddly freeing. He was always surrounded by people, but he could never truly connect with any of them. How could he, when none of them knew who he truly was, and what great secrets he was keeping from the rest of humanity.

¬†

He walked to his desk and opened a drawer, picking up the old journal inside. Its seam was coming apart from being opened too many times, and the coffee coloured papers inside it were probably one stiff breeze away from disintegrating into nothing. Still, even after all this time, he couldn‚Äôt let go of it.

¬†

With the spread of neural cybernetics, it had become possible to replay a memory, provided you saved it as a file in your implants. It was deeper than merely remembering it normally. During the replay, your mental reference point for ‚Äòhere and now‚Äô shifted to the time and place the memory took place, making it feel like you were living it again. This possibility had created a new form of addiction in the modern world, an addiction to the past. One that Bowman very much suffered from.

¬†

He knew it was a problem, but he didn‚Äôt care. The present had stopped being interesting a long time ago. All he knew was the before times, the times written about in the journal. He kept going over it, envisioning doing things differently this time, making different choices, saving the world. But the past could not be changed, no matter how desperately you wanted to.

¬†

This time though, he was going back to his past for a different reason than he usually did. He might have found a reason to live again. He wanted to feel young, to feel the same burning passion to change the world he did before it went to shit, before he became a husk of a human being.

¬†

He held the journal in his arms, lying back onto his bed. The memories that the journal held were from before his modifications, so he didn‚Äôt remember them as perfectly as he did everything these days. He had to put them together, a compilation of memories with various qualities.

¬†

He mentally searched for the file, found it, and set it to play.

¬†

\-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† \[**System message:** memory file Remnant selected. Commencing replay\]

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He‚Äôd been busy cooking breakfast for himself when he heard a knock on the door. When he opened, he was greeted by a wall of department of homeland security agents. They told him that his talents were requested by the UN, and he was being drafted to investigate the anomaly. After he gathered his belongings, they put him in a black van, and drove him to a classified lab somewhere deep in the Mojave Desert.

¬†

The van had no windows, and the agents escorting him didn‚Äôt exactly make for riveting conversation partners, which left Bowman to stew in his own thoughts. Sensing that he was approaching a major turning point in his life, he opened his backpack and took out his leatherbound journal. Physical journals were considered archaic these days, and very few used them, but Bowman found the sensation of a pencil on paper to be calming. He found the first empty page and began to write.

¬†

*Day 1, UN mission start.*

¬†

The ‚Äúlab‚Äù turned out to be an underground warehouse. Rows and rows of equipment and machines, basically anything that could be found in a laboratory or workshop, were laid out across the massive space. Mounds of spectronics from across the country were arranged in cabinets near the entrance gate. Each spectronic had an attached tag with basic information, such as location of discovery and the name of the person trapped inside it.

¬†

There, he met his teammates for the first time, scientists, engineers and technicians from every major discipline, brought in from all over the world. One of the agents that had brought him there handed him a paper and told him to read it over twice, and sign if he agreed. Bowman felt a cold chill as he read over the NDA. The smallest unauthorized disclosure of information could have him on the wrong end of a firing range.

¬†

After the formalities were taken care of, they were taken to the central area of the warehouse, where the lab equipment gave way to a small podium stationed in front of several rows of foldable steel chairs. They were provided with hazmat suits with built in faraday cages, and told they were ‚Äútask force Remnant‚Äù now. Their job? Very simple, find out what the hell is going on.

¬†

Simple doesn‚Äôt mean easy. As soon as the agent finished her orientation speech, everyone instantly got to work, making the warehouse feel like a busy airport. It was one of the technicians that made the first, and possibly most important breakthrough. He proposed that since only a small subset of electronics form spectronics, they should look for a shared attribute within the spectronics that normal electronics didn‚Äôt have.

¬†

While inspecting the inner components of the spectronics, a detail immediately popped out to the team. The gold used in their circuit boards had a very slight tint of blue that wasn‚Äôt present in regular gold. They managed to narrow down the source of the strange metal to a moderately sized Chinese precious metal mining company.

The work sped up significantly after the discovery of Fujian gold. The team finally had solid leads to chase, and new discoveries started to roll in at a breakneck pace.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Day 262, Mission end.*

¬†

They finally had enough to write their first report on the anomaly. The day they submitted it to the government, Bowman felt a warm sense of accomplishment in his chest, despite the bone deep exhaustion.

¬†

*Something‚Äôs wrong*, said something deep in his mind. He ignored it.

¬†

Bowman was told that his work here was done for now. He was put in a similar black van to the one that brought him here and arrived at his home back in LA a few hours later.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
The next nine months went by in an uncomfortable blur. The days seemed to merge, and Bowman could hardly tell when one ended and the next began. He just went through the motions, unable to shake the uneasy feeling that had been slowly growing inside him, like waiting for the other shoe to drop.

¬†

The news was a confusing mess of misinformation and speculation, with a conspicuous absence of anything resembling solid evidence. Bowman suspected that their work was being deliberately kept back from the public. That information would drop like a bomb no matter which way the UN security council tried to cut it, but the delay would buy them time to scope out all the ramifications.

¬†

*Something‚Äôs wrong!* His subconscious insisted. He ignored it.

¬†

Bowman was a man of science. He didn‚Äôt keep up with politics, and he considered all the cloak and dagger bullshit to be below his attention. His ultimate mission in life was to extract *truth* from the chaos of the natural world and gift it to his species. Which was the reason he hadn‚Äôt refused when the DHS showed up on his doorstep once again and asked him to get back to work, this time directly for the US government instead of the UN.

¬†

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Day 492, US mission start.*

¬†

Another black van, another NDA, the same warehouse. The foldable chairs were still there, as if nobody had bothered picking them up after the task force finished its mission. Unlike last time however, there were noticeably more chairs than people now. The international members of Remnant weren‚Äôt there, and many of the American members had seen the writing on the wall and decided to make themselves and their families scarce before homeland security could ‚Äòpersuade‚Äô them to stay. The reduced numbers made the colossal warehouse feel even more cavernous than he remembered.

¬†

Just like he‚Äôd suspected, the government had been busy. The department of homeland security had taken one look at the research done by the taskforce and had shit its collective pants. The gold had the power to bypass someone‚Äôs physical body and interact with their consciousness directly.

¬†

When a new potential avenue of science or technology presents itself to humanity, being late to the party could be catastrophic. A fact appreciated, usually briefly, by the many men in history who tried to fight firearms with swords. Because of this, the US was locked in an unspoken but very real competition with other countries to be the first to explore the possibilities that the discover Fujian gold opened.

¬†

The word ‚Äòsoul‚Äô had been thrown around many times by members of the task force when examining the gold and its effects on people. How else could you describe people‚Äôs minds being torn from their biology after death and trapped within inanimate objects. People already suspected that what the spectronics interfered with was the soul, but there‚Äôs a difference between speculation on social media and official confirmation by a team of renowned scientists.

¬†

Task force Remnant had been mostly comprised of regular civilians, chosen because of their abilities. Not exactly the sort of people you would want to be in on top secret information. But the pressure the public was putting on the government was increasing by the day, and their research being exposed was only a matter of time. The governments of the world had only a short timetable to work with before shit started really hitting the fan.

¬†

Their briefing was short and to the point this time. The CIA had reported that China had begun work on several new projects, one of them being a device that could capture a person‚Äôs soul in its entirety after death, unlike the messy tearing that was the norm for spectronics. This would open a world of possibilities for them, the most concerning being the ability to capture and torture people for information essentially forever. Their task was to create the device even faster than China could, and to develop countermeasures for the Chinese technology.

¬†

It felt like being in a second cold war, a mad dash not to reach a destination, but just to not fall behind the others. That didn‚Äôt sit well with Bowman, he believed that the things they discovered belonged to all of humanity. They could finally answer many of the questions that people have been asking themselves since before recorded history. But it seemed that at this point, his opinion didn‚Äôt matter much.

¬†

Men in balaclava masks and carrying visible firearms were loitering around the warehouse as they worked. They didn‚Äôt say much, and didn‚Äôt threaten anyone, but the implication could not be missed: *Work, or we will make you work.*

¬†

And so, they did. They worked day and night, with no end in sight.

¬†

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Day 637. What the fuck?*

¬†

Morale took even more of a hit when the government started to bring in so called ‚Äútest subjects‚Äù for the team to experiment on by the truckload. They‚Äôd known that most of the task force would refuse to indulge in wanton human experimentation, so they had decided to do it themselves. It turned out that in the nine months between the end of Remnants‚Äô UN assigned mission and the start of the current one, the government had been using their research, and the incomplete designs they managed to steal from the Chinese, to run their own less than savory projects.

¬†

¬†

Prisoners had been going missing from all over the country, and as Bowman watched one of the agents unceremoniously dump an unconscious man wearing an orange jump suit on the dusty floor, he thought he might have an idea about where all those people had disappeared to.

¬†

One of the agents handed him a report on the man and his history as a test subject. He read it over, frustration sizzling inside of him. The man had been put into the first prototype of the gold chamber for five days straight. As far as they could tell, his body and brain were both completely physically healthy. But EEG scans showed no brain activity beyond his brainstem. The extracted soul was barely anything more than a chunky metaphysical soup, having been torn apart by the chamber.

¬†

Even without the dubious morality of the experiment, the incompetence with which the device had been constructed was appalling. The engineering team working for the government had ignored, or just plain misinterpreted, much of the task force‚Äôs first report. The result had been a malfunctioning gold chamber which could extract minds in their entirety from the body but also tore it into shreds in the process. The fact that the poor bastard was still alive when the maniacs put him in the machine probably didn‚Äôt help either.

¬†

They tried their best to help the broken messes the government was bringing them, although almost all of them were lost causes. They managed to find the problem with the gold chamber during their attempts to help the prisoners. It turned out that exposing the living to the inside of an active gold chamber would always be disastrous, but people who were in the process of dying were another story. A few modifications to the shape of the chamber here, a few changes in the circuitry there, and they had something that had a chance of working as intended.

¬†

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A few weeks later, an opportunity to test the device finally arose. One of their teammates, an electrical engineer with terminal pancreatic cancer, volunteered to be the first to use the device. Her name was Michelle Mullen, and she had been part of the same sub team of Remnant that Bowman had been in. They‚Äôd been close, closer than he‚Äôd ever admitted out loud.

¬†

Bowman wasn‚Äôt on board with this plan. He told her repeatedly that this is not a good idea, that the technology was not nearly mature enough to be considered reliable. But she could not be dissuaded.

¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only fair Anthony. The people opening Pandora‚Äôs box should be the first ones to look inside it.‚Äù She‚Äôd said, a sad but determined smile on her face.

¬†

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Day 712.*

Bowman lifted his pencil off the journal. He usually added a description when he marked a day as significant, but he didn‚Äôt know what to add this time. For all he knew, it could be significant for all the wrong reasons. He decided to leave it empty for now.

¬†

The day Bowman had been dreading had finally come. The gold chamber, a hulking device that roughly looked like an MRI machine, was sitting ominously against one of warehouse‚Äôs walls. Wires and tubes came out of the device‚Äôs side in bundles, connecting the chamber to various computers and coolant pumps stationed nearby.

¬†

An unconscious Michelle was lying on a stretcher in front of the chamber, an assortment of mobile life support machines keeping her alive. *They won‚Äôt be needed for much longer*, Bowman thought, feeling‚Ä¶ feeling what? He didn‚Äôt know how he felt.

¬†

Grief? Perhaps. But was it necessary? He didn‚Äôt know. Anxiety? Definitely. He was not a physician, and the feeling of being responsible for another person‚Äôs life was not one he welcomed. Anticipation? He really didn‚Äôt want to admit it, but he would be lying to himself if he claimed he wasn‚Äôt a little curious to see if they could really pull it off.

¬†

After all, if they succeeded, it would be a one of a kind achievement, arguably greater than any before. Bowman, along with another two of his colleagues, were responsible for conducting today‚Äôs procedure. They pulled out her ventilator and feeding tube, gave her a hefty dose of morphine, and put her inside the chamber.

Once she was inside, Bowman turned on the chamber‚Äôs built-in sensors, which displayed Michelle‚Äôs vital signs on the machine‚Äôs main monitor. Her heart rate was over 120 beats per minute, the organ trying in vain to compensate for her body‚Äôs failing systems. Her brainwaves were slowing down, as her neurons, starved from oxygen, fired the last signals they would ever send.

¬†

Eventually, the last remaining electrical activity fizzled out into nothing. Bowman stared at the flat EEG, clamped down on his emotions, and reminded himself that he had a job to do.

¬†

He turned on the chamber‚Äôs main function through the control program on his laptop. A gentle humming filled the room as sub systems came online, and power surged through the gold covering that lined the inner wall of the chamber. On the screen, he saw the concentration of Michelle‚Äôs soul remaining inside her body steadily decreasing.

¬†

About half an hour later, it hit zero. If everything had worked as intended, Michelle‚Äôs soul was now captured intact by the gold lining inside the chamber. The connection between the gold and her soul would stabilize after about five days, after which meant that the gold lining of the chamber needed to have an electric current running through it for at least that long.

¬†

They pulled out Michelle‚Äôs lifeless body, and discretely sent it to be cremated in a state owned crematorium, which was what she‚Äôd requested. Due to the classified nature of their work, her family probably had no idea any of this was happening, which was another thing weighing heavily on Bowman‚Äôs mind. When all of this was over, he‚Äôd go to them in person and let them know she was still active, if not exactly alive. That, or help them come to terms with her death.

¬†

He didn‚Äôt know if he could live with himself if that came to pass.

¬†

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Day 718, Moment of truth.*

¬†

With her soul now securely anchored to the gold, all that was left was to connect it to the artificial neural network ‚Äì a grey box that looked like a PC case with wheels - that would act as a physical information processing medium in place of her brain. The process was entirely automated, and Bowman didn‚Äôt need to do anything more than press a button on the chamber and wait.

¬†

He hated waiting, having something to do meant he wasn‚Äôt left alone with his own emotions. He picked up his pencil, then immediately put it down again. He got up and started pacing around the warehouse. Someone called out to him, worried about his erratic behavior. He gave a response, but even he didn‚Äôt remember what he said. He was too stressed and keyed up to focus on anything other than the result of the procedure.

¬†

His smartwatch beeped at him. He looked at his wrist. A heartrate warning stared back at him, telling him to take deep breaths and sit down somewhere. Having nothing better to do for now, he listened. Slumping into one of the uncomfortable foldable steel chairs in the main area of the warehouse and doing his best to calm his frayed nerves.

¬†

A few minutes later, a shouting voice called out to him from across the warehouse.

‚ÄúDoctor Bowman! TONY! GET OVER HERE IT‚ÄôS FINISHED!‚Äù

He bolted upright, knocking the chair over in the process. His watch beeped at him again, but he didn‚Äôt care. He ran like a madman, sprinting across the warehouse and coming to a skidding halt a few meters from the chamber.

¬†

He went up to a machine, swiftly finalizing the transfer sequence. The status indicator on the chamber‚Äôs screen turned from red to green, and Bowman undid the clamps connecting the neural network box to the chamber. He rolled the box out a few feet away. Someone handed him three cylindrical, water bottle sized batteries that would serve as the box‚Äôs power source. Ho quickly inserted them into their slots and pressed the power button on the device.

¬†

‚ÄúMichelle?‚Äù

¬†

Everyone leaned in, even the agents. The silence seemed to stretch, an infinity of time compressed into a single moment -

¬†

‚ÄúThat was‚Ä¶ I never want to do that again.‚Äù Michelle‚Äôs voice called out from the box‚Äôs speakers.

¬†

Bowman went slack with relief, feeling like an elephant had moved off his chest. An involuntary wet chuckle escaped him, the tension leaving him in audible form.

¬†

‚ÄúHeh heh! Jesus‚Ä¶ You scared the shit out of me!‚Äù

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They had a problem. A big problem. Their reserves of Fujian Gold were running out. And now that the international task force Remnant had been dissolved, they no longer had access to a fresh supply.

¬†

The government had put out a recall on all items that could possibly contain Fujian gold after Remnant submitted its first report but had wasted a lot of it on their own inept experimentation. Only China could access the true source of Fujian gold, giving them a power over all of humanity that could not be allowed to stand.

¬†

Unbeknownst to him at the time, a strike team of CIA operatives, who were sent over to steal more gold from the Fujian metalworks company, were discovered and executed by Chinese ministry of state security. China had retaliated, the ICBM they fired precisely finding its mark.

¬†

Bowman had been outside on a smoke break, with Michelle rolling beside him in her box, when a sudden brilliant light shone from somewhere behind him, its intensity startling him. Just as he was about to turn around to find at the source, the shockwave reached him. He was lurched off his feet and flung onto the concrete in front of him, the ringing in his ears being the only sound he could hear.

¬†

For several seconds, the pain from the burns on his back and the left side of his face was the only thing he could focus on. When he finally managed to snap out of it, he got up from his prone position on the ground and looked at the warehouse. Or more accurately, its burnt-out husk.

¬†

Finally realizing he‚Äôd been caught in an explosion. He frantically turned around to look for his companion.

¬†

‚ÄúMichelle!? MICHELLE, WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU OKAY?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúOver here Tony! I‚Äôm fine! Are you okay?‚Äù She called out from inside a nearby shrub. She‚Äôd been sent flying. The plant had broken her fall, and the metal of the box was more durable than flesh. But she was upside down, her wheels spinning uselessly in the air.

¬†

‚ÄúMy back hurts a bit, but it‚Äôs not too bad. Fucking hell, what the hell just happend!?‚Äù

¬†

After pulling her box upright and checking it over for damage, Bowman started back at the ruins in a daze, still not quite believing what he was seeing. As far as he knew, they were the only ones who were outside the warehouse. There was a painful sort of irony in his life being saved by being a smoker. He took a step forward, but Michelle‚Äôs voice stopped him.

¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it!‚Äù

¬†

He was good friends with many members of his teammates, and his instincts told him to go in there and save them. But the fire was getting bigger by the second, and even being near it made Bowman‚Äôs back scream with pain. When the ambulance, fire trucks and the DHS finally showed up an hour later, they found a shirtless Bowman sitting on the ground some distance away from the warehouse, one arm wrapped around Michelle‚Äôs box, the other holding his journal, an empty look of horror on his face.

Situation: baby number two on the way. House is a dump. Mums stage 4. Wife's recovering from minor brain surgery and somehow we got one in the oven. I tried to cure her headache and overshot.

What I mean by dump: roof leaking. Wallpaper half finished. Lots of trim to put up. Need to demo bathroom and reline. General painting etc etc

What im after:

1 -  any group chats for dad's doing renos. Full day of work, come home and put the tool belt on battlers. 

2 - audiobooks and podcasts that can help give me more push. Not atomic habits or the subtle art. Charlatans. Not Viktor frankl
 Im still way too happy. 

3 - tips on how to paint in small amounts without buying new roller sleeves and brushes every 2nd weekend. 

If I go hard, if I no zero day this shit, one day life can be perfect. For me my definition of perfect is coffee on my soon to be finished deck. Reading the paper while family wake up slowly and wondering what to do with the day as all my reno jobs would be done. Thats it. And maybe a train set.

Until that day, I went home early to suprise him.
Then I saw my husband in our hot tub, undressed, with another woman.
I stood frozen for several moments and watched as their pecking turned to heavy petting. 
His hand disappeared under the water, and she let out a porn worthy moan. 
He groaned and mumbled something I couldn't hear, and she reached into the water to grab him as well. 
When he lifted her onto his lap, he finally saw me... standing in the doorway between our home and the back yard, tears streaming down my face.
I couldn‚Äôt bear it anymore.
""Ben!"" I yelled, my voice echoing in the air. 
Anger boiling in my veins. How could he do this to me?
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
 Melanie
‚ÄúWhat time will you be home?‚Äù I handed Ben his travel cup and briefcase.
‚ÄúI think it will be an early night for once‚Ä¶ how about you meet me in the city, and we can go dinner tonight?‚Äù Ben shrugged on his coat and gave me a hopeful look.
‚ÄúThat sounds lovely. I‚Äôll Uber to your work that way we can ride home together.‚Äù I gave him a quick pecking. ‚ÄúAround 5 sound good?‚Äù
‚ÄúPerfect.‚Äù He pulled me close to his body and gave me a second, deeper pecking. ‚ÄúI love you more today, Mrs. Landon.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll love you more tomorrow,‚Äù I finished with a little smile.

Even though we had been married for five years and together for ten, he never failed to remind me just how much he loved me. Ben and I grew up on the same street. He was friends with my brother and two years ahead of me, but by the time I was entering my sophomore year of high school, and he was entering his senior year, he had declared to anyone that would listen that I was his forever. We even survived the two years of long distance, and he proposed the day I graduated from high school.

Our parents were absolutely livid when I moved in with him right after high school and chose to skip college and practice being a stay-at-home wife. I had wanted to go to college, but Ben explained that we needed to wait until he finished his degree so he could afford to send me to school. He always made sure to point out just how helpful having me home was for his education and how all his peers were so jealous that he had someone to help him carry his stress. Two years ago, I asked him about pursuing a degree at the community college, but he said it wasn‚Äôt the right time yet because he was just starting to build his wealth and was hoping to start a family soon. It all made sense to me, even if I did think that part of his motivation was that he liked being able to brag about being such a good provider. Honestly, I loved being a stay-at-home wife, and I was really good at being frugal, so I barely cost him anything.
Benjamin was what you might call a ‚Äúfinance bro‚Äù and worked for a big hedge fund company in L.A., and three years ago, he started landing some of the big clients. It turned out he had a sixth sense when it came to investing money, and they jokingly called him Midas at work. From what he told me, he was on track to have a n-et worth of almost five million dollars by the end of the year.

It was a typical Friday for me: I went for my morning walk with a few of the wives from Ben‚Äôs country club, picked up his dry cleaning, went shopping for our weekend meals, cleaned the house, and did a little bit of gardening. By the time it was 3 p.m. I was already worn out, but excited to go on a date with my husband.

I pulled up to his work at 4:55 wearing a bodycon style dress in a dark green that brought out the green in my eyes, two-inch  kitten heels, and a stylish gold blazer. My hair was down in soft curls, and I had gone a little darker and sexier than usual with my makeup. The best part of the outfit was hidden under the dress: a matching dark green lace bra and panty set that I knew Ben was going to love.
When I got to his office, I wasn‚Äôt surprised that he wasn‚Äôt alone. His boss and two women were seated around his desk and discussing one of the clients.
‚ÄúHello!‚Äù I said cheerfully as I stepped into the room.
‚ÄúMrs. Landon! I‚Äôm sorry I wasn‚Äôt out there to greet you!‚Äù Sydney, Ben‚Äôs secretary, said with an apologetic grimace. Sydney was old enough to be my mother and had been with Ben from day one. We had always joked that she wasn‚Äôt actually Ben‚Äôs secretary because she came with the office itself.
‚ÄúNot to worry, Ben knew I was coming.‚Äù I assured her and walked around the desk to stand next to my husband.
I didn‚Äôt recognize the second woman, and we eyed each other briefly with neutral expressions before Ben‚Äôs boss spoke up.
‚ÄúMelanie, you look more beautiful every time I see you.‚Äù Peter said and reached over the desk for my hand. Ben pretended to growl and pulled me into his lap.
‚ÄúEyes to yourself Mr. Nunley!‚Äù Ben joked, and then we all laughed.
‚ÄúMelanie, this is Ms. Reed, my secretary.‚Äù Peter said and waved a hand in the direction of the other woman.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to meet you.‚Äù I said pleasantly. She offered a thin smile and returned the sentiment.
‚ÄúWell, I promised my lovely wife I‚Äôd take her out on a date tonight.‚Äù Ben pecked the top of my head, and I giggled. ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm going to ask you all to get out of my office now.‚Äù He smirked at Peter, ‚Äúand close the door behind you.‚Äù
‚ÄúBen!‚Äù I hissed and smacked his arm.
Everyone but Ms. Reed laughed before they said their goodbyes. She gave both Ben and I a polite smile and head nod before she exited the room.
‚ÄúThat one doesn‚Äôt have the happiest personality, huh?‚Äù I commented after the door clicked shut.
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a little frosty but Peter says she competent and she‚Äôs such an ice queen that Peter‚Äôs wife hasn‚Äôt complained about how young she is.‚Äù Ben shrugged and then turned my head towards his so he could peck me. ‚ÄúHow about a quickie before dinner?‚Äù He wiggled his eyebrows.
‚ÄúMr. Landon!‚Äù I gasped, ‚ÄúAre you propositioning me?‚Äù
‚ÄúI think I am, Mrs. Benjamin Landon.‚Äù He lifted me to his desk and spread my legs so he could stand between them.

‚ÄúAs tempting as that offer is, and believe me it‚Äôs tempting‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt get new lingerie for a quickie on your desk.‚Äù I stuck my tongue out. He quirked a brow and tilted his head to try and look up my dress. I smacked his chest with a giggle and then slid off his desk and to my knees. ‚ÄúI am willing to find out just how waterproof this make up really is though.‚Äù
 I smirked as his face lit up with a giant smile and he started tugging at his belt. Together, we released his trapped shaft, and I gently licked the drop of precum that had formed on the tip. He groaned and sank back into his chair.

‚ÄúHands to yourself!‚Äù I warned before I swallowed half his length in one go. Ben had a habit of wrapping my hair in his hands, but I knew that if he touched my hair, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to wear it down for dinner.
The blowjob only took a few minutes. The taboo nature of having intercourse in his office always had him on the edge, ready to burst, so this was actually my favorite place to give him one. At home, he was a different beast and loved to edge me for hours before giving in and delivering mind-blowing orgasms. The glint in his eyes as he tucked his shaft back into his pants warned that he was just getting started.
‚ÄúJust wait till we get home Mel. I‚Äôm going to make you beg and then I‚Äôm going to make you scream.‚Äù He growled as he tugged me to my feet and smashed his lips against mine in a rough pecking.
‚ÄúPromise?‚Äù I panted.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre killing me,‚Äù he stared into my eyes and grabbed my butt. I brought my lips to his ear and gave a little nip before I spoke.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm starving.‚Äù I whispered.
‚ÄúI just fed you.‚Äù He smirked.
‚ÄúFor food.‚Äù I playfully scowled, and he laughed.
.....
 Melanie
‚ÄúMelanie, I‚Äôm going to be late again tonight.‚Äù Ben sounded distracted as he called for the second time this week to let me know that he wouldn‚Äôt be home for dinner.
‚ÄúOh no, do you want me to bring dinner to you?‚Äù I looked at the time and saw that it was only two p.m. ‚ÄúHave you had lunch?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine baby, thank you for thinking of me.‚Äù I could hear the smile in his voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have something delivered.‚Äù
‚ÄúAlright, be safe.‚Äù I sighed.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù He groaned.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said softly. I didn‚Äôt want to make him feel bad about having to work late, but I did hate eating alone at night. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see if Cassie is available, I added. Cassie was married to one of the guys that Ben golfed with. He worked for the same company but in a different department.
‚ÄúUh, yeah that‚Äôs a good idea.‚Äù Ben mumbled. ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôve gotta go. Don‚Äôt wait up.‚Äù
He ended the call without waiting for me to reply, and I stared at the phone, surprised. Before I could even put it down, my phone dinged.
Hubby: I love you.
Me: More today.
I waited a moment to see if he would reply, but the text was left unread. His next meeting must‚Äôve already started.
....
 Melanie
I woke up to the sound of my husband cursing quietly when he bumped into the dresser.
‚ÄúBen? What time is it?‚Äù I mumbled and sat up slowly.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs late.‚Äù He slurred, ‚ÄúDid you move the dresser?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I giggled.
‚ÄúThe dresser‚Ä¶ it moved.‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you drunk?‚Äù I scowled.
Plastered with a client?
I checked the time.
‚ÄúBen! It‚Äôs two o‚Äôclock in the morning!‚Äù
‚ÄúGo back to sleep.‚Äù He stripped off his jacket and pants, left them in a pile on the floor, and stumbled into the bathroom. The shower kicked on a few seconds later, and I stared at the closed door with confusion.
His phone started ringing in his pocket, and I climbed out of bed to silence it.
Incoming Call: Peter-Work.
Why is his boss calling him from work at 2 a.m.?
‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered quietly.
‚ÄúOh, uhm is Mr. Landon there?‚Äù a woman asked.
‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù I narrowed my eyes at the bathroom door.
‚ÄúThis is Ms. Reed, I‚Äôm just calling to make sure that Mr. Landon made it home safely. The clients kept everyone very late tonight and Benji-Benjamin had quite a few drinks.‚Äù She giggled.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm aware. This is his wife. He‚Äôs home, thank you for checking. I will make sure the let Peter know how dedicated you are to your job.‚Äù I said slowly. Something about her tone had me on edge.
‚ÄúNo need, just doing my job.‚Äù She said quickly. ‚ÄúI should get going.‚Äù
‚ÄúGoodnight Ms. Reed.‚Äù I replied.
‚ÄúGoodnight, Melanie.‚Äù
‚ÄúMrs. Landon‚Ä¶‚Äù I corrected. I didn‚Äôt know her, and it was rude for her to assume she could call me by my first name.
‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù
The water shut off just as I ended the call, and I dropped his phone back on top of his discarded pants. It was only a few moments later before Ben stumbled back into the bedroom, undressed and still glistening with water.
‚ÄúBen, why is Peter‚Äôs secretary calling you at 2 a.m.?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù he spun around and looked at me.
‚ÄúPeter‚Äôs secretary‚Ä¶ just called you from the office.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ she probably just wanted to make sure I got home.‚Äù He opened a drawer and pulled out a pair of boxers.

‚ÄúShe said that the clients kept you‚Ä¶ Since when do you get drunk with clients?‚Äù I climbed back under the blankets and watched him. The muscles in his back tensed, and he didn‚Äôt answer right away.
‚ÄúMelanie, can we talk in the morning?‚Äù He finally asked and turned to look at me. He looked exhausted. He bent down and grabbed his phone on his way to bed.
‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm upset.‚Äù I admitted. This was entirely new territory for me. Ben had never come home drunk like this before.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù He groaned and plugged his phone in before flopping down on the bed.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need an apology I just want to understand‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúTomorrow.‚Äù He snapped, and his phone vibrated on the table. He glanced at the screen and scoffed before swiping away at it. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt handle this conversation right now.‚Äù He rolled away from me.
‚ÄúOkay‚Ä¶‚Äù I whispered, stunned by his attitude.
.....
Ben
I screwed up.
That was all I could think to myself when I woke up in the morning and saw puffy, red-rimmed eyes on my beautiful wife. I knew I had made her cry the night before, even though the details were fuzzy.

The night before had started out as a dinner with clients, but at some point, the clients took their leave, and then Angela and I went to a club. She was a lot of fun outside of the office; the icy exterior slipped away as soon as her hair came down and was replaced by laughter, charming smiles, and lots of dancing.
I had always been careful to keep my extramarital affairs separate from work because that‚Äôs how men got caught. I had a set of strict rules I followed to protect my marriage; nothing serious, three times max, no gifts, no declarations of love, fake name when possible, and always gloved up. While I had never screwed one of my coworkers, I had found myself flirting with a few over the years. After meeting my wife, Angela started staying late at work with me, and we had carefully toed the line between flirty and inappropriate.

Until last night, when I found myself stumbling home at two o‚Äôclock in the morning.
I knew that Melanie hadn‚Äôt fallen for my story and that she was going to expect me to peck her butt for the next few days before she pretended to believe me. The only thing that had worked out in my favor was that I had thought to switch Angela's contact name to ‚ÄòPeter Work‚Äô so it wouldn‚Äôt show as her personal phone, and that she had, without prompting, given me a great cover story.

I hadn‚Äôt screwed her last night but there was definitely some intense making out and fondling in the alley behind the club. She was wild and uninhibited, and I knew I was going to eventually screw her.
Melanie had an air of melancholy as she sat at the kitchen table drinking her coffee. She had left my mug next to the pot but hadn‚Äôt filled it because I took longer than usual to come downstairs. I needed the extra few minutes to double-check my chest and neck for any marks and to get the details of my story straight.

It was a Sunday afternoon in December, and I had spent the day with my friend Lisa in Brookside, Alabama. We‚Äôd had lunch, watched a movie, and laughed about old times. As the day wound down, I decided to head home. Lisa offered to drive me, but I waved her off. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a short walk,‚Äù I said, zipping up my jacket. ‚ÄúI could use the fresh air.‚Äù

Brookside is a small town, the kind where you know most of your neighbors. The streets were quiet, with only a few cars passing by. I felt safe, my mind drifting to what I‚Äôd cook for dinner. Then I noticed a white van parked on the side of the road. It looked like a delivery vehicle, plain and unremarkable. I didn‚Äôt think much of it and kept walking.

But as I continued, the van started moving, slowly trailing behind me. At first, I thought it was a coincidence. Maybe the driver was looking for an address. But when it kept pace with me, a knot formed in my chest. I quickened my steps, hoping to reach the busier part of town.

The van pulled up beside me, and the driver rolled down his window. ‚ÄúExcuse me, miss,‚Äù he called out, his voice calm. ‚ÄúCan you help me with directions? I‚Äôm looking for Main Street.‚Äù

I hesitated. Something about his tone felt off, but I didn‚Äôt want to be rude. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a few blocks that way,‚Äù I said, pointing without getting too close. ‚ÄúTurn left at the next intersection.‚Äù

Before I could step back, he was out of the van, moving faster than I expected. A knife gleamed in his hand. ‚ÄúGet in the van,‚Äù he growled, grabbing my arm.

I tried to yank free, but his grip was like iron. The knife pressed against my side, cold and sharp. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make a sound,‚Äù he warned, his eyes hard.

Terror flooded me. I wanted to scream, but fear choked my voice. He opened the side door and shoved me inside. I stumbled, hitting the floor of the van hard. The door slammed shut, and I heard the lock click. The sound was final, like a cage snapping closed.

The van lurched forward, throwing me against the wall. I scrambled to my feet, my eyes adjusting to the dim light. The back of the van was a nightmare. A metal cage separated me from the driver‚Äôs seat, its bars thick and unyielding. Chains hung from the walls, clinking with every turn. The windows were covered with heavy blankets, blocking out the world. A toolbox was bolted to the floor, its lid slightly ajar, revealing glints of metal inside.

My breath came in short gasps. This wasn‚Äôt just a van‚Äîit was a prison on wheels. I pounded on the cage, my fists aching. ‚ÄúLet me out!‚Äù I screamed. ‚ÄúPlease, let me go!‚Äù

The driver glanced back through the rearview mirror, his face expressionless. ‚ÄúNo one can hear you,‚Äù he said, his voice flat. ‚ÄúThis van is soundproof.‚Äù

The word ‚Äúsoundproof‚Äù sent a shiver through me. He‚Äôd done this before. The chains, the cage‚Äîit was all planned. I thought of stories I‚Äôd heard, warnings about strangers in vans, but they always felt like urban legends. Now, I was living one.

I forced myself to think. Panicking wouldn‚Äôt help. I needed a way out. I scanned the cage, looking for any weakness. The bars were solid, welded tight. The padlock on the cage door was heavy, impossible to break without a key. But then I saw something on the floor‚Äîa small piece of wire, maybe from the chains or the toolbox.

I grabbed it, my hands trembling. I‚Äôd seen people pick locks in movies, but could it work? I knelt by the lock, inserting the wire into the keyhole. My fingers fumbled, the wire slipping. ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù I whispered, trying to feel for the mechanism. But it was no use. The lock held firm.

The van hit a bump, and I fell, the wire skittering across the floor. I crawled to retrieve it, my heart pounding. That‚Äôs when I noticed a backpack tucked under the seat. It wasn‚Äôt mine. With shaking hands, I reached through the bars and pulled it toward me. Inside were clothes, a water bottle, and a small notebook.

I opened the notebook, my eyes scanning the handwritten pages. One entry stopped me cold: ‚ÄúDay 3: Still no food. He‚Äôs keeping me here. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can last.‚Äù The words blurred as tears filled my eyes. Another victim. Had she been trapped in this same cage? What happened to her?

I flipped through more pages, each one a desperate plea for help. The reality hit me like a punch. If I didn‚Äôt get out, I could end up like her‚Äîanother name in a notebook, forgotten.

I searched the backpack again, hoping for something useful. In a side pocket, I found a small pocket knife. My breath caught. It wasn‚Äôt much, but it was something. I tucked it into my sleeve, hiding it from the driver‚Äôs view. If I got a chance, I‚Äôd use it.

The van slowed, and I heard the hum of traffic. We were on a highway now, the engine roaring. I tried to track our direction, but with the windows covered, it was impossible. The driver was silent, his focus on the road. I wondered who he was, why he‚Äôd chosen me. Did he know me? Was this random? The uncertainty gnawed at me.

I thought of Lisa, my parents, my little brother. Would they ever know what happened to me? I wiped my eyes, refusing to give up. I had to stay strong.

Then, a new sound broke through‚Äîthe wail of sirens. My heart leaped. Someone must have seen the kidnapping, called the police. The driver cursed, and the van surged forward, swerving through traffic. I braced myself against the cage, the chains rattling around me.

The sirens grew louder, closer. I could see flashes of red and blue through a tiny gap in the blanket. Hope surged, but so did fear. What if the driver decided to hurt me before the police could reach us?

I banged on the cage again, screaming, ‚ÄúHelp! I‚Äôm in here!‚Äù My voice was hoarse, but I didn‚Äôt stop. If there was even a chance someone could hear me, I had to try.

The van took a sharp turn, and I was thrown against the bars. The driver was desperate now, weaving through traffic. The sirens were right behind us, relentless. I prayed they wouldn‚Äôt lose us.

Suddenly, the van screeched to a halt. I heard tires squealing, then voices shouting. ‚ÄúPolice! Get out of the van with your hands up!‚Äù

The driver swore again, his voice shaking. He opened his door and stepped out. Silence followed, heavy and tense. I held my breath, clutching the pocket knife.

Minutes dragged on. Then, someone tried the back doors. They were locked, but I heard metal scraping, like they were breaking the lock. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs in here!‚Äù I shouted, my voice cracking. ‚ÄúPlease, help me!‚Äù

The doors burst open, and light flooded the van, blinding me. Police officers stood there, guns drawn. One climbed inside, his face kind but urgent. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù he asked, unlocking the cage.

I nodded, tears streaming down my face. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I managed to say. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

They helped me out, wrapping a blanket around my shoulders. I glanced back at the van, its interior now exposed in the daylight. The cage, the chains, the toolbox‚Äîit was all real, not a nightmare I could wake from.

Outside, I saw the driver on his knees, hands cuffed behind his back. Police cars surrounded us, their lights still flashing. A paramedic checked me for injuries, but aside from bruises and a cut on my arm, I was unharmed. Physically, at least.

At the police station, I learned the truth. A witness had seen the kidnapping and followed the van, calling 911 with the license plate and description. That person‚Äôs bravery saved my life. The driver was Sean E. Sanders, a man with a history of violence. He‚Äôd been living in the van until recently and, for reasons I may never know, targeted me.

The police found the notebook and backpack, confirming they belonged to another woman reported missing months earlier. My discovery helped them open a new investigation, hoping to bring closure to her family.

The days after were hard. Nightmares woke me, images of that cage haunting my sleep. I flinched at the sight of white vans, my heart racing. But with therapy and support from my loved ones, I began to heal. I became more cautious, trusting my instincts when something felt wrong.

That day changed me, but it also showed me the power of a stranger‚Äôs courage. Without that witness, I might not be here. I‚Äôll always be grateful for the second chance I was given, and I‚Äôll never forget the horror of that van‚Äîor the hope that pulled me through.





# ""No Way Out: A Stranger Tracked Me into the Wild"":

I never thought I‚Äôd be writing about this, but here I am, sharing one of the scariest experiences of my life. I‚Äôm a 55-year-old woman, living in my van with my loyal dog, Max, a German Shepherd mix who‚Äôs been my constant companion for six weeks on the road. The freedom of van life is incredible‚Äîwaking up to new landscapes, living simply, chasing adventure. But it comes with risks, especially for a solo traveler like me. Nothing could have prepared me for what happened in Death Valley, California, in November 2021.

I had set up camp in a remote part of Death Valley, far from the main roads. The desert stretched endlessly around me, mountains looming in the distance, stars glittering above. It felt peaceful, almost magical. But the day before, something unsettling happened. I stopped at a gas station to refuel, and a man approached me. He was white, in his late 40s, wearing dark sunglasses and a bright white short-sleeve polo shirt. His smile was forced, his eyes hidden behind those shades, and his questions about my van and travel plans felt too personal.¬†

‚ÄúNice setup you got there,‚Äù he said, leaning closer than I liked. ‚ÄúYou out here all alone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm meeting friends,‚Äù I lied, my voice steady but my insides twisting. I finished pumping gas quickly, got in my van, and drove off. In my rearview mirror, I saw him watching me, standing by his Mitsubishi rental car. The encounter left a bad taste, but I tried to brush it off.

That night, around 4 am, I woke to strange noises‚Äîscratching and rocking inside my van. My heart jumped. Max was growling, his ears perked, fur bristling. I crept to the window and peeked out. There, right behind my van, was the Mitsubishi, blocking my only way out. The man from the gas station was back. He‚Äôd followed me.

Panic hit me like a wave. I was trapped, miles from anyone, with no cell service. I locked every door, my hands shaking as I checked the latches. Footsteps crunched outside, slow and deliberate. The van rocked harder, like he was testing the door, trying to find a way in. Max‚Äôs barks turned ferocious, echoing in the small space. I whispered to him, ‚ÄúGood boy, keep it up,‚Äù hoping his noise would scare the man off.

I grabbed my satellite phone, my lifeline in remote areas, and sent frantic texts to friends and family: ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs trying to get into my van. I‚Äôm in Death Valley. Please help.‚Äù I snapped photos of the car through the window, catching part of the license plate in the dim light. Every creak of the van, every shuffle outside, made my chest tighten. I imagined him breaking in, and my mind raced with worst-case scenarios.

‚ÄúOpen the door!‚Äù he shouted, his voice slurred, like he was drunk or worse. I stayed silent, clutching Max, praying he‚Äôd give up. The rocking stopped for a moment, then started again, more violently. I thought about honking the horn but worried it might make him angry. Minutes dragged on, each one endless. Then, suddenly, a car door slammed. An engine roared to life. I peeked out and saw the Mitsubishi speeding away, taillights fading into the dark.

Relief flooded me, but fear lingered. I couldn‚Äôt stay there. I started the van and drove to a nearby trailhead where other campers were parked. Their presence felt like a shield. From there, I headed to a small restaurant I‚Äôd seen earlier, parking in the back to stay out of sight. My hands were still trembling as I sent another round of texts, letting everyone know I was safe but shaken.

Inside the restaurant, the smell of coffee and bacon was a small comfort. I ordered a coffee and sat in a booth, trying to steady my breathing. The waitress, a kind woman in her 50s with a warm smile, noticed my unease. ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôve had a rough night,‚Äù she said, refilling my cup.

I hesitated, then spilled the story. ‚ÄúLast night, this guy followed me to my campsite. He tried to break into my van. I was so scared.‚Äù

Her eyes widened. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awful! Are you okay? Did you call the police?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo cell service out here,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut I took photos of his car. I‚Äôm reporting it to the rangers.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she said, nodding. ‚ÄúYou need to tell someone. We get all kinds of folks passing through, but most are harmless. Still, you can‚Äôt be too careful.‚Äù

She let me stay as long as I needed, and I spent hours there, sipping coffee, trying to calm down. Later, I used my satellite phone to email the local rangers, attaching the photos and describing every detail‚Äîthe man‚Äôs appearance, his car, the terrifying ordeal. They replied quickly, confirming the car was a rental and saying they‚Äôd keep the information on file in case anything else happened.

I stayed in my van the rest of the day, doors locked, even though the heat was brutal‚Äî94 degrees outside, 92 inside without AC. I only left to walk Max, gripping pepper spray and a knife, scanning every shadow. The experience left me rattled, but it also made me stronger. I‚Äôve always been cautious, but now I‚Äôm hyper-vigilant, parking in well-lit areas, trusting my gut when something feels wrong.

Max was my hero that night. His barking likely saved me, and I owe him everything. Sharing this story is hard, but I want others in the van life community to know the risks. The road is beautiful, but it can be unpredictable. Stay alert, stay prepared, and lean on your community. It‚Äôs what keeps us safe.





# ""The White Van That Took Her"":

It was 1979, and Andrea and I were both 15 years old, living in Huntington Beach, California. We were best friends‚Äîinseparable. We shared everything: secrets, dreams, and our love for music and fashion. Andrea was the kind of person who lit up a room with her smile. She had long, dark hair, often tied back in a ponytail, and bright blue eyes that sparkled with mischief. She was always laughing, always joking, always making everyone around her feel better.

We spent our days at the beach, tanning and swimming, building sandcastles and chasing waves. Our nights were filled with sleepovers, where we‚Äôd stay up late talking about boys, school, and our future plans. Andrea wanted to be a fashion designer. She was always sketching clothes, her pencil flying across the page as she dreamed up new styles. I remember her showing me her designs, her eyes lighting up as she described her vision for each piece. ‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs for a summer party,‚Äù she‚Äôd say, pointing to a flowing dress. ‚ÄúAnd this one‚Äôs for a big city runway.‚Äù She was so full of life, so full of hope.

But on September 3, 1979, everything changed.

Andrea didn‚Äôt show up for school that day. That wasn‚Äôt like her; she was always on time. We had plans to meet after school to go to the mall, maybe try on some clothes and grab ice cream. But when she didn‚Äôt show up at our usual spot by the school gates, I started to worry. I tried calling her house from a payphone, but there was no answer. Her mother worked late as a nurse, and her father was often away on business, so it wasn‚Äôt unusual for her to be home alone. But she always answered the phone.

‚ÄúHey, Andrea, where are you?‚Äù I said into the receiver, hoping she‚Äôd pick up. The line just rang and rang. I hung up, my hands shaking a little. Something felt off.

Worried, I decided to walk to her house after school. It was only a few blocks away, through a quiet neighborhood with palm trees and tidy lawns. When I got there, the house was empty. Her bed was made, her school bag was gone, but her beat-up old car was still in the driveway. That didn‚Äôt make sense. Andrea never went anywhere without telling me.

I knocked on the door. ‚ÄúAndrea? You in there?‚Äù No answer. I checked the windows, but the curtains were drawn. I sat on her front porch, waiting, hoping she‚Äôd come home with some silly explanation. Maybe she‚Äôd skipped school to hang out with someone else, though that wasn‚Äôt like her. As the sun dipped low, casting the street in a golden glow, I scribbled a note: ‚ÄúAndrea, call me when you get home. I‚Äôm worried. ‚Äì Emily.‚Äù I tucked it into the doorframe and left, my stomach tight with unease.

The next day, the news hit like a punch to the gut. A young girl‚Äôs body had been found in the hills near Whittier, about an hour‚Äôs drive away. It was Andrea.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I sat in my room, staring at the wall, trying to make sense of it. How could this happen? Who would do this to my friend? Andrea, with her sketches and her laughter, was gone. I kept seeing her face, hearing her voice. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna be famous someday, Emily,‚Äù she‚Äôd said once, grinning. Now she was gone, and I didn‚Äôt even get to say goodbye.

The police investigation moved fast. They said Andrea had been abducted while walking home from school. Witnesses reported seeing a white van in the area, parked on a side street near the school. Later, they confirmed she‚Äôd been taken by two men in that van. The details were sparse at first, but as the days turned into weeks, more bodies were found‚Äîall young women, all victims of the same killers. The media called them the ‚ÄúToolbox Killers‚Äù because of the tools they used to torture their victims. The name made my skin crawl.

I couldn‚Äôt believe such evil existed. Andrea was gone, and there was nothing I could do to bring her back. I went to her funeral, standing by her grave as her mother sobbed. I wanted to scream, to demand answers, but all I could do was cry.

I needed justice. I needed those monsters caught.

Months later, the police arrested two men: Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris. They were charged with the murders of five young women, including Andrea. During their trial, I learned things I wish I could forget. They had recorded their crimes, taping the screams and pleas of their victims. The recordings were so horrific that the judge wouldn‚Äôt allow them to be played in court. But the transcripts were read aloud, and I sat there, gripping the bench, as the words painted a picture of unimaginable cruelty.

Bittaker and Norris were sentenced to death, but Norris later turned state‚Äôs evidence against Bittaker in exchange for a life sentence. I went to every day of the trial, sitting in the courtroom, staring at the men who had taken my friend‚Äôs life. They didn‚Äôt look like monsters. They looked ordinary‚Äîtwo men in suits, one with a baseball cap he‚Äôd worn during the crimes, the other with a smirk that made my blood boil. I wanted them to see me, to see the pain they‚Äôd caused, to know they hadn‚Äôt just destroyed lives‚Äîthey‚Äôd shattered families and communities.

The trial revealed how they operated. They had outfitted their white van with a bed, chains, and a toolbox filled with pliers, hammers, and knives. They‚Äôd drive around, looking for young women walking alone. They‚Äôd offer a ride, and if the girl refused, they‚Äôd grab her. Andrea was their second victim. She‚Äôd been walking home from school, probably thinking about her sketches or our plans for the weekend, when they spotted her.

‚ÄúHey, need a lift?‚Äù one of them had called out, according to a witness who‚Äôd seen the van but couldn‚Äôt stop it in time. Andrea, always polite, probably shook her head. But they didn‚Äôt take no for an answer. They forced her into the van, and she was gone.

I can only imagine the terror she felt, trapped in that van with those monsters. The thought haunts me every night. They took her to a remote spot, where they tortured her for hours before ending her life. The details were too gruesome to repeat, but they stayed with me, burned into my mind.

After Andrea, they killed three more girls, each one taken in that same van. The police finally caught them after a witness reported seeing a van matching the description near where another body was found. When they searched it, they found blood, hair, and tools that linked it to the crimes.

Norris confessed first, spilling details only the killer would know. He claimed Bittaker was the mastermind, that he‚Äôd been coerced. But I didn‚Äôt buy it. They were both guilty, both responsible for the pain they caused.

Even with them behind bars, the pain didn‚Äôt fade. Andrea‚Äôs absence was a hole in my life. I‚Äôd walk by her house, expecting to see her waving from the porch, but it was always empty. I kept her sketches, tucking them away in a box, unable to look at them but unable to let them go.

I often think about that white van, wondering how many other lives it claimed, how many other families it destroyed. It‚Äôs become a symbol of evil in my mind, a reminder that danger can lurk anywhere, even in a quiet neighborhood on a sunny day.",1,1754188447.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Am I experiencing withdrawal or kindling?","Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been taking 10mg of Prozac daily for several years. In December 2022, I briefly increased to 20mg for about a month, then tapered back down to 10mg. Things seemed relatively stable overall, and occasionally missing a dose didn‚Äôt cause any problems.

But in June 2023, everything changed. I walked past someone smoking weed and got a strong secondhand whiff. After that, I felt sedated and ‚Äúoff,‚Äù and the world began to look strangely ‚Äúvideo game-like.‚Äù That moment marked the beginning of a cascade of physical and psychological issues.

Since then, I‚Äôve experienced:
	‚Ä¢	Shortness of breath
	‚Ä¢	Sudden, random panic
	‚Ä¢	Most distressingly: intense food sensitivities and digestive problems

Foods I used to tolerate‚Äîlike Coke, baked goods, or coffee‚Äîstarted triggering severe symptoms. For example, a sip of Coke caused me to wake up in the middle of the night with my heart pounding, a hot flash across my head, and uncontrollable panic. I was pacing, convinced I needed to go to the ER.

I lost a significant amount of weight because eating began to trigger symptoms. I suspected serotonin syndrome and brought this to my doctor‚Äôs attention. We agreed to start tapering off Prozac.

In November 2023, I began a taper using a 2-days-on, 1-day-off schedule. However, this triggered new symptoms‚Äîintense rage, dissociation, and physical discomfort, particularly after certain foods (e.g., bagels and cream cheese).

Over several months, I shifted to 1-day-on/1-day-off, and eventually to 2-days-off/1-day-on. During this taper, I developed severe swallowing issues and couldn‚Äôt eat or drink properly. I underwent numerous tests, but nothing conclusive was found.

Eventually, I reverted to 1-day-on/1-day-off, and my swallowing issues began to improve. I also started taking a PPI for burning stomach symptoms. Things were slowly getting better‚Äîuntil my therapist strongly encouraged me to return to the full 10mg dose.

I reluctantly agreed. But within days, I began experiencing:
	‚Ä¢	Vivid, intense dreams
	‚Ä¢	Surges of panic and physical discomfort
	‚Ä¢	Severe food reactions (even plain rice would trigger symptoms that felt like vertigo)
	‚Ä¢	Heart palpitations
	‚Ä¢	Cognitive decline: racing, disorganized thoughts, difficulty focusing, and a drugged/derealized feeling

I‚Äôve since returned to the 1-day-on/1-day-off schedule. Some symptoms have lessened, but I‚Äôm still dealing with food sensitivities, vivid dreams, cognitive fog, and what feels like constant brain chatter. I can‚Äôt focus, think clearly, or feel grounded.

My doctor hasn‚Äôt been helpful, and I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in a withdrawal loop‚Äîor possibly kindling. I‚Äôm terrified I‚Äôve caused long-term damage and I don‚Äôt know what to do next.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Could this be kindling? Is there any hope for recovery?

1mg7x72,https://www.reddit.com/r/prozac/comments/1mg7x72/am_i_going_through_kindling_or_just_withdrawal/,Am I going through kindling or just withdrawal symptoms?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been on 10mg of Prozac daily for several years. Aside from a one-month increase to 20mg in December 2022 (which I then tapered back down from), things were relatively stable. I would occasionally miss a day here or there without major issues.

But in June 2023, something strange happened. I walked past someone smoking weed and got a strong secondhand whiff. From that point I felt that I got a second hand high. The next day, I felt sedated and noticed the world looked strangely ‚Äúvideo game-like.‚Äù That was the beginning of a nightmare.

Since then, I‚Äôve had:
	‚Ä¢	Shortness of breath
	‚Ä¢	Random panic
	‚Ä¢	And most disturbingly: intense food sensitivities and digestive issues

I started reacting to things like Coke, baked goods, coffee‚Äîfoods I used to tolerate fine. Even a sip of soda would bring on panic, detachment, and other weird sensations. I took a sip of coke and woke up in the night with heart beating through my chest and hot flash all over my head and I was running back and forth thinking I need to go to the ER.

I lost a lot of weight because eating started triggering symptoms.

I suspected serotonin syndrome and spoke to my doctor. We agreed to taper. I began in November 2023 with a 2-days-on, 1-day-off pattern. That led to new reactions‚Äîrage, dissociation, body-wide discomfort‚Äîespecially after foods like bagels and cream cheese.

After several months, I transitioned to 1-day-on, 1-day-off, then to 2-days-off, 1-day-on. During the taper, I developed severe trouble swallowing and couldn‚Äôt eat or drink. I did every test imaginable‚Äînothing conclusive.

I reverted to 1-day-on, 1-day-off, and with time my swallowing also slowly improved. I also began taking a PPI for stomach discomfort. Things were stabilizing until my therapist pressured me to return to the full 10mg dose.

Against my instincts, I caved. Within days:
	‚Ä¢	Vivid, intense dreams
	‚Ä¢	Panic surges throughout my body
	‚Ä¢	Severe food reactions (even plain rice made the world feel like it was tilting ‚Äî maybe vertigo?)
	‚Ä¢	Heart palpitations
	‚Ä¢	Cognitive decline: racing thoughts, inability to focus, drugged feeling

I dropped back to the 1-day-on, 1-day-off schedule again. Some symptoms improved, but the food issues, vivid dreams, and cognitive impairment remain. My stomach still burns after certain foods. I feel my brains always chattering, and unable to think clearly.

I‚Äôve tried asking my doctor, but they‚Äôre no help. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in some kind of withdrawal or kindling loop and have no idea how to escape. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôve done long-term damage.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? Am I going through kindling? Is there any way out?

1mg7vtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mg7vtf/no_questions_asked_part_2/,No Questions Asked -- Part 2,"‚ÄúWhere did you run off to?‚Äù Grace asked as I made my way through the front door. I was so bewildered by my time at the Calhoun residence that I hadn‚Äôt come up with a believable excuse. Improv don't fail me now. ‚ÄúI just went out for a jog, decided to go a few laps around the neighborhood.‚Äù I pretended to be out of breath. Her eyes almost immediately trained on what I was wearing on my feet. ‚ÄúYou went running in your boots?‚Äù Damn, she was good. ‚ÄúYeah, I read somewhere online that it helps to build up certain muscles that regular shoes don‚Äôt.‚Äù I thought back to what Maggie had told me, about the differences between a man and a weasel. Maybe I was a weasel after all. Grace stared me down, her face filled with skepticism. ‚ÄúWell.‚Äù she said finally, ‚Äúif your calves aren‚Äôt killing you tomorrow, I‚Äôll know you‚Äôre full of it.‚Äù I laughed, relieved that I potentially had an out. I went in for a kiss but was stopped dead in my tracks by her outstretched arm. ‚ÄúYou need to take a shower if you plan on being within ten feet of me, Richard. You smell like you jogged straight into a landfill.‚Äù If only she knew how bad it truly was.

I chuckled to myself and made my way towards the shower, peeling off my clothes as I went. The stench of Maggie‚Äôs home still clung to me. The mildew, musk and decay was ever present. It was in my pores, my hair, even under my nails. I turned the water on as hot as it would go, stepped inside, and tried to wash the whole experience down the drain. It didn‚Äôt work. The entire morning replayed again and again in my head. And worse, even with soap in my eyes, I kept seeing him. That unnatural posture, the way his eyes gleamed like glass. And Maggie‚Ä¶ dancing with him like it was the most natural thing in the world. Talking to him. Arguing. Laughing. I finished rinsing off and stood under the stream until the water turned cold. I lost track of time until there was a knock at the bathroom door. ‚ÄúAre you doing alright in there, babe?‚Äù Grace‚Äôs voice snapped me back to reality. ‚ÄúYup, just getting in those hard-to-reach spots. Unless you were wanting to help?‚Äù I could hear her snickering on the other side of the door. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve got it covered, bud. You‚Äôd better hurry up though, your coffee is getting colder by the second.‚Äù I began to dry myself off, only to catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I could barely recognize the man that stared back at me. Pale. Hollow-eyed. Haunted. You two look so much alike. I shook it off and began to get dressed. 

Grace had already moved onto her second cup of coffee by the time I caught up with her. She glanced at me and raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúJog do you good?‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúLike a charm.‚Äù She handed me a mug. ‚ÄúYou going to rest today, or do you have another ‚Äòjog‚Äô in you?‚Äù I opened my mouth to respond when suddenly I felt my phone begin to vibrate in my pocket. I glanced at the number calling. It was Mrs. Rodriguez, presumably trying to either reschedule or to share more of her wonderful vocabulary with me. I motioned to pick up her call until I realized Grace had been watching me. Tears welled in her eyes. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù she warned. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù I hesitated, then declined the call. ‚ÄúNot today.‚Äù Her shoulders loosened a little, and she gave me a small nod. I took a seat at the kitchen table and let the warmth of the coffee calm my nerves. Things were normal for the rest of the day. I even used some of the money from Mrs. Calhoun to take Grace out to a fancy Italian place for dinner. Life had returned to how it was before the daily hustle and bustle of the electrical world. I was thankful. Even if this trip down memory lane were to last for one day, it was worth it to see sparks in my wife‚Äôs eyes again. It would be the last time I‚Äôd ever see her this happy.

 I jolted awake the next morning from the sound of an incoming call. Being wine drunk the night prior, I forgot to set any kind of alarm for myself and was positive a customer was calling to really let me have it for being a no-show. Instead, to my surprise, it was the last number I had saved to my phone. It was Maggie. Seeing this instantly sobered me up from the previous night‚Äôs bender. I contemplated letting her call go to voicemail, but the thought that something was wrong kept eating away at me. I knew I would regret it, but I decided to answer the phone. ‚ÄúGood morning Maggie, how are things in your neck of the woods?‚Äù There was no response. Only the sounds of screaming on the other line. Angry screaming, followed shortly by the sound of glass shattering. I sprung to my feet, the sudden surge of adrenaline pushing me towards the front door. ‚ÄúMrs. Calhoun? Is everything okay?‚Äù She once again refused to respond. I was able to make out another voice, one that I didn‚Äôt recognize at the time. It was a woman‚Äôs voice. She continuously repeated the same two words. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

I raced to get my boots on before my mind could fully comprehend what I had just heard. I was so preoccupied with lacing them up that I hadn‚Äôt noticed Grace in the kitchen, watching me as breakfast cooked on the stovetop behind her. ‚ÄúWhere are you off to in such a hurry?‚Äù My ears perked up at the sound of her voice. I lost my grip on the laces and was forced to start over again. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm late for an appointment, Grace. How long have you been awake for?‚Äù Her attention returned to the scrambled eggs on the stove. ‚ÄúA few hours now.‚Äù I could feel my blood pressure rising in real time. ‚ÄúAnd you didn‚Äôt think to wake me up?‚Äù She looked back to me, the tone in her voice becoming defensive. ‚ÄúI thought maybe you decided to take another day off, Richard. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry. I began lacing faster. ‚ÄúWell if you‚Äôre already late, would it hurt to have breakfast with me before you go?‚Äù She motioned to the dining room table where an already plated meal sat for me. I grabbed my keys and reached for the door. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt, maybe another time.‚Äù As I closed the door behind me, I could faintly make out Grace‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ another time.‚Äù 

I pulled into Mrs. Calhoun‚Äôs driveway in time to see the mystery woman barge out of the home. Upon seeing her face, I was filled with both relief as well as confusion. It was Cheryl the caregiver. I began to get out of the van when suddenly Maggie stumbled out after her, shouting incoherently. She raised something up to her face and pointed it forward. It was only then that I noticed the side-by-side that she had aimed at Cheryl‚Äôs back. Her personal twin barrels of justice. I began shouting and waving my arms erratically, all to give Cheryl even the slightest chance of survival. ‚ÄúMaggie, stop!‚Äù Her attention, as well as her firearm were drawn towards me now. ‚ÄúYou! This is all your fault‚Ä¶ all your fau‚Ä¶‚Äù Her demeanor had changed. What was just rage flowing through her veins had suddenly turned to sorrow. She turned and pointed inside her home. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt hear him anymore.‚Äù Cheryl was now cowering beside me, her face a dark red and tears streaming down her cheeks. ‚ÄúI told her I was sorry, Richard. I don‚Äôt know what else she wants from me!‚Äù I gestured towards her vehicle. ‚ÄúGo home, I‚Äôm sure I can take care of the situation here.‚Äù She hesitated for a moment before mouthing a muted ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù My eyes returned to where Mrs. Calhoun was once standing, but she was no longer there. There was no question where she was, to find her I only had to follow the distant wailing that was now coming from inside the house.

I stepped through the threshold of Maggie‚Äôs home, the door slowly creaking closed behind me. The air was somehow even thicker than it was the day before. It clung to the inside of my lungs, causing my already nervous breathing to become even more exasperated. ‚ÄúMaggie?‚Äù My shaky voice echoed throughout the home. There was no response, just the continued cries from deeper within. I followed the noise, eventually leading back into the parlor. The same lamp from before buzzed quietly in the corner, flickering ever so slightly. The light from the lamp wasn‚Äôt casting light on an empty room, but on a scene that still replays in my head to this day. Mrs. Calhoun was huddled on the floor, her body crumpled like a paper bag. Her fingers trembled as she clutched something in her hands. It was the head of Anthony. I looked into the corner of the room where the rest of him was sprawled out on the floor. His arms, which were once set neatly at his sides, had bent backwards at the elbow. His clothes had become heavily disheveled and his shoes had been knocked clear off his feet. The place where his head once rested was now just a neck with a crude metal bar protruding from it. If I hadn‚Äôt known better, I‚Äôd say this was the work of a two-ton grizzly bear, not a sweet caregiver in her forties. Mrs. Calhoun began rocking back and forth, still holding onto her husband. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be okay, Anthony. We‚Äôre going to be okay.‚Äù

I stood frozen in the doorway. There was nothing I could say. What comfort could I offer a woman mourning the death of her husband for a second time? After a while of watching from the sidelines, I decided to finally speak up. ‚ÄúMaggie,‚Äù I started carefully, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve gone through so much. Maybe it‚Äôs time to‚Ä¶ let him go.‚Äù Her head snapped up at me. ‚ÄúLet go?‚Äù she hissed. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm crazy, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù Her tear streaked eyes bore straight into mine, wild and unblinking. ‚ÄúBut you saw it too. I know you did.‚Äù I inched closer towards her. ‚ÄúI saw a man who meant a lot to you,‚Äù I said gently. ‚ÄúThat much is true. But he‚Äôs gone, Maggie. He‚Äôs gone and he can‚Äôt come back. Whatever voice you heard, whatever comfort he gave you, it was you giving that to yourself. Because that‚Äôs what you needed at the time.‚Äù I knelt down beside her, resting a hand on her shoulder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to let him go.‚Äù She stared at me for a long while. Her shoulders trembled in my hand. For a moment, I thought she was going to scream. Or worse. But instead, she just laid her head against Anthony‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôre right,‚Äù she sniffed. She paused to look down at the head, then held it up in front of her. She glanced back and forth between the two of us. ‚ÄúIt really is uncanny, huh? The resemblance?‚Äù I helped her slowly get up from off the floor. I was relieved to see that her smile had returned. ‚ÄúHow does a spot of tea sound, dear?‚Äù

We sat together in silence, sipping away on mint chamomile. There were shattered cups and plates scattered across the floor, ones that appeared to have been thrown in a fit of rage. ‚ÄúWhat happened with Cheryl, if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?‚Äù Maggie lowered her cup from her lips. ‚ÄúI gave her a call yesterday after you had left. Anthony told me if you trusted her then so could we.‚Äù She placed her glass on the coffee table. ‚ÄúAt first she seemed like such a sweetheart. That was until she saw my Anthony. Got all skittish after that. Said she wasn‚Äôt comfortable working around him.‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt say I blamed her. She continued her retelling. ‚ÄúI told her if she wanted to get paid she would show my husband the respect he was owed. I said she had better clean him up good, that I wanted to see him sparkling by the time she was done.‚Äù Mrs. Calhoun‚Äôs face failed to hide the disdain she felt towards Cheryl. ‚ÄúWell, I decided to step away for five minutes until I heard a crashing sound from the parlor. I came racing in to find him how you saw him just now.‚Äù I nodded my head as she recounted her story. There was still one question that kept racing through my mind through all of it. ‚ÄúWhy did you decide to call me?‚Äù She sat for a moment, stirring her tea with a spoon. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt the first person I called, Richard. I tried reaching out to my son but he never picked up.‚Äù I was taken aback by her response, that was until I remembered the small boy from the photographs.

 ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve mentioned having a son before.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt answer right away. Just sat there, swirling her spoon in that lukewarm tea like she could stir the right words to the surface. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt, not usually,‚Äù She murmured. ‚ÄúJason‚Ä¶ he adored his father,‚Äù she continued, her voice softening. ‚ÄúHe was always following Anthony around as a boy. Picking up tools in the garage, trying to walk the way he walked.  I used to joke that he was his father‚Äôs shadow.‚Äù She paused, running a finger along the rim of her cup. ‚ÄúWhen Anthony passed, Jason took it harder than anyone. He was absolutely devastated, that was until he decided to take over his father‚Äôs business. Said he could continue his legacy in that way. But now I hardly ever hear from him. It‚Äôs like I lost the both of them at the same time.‚Äù I now understood why she hadn‚Äôt mentioned Jason earlier, it seemed as much a sore spot as the decapitated body in the corner. I took another sip of my tea. Mint chamomile. There was an odd, chemical bitterness tucked beneath the usual herbal notes. Faint, but unmistakable. I swallowed anyway. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad I made it in time before things got too hairy between you and Cheryl.‚Äù Maggie nodded in agreement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here too.‚Äù My fingertips began to tingle slightly. My eyelids felt heavier than they had a moment ago. I blinked slowly. My heart rate was steady, but the air around me felt thick. Like breathing through wool. I looked down into my cup, there were miniscule particles of something that were still settling to the bottom of the glass from my last drink. My vision began to blur at the edges.

‚ÄúMaggie,‚Äù I said, my voice slurring slightly, ‚Äúwhat‚Ä¶ what was in the tea?‚Äù I tried to stand, but my legs gave out beneath me. I caught myself against the side of the armchair, panting like some heat exhausted animal. Her voice didn‚Äôt change from before. It was soft, almost motherly in tone. ‚ÄúJust a touch of diazepam. A very mild benzodiazepine. Nothing serious. Doctors prescribe it every day.‚Äù My stomach began to violently churn. I gripped the edge of the table but it felt as if it were floating away from me. ‚ÄúWhy‚Ä¶ why would you do that?‚Äù She stood and stepped toward me, gently plucking the half-full cup from my weakened hand. ‚ÄúBecause you were going to leave,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúJust like Jason did. Just like everyone does.‚Äù She walked across the room, picking up Anthony‚Äôs head from off the floor. ‚ÄúI was unsure why Anthony said you could be trusted, after all you were still a stranger in our home. Until suddenly, it all made sense. You were chosen. My Anthony picked you.‚Äù My energy was completely spent, the only words I managed to get out barely escaped my lips. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making a mistake, please just‚Ä¶ just let me go home.‚Äù My consciousness was fading, but before blacking out I was able to make out one final message from Mrs. Calhoun. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôre already home, my love.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know how long I was out for. I only remember groggily waking up to a skull splitting migraine. Things were dark wherever I was. Even in the darkness I knew my current situation was unfavorable to say the least. I could feel the cold steel of the handcuffs that bound my wrists together. It seemed my legs were tied as well, but with what I was uncertain. I tried to speak, tried to cry out into the darkness for help, but found something had been pressed against my lips. Something stiff and tasting of wax. Breathing had become noticeably obstructed, and even upon managing to inhale I quickly wished I hadn‚Äôt. The aroma was a combination of sickly sweet and vinegar. One that I faintly recognized from my brief interactions with Anthony. It was the smell of formaldehyde. I‚Äôd always heard that when you lose access to one of your senses, another is in turn elevated. But this didn‚Äôt turn out to be true. Turns out all of them are enhanced to some degree, none more than one's hearing. I could hear the rush of water in the pipework overhead and the electrical humming of a nearby appliance. What unnerved me was that somewhere in all the commotion, I could vaguely make out her shaky, excited breathing. Somewhere in the darkness she had been waiting for me to wake up. I could hear her weary joints pop back to life as she stood from wherever she had been seated. ‚ÄúOh, Anthony‚Ä¶‚Äù Maggie‚Äôs voice trembled with joy. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre finally awake.‚Äù

I could hear the click of a pull chain as the bulb above me flickered on. There she was, bent over just a few inches away from my face. The way she was dressed was different from how I had previously seen her. She wore a clean, freshly pressed dress. Her hair was pulled back neatly. She wore a shade of lipstick I hadn‚Äôt seen before, the kind a woman saves for special occasions. I looked down to see my feet had been fastened to the legs of the chair she had entrapped me in. My peripheral vision was nearly nonexistent, but I chalked that up to my eyes adjusting to the light. She looked me up and down and smiled. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs really you.‚Äù She began rambling to herself as she walked back into the darkness where I could no longer see her. When she returned, she was holding a full body mirror close to her chest. She faced it towards me with a boisterous ‚Äúta-da!‚Äù I strained my eyes to get a decent look at myself in the reflection only to be met with confusion. I was lavishly dressed in a suit that I had no recollection of wearing. One that didn‚Äôt belong to me. My face didn‚Äôt belong to me either. It was his.  I moaned against the thing stretched over my face. I wanted to scream, to tear the grotesque mask off my skin. But I couldn‚Äôt. It was fixed in place, sewn or glued or God knows what. I could feel it conforming to me. Every ridge, every wrinkle of another man‚Äôs life stretched over my own. 

She knelt back in front of me with reverence, cupping my face, his face, like she was greeting a lover returning from war. She leaned closer, her lips brushing the edge of the dead skin. ‚ÄúYou clean up good, old man.‚Äù She laughed to herself. I tried to plead with her, but my words came out muffled and incomprehensible. She turned her head at me, almost like a curious dog would. That‚Äôs when the realization hit her, ‚ÄúI see your problem dear.‚Äù She fingered the fleshy mouth open just enough to hear my voice. ‚ÄúMaggie, please, this is insane. Eventually the police will come looking for me. Just‚Ä¶ just let me go. I promise I won‚Äôt tell a soul about any of this!‚Äù My words held no gravity, not in her mind. She simply began humming a tune and wandered back into the pitch black. She wheeled a cart into view, one holding a dusty gramophone that was surrounded by all kinds of tools. A bone saw, scalpels, screwdrivers. All rusted. All stained. ‚ÄúCare for a dance?‚Äù She cranked the handle until the machine groaned to life. The needle scratched across the vinyl, the warped melody of an old waltz sputtered to life. It was hauntingly out of tune, but Maggie didn‚Äôt seem to mind. She held me by the shoulders and began to sway back and forth. I tried to cry out once again, but my voice ragged against the tight mouth of the mask. She didn‚Äôt flinch. Her mind was somewhere else, lost in the rhythm of the music and her twisted fantasies coming to life. I was trembling. My body wanted to shut down, to dissociate, to escape in any way it could. But survival has a cruel way of keeping you just alert enough to witness things you wished you hadn‚Äôt.

She spoke, all while continuing to dance. ‚ÄúDo you remember this song? This is what we had our first dance to. I remember every detail of that day. The ceremony, the reception, you spilling champagne on your jacket.‚Äù Her eyes turned from cheerful recollection to a lustful desire. ‚ÄúBut more than anything, I remember our first night together."" She reached her hand towards my groin and began to unzip my pants. I thrashed away on instinct, causing the chair to scoot away from her advances. She looked at me, puzzled. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, my love? Haven‚Äôt you missed me?‚Äù She approached and opened his mouth once again so that I could speak. ‚ÄúMaggie. I‚Äôm not him,‚Äù I croaked. ‚ÄúPlease. Listen to me. My name is Richard. I‚Äôm an electrician. You hired me to fix your lights, remember?‚Äù She went silent. For a second, I thought I‚Äôd reached her. Her expression softened, and her hand began to tremble. Before I could get another word out, she grabbed an old screwdriver from the cart and drove it deep into my thigh. Blood began pouring from the edges of the wound. I tried to howl out in pain, but the air had been knocked from my lungs. She pulled the screwdriver from my leg and began to slam it in and out repeatedly, all while screaming at the top of her lungs. ‚ÄúNO, NO, NO! This is all wrong! You were chosen! Why hasn‚Äôt he taken control yet?‚Äù I closed my eyes and clenched my teeth, praying that she would either stop hurting me or finish the job already and end my suffering.

She left the tool buried in my leg as she stepped away from me. ‚ÄúMaybe‚Ä¶ maybe he just needs more time. That‚Äôs it. Just a few more days and things will be right as rain again.‚Äù She walked towards what I assumed to be the exit and flipped a light switch. The room became flooded with light, unveiling the very last thing I had expected. The room was much nicer than I had anticipated. There was a small sofa in front of a television in the corner. There was a dining area along with a fridge and dishwasher. There were pets, a few cats and an older Labrador Retriever, scattered around the room. Each of them were frozen in time, stuck in a playful pose. But most confusingly of all, there was a small boy standing near the television. One that refused to budge or blink or breathe. He was a mannequin, the kind you would see in a young teen‚Äôs clothing section. ‚ÄúSee?‚Äù she said, gesturing with open arms. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not so bad. You‚Äôll be comfortable here until‚Ä¶ well, until he fully comes back.‚Äù She paused, nodding to herself as if reassuring her own delusion. I didn‚Äôt respond. I couldn‚Äôt. The pain was eating through my leg like acid. I was spiraling, my thoughts slowly becoming white noise. Despite this, some part of me clung to the idea that escape was still possible. I hadn‚Äôt bled out yet. She hadn‚Äôt hit an artery, and that meant there was still time.

Maggie wandered to the fridge and pulled out a bottle of wine. She poured herself a glass and took a long sip before turning back to me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look at me like that,‚Äù she scolded.  ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt easy for me either. You think I want to hurt you? You think I like seeing you like this? I hate it.‚Äù Her voice cracked, and she slumped back into the armchair across from me, her glass shaking in her hand. ‚ÄúFor years I prayed, every single night, for God to give me a sign. A sign that the voices I heard weren‚Äôt delusion, that my Anthony was still here with me. And then‚Ä¶ you showed up. You had his hands. His eyes. His smile.‚Äù Her eyes were wet now, glistening. ‚ÄúYou were that sign. Anthony told me so.‚Äù I nodded along as I racked my brain over how I was going to get out of this mess. ‚ÄúMaggie,‚Äù I rasped, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you lost him, I really am, but I am not Anthony. I‚Äôm Richard. I have a wife. Her name is Grace. She‚Äôs probably worried sick about me.‚Äù She flinched at Grace‚Äôs name like it burned her. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt matter now,‚Äù Maggie said, her voice low and gravelly. ‚ÄúWhen he returns, we‚Äôre going to pick up from when he left us.‚Äù She gestured to the mannequin. ‚ÄúThe three of us are going to be a family again.‚Äù She stood back up from her seat and made her way towards the stairs. Stairs that assumedly led back into the home. My only ticket out of here. If she were to leave now, there‚Äôs no telling when she would return. Judging by how badly I was bleeding, I certainly wouldn‚Äôt survive for more than a few hours. This was my only chance at escape, and I still hadn‚Äôt thought up a decent game plan. It was now or never. It was time for some improv. 

‚ÄúM- Maggie, my darling, is it really you?‚Äù She had made it halfway up the stairs before stopping dead in her tracks. She slowly turned and began walking towards me. She had a look on her face, one of cautious optimism. I looked down at my constraints. ‚ÄúWhy am I tied to this chair? Did Richard give you this much trouble?‚Äù She practically tackled me at this point, all while squeezing me in her embrace. ‚ÄúI knew it! I knew you would come back to me! Oh, Anthony, how I‚Äôve missed you!‚Äù I was shocked that this was going as smoothly as it was, I half expected my improvisation skills, or lack thereof,  would be the death of me. She pulled a keyring from the rolling cart and began studying them one by one. There must have been at least thirty keys and they all looked nearly identical. She fumbled with the keys, her hands trembling with excitement, or madness. Maybe it was both. My heart pounded in my chest. Every second she spent sorting through those keys was another ounce of blood gone, another inch closer to the edge. ‚ÄúHold still, Anthony,‚Äù Maggie whispered, her breath hot on my face as she bent to unlock the restraints. Click. The first cuff around my left wrist snapped open. A wave of pins and needles shot up my arm, but I didn‚Äôt let it show. I just smiled at her. Click. My other hand had been freed. She turned her attention now to my leg bindings. She crouched down to untie them, and that‚Äôs when I saw it. The screwdriver, still lodged into my thigh, was just a few inches from her face. I knew I‚Äôd only get one shot at this, and it had to be perfect. 

I could feel the pressure on my legs loosen as she tossed the bindings to the floor. ‚ÄúThere we are,‚Äù she said joyously. She gestured for the mannequin to come over to us. ‚ÄúJason! Dad‚Äôs home! He‚Äôs really home!‚Äù She turned her attention back towards me. ‚ÄúHe really has missed his father.‚Äù I forced a smile and reached down slowly, shakily, cradling her cheek in my palm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed him too,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed you both.‚Äù She leaned into my hand, closing her eyes. That‚Äôs when I yanked the screwdriver from my leg with a ragged cry, ignoring the burst of red that followed. Before she could react, I plunged it into her shoulder. The sound she made was awful. It was a mix of surprise and betrayal. Her hands flew to the wound as she stumbled back, knocking into the rolling cart and sending a tray of tools clattering across the floor. I didn‚Äôt wait to see what came next. My adrenaline was surging now, giving me just enough strength to stumble my way toward the stairs. Every movement sent a searing pain through my leg, but I didn‚Äôt stop. I tripped on the third step and began crawling my way to freedom. Behind me, Maggie gurgled, ‚Äúyou‚Ä¶ bastard‚Ä¶‚Äù I began to crawl even faster. I scrambled my way back inside the home and slammed the door behind me. I wasn‚Äôt sure if she had been chasing me or not, and frankly I was too scared to find out. I was just relieved to see a familiar place. I had emerged from the room at the end of the hallway. 

The hallway was dimly lit, just as I remembered it, but now it felt smaller, more claustrophobic. I pressed my back against the door, holding it shut with what little strength I had left. My thigh throbbed like it had a heartbeat of its own, the screwdriver wound pouring warmth into the dress pants she had adorned me with. I began to tear away at my fleshy veil, hoping that by removing it I could catch my breath a little easier. After a few seconds I could feel the stitching along the back begin to tear. The mask fell to the floor in a nauseating wet clump. I had never been so happy to smell musty air in my entire life. This victory would have to be short lived. I knew I would need to make it to the front door if I wanted to make it out of here, but that would be easier said than done.  I limped down the hall, dragging my injured leg behind me like a dead weight. I had no idea how much time I had before Maggie recovered, and if she did‚Ä¶ if she came after me again‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt so sure I had any more luck left to spare. The living room was just around the corner, if I could make it there and find a phone, maybe I could call Grace or Cheryl or the police. Maybe there was a way out of this. I pushed into the room and nearly collapsed against the nearest wall. There, just a few feet outside my grasp, was a rotary phone on a nearby end table. Salvation was all but secured. 

I struggled for a moment trying to remember how to even use one of these damned things. Nine. One. One. The phone began to ring. ‚ÄúElkins Police Department, what‚Äôs the exact location of your emergency?‚Äù My mind was all over the place, I wasn‚Äôt sure where to even begin. Would she even believe my story or just chalk it up to some crackhead calling? ‚ÄúHello? Is anyone there?‚Äù I blurted out, ‚Äúyes! I‚Äôm here, please don‚Äôt hang up!‚Äù She began again, ‚ÄúWhere are you located sir?‚Äù Oh god, the address. I racked my brain to remember off the top of my head, but nothing sounded correct. Then I heard it. A creaking from down the hall followed by slow, deliberate footsteps. I held the phone close and began to whisper to the operator. ‚ÄúPlease, you need to help me. This psycho is going to kill me unless you get here soon.‚Äù I could hear her inching ever closer from down the hall. Then, her footsteps stopped. It had gone quiet before Maggie‚Äôs wailing exploded throughout the home. I decided to use this momentary distraction to create some more distance between the two of us. I dropped the phone and ran into the foyer. I knew trying to escape through the front door was no longer an option. I knew that she would be able to outpace me with my bum leg, and with how long that entryway stretched on for, it was off the table. I would just need to hide somewhere and hope that the police could somehow trace my call back to here. It wasn‚Äôt much of a plan, but it‚Äôs all I had. 

She was once again on the move, her thundering footsteps echoed through my ears. ‚ÄúAnthony was wrong about you Richard! You‚Äôre not a good man! You‚Äôre a liar, a coward, a filthy rat! And I‚Äôm going to put you down like the sneaky little rodent you are!‚Äù I knew I didn‚Äôt have much longer until she found me. My eyes bounced around the room trying to find a decent spot to slink away to. There was only one option that had any potential, and I wasn‚Äôt a fan. Anthony‚Äôs headless body had been stood up and placed back into his corner. His legs would be just wide enough to obscure me from her immediate detection. I squirmed my way behind him and cupped a hand over my mouth to try and conceal my heavy, anxious breathing. She suddenly stumbled into view, her eyes surveying the area. I could faintly see the screwdriver still entrenched deep into her shoulder. The crazed look on her face told me this was no longer a mentally disturbed old woman, but a predator hunting its prey. In one hand she held out the unfurled face of a former lover, in the other she carried the same double barrel shotgun she had previously threatened Cheryl with. She began to speak once again, but not to me. ‚ÄúWhere is he? Do you see him?‚Äù She held the face out in front of her as it scanned from one end of the room to the other. She had begun to turn away when something caught her attention. Something on the floorboards in front of her. I hadn‚Äôt thought about how bad I was bleeding, but if I knew I would be leaving a sticky, red breadcrumb trail for her to follow I wouldn‚Äôt have even bothered hiding. Her eyes drifted upwards until they reached my hiding spot. This was it, this was how it ends. 

There was no gasp of surprise. No shouts of rage. Only the twisted grin of a cat that had cornered its mouse. ‚ÄúThere you are,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúHiding like a little boy behind Daddy‚Äôs legs.‚Äù She began to approach, step by step, the shotgun swaying gently at her side. ‚ÄúMaggie, please you don‚Äôt have to do this.‚Äù My pleas fell on deaf ears. ‚ÄúThis could have all been avoided, Richard. If you had only given my Anthony his second chance at life none of this would have happened to you.‚Äù She approached closer still, the smile quickly leaving her face. ‚ÄúHe was a very generous man. I‚Äôm sure after a few years he would have given you your body back.‚Äù She pointed the gun forward. I could do nothing but shrink further into my corner. ‚ÄúBut you‚Ä¶ you were selfish! You never cared about me or him, only yourself! And now, even after all the harm you‚Äôve caused us, you have the gall to hide behind him like a coward. Like a weasel. And there‚Äôs nothing worse than a goddamn weas‚Ä¶‚Äù CRACK! A deafening snap rang out, not that of a gunshot but of fractured bone. Maggie had tripped. Anthony‚Äôs loafers remained in the walkway from Cheryl‚Äôs visit and Maggie must have forgotten about them. Her foot had caught on the corner of one and completely shattered her ankle. She stumbled forward, arms flailing. The shotgun slipped from her hand and clattered across the hardwood. And then, SHLUNK. The exposed metal rod jutting out of Anthony‚Äôs neck, right where the taxidermist had mounted the head, met her throat with surgical precision. It skewered clean through. For a moment, she didn‚Äôt even seem to realize it had happened. Her body landed hard against Anthony‚Äôs, propping her upright, almost in an embrace. Blood began to pool in the collarbone crevice of the mannequin, trickling down his chest and spattering onto the floorboards like rain. The face-mask slipped from her fingers and landed near my feet, its mouth agape in a frozen, empty smile.

Maggie tried to speak, but only a wet, gurgling hiss came out. Her eyes searched mine, wide and confused. Then something in her gaze softened. Her arms relaxed. She was gone. The room fell silent. I stayed crouched behind Anthony, shaking. It was over, or at least I hoped it was. I wasn‚Äôt sure how long I stayed like that, it could have been a couple of minutes or a couple of hours. Eventually, I heard a voice from the hallway. ‚ÄúElkins PD! Let me see those hands!‚Äù Flashlights cut through the darkness. Three officers had walked into the foyer, firearms drawn. I didn‚Äôt want to be placed in handcuffs again but knew I had no choice in the matter. I explained to one of the officers what had happened as the other two investigated the basement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so glad you were able to trace my call to here,‚Äù I sighed. ‚ÄúHonestly doubt I can even stand up on my own at this point, much less drive myself to the hospital.‚Äù The officer looked at me, confused. ‚ÄúWe weren‚Äôt responding to a call from you, we were asked to do a wellness check for‚Ä¶ well, that one over there.‚Äù He gestured toward Mrs. Calhoun. ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôve got to be the one to break the bad news to her son.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt take long for my story to add up, I was living proof of what had happened here. I was promptly removed from cuffs and placed on a stretcher for my wounds. As they wheeled me out of that house, I looked back inside one last time. Anthony stood as still as ever. And Maggie, hanging limp from his body, finally looked like she belonged there. Like she had become part of the macabre shrine she‚Äôd spent the latter part of her life building. 

There was an ambulance parked in front of the house. The paramedics loaded me inside, their voices hushed but urgent as they worked to stabilize my blood loss. I remember the faint smell of antiseptic, the sharp sting of a needle in my arm, the soft static of the radio crackling something about ‚Äúunresponsive female at the scene.‚Äù I was able to see one of the officers speaking with a middle-aged man on the front porch. He didn‚Äôt appear to be a first responder, he wasn‚Äôt wearing a uniform or badge of any kind. The two of them finished their conversation when the mystery man turned his attention to me. He approached the vehicle and climbed in through the open doors. ‚ÄúYou must be Richard.‚Äù I winced as the paramedics finished applying a tourniquet to my leg. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what my parents told me.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt aware of who was standing in front of me, but I recognized his face somewhere in the recesses of my mind. He looked to the men hovering over me. ‚ÄúWould I be able to speak with my friend here for a moment?‚Äù They seemed unsure at first but agreed begrudgingly. ‚ÄúFine but make it quick. He‚Äôs going to need stitches if he wants the bleeding to stop for good.‚Äù The man nodded and the paramedics stepped away for a smoke break. He turned back to me. ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Jason, sounds like you had a bit of a run in with my mom.‚Äù My heart skipped a beat. I wanted to be apologetic, after all I had just gotten his mom killed, but I was unable to ask for forgiveness. He beat me to the punch. 

‚ÄúListen, I‚Äôm sorry you got dragged into the middle of my family‚Äôs craziness. My mom hasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ she wasn‚Äôt herself for a long time. Did she‚Ä¶ oh God, she showed you dad didn‚Äôt she?‚Äù I was afraid to bring up the topic, unsure of whether he had seen his childhood idol recently. ‚ÄúShe did, yeah.‚Äù He sat down on the bench next to me. ‚ÄúBelieve it or not, the whole thing with dad was my idea. I figured it would help her move past her grief seeing him every day. To be honest, seeing him like that, in a weird way, helped me to move on as well. But I never meant for things to go as far as they did. I can‚Äôt excuse the things she did to you, but I can say I‚Äôm sorry for what happened here tonight.‚Äù He held out a hand, one that I reluctantly shook. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault, Jason. I just wish things could have ended differently with Maggie.‚Äù He let out a heavy sigh. ‚ÄúYou and me both.‚Äù He stood from his seat and departed from the ambulance. Shortly after, I was raced to the Elkins Emergency Center for surgery. Upon shaking off the anesthesia, I awoke to find my clothes and cellphone had been retrieved from the crime scene and placed neatly on a neighboring stool. I retrieved my phone to see what time it was. There were seventeen notifications on the screen, all missed calls and text messages from Grace. 

I wish I could say we lived happily ever after, but that would be far from the truth. Grace filed for a divorce upon realizing that I lied to her about everything involving the Calhoun residence. Even worse, my career went down the drain shortly after. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do any electrical work, not when the thought of Anthony or Maggie looming in every dark corner filled my head. There were dozens of missed appointments, hundreds of negative reviews, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to care. Not after what had happened to me because of that damned job. I‚Äôm writing this all out for my therapist, he tells me that getting the story on paper should help to process some of these traumas I‚Äôve held onto for so long. Up until this point he was correct to an extent, but something happened this morning that brought it all rushing back. It‚Äôs Christmas today, the first I‚Äôve ever spent alone. I went about my usual morning routines before stumbling upon a letter someone had slid through the mail slot of my front door. It had no return address, the front reading, ‚ÄúTo Richard the Electrician.‚Äù I was positive that it was another letter from a disgruntled ex-client of mine, but it wasn‚Äôt. It was a Christmas card, the generic ones that say something like ‚ÄúSeasons Greetings‚Äù on the cover. Upon opening the card, I could feel my knees getting weaker. It was a card from a local business, its name reading Calhoun Taxidermy. There was an attached photo, one with three people in frame. Jason, Anthony and Maggie all huddled together for a family picture. I peered closer. There were now two pairs of dull marbles staring back at me. Not just the one.

I keep trying to be to remind myself that it takes longer than 6 weeks for things to be ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù, but at times I have myself convinced that the pains I feel are me dying. The first few weeks pp of bad anxiety has now led to severe health anxiety, and every little pain has me convinced I‚Äôm dying of cancer and I won‚Äôt get to see my baby grow up. It‚Äôs overwhelming. I‚Äôm trying to remind myself that my body just went through something insane and my insides can be messed up for a long time and that I‚Äôm fine but then I feel like Im just lying to myself. I was starting to do good, then this started and I feel like I‚Äôve fallen into a rabbit hole I can‚Äôt get out of.

1mg7th1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1mg7th1/one_of_my_scariest_dreams/,One of my scariest dreams,"For as long as I can remember, I've always been plagued by bad dreams/nightmares. The night of my dream: I had left the ashtray, a bag of chips, a drink, and cigarettes on the coffee table in the living room. I fell asleep in my bedroom, but it felt like I wasn't sleeping at all, as it was still the same night. I heard something in the living room. I walked there. Everything was very dark, and someone was sitting on my couch. My couch is quite large (U-shaped), and she was sitting all the way on the other side from where I was standing. She was smoking a cigarette, and I could feel her looking at me.
I turned on a small lamp in the living room. Then I saw that it was my grandmother, who passed away in 2001. So I said, ""Hi Grandma, are you back?"" I didn't dare to say she was dead. My grandmother looked at me and said, ""Yes, I'm back. I want to tell you something."" She was silent for a moment and then said, ""They're looking for you, and they're almost here."" I thought my own grandmother was threatening me. So I asked, ""Who's looking for me? And where are they?""
She repeated, ""They're almost here."" A detail here: I had also sat down on the couch, and from my spot, I could see the hallway and the front door. I asked Grandma again, ""Where are they?"" That's when she said, ""They're here."" At that moment, someone knocked on the door, and it opened. I saw several people come in, but I couldn't see who they were. The first person walked very quickly toward me through the hallway but didn't say anything. After that I woke up, It was very scary, i went to my living room and saw the ashtray, cigarettes, bag of chips and my drink at the same spot as last night or my dream.

Normally, I would accept defeat and decide ‚Äúwell I guess pothos aren‚Äôt the plant for me‚Äù (this used to be all plants so it could be worse, right?), yet I fell in love with the beauty of this one and *had* to have it. 
As you can see, I practically tortured this once vibrant, beautiful plant. I turned to this sub for advice - realizing my plethora of mistakes I took a big risk..


I‚Äôve propagated plants before and have had success, how hard could this be? If it dies, I‚Äôll try my luck with a new one from the same shop! 



This particular plant shop I was introduced to over a decade ago with its humble beginnings as a small and unassuming coffee shop. One I‚Äôd never heard of, but had discovered on a walk at the same time I was discovering just how good jazz really is. A hidden gem that became my refuge - I became familiar with the owner and  faces of the patrons (the kind of people I thought I would never see in a Starbucks - this pleased my angsty teenage brain).



Eventually, the coffee shop moved further away and I never really made enough time to go. The coffee shop closed its doors.. moved to a new location, and became a plant shop! (still selling bags of those delicious coffee beans I‚Äôd loved)
As luck would have it - I was within walking distance when I discovered this new development. I had also developed the ability to keep *some* plants alive! 



I brought this beautiful plant home from this wonderful owner of this amazing shop I‚Äôd grown up with throughout all of its changes.. and almost completely murdered the poor thing. My problem and the whole point of this post? 


The plant shop is moving to another state several hours away from me. And while the propagations have shown beautiful growth .. I‚Äôm scared I may strike again üò≠ I don‚Äôt want to be held liable for murder for killing the only plant from the shop that I grew up with and love dearly! Okay.. maybe I‚Äôm a bit attached.. and so I beg of you, showing you my vulnerability in these photos - help me keep my babies alive !!


TL;DR (so fair): I have an emotional attachment to a plant that almost died and need help keeping her alive ",2,1754186846.0,pothos,0,1.0,False

What if the reason the dinosaurs in *Jurassic Park* were so aggressive wasn‚Äôt because they were inherently violent apex predators‚Ä¶ but because InGen genetically engineered them *without feathers*?

**Hear me out...**

So I had a thought, and now I can‚Äôt stop laughing at the idea because it *actually makes sense* the more I think about it.

What if the reason the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park were so damn aggressive wasn‚Äôt because they were ‚Äúgenetically engineered apex predators‚Äù or whatever Dr. Wu said.... but because they were cold, bald, and PISSED?



**Like think about it...**

The real-life science now says a ton of theropods, raptors, T. rex, etc... likely had *feathers*. Not full-on Big Bird fluff, but definitely enough for insulation. Nature gave them a nice warm murder coat.  
But InGen was like ‚ÄúNah, give 'em frog DNA and make 'em slick, scaly, naked bastards.‚Äù

So now you‚Äôve got these semi-warm-blooded, artificially bred dinos, probably *mesothermic*, meaning their body temp regulation isn‚Äôt great on its own, just dumped into this fake jungle zoo during thunderstorms and chaos. No feathers. No sunlamps. Just wet rocks and rain and confused tourists.

Like, I don‚Äôt think they were inherently evil....

They were just *freezing* and confused, like ‚Äúwhy the fuck am I awake after 65 million years?? Where the fuck are my feathers?? Why does my blood feel like iced coffee?? WHO IS THIS MAN IN SHORTS SCREAMING NEAR MY ENCLOSURE???‚Äù

The raptors especially. Tiny arms. Featherless. Constantly flexing. Probably shivering.  
No wonder they were so stabby...

And don‚Äôt even get me started on T. rex. That poor girl was probably just trying to walk off the cold-induced muscle spasms, and everyone‚Äôs screaming while she‚Äôs stretching her calves in the rain...

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Ok, wait, has anyone else fallen down the rabbit hole of AI gift cards?! Because I just did, and‚ÄîWOW, I have questions and like ‚ú®95 tidbits of excitement all jumbled together.

So, imagine this: It's someone‚Äôs birthday, or a maybe-I‚Äôm-sorry-for-eating-your-last-slice-of-pizza day, and instead of that generic Amazon or Starbucks card, you send them‚Ä¶ an AI-powered gift. Not just a gift card, but access into the world of artificial intelligence, tailored recommendations, maybe even creations!

Here are some possibilities I can‚Äôt get out of my mind:

- What if you send an AI gift card and the person can choose to spend it on personalized stories, art generated just for them, or even help with their side projects?  
- Could they ask the AI for helpful advice, or use the card to unlock their own pocket-sized digital consultant?  
- Will we live to see an era where our loved ones get one-of-a-kind books written FOR them by AI birthday-wishes-bots??  
- Or imagine gifting access to endlessly clever books‚Äîlike the massive collection at https://goodnovel.org/  
  (Seriously. Go. Scroll. Tell me you aren‚Äôt tempted.)

OKAY, BUT‚Äîam I the only one who feels low-key confused by the potential limits here? ü§î

- How secure would it be?  
- Will people accidentally end up gifting ‚ÄúAI hours‚Äù and the recipient uses it up talking to a virtual boyfriend? üòÇ  
- What even is the currency for this? Tokens? Time? Potato bytes??
- Is it kinda like handing someone a key to a library where the books WRITE THEMSELVES? The mind boggles.

Someone, HELP ME OUT‚Äîdoes this mean we could give an AI gift card to our friend who‚Äôs obsessed with reading, and she can basically request the robot to write her fanfiction, right then and there? Like, ‚ÄúHey AI, write me a love story about a billionaire vampire and a coffee-addicted mermaid.‚Äù ??? Then‚Ä¶ BOOM. Whole series for her. (And me, popcorn at the ready. üòÇ) Is this the next step after gift cards for streaming services??

Check out https://goodnovel.org/ if you want your brainstorming to absolutely explode.

But also, doesn‚Äôt this make gift-giving a little riskier? What if I give my grandma an AI gift card and suddenly her phone turns into HAL9000? There‚Äôs something both deeply thrilling and moderately terrifying about trusting a futuristic robot with your birthday message‚Ä¶

Let‚Äôs bullet point the THRILLS and the ‚ÄúWAIT, WHAT‚Äù moments:

- You could give the gift of literal, endless creativity!
- Maybe less landfill plastic wrapping?? That deserves a cheer.
- But ALSO‚Äîthe unknown! I do not want to be liable for accidental AI romance-gone-wrong shows. 

Last thing: if this somehow means more time spent on https://goodnovel.org/, getting fresh, custom stories to devour, I am a thousand percent IN. Please give me my jetpack and virtual library card, thanks. 

Has anybody actually seen an AI gift card ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù? What would you wish for if someone gave you one? Would you be excited, or creeped out?
