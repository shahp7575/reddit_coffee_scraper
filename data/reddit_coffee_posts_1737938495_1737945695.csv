For background- I’m the mom and I am just not a morning person. No matter what I do, I just do not thrive in the morning 😂 usually I let my little one watch tv (Ms.Rachel) for 45 mins while I wake up and have some coffee. However, I want to cut down on her TV time! Any activities that your little one enjoys before having breakfast? I am looking to fill about an hour. I’m okay with also receiving the comment of “just playing with toys”! I won’t be offended lol any other non morning people that just really don’t want to get out of bed in the morning? Thanks!!!!

1iaxk8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/originalloquat/comments/1iaxk8g/the_dinner_party_short_story_4100_words/,The Dinner Party (Short Story) (4100 words),"I rubbed my eyes and lit a cigarette. 



‘I thought you were quitting,’ Emma said, sauntering from the unmade bed into the kitchen. She wore a white vest and no bra. 



‘I will when things… calm down.’ 



She smiled coyly. ‘Did you phone BT?’ 



‘I will. I will.’



‘You know, I always thought when people said they weren’t morning people, it was just an expression- but wow, you really aren't a morning person.’ 



I stopped myself from snapping back. It’s what my Dad would’ve done, and then there was talk of divorce with my Mam before the cornflakes had been poured. 



‘I just, I just,’ I stuttered, watching the cigarette burn down like a fuse. ‘Why can’t they just shut the fuck up?’ 



‘Wear earplugs like me.’ 



‘I can hear my heartbeat when I’m trying to sleep.’ 



Once again, she smiled that smile. It was the same smile she wore in the picture on the fridge of her as a kid– the one her Mam had taken when she’d just caught her drawing on the wall. 



‘I’ll get you a coffee, babe.’ 



‘It won’t even make a dent.’ 



I went back to my copy of the Great Gatsby– the screen of my laptop open- **1. The notion of the American dream figures preeminently in this story. How should readers define the American dream?** 



With my sleep-deprived brain, reading the book had been like learning to meditate. Five seconds of concentration until unrelated thoughts rammed into my head like train cars.  



So we beat on, boats against the current, born back into *fucking. Why do they spend all night fucking?*



Beside me was a Matthew Walker book on sleep, and I sulkily chucked it across the couch. How could you get into a good circadian rhythm when the neighbours were shagging so loudly every night? 12, 1, 2, fucking so raucously that every morning I had to readjust my Matisse print on the connecting wall. 



‘If it bothers you so much, why don’t you say something?’ Emma continued, putting my mug on the table. My Mam had bought it when we started our second year at university and moved in together. It said student+dying= studying. 



‘Because I’m English,’ I replied. ‘Engish people don’t complain.’ 



‘That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard.’ 



‘I’m just kidding.’ 



But it was only half true. I was terribly shy and, on top of that, anxious- still a kid, really. 



Emma laughed when we signed the contract for the apartment. The landlord, Dan, had shown us around, and when we shook hands, I’d said: ‘Thanks for helping us out, Dad.’ 



‘Fresh air,’ She continued. 



She went to the window and cracked it open. It was a beautiful city centre view looking out over Newcastle quayside. We couldn’t really afford it, but then, because of my degree, I was already in £40,000 worth of debt, so what was another five? 



She came back over, and the chill wind of the Tyne outside hardened her nipples. She caught me looking and laughed. 



‘Well, I haven’t made the bed yet? We might as well go back to it.’ 



For all my various hangups and neuroses, I was lucky that my sexual life hadn’t been too badly affected. I took her by the hand, knowing at least the next 30 minutes would be ok. 



… 



Sometimes, I’d even question if I was sexually attracted to Emma. I mean, I was obviously because we had sex 3 or 4 times a week, but the much stronger feeling was a kind of entrancement. 



Most of the time, I’d just watch Emma- how she moved. I’d focus intently on her collar bones, neckline, or the backs of her knees where those lines that formed an uppercase H came to life. 



She was lying on my chest as I stroked her head, and I got lost in a trance, counting the black hairs flowing out the centre parting on the top of her head. 



‘How can people be like that?’ I said, staring up at the white ceiling. ‘Making so much noise when they’re fucking… It's gratuitous. Like porn.’ 



Emma drifted back from sleep. ‘Are we still on about this? Just say something to them.’



‘And the crescendo when she orgasms. It sounds like one of those animals dying on *nature is metal*.’ 



‘Well, they say some women can’t control the noises they make when they cum.’ 



I felt her stiffen almost imperceptibly, and I wouldn’t have felt it at all if she hadn’t been splayed out all over me.’ 



‘But you, you don’t lose your mind like that.’ 



‘No, true.’ 



And then it hit me. 



The well-rested mind is good at suppressing all those things that might overwhelm you. 



‘Why don't you make those noises?’ I continued. 



‘Like you say, it's over the top.’ 



I propped myself up against the headboard, and Matisse shook again. 



‘Wait,’ I said, ‘you do orgasm when we have sex, don’t you?’ 



‘Yes, of course I do.’ 



But I couldn’t let it go.



‘Look at me, Em. You do cum, don’t you?’ 



I knew. I fucking knew. 



‘Jesus Christ. I can’t believe this. You’re telling me we’ve been together one year, and I never made you cum once.’ 



‘I didn’t say that.’ 



But her eyes flicked down and to the left, and I knew just as sure as I loved her that it was true. 



‘Fucking hell.’ 



I jumped up from the bed. 



‘This whole 12 months has been a lie.’ 



She was still affecting a look of indifference, and then she collapsed under the weight of my accusations. 



‘Look, it's not a big deal. I mean, I never have, with anyone.’ 



But by this point, I was completely swept away by hysteria. 



‘Anyone, so I’m just anyone? I’m the same as Spacker John, who put his fingers up your skirt at Digital.’ 



‘Please, just calm down and come back to bed.’ 



I thrust my right leg into the left leg of my jeans and nearly tipped over. 



‘It's all been bullshit.’ I repeated. ‘12 months. How many times is that? 100? And every time you’ve been faking it?’ 



‘No, no. You know how much I love it. I just... have never been able to.’ 



There was such a swirling torrent of emotions inside of me. Anger at being lied to, but shame more than anything. What kind of man couldn’t make his girlfriend cum– worse– didn’t even know his girlfriend wasn’t cumming? I was one of those 1950s husbands who put out all the lights, politely rutted for 2 minutes, as his wife fantasized about the milkman. 



‘Where are you going?’ 



‘Out! Out of this house of lies.’ 



She tried not to smile at the melodrama of it all, and this was enough to really send me over the edge. I threw on a jacket and slammed the front door behind me. 



…



I spent the day in a coffee shop, wishing for the end of the world. 



Then, around 5, I returned home, and the first burning embers of guilt began to flare up. I wasn’t a psychologist, but I knew that if a woman tells you she can’t cum, making a massive deal about it is probably the last thing you should do. 



‘Em, look, I’m sorry. I just wish you’d told me. We can’t be like one of those couples who never talk.’ 



She kissed my eyelids. ‘I know, I know. It just never bothered me, that’s all.’ 



Somewhere deep down, I could still feel that raging torrent, but now wasn’t the time to address it. You shouldn’t attempt to defuse an IED when you’re already feeling blown through with other holes. 



‘I talked to Natalie,’ she continued. 



I slumped down on the couch, turning over some fresher problem that had crept into my mind. 



‘Natalie,’ she repeated as I stared off into space. 



‘Aye, that lass from Danserxise?’ 



‘No, Natalie, we met in the lift. She's the woman from next door.’ 



‘Wait. What? You mean the screamer?’ 



‘She was taking their bulldog out. We got chatting. I tell you, she’s like a movie star.’ 



‘We are talking about the porn actress that keeps me up all night here, aren’t we?’

 

‘She’s not a porn actress. In fact, she’s a dropshipper– whatever that is– and I’ve invited her and her husband around for dinner tonight.’ 



‘Woah, woah, woah, you’ve invited them around. How am I gonna…’



‘After I’ve served the first course, you can ask them to stop shagging.’ 



‘Em, Em, what the fuck, Em?’ I was back on my feet.



‘I’m kidding. I’m kidding. But you know, when they realize that they’re living next door to someone- it’s not just an empty room– it might help.’ 



‘Well, it looks like I don’t have a fucking choice, does it?’ 



It could have escalated into an argument, but it rarely did with Emma. Arguing with her was like shouting at a mill pond. Nothing much affected her, and you’d end up feeling daft. 



…



It's strange to meet someone for the first time when you’ve already heard them in the throes of ecstasy. It spoke to something in my personality that I felt a little guilty. 



Natalie, from next door, didn’t look like I imagined when she started endangering the structural integrity of the building at 2 am. 



I thought she’d be a student like us, with pink hair and lip piercings. Instead, she was clutching a bottle of expensive red wine and dressed like Kate Middleton– classy and reserved– with an air of confidence that didn’t come from what she’d read in the First Year, but an entire life of social clout– stretching back centuries and centuries to some ancient seat of power deep in the Northumbrian countryside. 



I was instantly intimidated. You could have all this sparkling wit and philosophy about Camus, but whatever confidence she held was older than existentialism– it was older than England. 



Who was I? The first in my family to go to university. If I went home, I’d sit at home silently while my parents watched Michael Mcintyre's The Wheel in an old council house. Her family was the Wheel, turning society generation after generation. 



Emma, as always, was serene and welcomed them like old friends. 



Natalie took me by the hand and leaned in for a kiss, and I awkwardly brushed her cheek, fretting I’d scratched her porcelain skin with my stubble.



I was so busy worrying about how to greet her that I didn't even consider her husband behind until he smiled at me. 



Sometimes in life, you meet these people who seem to have leaped from a work of art. I was in a Starbucks once in Utrecht, and this girl poured me an ice water, and I could’ve sworn she was the same girl from that Vermeer painting. The only difference was that instead of a pearl earring, she wore AirPods. 



Nicholas looked at me, and it was the same smile from the Great Gatsby. *He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor.* 



‘Great to meet you,’ he said. ‘It's really great. 



I stood there like a mannequin and thank god for Emma, who invited them in properly and poured them each a glass of our Tesco wine. 



‘Well,’ he continued, ‘I might just have to have a word with Mr. Dan Armitage because your apartment has a much better view than ours.’ 



The other two laughed merrily, and then I did, slightly delayed because my brain was working slower. 



‘We’re students,’ Emma replied, deftly. ‘He probably gets a tax break to have at least one student couple in the building.’ 



Already I needed a rest. I took an inordinate amount of time at the fridge selecting a beer. It was rammed full of Stella. Could I drink Stella at a dinner party? My saving grace was some real Belgian beer we’d picked up at the airport on the way back from Holland. Somewhat ominously, it was called La Guillotine, but the bottle was highly presentable. 



‘Now is the time someone less witty would make a joke about you liking a strong blonde.’ Nicholas said, pointing at the bottle. ‘It’s a nice drop, is it, pal?’ 



Again I thought of Gatsby. Was *pal* his *old sport*? 



Emma led them over to the small table where our somewhat limited dining set had been laid out.  



They were dressed well, not fabulously (as I was tempted to write) because fabulously connotes a kind of extravagance. 



The right kind of rich people no longer dress ostentatiously. Sometime in the 1960s, it became bad form… Poor people copied the rich of the past, and the rich went minimalist. 



He wore an eggshell blue polo that matched his eyes, cream chinos, and brown shoes. His silver watch had a slim wristband and was an Italian brand I’d never heard of. His wedding ring was simple gold. He had elegant fingers, the pink parts of the nail walls well defined, and his arms were muscular and brown. 



‘So what do you do, Nicholas?’ Emma said. 



‘I’m a gym owner.’ 



That was the last thing I expected him to say. 



‘Really, I go to the one on Clayton Street, just signed up.’ 



‘I wish I’d known; I would’ve given you a free membership at one of ours. I hate to think your landlord is more generous than your neighbour.’ 



Emma smiled, clearly charmed. I would’ve thought he was a bastard if I wasn’t similarly taken by him. 



‘Where is your gym?’ She continued. 



‘Well, there’s one at St James and one in Carliol Square.’ 



‘Oh right, it's a chain. I know it, the one with the glove and the peace symbol? I saw them in Edinburgh too when we went up for the weekend. Do you remember?’ 



She turned to me as I drank La Guillotine like medicine.



I flinched at being included in the conversation, and a little beer ran down my chin. Befitting their station, the couple pretended not to notice.  



‘Yes, we have 30 locations around the country. It started in Edinburgh. That’s where I’m from.’ 



He didn’t look like his wife, the young English duchess. He was just as aesthetically appealing, no doubt, but his face was Scottish in a way difficult to describe if you haven’t spent a lot of time there. 



‘It’s just luck,’ he continued, ‘I grew up in the gym- so I got to see what was good and bad before I was even aware of it.’ 



‘You don’t look like a boxer,’ I replied. 



He smiled, all perfect white teeth and slim nose without the slightest trace of a crack in it. 



‘I was a good boxer, I mean better than anyone I fought in Edinburgh, and then when I took a step up in competition, I had enough sense to realize it was only downhill from there.’ He gestured at a stack of books on the table. ‘What is it Orwell says?: *I have the ability to face up to uncomfortable facts.*’ 



What kind of businessman come boxer quoted Orwell?



‘You like Orwell?’ I replied. 



‘No,’ he threw his hands in the air. ‘I can’t claim to be an expert. I don't have any sort of university degree…’ His blue eyes sparkled. ‘I'll let you in on a secret. 90% of the success in your life will be down to generalisability. I can tell you that Ernest Hemingway’s best book is For Whom The Bell Tolls, and I can tell you why, but did I ever read it? No.’ 



All at once, he was completely open yet without leaking the slightest bit of vulnerability. If I took to letting down my defences, I appeared like a suppurating, ugly wound, and people felt no choice but to avert their eyes.



His wife stroked his hand, spinning the wedding ring around his groomed, slender finger. 



For a second, I remembered how much I’d hated them when I heard them late at night. Yet now, I felt admiration bordering on devotion. He could fuck his beautiful wife all night if he wanted.  



‘Of course, you must know the best story of Papa Hemingway,’ he continued, ‘a tour guide in Paris told us… One day, Hemingway and Fitzgerald are drinking in a cafe when Fitzgerald says, “Hem, my wife has been questioning the size of my manhood. She says with a member that size, she will never be satisfied.’""



‘Oh, come on, Nick.’ Natalie cut in. ‘Not this story.’ 



But it was said with no real force, more of a polite nod to us that we had permission to be offended, not that we’d take it.



‘Anyway, Hemingway coolly sips his vermouth and says, “Well, there’s only one way to find out, join me in *le water*.” The two great writers of the 20th century saunter through the restaurant to the toilet, and Fitzgerald takes down his trousers, and Papa Hemingway goes in for a closer look.' 



“Well, Scotty, everything looks proportional to me,"" Hemingway replies. 



“Really? Zelda is just twisting the knife.” 



“Certainly, old chap, and if you have any more concerns, just go down to the Louvre and peruse those Michelangelo statues.” 



Emma lit up, and my joy at seeing it was quickly replaced by a primaeval terror. Was that the problem? Did she need a massive dick? Terror. Sheer terror. The only refuge was La Guillotine. 



Emma served the first course, but I could barely even taste it because I washed it down with so much beer. I needed to reach that equilibrium. My thoughts were stampeding horses. The alcohol corralled them.  



The main course came, and I paid even less attention to it. In fact, I resented it because I could feel the food soaking up the booze.



‘Tell me now about dropshipping.’ Emma said to Natalie. 



‘Oh, that,’ she said, swirling the red wine around the glass. ‘It’s just a hobby.’ 



‘Don’t be modest,’ Nicholas said. ‘Your store is very successful.’ 



‘It doesn’t require much to be successful. It’s all about imitation, really. You browse the web, find a winning design, and then put that design in your online store. It's branding, ultimately.’ 



‘What my lovely wife is omitting is that she has a BA from the London School of Economics.’  



‘But getting into a good university is not much more than good branding as well. You yourself are the brand. I wouldn’t put too much weight behind a good degree…’ She paused. ‘I mean that in the nicest way possible.’ 



‘Yes, but you still need to write the essays,’ Nicholas continued. 



‘Well, the funny thing about that is that you don’t really, not anymore. There was a Chinese girl on my course. The best student in class. And then she stopped coming to lectures. However, it didn’t seem to matter because she continued to receive the top grade. Anyway, one day it came through that this poor girl had been hit by a London city bus and killed, 25; what a tragedy, yet from beyond the grave, she was completely diligent. She never missed a deadline. It emerged that she’d been paying someone an exorbitant amount of money on Upwork to complete every assignment for her, and clearly, her freelancer hadn’t received the news. We brought it up with the course leader, and it didn’t bother him as long as the projects were handed in on time. Cut forward to graduation, and this girl passed with a distinction. Obviously, she was not there to collect it.’ 



It might’ve sounded a little glib, but coming from her mouth, the anecdote seemed utterly charming. 



Dessert was served, and I didn’t even make any pretence of attempting it. La Guillotine ran out; instead, I cracked open a bottle of whiskey. 



Emma took Natalie off to look at her artwork in the bedroom. I was happy now in the warm glow of whiskey and Nicholas’ easy charm. 



I could tell from his accent alone that he’d come from a similar place to myself. With more alcohol, he slid away sometimes into Edinburgh Scottish that his sober brain dampened down. Words like *ken* and *bairn* and *wee yin* slid into his vocabulary. 



I’d hit that equilibrium with the alcohol. The golden zone where I still retained the core element of my personality and felt confident enough that I could at least show a touch of weakness without collapsing in on myself. 



‘Do you mind if I ask you something?’ I said. 



‘Of course, pal.’ 



‘Did you get with a lot of girls when you were younger?’ 



He smiled that smile. 



‘I did well by the standard expected of me.’ 



‘What do you mean expected of you?’ 



‘Well, 15 years ago, in the circles I mixed, it was a badge of honour to sleep with as many girls as possible… It never much appealed to me, but I did it anyway because it was normal.’ 



He ran his hand through his immaculate blonde hair. The smell of aftershave mixed with whiskey drifted over. 



‘There was one moment that made me stop. I met this girl in a bar, and she asked me to go home with her. She had this apartment out in Jesmond, and we did the deed, and that was all good, and then I’m lying in bed after, and she’s walking around all naked and angelic, and I said this is one of the best first dates I ever had. She looked at me, first smiling, and then in anger. She goes. “first date, you don’t remember, do you? We’ve slept together before, six months ago. This is your second time here.”’ he paused, smelling the whiskey. ‘I tell you, I had no recollection of her or her apartment, and I realised then that we’d shared something so personal, and I had no memory of it. What kind of way was that to live? Anyway, a year later, I met Natalie, and we took it slow, and it built and built into the best thing I’ve ever had. Forget the gyms, the watches, all of the accoutrements. I would move into a terrace in Benwell and shovel shite for the rest of my life if only I had her.’ 



I had the vague sense that what he was saying had an element of profundity to it, but my own mind was consumed by base elements of living. 



‘It worked from the very beginning, sexually, I mean?’ 



‘We built,’ he replied, ‘these things take time. I mean, you need the fundamentals, the 2-step, if you will, and then you find the right partner, and if you communicate, you get into more advanced movements.’ he paused, laughing, ‘I’m glad I used a dance metaphor because I was tempted to use boxing and that could have sent a mixed message. When you’re younger and a boxer, you have the idea that you can conquer someone when it's all about collaboration.’ 



The women returned from the bedroom, and Natalie gushed over Emma’s designs and all the great things they could do together with the dropshipping business. 



‘What are you guys talking about?’ Natalie said. 



‘Men’s talk,’ I answered, ‘amorous concerns.’ 



It sounded a lot cleverer in my head and made me sound even more stupid when it left my mouth because the words were all mangled by whiskey. I was rapidly exiting the golden zone. 



Emma tipped me a concerned look. It wouldn’t be the first time she’d put me to bed. 



I doubled down. 



‘I’m getting some tips from the master… it’s funny, you know, why we invited you over.’ 



Emma always made this movement when she was nervous. She’d reach over her shoulder and scratch her back. It reminded me of someone trying to unfurl a parachute. 



‘Why’s that?’ Nicholas said. 



‘Well,’ I slurred,’ I didn’t get much sleep last night, or the night before, with you two at 2am. The walls shaking. It sounds like you have quite the sex life.’



Nicholas peered at me, giving me a look I knew had never crossed his face before. The muscles simply didn’t know how to move that way, and he suddenly seemed grotesque. 



‘What do you mean, pal? I’ve been away on business the last two nights.’

1iaxjvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1iaxjvp/how_to_be_an_awesome_house_guest/,How to be an Awesome House Guest,"When someone invites you to their home, they are giving you a gift. Circumstances vary widely, but usually, the guest owes something non-monetary in return for the gift of time, effort, skill, and expense. The host is investing in the guest. What does he or she receive in return?

Although cultures differ, one thing is constant in hospitality: the guest should show gratitude.

Sometimes that gratitude should appear before the event even begins. Any invited guest should respond with an RSVP or a returned phone call. Often, the guest should bring a gift when invited to a special meal or for an overnight or extended stay.

In this post, however, we will address the most basic and universal meetings between host and guest: a meal; coffee, tea, or snacks; a time of recreation and socializing.

While it might seem to the guest that the host did not go to much trouble, a guest should consider what goes into the gift of hospitality, large or small.

·       **Time:** The host must set aside the time. Time is one of our most valuable resources, and giving up an evening or afternoon is a sacrifice.  The host might otherwise be working, taking care of responsibilities, spending time with loved ones, or simply unwinding. Instead, they are giving that time to you.

·       **Expense**: Even if the host serves veggies they grew themselves, food is an expense. Simple cookies and a cup of coffee can be a generous offering to the guest for a low-income family. Giving always costs someone something.

·       **Effort:** Creating a welcoming space might simply mean moving newspapers off the couch, but it always requires some effort. Usually, a host will try to find or buy appealing food; clean, set up, or prepare the place where they will share food; and possibly even use special dishes or linens.

·       **Skill:** Hosts often use their culinary or presentation skills to make the meal exchange special. Your host might make a special recipe, create a comfortable atmosphere, clean their home, or arrange decorations to please guests. They might choose music or an ambiance to make guests happy or comfortable.

If you are a guest, you should make it a habit to recognize the time, expense, effort, and skill required to host you. Doing so will enrich the time with your host and help you better connect.

How will you respond to hospitality? Here are some common ways to reciprocate the care your host has offered.

·       **Be punctual:** If a host has worked hard so everything is ready and food is warm, tardy guests can cause problems. Be on time.

·       **Show gratitude:** Any host deserves thanks—from the time you walk in the door. Remember, this event or meal is a gift. You can show your gratitude in a number of ways.

**1.     Host Gift:** A bottle of wine, flowers, a plate of home-made cookies, or a jar of your grandmother’s preserves are thoughtful gifts.

**2.     Effort:** Offering to help serve or clean up is usually welcome in an informal meal.

**3.     Contribution to the meal:** For somewhat informal meals, it’s good to ask what you can bring to contribute, whether bread, salad, dessert, or drinks. The host should be providing the main elements of the meal. Drinks or snacks might be welcome for a movie or game night.

**4.     Thank you note:** If you received an invitation via mail or electronically, you should at least send a thank you the way you were invited. For example, if you received a paper invitation, you should send a traditional thank-you note. If you received an email or other electronic invitation, you should call, text, or email a heartfelt thank-you—even though the hard copy is often still the best. Send it promptly: the same evening or the next day.

·       **Use your words:** Rather than generally raving about how nice everything is, comment on something specific you liked. That way, your host will know you were paying attention and engaged in the meal.

§  “The pasta was amazing! Thank you for making such a special dish.”

§  “Although I enjoyed the whole meal, your dessert was my favorite part. Thank you.”

§  “What a beautiful table! You certainly know how to set up a welcoming meal.”

§  “The conversation made me feel so at home. Thank you for listening to what I shared. That means a lot to me.”

§  “I really enjoyed just hanging out with you and having snacks. Thank you for making this time happen for us.”

·       **Smiles:** Showing you are having a good time makes the effort and expense worthwhile. Arriving with a smile, upholding good cheer through your time together, and exiting with a handshake or friendly hug can seal the deal that a gathering is intended to create.

·       **Reciprocate:** In many cultures, guests are expected to invite the host in return. This custom varies from place to place, but if you want to develop a relationship with the host, you should think of a way to reciprocate.

Sometimes an event doesn’t turn out the way you wanted it to. You can still thank your host for their effort and time in preparing and presenting the meal or hosting the event.

I got my boy Loki from a farm when he was \~6 weeks old. Someone had dumped him there, so we're unsure what sort of things happened to him before that age. He wasn't feral, but he was fearful. In the year and a half since, he's become extremely bonded to me and will seek me out for comfort. He's literally terrified of everything and everyone else.

Someone comes in? He is *gone* \- hiding under the bed and refusing to come out. Dog barks? Doesn't matter if he's in his ""safe spot"" loafing inside my house coat cuddling - he is jumping away as if I suddenly turned to aside. My partner stirs his coffee with a spoon - eyes wide, airplane ears, zooming towards my bedroom. Hell, he'll slink away if my partner even looks at him funny.

I am uncertain what to do at this point. I was hoping that with age, he would mellow out, or that he would look to my older cats  - a senior 16 year old and a 9 year old, who just absolutely do not react, and learn to relax, but that's not the case. He's still just as randomly fearful as he ever was. I attributed it at first to whatever happened to him before I got him, but at this point, I doubt he even remembers that far back.

Would anyone have any tips or tricks that I can use to put him at ease in his own home? It hurts to see him be so terrified at random noises and sounds when he should just be happy and relaxed.",1,1737945227.0,CATHELP,1,1.0,False

1iaxibk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iaxibk,New Fidget Day!,"So got a couple.of New fidgets. Rememered a few I forgot, so it's kinda like new. And updated an old one with a new part. I got the Wanwu mini bali and added the optional ring .  I've been fidgeting with it, but not feeling it...so it will probably go up for sale.  Also picked up the Bruce Charles Design Robertson brass slider with the Equal middle plate..these are fun and super high quality. Next are two YEDC Pig Ceramic fidgets- one is a slider and the other a mix mechanical and haptic coin. I also have the coin in SS too, but prefer the Ceramic. It has a ""clack clack"" sound/feel to it that's different...like hitting 2 stones together (which basically what ceramic is)..so keep an eye out for the SS going up for sale too. Then there's the new Muyi X MOT PEACOCK, which is just a Shuffle just in a different form...it kinda fits in my hand better bc of the curve. And what looks like a Nutter Butter cookie (yummy my fav) is by far the funnest slider I have.....it flies around and I have no worries about dropping it! Then we have what looks like a fidget stick... which is half right....it's actually a hex bit holder with Ti shaft (hehe I said shaft 😁) and Zirc spinning  head by Metonboss...this thing is not only fun and fidgety ( although it doesn't spin as long as a dedicated fidget stick) it's practical bc I'm a FSE and this will just be part part of my tools I carry every day. I updated the lanyard on the Shuffle v3 with a Wanwu PAPER CUP Knife Bead Fidget Spinner Coffee Zirc & Brass...and yes that brass middle piece spins! I forgot I had the Around Square Beglari and I forgot to picture (bc I don't know where it is atm) the Knucklebone. Also the Ladder sliders that I got off Etsy (the BCD knockoffs) I forgot I also had black 3D printed versions as well. Also I just found out.... all of the ladder sliders both the Etsy ones and the BCD play nicely together...I can mix and match them...the combinations are limitless! Ha! And the final one that I totally forgot about is the magnet ball bearing spinner. I.forget the official name of it...but it spins around that center piece soooo smoothly.

1iaxgxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckeryUniveristy/comments/1iaxgxn/beans_and_bullets/,Beans And Bullets,"We’d conducted an amphibious landing on the Korean coast, in the winter season, three days previously.  We’d begun moving inland, after we’d made our way through the thin belt of trees along the shoreline.  And we’d been on the move, on foot, day and night, since then.  The only relief an occasional halt that never lasted for more than twenty minutes or so, and usually for much less than that.  

Mason and I were exhausted, sleep-deprived, and had sweated off about five pounds apiece on scullery duty aboard ship Before we’d left it. Our Plt Sgt Hardass was a vindictive individual, and the two of us were still paying for some things.  Entirely innocent of the allegations, of course. As always.  Angels without wings. We should’ve been issued olive drab halos.  

And none of us had eaten in all that time, except for the odd candy bar from Ship’s Store that had been divided and shared around the first day.  

A breakdown in logistics was the reason given, but we smelled distinct musty odor of rodent. We were being toyed with again, in our experience and opinion.  Such a scenario as this might easily play out in real time in future, and so let’s see how far and how hard we can push these guys in adverse conditions and have them still be effective. 

“The Long Walk”.  We’d covered a lot of ground.  “Miles to go before we sleep.”

Sleep was something you learned to do anywhere at any time in any conditions.  A few minutes here, a few minutes there.  Just close your eyes and you’re gone.  

You could just zone out a little while walking.  Half asleep on your feet, in a sense, but still aware of and alert to everything around you.  

I knew guys who could sleep soundly in the back of a truck on a rough road as they were being bounced and jostled around. 

I fell asleep sitting with my back against the trunk of a tree in cold pouring rain once and rested well. 

But as on the Seventh Day, we rested for a couple of hours late on what was our fourth. I don’t now recall how far we’d come, but can make an educated estimated wild hair guess, being conservative:

On our annual fast-paced route march for time, 25 miles in 7 hours, if I remember right, was minimally acceptable. 3 times that would be 75 miles and a little more in 24 hours, if the pace could have been maintained.  But this time we hadn’t been moving as fast as that, packing an issue of cold weather gear in addition to our weapons and usual standard kit.  So cut that by maybe a third.  50 miles a day for 3 days would be about right, as far as I can figure.  There was a reason some of us who’d been slim to start with no longer had much body fat at all, over time.  Just strong, wiry muscle.  But we could go on 
as long as we needed to, and still be capable of immediately going into immediate action when we got there, or along the way.  

Which was the stated goal.  As one Battalion Commander once told us:  “If Roman Legionaires could do it, so can you.  And you’re going to.”

Or another:  “We’ll face the Soviet Union in the field one day.  They have more troops and more equipment, and they always will.  We’ll never match them for that.  But they rely too much on transport, which we also won’t have enough of.  So we have to be better prepared to move on foot.  Better man for man.  Turn their strength into their weakness.  That applies to the tactics we teach you, as well.”

Their view on things, anyway. 

But as to that 2 hour stop:  at a point along the way, you’d stopped really feeling hungry anymore.  It had become a distant thing, to be out in the back of your mind and disregarded.  You can go a long time without eating, if you have plenty of water.  And water we were continually supplied with (see what I mean, lol).  Without water, no one was going to last long.  

Later came a kind of euphoria, as lack of food and increasing exhaustion set in.  You didn’t feel physically tired anymore, except in a distant academic sense.  Your feet felt as if they never quite touched the ground.  You were as light as a feather, and knew you could go on forever.  

But when that finally passes, and you start to come down from it, you crashed Hard.  It all catches up to you.  

We weren’t in good shape by then, and Mason had I hadn’t been to start with.  Everyone desperately needed those two hours of sleep.  And something to eat.  The rest of the Battalion were in the same boat. 

But no sleep for Mason and me, lol.  And a few others.  We’d really pissed him off that last time, and he’d taken it personal.  

And that fellow hillbilly could carry a grudge like a bucket holds water, lol.  He seemed to Hate my young self sometimes.  But we enjoyed each others’ company off-duty, and got into more than a little trouble together.  Buddies. Life can be strange. 

The conclusion I’ve reached over time is that I reminded him too much of himself. I was as least as stubborn as he was.  We butted heads a lot.  Maybe it was just something in the genes.  We were both from the Hills, and ours are some of the most hard-headed people on earth.  Scottish, English, and Irish ancestry for the most part. 

I was seeing things that I knew weren’t there, by that point.  And I was wishing the guy standing beside me would just shut Up! He was becoming irritating.  Would’ve been nice to clock him one.  But I’d already glanced his way, and he wasn’t there, either.  Kept on nattering, though.  😂😂

“Everybody!  We’ll be heard for a couple of hours!” From Hardass.  “Drop your packs and get some sleep.”

About time, and I dropped mine and prepared to do the same:

“Not you, asshole!”  (I was the asshole in question at the moment).  You come with me.”

Oh, you rat bastard!

Perimeter guard watch.  Extended perimeter.  By myself.  Mason, I assumed, was standing his own. But maybe not.  Hardass, that tic on a dog’s ass, had seemed to hold me primarily responsible for some reason (wasn’t).  And someone had to be on watch anyway. 

“So Tired” I thought, a whole into it.  “Think
I’ll just sit down for a minute…..lean back against this tree……won’t even close my eyes…….”

“Hehehe.”

Opened ‘em again.  How and when had that happened?  

Marines I didn’t know.  And they had my rifle and  my radio.  

4 of ‘em.  A probing patrol.  Sneak and peek. Gather intelligence.  I was ashamed.  I’d just let my friends down in the worst possible way.  In other times and places, I’d have been executed in front of them for this.  Never should have sat down.  

Maybe give a shout of warning;  bring help on the run……would they even hear me?

“You try, we’ll buttstroke your ass” from the smiling fire team leader, reading my thoughts.  Holding his rifle ready to do so. 

A happy nod from one of his riflemen in complete agreement.  

…….Would they?….Yeah.  I would have.  They’d pull it, but it was still gonna hurt. 

“You’re comin’ with us.”

Then another thought occurred to me:  “There anything to eat there?”

“‘Course.  Why you ask?”

“Never mind.”  Ha!  Silver lining.

The base camp of some assigned aggressors from another unit whom we’d been told were operating somewhere in the vicinity.  And they had a field mess tent set up.  Mouthwatering time to the point I had to keep swallowing it down as my shriveled stomach reminded me how empty it was.  

Driving a borrowed jeep, Hardass showed up before too long.  Someone had sent word that there was little lost captured sheep to come collect. I was sitting on a short stack of wooden ammo crates with a tray in my lap.  Little cardboard cartons of milk and juice.  Hot food, and, Thank God!, hot coffee.  

I’d been eating slow, a little at a time - didn’t want to throw it all back up again.  Until here he came.  And from the look on his face, he was a lot more pissed off than even he habitually was.  

Started eating a little faster as he shut off the engine, climbed out, and started my way.  He might just kick the tray out of my hands before the scrap began.  

…..but then he stopped.  His face changed.  And he was looking at the tray on my lap;

“Where’d you get that?”

Mouth full, I nodded toward the mess tent not far away, and off he went.  

Shortly I heard voices raised in argument from inside it, one louder than the rest:  “I don’t give a flying’ Fuck if we ain’t from your God damn unit!!”

In short order, he was sitting next to me digging into a tray of his own as the jeep was being loaded.  

“This ain’t over, OP.  We’re still gonna talk about it later.”

“What I figured.”

We left with a jeep loaded down with hot chow in as many mess canisters as it would hold.  And coffee.  Hot soup.  Milk cartons bulging with milk and juice.   With the understanding that we’d be coming back for more if we needed to.  Word had come down that we’d be remaining in place until further notice.  But still no mention of chow. 

He could be persuasive.  And we were off to feed our boys.  

So I went from dereliction of duty to the man of the hour in the shortest turnaround imaginable, lol.  

As Harley put it:  “Man, OP, your fuckup really came through.  I’d kiss your bare ass if it wasn’t so nasty.”

He and I parted on fairly good terms when time was growing short for both of us to leave.  He’d be rotating back Stateside before me.  He’d called me to his office:

“You’ll be working with Camp Guard for the few weeks you have left, OP - keep you out of the field.”

“Unh-unh!  No.”

“It’s a beni, damn it!  Just standing post.”

I Hated standing post - most boring job in the world.  Would much rather be in the field with what few old friends still remained, most of the old crew having already left by then themselves.  Gary was gone.  Dog.  Larry.  Others.  It wasn’t the same - too many new faces. 

And I had no great love for Camp Guard personnel 
anyway.  

But The Count was still around.  Mason. Some others. 

“Can’t you get me out of it?”

“It’s comin’ from the Captain!  For once can’t you just keep your damn mouth shut and do what you’re told?!”

Lol, impasse as we glared at each other, then I turned to go. 

“OP.”  

“What?”

“Where you’re goin next - good luck, you hear me?”

“You too.”

I flashed back to the worst dust-up he, I, and a couple of others had gotten into what seemed like a long time ago now.  

Not long afterward, he’d come to my cubicle:  “Get dressed.  We’re goin’ to town.”

“No way.  Not after the last time.”

“Come on, man!”

“Don’t have the money.”

“I do.”

“…….Promise you won’t start no shit this time?”

I was still sore from that last adventure.  Various bruises and contusions still healing.  As was the busted lip.  But I hadn’t lost that molar after all.  

A non-commital look.  At least he was honest.  He was a foul-mouthed, mean drunk who didn’t even try to contain his more uncivilized tendencies.  I knew it.  He knew it.  We All knew it.  He was just about as mean when he wasn’t, for that matter. 

“Sure.  Why not?”

He cared little or none for rank.  Was insubordinate to a surprising degree.  And got away with it because he ran one of the most consistently highest performing platoons in the battalion.  

One with more than its share of unfortunate incidents of lack of discipline off-duty, as well, himself included, but it was sometimes that way.  

And nobody messed with His troops.  That was His job, lol, and he resented attempted intrusion.  
And he saw to it that we had what we needed to do our jobs and to have good down time to the best of his ability, with what we had at that time.  

He never said where he’d found that old 8mm projector that time, so I still wonder how long it took for someone to discover it was missing, lol.  Just a handful of non-training films with it, but he’s said he’d work on that. 

The best Plt Sgt I worked with in ten years in.  There should have been more just like him.  

I was 19 when I knew him, and it came as a surprise some years later to remember that he himself was only 27.  But 27 is old to someone still in their late teens.  

He’d be 72 years old now, if he’s still around. 

Old stories, and old memories.  But here’s to you, Hardass!  Wilson Clayborne Williams.  Will.  It was quite a time.

We have a 2.5 year old son. My husband is a good man and a good dad. I find it hard to even admit that I consider divorce because he doesn’t deserve it. However, he is a very strict member of the church of Jesus Christ (Mormon) and comes from a very strict family as well. I was baptized into the church shortly after meeting him and at the time it felt like it was something I wanted to do and something I wanted to believe in. I come from a very dysfunctional family and thought maybe the secret to success was to be Mormon. I wanted to break my family’s cycles and believed to only way to guarantee that was marrying someone who would never be addicted to drugs, have sex with someone else, be abusive, etc. because of his commitment to God and his religion. I married him because he was a good man. Not because I was crazy in love with him. Fast forward years later, I learn more and more about the problematic origins of mormonism and realize I don’t align with all of its teachings or standards. That however is not really allowed in my situation. Saying I don’t believe in the church is considered a pure act of rebellion and going against God and being a poor influence to my son for things like drinking an occasional Starbucks coffee. We have had many discussions since originally telling him I had my doubts about the church and basically it sums up to our marriage will survive even if I don’t fully believe as long as I keep the church guidelines and standards and allow my kids to be fully raised in it. Which feels disingenuous to me. I also can’t brush off the fact I’ve never truly felt like my husband was/is my best friend. We’ve never had a spark or true chemistry. He is a respectful, caring, hard working, God fearing man and that seemed like reason enough for 21 year old me to marry him. I still highly value and appreciate those qualities but most days it feels like something’s missing and that our marriage is conditional upon me believing/practicing a certain religion. I see other marriages who look so happy and like they truly married their best friend and can’t help but think that’s something worth looking for. Of course getting a divorce would be the biggest riskiest decision of my life and I’m so afraid of how that will affect my son. How his whole family would hate me. And how I’m maybe repeating the family cycle I was trying so desperately to break. To say I’ve been feeling lost is an understatement. I’d appreciate any thoughts? Thank you!

The financial means that derive from employment have a primary, baseline significance in the sense of one's ability to perform basic lifestyle tasks like using public transport, affording condoms, and affording to do simple and casual dates (i.e. tea, coffee, ice cream, yoghurt etc). The secondary level of significance comes from one's ability to engage in non-monogamy-specific lifestyle activities such as BDSM gear, sex toys, parties and workshops. In my personal experience interacting with non-monogamous folks, the latter doesn't come easy, especially with high costs of living.

I am 29, autistic, a cis het man, unemployed and living with my parents. I have Bachelors and Masters degrees in music. I am currently exploring the possibilities of becoming employed a librarian or piano tuner and getting off welfare. Dating in my early 20s was possible but did have it's fair share of limitations given that I didn't drive and I couldn't bring partners back to my home for sex.

* attending sex parties (where single males could be admitted)
* seeing sex workers

We did have coffee, talked for an hour or so, and I was pleasantly surprised because he talked (a lot, which I attributed to maybe nervousness, some pp get super talkative sometimes on a first ""date"" I don't know what other word to use even though it was not a proper date but wtv) about things that I am very into such as plant medicine and spirituality, amongst other stuff. I was really so so surprised, I was not expecting the guy to be so interesting and articulate. So I talked about my stuff too (martial arts and traditonal chinese medicine) and the convo was legit super nice. At the end he said we could start a nice friendship and I told him that I was down with that since I like to take my time and get to know the person. That all happened last Thursday. I had talked to him about a youtube channel and said I would text it to him so I did. Still on the same day but way later in the day (we met in the morning and I texted him at 5pm) he replied later (which is totally fine) at around 9 and said how he had a good time and how he was enchanted and thanked me and wished me good night. Fast forward to today. No text no nothing from him during the week end (he was also the last one to text with a ""thank you"" after my ""good night"" so idk maybe it was my turn or so I thought. So I texted him at 4 pm ""hello, you doing good?"" He read my text around 6h30pm and left me on read since. Like .. wtf? 😂 Am I overreacting? This guy seemed so interested to see me again .. to me this is so odd. Cause an truly interested guy would not have left me on read after a simple hello. I KNOW he may be ""busy"" but cmon now .. lets be realistic. Anyways. Just needed to vent I guess. If anyone decides to reply to me, before being mean, just know I am a very kind and emphatic person who always try to help others so please dont be mean I am already down.

Why am I doing this? Because why the fuck not? Also, all the mercs are canonically bisexual because I said so. Don't question me or I will sue you for defamation, lies, libel, slander, and the other thing.

# 1. Medic (Mastermind Horror Yandere - ""This is what I do to the people I love"")

Medic’s unhinged nature and obsession with his own twisted pursuits make him the ultimate ""scary yandere."" He wouldn't hesitate to use his medical knowledge to manipulate or even experiment on his beloved. Fuck, homeboy surgically implemented himself with 8 souls and then put a baboon uterus into Classic Heavy! This guy is fucked in the head and cannot be stopped. 

You talk to a guy and suddenly his eyes are replaced with octopus eyes and he's freaking out by seeing colors he never could before and dies from sensory overload. Another guy, you talk to him and he's pregnant with 15 pig babies and can't see you anymore. Then you walk up strapped to a table and prepped for surgery to have a ton of machinery put into you because ""This is what I do to the people I love.""

Yeah, Medic is the scariest mfer in TF2 and that is why he is the top tier Yandere.

# 2. Scout (Hotheaded Yandere - Extreme Jealousy and Possessiveness)

Scout tops the list as the quintessential hotheaded yandere. His brash arrogance, hyperactive personality, and over-the-top bravado make him a walking powder keg of jealousy and possessiveness. He makes his interest in you known IMMEDIATELY! You meet him and he instantly calls you hot and asks for a date. His fixation would lead to impulsive, often violent, displays of ""affection.""

You talk to another guy? That guy will NOT have a jaw the next day because he took a fucking baseball bat to it. You're talking to a Siri you set to have a male Bri'ish voice? Your phone is dead. He wakes you up at 4am to ask, ""EY EY! WHO DA FUCK IS ALAHM AND WHY DOES HE CALL YOU AT 7AM EVERY DAY!? HMM!?"" Scout would give you no room to breathe at all, thinking he is the best because, damn it, he is. (He was my main back in the day lmfao).

This all makes him a pretty damn good yandere. A suffocating force that gives you no damn room to breathe, but damn it you like being choked.

# 3. Pyro (Unaware Chaotic Yandere - Delusional and Dangerous)

Pyro is terrifying because he wouldn't even realize he’s a yandere. In his sugar-coated fantasy world, everything he does is ""for love,"" but the reality would be a fiery nightmare. His inability to distinguish reality from delusion makes him unpredictable and incredibly dangerous. He thinks he is giving you flowers and he's handing you a fucking bouquet of dynamite.

He thinks he is talking to the other guy you're talking to, but nah he's burning him alive. He thinks he's giving the OTHER guy you were talking to a lollipop but he was chopping his head off with a fucking axe. Pyro’s object of affection would likely be overwhelmed by the chaos he brings, making him one of the scariest yanderes in the lineup.

# 4. Soldier (Hotheaded Yandere - Passionate but Calmed by a Match)

Soldier aka Jane Doe is a damn war hero. Fighting in WWII long after it ended. He is intense with a warlike demeanor makes him a hotheaded yandere who would proudly and violently declare his affection. Yeah, like Scout. ""WOMAN!? YOU ARE ACCEPTABLE! YOU WILL BE MY WIFE!"" Is the first thing he says to you lmao.  
  
His obsession would be loud and direct, with over-the-top proclamations and extreme jealousy. ""I SAW YOU TALKING TO THAT BOY AT THE COFFEE SHOP! WHY ARE YOU GOING BEHIND MY BACK!? AM I NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU!?"" Because he saw you talking to the cashier... but-  
  
As we saw with Zhanna, Heavy's sister in the comics, he can be surprisingly grounded if he finds someone equally eccentric. This potential for balance keeps him from ranking higher, but his intensity remains undeniable. This because she was as intense as him. Even so, a mark against our good old Jane Doe.

# 5. Spy (Submissive Obsessive Yandere - Calculated and Romantic)

Spy’s suave, French, and romantic nature would translate into a methodical and obsessive yandere who would do anything to fuck your mom. Yes, not you, YOUR MOTHER. Spy's not a yandere for you, no no no. THAT WOULD BE YOUR MOTHER!  
  
His actions to fuck your mom would be cloaked in sophistication, with a veneer of charm hiding a deeply possessive streak. He’d manipulate situations from behind the scenes, ensuring your mom has no choice but to reciprocate. Sabotaging the dates she goes on, hacking her dating websites and tinder, and killing her lovers behind the scenes. But all with this idea of, ""I do it for love.""  
  
His calculating, cloak and dagger behavior makes for an honestly wonderful and intimidating yandere who hides behind the shadow. His romantic veneer all just adding to it. Your mom would never see him coming.

# 6. Engineer (Isolating Yandere - Overbearing but Well-Meaning)

Engineer’s quiet, soft-spoken demeanor hides a suffocating level of affection. A good ol' boy from Texas. He’d obsessively try to ""help"" his beloved, often with mechanical creations that ultimately complicate things. All his good intentions leading him down a bad road.  
  
While not overtly violent or terrifying, his relentless attempts to be indispensable would leave little room for personal space. His obsessive tendencies would stem from a desire to make life easier, but they’d quickly spiral into overwhelming codependency.

He basically does a yandere all by accident. Creating situations which, due to his machines, isolates you to him. Making him all that you rely on. Making him the only person you can go to when anything is needed. This, as such, marks him down some points for me.

# 7. Heavy (Very Submissive Yandere)

Heavy’s calm and level-headed personality would make him a surprisingly mild yandere. His obsession would manifest in protective behaviors, ensuring his beloved is always safe and cared for. While his size and strength could be intimidating, Heavy’s actions would likely lean more toward quiet devotion than overt aggression.  
  
Heavy would very likely jut be a run of the mill stalker. Watching you from afar and following you, but never directly intervening with you. Never stepping in to fight other lovers, never killing anyone, or doing anything insane. You just being there is enough for him. All you need to do to make Heavy happy is exist.  
  
This restraint places him lower on the list despite his potential, but adds a certain flavor to him. Mmm, is that... the bay leaf?

# 8. Demoman (Hotheaded Yandere - Passionate but Easily Doused)

Demoman’s fiery passion could make him a compelling yandere, but his penchant for drinking tempers his intensity. His obsession would flare up in moments of jealousy, but it wouldn’t sustain itself. His generally chill demeanor and occasional self-doubt make him less likely to fully embody the yandere archetype, despite his moments of fervor.

Plus, dude is loaded and the comics show he's actually like pretty chill, so I see him as having even less potential than Heavy because he'd likely forget about you in a night of drinking as he forgot many other things. As Demoman himself would say of my ranking of him, ""Ay, fair enough.""

# 9. Sniper (Conflicted Yandere - Suppressed Emotions and Duty)

As Sniper himself once said, ""Feelings are for blokes who bludgeon their wife to death."" So uh... hmph, yeah.  
  
Sniper’s stoic and professional nature makes him the least likely to become a yandere. His reserved personality and strict adherence to discipline would conflict with obsessive tendencies. While a deep internal struggle between duty and obsession could create compelling drama such as him having to conflict with these feelings mucking up his work, his emotional suppression and lack of lore about romantic interests leave him at the bottom of the ranking.

# Final Ranking Summary:

1. Scout
2. Medic
3. Pyro
4. Soldier
5. Spy
6. Engineer
7. Heavy
8. Demoman
9. Sniper

1iax60e,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1iax60e/rf_wants_grace_paley/,[Rf] “Wants” Grace Paley,"Hi,

I’m new to literature and poetry (4yrs in). I read this short story and wondered what ideas others have. 

“Wants”
by
Grace Paley
I saw my ex-husband in the street. I was sitting on the steps of the new library.
Hello, my life, I said. We had once been married for twenty-seven years, so I felt
justified.
He said, What? What life? No life of mine.
I said, O.K. I don’t argue when there’s real disagreement. I got up and went into
the library to see how much I owed them.
The librarian said $32 even and you’ve owed it for eighteen years. I didn’t deny
anything. Because I don’t understand how time passes. I have had those books. I
have often thought of them. The library is only two blocks away.
My ex-husband followed me to the Books Returned desk. He interrupted the
librarian, who had more to tell. In many ways, he said, as I look back, I attribute
the dissolution of our marriage to the fact that you never invited the Bertrams to
dinner.
That’s possible, I said. But really, if you remember: first, my father was sick that
Friday, then the children were born, then I had those Tuesday-night meetings,
then the war began.Then we didn’t seem to know them any more. But you’re
right. I should have had them to dinner.
I gave the librarian a check for $32. Immediately she trusted me, put my past
behind her, wiped the record clean, which is just what most other municipal
and/or state bureaucracies will not do.
I checked out the two Edith Wharton books I had just returned because I’d read
them so long ago and they are more apropos now than ever. They were The
House of Mirth and The Children, which is about how life in the United States in
New York changed in twenty-seven years fifty years ago.
A nice thing I do remember is breakfast, my ex-husband said. I was surprised. All
we ever had was coffee. Then I remembered there was a hole in the back of the
kitchen closet which opened into the apartment next door. There, they always ate
sugar-cured smoked bacon. It gave us a very grand feeling about breakfast, but
we never got stuffed and sluggish.
That was when we were poor, I said.
When were we ever rich? he asked.
Oh, as time went on, as our responsibilities increased, we didn’t go in need. You
took adequate financial care, I reminded him. The children went to camp four
weeks a year and in decent ponchos with sleeping bags and boots, just like
everyone else. They looked very nice. Our place was warm in winter, and we had
nice red pillows and things.
I wanted a sailboat, he said. But you didn’t want anything.
Don’t be bitter, I said. It’s never too late.
No, he said with a great deal of bitterness. I may get a sailboat. As a matter of
fact I have money down on an eighteen-foot two-rigger. I’m doing well this year
and can look forward to better. But as for you, it’s too late. You’ll always want
nothing.
He had had a habit throughout the twenty-seven years of making a narrow
remark which, like a plumber’s snake, could work its way through the ear down
the throat, half-way to my heart. He would then disappear, leaving me choking
with equipment. What I mean is, I sat down on the library steps and he went
away.
I looked through The House of Mirth, but lost interest. I felt extremely accused.
Now, it’s true, I’m short of requests and absolute requirements. But I do
want something.
I want, for instance, to be a different person. I want to be the woman who brings
these two books back in two weeks. I want to be the effective citizen who
changes the school system and addresses the Board of Estimate on the troubles
of this dear urban center.
I had promised my children to end the war before they grew up.
I wanted to have been married forever to one person, my ex-husband or my
present one. Either has enough character for a whole life, which as it turns out is
really not such a long time. You couldn’t exhaust either man’s qualities or get
under the rock of his reasons in one short life.
Just this morning I looked out the window to watch the street for a while and saw
that the little sycamores the city had dreamily planted a couple of years before
the kids were born had come that day to the prime of their lives.
Well! I decided to bring those two books back to the library. Which proves that
when a person or an event comes along to jolt or appraise me I can take some
appropriate action, although I am better known for my hospitable remark.",1,1737944071.0,shortstories,0,1.0,False

1iax5og,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1iax5og/my_best_friend_and_exboyfriend_is_sending_mixed/,My best friend and Ex-Boyfriend is sending mixed signals,"It's been about 3 months since the break up. It's still a roller coaster for me. He's started a new job after his temp job he got after he was let go, he seems to be much happier at this job. I was and still hope that we can eventually get back to where we were before we started dating, we would hang out just about every week, but since the break up we've been lucky if it's once a month. He's not very responsive by text anymore but he did say that he's started working on himself again (exercising, lifting, etc.).

I've outlined in my previous post some of the mixed signals when he and I had Coffee after the breakup. Since then he's sent many more mixed signals and a lot of things have happened too.A couple weeks after I had had a rough week (certain family things had happened). When those things were happening I was texting with him that evening and wrote that I may need someone to talk to. He called out of the blue to talk but I had to tell him that due to reasons I couldn't talk about it that night. When I finally went to bed he texted me ""Good night 'beautiful'"". Beautiful was written in a foreign language I learned in college and that he ""hates"" when I speak it around him. But he always ""gets back"" at me by butchering his pronunciation. But he spelled it correctly accent mark and all, not to mention a word I've never used around him. At coffee I had told him a phrase in that language to describe how I feel about him (not love but more than a simple best friend), and how to me certain phrases in that language may seem simple in English but have a more meaningful meaning in the other language. So him calling me ""beautiful"" something only ever used while we were dating messed with me a bit.

When he and I hung out soon after that (first time at his place since the break up) he got on the floor while I was playing with his cat and pulled me in for a brief cuddle and asked what had happened that week (the family thing), so I told him (as I was able to). After that he asked if I wanted to cuddle in his room. While we dated I was always the one ""in his arms"" the ""sub"", the ""little spoon"" even though I'm much taller. I was also the one that almost always asked to cuddle (going to sleep together, and sex excluded). But he was in my arms that time, and I could see some conflict in his eyes.

Fast forward and he goes on a brief week long vacation with family, and one night he texts that he had a good day drank quite a bit (I wouldn't say drunk, but a little intoxicated) and now just wants ""cuddles and a nap"". Then called soon after. At which point he says jokingly ""could you teleport here"".

Then Christmas day he called when he got back from work so like 2am left me a voicemail and the part that has caused some conflict is where he said ""... Thinking about You ... Um ... Have a good day"". It was a very pregnant pause of wanting to say something more but not.

Then the next time we hung out at my place we went back to my room, to have some privacy and he laid right on my bed taking up the whole bed and wanted to cuddle again. Again it was mostly him in my arms, I then finally told him somethings that I needed to say about past feelings, he then told me about shit he went through with his ex-fiance (a woman, he's bi, I'm gay). The gist of what he told me is that he broke it off because she was manipulative and mean. Later she tried to get back into his life, but soon was being manipulative to him again, he ended contact again, and how ever long later tried to come back into his life, he confronted her and asked ""do you actually want to be friends, or be manipulative and play the blame game again"" she showed her true colors again and he said that he yelled at her over the phone louder that he's yelled at anyone else in his life. He's a big guy, some may even call intimidating, but is a huge teddy bear inside, so it would take a lot to make him lose his temper.

While at my place we started wrestling and ""rough housing"", near the end he put my hand around his neck and squeezed it a little. While we were dating he was always the one that would ""choke"" me, let me be clear that it's never been hard enough to cause me to pass out, enough to get that natural reaction of a little bit of fear. But I'd never done that to him. He also jokingly implied that he was a ""bucket list item"" to me.

The most recent time we hung out, after a movie, he asked if I wanted to stay while he got ready for work or leave I said I'd stay and he then took one of the longest showers I've ever known. When we left and I was driving him to his car he said how Y (his friend and an ex, who I've met before, and while he and I were dating had thought they had dated in the past, was confirmed after the break up) and I are only friends. Then later said ""I'm glad you stayed while I showered, I don't normally take such a long shower, and feel vulnerable when I do"".

Just recently I asked him if we could cuddle some the next time we hangout and he said that he doesn't want to do that.

I now want to give a little bit more history on him for full context of my thoughts. Besides his nightmare of a ex-fiance, he dated a woman after that, someone that he'd been friends with years before. They had a fairly serious relationship then one day out of the blue things happened, it ended, and that relationship really ""damaged"" him. From there he's had at least a few other women that he's dated. Most if not all it sounds like he ended most on the basis of ""not feeling love"" for them. One of them he had been friends with previously as well and that blew up in spectacular fashion when she texted him a novel of pretty much ""everything I hate about you"". Leading up to us dating he had told me that he's lost some other friends too recently and that he can't afford to lose another, he had me ""promise"" that if anything bugs me about him that I would tell him and not bottle it up.

I feel that he still has feelings for me, and that he ""self sabotaged"" the dating relationship out of fear of losing me ie if he let it go longer and then something happened and our friendship ending the same as the others. My normal therapist somewhat agrees, has expressed how what I've said shows that he appears to have had a lot of ""trauma"" in his previous relationships. Of course I haven't gone into full detail here for privacy reasons. But many times since the break up I feel he's done the opposite of what most ""ex's"" would do. As for him saying that us dating was a ""bucket list item"" to me I feel he may have said that out of insecurity in himself and wanting to ""downgrade"" the relationship. He never has and never will be, he means to much to me to be a simple item on a list.

I'd like to hear what others thoughts are on this. I don't want anything similar to what one of my friends said, who pretty much said ""drop him like a hot rock"". I can't and won't, but something like give it more space go back to strictly just friends, or similar is welcome. But the biggest thing I need is thoughts on what others think, am I ""right"", ""wrong"", over thinking it, does it seem realistic that there is trauma (I think it's pretty obvious), does it seem realistic that someone may do what he's doing because he's ""scared"".

I also want to ask him directly if he feels it may progress to something more again, tell him that he doesn't need to give me detail but that a simple yes, maybe, i don't know, or no would work. And tell him that if it's a no I'm fine with that, but that if it is I can't have him changing his mind later, that I wouldn't be able to emotionally handle that, if it's a no I need to start to ""close"" that door / chapter. But that if it's any of the others I won't wait forever but I would respect his feelings and wait some time for him. I need to ask him so I know what expect at this point, is this him still showing feelings, or is this just him wanting to ""have fun"", I'm ok with that but I don't do good with the ""unknown"".

I know what I think, what my therapist thinks, and some of my friends think, but I tend to get caught up in my head, and just need to hear from the aether that is the internet and Reddit.

I met her, let's say K, for the first time recently on a double date and felt like I owed her an explanation after I bailed on part of our plans due to having a panic attack. During this hang, we got coffee, shopped and bopped around, and then got brunch. Before brunch, I found out a few noteworthy things I planned to share with my partner. First, I found out that K and G have been dating for four months and will be going on vacation to Mexico on Thursday. The conversation drifted to future travel, and she spoke of 3 or 4 additional trips planned, with two that I recall including month+ trips with G.  She said both she and G \*do not\* want kids and were on the same page about that.

The problem is that I know from conversations with G and my fiance that it is a lie. My fiance described G as eager to have children soon and said they both had/shared lists about what they were looking for in a relationship. When I met G, he spoke about intentionally dating for marriage and wanting kids.  At the time, G was also dating someone 24 while he was 36.

I am blunt and remember calling him about this age gap. We did the math (that adage of 1/2 age +7), and it was decided that since (his now ex) was turning 25 that year, he ""passed."" This was one of the first conflicts in my relationship; my fiance said I shouldn't have brought this up, while I argued that her frontal lobe wasn't developed, that G is wealthy (he has a successful business and is worth 5mil+), and that there was a clear power differential. But my fiance defended his friend with the excuse that he was recently divorced, going through therapy, and figuring things out. He said I was taking things personally because I am the product of an age-gap relationship. For a few months, he went on to joke about age gap relationships, teasing me when they showed up in media or constantly pointing out people in them. G didn't date the 24y/o too long, and I only met her once or twice. However, this caused a strain on my relationship with G and my partner.

Then, roughly 6 months later, while helping my fiance with a task on his iPad (we share passwords, devices, accounts, etc.) I see an incoming message from G that reads:

"" 2nd date with a girl went well. 21 years old. Her purpose is to help others. Loves to cook. Works at HEB. Grew up in healthy family dynamic. Went through / going through party phase. Lives with lots of fam in New Braunfels. Comes off as non-promiscuous. Studied the Bible. Under 5 sexual partners. Never had a boyfriend. Parents were high school / college sweethearts.  Wants kids.

Best option so far but still need to vet further. ""

I was engaged; I took a screenshot and spoke to my partner about it. We fought, and I said I didn't want to socialize with G again. Months later, I agreed to try again after hearing he had ""matured.""

Back to the present day,  I am at brunch with K and find out she recently had a pregnancy scare. She mentioned she had an abortion in the past and would have one if needed. She also said that she and G were discussing a vasectomy. The conversation drifted to the boys and how they might gossip about the news they learned from us today, and she asked me what was the most surprising thing I learned today.

I gossiped and told her the truth. But b/c I \*really, really\* don't like G, and my intuition was screaming at me that she needed to know. Based on the above, I said I was surprised he didn't want kids. I showed and sent her the text. We spoke about his ex-wife (more background than I care to write now, but I also think that relationship was abusive). We both agreed that the story didn't add up, as both G and his ex claim they were abusive, and the boys claim she was a gold digger. But we know she was in college and didn't speak English when they met, so she moved to the US for him. Then, the marriage dissolved when she didn't want to start a career. K and I both agreed the text was predatory. But, also, she was so in shock and left in a rush. I still feel terrible. I told her because I am tired of folks minimizing G's behavior, I think it's gross, but even our couple's therapist said (re: 21 y/o date) that she was 18 and allowed to make her own decisions. I was floored; no one I spoke to about this besides one friend agreed that G was a creep.

I'm debating whether I ruined her relationship or saved her from a creep. So, AITAH?

Growing up in the tiny town of Mud Creek, population 147 (148, if you counted Old Man Jenkins’ dog, who everyone swore, was part human), meant a few things. It meant that everybody knew everybody, and not just in the “Hey, how’s it going?” kind of way. No, in Mud Creek, people knew what you had for breakfast, what you argued about with your spouse last night, and whether or not you’d remembered to feed your chickens. It also meant that when something unusual happened—like Jeb “Two-Shots” McGee dropping dead in the middle of Main and 1st—the entire town reacted like it was the Second Coming.

Jeb was the town drunk, a title he wore with pride. He’d earned the nickname “Two-Shots” because, as he liked to say, “One shot’s for the drink and the other’s for the road.” He was a fixture in Mud Creek, as much a part of the landscape as the rusty water tower or the general store that hadn’t seen a fresh coat of paint since Eisenhower was president. So, when Jeb suddenly collapsed in the middle of the town’s only intersection, it was a big deal.

# The Incident

It all started on a Tuesday, which was already unusual because Tuesdays in Mud Creek were about as exciting as watching paint dry. Jeb had been celebrating the anniversary of his first drink (or so he claimed) at the Mud Creek Saloon, which was just a shed with a bar and a jukebox that only played Patsy Cline. By sunset, Jeb was three sheets to the wind and decided to take his celebration to the streets. He staggered out of the saloon, singing a slurred rendition of *Your Cheatin’ Heart*, and made it exactly 12 steps before he face-planted in the middle of Main and 1st.

The next morning, a group of locals gathered around Jeb’s motionless body. Miss Sally, the town’s self-appointed doctor (she’d once bandaged a cat’s paw and charged only $5), was the first to arrive. She knelt beside Jeb, poked him with a stick, and declared, “He’s dead.”

“Ain’t you gonna check his pulse, Miss Sally?” asked Tom, the town’s postal worker, part-time sheriff, mayor, and occasional foot masseuse. Tom had been elected sheriff because he’d seen every episode of *COPS* and owned a pair of handcuffs he’d bought at a flea market.

“Nah,” Miss Sally said, waving her stick dismissively. “He’s as dead as dead. Look at him—he ain’t movin’, ain’t breathin’. Dead as a doornail.”

Tom scratched his head. “Well, what now? If we don’t bury him fast, the whole town’s gonna stink.”

Miss Sally nodded solemnly. “You fellas grab a shovel and start diggin’ a grave in the graveyard. Try not to dig up one of our kin this time.”

# The Burial

The graveyard in Mud Creek was more of a glorified patch of dirt with a few crooked headstones. It was located behind the church, which was really just a repurposed barn. The townsfolk got to work, digging a shallow hole while Tom supervised. Meanwhile, a few others lifted Jeb’s limp body and carried him to the grave. They dropped him in unceremoniously, and Jeb landed with a soft *thud*.

“Where’s Jenkins?” Tom asked, looking around for the town’s preacher. Jenkins had been elected to the position because he’d once stayed in a motel that had a Bible in the nightstand. He showed up a few minutes later, clutching a tattered copy of *The Good Book* and looking like he’d just rolled out of bed.

“Shouldn’t we put some dirt on top of him?” Jenkins asked, squinting at Jeb’s body. “If we don’t, he’ll stink up the whole town.”

“Good idea,” Tom said, and he grabbed a shovel. He tossed a few handfuls of dirt onto Jeb, who didn’t stir.

Jenkins cleared his throat and began the eulogy. “Now let us remember, umm…” He paused, looking at Tom for help.

“Jeb,” Tom whispered.

“Right, Jeb,” Jenkins continued. “Jeb is to be not forgotten and so thee and all that.” He went on for a while, sprinkling in words like *thee* and *shall* to sound official. The townsfolk nodded along, though no one was really listening. They knew Jenkins was done when he stopped talking and stared off into the distance.

What broke the silence was a fart—a loud, unmistakable fart that echoed through the graveyard. It startled Misses Johnson, who was at least ninety and couldn’t hear much of anything. Her response to everything anyone said was, “What?” The townsfolk just assumed she was from the north, where people talked funny.

The fart, of course, came from Jeb, but no one noticed. They were too busy holding their noses and looking at each other in an accusatory fashion.

“I think he’s startin’ to rot,” Miss Sally said, fanning the air with her hand. “Are we done?”

Everyone nodded in agreement and left, leaving Jeb in his shallow grave.

# Jeb’s Awakening

Later that day, Jeb woke up. He didn’t notice the dirt covering him or the fact that he was in a grave. He just stretched, turned over on his side, and went back to sleep. It was the best sleep he’d had in years.

When he finally woke up for good, it was dark. He sat up, brushed dirt off his face, and looked around. “Where the heck am I?” he muttered. He climbed out of the grave, dusted himself off, and stumbled back into town.

The next morning, the townsfolk were gathered at the general store, sipping coffee and gossiping about Jeb’s untimely demise. They nearly dropped their mugs when Jeb walked in, looking as alive as ever.

“Mornin’, folks,” Jeb said, grabbing a cup of coffee. “Y’all wouldn’t believe the dream I just had. I was at my own funeral!”

The townsfolk stared at him, their mouths hanging open.

“Well,” Tom said finally, “I guess we’d better dig that grave back up. Jenkins, you got any more of them fancy words?”

Jenkins sighed. “Thee shall not bury a man who ain’t dead.”

And with that, life in Mud Creek went back to normal—or as normal as it ever got.

# The Day Mud Creek Became Famous

One day, Tom was sitting in his sheriff/mayor/mailman/foot masseuse office when Sam, a local, came running in. “We’re famous, Tom! They’re takin’ pictures!” Sam dragged Tom out to the main road, where a fancy city jeep had pulled up. A man in a crisp button-down shirt and khakis was taking pictures of Miss Sally’s house, which looked like it hadn’t seen a paintbrush since the Civil War. The house was leaning precariously to one side, and the porch was held up by what appeared to be sheer willpower.

The man saw Tom, who was wearing his mayor hat (a cowboy hat with a badge pinned to it), and introduced himself. “Hi, I’m Steve from the *Lyndon B. Johnson Chronicles*. We’re doing a bit about old houses.”

“Johnson, did you say?” Tom asked, his eyes lighting up. “Someone go get Misses Johnson! She’s got kin!”

The townsfolk thought this was a fantastic idea. Misses Johnson, who was nearly blind and hard of hearing, was helped to the road. She squinted at Steve and declared, “Yep, he’s kin, sure enough!” (She couldn’t see much, but she was always willing to go along with whatever the town decided.)

Before Steve could protest, Jeb threw an arm around him and said, “We should celebrate!” Jenkins chimed in with, “Glory shall thee be!” and the townsfolk dragged Steve to the Mud Creek Saloon.

# The Celebration

At the saloon, Jeb poured Steve a glass of his special bootleg whiskey, which smelled like gasoline and tasted like regret. Steve, not wanting to offend his newfound “kin,” drank it. And then he drank another. And another.

By nightfall, Steve was drunker than he’d ever been in his life. He stumbled out of the saloon, muttering something about “quaint local customs,” and made it exactly 12 steps before he collapsed in the middle of Main and 1st.

The next morning, the townsfolk gathered around Steve’s motionless body. Miss Sally poked him with her stick and declared, “He’s dead.”

Tom sighed. “Well, you know what that means. Grab a shovel, boys.”

And so, the cycle of life (and death) continued in the little town of Mud Creek.

# Epilogue

Steve woke up in a shallow grave later that day, brushed the dirt off his face, and stumbled back to his jeep. He drove away as fast as he could, vowing never to return to Mud Creek. The townsfolk, meanwhile, added another chapter to their legend. And Jeb? He just smiled, poured himself another drink, and said, “Welcome to Mud Creek, where the dead don’t stay dead, and the living don’t stay sober.”",1,1737943828.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False
1iax2xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1iax2xb/rant_on_distribution_tamping_and_gadgets/,"Rant on distribution, tamping, and gadgets","By this point we’re all familiar with the myriad of techniques/gadgets available for distribution and tamping - table tapping, WDT, blind shaker, curved vs flat bottom tampers, amount of pressure, etc. And all these supposed scientific studies showing a slightly higher/lower percent of extraction, TDS, etc.; but we don’t really see any randomized BLIND taste tests to see if it really makes a big difference in the taste and enjoyment.

For me, I grind straight into portafilter which often ends in a center mound. I tap it a couple of times to settle the grinds, and tamp (granted I do have a self-leveling calibrated tamper), and that’s it. I use a sprout as I hate seeing the inevitable drip splatter on my espresso cup (never mind the occasional spritz), so I could care less how “pretty” my shots come out from a naked basket. I went back and forth using a WDT the last few months, and I could never really appreciate the improvement in taste vs my old methods.

Now I get it, part of this hobby is about perfection, but at the end of the day it’s the taste that’s the most important. How much does it matter if it’s 20 or 19 or 22% extraction if one cannot distinguish the taste difference at the end of the day? All that work and money for what?

So until I see a well designed, convincing blind taste study that can reliably demonstrate taste differences, I’d rather not line my bar with a ton of gadgets just to add extra steps and cleaning. And I’ll admit I have a certain amount of skepticism regarding supposed coffee experts that often speak highly of the next big technique or gadget to buy when their entire livelihood depends on it.

\- Legend (1985)

[Eigengrau](https://preview.redd.it/qvqfk76q1gfe1.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=712384f80c6c49012ff9bd8d4fdf06d880347c38)

Fear of the Dark, as well as being a 1992 album by hallowed heavy-metal group Iron Maiden, is one of the more common phobias. It is triggered, essentially, by over-thinking all the horrible things that would or could happen when the sufferer finds themselves in a dark environment. Children are particularly prone to it.

Tripping over something, or banging your knee on a coffee-table don't count. We're talking rather more visceral horrors here, like accidentally popping a slug while wearing socks, or realising that the reason it's dark is because you've got a large pot labelled ""Hunny"" accidentally jammed over your head.

Recent exposure to a scary event can exacerbate the condition... which is why it is rarely a good idea to walk home in the dark after watching a horror movie.

The root cause of all this extra anxiety is humanity's development as a species which is not historically nocturnal. Our eyes just aren't adapted to the dark, and our other senses are not acute enough to compensate. Plus, the things that were better adapted to the dark were also historically quite well adapted to eating us.

Big cats, and the like. Or even small but very determined ones.

This is why the danger signals tend to go off at night. Even people who aren't afraid of the dark will tend to have heightened responses - increased heart rate, faster breathing, etc.

But are we ever, really, in the dark? Technically, yes, we can be in a location in which there is no light. No photons. No chance of the eye picking up anything. And yet... it does.

Even in the most pitch-black darkness, the human eye will rarely happily tell you ""Nope. Nuffin' there, guv'nor. Just some blackness."" - and there are two things that it might do.

1. **CEV** \- or Closed Eye Visualisation: Essentially, the biological equivalent of the static that you get on an un-tuned TV... only without the loud ""FFFFFFFFFFFFF!"" noise. (Unless you step on some Lego.)
2. **The Eigengrau** \- a shade of not-quite-black grey which becomes even more evident as your eyes try to adjust to the lack of light.

Interestingly, both of these effects are mostly caused by the same thing. Random sparking of the optic nerves, and the neurons in the part of the brain which processes optical signals.

Essentially, you're able to see just how much noise is usually in your vision, only without it being obscured with all of that... well... televisions, mountains, post-it-notes, goats, books, paintings, and Roddy McDowell cluttering up the works.

So don't worry! Just because it is pitch black outside your eyes, it doesn't mean that the internal ongoing malfunction of your optical neurology won't make things a little bit less scary by giving you the impression that it's not quite as dark as you think it is.

Just remember...

- what’s the best way to approach my husband about doing more around the house?
- my husband is trying to be nice and give me a break and wants to take our 6 week newborn to my mother in law’s house overnight - should I go with them or have a day just to myself? 

Just wanted to say that this subreddit has been a lifesaver for me - I read the posts everyday and it’s given me comfort knowing a lot of others are going through the same thing! 

I just wanted some advice on how I could ask or approach my husband to take on more around the house - it’s now at the point that I despise his existence because he just creates extra work for me. I’ve tried talking to him and being direct but he just goes back to how he was after trying for a day. I’m not sure if it’s weaponised incompetence but the only thing he is capable of is changing a diaper (which I’m very grateful for that he does), but he just doesn’t do much else nor has any interest - I’ve explained wake windows and sleepy cues and he refuses to even acknowledge them which results in our newborn then screaming for hours on end. He doesn’t do laundry as he says he doesn’t know how, and he just dumps his dirty dishes in the sink unless I specify to him to put them in the dishwasher. If he’s bottle feeding our newborn he will leave her dirty bottles all over the place resulting in me having to go find them and clean them myself. He threatens that he only needs me because I breastfeed otherwise he would just automate formula feeding and have it all ready - which he’s never shown - I get the pre boiled bottles of water ready just in case we need formula. Anyways, the list is endless. I’m grateful he’s more present than other partners/husbands but I just feel so overwhelmed and regret my decision to become a parent. 

He wants to take our newborn to his mother’s house overnight to give me a break - should I go with them? My in laws are alright, the only thing they’ve done to really bother me is all come over the 2nd day I was home from the c section and not provide much help (I actually made them coffee and served them) and go against my boundary of picking up our newborn when i was still getting ready in our bedroom 

Are my expectations too high (please be blunt with me)? What can I do in this situation, thanks everyone! 

EDIT: also in addition - my husband keeps mentioning more lately that he feels unappreciated and not loved, which he says over and over again, but even though we have been somewhat intimate a few times over the last few weeks (with what we can do) he just doesn’t seem happy - could this be why he doesn’t want to do anything? He has been like this our whole marriage though ",1,1737943283.0,newborns,9,0.99,False
1iawwpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1iawwpi/i_went_on_my_first_date_and_apparently_screwed_it/,I went on my first date and apparently screwed it up. I have a few questions before I try again,"Okay so, I’m 24F. I’ve never kissed anyone, went on my first ever date Saturday night. I thought it went okay, but talked to him Sunday and he said otherwise. 
We met on hinge, and decided to meet up after talking for a week.

Dinner went fine, he was really really nice. Bill came, I offered to pay but he took it and paid. We mostly talked about our jobs and relationship goals, and then talked about getting coffee. The only thing that happened during dinner was he was a little annoyed I didn’t tell him I don’t drink alcohol until he tried to order me a drink so I made a mental note e in the future to tell people that.

The problems he talked about happened after dinner.  

We go out, his hinge profile said he liked cookies so I baked him some and handed them to him. Thanked him for dinner, and said I was going to start walking home but would totally go out again.
 
I noticed he kinda made a weird face, and he said I could come to his place but I declined. 

He tried to kiss my lips, and I got a little scared. I know it sounds stupid but I turned and made him kiss my cheek instead of my lips. I definitely made it awkward, but I grew up way too sheltered I guess because I thought kissing on the lips was a second date thing lmao

I started walking home, and saw his car pulling up to the stoplight and he didn’t look at me or wave, so I sent him a text and apologized and he responded today with this 

“Honestly, you’re one of the prettiest woman I’ve ever met. I’ll take you out again, but the fact you “didn’t feel comfortable” to come back to my place after I was nothing but respectful was extremely off putting. Then to not let me even kiss you was disrespectful. I’ve never once had a woman do that. If I take you out again and you pull that shit I’m gonna be annoyed lol”

I was a bit surprised at this, and now I feel really guilty. The kissing thing, I get probably seemed ridiculous. I’m an adult, my nerves just took over and I wasn’t expecting it.

So one question.. is it really normal to go to someone’s place on the first date? I don’t even think I would on the second date. Maybe 3rd, but meeting someone on a dating app and going to their house right away seems really scary to me. Anyone can pretend to be nice, and although I know most people are genuinely nice and are just looking for a relationship the consequences of trusting the wrong person would be a lot worse than the consequences of saying no to a good person.. 



And from Just from what I described, how bad of a date would you consider that? Even though in that text he said he would take me out again, the way the rest of his messages sounded I feel like he’s really not interested in doing that, so I don’t want to mess up next time I meet someone. Any advice is appreciated, I’ve been stressing over this all day!!!

Oh and also, he told me it was rude to offer to pay the bill.. but I’m scared it would be rude to not offer so men, how do you feel about that? Should I just offer to pay my own half? He said it in a nice way but still",0,1737943275.0,dating_advice,8,0.5,False

He has some lung issue (not cancer!!) but his doctor told him to stop smoking as his voice has become raspier within the last few years. It’s seriously scaring my family and I as he sneaks out twice a day to smoke outside even when it’s raining or snowing. 

So my siblings put me, the youngest and the girl, to tell him about it. I told him for his health to stop smoking and if he wanted nicotine patches to ease off the withdrawal and daytime I wouldn’t let him leave the house to smoke. 

Basically when I was at work he relapsed (-around two days) and began to get angry with me when I confronted it. My sibling snitched and I was bad cop while they were good cops. 

That happened three times in one week so after a bag fight he started screaming I just took his cigarettes and lighter from the table, went through the kitchen drawers and took out all lighters and even found matches. 

I reacted badly by tossing it in the garbage can outside and then he glared at me and called me “stupid, asshole,” things like that…

I know it’s not easy to get off smoking and he might have anxiety or something but he refuses family therapy or coffee or any alternatives we suggested for years. Also, he has no stress as he’s basically retired and travels around states helping his friends’ businesses for fun. 

The family is telling me I overreacted, especially my mom. My siblings turned on me. I feel bad. 

For people who were heavy smokers, how did you get off it, or can you literally not get off it?

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
- Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
- The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
- Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.\
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.\
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.\
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.\
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.\
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.\
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.\
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.\
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
- Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
- It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
- Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes \
- Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
- Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
- Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
- Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.\
- Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.\
Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.\
- Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.\
Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\

1iawqxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1iawqxw/we_spayed_our_cat_and_she_went_missing_inside_of/,We Spayed Our Cat And She Went Missing (Inside Of Our House),"Hey all

I have two cats that are 3 years old. They're littermates, brother and sister. The brother is a goofy air-head, and bonded to me. We got him fixed after she went into her first heat cycle - but because of money troubles, we weren't able to get his sister spayed until a few days ago. 

We've had a lot of trouble with her. She's very stubborn, and prone to causing trouble — but mostly she just makes our house messier than it is while acting like an innocent sweetheart. She was *never* prone to hiding though. The one time we had trouble with her hiding was a few years ago when she ran outside into our garage during a thunderstorm - I only found her by bringing her brother outside to meow for her (he was really worried) until I found where she was hiding. 

A few days ago, my grandparents finally took her to get spayed. They apparently gave her an extra dose of pain medication before she left. When she got home, she disappeared - but we found her hiding in a little box on a shelf. She was really out of it, to the point of even letting my step-grandmother pet her (which she never does because she's obsessed with my grandpa, and really jealous). I move their food and water bowls near to where she was resting so she wouldn't have to move much to feed herself, but I don't think she drank anything. Yesterday, she moved from the cardboard box to our dog bed, and again I moved our food and water bowls. . . And again I don't think she drank or ate anything. A few hours later and she had moved herself beneath one of our standing cabinets, so again I moved the bowls and she didn't eat or drink (to my knowledge). 

I took a few-hour nap right after, basically as soon as my grandparents got up. When I woke up, they said they couldn't find her *anywhere* - they had checked under *all* of our furniture. We even double-checked together. We picked up our couch, the chest that acts as our coffee table, we checked cabinets and shelves and boxes and the fireplace and vents and I even moved the dishwater out to see if she had gotten herself behind there. . . We can't find her ***anywhere***. Worse yet, I don't think her brother knows where she is either - or if he does, he's being a way sneaker about it than he ever has before (he's been routinely checking on her since she got back from the vet - and he's how I found her on the shelf and under the cabinet). I'm getting really worried, because she's probably getting dehydrated, and I want to give her water through a syringe to make sure she's hydrated. Plus, she hasn't come out to use the litterbox - I think she's just peeing herself, and I don't want her to get an infection so we *need* to clean her. 

I don't know where to look for her because we spent *hours* looking. She doesn't have access to any of our rooms, and she hasn't been moving quick enough to run into them (which she used to make a game of) to hide. Our bedroom doors are always shut. But we've still checked our bedrooms and bathrooms. We don't have access to our attic (cord broke) and there's no holes in the ceilings. We don't have a basement. All we have are 3 bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room, (completely empty) dining room, and our kitchen. . . Plus the garage, but I don't think she went outside (we checked our utility and laundry rooms just to be sure). I feel like such a bad owner for not knowing where she is or staying with her during recovery. . . I'm worried sick she's crawled into some hidden nook and she's gonna die if we don't find her :(

1iawnen,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iawnen,2025 Soup Stroll Report,"Welp! It’s January, and that means it’s soup time in the Electric City! 

This past Saturday was Schenectady’s favorite excuse for midwinter carousing and day drinking—the 9th annual Soup Stroll! Thousands of Schenectadians and visitors (including your humble and obedient servant) braved the 20 degree F weather to stand in line outside 32 of downtown’s best and brightest restaurants, cafes and pubs as they slung 3 oz. servings of their best efforts for $1 a pop. 

I spent 2 hrs soup strolling and was able to  enjoy six different samplings. Here is my full report. 

Soup #1 — Guinness Potato Chowder at Katie O’Byrne’s. Unappealing visually and gustatorily, this concoction was oddly sweet and had the distinct bitter flavor of something burning at the bottom of the pan. But the line was short and the vibes inside were lively.

Soup #2 — Beef, Mushroom and Toasted Barley at Tara Kitchen. A barley soup where barley was the star. Puffy, delightful little barley balls, all without the sliminess you sometimes get with barley soup. A solid effort. But, each year I wish this amazing Moroccan tagine restaurant would make a soup with more traditional Moroccan flavors. 

Soup #3 — Roasted Tomato Chicken Tortilla from Maria’s Cafe and Catering. Each year, Maria’s serves great soup, but there’s never much of a line! This was a flavorful delight with a nice kick of heat, and earned Maria’s a first runner-up place in the overall “Souperstar” category (did I forget to mention there is voting???)

Soup #4 — The Jerk Chicken and Mango Experience by “Chef” at Center Street Pub. I know this picture looks like a weird egg and salmon concoction. Actually, this was the highlight of the day for me. That note of jerk chicken was impeccably cooked—something you don’t expect from a big vat of soup! The flavors were on point, and everyone in the pub was having a great time that day, thanks in part to the live band playing 70s funk standards. This was my vote for Souperstar, Most Creative, AND Best Experience. Sadly it placed in none of those categories.

Soup #5 — Squatch Wing Chili at 20 North Broadway Tavern. 20 North had me intrigued by NOT announcing their soup prior to the Stroll. I asked the server “what are we eating today?” he told me “Squatch Wing Chili — It’s what happens when you take our world famous Squatch Wings, you take a bean chili, put on some sexy music, close the door…” Then he made the universal hand sign for hooking up. So, a funny and genuine Upstate NY interaction at a restaurant renowned in the Capital Region for great wings. Sadly, the chili was mid.

Soup #6 — Moraccan Roasted Carrot Soup with Spiced Apple Drizzle and Hazelnut Crunch at Simone’s Kitchen.  25 minute wait in line for the three-time reigning Soup Stroll champ. The experience was there, with a staffer standing by the line to explain the soup and answer any questions. The presentation was there (I mean, look at it). But while I voted for Simone’s in the “Most Instagrammable” category, this soup didn’t hold up to last year’s offering of cauliflower chowder (which is among the best bites of food I’ve ever had) and didn’t hold up to Center Street’s jerk chicken this year. But the people’s voices were heard, they loved the carrot soup, and Simone’s retained the belt by becoming the 2025 Soup Stroll “Souperstar”!

What did I learn? That I’m glad I keep hand warmers in my car to hand out to panhandlers, because I needed some yesterday. I learned I need to get to Backstage Pub next year (they placed in every category with their brisket soup). And I learned neighboring city Amsterdam HELD THEIR 6TH ANNUAL “SOUPFEST” ON THE SAME DAY—STEP OFF IT, AMSTERDAM!!!

1iawmpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iawmpf/the_streams_bride/,The Stream's Bride,"When I was little, from the ages of 6-13, my family and I lived in a house in a country town in California. It was an acre of land surrounded by wilderness with no neighbors for about 5 miles in any direction. While my brother, Ryan, and I had things like TV and video games, we spent most of our time exploring and playing in that stretch of wilderness. 

The land surrounding the property was classic California chaparral; rolling, sunbaked hills covered in a mix of shrubs and low standing trees with the occasional oak or pine sprouting out over the sea of green, yellow and brown. We had diverse wildlife; red tail hawks, condors, diamondbacks, coyotes, and raccoons, to name a few. Looking back, it’s a wonder our parents ever let us venture out there alone. They definitely had more of a hands off approach when it came to us, though we did tell them we never went further than half a mile which was a lie. Our days consisted of scaling rocks, exploring canyons, and attempting to catch lizards and bugs. 

Though it was beautiful, outside of rocks, shrubs, and trees, there wasn’t all that much out there to be seen. Except for one thing. Deep into the wilderness, by a stream that trickled down a ravine between 2 hills, was the wreckage of an old car. It was difficult to say what type or make, as many of its parts were scattered and broken. Its front was planted into the side of one of the hills and most of the rest of the car could be seen nearby. Rusty metal and old, deflated tires had begun to sink into the mud and sand of the stream’s bank.

Of course, neither of us knew how it got there or why it had been abandoned. But naturally, we treated it like a playground, jumping off of the roof and splashing into the stream, hitting it with sticks, or throwing rocks through the already broken windows until we ran out of energy. After that, we sat by the stream and theorized about the car, spinning our own stories of its past. We had several: the car was haunted, a trap left here by monsters to lure people to it, or that it was from another dimension entirely. My brother suggested the owners of the car must have been gangsters who crashed into the ravine while escaping the police. What’s more, their drug money was surely still hidden somewhere nearby. 

Although a childish fantasy, the idea of buried treasure was too alluring to resist, and we spent many long afternoons digging around the stream, looking under rocks, and checking behind tree trunks in hopes of finding some bandit’s forgotten riches. Though our search usually only turned up the occasional old beer can, it became a game to us. Over the course of 3 summers, we must have combed through every square inch of that wilderness. 

I remember one summer in particular, when I was around 9 years old. Ryan had gotten the flu and, as such, was stuck inside. To my great dismay, I had no one to go exploring with anymore. I asked my parents how long it would take for the flu to pass and they told me a week or 2. Being a 9 year old, 2 weeks was an eternity. But disappointment quickly turned into selfish excitement: I decided I’d go alone to find the bandit’s treasure, stealing all of the glory and riches for myself. 

To give some context, my brother had always been a sleepwalker. My mom or dad would often find him sitting downstairs on the couch or standing in the kitchen at late hours of the night, eyes still closed. They’d gently lead him back to bed, attempting not to wake him. I don’t remember from where, but it had been ingrained in me that you shouldn’t wake a sleep walker. So when the night came that I was the one who found him sleepwalking, I was determined not to. 

It was a little bit after midnight and the Santa Ana winds were rattling the walls and windows, keeping me up. In frustration, I got out of bed and went down to the kitchen for some water. I trudged along the dark hallway, down the stairs and into the room that separated the kitchen from the living room. I turned to the living room and my heart stopped for a brief moment. Ryan was sitting on the couch, fast asleep. Though he was asleep, he was sitting straight up, peering out the window into the darkness through closed eyes. 

I ignored him, continuing on to the kitchen. After finishing my drink, I returned to the living room to get Ryan back to bed. I figured that his sickness was just making his sleepwalking a little bit worse. But when I looked, Ryan wasn’t there anymore. The living room was empty. I checked back upstairs in Ryan’s bed only to find that it too was empty. I was considering waking my parents when I spotted him. He was standing outside on the porch overlooking the slope that led outside of our yard. Even with the porch light on, the wilderness was a looming, thick darkness that consumed any light from the house. I immediately went to go get him, not caring about waking him at this point. I was cold and tired, my frustration at having this chore forced on me was evident as I yanked on his arm, turning him to me. Speaking in a state like this also wasn’t uncommon for Ryan. He’d mumble nonsensical phrases about cartoons we had watched, games we played, or whatever he was dreaming of. But the words that came out of his mouth this time were crystal clear, and they made my blood run cold. He lifted his arm out slowly, pointing into the blackness ahead of us.

“She’s looking for you.”

His nose began to bleed. A thin trail of red dripping from one of his nostrils. 

Fueled by fear, I sprinted to my parents room and shook them. Out of breath, my explanation must not have made sense to them. But I was able to get the words ‘Ryan’ and ‘outside’ across to them. They followed me downstairs to the living room. Ryan was still outside, again facing the wilderness. They scolded me for not bringing him inside before going out, scooping him up, and carrying him into the house. Even now, I have no idea how he had stayed asleep through this. The wind outside was moving fast enough to kick up dust that stung as it peppered my skin. I didn’t sleep that night.

That morning, I went to my parents in another attempt to explain what had happened. I was still at the age where my parents were the ultimate authority and seemed all-knowing. So when they told me that the fever aggravated Ryan’s sleepwalking, I didn’t question it. Still, I was unsettled and tired enough that I decided my solo treasure hunt could wait a day. I spent the majority of that day sleeping.

The next day, I set out early in the morning with a sense of purpose. I went over the rocky, shrub littered path our repeated trips had carved into the foliage until I made it to the stream. The day was almost silent, save for the wind in the leaves and the trickle of water over mud and sand.

The car had become a familiar sight at this point, and we had given it somewhat of a personality. It was more than just wreckage to us, but a private and almost sacred place that only my brother and I knew about. I sat on one of the old tires, the bottom half of which was submerged in sand, to rest.

In my childish state of excitement for treasure hunting, I had not considered the possibility of fear or danger. But sitting there by myself, with steep, overgrown slopes on either side of me, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I shouldn’t be there. The old car now gave off a feeling of forbiddance and the rustling of the leaves no longer sounded innocent. The air itself felt heavy, the same feeling that happens right before a disaster. As if everything around me was collectively holding its breath. 

My thoughts immediately, and involuntarily, shifted to the events of the night before. Ryan's words repeated in my mind,

“She’s looking for you.”

Every instinct I had was telling me that I was being watched. I was filled with the panicked need to flee, to be anywhere else. And so, I ran as fast as my legs could carry me back up the hill and away from the car. I dashed through bushes, ignoring the trail in a straight line to my house, to safety. Brambles cut my arms, face and legs, but I didn’t feel anything outside of the overwhelming fear that encompassed me.

As I ran, the tempo of my feet hitting the earth was interrupted by another set of footsteps. Footsteps that were heavier than mine, and rapidly growing nearer from behind me. Whether or not this was the imagination of a child or not, fresh panic filled my veins that gave me speed I didn’t know I was capable of. I didn't dare look behind me. My brother and I surely had been right, some beast had lured me out here and now was taking the opportunity I had given it to devour me. 

I clambered over the last rocky hill, tears staining the dust beneath me. I sobbed with relief when at the sound of my father’s voice calling for me. I had made it to the house. At some point in my desperate flight, the footsteps had vanished. But it didn’t matter to me. I hopped under the yard fence and sprinted to my father, clinging to his leg in fear.

Through tears and sobs I choked out a child’s explanation of what had happened. He scolded me for going out into the wilderness alone but I didn’t care. I never wanted to set foot out there again.  The rest of my day was spent inside with my sick brother. I told him about what had happened too but he didn’t believe me, instead accusing me of trying to hog all the treasure for myself. 

The rest of the day, I attempted to distract myself with the new Nintendo my parents had bought us for my birthday. Night time came and by then I had successfully calmed down. My parents had convinced me that I had just been scared by my own imagination. That the sounds I had heard weren’t real. This soothed me to the point that I was able to push my fears out of my mind. Honestly, I wanted them to be right. I fell asleep quickly, all the panic and running taking its toll on me. 

Over the next few days, I stayed within the confines of the yard, not daring to go back out to the wilderness. But days became weeks and the fear I felt began to fade. After all, all that had happened was I imagined some noises and caught my brother sleepwalking. I kept telling myself this, trying to build up the courage to go back out to the place by the stream. But every time I approached the fence at the edge of our yard, I would stop and look out to what waited ahead. The wall of trees and shrubs on the other side felt unusually ominous, as if they were waiting for me. And in those moments, no amount of rationalizing could overcome my own senses telling me to not take another step. 

By now, Ryan’s flu had passed and he was ready to continue our game of treasure hunting. I, of course, refused and adamantly argued for us to stay inside, or at least within the border of the property. But Ryan always knew how to get what he wanted from me. He taunted me with all sorts of names, saying I was just too chicken and that, when he found the money, he’d keep it for himself. I, again, being young, let my pride and frustration overwhelm my sense of paranoia. 

This trip was far slower than my last. Despite my brave face, I walked behind my brother the entire time, coiled and ready to flee at the first sign of trouble. Like last time, the setting itself felt hostile and cold. As if we were foreign invaders, a virus in the bloodstream of a far greater organism. After about 30 minutes of painful, suspense-filled hiking, we reached the car. My brother, aware of my fear, teased and mocked me for being so scared of a place we had been to so many times before. To prove his point, and to further prod at me, he kicked the trunk of the old car. The sound reverberated up through the canyon; a loud, metallic thud.

I froze, breath held, waiting for something to happen. Surely something had heard that. Whatever it was that had chased me would come bursting through the foliage and swallow us both whole. Even Ryan’s confidence seemed to falter for a bit, his cocky smile fading. We stood there, looking around the canyon, for what felt like hours. But nothing ever happened. No monsters, no running, nothing. This quickly restored my brother's confidence, who didn’t stop making fun of my cowardice for the rest of the day. Although gingerly, I followed along as we explored the wilderness, as we always had done. And later that afternoon, we returned safely home. I was relieved. This proved that my fears had been unfounded and foolish, just like Ryan had said. 

That night, I had the most vivid dream I’ve ever had, even to date. I was still in my bed, it was before dawn and the sun hadn’t peaked over the hills yet, but the pitch black of night had become a dark blue. I shared a room with Ryan. To give a better picture, my bed was in line with the door which led out to a long hallway that connected to both the stairs and to my parents room. In my dream, I could see a figure standing in the hallway facing my room, facing me. It was too dark to see its face at first. The figure walked silently down the rest of the hallway, stopping at my door. I was too scared to move or make any sound. From here, I could make out some details. It was a woman in a wedding dress. Her face was covered by a long veil. The once white cloth was grey and rotten. One hand on the doorframe, she leaned into view, peering at my bed. Neither of us moved and there was no sound for what felt like forever. She brought her other hand to her chin, slowly pulling the veil over her face and behind her hair, revealing a sight I can never forget.

Her skin was slick, as if water constantly ran down from her hair. Her face was green and grey with rot. Patches of flesh were missing, revealing pink meat and yellowing bone. Her mouth hung open in a silent scream, revealing a grey, shriveled tongue preceding the black abyss of her throat. She had no eyes, only dark sockets where they once had been. All the same, I knew she was looking at me. Still, I didn’t dare move. My body wouldn’t let me. We stayed there, holding each other's gaze for another painful eternity. 

I woke up in my bed as the sun hit my eyes. My brother was already downstairs and my parents were drinking coffee in the front yard. I decided to ignore my nightmare and join my brother, the daylight giving me confidence. I wasn’t going to let a nightmare spoil my Saturday. I jumped out of bed and began down the hall. But I stopped, my skin tingling as the feeling of cold, damp carpet met my feet just outside of my door frame.

Everything was going fine (minus my own mental struggles but nothing super crazy) until I developed chronic illness. Me becoming physically ill turned my ex into the most evil person ever, and I’m not just saying that in a BPD split way. They were horrible. When I was getting diagnosed with my chronic illness, all they said was “This is too much for me”. 

They decided to chose partying over me and were getting upset with me while I was going through the worst point in my life because I physically wasn’t able to party and do substances with them. They compared me to their able bodied friends and would make constant comments to me about how their friends thought I was a bad girlfriend, and then I found out recently that my ex didn’t even tell their friends that Im sick and can’t even leave my bed most days, and let their friends push this narrative that I was this evil, unavailable partner when the whole time I was just sick. During a break where we were still trying to fix things, they cheated on me twice. 

I was still sticking with them and letting them in my life because I’m at a point where I don’t have any support system. I’m sick, I can’t work, I have nobody and I’m stuck in a very toxic household I need to get out of. All I had was them, but today we went to a coffee shop and I saw one of the people they cheated on me with and something clicked. I started sobbing and told them to take me home, I blocked them on everything on the car ride back and I think I’m finally done, at least I hope so. I don’t know what to do now.

It’s not that he is bad or treating me bad directly. He is genuinely a nice person, doesn’t treat anyone bad. I just think that he has to figure things out for himself first, and that has nothing to do with me. In these 5 months, there has been 2 times he broke things off, and I respected his decision, giving him the space he wanted to, and both times he came back some days later saying that he regretted that, and that he’s just scared to be hurt again, he has trust issues, and he felt scared when he started to get close with me so his instinctive reaction was to get away. As a human being I respect his feelings and I completely get where he’s coming from. It’s just that as a girlfriend it kinda puts me in a difficult situation, because I deserve to be with someone that is emotionally available for me. I decided that I wanna give things a try. But, 2 months have passed from that, and he still appears kinda distant. I know that it’s kinda selfish, but I can’t help but feel unwanted. Also, him leaving and coming back again twice makes me overthink a lot of things, like when I notice him acting differently or being distant. I know that is an issue of mine and I don’t wanna blame him because after all I made the decision to give things a try again. It’s just I deeply know that I feel things for him, I fell in love with him but he clearly isn’t feeling the same. I can tell that he enjoys spending time together and he likes to talk to me, I just know that he isn’t feeling things for me. I can see. He looks at me more with lust, not genuinely, not with love or anything. There is no deep connection between us and it’s one sided. I have confessed my feelings to him, and he said something along the lines of “yea I figured out you feel that, I can tell by the way you look at me”. And yea basically that’s somehow my dilemma. I feel that it’s best to let things go, but it’s not that easy because I have developed all these feelings, and it’s not that he did something very bad to me making me hate him or something. And it’s making me sad..

Editing now after posting: I wanted to add some things as some examples of what I mean. I wanted to give him a special present for Christmas, so I went and bought him a silver bracelet, since he already has a watch and I figured out it would match. I wanted to also make a handmade gift along with that, like these diy boxes you see on TikTok that girls draw with paint different stuff and put candy etc inside. And I drew the outside, was gonna finish this project and my impatient self couldn’t wait so I told him about what I’m planning and he said that I am cringe, in a nicely way. Like that I am weird. I know that it’s cheesy to do something like that I get it, it’s just that he expressed many times that he never gotten gifts or any surprises from other ppl and from ex girlfriends so I thought that even if this was cringe at least we could laugh about it together and he would appreciate the move. Thank god I told him too in the end because I ended up never mentioning it again and gave this to my mom which she loved it..

And another example is that he had an exam for his university, 1.5 hour away from our town, and he suggested if I wanted to come since the exam would take max 30 minutes, and then we could go have a coffee and explore the other town his uni is at. I accepted it, and I made up my schedule according this hang out. Late at night, the day before he started going on about that he doesn’t think it’s a good idea, that it’s fine and that I don’t have to wake up to go. I told him that I don’t mind and like the idea. Idk, he was kinda persistent about how it would be a big inconvenience for me, even tho I reassured it’s not. I just said that it’s ok then. In the end he told me that “if I want to go I can go” . I don’t get this as an invitation, imo. You don’t make someone feel invited when you tell them this. I just brushed it off. He said that we can do this another day, on another exam. His next exams came up tho but he never suggested anything so I let things be.

Our mom has always told us our real dad’s name is (fake name) John. She gave us his last name even though the paternity test came back negative shortly after we were born. This was confirmed by my aunts. We had to do a family tree project for school when we were little and she made us call our “dad’s” parents. They both started yelling at us that we weren’t there’s and told our mom to be truthful. She still kept up the lie for all these years. My sister called John when we were in our 20s and he also stated the test was negative and said sorry. 

My sister decided to try ancestry.com 6 years ago. She never got any matches, but we continued to check it every so often. Something told me to check it last night and there it was.. a 20% match with an uncle or half brother from last week. We did some major digging and found who we thought was our half brother. Turns out the matches brother is our dad and remembers my mom. She never told him. I don’t know why she did it and she will never tell us. I’m happy we finally found him, but I also feel insanely stressed out right now. He’s super kind and very excited to meet us. He actually has another set of twin daughters 7 years younger than us so I’m excited about that as well. But I can’t help but feel leery and anxious. It’s completely consumed my sister and I since last night. I’m meeting him this weekend for coffee and a paternity test lol. I really hope it goes well. I’m so grateful for ancestry.com!

For some reason chemex gets so much hate but I have tried the v60 and kalita wave and I can’t get a coffee as good as the chemex 3 cup. 

I’m using a fellow kettle, I brew light roasts so usually around 205f water. Small doses around 13-16 grams of coffee. Filters are always same brand as its dripper. D54 grinder. 

I have tried using the Tetsu and Lance Hendricks recipes for the v60. So I have tried going coarse, and also fine. I have tried similar recipes on the Kalita wave. 

I returned the kalita wave very fast, the v60 I really want to like, so I am keeping it. The coffee always comes out in the exact parameters for time for all the recipes I try, so I know my grind size, and water temp is ballpark. Why does the coffee always come out tasting bland, over extracted and watery at the same time. 

Could it be I am just used to the chemex brew style?

2024 was definitely the hardest year of my life, and it's continued into 2025. I always have enjoyed wine, but after I had a hard loss at the start of 2024, I started to rely on wine. At first, it was a couple of glasses a night, but it has now turned into a bottle and a half each night. 

I truly look forward to when it's 4, and I feel it's acceptable to drink wine, but I know that's a problem. I know how it's making my anxiety worse. Ageing me. Making me escape, instead of really dealing with what's going on. 

  
My question is - how do you stop? I still don't have enough ""will,"" because it's one of my favorite parts of the day. I just get to ""chill"" - like I'm not as on edge. I can relax. I can numb out.

I used to be very much into yoga, working out, and spirituality... but even those things, it's like I can't tap into it.

It's wake up, drink coffee and then once that's done, drink water, and then it's time for wine. Time to escape.

Another thing, I just love drinking - anything. Coffee, water, sparkling water, etc. But it feels unnatural to drink those things at night.

I don't know. I'm just looking for advice as to how you FINALLY stopped. What helped you. What you supplemented alcohol with. Because I need to lessen it, but I just can't seem to have the will or motivation to. ",2,1737941489.0,stopdrinking,4,1.0,False

In the span of a few mere months I lost my Dad to a tragic accident, my kids lost their dad to a drunk driver (happily divorced but co-parenting), my beautiful, protective German Shepherd died unexpectedly and the next day my coworker and friend of 25 years passed. A month later my partner of 15 years decided to leave our family. No reason, other than he just realized his own mortality after “surviving “ covid”. He had a cough for three days, poor guy.

I spent a few  years in a big old pity party. Left with the money pit of a house, flailing business, along with children and grandchildren to take care of, it has taken me to the depths of despair and back.

Life turned a beautiful corner when I decided to let go of my suffering. Now, everywhere I go it’s the strangest thing. People are coming up to me, initiating conversations, and engaging in friendly banter. My energy I put out to the world is warm, loving and inviting rather than sad, cold and dejected. 

Conversations take place in the most random way.  I go through the drive-through and the person in front of me is buying my coffee or lunch. Everything is on an upward trajectory since I focused less on my pain and offering my support to others. 

One thing I can say is that I’ve come out of my sorrow and become more aware and sensitive to the suffering of others. I choose to walk with a smile on my face rather than a frown. if I don’t take a moment to look beyond my suffering and offer my hand to others, I would stay stuck in my own pain. 

This morning I went to grab a coffee and it was -10 Celsius. A young man was running down the street in a T-shirt trying to get home. I circled the block, wondering if I should stop for a total stranger running down the street. I’m glad I  did. He was afraid, embarrassed, cold and in need of help. Life had done him a dirty. He needed help. And life just keeps teaching you a lesson. Love your neighbour. 

Although it has been a painful and difficult season, I’ve come to realize, hardships are an inevitable part of life and love your neighbour, for everyone is struggling in their own way.  Tragedy is inevitable, suffering is optional.

Had 2 dates with this girl, they seemed to go well, and had a feeling for once that this may actually go somewhere other than casually seeing each other and nothing more.  

On the day of our 3rd date, her car battery died 5 hours before our date, AAA took 2 hours to pickup her car to go to Autozone for a new battery.  Then, 2 hours before our date, she messaged me paragraphs. 

Basically, she explained that she really likes me quite a bit, but it wouldn’t be fair to me to be in a relationship with her right now as she has some issues going on at the moment in her life such as not having time for things, she’s a teacher, so I totally get it, and it seems her mom relies on her quite a bit, she hasn’t even been seeing her friends.  When she explained this, she said she doesn’t want this to be the end, and asked for me to be around when she’s ready as she wants to be with me when she’s mentally ready.  4 days after this, we met for a coffee at Starbucks, and she talked my ear off for hours, even telling me things she never “told anyone else before”, mentioned she has a movie pass and asked if I want to see movies with her.  

After Starbucks, we went over to Target in the same parking lot and grocery shopped together.  We got distracted by good smelling colognes & perfumes, I said 1 of the perfumes smelled really good and she said “of course that’s one of the perfumes I haven’t got yet”.  She walked with me to my car, unloaded my groceries with me, then I walked her to hers, and helped unload hers.  When she opened her car door to get into her car, she looked at me and said “I just had a moment but I’m not quite there yet, I did have fun though and really like you”.  I said “yeah, I get it, have fun grading your papers over the weekend” and left.  I kept the communication the day after very light, and didn’t text her right after meeting up.  Today, she told me she bought a new perfume she’s been wanting, I showed her a pic of my cologne as I said I would, and she said “you have some sexy scents” and we flirted a tiny bit.  

It feels like I’ve been put into a temporary friend zone until she’s ready?  Ideally for me, for someone to be my girlfriend, I want to feel comfortable around them first and know them really well, so I don’t mind the pace this is going.  

However, I’m used to kissing and stuff, while getting to know each other, while working towards possibly being in a relationship later on, and that’s not happening at the moment as she doesn’t want to until she’s ready.  

I’ve decided to keep my options open, and I’d let her know what’s going on when she’s ready, or before, am I playing my cards right here? ",0,1737941410.0,dating_advice,1,0.5,False

1iaw6r3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iaw6r3,Bean 🫘 feedback! Eight O’Clock coffee Dark Italian Espresso is damn good 👍,"I’ve recently started grinding my own beans in a burr coffee grinder and refilling the pods with a Capmesso. I can make about 70ish pods with a 2 lb bag at around $15 which is less than .25 cents a cup. Most recent bag purchase was (Eight O’ Clock Dark Italian Espresso) beans. Absolutely fantastic, one of the darkest most robust roasts I’ve ever had. Made both Double shots 2.7oz and Coffee 7.7oz in espresso fine and drip fine grinds respectfully. Drink mostly iced lattes and hot coffees with cream in our house. Had to play around a few pods till I got the grind for each size dialed in and 😋🤯. 

Tasting Notes:

It has a strong aroma like seriously whoa, Rich Chocolate flavor, malty, deep, smooth, velvety, and more chocolate with a light charred caramel finish and perfect crema amount. 

Stronger than any pod I’ve tried that’s for sure and maybe even coffee in general. First time my wife had one she sighed. Full size coffees are very robust and remind me a bit of strong camping ⛺️ coffee. No noticeable loss of flavor  with double shot espresso pods when made over ice and cream either.

I’m currently working on my master’s thesis, and I’d love to get your insights! My research aims to develop a **taxonomy** (similar to Weking et al., 2020) categorizing **AI applications used by VCs** throughout the investment process—from **deal sourcing** to **exit**.

To build a robust foundation, I’m analyzing the tools currently in use and gathering direct input from VCs. Your experience would be incredibly valuable to me!

👉 It would be amazing if you could share your thoughts on the following:

1. **What AI tools are you currently using?**
   * At which stage of the investment process do you use them (e.g., deal sourcing, due diligence, portfolio management)?
2. **What AI tools have you used in the past but abandoned—and why?**
   * Were there specific limitations, challenges, or unmet expectations that led to this decision?
3. **Do you exclusively use third-party applications, or do you also build custom AI solutions tailored to your needs using APIs?**
   * If you build your own, what were the key drivers for this decision (e.g., cost, flexibility, data privacy)?
4. **What are the key benefits of the AI tools you use for your workflow?**
   * For example, do they improve **speed**, **efficiency**, **accuracy**, or **collaboration**?
5. **What challenges have you faced when implementing or using AI tools?**
   * For instance, **integration issues**, **cost barriers**, or **lack of functionality**.
6. **What criteria do you consider most important when evaluating and acquiring AI tools?**
   * Examples: **price**, **ease of integration**, **specific features**, **vendor support**, or **scalability**.
7. **What is your VC firm’s AI strategy for the next 3 years?**
   * Are you planning to expand your use of AI tools, adopt emerging technologies, or focus on in-house solutions?

💬 If you’re open to a **30-minute relaxed video interview over coffee**, feel free to PM me. I’d love to dive deeper into your experience!

As a thank you, I’ll share the final results of my thesis here. Hopefully, the taxonomy will help others navigate the growing “AI jungle” in the VC world! 🌟

Thanks so much for your input—it means the world to me! 🙏

I've not been a huge fan of the focus on decoration and crafting in New Horizons, but I don't necesarrily think they were bad features or anything, so I hope they return in the next game. I do wish they focus more on the ""non-decorative"" aspects of the game, but while still giving those players the ability to do so freely. So for a little bit too long I've thought up a little story, while not focusing on the gameplay itself, which I think will incorporate many of the different things players would want from a game.

----------------------------------------------

You wake up to the sound of waves, interrupted by a whole lot of questions from a very curious cat who had just decided to seat himself down in front of you on the ferry. Rover the cat asks you about why you're traveling, and to where exactly, and when you tell him, his eyes light up. ""That's the next harbor!"", he says, before he talks about how it is a cute little coastal town, but how it sadly has had a declining population over the years. When he finds out that you haven't gotten a house there yet, he quickly leaves to call an old friend who lives there, before he gets back right in time for the bells to ring and a voice through the speakers tells you that you'll be arriving there shortly. ""Maybe a weird one like yourself could help bring back some life to this old town?"", he chuckles, and walks away.

At the harbor, you meet Tom Nook, who from a short phone call with Rover had found out that you didn't have a house, which he'd gladly help you out with. The two of you make it through town, all the way over to Nook's homes, where he hands you a tent that you can place wherever you want youe house to be, while he handles the paperwork. After you've set it up, you get back to Nook's, ready to tell him that you don't have a single bell in your account. 

Paying down a house loan without any money is a difficult task, but Tom Nook is solution-oriented, and makes a deal with you where you can work for him and his nephews until the loan is paid down. As you deliver packages from the post office to Timmy and Tommy, help adding a new coat of paint to the town hall, and many other small jobs, you get to know both the town and its inhabitants, and the weird situation they're in...

Isabelle, the previous secretary, tells you that a little bit before you arrived in town, their mayor had resigned with immediate effect, and moved away to a tropical island and never spoke a word to them since. Isabelle had to take on the role of mayor, but you can see that it's been stressing her out, and she says herself that she's a much better fit for secretary. 

Your house loan is paid down, and you're now free to do whatever you want (and go further into debt by upgrading your house)! This doesn't mean that you're finished working though! The small quiet town which used to buzzle with life, is now quiet and forgotten, with only a little museum, a convenience store,a clothing shop, Nook's homes, and an old run down building, which apparently used to be a café. What can be done to get some life back in town? Planting flowes and shrubs, decorating the island with different items and paths, helps, but there needs to be done more.

You will for the most part be talking with your neigbours, pick and sell fruit, go fishing or bug catching and donate what you've caught to the museum, but sometimes you might get asked if you'd want to help out with their work. Maybe Pete could need some extra help delivering mail? As the days go on the town becomes more and more prosperous, a couple of people will come to visit, and reveal to you that they're interested in setting up shop.

You help them out picking the locations, and soon there will be a bunch of small shops scattered around time. Some of these will be expanded as you spend bells there, and some of these store owners will from time to time ask you if you'd like to help out with work. Helping out at the newly renovated ""The Roost"" is a great opportunity to get to know both the residents in town, and what their coffee preferences are. 

The days go on and you'll partake in bug-offs, fishing tourneys, fetsivals and holidays, but all the time there's been word of a coming election. There is still the problem of nobody actually wanting to be mayor though, so do you think you could be fit for mayor? 

After moving to this quiet town, the villagers are in huge favor of you taking the role of mayor, since you've helped bringing more people there, and just made it a much nicer town to be in. So you decide to run for mayor, and now all we can do is to sit and wait for election night.

The election results are in... and as the only candidate you win by a landslide! From now on you'll be able to implement town ordinances, start public work projects, relocate and change the appearance of different buildings, and lastly the ability to terraform.

----------------------------------------------

I'm sure there's a good ammount of flaws with this, but I feel like this could be a really cute consept for a next installment in the series. It might be a bit too dragged out, which makes replaying it with the sole purpose of creating a different town quite tedious, but I think it adds a nice bit of diversity to each day, for the average player. I didn't really think all too much about mechanics and gameplay features, and instead about the setting and an overall storyline.

Anyway, some very heated words were exchanged, and it ended up me threatening divorce and throwing the wedding ring I gave him with my name and our kids names engraved on it in the trash. He then out of nowhere shoved me hard straight into the washing machine. I was holding a coffee cup, and I slammed against the washing machine, and coffee got everywhere. He told me to ""clean it up you %$#^ slob"" and called me ""a %&# piece of $%@&"" . Our 1 year old.daughter saw the whole thing and got.scared. 

I tried to apologize later, clearly things got heated and out of hand. He told me to stop victimizing myself and that I'm abusive, and I'm probably having an affair because why else would I act like this and it's too late to apologize.  

He has left for the day and at this point I don't know what to do.  I don't have any evidence of all this. I was thinking of filing a police report in case something like this happens again and I need to get custody of my kids,  but I am nervous he will file one against me because I have said some pretty mean things over text. 

I am honestly feeling a little scared to be around him, and nervous when he gets home. I'm also surprised he hasn't apologized and thought I deserved that. Maybe I did. This is the first time in our 10 years together he has done something like this. Part of me feels like I pushed him to this place. 

I am also afraid the police report will affect his ability to get a job, he is currently underemployed which is a huge source of fighting and together or not I need him to share child support of our 3 kids",3,1737940859.0,domesticviolence,0,0.8,False

I was also sober and he was mostly sober. He was really interested in me but thought I didn't like him, so I just decided to ask for his number. He was shocked (in a good way) then became really happy. 

So we start texting and I ask to meet for coffee. He enthusiastically says yes. But the next day I ask when he's free and no response... 

I really like him but idk if I should double text or not. Like how long do I wait? Or should I even double text at all? (Its been over a day). 

Also, though no response, he follows me on Instagram now?? Idk, I think it's weird. But I like him so I'm curious for some thoughts.

She's widowed twice and she gets social security, but when I talk to her about retirement living places or low income, she says that those places aren't up to her standard of living or she doesn't want to go. The thing is, there's too much stuff in this apartment with our combined stuff. We moved in here after my stepdad passed and she lost her house, so this was supposed to be temporary and at some point I want a house. People keep saying to get a big enough house for both of us and I've thought about that, but I just want my own space. Whenever I go on a date with someone from before, she makes comments like ""where'd you dig him up?"" And I can't really have overnight dates at the moment because she sleeps in my room and I sleep on the couch. She was in the twin bed in the office, but it was too rough on her back. She moved into my bed when I was staying with an ex all the time and the big TV is in the living room, so for the most part I don't mind sleeping in here. But it's annoying not having my place to myself at times. Like, on Sundays. I like football, but I'm not gonna necessarily watch it all day like she does at times. And I've had to clean up after her multiple times; she gets coffee stains on the counter every day. I even told her the other day that she could apply for Section 8 and get a unit in this very building, so we can be close, but she gets mad when I bring it up. We have a lot of fun together watching Housewives shows and telling each other jokes and I like having her here to talk about my day or get advice. I just want her in another unit lol. She keeps saying ""if my mother was alive, I'd be glad to move her into a house with me"". And it's not like I don't do anything for her. I drive her around when she can't drive, make sure she has her meds, take care of food, etc. And she contributes the few times I need help with a bill due to a temporary layoff or something.

1iavwet,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1iavwet/reborn_to_love/,Reborn To Love,"Story Description:
Haunted by vivid dreams of a tragic love story set centuries ago, journalist Livia Harper feels an unshakable connection to a man she’s never met—until she encounters Ethan Ward, a reserved historian who seems eerily familiar. Drawn together by fate, their undeniable chemistry stirs memories of a love long lost to time.

When Livia turns to past-life regression therapy, she uncovers a shocking truth: she was Isabelle D’Armont, a noblewoman torn between duty and love during the tumultuous French Revolution. Her soulmate, Sebastian Devereaux, was a revolutionary leader whose life ended in betrayal and heartbreak. Now, in the present, echoes of their past reemerge, threatening to repeat the same tragedy.

As Livia and Ethan delve deeper into her memories, they uncover a centuries-old secret that ties their souls together—and a modern rival determined to tear them apart. With time running out, Livia must confront her past, embrace her present, and fight for the second chance at love she’s been given.

Can love truly transcend lifetimes, or will history repeat itself?

Reborn to Love is a heart-stirring tale of reincarnation, romance, and redemption that spans centuries, blending the beauty of timeless love with the thrill of unraveling hidden truths.

Chapter 1: Dreams of the Past

The cobblestones beneath my feet were slick with rain, each step a frantic echo in the labyrinth of dark alleys. The night reeked of smoke and fear, the distant screams of revolution closing in.

“Isabelle!” His voice—deep, desperate—cut through the chaos, pulling me back.

I spun around, my breath hitching. There he was. Sebastian Devereaux. His face was shadowed but unmistakable, etched with determination. I ran toward him, my hand outstretched. Just as our fingers brushed, a sharp, searing pain bloomed in my chest.

I gasped.

The world blurred, his shout becoming a distant roar.

When I woke, my heart was pounding, and my shirt clung to my sweat-soaked skin. I clutched my chest, the phantom ache still fresh as if I’d truly been pierced by some invisible blade.

That dream again.

For weeks, it had haunted me—Sebastian, the chase, and that terrible, final moment. I didn’t know who he was or why I kept seeing him. All I knew was that it felt too vivid to be just a dream.

My phone buzzed on the nightstand, its sharp vibration shattering the eerie stillness. I groaned, swiping at the screen.

“Where’s the article? Deadline’s today!”

Nothing like my boss’s texts to remind me that my life wasn’t a historical drama—it was a treadmill of deadlines and mediocre coffee.

“Great,” I muttered, tossing the phone aside.

I spent the morning staring blankly at my laptop, trying to summon the energy to finish my article. But the dream lingered like an itch I couldn’t scratch. By lunchtime, I gave up. The moment I stepped outside, a poster caught my eye:

“Revolution and Love: France’s Forgotten Heroes.”

The title sent a shiver down my spine. Before I knew it, my feet were carrying me through the museum doors.

The exhibit was quiet, save for the hushed voices of a few visitors. I wandered aimlessly until a painting stopped me cold.

It was him.

Sebastian.

The man from my dreams stood tall in the artwork, defiant, as though daring anyone to look away. A noose hung ominously behind him.

I couldn’t breathe.

“You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

The voice startled me, and I turned quickly. My breath caught again.

Standing there was the living, breathing version of the man in the painting—Sebastian. Or at least, someone who looked exactly like him. His sharp jawline, piercing eyes, everything matched. But this man wasn’t wearing the threadbare clothes of a revolutionary. He was in a tailored suit, holding a leather-bound notebook.

“I… I’m sorry,” I stammered.

“Don’t be,” he said, his voice warm, calm. “Ethan Ward.” He extended a hand, and I stared at it for a beat too long before shaking it.

“Livia Harper,” I managed.

“You’re a journalist?” He gestured at the badge hanging from my neck.

“Yeah. You’re a historian?”

“Guilty.” His eyes flicked toward the painting. “This exhibit is my pet project, actually. The Revolution fascinates me.”

I opened my mouth to say something—anything—but nothing came. My heart hammered in my chest, my mind racing with questions I couldn’t ask. Why did he look so much like Sebastian? Why did I feel like I’d known him forever?

Ethan raised an eyebrow, his lips curving into a faint smile. “Are you alright?”

“I—yeah. Fine,” I lied, my hands trembling.

But I wasn’t fine.

Not when his face was the same one I’d been dreaming of for weeks.

And definitely not when my dreams always ended in blood.

This is the pinnacle of the trip, but of course I also want to have a fantastic experience together and make lots of memories.

I have also planned the usual suspects - Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Seine river cruise, canal cruise, shopping, dining and lots of croissants, coffee, snails and wine.  She wants to wander around in the Latin Quarter and Montmartre, and will definitely shop A LOT.

I do not want to overload our trip because I know she will enjoy wandering around like I do. However, I don't want to miss something that might be super special.

I am going to try and break everything down from each page and icons.  **\*NOTE\* All Icons are clickable.** ***This is not a kid's game!*** *A work in progress, will update as I unlock more, or people share tips!* 

***All links are screenshots***

[https://photos.app.goo.gl/7uYnoG7W1gnRVVXW8](https://photos.app.goo.gl/7uYnoG7W1gnRVVXW8)

When you first open the app, you get to create your account, choose your server then press start.

First tab is **Suburbs**, your little town that you're going to build up, but before we start on the shops, let's discuss the overlayed icons on your screen:

*Top Left*\- **Profile Picture Icon**\- click on it to open the Personal Info. Here you can see your current rank, which stores you've opened in green, and the ones you haven't in grey (you can scroll in that box). Below this is a **Person Icon** where you contact customer support and that'll open another window with different options. **Fashion** is unlocked by unlocking certain confidants later. **Decor** is where you decide which talent/confidant's picture you'd like to display as your icon. A title or avatar frame if you've received any. At the bottom of the Personal Info page is your information card, you can change your personal preferred in game name here as well as your picture card's chibi costume. (You obtain more as you gain higher ranks).

Going back to the **Suburbs** page....

*Left side of the screen under profile picture*:

The **Thumbs Up Icon** is displayed to show bonus earning from likes you've received or pranks if someone doesn't like you. (How dare they not like you!) You can like someone 10 times per day, by either hitting the return button on the likes tab or by visiting someone's home from their info page when you click on their picture.

**Little Face Icon** below that directs you to the game's discord

Below that... is the **Clipboard/Pen Icon** which opens surveys the creators send us to get feedback, and we get rewards upon completion.

And below that.... is an arrow that pulls an extra menu out where you can find an **Envelope** for mail, **Megaphone** for game announcements and a **Gear** for game settings.

*Top of the page from left to right*:

Your total current earnings, your current rank title, your gems (this game gives out gems so be sure to save those for special packages), and your available spending limit.

*Right side*:

Treasure Hunt is a place where you can gamble your gems away for useful items and the rare chance of a Referral Card that allows you to unlock rare talent/confidants. Gamble at your own risk.

Leaderboard shows the top ranks for your server that covers Earnings, Abilities, Intimacy and Guilds. It's also a great way to see what you may be lacking when you visit a high rank's profile. At the bottom of the rank page is a **Trophy Icon** where you collect rewards for earning milestones you reach; be sure you're collecting those freebies!

**Suburbs** bottom of page:

**Chibi Picture Icon** shows your current title rank and a percentage to the next level. Clicking on that icon opens up a roadmap of your levels and what they unlock. Sometimes you receive a new talent, a car, a shop, or just the level itself. If you click on the **Lock Icon** that goes into your next level, it'll tell you what you can do to obtain more fame.  At the bottom left of this page is your next shop to unlock; by clicking that, you can receive rewards upon completing things in that shop as a collection. **The Storybook Icon** called 'Tycoon Cheats' opens up to a mini roadmap of how to win at the game...if only it was that easy!

Below the Chibi icon is your **Task Bar**, completing each one helps you earn fame and gets you closer to the next rank!

To the right-side is the **Double Person Icon,** welcome to the friends' tab, here you can have up to 200 friends and send 10daily gifts. You can see who's on and even send them direct private messages. At the top right is a tiny **Person/Gear Icon** where you can either block scary stalkers or delete friends.

Next to the friends' icon, is another **Task List**, but this one grants a daily number of gems instead of fame.

Below all that is the **Chat Bar**. By clicking here, you have access to World, Guild, Resort, Private Messages.



\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Before we discuss shops, let's do the 3 icons in the middle of the map.*** [***https://photos.app.goo.gl/BbhMzRqN6QdDswVA8***](https://photos.app.goo.gl/BbhMzRqN6QdDswVA8)

**Building Icon**\- click this to open your home, you start out in a basement cause you're broke, just shy of homeless, but you have big dreams! Sadly, you can't decorate this area, so it'll always just be a painful memory of your beginnings. You can however decorate your Living Room & Bedroom.

At the top left of either of those screens, is a **Reward Icon**, looks like a wardrobe; those come from status rank, earnings and factory level. In the **Furniture City Icon** (looks like a storage shed), you can purchase new and rare furniture, you get 20 furniture coins a day as a freebee.

Top right is another **Chibi Icon** that features the coziness level of your home, as you unlock more furniture.

Bottom right is the **Message Board Icon** (looks like a Clipboard), people visiting your home can leave you personalized notes here.

Under that is the **Furniture Icon** (looks like a paint roller). When you acquire new furniture, this is where you equip it into your home. The ranks are *green-common, blue- rare, purple- super rare, orange super, super rare.* You want to unlock everything you can and upgrade duplicates, but only place the higher ranked one, whether that be by color or what grants more percentage to traits.

\--------------------------------------------------

**Confidant Icon**\- Opening this shows all your current confidants, you can select at the top how you want them displayed, by default or by intimacy level. When you scroll towards the bottom, you can see the ones you're missing and if you click on one, it'll show towards the bottom right, how to obtain it. 

Bottom of the page left to right:

**Shop Icon**\- shows shop earning bonuses         

**Book Icon**\- shows the 'Roster of Fame' better known as confidant fame reputation level.

**Specific Color Bar**\- if you want to search for a specified colored confidant

**Promotion Microphone**\- by using charges of your microphone, you help endorse the earnings of your shop. You can refresh the time/stamina by consuming coffee from this area only, it's NOT consumable from your bag. By clicking the Gain Icon on the coffee, you can see where you can obtain more, except what's not featured here is the treasure hunt, you can get lots from there too. 

**Now let's talk Confidants*****, \*naughty bits ahead\****

When you click on a confidant, there are a few icons here:

**Fame Icon**\- (lipstick) When you reach a certain level of intimacy, you go up a rank of reputation and that in turn raises whatever stat or performance bonus that confidant has. Make sure you keep an eye of those, some are more valuable than others!

**Effect Icon**\- (crown)This is where you increase your shop earnings by your endorsements, you can manually upgrade them or use a soap bar to automatically boost these stats. The 2nd tab here is for the relations between your confidant and their talent counterparts. You can earn points by the microphone promotions, the salon exercise routines and film production. Upgrading these, help boost the ability points of those talents.

**Interact Icon**\- (heart with person) After you've reached a certain level intimacy through dating/gifts, you can see more of what they look like in the bedroom \*wink, wink\*

**Date Icon**\- (heart calendar) When you unlock a new confidant, you have a chance at 2 dates with them to learn their likes/dislikes, and a chance to hit a homerun, but after that, only 1 date is available per reset so choose carefully.

The heart featured in the middle is your current intimacy level for that confidant.

\---------------------------------------------------

**Car Icon**\- Takes you to the Vehicle Warehouse, clicking the (?) next to the title gives you an in-depth explanation. 

**Dismantle Icon**\- Unused or un-needed vehicles can be disassembled for spare parts that you can use to upgrade your other vehicles.

When you click on a talent that you've equipped a vehicle to, you can adjust the vehicle attributes like we did for confidants here. The bonus boost item here is a Wrench. 

You can adjust the viewing at the bottom right by all, or rarity of vehicles.

\---------------------------------------------------

**Shops, Businesses, and Money**

Each shop is a little different by what active event you complete or what other events are available for bonuses within the businesses.

**\*Diner**\- When you open this up, your buffs will be featured at the top left, the top right is currently the featured pack for cosmetic features. 

**Illustration Icon**\- (book) this is your album for cosmetics of your business, as you level up your business, you accumulate new cosmetics automatically band obtain paint points. You can use these paint points to get upgraded items but be careful because these points are shared between all of your businesses. In the book you can see the appearances you've already unlocked, ones you've yet to purchase, and the completed sets.

**Staff Icon**\- (person) This is where you can place your talents to serve as employees. (I'm not sure how much of a difference it is by adding specified talents to their specified colored shops, but since I'm ocd mine are set up that way.)

**Services Icon**\- (shop) This is where you use money to level up your shops.

**Bell Icon**\- (active service) a kitchen is set up and you have to manually serve your customers dishes. You start out with hot dogs and hamburgers, that slowly expand to more products. (In my screenshot I have hot dogs, hamburgers, french fries, pickles, lettuce, milkshakes, and coffee.) At store level 600, you unlock quick mode/auto and will no longer have to manually run the active events unless you choose to. Diner just gives money.

**\*Nightclub**\- You can choose a stage performer at random, first set is free, then it starts to charge diamonds, but you are given rewards at the end of each set.

The active service here is a match 3 game set up, yes you can and should strive for higher combinations because at the end they burst and add to the end total for earnings. Nightclub gives experience points.

**\*Garage**\- The active service here is either identifying the 3 things wrong with a vehicle, washing it, or fast tapping to dismantle it. Garage gives spare parts for vehicle upgrades.

**\*Salon**\- Features an exercise set where you can select confidants to participate in for extra rewards

 The active service here is to shave/cut hair around the specified area, there's a requirement photo in the top right corner or popping pimples for facials. Salon gives flowers for confidant intimacy upgrades.

**\*Photo Studio**\- Active service is just to match the correct scenes to whatever the customer is requesting, and it grants movie film and calculators for talent earnings.

**\*Ballroom**\- (It's not a strip club guys) The active for this doesn't seem to have a quick option, but boy you better be quick with your hand to eye coordination! This business features dances that you have to tap the bubbles to gain score, but as you unlock higher dances, they get faster and harder. Go away Kanye. Some of the dances will require you to slide into multiple bubbles. All dances have a time limit and as long as you are popping them as good, you can easily obtain 3 stars. You get rewards per dance and can get on the dance rank chart too that give rewards.

**\*Diviner**\- Not unlocked yet

Third tab is the **Factory**    [**https://photos.app.goo.gl/aS2ikT7vSCsiqKPRA**](https://photos.app.goo.gl/aS2ikT7vSCsiqKPRA) (*tabs 3-6)*

This will be your main experience area, and once you have no more tasks to your next rank, and you're out of travel fuel, you'll want to sit and grind out the factory to cap off the missing fame you need. Top of the page you have what stage you're on, and the progress to the next one. The experience gained here is also what's used to upgrade your talents. 

*Top left* is your: **Stage Map**\- Shows the name and level of the stage map you're at and what's to come.

*Top right*: **Stage Storage**\- Accumulated idle revenue experience for up to 12 hours.

*Bottom right*: **Clearance Reward Track**\- The track shows what each stage level has as a reward, sometimes you get vehicles

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

Fourth tab is **Talent**

Top of this page you can assort your talents by Quality, Abilities, or Aptitude. Bottom of the page is the All Bar where you can select talent by their colors.

Opening a talent profile, I used Barry (not Harry) as my example. At the top you can see the available experience I have to spend, the current vehicle I have equipped. You can see his current ability power, his level, current aptitude and what business I assigned him to. The icons here are:

**Enhance**\- (star) This raises his star level which ae upgradeable by pamphlets I have yet to find.

**Relations**\- (heart people) This shows which confidants he's associated with and their ability points. 

**Advance**\- Once you reach a cap of a level, you can upgrade your talent by using a specific number of items to reach the next level cap.

**Earnings**\- Can be leveled up by calculators and it's to raise your shop earnings.

**Aptitude**\- Has different levels that upgrade starting with *Medicore*, *Ordinary* and *Smart*. These are all upgraded by Caviar, but to obtain that item, you can either get them from shops or combine them in the merge tab of your bag from Spoonful of Caviars. Then there's the last one which is *Resolution* and that's raised by cereal of that talent's color. Since Barry's talent is orange, his cereal is Orange Citrus Cereal.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

Fifth tab is **Film**

Here you make movies (not pornos) that are featured to the theater, and you can co-op with friends for higher products. 

**Film Studio**\- At the top, you'll see the progression bar of the movie and how much is left to finish. At the bottom left will be the confidants you chose to lead in the film (this will grant confidant relationship effect tokens). Below that is the price your film is currently worth, and below that is the feature picture with its rarity.  for the hearts, I think it's the amount of intimacy distributed between the leads chosen for that film once completed, but don't quote me on that. To the right side you have the amount of available film (this refreshes throughout the day), and you can add more via a film roll. Then there's a camera below that with available upgrade options for High-Speed Filming and Film All that are purchasable via packages or through VIP. At the very bottom are all of the films you have currently active to film. Once you finish a film, you'll be given an option to choose a new script. You can choose between the free script, which is completely random, or a high-quality script. If you choose high-quality, once you choose a lead confidant, you can either spend gems (gem amount is increased depending on intimacy level) or use an item we haven't seen yet. >.>

**Cooperation**\- Upon opening you are greeted with a list of your finished films that are waiting to be paired with a co-op partner and is listed as pending. The Cooperated section is for your finished and already past paired films. At the top of the page, you see your current money spending limit, and the amount of all your current works combined. At the bottom right is a little **Cooperation Icon** (handshake) and that's when anyone is sending you a request to co-op with you. Under the pending section the button Propose takes you to 3 options, Local Server, Guild and Specify. The goal is to get as close to your finished amount as possible with a co-op so if it's low enough or if you're not in an active guild, choose local server. Not sure if the limit of 10 for guild is at a time or per day and then specify is say you have an astronomical high amount that no one can touch but maybe a friend not in your guild, you can request one with them. 

**Film Gallery**\- Here your highest earning film is displayed, or you can watch other films in your gallery.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sixth tab is for our **Bag**!

  
Here is where you get to collect (hoard) all your stuffs and things. Your bag will be set up with 3 pockets (an *Undetectable Extension Charm* say less) **Item**, **Event**, and **Merge**. 

**Item** slot features all your main materials for stamina refreshing to ability boosters and fragments for ssr's. 

**Event** slot currently only features furniture tokens.

**Merge** slot is where you combine smaller fragments into their greater counterparts. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------

While the goal is to be at the top, it isn't just about spending everything all at once. During the different events featured in the game, you'll want to save for the items that are only used in those events for a higher chance of a winning top title/rank. Some events will benefit you as well as your guild, so be sure to work together and help each other out!



I will try to keep track of the events and set up a calendar, if the game mods don't beat me to it. Please leave tips in the comments and I'll edit them in.",1,1737940021.0,u_beautiful_wonder,0,1.0,False

1iavtih,https://www.reddit.com/r/carmensandiego/comments/1iavtih/thoughts_on_carmens_capture_names_and_players/,"Thoughts on Carmen's Capture, Names, and Player's Ending.","I recently rewatched (binged) the series after last watching it when it's seasons first released. Still as good as before, even if I'm a bit older than the target audience. I've been an avid fan of geography for quite some time and Zack's hate of fish is so relatable. 

I found it reasonable enough that VILE ended up capturing Carmen as they could have had eyes on as many coffee shops as possible when Julia (a bit of a compromised contact, despite everything) wrote about something red with a code. They seem to have their own Crime Net (Law Net?) going, and a lucky break being that Carmen stayed long enough nearby and went alone. Even Chief bringing up her parents may have thrown her off long enough for the Cleaners to close in.

I was kinda miffed that they talked about Carmen's birth name but never revealed it. Same with teasing Player's first name when he was being pinged by Carmen. After thinking about it, I did feel less annoyed because if they are still crime fighting while technically being unlawful, it's imperative for their identities to not be revealed. Yes, it's a show, there is no real person to be compromising, but the choice made by producers did feel fitting for their characters.

As for Player's ending, even though the CC kept saying it was Player talking at the very end about Paper Star's capers, it honestly sounded more like Chief, especially since Devineaux reply was directed to Chief. Not just based on the reply, the voice actor behind the line sounded more like Chief. It could mean that Player may be the new Chief, but not only has it only been 2 years, it honestly doesn't feel like it's a likely scenario. Perhaps Chief Fraser may have retired after she finally found VILE (It was a rollercoaster that she was on tbh, I'd return to Commander after that haha), but for Player to step up to be Chief Bouchard? Hard to believe. From the scene where he's reassuring Carmen before she meets her mother at the cafe where he met Carmen for (probably) the first time, I think he may be pretty overwhelmed with socializing beyond a group considered safe to him; Carmen, Ivy, Zach, and Shadowsan. The fact that he wasn't really depicted to be really socializing with his classmates and his teacher's scolding, the scene where he seems a bit scared to go to in person school after signing off, even his initial apprehensiveness of both Gray and Shadowsan point towards this too. I felt a resounding connection to his contentment of being in the background. I found that being alone at the cafe with a seat for his friend while in call with her was his happy ending because it was once my own safe space while I was battling my crippling anxiety, even if it may be a bit unconventional. 

I still haven't really come to terms with the implication that Carmen would leave her family in Ivy and Zack. It feels cruel and out of character for Carmen. If anyone has any insights on their interpretation to help me swallow it, I'd love to hear it. Otherwise, I'd just forget about that scene, and have them on a Player encrypted personal line to Carmen.

I'm also a bit sad about Gray's choice to stay away, but his whole character is his ability to stick with his choices, however gray it may be.",4,1737939965.0,carmensandiego,0,1.0,False

I’m a 28-year-old from Europe, and I’m here looking for a connection that feels authentic—something built on shared understanding, good conversations, and maybe even a little magic. Whether we start with a friendly chat or dive into the bigger questions of life, I’m open to seeing where the journey takes us.

# A Bit About Me

* **Who I Am:** I’m a writer at heart—someone who’s fascinated by the world’s little details and always looking to capture its fleeting moments in words. I believe there’s poetry in everyday life if you look close enough. I’d describe myself as curious, introspective, and quietly optimistic.
* **My Interests:**
   * **Music:** I’m on a journey to become a vinyl collector (once I have the space for it!). I love crafting playlists that feel like soundtracks to moments in life, and I’m always hunting for new tracks that speak to the soul.
   * **Nature and Exploration:** Whether it’s hiking to catch a golden-hour view, wandering unfamiliar streets, or just stargazing on a clear night, I’m happiest when I’m exploring.
   * **Creativity:** I’ve been dabbling in photography lately, trying to turn fleeting scenes into lasting memories. Writing has always been my first love, but this new creative outlet is giving it some competition.
   * **Gaming and Relaxing:** On quieter days, I enjoy diving into a good game or settling in for a movie marathon—it’s all about balance, right?

# What I’m Looking For

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s as curious about life as I am. Here’s what I’d love in a partner:

* **Kindness:** You lead with your heart and care about the people around you. You’re the kind of person who finds joy in small gestures and values connection over pretense.
* **Curiosity:** You see the world as a big, wonderful puzzle to explore—whether that’s through travel, learning something new, or simply seeing the beauty in the everyday.
* **Openness:** Life is full of surprises, and you’re not afraid to embrace them. You’re willing to share your dreams, your quirks, and maybe even your favorite coffee order.
* **Partnership:** Someone who wants to build something together—a shared world full of laughter, quiet moments, and spontaneous adventures.

# Why Message Me?

I’d like to think I bring a unique mix of thoughtfulness and enthusiasm to the table. I’ll remember the little things about you—the way your favorite song makes you smile, the dreams you’re too shy to share, or the stories that light up your eyes. I’m loyal, steady, and the kind of person who shows up for the big moments and the small ones.

I believe in the magic of connection. Whether it’s through a shared playlist, a midnight chat, or a day spent exploring something new, I want to create moments that matter—moments that turn into memories we’ll always carry.

# Let’s Start a Story

If any of this resonates, send me a message. Let’s talk about music, share our favorite books, or dream up an imaginary trip to the most beautiful place we can think of. Or maybe we’ll just start with “hello” and see where the conversation takes us.

Every story starts with a single step—this could be ours. Looking forward to hearing from you. 😊",1,1737939937.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1iavt51,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iavt51,"Newbie setup, how I got here, and some gratitude","About 6 months ago, I decided our household needed an upgrade. My husband, the coffee drinker, was drinking daily keurig coffees. But I felt we could do better, morning coffee and tea was “our time” and I wanted to add more. This started so simply, tiny blade grinder, moka pot, and higher end coffees (Illy, Lavazza, etc). Enter the rabbit hole: a few videos on moka pot led me to realize our spice blade grinder was a ridiculous choice. So, scouring the internet for grinder suggestions I stumbled across Hoffman, Hedrick, and countless others. Coffee books, hours of videos, and more time than I can even try to fathom on Reddit, I have ended up here. Flair 58+2, DF54, NanoFoamer pro2, freshly roasted specialty coffees (local), and a plethora of accessories. (Now is a good time to mention I don’t drink coffee …but I’m learning). I’ve spent hours learning to dial in and switch up pressure profiles to obtain something that can take on our local cafe. All that to say, I appreciate the time, energy, and effort all the coffee people here put into these Reddit feeds which has carried me through an endless rabbit hole of spending lots of money, lots of time, but really learning something pretty great. Plus, I kinda just wanted to show off my beginner setup to a bunch of people who I believe just may appreciate something I’m super excited about. ",20,1737939932.0,espresso,5,0.92,False

The voyage through unknown waters was surprisingly uneventful. It was smooth sailing for the seven-ship convoy. Partially cloudy, blue sky, 75–80 degrees outside. The crews of each navy vessel have been given orders to study the information packets given to them by senior leadership. 

The book series has been made available to download and read for those who want to refresh their knowledge and for those who have never read them. Specific times have been reserved in recreation areas of the vessels for showings of the TV show “Game of Thrones”. Crew members have also been assigned to a type of “Book Club” team to discuss all they have learned. These “Book Clubs” are set for specific hours that do not interfere with their ship duties.

Those who know quite a bit about the book/TV series have been asked to spread the information they know to their fellow crewmates. The mess halls have become a meeting area for crew members to spread the information they know. In doing this, the crew morale has increased exceptionally. 

**Sunday night, 2359 Hours, November 2nd, 2025**

The convoy had been traveling non-stop since their departure from Norfolk. The ocean was quiet as the convoy began to slowly chug along to their destination for the night. There was a fog on the ocean, like a subtle film on the surface of coffee. 

The wind was cooling on the face. The bridge of the USS Abraham Lincoln was quiet as the crewmen and women performed their nightly tasks. The Operations Officer (Ops) and the Navigator (NAV) were looking over multiple computer-generated maps compared to satellite imaging. Looking for errors and course adjustments that may be needed, if any. 

“How's our heading?” The Ops Officer asks quietly, looking at the map the NAV is adjusting. 

Not changing his gaze from his work, “Looks good sir, we are just about to reach our ten-mile buffer zone in five minutes”

The Ops pat the Navigator on the shoulder, “Good work, I'll let the XO know”. He walks over to the XO, sitting in the captain's chair enjoying the sight of the open water, a cup of coffee in his hand.

“XO,” he says, making himself known. XO, turning his head to the Operations Officer, “How's our course Ops? Everything going to schedule?” sipping his coffee. 

“Yes, Sir, we are five minutes from the ten-mile buffer.” He moves to a computer next to the XO, pulling up the satellite map. “From the imaging, we should be just out of sight from the locals at the port, with the help of the fog. Sunrise is five minutes to 0700 hours.”

The XO finished sipping on his coffee, “Good work, I will let the captain know. You're the OOD. I will be quick” gets up from the chair and leaves the bridge, coffee still steaming in the cupholder. 

Making his way through steel-covered corridors, and stairways to the Captain's quarters. Greeting a few passing sailors on the way. The door of the Captain's quarters was simple, just “Captain’s Quarters” printed.

The XO knocks on the door, then again. And waits patiently for the Captain to make his way to greet him. Most likely half asleep. 

The sound of locks unlocking can be heard. The Captain opens the door, eyes partially opened so as not to be blinded by the light. 

“Captain, we are just about at the ten-mile buffer zone.”

The Captain grunts in acknowledgment, “How long until sunrise again? Six? Seven Hours?

“Yes sir, just about.”

“Good. Wake me up two hours before sunrise.”

“Yes sir.” The XO salutes and walks back to the bridge.

0530 Hours

The convoy still floats in the calm ocean, waiting patiently for orders. 

0540 Hours

They are given the order to move at a slow pace to match the sunrise. Getting to 4 miles from the port just before sunrise

0630 Hours

The Ambassador, Kelly O’Connor, is transported over to the USS Savannah from the USS Abraham Lincoln via helicopter. Dressed and ready to begin. Her “aide” decided to stay behind to perform his mission. 

She is escorted from the helipad to the bridge and meets with Captain Richard Webb, who will accompany her in first contact. 

0645 Hours “Time to show ourselves”

The convoy ships are ordered to begin their slow movement, except for the USS Savannah. Her orders are to go ahead of the convoy and begin the contact procedure. The sailors of the convoy contain their excitement for history in the making. 

The sun begins to slowly rise from the west, lighting up the land before it. Gleaming. 

**0715, “Contact”, Lannisport**

Ormar Hill was in his first year as a City Watchman, so far it was alright. Pay could be better, but he had a roof over his head. Hot food in his belly. And people respected him, to an extent the City Watch gets in a place like this. Better than most bastards like him. He was making his morning rounds on the harbor of Lannisport's biggest section. 

Rumor was a ship from The Arbor was coming in a day or two with their very best. Sweet Red Wine. He had been saving up for months since the rumors started to spread to bribe a sailor for a Flagon of Arbor Gold. A normal watchman like him would never be able to afford something so nice, but he was a very good gambler and an even better cheater. He had a total of 5 Gold Dragons, but since this wine might be going straight to the King riding down from The North on the “King’s Road”, it's going to cost an extra 200 silver to get his hands on a flagon.

Looking westward, The Sunset Sea was beautiful this time of morning. It seems to glow in the rising sun. Squinting his eyes a little, he sees a strange silhouette, almost like a ship. It’s about a league or two out, hard to tell. 

Another watchman was 50 yards to his right and called to him. “Hey! Looks like a ship is coming in. Massive by the looks. Let the Captain know!”

“Aye!” The watchman understands and makes his way back to the city to inform the Captain of the pier. With all the rumors going about, the market has been flooded with eager buyers. More guards have been called in every few days to calm the city in case of a run on the boat. 

Ormar watched as the man made his way into the city. As he watched, he heard the sound of clanking chain mail to his left. Another watchman named Geran Hill, another bastard, made his way from his post 50 yards to the left. He walks to his side, taking in the Sunset Sea, especially the oncoming ship. 

“So, what will you be buying today? Let me guess. Arbor Red?” The man asks, giving Ormar a little jab in the arm. 

“Of course. Only kind of wine that doesn't make your teeth feel like they're rotting from your mouth!” Ormar retorts, they look at one another and laugh at their amusement.

“Oy. Did you hear about that northerner that gone mad? Fisherman that moved from the south to the north.” Geran asked curiously. Still chuckling 

“No. It was probably the North itself that made him go mad. With them being tree worshipers and whatnot.”

“Aye. Or maybe his wife fucked a wolf. And had a bastard like Lord Eddard Stark” Geran joked. Making both City Watchmen laugh even harder.

Their laughter subsides and they both look towards the first ship in the morning. But, Ormar notices something strange about it. It’s moving fast, too fast for a normal sailing ship.

Pointing at the oncoming ship with the butt-end of his spear, “Does that ship seem odd to you?” Ormar says with concern in his voice.

Geran nods in agreement, “Aye, look at the colour as well. Like a grey-ish. I can't describe it.” He slowly walks inland. 

“Let's go to the watchtower, I believe they just installed a Myrish Eye a fortnight or so ago. A gift from some tyroshi I think.” Omar says following his pace. The two men go from a walk to a trot, then to a jog.

Upon arriving at the tower, two watchmen were already looking through the Myrish Eye. Speaking amongst each other in haste, of what Ormar and Geran couldn’t say of what. Usually, these two spoke so loud you could hear them from the outer gates. 

“What do you see up there?” Geran yells to the men, climbing up the ladder. The men don't respond, adding a deeper level of concern. 

Reaching the top and standing behind the two men. Each of them takes turns looking through this long bronze, ornate tube, which he can only promise to be this “Myrish Eye” Ormar was talking about. Both of them are whispering to each other. 

“What's going on here!” Geran yells with authority, even though he doesn't have any. The two men jump in surprise. *They didn’t even hear me climb up*, Geran thought.

“Well? What does the ship look like?” He questions further. Both men look at each other and then at him.

“Best you look at it, I wouldn't even know where to begin. It’s a ship, that's for sure, but I’ve never seen anything like it in all my years.” The old watchman to the left says, eyes older than him.

They step aside as he walks up to the Myrish Eye, slouching a little and looking through with his right eye. He sees something extraordinary. A vessel of such size and colour. It looks like something out of a child's dream. It has no sails, no ores of men rowing. He couldn't tell how the hell’s the thing was moving. Something he did recognize though was the anchor on the nose of the ship, and there was a number on the side just behind it. 28. Just 28.

Just before he asked the other two watchmen next to him, Ormar came up wanting a look. “Well? What is it?” Ormar asks

Not taking his eyes off the ship, “Mate, I don’t even know how to describe it. It’s a ship, that's for sure, but it's massive. Look” Geran gestures for him to see through the Myrish Eye. Ormar takes Gerans place at the Myrish Eye.

Taking a minute to absorb the scene in front of his eyes, Ormar composes himself. Stands straight up and turns to the two sentry watchmen, “You two! Find the Lord Commander! Now!” He orders the original men of this watch tower. They nearly fell off the watchtower.

**0725, USS Savannah**

An hour before, the USS Savannah sent a drone submarine out to scan the water depth of the harbor. The good news, it was deep enough for the ship. Strange news, the seafloor was riddled with shipwrecks. Something to ask the locals about later. 

Kelly, excited for first contact, decided to have a quick breakfast. Which was the equivalent of her college days. Piece of buttered toast and a Red Bull. She watched as the men and women of the USS Savannah moved around the bridge. Like bees. 

Looking out the window, she watched as the Savannah slowly came to the pier, 500 yards, 475 yards, 450 yards. Slowly creeping into the harbor. 

The captain, Captain Richard Webb, was giving out final orders. He turned to his XO “XO You have command. Keep an eye out for anything suspicious”

“Don’t worry. If it looks like trouble, we’ll fire off a warning shot to scare the locals. Or maybe just a blast of the fog horn.” she says with a smirk.

He matches that smirk, “Good to hear. Miss O'Conner and I will be on the flight deck. Radio when we're about to be docked.” they salute each other, Captain Richard turns to Kelly “Ready to go ma’am?”

“I guess so, but don’t you think this is a little much?” She says as they both leave the bridge. What she is referring to is the black body armor on her. It’s heavy and restrictive. 

Capt Webb chuckles, “Our job is to meet the locals, and at the same time protect you. So, better safe than sorry. We originally wanted you to wear a helmet but decided against it. You can take it off in the meantime before we go ashore. And if things on the ground look safe enough, you won't have to put it back on.” She quickly takes off the 25-pound armor plate without a second thought. 

He decided to take his off as well, fully showing his Service Dress Blue Uniform, he offered to take hers as well. She takes him up on the offer with a smile.

They make their way out to the flight deck, where four Marines are waiting for them. In green Combat Utility Uniform, wearing the same type of body armor. Pistol in a holster. A SIG Sauer P320-M18. With a specialized M27-IAR. With a radio and an assortment of equipment, she couldn’t name to save her life.

Oddly enough, none of the marines noticed them come outside. They were too busy looking port side up. Matching their gaze, she could understand why. A massive red mountain. No. A castle, built into a mountain. It could only be one thing. Casterly Rock. The satellite photos couldn't do it justice as to how big it was. Clouds pass by, truly showing the height.

The Captain's radio goes off, reporting for docking. She could feel the *Savannah* slow beside the pier under her feet. Deciding to get the ball rolling she walks over to the starboard side. Looking over at the city, it looks like something out of a history book. Stones buildings, high watch towers. It felt as if she was back in Dubrovnik, Croatia during her honeymoon.

She could see markets all along the main shore pier. It was busy, but everyone had stopped to watch the ship come into the harbor. There must have been six or seven dozen people, maybe more looking at them. Their faces in awe. 

Captain Webb joins her to take in the scenery, but he has to interrupt it. “Ma’am, looks like we have some company,” He said, pointing to the two men in red and gold armor walking down the stone pier, armor clanking with each step. 

Spears in hand. Ormar and Geran walk cautiously but confidently over to this massive grey ship. Above it was a sigil, neither of the men recognized it. They noticed two figures with another four behind them. On the left was a woman and on the right was a man. The back four, clearly guards of some sort.

They get about shouting distance from them, and they stare at each other. Not a word, not a whisper. Just the ocean breeze going by.

Kelly notes the armor the two men are wearing. The primary color scheme is red and gold. An ornate piece of a lion on the chest piece. Silver Helmet with a nose bridge for protection. Red cloak with a golden outline. Weapons are a long spear, a sword on one side of the hip, and a knife on the other.

She looked back at the five men with her. Marines armed with a pistol and rifle. And Captain Richard just had a pistol. “We might be over-protected,” She thought, knowing that even a 9mm could pierce that armor like paper.

“Hello down there. Do you speak English?” She yelled to the two strangers. Surprisingly, they seemed to understand her, which just made things a hell of a lot easier. No translator is needed. 

“Who is it, and where do you come from? Are you friend or foe!” the one on the right demands of her. “Off to an ok start, I guess,” she thinks.

“We come as friends. I am Ambassador Kelly O’Conner. And this is Captain Richard Webb of the USS Savannah. This ship.” She gestures to the vessel they stand on, “And we come from the United States of America. We are from the west of this place. What is this city called?” She finished telling the two men. She remembered she had to play ignorance in the meantime. Can’t give away her knowledge of the world they are in.

“This is the City of Lannisport, The Westerlands. Lord Tywin Lannister, Warden of the West, the Shield of Lannisport, Lord of Casterly Rock. Rules over the Westerlands. His cousin, Lord Tyran Lannister, governs this city.” the guard on the left says.

“May we meet Lord Tyran and Lord Tywin Lannister?” Kelly asks the guards, hoping talks could start today.

“My Lord Tyran Lannister is not here, he is meeting with Lord Tywin” the guard replies and points his spear at the massive mountain/castle. “He is there, Casterly Rock.”

“I see, well if it's alright with you could we come-” Before she could finish 5 more city guards came in a jogged over to the other 2, the one leading them was in more ornate armor. A lion-shaped helmet, with hair running down the back, and a deeper red cloak. The original two stands in attention for the presumably leader. They speak for a few moments, all the while the leader looks over to her and the captain.

The ornate one, clearly a high-ranking officer of some sort. Makes his way closer to the ship, keeping his surroundings in check to not fall into the water.

“My name is Ser Torran Lannister, Lord Commander of the city watch. You wish to speak with Ser Tyran, my father? And Lord Tywin?” The Lord Commander sounded in his 30s. Rough-sounding voice. 

“Why?” The man demands.

Kelly, taken aback a little at the rude command, “We wish to have diplomatic talks with the ruler of this land and open up trade and commerce.” The man still looking at them, she could feel the caution in the man's eyes. “May we come ashore? We come as friends.”

The commander was still skeptical. Orders his men to block off the pier leading to them. And orders one of the original two to run somewhere. To where she couldn't say.

“My Lady, you and your companions may come ashore. But I warn you if you mean violence.” He grabs the hilt of his sword, “We will not hesitate to defend ourselves”

Kelly looks to the captain and the Marines. Then back at the Lord Commander, “We understand, we will be down in 5 minutes.” 

They walk away from the side of the ship, “Well, so far so good. What now?” Kelly asks the Captain

Captain Webb thinks for a moment, “Now? We go ashore and explain ourselves. Without giving away a crap-ton of our knowledge”

“Good enough for me” Agreeing with him. The Captain calls for the Marines to follow them inside. Through the door, and down some stairs that lead to the mission cargo bay. A squad of marines is examining equipment and final checks in case things go sideways.

  The Captain walks over and greets the Squad Leader, the four marines from earlier following. A young man, probably early 20s, freshly shaven, hair kept neat. Both men talk for a time. Once finished, the Squad Leader gives a salute. The Captain returns it. 

The Captain returns to Kelly as the squad of marines is given their orders and finish up what they were doing. “So. What did you tell them?” she questions the Captain

Looking at her, “I simply told them the truth. If things seem to get dicey, I'll radio for the whole squad to come out of the ship.”

Before she could reply, a woman crew member greeted them both with a salute.  “Captain. The ramp is ready to go when you are.” 

“Shall we?” Captain Webb gestures over to the cargo ramp.

On the pier, a small crowd of City Watchmen joins Lord Commander Torran Lannister to meet these “Strangers”. All of them have been ordered to stand in a straight line from side to side. Just as a precaution. The man who spotted these “Strangers” came back as well. 

But the curiosity is too strong, it takes control of their discipline. Looking in awe and wonder at the strange “ship”. Studying its lack of sails and oars, “How does it move”, and “What keeps it afloat, it is clearly made of metal.”, “It seems to be steel. It shouldn’t be afloat.” So many questions, the waiting to ask them is agonizing. 

*Buzz, Whirr, Ca-Clunk, Vroom. Hissing*

Abruptly, the ship starts to make a loud and strange noise that startles the watchmen. On the Starboard Quarter side, a massive door or ramp comes down onto the stone pier. The noises were nothing any of the men had heard before, like a sheep or a goat being slaughtered. Or the sound of metal being beaten on. Such loud noises. 

With a loud ***THUD***, the ramp settles down on the pier. And the strangers walk out. Lord Commander Torran Lannister, and the other City Watchman that first spotted the strange vessel. He couldn’t remember or care to remember his name. All he knew was that he was a bastard. Watched as the strangers walked down their ramp. 

Taking her first step on the stone pier. Kelly felt like an astronaut. A new era of history beginning. 

The Captain and the four Marines followed suit, standing tall with pride. The sun gleamed on the metal of the rifles. 

The ambassador’s group and the two watchmen were 25 yards away from each other. Just staring at one another, waiting for one of them to make the first move. The water waves move up and down the pier stone. The air was still, not a sound, not a whisper. 



Lord Commander Torran, breaks the ice, turning to order five watchmen to block the way. “Mmm”. He grunts to the Watchmen next to him to follow. The metal of their armor subtle clinks and clangs with each step. 

On cue, Kelly and Captain Webb match them, two Marines stay behind, and the other two follows without missing a beat. Strides matching. Left foot. Right foot. Left foot. Right foot.

All eyes at the market were on the two groups moving to meet. The market is silent, except for the sound of animals. Waiting for something bad to happen. 

5 yards. 5 yards was the most comfortable length Kelly wanted. The Lord Commander seemed to agree, stopping in his step. Both groups now still, examine one another, taking in every detail they can see. A small gust of wind came past, flowing the Lord Commander’s deep red cloak.  

Lord Commander Torran, examines each of the strangers. The first two up front are the important ones. The left one, a woman, surprisingly. Wore a strange blue Tunic that was cut halfway down, with a white shirt that seemed to have buttons. With some black trousers with black shoes that seemed to shine in the sun. The man on the right is clearly military. It was in what seemed to be all black, with certain areas in gold. He had a strange thing on his head, not a helmet but a cap, maybe. One thing they both have in common is a pin, on their left breast, small with what seem to be stripes of red and white.

“Their armor is, interesting, to say the least.” Kelly thinks to herself, as she studies the two men in front of her. The Lord Commander’s armor made him shine. His gold breastplate had an ornate metalwork of rings going down the middle. It seemed to give him ample mobility, with the mix of leather and chain mail pants. Red arm and bits of leg armor. His helmet was shaped like a lion, with brown hair flowing from the top. 

 

The other guard's armor was just, basic. Gold head to toe, the parts that moved a lot were flaking. His helmet was a silvery-grey. Freshly cleaned to not tarnish. The man's cloak was clean, except for the bottom bits. It looked like he walked through some, hopefully, “Mud”. His shoes also had bits of this “Mud” on it as well. Looking at the guard closer, it wasn't a man. But a young man, probably 19-20. 



Deciding to start introductions over again, “Allow me to reintroduce myself. My name is Kelly O’Conner, Ambassador for the United States of America. This is Captain Richard Webb of the USS Savanah.” Kelly gestures to the vessel once more “And these are our guards, US Marines” Gesturing to the 2 men behind her, motionless, no expression on their faces.

“My name is Torren Lannister, Son of Lord Tyran Lannister, Lord Commander of the City Watch of Lannisport.” The Lord Commander says in kind.

“It is a pleasure to meet you, Lord Commander,” she says, walking over to the man with her hand out to shake.

Skeptical, he walks to shake her hand. It’s soft, like someone who has never worked in a field. He decides to ask the obvious question, “So where is this, United States of America?”

“We are located West of here. About 6 to 700 miles to be exact. Took us about two days to get here.”

“700 miles? In two days? That is impossible. Even if the winds are on your side, as well as the weather. That would take you nine days, a week, at minimum.” The Lord says, in shock, taking his hand away from the “Ambassador”. 

“What magic is this?” Looking at the ship these “Strangers” had.

“It is not magic, Lord Commander, but use something called an “Engine” to power our vessels. That is how we got here so fast.”  Captain Webb exclaimed. He could hear the pride in every word the man spoke. 

Still looking at the ship, “Siege Engines move this ship? How is that possible?”

“Not that kind of engine Lord Commander. It’s hard to explain. The engines burn fuel that moves turbines.” The Captain tried to explain

The Lord Commander decided to move past that. “We never knew that a kingdom was out in The Sunset Sea, every few years some sailer would go out far that way and never return.”

“Not surprised. To tell you the truth, we weren’t out there as a few weeks ago. That was until The Storm happened, then all of a sudden we just popped up here.” The Captain decided to go with the truthful answer. 

Now the Lord Commander was visibly confused, as well as the guard next to him. They looked at each other in this confusion, then back to the “stranger”,  “My lord, I don’t quite understand. How does a kingdom just how you say “Popped” out of nowhere?”

Giving a little chuckle, “We are not a kingdom Lord Commander. That doesn't matter now. What we’re saying is that we are not from this world. And to answer the “How”. We simply don’t know right now.” The Captain replied.

“I presume this land is a Kingdom. What is its name and who is the king?” Kelly said, wanting to move past what the Captain just said.

“Yes, we are a Kingdom, my Lady. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. King Robert of the house Baratheon, first of his name. King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm.” The Lord Commander said, with all the bride of Lannister blood flowing through his veins.

“That is quite a title. We would be honored to meet him soon.” Kelly said, hopefully charming the man with pride to move things along. She felt a bit uncomfortable close to him. She could smell alcohol in his breath. 

The Lord Commander absorbed all the information that the two “Strangers” in front of him had given him. “It would probably be best for you to explain your situation to my father Lord Tyran Lannister, and the Warden of the West, Lord Tywin Lannister, I sent a man to the Keep of the City watch to send a raven to Casterly Rock to inform them of the situation. The man has strict orders to not send it until my command.”

“In the meantime, I can take you to the “Golden Keep” until we get a reply.” He says, pointing to a massive stronghold towards the end of the city, it looks hundreds, if not thousands of years old. Able to stand against the strongest storms.

Kelly, not wanting to be rude, “With all due respect Lord Commander, we have orders not to leave the sight of the ship for our safety. We would like to meet them here on the pier if that is alright. As a form of “Neutral Ground”. If that makes sense.”

The Lord Commander looks up and along the ship, “I don’t see any archers, but if you have orders then I understand. It will take some time before we get a reply from The Rock. I will tell them of your conditions”

“Thank You, Lord Commander” Kelly gives a little bow, and Captain Richard just nods his head. 

“My Lady,” The Lord Commander says to her, looking at the Captain, “Captain Richard Webb”. He and the guard give them both a bow and make their leave.

Watching both men walk away, except for the ones blocking the way to leave. Captain looks to Kelly.

“So. What now?”

“Now?” Kelly questions. “Now. We wait.”",0,1737939891.0,HFY,3,0.5,False

1iavn9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1iavn9s/top_3_new_mini_habits_making_the_greatest_impact/,Top 3 new mini habits making the greatest impact to my health in 2025 so far,"This is the year I'm obsessed with data tracking, analysis, and tweaking lots of small actions to make a big difference with my wellbeing. This far, my top 3 new habits have been:

1. Eating my last meal at least 3 hours before bed. I just make sure to finish eating around 7pm, and heading to bed around 10pm. I'm no longer feeling uncomfortable disgusting food while laying down. I feel like I'm burning more/extra energy before bed, sleeping way better, and waking up feeling lighter. I was previously not a ""breakfast person"", so I'd skip food until early in the afternoon. Now I'm having a light breakfast after my coffee, which is giving me a burst of energy and more mental clarity in the morning. It's also a bonus opportunity to get in fruit, yogurt or a protein shake, so my diet is way more balanced.


2. No screen time at least 30 minutes before bed. I'm falling asleep so much easier! It feels amazing to NOT stare at a screen before sleeping. Scrolling allows time to get away from me, so sometimes a ""quick 10 minute scroll"" before sleep would turn into an hour, meaning I'm getting less sleep or waking up later the next day. I'm getting further into reading my current book, which satisfies a feeling of accomplishment. It's tempting at the end of the day to finish up what I'm doing so I can crawl into bed, relax and fall into another world.


3. Adding a cold shock of water at the end of my showers. I now LOOK FORWARD TO a blast of cold water, my gosh. The adrenaline/dopamine rush has become addictive. It's such a tiny, extra habit, but feels like such a brave thing to do. Once I pushed my mind past the fear of being cold, it helped me realise things aren't so scary or difficult as we may think.

So, there you have it. One big takeaway is that, if you want to have a good day tomorrow, it starts with today! Everything you do has a flow-on effect, so the more good choices you make, the greater the impact.

There is a lot more science behind the benefits of these habits, but I wanted to write on the impacts they've had for me, personally. Hopefully, they inspire you to try some new things, too!",7,1737939456.0,DecidingToBeBetter,0,1.0,False

Anyway, some very heated words were exchanged, and it ended up me throwing the wedding ring I gave him with my name engraved on it in the trash. He then out of nowhere shoved me hard straight into the washing machine. I was holding a coffee cup, and I slammed against the washing machine, and coffee got everywhere. He told me to ""clean it up you fucking slob"" and called me ""a fucking piece of shit"".

He has left for the day and at this point I don't know what to do.  I don't have any evidence of all this. I was thinking of filing a police report in case something like this happens again and I need to get custody of my kids,  but I am nervous he will file one against me because I have said some pretty mean things over text. 

I am honestly feeling a little scared to be around him, and nervous when he gets home. This is California by the way ",58,1737938658.0,legaladvice,33,0.76,False
