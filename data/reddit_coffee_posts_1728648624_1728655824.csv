# Eye-Catching Visuals and Images

Take a moment to imagine a world without your Amazon [**listing images**](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions-on-optimizing-your-amazon-listing-images/). That’s how important they are. Your customers won’t really know what to expect from your goods, no matter how much you praise it. 

They would be cautious about buying for this reason. For that reason, product pictures are very helpful: it’s very hard to get people to buy something they can’t see for themselves.

Customers can be sure they’ll get what they pay for when you have clear, high-quality pictures of your products. That’s not all—your images are also a big part of getting more clicks, fewer returns, and fewer bad reviews.

# Amazon Main Image Requirements

Your main image, also called a “hero image,” is the first picture that shows up on the product detail page and the one that people look for. Additionally, it might show up in Google’s search results. Doing this right could give your bottom line a huge [boost.Amazon](http://boost.Amazon) customers can choose from a lot of goods, so you want your [main image](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-amazon-products-main-image/) to stand out by being professional and making it very clear what you’re selling. If there is any doubt about this or if the picture quality is bad, people will just keep scrolling and visit other pages.Because the main image is so important to the shopping experience, Amazon also has rules about how to take pictures of main [**listing images**](https://www.amzonestep.com/services/amazon-product-photography).

# Tips for Amazon Product Images

# Cover All Available Space

Use all the space [**Amazon FBA**](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-resolve-a-content-upload-issues-on-amazon-fba/) gives you for pictures. Add a full set of seven pictures, and make sure they’re all different. 

   * Put your products on display from different angles.
   * Use models to assist the buyer in envisioning themselves utilizing or donning the item.
   * Display your item in a suitable indoor or outdoor setting. For example, if you’re selling a spatula, show it turning pancakes over a fire.
   * Add visual interest by changing the backgrounds of your extra pictures. 
   * Include infographics and layered measurements if appropriate.

# Create Unique Lifestyle Images

Allow potential buyers to experience your product firsthand and understand why it fits with their interests. You should think about your ideal customer or target group. Include pictures of that kind of person.

Shooting yourself, your friends, or your family using the product is a simple way to get social photos. Even if you don’t have a professional camera, you can still take motion or lifestyle photos that convey information. 

For instance, if you’re offering a paddleboard, go out on the water and take pictures of it in use with your phone!  

# Add Text to Your Images

By adding details about the product to the photos, you can make it shine out. Your business will have a particular image and feel on Amazon if you use the same fonts and colors.



* Explain what your product does and why it’s important. 
* Include measurements, sizes, or other important details 
* Write down the things that were used to make your goods. 
* The ingredients should be shown on a food or vitamin product. 
* Make charts that show why someone should buy your product instead of a competing one.

# Improve Your Amazon SEO

When you sell things on Amazon, one of the most important things to think about is how your goods will rank in search engines**.** [**Amazon FBA**](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-grow-your-amazon-fba-brand-with-the-selling-partner-appstore/) has made its algorithm that decides which products to show based on the user’s search purpose and quality to handle this in the best way possible.

This system is known as the “[A9 Algorithm](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-feed-amazon-a9-algorithm-during-product-launch/).” It is a set of rules and instructions that have been created to help customers get the best results when they use the Amazon search engine to do internal searches.

# The Conversion Rate

* Amazon sorts its search results by the number of sales to show the items that have sold the most. So, if you have a bad product or a badly optimized product listing that doesn’t focus on the needs your product meets, the product’s place will fall over time.
* If you have a good product and a good [amazon listing](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-small-amazon-listing-tweaks-can-lead-to-big-sales/), you still need a good plan to get good scores so that your product can reach its full potential. Good reviews are very important and help a lot with placing your product, but you shouldn’t start building your house from the roof down.
* There is a public part of questions for each product. People can write down their questions to find out more about a product before they buy it. These kinds of questions are very important to Amazon because they show that people are really interested in the goods and act as proactive customer service on their site.
* Amazon FBA wants its customers to be able to find the best deals on goods, but we don’t see how that helps shoppers. For instance, for the same keyword or search purpose, two different sellers may offer either a poorly made or a well-made product. By looking at the Amazon search results, you can’t find a trend that says cheaper items are ALWAYS higher up.

# Relevance

This is where you can directly affect all of the factors listed by using the steps on your product page.We will talk about them later, but first we will talk about how important it is to do good keyword research for Amazon. By doing this, you’ll be able to show your goods based on what people really want and need.A big mistake is trying to rank for keywords that get a lot of searches with the idea that more people searching means more people will see your goods and buy from you.When people search for your product using keywords that don’t really relate to the needs it should meet, you might get more hits, but you won’t get a higher percentage of sales from each visit. It’s important to optimize the following things after doing keyword research:

# Titles

When it comes to titles, the maximum number of characters that can be used is 80, including spaces. When choosing what to put in the title, do your research on the best keywords. You can sometimes post longer titles through the system; however, this will only help the user read more at first glance. Any more terms won’t change where it ranks.

# Features And Bullet Points

Just to the right of your product pictures are these five points. These are read by REAL people. If you want to sell your goods, don’t lie or make false claims. This is where you should talk about how your product solves the problem and what your business stands for.

# Product Description 

To achieve an [SEO goldmine](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/seo-goldmine-amazon-sellers-are-missing-out-on/), the keyword-heavy product description is losing value, but the engaging product description (or Enriched Content if you have an Amazon FBA brand) is very important for sales. It will get people to read it, which will lead to sales, customer trust, a lower “bounce rate,” and more time spent on the page overall.

# Monitor Keyword Performance

Monitoring your keyword success is another way to improve CTR on Amazon FBA besides using negative keywords. Although some keywords might look like they would work well with your ads, they might not get you the results you want.

Some of your keywords may be too broad if they get a lot of views but not many clicks. Those keywords should not be targeted anymore or should be removed completely so that you can focus on keywords that get clicks.

Although you may only be focusing on a few very specific keywords, your Amazon CTR will go up because you’ll be finding the most useful and productive terms.

# Backend Keywords

When it comes to optimizing your Amazon listings for seasonal keywords, the backend hidden search terms are often skipped over. 

One way to make sure you get indexed for seasonally relevant keywords all year long is to use fat-head keywords like “him,” “her,” “daughter,” “son,” “men,” and “women” to take advantage of search terms like “Christmas gifts for her,” “Christmas gifts for men,” etc.

For a second, let’s make an assumption. You might sell backpacks, sleeping bags, waterproof phone cases, or even toiletries that are small enough to take with you. 

You’ll want to make sure that your listings are optimized for all summer vacation-related keywords by the time summer comes around. Now, let’s look at the term “camping accessories.” If you look for the term on Google Trends, you can see that it was most popular in the early summer and again in November of last year.

# How to Use Seasonal Keywords

* It’s not as easy as adding ‘Christmas gifts for mum, dad or grandma’ to the end of your title to use holiday keywords in your customer-facing copy. Like any well-written text, you need to make sure that the keywords you choose fit with and are related to your goods. 
* Perhaps you should omit “stocking stuffer” from the title of your item if you’re offering industrial hardware!
* If you use fat-head terms, more people may visit your product and buy a variety of things, but they might not be looking for your specific product. No matter how appealing the number of searches for a term might be, you should be picky about the ones you use.
* If you want to use a bullet to sell your product as a holiday gift, don’t use too many keywords; instead, talk about your product’s unique selling points and how it will improve your life. Relevance and clarity are still the most important things, no matter the season.

# Customer Feedback

# Use Positive Reviews to Your Advantage

When someone raves about your product, it’s time to break out the confetti! Positive reviews are the social proof you need to entice shoppers to click. Think of it as free marketing from people who already bought your product.

# Example

Let’s say you sell a coffee mug that keeps beverages hot for 12 hours. One customer leaves a review saying, “I filled this mug with coffee at 8 AM, and it was still hot at 8 PM! Forget microwave reheats—this thing is magic!”

Now, don’t let that review just sit there in the reviews section, gathering virtual dust! Take a snippet from this review and add it to your product description or bullet points. Something like: “Keep your coffee hot for up to 12 hours—no more reheats needed!”

# Address Negative Feedback Like A Pro

Bad reviews are like stepping in gum—super annoying, but with the right mindset, you can use it to your advantage. First things first: when you receive negative feedback, don’t panic. Instead, see it as an opportunity to improve your product page and attract more clicks.

# Example

You sell a pair of workout leggings. A customer leaves a 2-star review: “The leggings are great, but the waistband keeps rolling down during my workout. Not ideal!”

Instead of ignoring that or responding defensively, you could update your product description to manage expectations: “Designed for light workouts or daily wear. For high-intensity exercises, check out our high-waist version!”

Not only do you show potential buyers that you’re honest and responsive, but you also make sure they know exactly what they’re getting. This clarity can make buyers more likely to click because they trust you.

# Respond to Reviews—Good and Bad

Interacting with reviews is like talking to your guests at a party—it shows you care. Responding to reviews, whether positive or negative, shows that you’re engaged, helpful, and responsive.

# Example

If a customer says, “Loved the quality of the shoes, but the sizing runs a little small,” respond with something like: “Thanks for your feedback! We recommend going up half a size for the perfect fit. We’re always working on improving!”

Not only does this show potential buyers that you’re paying attention, but it also gives you a chance to fix any misunderstandings that could cost you a sale.

# Conduct A/B Testing on Your Ad

Running A/B tests on your ad is one way to get more people to click on it on Amazon. Your ad might not be getting as many clicks because the product title or picture doesn’t make people want to click.

A/B testing can help you figure out if you need a more detailed product title or if you need to include certain details, like the color or size, to get more people to click on it. 

You can also use this testing to find out if you need a new picture of your product that shows it better. By trying your [product ads](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/why-amazon-video-product-ads-convert-better-the-power-of-visual-storytelling/), you can find out how to make small changes that will increase your CTR on Amazon.

# Free Shipping 

Here’s a fun fact: People hate paying for shipping. Even if it’s just a few bucks, it can feel like an insult. Shoppers would rather pay $100 for a product with “free shipping” than $90 with an additional $10 shipping cost. It’s irrational, but it’s human nature!

Let’s take a look at how free shipping plays out on Amazon.

# Example

Imagine you’re looking for a new pair of headphones. Two listings catch your eye:

* Headphone A: $50 with $5 shipping
* Headphone B: $55 with free shipping

Which one are you more likely to click on? Most people will choose Headphone B because free shipping feels like they’re getting a better deal—even if the total price is the same.

# How to Offer Free Shipping Without Breaking the Bank

“Okay,” you’re thinking, “Free shipping sounds great, but I’m not Amazon Prime! How can I afford to do this?” Great question! Here are some strategies that won’t drain your profits.

# Raise Your Product Price Slightly

One easy way to cover shipping costs is by bumping up your product price just a little. Most customers won’t notice if you add a dollar or two to the price, especially if free shipping is on the table.

# Example

If your product costs $15 and shipping is $3, try selling it for $17.99 with free shipping. People love the “free shipping” more than they care about the extra couple of bucks.

# Offer Free Shipping on Orders Over a Certain Amount

You don’t have to offer free shipping on every single item. Many sellers find success offering free shipping for orders over a certain threshold, like $25 or $50. This also encourages customers to buy more so they can unlock the magical [free shipping](https://medium.com/great-business-stories/insight-the-birth-of-amazons-free-super-saver-shipping-83569d331549)!

# Example

Think of it like this: You’re at a fast-food place, and they say, “Buy 10 nuggets, and we’ll throw in fries for free!” Suddenly, you’re ordering more than you planned. The same logic applies to free shipping—customers will often add more items to their cart just to avoid that shipping fee.

# Incorporate Shipping Costs into Bundles

Another sneaky way to offer free shipping is by creating product bundles. Customers feel like they’re getting a great deal, and you cover your shipping cost by selling more items at once.

# Example

If you sell skincare products, try bundling a moisturizer and face wash together for $25 with free shipping. The customer gets more value, and you can easily absorb the shipping cost since you’re selling two items instead of one.

# Amazon Bundling Strategy

Customers want you to sell more items, and Amazon bundling can help you do that. Bundled items are usually not as affected by hyper-competition as individual goods can be. 

The seller owns the whole Buy Box when they launch a new set. How do you make an awesome Amazon bundle? How can you pack items together on Amazon FBA to make more sales?  In short, Amazon states that a bundle should have these features:

* Makes shopping on Amazon easier and more affordable
* Contains things that go well together, like peanut butter and jelly.
* Branded goods are included (generic goods are not included).
* Brand new and not the same thing that’s already on Amazon

It’s also necessary for packages to include more than one single item, each of which must have its own ASIN or UPC and be sold as a single unit.

Last but not least, it goes without saying that your packages should make you money. It’s not always as easy as it looks to keep track of bundle success. 

You may still be selling parts separately even if you’re also selling the deal as a whole. Keeping track of your books is hard when your product comes and goes. Maybe you need to get help from the pros.

# Run Amazon Sponsored Ads

As an Amazon FBA seller, you’ve probably wondered: When is the best time to run Amazon Sponsored Ads? This question might seem trivial, but it can be the difference between a weak click-through rate (CTR) and a cash machine. 

Whether you’re selling organic dog treats or luxury candles that smell like freshly baked cookies, timing your ads just right can make a huge impact on your CTR.

So, grab your coffee (or tea if that’s your vibe), and let’s dive into the perfect timing for your Amazon Sponsored Ads—because you deserve those clicks!

# Prime Time vs. Dead Time

Amazon’s “Prime Time” for sponsored ads isn’t during some mysterious event in July (though [Prime Day](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-prepare-amazon-prime-day-coupons-and-exclusive-deals/) is huge!). No, we’re talking about the hours of the day when the most eyes are on their screens.

These prime times are typically early in the morning, during lunch breaks, and later in the evening after people have clocked out of work.

But beware of dead time—the dreaded hours when potential customers are too busy living their lives to click on ads. Running ads at 3 AM might seem tempting because of less competition, but your CTR might take a nosedive if no one is awake to see it.

# Example

Let’s pretend you’re selling office supplies—planners, notebooks, pens with motivational quotes, etc. Your target audience likely works a 9-5, meaning they’ll be most active during lunch breaks (12 PM-1 PM) or in the evening between 7 PM and 10 PM when they’re scrolling through Amazon for productivity hacks before bed.

# Weekends are Gold Mines

Weekends are like the Black Friday of weekly shopping. People have time to browse, and they’re in the mood to shop (and maybe impulse buy… we’ve all been there). If you’re selling leisure products—think board games, camping gear, or anything people use for weekend fun—this is when you’ll get the most clicks.

But don’t forget weekdays, especially for work-related products. Many shoppers browse Amazon during their lunch breaks, and studies show that Tuesday through Thursday sees higher engagement rates.

# Example

If you’re selling yoga mats or workout gear, your best bet is running ads on Saturday mornings when people are planning their week’s workout schedule. They’re motivated, energized, and looking to invest in their fitness routines (and maybe impress their gym buddies with new gear).

# Prime Day and Major Sales Events

If there’s one universal rule to running Amazon ads, it’s this: Prime Day and Black Friday are prime times for boosting your CTR. During these events, people are in buying mode, and they’re actively searching for deals. 

These days are not the time to hold back. Increase your budget, run your ads all day, and prepare for an influx of clicks.

# Example

On [Prime Day](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2024/08/21/october-prime-day-2024/), your best strategy is to run ads in bursts throughout the day. Start strong early in the morning, then ramp up again in the afternoon when people get off work and continue into the late evening. You’ll likely see spikes in your CTR as shoppers hunt for deals.

# Why Is Amazon CTR Important?

It’s important to keep track of the number of clicks on your Amazon ads, but why? You need to keep an eye on your Amazon CTR to see how well your ads are doing and see if people are clicking on them. 

See if your ads are useful to people who are searching for them or if you need to make changes to your ad campaigns to make them work better. Individuals see your ad, think it’s important, and click on it if your Amazon CTR is high. You can tell that your price is fair, your product is reliable, and other things if your CTR is high.Customers aren’t interested in your ads if your Amazon CTR is low. This means that your ad efforts aren’t working well. For example, it could mean that your ad is important to people who are searching or that you need to adjust your product listing.Figure out which ads work well and which ones need changes to boost your Amazon CTR by knowing your click-through rate.

# How to Use Video Content to Drive Clicks on Amazon

# Why Video Content is the Superhero of CTR

We live in a world where attention spans are shorter than a TikTok dance. If your product listing doesn’t grab someone by the eyeballs in the first few seconds, they’re gone. This is where videos come in like a superhero swooping in to save the day. Here’s why:

# Videos Are Visually Engaging

People love shiny things. A well-made video offers visual stimulation that simple text or static images just can’t match. When a customer scrolls through Amazon and sees a [product video](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-maximize-your-amazon-product-video-on-amazon-fba/), their brain lights up. It’s like waving a giant neon sign that says, “HEY, LOOK AT ME!”—and trust me, they will.

# Videos Build Trust Faster Than a Trust Fall

There’s something about seeing a product in action that builds instant credibility. When a customer watches a video, they get a clearer understanding of what they’re buying. No smoke, no mirrors, just pure, unfiltered product awesomeness. And when people trust your product, they’re more likely to click on it.

# Videos Can Explain What Words Can’t

Let’s face it: sometimes your product is too cool to explain in words. Imagine trying to describe how a self-cleaning litter box works to a customer. You could write “it cleans itself” a hundred times, but a video showing a sleek robotic arm sweeping away kitty mess? That’s pure magic.

# Types of Videos That Make Shoppers Click Faster Than “Add to Cart”

Now that we know why videos are a CTR-boosting powerhouse, let’s talk about what kinds of videos work best on Amazon. Spoiler: it’s not just about having any video. Your product needs the right kind of video.

Think of it like casting the perfect actor for a blockbuster role (and no, your product is not the next James Bond, but it is the Tom Hanks of kitchen gadgets).

# The “How It Works” 

Ever bought something and then had no idea how to use it? Frustrating, right? A how-to video solves that problem, giving shoppers a crystal-clear idea of how your product works before they even click “Buy Now.” 

* For example, if you’re selling a pressure cooker, show how it perfectly steams veggies, cooks soups, and turns a Sunday roast into a Michelin-star dish. Let them know that with your product, they’ll be whipping up dinner faster than you can say “Instant Pot.”
* If you’re selling a set of “magical” hair curlers, a video showing how quickly someone can transform from frizzy to fabulous will get you clicks like nobody’s business. People don’t want to guess how it works—they want to see it work.

#  The “Product in Action” 

Show, don’t tell. People want to see your product doing its thing in the real world. Whether it’s a coffee maker brewing the perfect cup of joe or a vacuum cleaner that’s strong enough to inhale pet hair like it’s on a dust-bunny buffet, let the video speak for itself.

* Imagine selling a blender. Instead of saying, “Blends smoothly,” show a video of it crushing ice, blending fruits, and making smoothies so thick, even a straw would need a workout. It’s about getting potential buyers to say, “Whoa, I need that.”

# The “Unboxing” Experience

Everyone loves an unboxing video. The anticipation, the sound of the package opening, the moment of “Ohhh, shiny!”—it’s a journey. Use an unboxing video to give customers a first-hand look at what they’re going to get and how it feels to open your product.

* Selling luxury headphones? Show a sleek unboxing where your packaging looks so good, it could double as a gift. Highlight all the little details, from the texture of the case to the first glimpse of the product itself.

She rolled over from her right side to her left side to find last night’s regret still asleep.  She put her hand on his shoulder and gently shook him.  “Hey, wake up...wake up.”

Nate groggily muttered something unintelligible.

“Wake up.  You need to get out of here.”

He got out from under the covers and stumbled out of bed onto the floor.  After he hastily got dressed, he leaned over to her bed and gave her a kiss.  “Let’s do this again soon.”

“Yeah sure, some other time,” she waved him off, desperately trying to go back to sleep.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

Sipping his coffee, Mark castigated himself after last night’s brief text exchange with Steffi.  He looked at his messages one more time just to make sure he didn’t miss a message from her.

Mark: *“I did.  How did you know?”*

He reread his last message to her, which he sent last night.  It took him an agonizing five minutes to type that short message.  She still hadn’t replied.  Eventually he couldn’t take the silence.

Mark: *“Are you mad at me?”*

Steffi: *“Sorry!  I fell asleep last night.”*

Steffi: *“I’m a little hungover.  Do you want to grab a bite with me?”*

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

Mark and Steffi sat at a table in a Vietnamese restaurant, with bowls of steaming pho before them.

“You know, I was only messing around with you last night,” she said, clearly amused.  “I didn’t think you actually bought her that expensive bag.”

He looked down at his soup, too embarrassed to address the facts.

“You regret it?  Is this how you used to feel with me?”

He was not prepared for such a direct and unfiltered question.  “Maybe sometimes, but it was different with you…” he trailed off, not knowing how to finish that thought.  He started to expose himself, even if just a little bit.

Before going too deep with their feelings, she steered the conversation toward more familiar territory.  “What this means is that you should have bought that bag for me.”  She averted her eyes from him and squeezed a lime over her bowl.

“No, I don’t think that’s what it means,” he dismissed her statement while slurping down a mouthful of noodles.

“Well, of course you can’t buy me that same bag now that she owns it.  But I’ll settle for Dior or Gucci.”

He wasn’t falling for it.  “Seriously?”

“Seriously.”

“Steffi.”

“Are you telling me no?” she teased, bringing the playful banter to a merciful end.

“I’m saying no,” he said with an unusual resoluteness.

She smiled as she realized a newfound respect for him in the moment.  But at the same time, she was plotting to get her bag.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*

Mark felt like a stalker as he waited in the main lobby pretending to be preoccupied with his phone.  He was hoping to catch Yahira on her way out.  For the past week, she had been uncharacteristically distant with him.  He had no choice but to behave accordingly, which while friendly was also strictly professional.  She even continually blew him off for lunch with flimsy excuses.

Eventually he saw her walk toward the exit and they smiled at each other.

“Good night, Mark,” she said as she neared the main doors.

“Hey, do you have a minute to chat?”

“Yes, walk with me to my car.  I’m in a bit of a hurry to get home.”

As they exited the building, he knew there was only a few minutes—he wasted no time.  “Yahira, is everything alright?”

“Yes, of course.  Why do you ask?”

“You’ve seemed distracted this past week.”

She realized she couldn’t keep avoiding an explanation for her odd behavior.  She stopped in her tracks and turned to him.   She told him there was some strife going on with her husband due to recent events, although she didn’t go into details.  And when it came to work, she just needed to remain focused for her own sanity.  What was left unspoken was clear—she and Mark would need to remain professional going forward.

She reached out and touched his arm almost apologetically.  “See you at tomorrow’s staff meeting.”  She finally stepped in and gave him a hug, which felt very much like something had just ended.",1,1728655204.0,paypigsupportgroup,1,1.0,False

Hey fellow Reddit wanderers! Derek here, AKA u/solopassions, and I'm here to spill the beans on my wild solo travel escapades and why YOU should seriously consider taking that leap of faith, sans companions!

First off, let me paint you a picture: there's yours truly, an intrepid solo traveler with a heart full of wanderlust but a head hopelessly prone to confusing train schedules. My solo journey took me to the vibrant heart of Toronto, where I checked into the legendary Planet Traveler Hostel. Hint: If you're like me and get lost easily, it's fantastically central, making 'lost' a little less inevitable. 😅

Navigating the world alone was a riot of unmatched experiences, from arguing with a vending machine in multiple languages (turns out my French accent is dreadful!) to discovering secret coffee spots that made my soul sing. A one-man mission of accidental cultural exchanges, if you will. 😂

The best part about traveling solo? The epic reinvention of YOU. Seriously, nothing pushes you out of your comfort zone like getting asked for directions and somehow stammering your way into a new friendship. Striking up conversations with fellow travelers at the hostel's cozy lounge opened my world to stories from all corners—stories that rival any Netflix show! From discovering the best poutine joints to swapping travel hacks, these interactions reshaped my view on people, culture, and my own capabilities.

Solo travel majorly cranked up the volume on my self-reliance, decision-making confidence, and even my culinary skills (shoutout to the hostel's communal kitchen for becoming my stage for a truly international cuisine showdown).

But let’s keep it light and real. Here are my tips for those eyeing their own adventure:
1. **Channel Your Inner MacGyver**: Learn to improvise—whether it's turning your sarong into a picnic blanket or a coat (trust me, you'll need both).
2. **Smile Till It Hurts**: It's the universal language. Smiles get you places Google Maps can’t.
3. **Pack an Open Mind**: Forget FOMO; embrace JOTO (Joy of Tuning Out). No one cares if you missed the *“Top 10 Things”*—you just curated the unofficial *“Top YOU Things”*!

So, what are you waiting for? Slip on those travel boots and let your adventure shape the tale you'll share. Solo travel isn’t just a journey across lands; it's a voyage into your own potential and an exploration of endless connections.

And hey, if anyone's swinging by Planet Traveler Hostel anytime soon, save me a spot at game night—I've got a Scrabble rematch pending. 😉

Safe travels and wild stories, fellow explorers!

She got depressed and then cheated. She wasn´t honest with me about it, then after a few weeks called me saying she missed me and wanted to so me. It was so soon after the breakup, and I just wanted to repair things so we got together for a few dates. She needed time to think, but told me here intention was to try to date with me again. After a few weeks of not hearing from her I called her and she told me she didn´t know yet, after which I said that´s ok but I´ll move on then. A week later I learned from her sister that she was still seeing the guy she cheated with. We got together for a coffee and she told me she was done. Since then I had a few terrible months. This last month I felt better and started to date again, but now I feel like I have more frequent days where I miss her so much, then a day where I am so angry and upset. It feels like it never goes away, I am so tired of feeling this way. I started therapy a few weeks after the breakup, lost 20 Kg, got into really good shape and have a new job that pays better. But it feels so hollow. I have this thought loop, that nothing really matters and nobody is such a good match as she is. I know realistically that that is not true, but it feels so true. I never had a breakup this bad in my life. I feel so worthless and replaced. I feel so terribly alone. My emotions are so high all the damn time. I feel so depressed. 

I am sorry for this rant but I really wanted to get it off my chest. Hope that is ok. English is not my first language so sorry for any spelling mistakes. ",1,1728654801.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False
1g1abcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1g1abcx/the_silent_one_part_12/,The Silent One (part 1/2),"Another work week had come to an end. Antony Collins closed his folder with documents of his very recent case and put it back on the shelf with all the rest. With a single press on the off button, he quickly turned his work computer off. And finally, lights off, and locking of his office meant a beginning of the weekend. Antony loved the Fridays.

He rode his car through the streets enlightened with bright street lights under the already dark night sky. The people were out to have a great time at some bar or to have a nice dinner at some restaurant, or to just walk around.

Even the best lawyers in town deserve some great time out, he said to himself while entering the parking lot of the Ragussa Pub.

Inside, the atmosphere was electric with anticipation and the release of a long week’s tension. It was warm and lively, with a sense of camaraderie and shared relief that ripples through the room. It was dimly lit with dark wood beams, exposed brick walls, and a long, polished bar lined with stools. Tables were scattered across the scuffed floor, and a cozy, timeworn atmosphere filled the snug, intimate space.

Now he was looking for his table, and there it was. At the corner, by the big window that was opening towards a wonderful sight to the harbor. His group’s favorite place.

“Hey, lil’ hustler!” Jim greeted him, raising his pint.

“Joke’s on you, I’m getting paid overtime,” Anthony grinned, taking a sip of his beer.

“Overtime? For what? Filing complaints about our coffee machine?” Sarah teased.

“Nah, for making sure you guys don’t get sued after nights like this.” Anthony winked.

“Cheers to our future defense attorney!” Jim laughed, clinking glasses.

The night went the best it could. The three lawyers needed that beer and relief after their exhausting working week.

Anthony was now driving slowly and carefully looking for police patrolling somewhere. Even being among the best lawyers in the town with the experience and skills that he had, he couldn’t defend himself from getting his driving lisence taken for drunk driving. Still he felt sober enough to drive back home.

The neighborhood was quiet. Only the soft rustling of leaves could be heard under the gentle breeze, and his footsteps crunching through the fallen leaves seemed the loudest sound in the stillness. But then, everything stopped. The wind died down abruptly, leaving an eerie silence hanging in the air. Anthony paused, his senses on edge. The only sound now was his own racing heartbeat. Something felt off.

“Maybe four pints was one too many,” he muttered to himself, trying to shake off the unease. With a nervous chuckle, he headed inside for some much-needed sleep.

Sunday was a fishing day, and a day to drive the Chevy truck. Anthony drove past Jim’s house, the truck bed loaded with gear, and together they headed to the small pond just outside town. The air was crisp, with the scent of pine and damp soil, and the trees surrounding the water were ablaze with autumn colors: fiery reds, vibrant oranges, and golden yellows reflected in the still surface of the pond. The sulence was only broken by the occasional rustle of leaves and the soft plop of a fish jumping.

Anthony cast his line, watching the bobber float peacefully. “You know, Jim,” he said, “sometimes I think about quitting the law and just doing this for a living.”
Jim snorted. “Fishing?”

“Yeah,” Anthony grinned. “Think about it. No deadlines, no paperwork. Just us, the fish, and that one beaver over there that probably hates us.”

Jim laughed, casting his own line. “Sure, but you’d miss the thrill of defending people who can’t tell a lie from a laminated document.”

“True,” Anthony admitted. “But at least out here, the only thing trying to bite me is the fish.”

“Don’t forget the mosquitoes,” Jim added, swatting at his arm. “I’m pretty sure they’re on retainer.”

Anthony chuckled. “Guess they don’t know I’m billing them for overtime, too.”

But Jim didn’t respond. He kept silent instead. The occassional buzz of the mosquitoes vanished. The jumping of the fish stopped. No sound could be heard for a moment. Anthony looked around. The silence seemed so unnatural and so oppressive, as if it was pressing down on his chest, making his breathing heavy and his heartbeat stong enough so he would feel it in his ears.

But it went away, all of a sudden. Anthony could swear that he saw a silhouette between the trees on the oposite side of the pond, but Jim seemed that he didn’t notice anything. And as Anthony turned his head back to the water, something pulled his bait down in the pond. He pulled it back firmly, and there it was, a catfish almost a meter long, pulling against the fishing reel.

Jim jumped out of excitement.

“Well done, lil’ hustler!”, Jim yelled, while grabbing the big hook on a long, wooden handle to help Anthony pull the fish out of the water.

They were happy to catch a great dinner. In the evening that followed, Jim was in Anthony’s kitchen helping him with the cooking.

As they sat down to dinner, Anthony served the golden-brown catfish alongside crispy hushpuppies and a fresh salad.

“Here’s to a successful catch and a great dinner!” Anthony raised his glass, and Jim joined in, clinking his drink against Anthony’s.

“Cheers to our fishing skills! May our next catch be even bigger,” Jim added with a grin, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

They dug into the meal, the tender catfish was flaky and flavorful. Between bites, they talked about the day’s adventures, recounting how Jim had almost lost his balance while trying to help pull the fish with the hook.

“I swear I saw you about to take a dip!” Anthony laughed, wiping his mouth. “Next time, I’ll tie you to a tree.”

“Only if you promise to jump in after me if I go overboard!” Jim shot back, chuckling. 
“Deal!” Anthony replied, raising his glass again.

As they continued to eat, the conversation flowed effortlessly, filled with inside jokes and teasing. The warmth of friendship enveloped them, making the simple meal feel like a feast.

“Man, if every Sunday was like this, I’d never want to go back to work,” Jim said, leaning back contentedly in his chair.

“Agreed,” Anthony said, smiling. “Just us, the fish, and no emails.” 

The laughter and joy lingered long into the evening, leaving behind memories of a perfect day spent together. But one thing was was unclear to Anthony. Was he losing his mind?

Monday arrived, and Anthony was back in his office like every other workday. The low hum of the fluorescent lights provided a familiar, almost comforting presence, buzzing softly in every corner of the building. He was buried in a complex case, papers strewn across his desk as he tried to make sense of the overwhelming evidence. The mental strain finally caught up with him, and a sudden, pounding headache hit him hard. Standing up too quickly, he felt dizzy and nauseous.

The walk to the bathroom felt endless as his steps wobbled unsteadily. Just as he reached the door of his office, everything went silent, abruptly, unnaturally. That same uneasy feeling crept up his spine, like he was being watched. His heart skipped as he saw it again, a silhouette, standing motionless in front of the bathroom door at the end of the hall. 

He blinked, rubbing his eyes, and it vanished. The strange feeling lifted with it, the nausea fading. The hum of the lights returned, and the world felt normal again. But Anthony couldn’t shake the lingering chill that remained.

“Hey, buddy,” Jim called out from his office, peeking from behind the door. “You all right?”

Anthony leaned against the wall, still trying to catch his breath. “Yeah, man. I’m good,” he replied, his voice sounding exhausted and distant.

Jim stepped closer, his eyes widening as he got a better look at Anthony. “You’re pale like a dead man,” he said, quickly closing the distance between them. “Seriously, what’s up?”

Anthony forced a weak smile and put a hand on Jim’s shoulder. “I’m totally alright,” he said, trying to sound convincing. “Just… overworked. Too many late nights.”

Before Jim could respond, Sarah appeared at the end of the hall. Her eyes flicked nervously between the two of them, taking in Anthony’s pale face and uneasy stance.

“Hey, Anthony,” she said, her voice a little higher than usual. “You okay? You don’t look so good.”

“I’m fine,” Anthony insisted, straightening up and trying to sound more normal. “Just a headache. It’s nothing.”

Sarah hesitated, glancing around the hallway nervously. “Are you sure? You really don’t look well.”

“Yeah, I promise,” Anthony said, forcing another smile. “I just need to get some air, maybe grab a coffee.”

Jim still looked skeptical, but he nodded slowly. “Okay, but don’t push yourself, man. You really look like you need a break.”

Sarah nodded in agreement, her gaze darting around the hall again before she looked back at Anthony. “Yeah, take it easy. It’s just… you seem really out of it today.”

Anthony sighed, feeling the weight of their concern. “I’ll be fine,” he reassured them, though the words felt hollow. He could see the doubt in their eyes, especially Sarah’s, who kept glancing around as if she was searching for something.

“Okay,” she said softly, still watching him carefully. “But if you need anything, just let us know.”

“Thanks, guys,” Anthony said, his voice a little more steady now. “I appreciate it.”

As the days passed, Anthony couldn’t shake the unsettling feeling of being watched. As if the sudden silences weren’t unnerving enough, it was the shadowy silhouette that kept appearing, lingering at the edge of his vision, that truly disturbed him. None of it made any sense, yet the occurrences grew more frequent, each one tightening the grip of anxiety and paranoia around him. Was he losing his mind?

One rainy night, the three of them gathered at their usual pub. The storm outside was relentless, raindrops tapping steadily against the windows as if trying to join the conversation. The warm light inside contrasted sharply with the gloomy weather, casting a cozy glow over the group as they took their drinks.

Anthony took a long sip of his beer and then, after weeks of holding it in, finally spoke up. “I’ve been seeing something,” he began, his voice low but serious. Jim and Sarah looked up from their glasses, curious.

“Seeing what?” Jim asked, raising an eyebrow.

Anthony hesitated, then took a deep breath. “A shadowy figure. It’s been appearing around me, at home, at work. And every time, everything goes completely silent. No sound, nothing. It’s… it’s like the world just stops.”

Jim snorted, shaking his head with a smile. “You’ve been watching too many horror movies, man,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “Come on, you’re telling us you’ve got your own personal ghost now?”

But Sarah’s expression didn’t change. She stayed silent, her eyes locked on Anthony as if trying to gauge how serious he was. “When did this start?” she asked quietly.

“A few weeks ago,” Anthony replied, glancing around nervously. “It’s been happening more often lately. I didn’t want to say anything because it sounds crazy, but I swear it’s real.”

Jim rolled his eyes. “Okay, so let me get this straight. You see a shadow, everything goes quiet, and what? This thing just stands there staring at you?”

“Pretty much,” Anthony said, looking down at his hands. “It’s like it’s watching me, waiting for something.”

“Sounds like a bad dream,” Jim said, dismissing it with a wave. “I bet it’s just stress messing with your head.”

Before Anthony could respond, a heavy silence fell over the pub, so abrupt that it was almost tangible. The usual chatter, the clinking of glasses, even the rain outside, all of it ceased. The three of them froze, eyes widening in unison. Also, all the other patrons stared outside, utterly silent.

Then, through the pub’s large front window, they saw it: a tall, dark figure standing motionless across the street, barely illuminated by the streetlights. Its faceless silhouette seemed to blend into the shadows, an unsettling presence that sent a shiver down Anthony’s spine.

Jim’s face went pale as he stared at the figure. “What the hell is that?” he whispered, his voice barely audible.

Anthony swallowed hard, his throat dry. “That’s what I’ve been talking about,” he said shakily. “That’s it.”

Sarah, who had been watching the figure intently, suddenly looked at Anthony with something like fear in her eyes. “We need to talk,” she said, her voice urgent and trembling. “In private.”

And all of a sudden, all the sounds came back.

“Why? What’s going on?” Jim asked, as much confused as he was scared.

“Now,” she insisted, grabbing Anthony’s arm and pulling him away from the table. They hurried towards a quieter corner of the pub, leaving Jim staring after them, his expression a mixture of confusion and dread.

“What do you know about this?” Anthony demanded as soon as they were alone, his heart pounding.

Sarah glanced over her shoulder, then back at him, her eyes were wide, filled with fear. “It’s called The Silent One,” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the ambient noise of the pub. “It’s not just a ghost or a figment of your imagination. It’s a summoned entity, a kind of dark spirit that obeys the will of whoever calls it.”

“A summoned entity?” Anthony repeated, struggling to comprehend. “How do you summon something like that?”

Sarah looked around again, as if she feared the walls themselves were listening. “There’s a ritual,” she said quietly. “It involves candles, blood, and a specific incantation. The person performing the ritual has to offer their own blood as fail-safe and stay absolutely silent until the job is done. The moment they make a sound, even the faintest whisper, The Silent One turns on them instead.”

“The job?” Anthony was confused. “What do you mean?”

Sarah continued. “A job is given to the entity to kill someone you ask it to. The blood of the victim is offered to it. But if the summoner breaks any rule, mostly the silence rule, The Silent One turns against them.”

Anthony felt his skin crawl. “How do you know all this?”

She hesitated, her eyes distant as if remembering something painful. “Because it happened to me once,” she said, her voice breaking slightly.

Anthony stared at her, stunned. “What? When?”

“A few years ago,” she said, glancing down at her trembling hands. “I defended this guy in court. A real psychopath. He killed eleven people in a mall shooting. I tried to get his sentence reduced, but I failed. He got life in prison.”

She took a deep breath, steadying herself before continuing. “After the trial, I started seeing things, just like you’re describing. The shadow, the silence. I thought I was losing my mind. Then, I got a call from the prison. They told me the man had performed some sort of ritual in his cell, calling it to kill me.”

Anthony’s heart sank. “But you’re still here.”

Sarah nodded, swallowing hard. “He broke the silence rule,” she said, her voice trembling. “He couldn’t keep quiet, even with his life on the line. He couldn’t resist to brag about it to the guards, and that was enough. The Silent One turned on him and… slit his throat with its silver knife. The guards saw it happen. They couldn’t explain it, but they saw it.”

Anthony’s mind was racing. “Is there any way to stop it?”

Sarah shook her head slowly, her eyes filled with despair. “No, Anthony. Once it’s summoned, it won’t stop until it’s done. But there’s one thing you can do to delay it: stay silent. It hunts by sound. If you stay quiet, you can keep it from coming closer. It’ll stay at the distance it’s already at, but it won’t go away. It’s just… delayed.”

Anthony felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead. “So, I just… don’t speak?”

Sarah nodded. “Exactly. But it’s only a temporary solution. It’s still out there, waiting. The silence just holds it off. It can’t make it leave.”

He took a deep breath, feeling trapped. “And the person who summoned it? They have to stay silent too?”

“Yes,” Sarah said. “One sound, and it turns on them. That’s how it works. The question is…” she looked at him, her expression dark with fear, “who would go through all of that to summon it for you, Anthony? Who wants you dead so badly that they’d risk their own life?”",1,1728654778.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1g1aad5,https://www.reddit.com/r/budget/comments/1g1aad5/how_much_money_is_it_okay_to_blow/,How much money is it okay to blow?,"Hello! 22M here in Toronto.

I'm, in practice, a full time student with a part time job. I tend to make something like $1300 to $1800 monthly these days (since I'm not full time anymore), and I expect to continue making that amount all throughout this final year of University (up to April). My side hustles also net me something like $120 to $250 a month. 

I will graduate with something like $8000 in 0% interest student loans. I expect to be fully employed after I graduate, whether that's something in my desired careeer path or just waiting tables to tide me over.

Thanks to a grant I'm receiving, I have whittled my rent down to $560/month up until April. I pay $100 in utilities, and I save pretty aggressively (depends on how much I earn; last month I socked away $500 of my $2300 paycheck). I am of course making sure I have money for the essentials (groceries, transit fare (though I bike most journeys), etc.). I am working on my emergency fund now and it's up to $2900 with a stated goal of $6000. (I also have $350 in investments).

In many ways, I'm a pretty frugal guy. I basically never buy clothes, I don't impulse buy stuff on Amazon, when I need or want something new like a gadget or a game or a new lightbulb, I research and agonize for days. 

However, my achilles heel is food and beverage. If you looked at my discretionary spending for the last 30 days you would observe that the overwhelming majority of it is cafes, bars, restaurants.

So herein lies my dilemma. On the one hand I want to enjoy life, go out sometimes, buy friends a coffee, and crack open a beer after a long day out in the field. 

But on the other hand, I went *completely* broke back in spring and was in an uncomfortable amount of consumer debt. It took a long time to crawl out of that. To be fair, I wasn't working at the time, but it is very important to me that this never happens again. So I cannot help but feel irresponsible when I write my monthly budget and I allocate such huge figures like $100, $150, or even $200 under categories like ""Discretionary"", ""Entertainment"", etc. when I know that it's mostly going to be wasted.

This is my second attempt at budgeting. I really feel like I'm sticking to it so far after two weeks, but the month is far from over and some of these figures are creeping up.

So here's my overall question: for someone in my position, **how much money is it okay to blow?** I am not uncomfortable with my current 0 APR debt situation, and I don't feel a need to hardcore debt snowball it ala Dave Ramsey since inflation will eat away at it and I will never pay interest, but damn. I do feel a bit of discomfort sometimes looking at my expense spreadsheet and seeing $30 pub nights and $5 lattes. That money could be doing so much more.",1,1728654698.0,budget,0,1.0,False

Hope you all are happy and healthy.

Reposting for visibility - here's to optimism and not giving up.

I am a 35 year old single nerd (yes, very unique on reddit), both in personal and professional life. I am an expat living in the Netherlands but originally from India(oh dear, Indian, run away!! )

Still here?... well read on..

I have been away from home for more than 12 years, for both educational and professional reasons. Last 2 years were spent in the Netherlands. I am not sure where I will be tomorrow - perhaps back in Asia or US - life takes you places, but I am here for now and the loneliness is getting to me. It has been a year since I dated anyone and I am finally at a point where both mind and body desire some affection and intimacy. I am just looking for a connection - be it only friendship with the possibility of something more, but a connection nonetheless.

More about me:

On a fitness journey. Trying to work out at least 4 days a week and eating healthy. I am getting stronger but the latter is not going so well as I absolutely love food - I think it is the single greatest pleasure of life. Would love to connect with someone who is also into fitness or at least seriously considering getting into it so we can encourage each other as opposed to enabling the bad habits.

I like the usual nerdy things - gaming, fantasy and sci-fiction, manga, and the occasional anime. Not a requirement that you be a nerd but it helps :)

I am a lifelong tourist, love traveling and enjoy road trips. Been to over 30 countries, always looking forward to my next vacation, and want to see the whole world!

Other details about me:

* Introvert
* Much more shy and socially awkward than I would like to be :p
* Politically liberal/left
* Don't smoke or drink alcohol, but coffee is my poison!
* Vegetarian
* Love touch and adore cuddles :)
* Non Vanilla, but that is for (much) later ;)

I am generally an easy going and an agreeable person, but strong religious inclinations and an anti-science mindset are absolute deal breakers. This is already too long so lastly, I am looking for something IRL and would prefer speaking to people who are in the Netherlands or within day-trip distances.

If my post resonates with you, do reach out and please leave an introduction.

I am usually semi-aware of doing this but sometimes I only have a foggy memory when I wake up in the morning. I have also had episodes of starting the coffee machine at 2 AM and getting changed/brushing my teeth. Sometimes it feels as though I have to convince myself it’s safe to go back to sleep, and other times my heart rate is more elevated, and I wake up fully. In 2022, I ran into a piece of furniture and hurt my leg, needing stitches (I've rearranged my room to hopefully prevent further issues).

I have been sleepwalking every night for the past 5 nights, and I'm fairly concerned about the cause. Is this possible or likely to be neurological, but worsened by stress?

* I read that Lexapro can worsen parasomnias -- I started Lexapro at a low dose (5mg) about 2 months ago to help with anxiety and also to hopefully **reduce** these episodes. My mood has been better but the sleepwalking has continued.
* I'm not particularly stressed right now.
* I get plenty of sleep -- 7-8 hours.
* I do have GERD but it's mostly under control.
* I rarely drink and don't smoke or use drugs.
* I don't think I have sleep apnea -- a recent pulse oximetry test was negative.
* No history of sleepwalking as a child. My mom did sleepwalk as a child, though. I have a history of talking in my sleep as well as bruxism.
* Not sure if relevant, but I was diagnosed with PCOS last year.
* I've also been dealing with worsening nystagmus.

I do have an appointment set up to discuss with my PCP but need to make it through the next few weeks before then. I'd appreciate any insight on possible causes or things to consider!!",1,1728653808.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

My (29f) partner and I have previously broken up for almost a year before getting back together. 

A month or so after getting back together, after he was on a night out, I saw a text on his phone from an unknown girl saying that they should get a coffee. When I confronted him, he said that she was struggling with her mental health and he wanted to help her. I told him I don’t believe that and he needs to not contact her again. 

A few months later, on a night out, he says that after coming back from the bathroom he was me flirting and almost kissing another man. This is something that he claims had also happened previously. I however have no recollection of either (I have changed my relationship with alcohol since this). 

Months after these incidents we moved in together. He has been distant recently and after speaking with him, he says that my instances of almost indefinitely have now dawned on him and he is unsure if he can work past it. He is hoping to attend counselling to work through this however he doesn’t believe it will work. 

I hope that he will also agree to going to therapy together but when I have suggested this previously he has refused. I just feel so lost, our last breakup almost killed me and I know that is my fault, but I don’t know how I can go through this again. Up until a couple of months ago we were talking about marriage and kids and now I think he’s going to walk away again. His previous marriage broke down, a lot due to her cheating. 

What steps can I take to get us through this?

TLDR: my partner says he saw me try to cheat on him whilst intoxicated, I have no recollection of this. A while later he doesn’t know if he can deal with it any longer.

&#x200B;

When the first sliver of daylight peeked over the tree line, I mustered every ounce of energy left in my aching, exhausted body and started shoveling like a madman. I wasn’t sure of the time, or how deep the hole was, since it had been a while since I’d measured. But I knew there was a lot more digging to do, so I pushed myself to go faster, fearful of incurring Kurt’s wrath if I didn’t make my deadline.

Thankfully, my father-in-law had been correct when he said the soil would get softer as I dug deeper. Since the ground was frozen, it took five hours to excavate just two feet, and I was scared to death I wouldn’t get the job done by 9 the next morning. But the task got easier after a while and I made good time, working through the night and stopping only for three coffee-slash-bathroom breaks, and to wolf down a paltry dinner.

The refrigerator in the cabin was stocked with provisions for the upcoming Thanksgiving feast, although Kurt had told me I was restricted to eating what was in the basket on the kitchen floor: A banana, two apples and a small can of tuna. I ate half the tuna, half the banana and one of the apples for supper, deciding to save the rest for breakfast when I’d finished the job, since I wasn’t sure when I’d get another chance to eat after that.

Digging a hole in the winter was backbreaking work, but it still left time to think about my depressing situation, so to quiet the voices in my head, I started singing at the top of my lungs. The cabin was in the middle of nowhere, so I wasn’t worried about being heard by human ears.

What a sight I must have been, digging at dusk by lanternlight as fast as I could, while warbling out of tune like a deranged idiot.

At sunrise, I measured how deep I’d dug, and was shocked that I’d already gone down 9 feet, exceeding Kurt’s order by a full foot. With a self-satisfied smile, I wandered into the cabin and peered at the coo-coo clock above the sprawling stone fireplace. It was just 7:30, meaning I had a full hour-and-a-half to eat the rest of my food and relax.

Then, like a true wimp, I started second-guessing myself. Kurt had told me to dig 8 feet, and I wondered whether he’d get mad that I’d not followed his order to the letter, rather than being pleased that I’d gone the extra mile. In the end, my beta instincts took over, and, playing it safe, I threw dirt back in the hole until it measured 8 feet exactly. 

With the first part of the job finally done, I trudged back into the nice, warm cabin and curled up on the couch. I had worked for 18 hours straight, and was absolutely wiped out, so it took only a few seconds to fall into dreamland, where visions of my beloved Elena floated through the blackness …. the softness of her hair … her dazzling, ultra-white smile … her incredible, curvaceous body … the sound of her voice …

“COMFY, ARE WE??”

The masculine bark jolted me awake. 

Kurt stood over me frowning. “Who the hell said you could sleep on the couch, fat boy?”

I jumped to my feet. “S-sorry, sir.”

Tom shook his head. “What a wimp.”

“You got that right.” Kurt pointed toward the back of the cabin. “Did you get that hole dug like I told you to?”

“Yes, sir.”

“Eight feet?”

“Yes, sir.”

He patted me on the head. “See? You ain’t totally useless.”

That got a laugh out of my father-in-law. “Oh, I don’t know Kurt — Elena says he’s pretty useless.”

Kurt waved his hand. “Nah, Tubby’s good for a lot of stuff. Ain’t you, Tubby?”

“Uh, um, I think so.”

“Tell Tom what you’re good at.”

I worked my tongue around the inside of my mouth. “I … well, I’m pretty good at predicting stock trends.”

Tom scoffed. “Yeah, that fancy job is the only reason my daughter married you. I must’ve heard 10 people at your wedding say ‘she’s only with him for his money.’ It wasn’t exactly some huge secret, was it?”

“Um … I guess not.”

Kurt smacked me upside the head. “Call him ‘sir’ when you answer him, fat ass.”

“Yes, sir,” I replied, rubbing my noggin.

Tom nodded regally. “I knew Elena would end up leaving you someday. My little girl is a free spirit, and she can’t be tied down forever to a man she doesn’t love, money or not. I’m proud of her — and I’m sure as hell glad she met Kurt here. My Elena finally got the kind of man she deserves, instead of a fat piece of shit like you.”

“Aw, shucks, Tom, Roger’s not so bad.”  Kurt regarded me with a twinkle in his eye. “He’s good at more than stocks and bonds shit. He’s a great little maid — ain’t you?”

“Uh, yes, sir.”

“My shoes have never shined so good.”

“Um, thank you, sir.”

“I have him come over to my place once a week to clean,” Kurt explained to Tom.

My father-in-law rolled his eyes. “I still can’t get over what kind of a man allows this shit. I always knew this fat bastard wasn’t much, but I never realized anyone could be so fucking pathetic.”

Kurt leaned in closer to his older companion. “You want to know how pathetic he really is?”

Tom leered. “Sure. I can only imagine.”

Kurt grinned. “I’m making him give me his balls for Christmas.”

Tom’s eyes got big. “Say, what? His balls?”

“Yeah, I want him to be a eunuch. I don’t trust him living with Elena otherwise, even if he is sleeping in the garage. It’ll be like the old Roman emperor days, when they had eunuchs serving their queens.”

It was all I could do to keep from crying when I realized Kurt hadn’t been kidding — he really wanted me to go through with the orchiectomy.

My father-in-law turned to me. “And you’re actually gonna do this to yourself?”

I hung my head. “Y-yes.”

“You are one pathetic piece of shit, you know that?” Tom spat in my face.

Kurt cracked up. “Bullseye!”

While the two men laughed at me, I stood there like an oaf, tears mingling with my father-in-law’s spittle.

Kurt touched Tom’s sleeve. “Hey, don’t tell Elena I told you, okay? She wasn’t sure we should let you and Linda know; she was scared you guys might think it’s too weird.”

“Elena worries too much — she was afraid we wouldn’t accept you and fat-ass here all living together, too, but we’re not as old-fashioned as she thinks.”

“Well, I appreciate it. I really do love your daughter, Tom, and I wanted this all to be okay with you and Linda.”

“I can tell you love her — I knew as soon as I saw you two together. And Linda, she just loves you, and she loves how happy you make Elena. It always bothered us that she married for money, because we knew she wasn’t happy.”

His words hit me like a right cross to the jaw, since all I’d ever wanted was to make my wife happy. But seeing how blissful she was with Kurt had also caused me to accept myself as a beta, submit to them both and support their relationship — even if it meant heartache and humiliation for me.

Tom looked at me. “So, how are you gonna have it done? The operation?”

“I … uh, I haven’t really thought about it, sir.”

“Well, you damn well better start thinking about it,” Kurt snapped. “Set something up with one of them doctors. Say you want to become a woman.”

“OMG, can you imagine this fat fuck as a woman?” Tom made a face. 

“Oh, I dunno.” Kurt rubbed his chin dramatically. “Some guys like them mushy butt-cheeks.”

The quip caused Tom to choke from laughing so hard.

Kurt clapped twice. “All right, Tubby, come out back and show us the hole you dug.”

I felt proud as I led my wife’s lover and my father-in-law out of the cabin and across the snow toward the site of my toil — especially when Kurt smiled upon seeing my handiwork. 

“Nice job, Tubs.” He clapped me on the back. “Now, you get to do the rest. You have until 3 to get it done — we’ll be back from the motel by then, and I can get that pipe fixed before sundown, so everyone can crash here and have a nice Thanksgiving tomorrow. You hear me, fat boy? Three o’clock.”

“Yes, sir.”

As Kurt and Tom started to walk away, I cleared my throat. “Uh … sir?”

Kurt stopped in his tracks. “What, Tubby?”

“Um, sir … is there anything I can eat for lunch?”

“You ate what I left you in the basket already?”

“Y-yes, sir.”

Kurt turned to Tom. “I dunno, what do you think? Does Tubs here deserve some lunch?”

Tom shook his head. “Nah, fuck him. He obviously ain’t starving.”

Kurt smirked at me and shrugged. “Sorry, Roger. No soup for you! Now, get to digging.”

The two men strolled toward the front of the cabin laughing. I bit back tears and muttered ‘fuck you’ under my breath at my hateful father-in-law before grabbing the shovel and attacking the soil with a vengeance. 

After working out my frustrations on Mother Earth, it dawned on me that my beloved Elena would be arriving at the cabin at 3 o’clock, which was why I had to be finished by then. I didn’t even care that her bitch of a mother and her two evil little sisters would be coming, too — I dug the rest of the hole with a smile on my face.

So..My husband and I are in our early 30s, married since 2020, with no kids.

We’re in a long-distance marriage: I live in Spain, and he’s based in the Philippines for work. I work remotely, so I visit him once a year and stay for months—in fact, I’m in the Philippines right now. But even when I’m here, he flies to China and Hong Kong every few weeks for business, usually for 4 days to just over a week.

We chose this setup because of our careers, but of course, the end goal is to live together in Europe within the next year or two.

Here’s the thing: when we’re apart, we rarely communicate. No voice or video calls, just a few WhatsApp messages here and there, and barely any photos. Maybe it’s a trust thing? 

When we’re together, though, everything’s great. We don’t argue much, and we love bonding over silly Netflix shows or going on late-night coffee runs—those are our two favorite things to do. We’re both busy and beyond the phase of spending money on random leisure activities.

But sometimes I wonder if it’s normal that we don’t communicate much when we’re apart or we aren't worried much about being away from each other for long periods. For example, I’m even planning to spend New Year’s with a friend in Dubai to watch the fireworks at Burj Khalifa—without him. (He doesn’t want to deal with visa requirements, and luckily, I have a strong passport and don’t need one.) When people hear this, they act like it’s strange: “Why wouldn’t you spend New Year’s together like a proper married couple, especially when you can?” But honestly, we’re okay with it and don’t feel the need to explain ourselves. Sometimes I have this thought in my head that we're getting too cmfortable being like this? I mean many moons ago we weren't like this at all. We were inseparable and we lived together in one place for years.

### Training
I started running about a year ago exactly, in the fall of 2023. I had tried starting to run many times before, but for some reason I started to fall in love with it for the first time. It was an amazing de-stressor, I felt awesome afterwords and overall better about my self when working it in. Less depressed, gave me confidence and energy - just so much better mentally. I also felt  calmer and less anxious due to having an ""energy-releasing"" activity. Once I was able to run the length of my local park in full (7 miles) I knew I was ready to take on some new challenges since achieving that felt so good! I had a friend who had picked up running at around the same time and we both signed up for halfs and fulls, to give ourselves something to work for throughout the next year. 

I signed up for my first half in April of 2024, and subsequently my first full (this Maine Marathon). I thought if I had a year I'd have enough time to train, and it'd keep me running throughout the year. My first half came by and I got a time of 1:57:54 - following the 'Alien Method' in Jack Daniels book. I kept base building at around 30-40 mpw as I looked around for plans to do for my full marathon. I was between Hanson Beginner and Pfitz 18/55, and ended up going the latter since it usually had 5 days of running instead of 6. Starting off the block, I became a little nervous and thought I was over my head with picking this plan. The workouts (especially LT) were HARD - but I stuck with it. I missed a week or so in the start with vacation, but the amount of days missed fell within Pfitz range of being okay. The real block started after that, with 50+ weeks and 20 milers. Honestly, those weeks were good most of the time besides some brutal summer runs. I kept reminding myself that this would help with fall PRs! 

I trained for a 4:10 MP, doing 9:20 to 9:30 miles for my marathon pace workouts. As I got closer to the race I thought that I could push this, and make my stretch goal 4:00.

In the last 8 weeks of training, I missed about 2 days so I felt pretty good going into the race. Unfortunately, I look at my watch too much - and was getting discouraged with some of my vo2 max going down and race predictors going up. It also said I was ""peaking"" a couple weeks too early but I trusted my training and tried to ignore all these fancy metrics!

### Pre-race
We drove up to Portland on Thursday night, relaxed for a couple days and explored a bit before the race day.

The morning of the race I woke up to pee around 4:00AM (race wasn't till 7:45) and as you could guess I could not sleep again after this! The adrenaline was pulsing and I was ready to go. I ate some bread with peanut butter, banana, and honey and got a bit of coffee going. Once my friend who signed up with me was ready, we walked over to the starting line! It was a crispy 40 degrees and sunny, I was cold but knew this was perfect running weather. We got to the start line and I aligned myself in between the 4:00 and 4:20 pacers, and my friend headed closer to the 5 hour pacers. The national anthem played, and we were off!

### Race
The first 6 or so miles were great, crowd support was fantastic and everything was going smoothly. I was freezing to start, so it felt great to get moving. By around Mile 5 or 6 I felt like I was in a groove and finally warmed up. My first thought was that this course was not as flat as I thought. We moved up and down through rolling hills throughout 6 through 13 and I knew I'd be cursing some of these on the way back. In my head I split the race into 3 9 milers, and wanted to try to push the pace whenever we got to the next 9. 

At 14mi-15mi I saw my friend since it was an out and back, and we let out a loud cheer for each other which gave me a nice boost. I made sure to drink water at every single aid station, and ate either a Honey Stinger, or Clif Bloks every 45 minutes. Additionally, I took a saltstick electrolye pill every 45 minutes. This fueling did me well I think, as I never really hit the ""wall"". I kept trucking along and eventually hit 20, the most I'd ever ran. I knew this is where the real race would start.

I remembered one section of Pfitz that mentioned that with our superior training, we'd be ready for the last 6 miles. He mentioned to pick a victim in the distance, and try to pass them. Continue this with more people for the last 6 miles. I envisioned this moment for a while, and he was completely right. I figured if I had anything left in the tank, I should leave it all in these last 6 (as you can see from my splits) thankfully, most of the last 6 was a nice downhill as well so I was letting the momentum take me. I must have passed 15+ people in this last stretch, and I really felt great that I was able to push! Pfitz was correct, haha. The bibs noted if it was our first marathon, and hearing a stranger go ""yeahhhh get that first one"" gave me a nice push. The pain really started around 22-23mi. I started feeling some cramps coming up everytime I slowed down, in my foot and in my hamstring. I knew that I just had to keep running to stop this from happening so that was another motivator! Also felt a small blister coming in a common spot I'd gotten before in these shoes, so just tried to adjust my gait a bit and fight against that.

At around 24-25mi, I got a notification from racejoy that my expected finish time was 3:59:59 - and I pushed with everything I had left. I still thought that sub-4 may be possible after the halfway point, but didn't think it was this close to in range. I sprinted as much as I could the last two miles, somehow hitting 7:30 paces for small stretches and finally crossed the finish line!

Chip time was officially 4:01:47, although Strava seems to think I broke sub 4. I think I may have with some weaving around and adding (watch and strava said 26.52) but I will go with the chip time. Honestly I smashed my goal from starting (4:10) so I couldn't be mad at all. An official sub-4 is def in my future!

### Post-race
I went it to a short state of emotional and physical shock after, just being thankful and not believing that I actually ran a marathon. My fiancee was at the finish line which was amazing, and we sat for a bit and got the post-race snacks. After feeling relatively back to normal, I headed to the beer garden and waited for my friend to finish! Once he crossed, we all relaxed at the finishing area for a bit before going back to our AirBnb, and relaxing on the couch. After some hours of doing nothing we all destroyed a Mexican dinner later at night. The feeling of finishing this feat was awesome, and I did have a strong emotional moment back at the Airbnb after the finish. I was just so happy so many of my friends & family wanted to track me and support me on this goal. Their words after meant so much. I started thinking about myself from a year ago, 2 years, 10 years ago. If you told that guy he'd run a marathon someday he'd be really confused and shocked, lol. So that held a lot of weight for me and I was super thankful and proud of myself.

Unfortunately, as a person who watches my watch too much - somehow my fitness is apparently declining and vo2 max is going down. Not sure how that's possible with running an almost sub-4 marathon. Oh well - this happened during the transition to summer too so maybe my body doesn't do too well with the weather changes.

Now, I'm following Pfitz recovery schedule and giving myself some time to think of a new goal. I love running so I defintely want to continue. Maybe I'll get my half time down, or work to a 50k distance, work in some trails, not really sure. I'll let myself rest a bit before deciding that. Since I technically PR'd my half on the second half of the marathon I think it makes sense to maybe work on my half time! Again, going to rest on it a bit before committing to anything. Thanks to anyone who read! Appreciate this community so much. <3

Doesn’t speak much just stand and drink coffee and this has been going on for a while. But this Monday she showed up on insta feed and sent her a follow request, and now it’s Friday and she hasn’t accepted it yet. I’m unclear of the next steps now.

I could go one or two days without, but it would always come back. 

I'm going through a lot of things, mainly a breakup and simply trying to rely on myself and become emotionally independent, while trying to recognize what I want from life, and what things make me happy. 

I started doin IFS with a therapist months ago and I was frustrated that it wasn't working as fast as I wanted to. I don't think I unburdened a single exile, and I still don't believe it's possible.

But I am sometimes able to regulate myself, to notice and soothe pain, to talk to parts when an unhealthy longing came up. 

So after some time I stopped trying to fight the part that wants to be on the internet in the morning. In fact, I embraced it. It's one of the joys of my day — to make a cup of coffee and go on reddit. Yes, when it goes on, then I become miserable, if I spend hours online instead of working or being productive. 

But for now, this is what I allow myself to do, being gentle with myself and negotiating with the ""chill and rest"" part and ""productive"" part. It's still hard. I still have a very strict ambitions part that makes me miserable no matter what I do in the day. 

I'll try to eventually add things like journaling, meditation, and other ""productive"" things but for now I really appreciate this part. It's trying to soothe me and make me happy. ",5,1728653032.0,InternalFamilySystems,1,1.0,False

Price Movement Recap

Yesterday started the short term reversal I’ve talked about materializing at the end of this week. After a brief shot down at open, traders played with the gamma dynamics built into the options structure to run us up to $21 several times and eventually closed at $20.91 to show our first Green Day in eight trading days. Options volume was decidedly bullish and we had slight uptick in total volume overall.

OI Changes + Max Pain

Our total volume still wasn’t enough to shift our max pain expectations for Friday, which still sits at $21.

10/11 OI shows a sizable increase in calls OI up through $22 from traders taking bets on continued price action today up to test $22, while out holders simultaneously cashed out of their positions in sizable numbers at those same strikes.

10/18 OI, notably, did show some expansion in call OI but also some mild expansion in Put OI. Sentimentally, this reflects broader trader sentiment that next week the stock is probably not going to start running away to the upside just yet.

If the $22 test should materialize today, this will likely suggest early bullishness near open Monday, followed by a potential retrace back into the trading range we saw this week. This would have the effect of “bull trapping” short-term long call buyers hungry to profit off trend continuation into buying and holding OTM calls into a worthless expiry.

NFA, but we are probably NOT looking at immediate or rapid lift off beyond $22 so DONT GET FLEECED ON SHORT TERM LONG CALLS. They are DESIGNED to the favor the DEALERS, in other words NOT retail traders!

Gamma Exposure

As we can see our negative net gamma exposure across all strikes has notably retreated as a result of yesterday’s price action, as Wednesday’s price action signaled that major continued downside volatility was tapped out. We have sizable net positive gamma exposure levels all throughout our $20-$22 range, which suggest slow, stable, grindy upward seesawing into the top of that range and back. 5mil in volume would suggest about a $.60-.70 total move on the day that ultimately ends up somewhere close, but perhaps slightly above Max Pain. Obviously if an institution comes in and decides they want to make a Friday splash and stir up the IV pot, about double the total volume would see us excitingly head up to that $22 level. The resulting IV appreciation to calls may actually work to Dealer advantage as it will incentivize call volume today into October OPEX (and transfer a higher premium volume into their coffers).

Technicals

Our stabilization and reversal suggests that, indeed, barring any major ‘panic’ manipulation excuses like Nikkeimaggeddon in August, RC’s September ATM has indeed driven up GME’s floor by $1 as I hypothesized two weeks ago from the transposition of the upper end of our trading bracket to exactly $1 above the 50-day SMA value.

What this also indicates is that, since our May Sneeze 2.0, GME has had a series of gradually increasing higher lows at the rate of about $1 per company fundamental action/event. After ATM #1 in May, GME established a bottom of around $17.50. After ATM #2, this bottom was revisited only in the inaccessible premarket after the Nikkei crash, but intraday logged a minimum value above $18.50. After GME Q2 Earnings, the stock only penetrated as far down as $19.31 with no close below $19.50 during that selling period. Now, post September ATM, GME reversed off an intraday low of $20.30 with no close below $20.50. Each event has indeed steadily crept the floor higher as was theorized way back when the RC ATM strategy was theorized and described back during Sneeze 2.0 (and by RK himself during the original livestreams).

With our key moving averages still converging, they project to meet in late October, early November around $20-$20.50, our current floor. When this occurs, GME’s technical paradigm will be technically, fundamentally, and historically underpinned at $20-$20.50 and completely open to the upside with only the options market to constrain it. With National Cat Day coming up smack dab in the middle of that technical convergence, I have a hard time projecting anything except a blue sky green run into the holiday season as potential big bulls see the signal and set themselves up.

Implied Volatility

Given our low volume yesterday, IV levels remained overall somewhat static and logged an 81.4% value on the close. Intraday, we did see some IV spikes correspond to our Bull runs. If something similar (as described above) can materialize, IV will tick up a few percentage points short-term, near the money call options will disproportionately appreciate. While there are opportunities to profit from this, most of them will likely be exploited by options dealers looking to squeeze more premium out of the market into October OPEX.

Synthesis + TA;DR

Our short term reversal has begun and it looks set up to continue into today with a possible test of $22, especially if some larger players should throw a bit of money around to force IV to appreciate a bit more dynamically. This, however, does not mean that such a test will hold the $22 price level or continue upwardly into next week. In fact, it is more likely that this upward volatility will be used by dealers to squeeze more profit out of retail traders on what will probably be a relatively flat week next week into OPEX. I could always be wrong here - always - but I see what I have described as the most likely scenario unfolding over the next 6 trading days (somewhat amazingly as concurs with the doodle archetype I scribbled back before September OPEX).

Good luck out there!

Cheers

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open! ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty. Open Interest (this post) is not trade advice. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.",50,1728652927.0,Superstonk,5,0.91,False

""So cap'n, this is probably gonna be a long one,"" Commander Henskin said casually. ""Think we're in for the suck?""

A few eyebrows rose on the other officers as I looked at the former marine with the sort of deep apathy that can only be obtained by a severe lack of caffeination. Commander Henskin had taken advantage of a program that allows enlisted to become officers when they switch branches. Every now and then, he forgets that officers are supposed to speak a certain way, which can be a problem since he's my second-in-command.

""Posture and poise, Henskin,"" I reminded him. ""But... When are we not?""

""Right, sorry sir. And when you're right, you're right,"" he chuckled.

""Think it's gonna be worse than other missions, sir?"" Lieutenant Commander Yorvi asked.

The alumari navigator absentmindedly cleaned her carapace, betraying her nervousness. Actually, come to think of it, is an alumari exoskeleton considered a carapace? I'll have to look that up later.

""Well, this mission's going to be taking us into uncharted territory,"" I said as casually as possible. ""Literally. The thing about uncharted territory is that it is full of possibilities. So, this COULD be the best mission we'll ever go on.""

""Or the worst?""

""Correct.""

""I-I see.""

""Don't worry about it, Yorvi,"" Henskin intervened. ""All we've got to do is try our best.""

""Which is what we do by default, no?"" I asked with a chuckle before looking around the room. ""Where'd they put the coffee pot on this tug?""

""In the mess, sir,"" Lieutenant Bon answered.

I looked at the gont weapon's expert with a betrayed expression.

""Why's it in the mess?""

""That's where coffee goes, sir.""

""Negative, lieutenant. Coffee goes in my cup and my cup goes with me.""

""Well, I'm afraid this vessel does not come equipped with wait-staff, sir.""

""I beg to differ. Ensign Likjo, a coffee please,"" I grinned at the urakari maintenance lead.

""Yes, sir. Any additives?"" he asked.

""Two cubes of sugar and one cube of vanilla creamer. Thank you.""

Likjo nodded, seemingly happy to be given the task, and hastily left the bridge. I'll admit that I had my doubts when I was told that there would be members of the Republic along for the ride, but the ones I've met seem amicable. Wasn't happy about the surprise meeting with the spider people, though. Damn glad I've got experience with the alumari, or I'd have shit myself.

""This ship's weird,"" Henskin muttered.

""What do you mean?"" Bon asked.

""Everything about it is classified, right?""

""Pretty much,"" I replied.

""Then why are the aliens from the Republic on board? No offense, guys.""

Some of the sensor techs were from various Republic species, and waved passively to indicate that no offense was taken.

""Well aren't we allied with the Republic? Why wouldn't they be here?"" Bon asked.

""Well, we're also allied with some other aliens, right? They're not here,"" Henskin countered.

""I can't say that I know the exact reasons behind it, but I'm able to mentally make it make sense,"" I said. ""The Republic is the closest thing we have to a near-peer in the whole galaxy thus far. As such, the US needs to know if it can trust the Republic. A spy-ship is a perfect way to determine whether that trust can exist. If the Republic has a ship like this in a few years, we know for certain they can't be trusted.""

""Why's a spy-ship perfect?"" Henskin asked with a confused expression. ""We don't want them to have this kind of tech, do we?""

""A spy-ship's design is pretty signature. If you change too much of what you're copying from, it's not going to work right,"" I replied, rubbing my temples. ""So if the Republic releases a new ship based on this design, it's going to be obvious where their inspiration came from. Plus, this ship doesn't have much in the way of weapons, armor, or shields. So even if they copy it bow to stern and deck to keel, they aren't going to see many improvements over their current versions of those technologies.""

""If it helps dissuade your concerns, there was a loyalty test when we were chosen for this assignment,"" an isolan sensor tech added. ""Shortly after we received our orders, we were approached by shady individuals offering tons of money to spy on you and steal technical schematics. Turns out, those guys were working for the government and were weeding out undesirables.""

The other Republic sensor technicians nodded in agreement.

""That sounds like something Omega would pull,"" I chuckled.

""I didn't have to,"" the AI said from my seat's speaker. ""The Republic thought of it all on their own. Fun fact, less than two percent of their chosen candidates failed that test. The last time we did something like that, about fifteen percent failed.""

""So... We're less trustworthy than they are?"" Henskin asked.

""Not really. While the data may seem to suggest that, it isn't particularly comprehensive. For instance, I don't know how much each individual was offered, which species they were, or even how financially stable they were. All of these variables would likely impact an individuals likeliness to betray confidence, yet these variables weren't accounted for with either test,"" Omega said. ""So all we can say for certain is that more members of the US military were untrustworthy for that particular test.""

""Yeah, very interesting,"" I said, stifling a yawn. ""Are we ready to go?""

""Not yet, but soon. Keep an eye on your terminal.""

With an absentminded nod, I leaned back in my chair.

""So are all of you ensigns?"" Henskin asked the isolan sensor tech.

""No, I'm a lieutenant,"" he chuckled. ""That's higher than ensign, right? I'm not used to your ranking system, yet.""

In the interest of easing confusion, the brass got together and assigned all of the Republic crew US ranks. Instead of easing confusion, though, it just seemed to push it onto their side of the aisle. I watched passively as Henskin and the isolan chatted about ranks for a while, but perked up when a familiar, warm, and absolutely lovely smell caught my nose.

""Here's your coffee, sir,"" Likjo said, giving me the precious plastic goblet.

""Thanks,"" I said and immediately sipped the elixir.

A rush of warmth slid down my throat and my brain almost immediately woke up. I nodded at Likjo, who returned to his station. After another few gulps of coffee, I felt reinvigorated. To say I'm addicted to caffeine is an understatement. If it weren't for my need to sleep, I would be caffeinated at all hours. I find it hard to think without it.

Of course, this addiction wasn't a new thing. It's been carefully cultivated over a long and arduous career as a scout. I've had to replace many nights of sleep with coffee to get my job done.

""You know, sir, they've got energy drinks that you can stow in your chair-fridge,"" Henskin pointed out.

""Not as good as coffee,"" I shook my head dismissively. ""If I drank energy drinks I'd overdo it. Being over-caffeinated is just as bad as being under-caffeinated, maybe even worse. The trick is to find a perfect balance and maintain it. Plus, I like my drinks warm and energy drinks taste disgusting when they're not cold.""

""Well, they aren't going to let you bring the coffee pot in here.""

""Don't need them to let me. I'm a stealth specialist,"" I grinned.

My antics were rewarded with a few chuckles from the bridge crew.

""So, have you all served together before?"" Ensign Likjo asked.

""Yes,"" I replied. ""Henskin's been my second-in-command for a couple years now, and Yorvi joined us about... What, six months ago?""

""Eight months, sir"" Yorvi corrected me.

""I'm the new one,"" Bon added. ""I'd barely got my stuff aboard the USSS Defiant before they reassigned us. And unlike our last ship, this one has barely any weaponry. I suspect I'm going to be scratching my haunches for most of the mission.""

""You would be anyway,"" Henskin laughed. ""The whole point of a scout is to avoid contact with the enemy while observing them. On most ships your job is integral, but on scout ships you're a 'just in case' measure.""

""Yeah,"" the gont sighed.

""Most US ships that I've seen can take one hell of a beating, and dish it out, too. But you said this one has less shields and such?"" the isolan sensor tech from earlier asked.

""Yes,"" I answered. ""You'll find that the United Systems has an 'all in' mentality when it comes to our ships. As such, since this ship is for scouting, it isn't equipped for a fight. It was designed with keeping a low profile in mind, and so it has the bare minimum when it comes to armor, shields, and weapons. Just enough to give us time to run if we're spotted.""

""Needless to say, we'll be trying to avoid any action,"" Henskin said.

My terminal beeped with a notification, and everyone turned to look at me as I opened it. Launch orders. I forwarded the destination to Lt. Commander Yorvi.

""Alright, looks like it's time to go. Prepare the FTLD and the buoys. When you're ready,"" I nodded at the alumari.

""Yes, sir,"" she said. ""Fleet-com synchronized. Jumping in three... two... one...""

1g19gl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebrityweightlose/comments/1g19gl9/a_second_wind_how_jack_rediscovered_life_with/,A Second Wind: How Jack Rediscovered Life with AlphaBites,"It was the kind of cold, crisp morning that reminded Jack Donovan of his youth. He stood on his porch, coffee steaming in his hand, watching the sun rise over the hills of his quiet Ohio town. At 45, Jack was proud of his life—two kids in college, a successful small business, and a loving wife, Sarah, by his side for over 20 years. But beneath the surface of his picturesque life, Jack felt a little off.

He hadn’t noticed it at first. Like so many others, the changes had crept in slowly. He found himself getting tired earlier in the day, barely making it through a workday without feeling completely drained. His usual zest for life was missing. Even his evenings with Sarah had become routine—comfortable, but lacking the spark that had once defined their relationship.

One Friday evening, while sitting around a fire with his close friend, Mike, Jack opened up. “I don’t know, man,” Jack said, staring into the flames. “I just don’t feel like myself anymore. The energy’s not there, and even with Sarah, it’s like… we’re good, but something’s missing.”

Mike gave a knowing nod. “I’ve been there. Same thing happened to me last year. But I found something that’s been a game-changer—Alphabites Male Enhancement Gummies.”

Jack raised an eyebrow. “Gummies? For real?” It sounded like some late-night TV ad gimmick.

Mike chuckled. “I thought the same thing. But I tried them, and it wasn’t just about the obvious stuff. They gave me back my energy, my focus. I feel like I’m 10 years younger, man. It’s not just about sex; it’s about getting your drive back in every part of life.”

Jack was skeptical, but he trusted Mike. The next day, he ordered a bottle of Alphabites, figuring it couldn’t hurt to try.

[Alphabites](https://preview.redd.it/pty17m6vu2ud1.png?width=470&format=png&auto=webp&s=2db3a65eee38a95b6e832268d8d47c3b16550a17)

**The Change**

At first, Jack didn’t notice much. But by the end of the first week, something had shifted. He wasn’t hitting that afternoon slump as hard anymore. His mind felt clearer, and at night, he didn’t just collapse into bed—he had energy left for Sarah, and their relationship began to feel more like it had in their early years together.

It wasn’t just the physical changes, either. Jack felt more confident. The self-assuredness that had once been second nature to him was returning, and it felt good. For the first time in years, he was genuinely looking forward to each day, rather than just getting through it.

His curiosity piqued, Jack dove deeper into what made Alphabites work. Packed with natural ingredients like Tongkat Ali and Horny Goat Weed, the gummies were designed to boost testosterone, improve stamina, and increase blood flow. But it wasn’t just about physical performance. These ingredients also helped with mental clarity and reducing stress—things Jack didn’t even realize had been weighing him down.

**A Newfound Confidence**

At work, Jack’s coworkers noticed the change, too. “You’ve been on fire lately,” one of his employees remarked after a particularly busy day. Jack grinned, knowing that his secret wasn’t just about some miracle cure—it was a combination of Alphabites, healthier choices, and a renewed sense of purpose.

One afternoon, as he and Sarah prepared for their upcoming anniversary getaway, Sarah noticed the difference as well. “You’ve been different lately,” she said with a smile. “I like it.”

Jack smiled back, feeling more alive and connected to her than he had in years. He wasn’t just coasting through life anymore—he was living it.

**Paying It Forward**

Feeling revitalized, Jack found himself talking to more friends about his experience. On one of his regular scrolls through Reddit, he stumbled upon a forum where men like him were sharing their struggles with aging, energy, and intimacy. He started contributing, telling his own story in the hopes of helping others.

It was there he met Robert, a truck driver from Texas, who had been in a similar situation. “I was ready to give up,” Robert wrote. “After my divorce, I just didn’t feel like myself. But Alphabites helped me feel alive again. It’s not just about sex—it’s about feeling good in your own skin.”

Jack related to that. He’d seen firsthand how these little gummies had done more than just restore his energy—they’d helped him rediscover his confidence and his connection to Sarah.

**Looking Ahead**

Months later, Jack stood on the same porch, watching the sun dip below the horizon. He felt like he had his life back—no, more than that. He felt like he was better than ever.

For any guy out there feeling like life is slowing down, Jack’s advice was simple: “Sometimes, it’s the smallest change—a conversation, a gummy—that can make the biggest difference. You don’t have to settle for feeling less than your best.”

**And for Jack, Alphabites wasn’t just a supplement—it was the start of a new chapter in his life, one that was filled with energy, confidence, and a renewed sense of purpose.** [**https://alphabites.com/**](https://freezegluco.com/AlphaBites.html)",1,1728652329.0,celebrityweightlose,0,1.0,False

It was probably THE most scared I had ever been during a hurricane. I wasn't afraid of dying or anything, more so that things would just get... *complicated.*

Sometime before we all went to bed, the power went out. I'm glad we had our phones with tus and that our phones have in-built flashlights... I can't help but think of what would have happened if this had occurred when we were kids and none of us had of those smart devices (not because it was ""back in the day"", we just had those kinds of parents). It's been more than a whole day now, and the power still hasn't come back on. I spent most of yesterday either sweating or burning fallen tree parts. I went for a walk to see what stores were open and it looks like it's just Big Ones -- the franchises, Walmart and McD's and all that, and even then, the restaurants are just barely staffed enough to keep the drive-thru running. They should be open today, which means I can go mooch off their open outlets to charge my phone back up.

I will say, we've gotten pretty inventive over the past couple of days. I found a Christmas lights headband from a couple Christmases ago and it works pretty well as a way to see in the dark without needing to hold my phone up to everything. We used the outdoor grill to cook some water for coffee. My dad phoned a friend willing to let us charge up and eat Wendy's at their place (we watched the last half of Alita: Battle Angel, which was pretty sweet). And ironically, my room hasn't looked this clean in ages!

I wanna say things will go back to normal. For most people, I'm sure they will. But things have already been pretty different at my house -- my mom moved out, my dad is selling the house, everything is being packed into boxes and piled up, and now my dad's kinda pissed that my mom hasn't taken us to her house (which has electricity) or anything. For the first time in my adult life, we're moving. *I'm* moving. And that scares me almost as much as the hurricane. It's a big change in every direction.

My DH38 and HCBM decided they wanted SS to go to school in the district where we live but I'm the one who has to take care of him all the time. HCBM lives 3 hours away and DH is a truck driver so he is gone all week until the weekend. So I'm the one stuck with SS. I also have a 7 month old baby at home and working full time. SS makes messes all over the house and won't clean them up unless he is told too. I'm sooooo sick and tired of having to tell him to clean up after himself or brush his teeth or take a shower. My anxiety is through the roof. I've tried to talk to DH about him not being here and SS basically being dumped all on me. He says there's nothing he can do because he can't find a better paying job. And then he proceeds to yell at SS over the phone saying stop bugging your SM , which makes me look and feel like an A-hole, and it becomes this overwhelming and exhausting emotional cycle. This morning has been the last straw. I went to open the fridge and a full bottle of coffee creamer flew out onto the floor. This is because SS put the coffee creamer on the edge of the shelf in order to put a piece of cake away he didn't finish yesterday. It's like he doesn't know basic shapes or common sense, like the creamer is going to fall out if you leave it like that, like can't you see if someone opens the fridge it going to fall out. Wtf! I'm just pissed off and don't want to deal with him anymore. DH told me yesterday that he has to work on Saturday and I asked DH if SS was going to go to his mom's this weekend and he said no because she is moving, so guess who get stuck with SS once again, me!

1g19b98,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1g19b98/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

**1. safely traveling with scales**: *does anyone have experience / recommendations for how to keep your coffee scale safe when traveling?*

i have a timemore mini scale, about six months old, and its weight meter has become increasingly unreliable with constant fluctuations — i've taken it with me on trips and tried my best to keep it safe (turning the scale off, wrapping it up in my backpack so it is fixed in place). i likely need to get a new scale (i had the acaia in mind) but am scared that if i bring it with me anywhere, i'll risk breaking it. wondering if the acaia case is sufficient...

**2.** **nonplastic drippers / travel safety:** *what are your favorite nonplastic drippers (excluding the switch), and what do you use to keep them safe in your bag when traveling?*

this beloved reddit has made me increasingly worried about using my plastic brewers (orea v3, cafec flower, aeropress) every day and i'm looking into a nonplastic dripper to use as my new go-to replacement (i really love my orea flat bottom so i've been looking at orea's glass + ceramic models, i have the hario switch but i feel it's *too* big to put in my backpack and might sell it or gift it to a friend). curious to hear about peoples' favorite nonplastic drippers, and any case solutions for them :) tyvm!!!",3,1728651887.0,pourover,16,1.0,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

A month or so after getting back together, after he was on a night out, I saw a text on his phone from an unknown girl saying that they should get a coffee. When I confronted him, he said that she was struggling with her mental health and he wanted to help her. I told him I don’t believe that and he needs to not contact her again. 

A few months later, on a night out, he says that after coming back from the bathroom he was me flirting and almost kissing another man. This is something that he claims had also happened previously. I however have no recollection of either (I have changed my relationship with alcohol since this). 

Months after these incidents we moved in together. He has been distant recently and after speaking with him, he says that my instances of almost indefinitely have now dawned on him and he is unsure if he can work past it. He is hoping to attend counselling to work through this however he doesn’t believe it will work. 

I hope that he will also agree to going to therapy together but when I have suggested this previously he has refused. I just feel so lost, our last breakup almost killed me and I know that is my fault, but I don’t know how I can go through this again. Up until a couple of months ago we were talking about marriage and kids and now I think he’s going to walk away again.

Hey everyone! So, I stumbled upon this wild idea: if 70% of men aren’t getting swipes on Tinder, does that mean they’re forever alone? 

I mean, think about it. In a world where swiping right is basically the norm, it’s easy to feel like if you’re not matching, you’re just destined for a life of solitude. But is that really true? 

And let’s not forget about how people used to meet family gatherings, school dances, or just running into someone at a coffee shop. Now it feels like we’re all just scrolling through profiles like it’s a game show. 

What do you all think? Is Tinder the ultimate judge of our love lives, or is there more to it? Are we missing out on connections because we’re glued to our screens?

My main reasons for getting on carnivore was to reduce inflammation and to drop some weight. I was hesitant on going full in because I don’t want to lose my ability to process different foods. I was also a big wine drinker and the idea of no wine from now on really didn’t appeal to me.  

My starting stats were 6’1” 242lbs and joint pain all the time. I’m 58 years old and fairly active. Not big on exercise but I also don’t spend a lot of my free time sitting down. Let’s just say I’m a big DIYer.  I do have a torn rotator cuff, and recently tore my meniscus in my right knee. Hence the reason I thought it was time to lose some weight. I will also add that I’m most definitely a foodie and love to cook (and eat). My wife and I also regularly host get-togethers with anywhere from 6 to 15ish people. 95% of which are also foodies and wine drinkers.

I’m about 30 days in and thought I would share my experience so far.

My average day is carnivore with a diet of meat (beef with some pork and chicken) butter, bacon and eggs. If I get the munchies at night I’ll do green beans with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Snack cravings are the hardest part for me. I really don’t want to get into cooking bacon come night time so the green beans seams like a decent compromise for me. I pretty much only drink a cup of black coffee in the morning and then water with electrolytes thought the day, or some Pellegrino at night when I have a craving for wine. It does help and kinda pushes the wine button for me.

Now the light part. Friday night is wine night and the wife and I share a bottle of wine. I have noticed that my glass lasts a lot longer now that I’m not drinking daily. If I go to a get together I will eat what is served with trying to stay mostly carnivore but will taste other things as well. I also made hamburgers last night and ate it on a potato roll. First bread I’ve had and have to admit, I’ve really missed it.

I do have cravings now that I didn’t have before like wanting ice cream late at night. I wasn’t ever a big sweats guy but I guess cutting sugars out completely has had its effect.

As for the results, I’m definitely sleeping better. I’ve dropped 25 pounds. I test for ketones and have only dropped out to ketosis a couple of times and even then by the following afternoon, I’m back in it.  My ketone count tends to be on the high side so think my body goes into it easier than most.

I’ve read here that a lot of people tend to fall off the wagon or have a real hard time after a cheat day. I haven’t experienced that and I don’t know if it is because I “cheat” more often than most or I’m just lucky. I don’t really notice a difference following them. I will say I have never reached the I’m never hungry and don’t think about food stage that people talk about. I plan on keep going as I am for the long term and try and make it a way of life and not just a diet. Fingers crossed.

Anyway, we are all different and everyone has to do what works for them. I wish you all success in your journey.

I am so disappointed that the guy I had a crush on and thought it was reciprocated…has a girlfriend. He mentioned it casually while we were getting coffee a few days ago. I don’t understand how he was being so available for the last 2 weeks while at the same time already being taken. We had a work trip with everyone in the office. We had game nights with a bunch of colleagues (we are all co-workers) every night for a week. He caught my eyes from a distance and would always approach. Every single night he was either next to me, or in my vicinity…and we would spend the whole night laughing and looking at each other making eyes even though everyone else was also in the room. Every single activity we did, he was somehow nearby chatting or standing next to me. I caught him checking me out a few times. He was teasing me in front of the group, granted he apologized for it a little bit later. He gave me more attention than all the other girls on the trip. I thought he was so obviously into me. 

I commented on it with a good friend (she’s another co-worker), asked her if she noticed something weird going on with him…she asked why, did you notice something? Then she said it was weird that sometimes he would ditch his friends and come sit with us, but maybe that/you were the reason.

I had a feeling that this was too good to be true, my life is never that perfect. Nothing aligns this well for me, ever. My crush liking me back? That could never happen. I mean, I am reasonably attractive, not ugly, but this easy? Never. I have been through this before, a hundred times or more. But this disheartening because it was the first time since my last breakup that I imagined myself willing to date someone new. But now it feels like trying to talk myself out of my shell and into being vulnerable again was a mistake. All for nothing. Perhaps I am a pathetic loser, perhaps I don’t deserve that have the people I like, like me back. Maybe he is really out of my league.

Good morning all, I have seen a couple threads regarding the Nespresso Vertuoline units putting out watery coffee, but none had a real fix and they were all archived, so I figured I would post a new thread with my findings. My issue started about a month after installing a new bearing in my original 2014 unit. The Nespresso was spitting out mostly water, and descaling did not fix it. 

  
The other posts mentioned that you should inspect for leaks, but I had none. Eventually though, my unit started dripping about a 1/2 teaspoon of water from the inside of the top housing. I thought I would try a new bearing also, and after tearing it apart again to install the new bearing, what I found was a fair amount of condensation on the inside of the top panel. 

  
**There is a hollow metal pin that sits in the center of the rotating assembly, and the hot water line has a molded cap that sits on this. They are supposed to be sealed together and this pin should be stationary, not spinning with the rotating assembly**, but when I first reassembled it I set the pin in first, and then the water line cap on that. This did not make a tight seal, and its likely this pin *was* spinning with the rotating assembly. letting water pass on the outside of it instead of through it to the pod. My evidence for this was water and sediment buildup on the outside of the pin.

**During reassembly, I wiped this hollow pin clean, and pressed it into the molded water line head, then pressed molded head into the rotating assembly** before installing the cap with 4 screws. Ever since, it appears the seal between the pin and the molded head has been solid enough that water is now directed through the pin to the pod as it should be, instead of around that pin. Every cup I have brewed since has been spectacular.

It’s all about association. Just like how Pavlov trained dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell, your mind has been conditioned to link certain activities—like drinking coffee or taking a break—with smoking.

But here’s something fascinating: your body doesn’t actually crave the cigarette itself. It craves the ritual you've paired with it. Smokers can fly on long flights without lighting up, go through the night without waking up for a cigarette, yet the moment they sit down with a coffee or a drink, the urge kicks in.

That’s the power of habit.

The good news? Habits can be broken.

What if you could enjoy your morning coffee without the automatic pull of a cigarette? It might feel strange at first, but it’s not physical withdrawal—it’s simply your brain adjusting to a new, healthier association. And with time, it becomes second nature to sip that coffee, stress-free, smoke-free.

And when you understand this shift, it’s the first step towards breaking free from those automatic, unnecessary urges.",13,1728650076.0,stopsmoking,4,1.0,False

There are the beans the app suggests, but they’re kind of pricey compared to what I can get at the supermarket.

Does the recognition feature actually make a noticeable difference? Does it really adjust the grind, temperature, or anything else based on the beans, or is it more of a gimmick?

","Yo, fellow grinders! So, I've been burning the candle at both ends lately - you know, hustling at work, hitting the gym, trying to start a side gig, the whole nine yards. Saw this Alpha Grind stuff pop up on my Insta feed and thought, ""Hey, if it can give me an edge, why not?"" Here's my no-BS take after a month of being on this supposed ""god tier"" supplement:

**The Gains:**

1. Energy kick: Not gonna lie, this stuff gives you a serious boost. It's like my morning coffee and pre-workout had a baby, but without the jitters. Productivity? Through the roof.
2. Focus game strong: Used to zone out during long meetings, now I'm the guy asking questions at the end. My boss probably thinks I'm gunning for his job (spoiler: I am).
3. Gym performance: Crushing PR's left and right. Could be the placebo effect, but my lifts have definitely improved.
4. Mood elevation: Feel like I can take on the world. Confidence is up, stress seems more manageable.

**The Pains:**

1. RIP wallet: This stuff ain't cheap. Seriously considering selling a kidney to fund my Alpha Grind habit.
2. Sleep? What's that?: If I take it too late in the day, goodbye sweet dreams. Learned that lesson the hard way.
3. Tolerance build-up: Effects seemed to plateau after a couple weeks. Had to cycle off for a few days to get the magic back.
4. Dry mouth: Constantly feeling like I just ate a mouthful of sand. Started carrying a water bottle everywhere.

**Random Thoughts:**

* The crash isn't as bad as with some other supplements I've tried, but it's there. Plan accordingly.
* Appetite suppression is real. Great for cutting, not so great when you're trying to bulk.
* Had a weird tingly sensation in my fingers for the first few days. Went away, but kinda freaky.
* My girlfriend says I talk faster now. Not sure if that's a compliment or a complaint.

**Bottom Line:** Is Alpha Grind the key to unlocking your inner beast mode? Maybe. It definitely gives you a kick in the pants, but it's not some magic pill that'll do the work for you. I'd rate it a solid 8/10. Effective, but expensive and not without its quirks.

I'm probably gonna keep using it, but I'm also gonna start looking for ways to replicate this state naturally. Meditation, better sleep, cleaner diet - you know, all the boring stuff we should be doing anyway.

Anyone else riding the Alpha Grind train? Or got any other supplements that turned you into a productivity machine? Drop your experiences below!

P.S. If this review seems a bit intense, blame it on the Alpha Grind. I wrote this in like 10 minutes flat while planning world domination and meal prepping for the week.",1,1728650025.0,EffectiveNootropics,0,1.0,False
1g18o8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1g18o8m/the_silent_one_part_1/,The Silent One [Part 1],"Another work week had come to an end. Antony Collins closed his folder with documents of his very recent case and put it back on the shelf with all the rest. With a single press on the off button, he quickly turned his work computer off. And finally, lights off, and locking of his office meant a beginning of the weekend. Antony loved the Fridays.

He rode his car through the streets enlightened with bright street lights under the already dark night sky. The people were out to have a great time at some bar or to have a nice dinner at some restaurant, or to just walk around.

Even the best lawyers in town deserve some great time out, he said to himself while entering the parking lot of the Ragussa Pub.

Inside, the atmosphere was electric with anticipation and the release of a long week’s tension. It was warm and lively, with a sense of camaraderie and shared relief that ripples through the room. It was dimly lit with dark wood beams, exposed brick walls, and a long, polished bar lined with stools. Tables were scattered across the scuffed floor, and a cozy, timeworn atmosphere filled the snug, intimate space.

Now he was looking for his table, and there it was. At the corner, by the big window that was opening towards a wonderful sight to the harbor. His group’s favorite place.

“Hey, lil’ hustler!” Jim greeted him, raising his pint.

“Joke’s on you, I’m getting paid overtime,” Anthony grinned, taking a sip of his beer.

“Overtime? For what? Filing complaints about our coffee machine?” Sarah teased.

“Nah, for making sure you guys don’t get sued after nights like this.” Anthony winked.

“Cheers to our future defense attorney!” Jim laughed, clinking glasses.

The night went the best it could. The three lawyers needed that beer and relief after their exhausting working week.

Anthony was now driving slowly and carefully looking for police patrolling somewhere. Even being among the best lawyers in the town with the experience and skills that he had, he couldn’t defend himself from getting his driving lisence taken for drunk driving. Still he felt sober enough to drive back home.

The neighborhood was quiet. Only the soft rustling of leaves could be heard under the gentle breeze, and his footsteps crunching through the fallen leaves seemed the loudest sound in the stillness. But then, everything stopped. The wind died down abruptly, leaving an eerie silence hanging in the air. Anthony paused, his senses on edge. The only sound now was his own racing heartbeat. Something felt off.

“Maybe four pints was one too many,” he muttered to himself, trying to shake off the unease. With a nervous chuckle, he headed inside for some much-needed sleep.

Sunday was a fishing day, and a day to drive the Chevy truck. Anthony drove past Jim’s house, the truck bed loaded with gear, and together they headed to the small pond just outside town. The air was crisp, with the scent of pine and damp soil, and the trees surrounding the water were ablaze with autumn colors: fiery reds, vibrant oranges, and golden yellows reflected in the still surface of the pond. The sulence was only broken by the occasional rustle of leaves and the soft plop of a fish jumping.

Anthony cast his line, watching the bobber float peacefully. “You know, Jim,” he said, “sometimes I think about quitting the law and just doing this for a living.”
Jim snorted. “Fishing?”

“Yeah,” Anthony grinned. “Think about it. No deadlines, no paperwork. Just us, the fish, and that one beaver over there that probably hates us.”

Jim laughed, casting his own line. “Sure, but you’d miss the thrill of defending people who can’t tell a lie from a laminated document.”

“True,” Anthony admitted. “But at least out here, the only thing trying to bite me is the fish.”

“Don’t forget the mosquitoes,” Jim added, swatting at his arm. “I’m pretty sure they’re on retainer.”

Anthony chuckled. “Guess they don’t know I’m billing them for overtime, too.”

But Jim didn’t respond. He kept silent instead. The occassional buzz of the mosquitoes vanished. The jumping of the fish stopped. No sound could be heard for a moment. Anthony looked around. The silence seemed so unnatural and so oppressive, as if it was pressing down on his chest, making his breathing heavy and his heartbeat stong enough so he would feel it in his ears.

But it went away, all of a sudden. Anthony could swear that he saw a silhouette between the trees on the oposite side of the pond, but Jim seemed that he didn’t notice anything. And as Anthony turned his head back to the water, something pulled his bait down in the pond. He pulled it back firmly, and there it was, a catfish almost a meter long, pulling against the fishing reel.

Jim jumped out of excitement.

“Well done, lil’ hustler!”, Jim yelled, while grabbing the big hook on a long, wooden handle to help Anthony pull the fish out of the water.

They were happy to catch a great dinner. In the evening that followed, Jim was in Anthony’s kitchen helping him with the cooking.

As they sat down to dinner, Anthony served the golden-brown catfish alongside crispy hushpuppies and a fresh salad.

“Here’s to a successful catch and a great dinner!” Anthony raised his glass, and Jim joined in, clinking his drink against Anthony’s.

“Cheers to our fishing skills! May our next catch be even bigger,” Jim added with a grin, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

They dug into the meal, the tender catfish was flaky and flavorful. Between bites, they talked about the day’s adventures, recounting how Jim had almost lost his balance while trying to help pull the fish with the hook.

“I swear I saw you about to take a dip!” Anthony laughed, wiping his mouth. “Next time, I’ll tie you to a tree.”

“Only if you promise to jump in after me if I go overboard!” Jim shot back, chuckling. 
“Deal!” Anthony replied, raising his glass again.

As they continued to eat, the conversation flowed effortlessly, filled with inside jokes and teasing. The warmth of friendship enveloped them, making the simple meal feel like a feast.

“Man, if every Sunday was like this, I’d never want to go back to work,” Jim said, leaning back contentedly in his chair.

“Agreed,” Anthony said, smiling. “Just us, the fish, and no emails.” 

The laughter and joy lingered long into the evening, leaving behind memories of a perfect day spent together. But one thing was was unclear to Anthony. Was he losing his mind?

Monday arrived, and Anthony was back in his office like every other workday. The low hum of the fluorescent lights provided a familiar, almost comforting presence, buzzing softly in every corner of the building. He was buried in a complex case, papers strewn across his desk as he tried to make sense of the overwhelming evidence. The mental strain finally caught up with him, and a sudden, pounding headache hit him hard. Standing up too quickly, he felt dizzy and nauseous.

The walk to the bathroom felt endless as his steps wobbled unsteadily. Just as he reached the door of his office, everything went silent, abruptly, unnaturally. That same uneasy feeling crept up his spine, like he was being watched. His heart skipped as he saw it again, a silhouette, standing motionless in front of the bathroom door at the end of the hall. 

He blinked, rubbing his eyes, and it vanished. The strange feeling lifted with it, the nausea fading. The hum of the lights returned, and the world felt normal again. But Anthony couldn’t shake the lingering chill that remained.

“Hey, buddy,” Jim called out from his office, peeking from behind the door. “You all right?”

Anthony leaned against the wall, still trying to catch his breath. “Yeah, man. I’m good,” he replied, his voice sounding exhausted and distant.

Jim stepped closer, his eyes widening as he got a better look at Anthony. “You’re pale like a dead man,” he said, quickly closing the distance between them. “Seriously, what’s up?”

Anthony forced a weak smile and put a hand on Jim’s shoulder. “I’m totally alright,” he said, trying to sound convincing. “Just… overworked. Too many late nights.”

Before Jim could respond, Sarah appeared at the end of the hall. Her eyes flicked nervously between the two of them, taking in Anthony’s pale face and uneasy stance.

“Hey, Anthony,” she said, her voice a little higher than usual. “You okay? You don’t look so good.”

“I’m fine,” Anthony insisted, straightening up and trying to sound more normal. “Just a headache. It’s nothing.”

Sarah hesitated, glancing around the hallway nervously. “Are you sure? You really don’t look well.”

“Yeah, I promise,” Anthony said, forcing another smile. “I just need to get some air, maybe grab a coffee.”

Jim still looked skeptical, but he nodded slowly. “Okay, but don’t push yourself, man. You really look like you need a break.”

Sarah nodded in agreement, her gaze darting around the hall again before she looked back at Anthony. “Yeah, take it easy. It’s just… you seem really out of it today.”

Anthony sighed, feeling the weight of their concern. “I’ll be fine,” he reassured them, though the words felt hollow. He could see the doubt in their eyes, especially Sarah’s, who kept glancing around as if she was searching for something.

“Okay,” she said softly, still watching him carefully. “But if you need anything, just let us know.”

“Thanks, guys,” Anthony said, his voice a little more steady now. “I appreciate it.”

As the days passed, Anthony couldn’t shake the unsettling feeling of being watched. As if the sudden silences weren’t unnerving enough, it was the shadowy silhouette that kept appearing, lingering at the edge of his vision, that truly disturbed him. None of it made any sense, yet the occurrences grew more frequent, each one tightening the grip of anxiety and paranoia around him. Was he losing his mind?

One rainy night, the three of them gathered at their usual pub. The storm outside was relentless, raindrops tapping steadily against the windows as if trying to join the conversation. The warm light inside contrasted sharply with the gloomy weather, casting a cozy glow over the group as they took their drinks.

Anthony took a long sip of his beer and then, after weeks of holding it in, finally spoke up. “I’ve been seeing something,” he began, his voice low but serious. Jim and Sarah looked up from their glasses, curious.

“Seeing what?” Jim asked, raising an eyebrow.

Anthony hesitated, then took a deep breath. “A shadowy figure. It’s been appearing around me, at home, at work. And every time, everything goes completely silent. No sound, nothing. It’s… it’s like the world just stops.”

Jim snorted, shaking his head with a smile. “You’ve been watching too many horror movies, man,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “Come on, you’re telling us you’ve got your own personal ghost now?”

But Sarah’s expression didn’t change. She stayed silent, her eyes locked on Anthony as if trying to gauge how serious he was. “When did this start?” she asked quietly.

“A few weeks ago,” Anthony replied, glancing around nervously. “It’s been happening more often lately. I didn’t want to say anything because it sounds crazy, but I swear it’s real.”

Jim rolled his eyes. “Okay, so let me get this straight. You see a shadow, everything goes quiet, and what? This thing just stands there staring at you?”

“Pretty much,” Anthony said, looking down at his hands. “It’s like it’s watching me, waiting for something.”

“Sounds like a bad dream,” Jim said, dismissing it with a wave. “I bet it’s just stress messing with your head.”

Before Anthony could respond, a heavy silence fell over the pub, so abrupt that it was almost tangible. The usual chatter, the clinking of glasses, even the rain outside, all of it ceased. The three of them froze, eyes widening in unison. Also, all the other patrons stared outside, utterly silent.

Then, through the pub’s large front window, they saw it: a tall, dark figure standing motionless across the street, barely illuminated by the streetlights. Its faceless silhouette seemed to blend into the shadows, an unsettling presence that sent a shiver down Anthony’s spine.

Jim’s face went pale as he stared at the figure. “What the hell is that?” he whispered, his voice barely audible.

Anthony swallowed hard, his throat dry. “That’s what I’ve been talking about,” he said shakily. “That’s it.”

Sarah, who had been watching the figure intently, suddenly looked at Anthony with something like fear in her eyes. “We need to talk,” she said, her voice urgent and trembling. “In private.”

And all of a sudden, all the sounds came back.

“Why? What’s going on?” Jim asked, as much confused as he was scared.

“Now,” she insisted, grabbing Anthony’s arm and pulling him away from the table. They hurried towards a quieter corner of the pub, leaving Jim staring after them, his expression a mixture of confusion and dread.

“What do you know about this?” Anthony demanded as soon as they were alone, his heart pounding.

Sarah glanced over her shoulder, then back at him, her eyes were wide, filled with fear. “It’s called The Silent One,” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the ambient noise of the pub. “It’s not just a ghost or a figment of your imagination. It’s a summoned entity, a kind of dark spirit that obeys the will of whoever calls it.”

“A summoned entity?” Anthony repeated, struggling to comprehend. “How do you summon something like that?”

Sarah looked around again, as if she feared the walls themselves were listening. “There’s a ritual,” she said quietly. “It involves candles, blood, and a specific incantation. The person performing the ritual has to offer their own blood as fail-safe and stay absolutely silent until the job is done. The moment they make a sound, even the faintest whisper, The Silent One turns on them instead.”

“The job?” Anthony was confused. “What do you mean?”

Sarah continued. “A job is given to the entity to kill someone you ask it to. The blood of the victim is offered to it. But if the summoner breaks any rule, mostly the silence rule, The Silent One turns against them.”

Anthony felt his skin crawl. “How do you know all this?”

She hesitated, her eyes distant as if remembering something painful. “Because it happened to me once,” she said, her voice breaking slightly.

Anthony stared at her, stunned. “What? When?”

“A few years ago,” she said, glancing down at her trembling hands. “I defended this guy in court. A real psychopath. He killed eleven people in a mall shooting. I tried to get his sentence reduced, but I failed. He got life in prison.”

She took a deep breath, steadying herself before continuing. “After the trial, I started seeing things, just like you’re describing. The shadow, the silence. I thought I was losing my mind. Then, I got a call from the prison. They told me the man had performed some sort of ritual in his cell, calling it to kill me.”

Anthony’s heart sank. “But you’re still here.”

Sarah nodded, swallowing hard. “He broke the silence rule,” she said, her voice trembling. “He couldn’t keep quiet, even with his life on the line. He couldn’t resist to brag about it to the guards, and that was enough. The Silent One turned on him and… slit his throat with its silver knife. The guards saw it happen. They couldn’t explain it, but they saw it.”

Anthony’s mind was racing. “Is there any way to stop it?”

Sarah shook her head slowly, her eyes filled with despair. “No, Anthony. Once it’s summoned, it won’t stop until it’s done. But there’s one thing you can do to delay it: stay silent. It hunts by sound. If you stay quiet, you can keep it from coming closer. It’ll stay at the distance it’s already at, but it won’t go away. It’s just… delayed.”

Anthony felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead. “So, I just… don’t speak?”

Sarah nodded. “Exactly. But it’s only a temporary solution. It’s still out there, waiting. The silence just holds it off. It can’t make it leave.”

He took a deep breath, feeling trapped. “And the person who summoned it? They have to stay silent too?”

“Yes,” Sarah said. “One sound, and it turns on them. That’s how it works. The question is…” she looked at him, her expression dark with fear, “who would go through all of that to summon it for you, Anthony? Who wants you dead so badly that they’d risk their own life?”",1,1728649915.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

","Hey brain-boosters of Reddit! So, I've been feeling like my mind's been stuck in second gear lately - you know, forgetting where I put my keys, blanking on people's names, the usual ""Is this early-onset dementia or just me being scatterbrained?"" panic. Anyway, I stumbled across Stonehenge Health Dynamic Brain and thought, ""What the heck, let's give the old noggin a tune-up."" Here's my experience after a month:

**The Good Stuff:**

1. Focus, baby! I'm not gonna say I turned into Bradley Cooper from Limitless, but I definitely noticed I could concentrate better at work. Like, I actually finished reports without checking my phone every 5 minutes. Progress!
2. Memory gains: Started remembering random trivia again. Crushed it at pub quiz night, so there's that.
3. Mood boost: Felt a bit more upbeat overall. Might be placebo, might be the supplements, might be because I finally remembered to buy toilet paper without having to write it down. Who knows?
4. Quality seems legit: Did some digging, and the ingredients look pretty solid. No weird fillers or stuff I can't pronounce.

**The Not-So-Great:**

1. Price tag made me wince: Seriously, my wallet felt this one. It's like, do I want a sharper mind or do I want to eat this month?
2. Patience required: Didn't feel much for the first couple weeks. Almost gave up, but then things started kicking in. Guess my brain needed time to wake up and smell the cognitive enhancement.
3. Pills are horse-sized: If you struggle with swallowing pills, heads up. These bad boys are not small.
4. Mild headaches: Got a few headaches in the first week. They went away, but worth mentioning.

**Random Observations:**

* The ""mental energy"" they advertise is real, but it's subtle. Don't expect to feel like you've downed five espressos.
* Had some funky, vivid dreams. Not sure if it's related, but my dreamscape has been wild.
* Noticed I'm less irritable in traffic. Could be the mood boost, or maybe I'm just finally accepting that I live in a city with awful drivers.

**Bottom Line:** 

Is it a miracle brain-booster? Nah. But I do feel sharper, and that's something. I'd give it a 7.5/10. Might keep using it, but I'll probably wait for a sale or look for a cheaper alternative that has similar ingredients.

Anyone else try this stuff? Or got any other tips for keeping the brain cells firing on all cylinders? Drop 'em below!

If I'm stressed or anxious, I start to overthink my bladder and feel like my bladder is going to fail at any moment. Usually if I have to go to a place where there is no access to the bathroom or it would be inappropriate to go to the bathroom, I start to worry about what if I pee my pants in front of everyone. Over the years, I've learned to control my anxiety and even sometimes got rid of the problem, but recently the problem returned and I haven't even been able to sleep properly. I am afraid that my life will be wasted and I will end up messing up. I try not to limit my life because of this anxiety, but it's not always easy. 

I'm going to see a therapist to talk about it because I think it's due to trauma as a child. I also started meditating and have stopped drinking alcohol, tobacco, and drinking less coffee. In my family we also has mental health issues, so I've learned that my mental health is the most important thing to me in life. I don't want to lose it, but sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind.

1g18di5,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1g18di5/the_silent_one_part_1/,The Silent One (part 1),"Another work week had come to an end. Antony Collins closed his folder with documents of his very recent case and put it back on the shelf with all the rest. With a single press on the off button, he quickly turned his work computer off. And finally, lights off, and locking of his office meant a beginning of the weekend. Antony loved the Fridays.

He rode his car through the streets enlightened with bright street lights under the already dark night sky. The people were out to have a great time at some bar or to have a nice dinner at some restaurant, or to just walk around.

Even the best lawyers in town deserve some great time out, he said to himself while entering the parking lot of the Ragussa Pub.

Inside, the atmosphere was electric with anticipation and the release of a long week’s tension. It was warm and lively, with a sense of camaraderie and shared relief that ripples through the room. It was dimly lit with dark wood beams, exposed brick walls, and a long, polished bar lined with stools. Tables were scattered across the scuffed floor, and a cozy, timeworn atmosphere filled the snug, intimate space.

Now he was looking for his table, and there it was. At the corner, by the big window that was opening towards a wonderful sight to the harbor. His group’s favorite place.

“Hey, lil’ hustler!” Jim greeted him, raising his pint.

“Joke’s on you, I’m getting paid overtime,” Anthony grinned, taking a sip of his beer.

“Overtime? For what? Filing complaints about our coffee machine?” Sarah teased.

“Nah, for making sure you guys don’t get sued after nights like this.” Anthony winked.

“Cheers to our future defense attorney!” Jim laughed, clinking glasses.

The night went the best it could. The three lawyers needed that beer and relief after their exhausting working week.

Anthony was now driving slowly and carefully looking for police patrolling somewhere. Even being among the best lawyers in the town with the experience and skills that he had, he couldn’t defend himself from getting his driving lisence taken for drunk driving. Still he felt sober enough to drive back home.

The neighborhood was quiet. Only the soft rustling of leaves could be heard under the gentle breeze, and his footsteps crunching through the fallen leaves seemed the loudest sound in the stillness. But then, everything stopped. The wind died down abruptly, leaving an eerie silence hanging in the air. Anthony paused, his senses on edge. The only sound now was his own racing heartbeat. Something felt off.

“Maybe four pints was one too many,” he muttered to himself, trying to shake off the unease. With a nervous chuckle, he headed inside for some much-needed sleep.

Sunday was a fishing day, and a day to drive the Chevy truck. Anthony drove past Jim’s house, the truck bed loaded with gear, and together they headed to the small pond just outside town. The air was crisp, with the scent of pine and damp soil, and the trees surrounding the water were ablaze with autumn colors: fiery reds, vibrant oranges, and golden yellows reflected in the still surface of the pond. The sulence was only broken by the occasional rustle of leaves and the soft plop of a fish jumping.

Anthony cast his line, watching the bobber float peacefully. “You know, Jim,” he said, “sometimes I think about quitting the law and just doing this for a living.”
Jim snorted. “Fishing?”

“Yeah,” Anthony grinned. “Think about it. No deadlines, no paperwork. Just us, the fish, and that one beaver over there that probably hates us.”

Jim laughed, casting his own line. “Sure, but you’d miss the thrill of defending people who can’t tell a lie from a laminated document.”

“True,” Anthony admitted. “But at least out here, the only thing trying to bite me is the fish.”

“Don’t forget the mosquitoes,” Jim added, swatting at his arm. “I’m pretty sure they’re on retainer.”

Anthony chuckled. “Guess they don’t know I’m billing them for overtime, too.”

But Jim didn’t respond. He kept silent instead. The occassional buzz of the mosquitoes vanished. The jumping of the fish stopped. No sound could be heard for a moment. Anthony looked around. The silence seemed so unnatural and so oppressive, as if it was pressing down on his chest, making his breathing heavy and his heartbeat stong enough so he would feel it in his ears.

But it went away, all of a sudden. Anthony could swear that he saw a silhouette between the trees on the oposite side of the pond, but Jim seemed that he didn’t notice anything. And as Anthony turned his head back to the water, something pulled his bait down in the pond. He pulled it back firmly, and there it was, a catfish almost a meter long, pulling against the fishing reel.

Jim jumped out of excitement.

“Well done, lil’ hustler!”, Jim yelled, while grabbing the big hook on a long, wooden handle to help Anthony pull the fish out of the water.

They were happy to catch a great dinner. In the evening that followed, Jim was in Anthony’s kitchen helping him with the cooking.

As they sat down to dinner, Anthony served the golden-brown catfish alongside crispy hushpuppies and a fresh salad.

“Here’s to a successful catch and a great dinner!” Anthony raised his glass, and Jim joined in, clinking his drink against Anthony’s.

“Cheers to our fishing skills! May our next catch be even bigger,” Jim added with a grin, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

They dug into the meal, the tender catfish was flaky and flavorful. Between bites, they talked about the day’s adventures, recounting how Jim had almost lost his balance while trying to help pull the fish with the hook.

“I swear I saw you about to take a dip!” Anthony laughed, wiping his mouth. “Next time, I’ll tie you to a tree.”

“Only if you promise to jump in after me if I go overboard!” Jim shot back, chuckling. 
“Deal!” Anthony replied, raising his glass again.

As they continued to eat, the conversation flowed effortlessly, filled with inside jokes and teasing. The warmth of friendship enveloped them, making the simple meal feel like a feast.

“Man, if every Sunday was like this, I’d never want to go back to work,” Jim said, leaning back contentedly in his chair.

“Agreed,” Anthony said, smiling. “Just us, the fish, and no emails.” 

The laughter and joy lingered long into the evening, leaving behind memories of a perfect day spent together. But one thing was was unclear to Anthony. Was he losing his mind?

Monday arrived, and Anthony was back in his office like every other workday. The low hum of the fluorescent lights provided a familiar, almost comforting presence, buzzing softly in every corner of the building. He was buried in a complex case, papers strewn across his desk as he tried to make sense of the overwhelming evidence. The mental strain finally caught up with him, and a sudden, pounding headache hit him hard. Standing up too quickly, he felt dizzy and nauseous.

The walk to the bathroom felt endless as his steps wobbled unsteadily. Just as he reached the door of his office, everything went silent, abruptly, unnaturally. That same uneasy feeling crept up his spine, like he was being watched. His heart skipped as he saw it again, a silhouette, standing motionless in front of the bathroom door at the end of the hall. 

He blinked, rubbing his eyes, and it vanished. The strange feeling lifted with it, the nausea fading. The hum of the lights returned, and the world felt normal again. But Anthony couldn’t shake the lingering chill that remained.

“Hey, buddy,” Jim called out from his office, peeking from behind the door. “You all right?”

Anthony leaned against the wall, still trying to catch his breath. “Yeah, man. I’m good,” he replied, his voice sounding exhausted and distant.

Jim stepped closer, his eyes widening as he got a better look at Anthony. “You’re pale like a dead man,” he said, quickly closing the distance between them. “Seriously, what’s up?”

Anthony forced a weak smile and put a hand on Jim’s shoulder. “I’m totally alright,” he said, trying to sound convincing. “Just… overworked. Too many late nights.”

Before Jim could respond, Sarah appeared at the end of the hall. Her eyes flicked nervously between the two of them, taking in Anthony’s pale face and uneasy stance.

“Hey, Anthony,” she said, her voice a little higher than usual. “You okay? You don’t look so good.”

“I’m fine,” Anthony insisted, straightening up and trying to sound more normal. “Just a headache. It’s nothing.”

Sarah hesitated, glancing around the hallway nervously. “Are you sure? You really don’t look well.”

“Yeah, I promise,” Anthony said, forcing another smile. “I just need to get some air, maybe grab a coffee.”

Jim still looked skeptical, but he nodded slowly. “Okay, but don’t push yourself, man. You really look like you need a break.”

Sarah nodded in agreement, her gaze darting around the hall again before she looked back at Anthony. “Yeah, take it easy. It’s just… you seem really out of it today.”

Anthony sighed, feeling the weight of their concern. “I’ll be fine,” he reassured them, though the words felt hollow. He could see the doubt in their eyes, especially Sarah’s, who kept glancing around as if she was searching for something.

“Okay,” she said softly, still watching him carefully. “But if you need anything, just let us know.”

“Thanks, guys,” Anthony said, his voice a little more steady now. “I appreciate it.”

As the days passed, Anthony couldn’t shake the unsettling feeling of being watched. As if the sudden silences weren’t unnerving enough, it was the shadowy silhouette that kept appearing, lingering at the edge of his vision, that truly disturbed him. None of it made any sense, yet the occurrences grew more frequent, each one tightening the grip of anxiety and paranoia around him. Was he losing his mind?

One rainy night, the three of them gathered at their usual pub. The storm outside was relentless, raindrops tapping steadily against the windows as if trying to join the conversation. The warm light inside contrasted sharply with the gloomy weather, casting a cozy glow over the group as they took their drinks.

Anthony took a long sip of his beer and then, after weeks of holding it in, finally spoke up. “I’ve been seeing something,” he began, his voice low but serious. Jim and Sarah looked up from their glasses, curious.

“Seeing what?” Jim asked, raising an eyebrow.

Anthony hesitated, then took a deep breath. “A shadowy figure. It’s been appearing around me, at home, at work. And every time, everything goes completely silent. No sound, nothing. It’s… it’s like the world just stops.”

Jim snorted, shaking his head with a smile. “You’ve been watching too many horror movies, man,” he said, leaning back in his chair. “Come on, you’re telling us you’ve got your own personal ghost now?”

But Sarah’s expression didn’t change. She stayed silent, her eyes locked on Anthony as if trying to gauge how serious he was. “When did this start?” she asked quietly.

“A few weeks ago,” Anthony replied, glancing around nervously. “It’s been happening more often lately. I didn’t want to say anything because it sounds crazy, but I swear it’s real.”

Jim rolled his eyes. “Okay, so let me get this straight. You see a shadow, everything goes quiet, and what? This thing just stands there staring at you?”

“Pretty much,” Anthony said, looking down at his hands. “It’s like it’s watching me, waiting for something.”

“Sounds like a bad dream,” Jim said, dismissing it with a wave. “I bet it’s just stress messing with your head.”

Before Anthony could respond, a heavy silence fell over the pub, so abrupt that it was almost tangible. The usual chatter, the clinking of glasses, even the rain outside, all of it ceased. The three of them froze, eyes widening in unison. Also, all the other patrons stared outside, utterly silent.

Then, through the pub’s large front window, they saw it: a tall, dark figure standing motionless across the street, barely illuminated by the streetlights. Its faceless silhouette seemed to blend into the shadows, an unsettling presence that sent a shiver down Anthony’s spine.

Jim’s face went pale as he stared at the figure. “What the hell is that?” he whispered, his voice barely audible.

Anthony swallowed hard, his throat dry. “That’s what I’ve been talking about,” he said shakily. “That’s it.”

Sarah, who had been watching the figure intently, suddenly looked at Anthony with something like fear in her eyes. “We need to talk,” she said, her voice urgent and trembling. “In private.”

And all of a sudden, all the sounds came back.

“Why? What’s going on?” Jim asked, as much confused as he was scared.

“Now,” she insisted, grabbing Anthony’s arm and pulling him away from the table. They hurried towards a quieter corner of the pub, leaving Jim staring after them, his expression a mixture of confusion and dread.

“What do you know about this?” Anthony demanded as soon as they were alone, his heart pounding.

Sarah glanced over her shoulder, then back at him, her eyes were wide, filled with fear. “It’s called The Silent One,” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the ambient noise of the pub. “It’s not just a ghost or a figment of your imagination. It’s a summoned entity, a kind of dark spirit that obeys the will of whoever calls it.”

“A summoned entity?” Anthony repeated, struggling to comprehend. “How do you summon something like that?”

Sarah looked around again, as if she feared the walls themselves were listening. “There’s a ritual,” she said quietly. “It involves candles, blood, and a specific incantation. The person performing the ritual has to offer their own blood as fail-safe and stay absolutely silent until the job is done. The moment they make a sound, even the faintest whisper, The Silent One turns on them instead.”

“The job?” Anthony was confused. “What do you mean?”

Sarah continued. “A job is given to the entity to kill someone you ask it to. The blood of the victim is offered to it. But if the summoner breaks any rule, mostly the silence rule, The Silent One turns against them.”

Anthony felt his skin crawl. “How do you know all this?”

She hesitated, her eyes distant as if remembering something painful. “Because it happened to me once,” she said, her voice breaking slightly.

Anthony stared at her, stunned. “What? When?”

“A few years ago,” she said, glancing down at her trembling hands. “I defended this guy in court. A real psychopath. He killed eleven people in a mall shooting. I tried to get his sentence reduced, but I failed. He got life in prison.”

She took a deep breath, steadying herself before continuing. “After the trial, I started seeing things, just like you’re describing. The shadow, the silence. I thought I was losing my mind. Then, I got a call from the prison. They told me the man had performed some sort of ritual in his cell, calling it to kill me.”

Anthony’s heart sank. “But you’re still here.”

Sarah nodded, swallowing hard. “He broke the silence rule,” she said, her voice trembling. “He couldn’t keep quiet, even with his life on the line. He couldn’t resist to brag about it to the guards, and that was enough. The Silent One turned on him and… slit his throat with its silver knife. The guards saw it happen. They couldn’t explain it, but they saw it.”

Anthony’s mind was racing. “Is there any way to stop it?”

Sarah shook her head slowly, her eyes filled with despair. “No, Anthony. Once it’s summoned, it won’t stop until it’s done. But there’s one thing you can do to delay it: stay silent. It hunts by sound. If you stay quiet, you can keep it from coming closer. It’ll stay at the distance it’s already at, but it won’t go away. It’s just… delayed.”

Anthony felt a cold sweat break out on his forehead. “So, I just… don’t speak?”

Sarah nodded. “Exactly. But it’s only a temporary solution. It’s still out there, waiting. The silence just holds it off. It can’t make it leave.”

He took a deep breath, feeling trapped. “And the person who summoned it? They have to stay silent too?”

“Yes,” Sarah said. “One sound, and it turns on them. That’s how it works. The question is…” she looked at him, her expression dark with fear, “who would go through all of that to summon it for you, Anthony? Who wants you dead so badly that they’d risk their own life?”",2,1728648970.0,horrorstories,2,1.0,False

The bride and groom are offering a water station and a cash bar during cocktail hour, and 2 drink vouchers during dinner service. This seems….somewhat standard, right? But then here’s the kicker: during the cocktail hour, all drinks except water will be at the cash bar, which includes all non-alcoholic drinks. The 2 drink vouchers during dinner service will ALSO include all non-alcoholic drinks as well.

Bluntly put, I don’t know if they’re cheap, or I’m snobby. But a wedding reception at a country club that wouldn’t provide complimentary sodas/juice/tea/coffee/etc.? I mean I get the whole 2-drink voucher and the cash bar for all alcohol, but the other stuff as well? And considering their guest list, not many people going are gonna be big drinkers anyway. There will be a lot of senior citizens in their 80’s and 90’s who will drink nothing but hot tea/coffee and trying to imagine the fact that they might possibly have to pay $6-$8 for each of those (I mean it’s a country club after all, you never know) seems absolutely preposterous. I’ve asked several friends from different backgrounds and they all think it’s tacky as well. Please enlighten and put me in my place if this is the norm and socially acceptable for a wedding at a country club where the bride and groom each make a 6-figure annual salary, and the guest list is around 100-150 people. Like I make a fraction of that, and I still plan to make all soft drinks/coffee/tea complimentary at my reception. #TACKY #CRINGE",64,1728648883.0,weddingshaming,19,0.9,False
