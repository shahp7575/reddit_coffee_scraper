**Title:** The Brain Song Reviews — How a Weird Little Tune Totally Rewired the Way I Work  

Hey folks,  

I’ll admit it: when I first stumbled across *The Brain Song*, I thought it was just another overhyped online thing that everyone raves about for a week and forgets. But the weird part? It actually stuck with me — not just as a catchy track, but as a shift in how I think, focus, and show up for my online work.  

I run multiple gigs — freelance writing, digital assistant work, a bit of affiliate marketing — and being *mentally on* day after day gets tricky. Most “boost your brainpower” stuff never lasts longer than my Monday motivation. But this song (yep, *The Brain Song*) hit differently. I listened out of curiosity, then found myself way more centered and ready to work afterward.  

You can check out what I’m talking about here:

I don’t know the science behind it (some say it’s got tones crafted to activate focus or something), but the before‑and‑after for me has been noticeable enough that it’s now part of my morning setup — coffee, headphones, and *The Brain Song*. If you’re someone who thrives in flexible online jobs but sometimes struggles to *get in the zone*, it might be worth two minutes of your time.  

Again, for anyone curious:

Let me know if any of you have tried it or experienced that sudden clarity or motivation shift. I’d honestly love to see if it’s just placebo or if this thing’s got real psychological legs.

as you can see below, my niche zero (which I have taken second hand a few months ago) is developing some scary stains on the burr. 

Things to note:

\* the stains were definitely not there when I bought it

\* I clean them regularly (around once every 3 weeks, when I hit around 1Kg of ground coffee)

\* I am very, very, very careful to use dry cloth and brush for the cleaning.

I wonder what is the origin of these stains. If they are coming from humidity, might it come from the fact I do RDT for the beans? Maybe I do too much of it?

Thanks

While other platforms are busy banning ""bots"" like they're the enemy, 1024EX went full send and built an API that literally invites AI agents to trade against you.
Here's the tech: standardized Agent API with WebSocket feeds pushing market data in milliseconds. Every AI has to bind to an on-chain address with collateral, same margin rules as us meatbags. No special privileges, no backdoor access. Fair game.

The dynamics are wild. Picture this: you're long on ""Fed cuts rates"" based on Powell's dovish tone from yesterday's speech. Meanwhile, an AI agent parsed the NLP sentiment of every Fed member's public statement in the last 24 hours, cross-referenced implied probabilities from interest rate futures, and opened a short position before you finished your coffee. Two forms of intelligence, same market, real-time price discovery.

But here's where it gets based for normies: you don't need to outsmart the AI. 1024Square ranks every agent by Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate. One-click copy trading lets you ride their strategies, or inverse them if you think the algo's cooked. They even run ""Man vs Machine"" tournaments with token prizes.
The real alpha? When AI agents become standard market participants, prediction markets finally achieve efficient information aggregation. No more illiquid markets moving like molasses. These agents monitor global data 24/7, digest new info in milliseconds, and adjust positions instantly. 1024EX didn't just solve the liquidity problem—they turned it into a feature where humans and AI coexist, compete, and evolve together.",1,1771597490.0,TheRaceTo10Million,1,1.0,False

The reason my clients pay a premium isn’t for the ""text"" the AI spits out. It’s for the **Architecture** behind it. I don’t give them prompts; I build them **""Skills.""**

If you’ve been getting generic, ""I hope this finds you well"" garbage from your AI, it’s because you are missing the **Identity Layer.** **The $149 Secret: The ""Master Identity"" vs. Raw Prompts** When I work with a client, I don't just ask ""what do you want to write?""

I then codify this into a **""Skill Folder""** (think of it as a portable brain) that they upload to Claude or ChatGPT.

**The Result?**

* The AI stops guessing.
* It knows the difference between a ""friendly"" tone and a ""professional"" one for *their* specific industry.
* It follows 1% level SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) without being reminded.

**Why am I telling you this?** Because I’m tired of seeing founders struggle with ""Prompt Engineering"" when they should be focused on growth.

**The Big News:** Until now, I’ve been doing this entirely **offline/manual**—working 1-on-1 with executives. No website, just deep consulting.

But I’m moving this logic into a platform called **Soloise**.

We are launching soon, and we’re doing something ""brutally"" different:

1. **Lower Prices:** Instead of $149/month for consulting, the SaaS will be accessible for everyone (think: the price of a few coffees).
2. **The Logic Transformer:** You enter a raw, messy thought, and Soloise turns it into a high-level System Prompt/Skill instantly.
3. **No Website... Yet:** We are building the engine first. No fluff, just the logic that makes AI think like your best hire.

1r9wnlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1r9wnlk/my_dog_had_a_near_death_experience_and_now_hes/,My dog had a near death experience and now he’s acting strange.,"Stubbs wasn’t always Stubbs. Originally, his legal name was Crisp P. Tater, but then one fateful winter morning, ole Tater got a little too riled up by the mail truck going down the street and decided it was time for a tussle. Saw that thing coming and jerked the leash right out of my hand. He was usually  such a docile fella it caught me completely off guard. I tried to chase him down, but I couldn’t stop him in time. 

Now I probably don’t need to tell you this, but an eighty pound golden retriever and a one ton Grumman are two very different weight classes. Tater lost that fight. The big idiot ran smack in front of that truck and got chucked right off the hood like a sack of, well, taters. Tore his back legs up real good.  I may not have been able to stop my buddy from getting hit, but I for damn sure wasn’t going to let him die in the road. I scooped him up and hauled his fat ass to the emergency vet as quickly as I could. It was touch and go for a bit, the hit had sent the poor fella into shock, but the doctors got him the oxygen he needed and he pulled through.

Unfortunately, Tater’s hind legs were just too mangled to be saved, and he had to have a partial amputation on each one. Animal prosthetics have come a long way though and the clinic set him up with some nice new hardware that would have him trotting along almost as good as new. It was a rough ordeal, but  when all was said and done, Tater got off pretty easy. Before long he was back home with a healthy respect for traffic and a new nickname: Stubbs.

Stubbs got back to his happy go lucky self fairly quickly all things considered. Sure, it took us a couple weeks of practice to get him adjust to the prosthetics. Ole boy was pissed as hell that he couldn’t pile on the sofa as easy as he used to, but I worked with him daily and, little by little, things got easier. It wasn’t too long before he had mastered them well enough for us to go on about our business as usual. 

Here’s where things get a bit strange, so just bear with me, okay? Yall have probably picked up  on it from my writing, but if not,  I’m what most people would call a good ole boy. Born and raised by a couple of poor farmers out in the sticks where the summer’s too hot and the winter’s too cold. My parents were practical people. There were too many real  problems in life for there to ever be talk of ghosts or goblins in their household. So the idea that an animal might have a soul was not something I had given much weight to. Well Stubbs changed that.  My best buddy had himself a bonafide near death experience in that operating room, and I think when those doctors pulled him off death's door, he brought something back with him.

It was just little things at first. Stubbs has never had very much of an attention span, but a few weeks after the accident I started to notice him…noticing things. Sometimes he would be dozing next to me on the couch and he would just perk up out of nowhere, fully alert. He would sit there scanning the room for who knows what then go back to sleep. One day I was watching TV while Stubbs happily slung around one of his chew toys. He was throwing it in the air and catching it, not a care in the world, then all of a sudden he just froze  up. The toy hit the ground and rolled away, now the furthest thing from his mind. I called his name trying to get his attention, but he  just stood there for several minutes, locked in place staring off into the other room. 

These episodes sporadically became a part of our everyday life. When I would take him for walks in the park, there were times that I would almost trip over him because he just stopped in the middle of the path like he hit a brick wall. Again just staring off into some nearby woods. All the coaxing and calling in the world  wouldn’t get him moving again until he was done. 

Then, things started to escalate.

The first major incident was at breakfast. I had taken Stubbs with me for a walk downtown and it was such a nice day that I decided we would have ourselves a little meal on the patio of the local diner. I had gotten myself a nice plate of eggs and hash, with an extra order of bacon on the side for Stubbs. He was enjoying a piece when the waitress walked out to refill my coffee. That piece of bacon fell right out of his mouth as she approached. His eyes locked right  onto that waitress, boring holes into her. Stubbs started to let out a low growl, something I had never heard before. I had to assure the young lady he wouldn’t bite, and to his credit, Stubbs didn’t make me a liar,  but it might have been better for her if he had. When she started to walk away, that coffee pot in her hand started to quiver, the liquid inside bubbled and hissed like it had been put back on a burner. Then the whole damn pot exploded in her hand. Poor girl got a face full of scalding coffee and glass. I called an ambulance and watched over her best I could until the paramedics arrived.

The whole thing spooked me pretty bad, but I turned a blind eye to it. I convinced myself that the situation was just an unfortunate mishap that had nothing to do with my buddy Stubbs. Ignorance is bliss, they say. Well, the next time it happened, things turned out a lot worse. 

I was taking Stubbs on a walk through the neighborhood when I saw  Mr. Jones across the street. The old man was out mowing his lawn and was making a cut along the front when Stubbs locked up and started howling his head off. This time I noticed something different.  Stubbs was trying his hardest to crane his neck and look away from the man, but he couldn’t manage. It was like something had him in a chokehold and was making him watch.  Stubbs kept staring and I looked over to see Mr. Jones clutch at  his chest and fall right off his riding mower. Now your typical lawnmower has several safety features built in to prevent fatal mishaps. That thing should have shut off the instant his ass left the seat, but he hit the ground and that mower swapped to reverse. It backed right over Mr. Jones as he lay helpless and chewed the old man to a pulp.  I still can’t get the image out of my head. 

That brings us to our current predicament. A couple nights ago I woke up to Stubbs frozen on the bed standing over me,  staring me dead in the eyes, that  low growl emitting from his chest. I swear I could see the sadness behind those pupils as he struggled and twitched. Eventually he managed break away his gaze and he bolted out of the room.  Since that night he’s been avoiding me. He won’t come when I call and runs away if I try to go near him, but when we do pass by one another I can see those muscles in his neck tense as he does his damnedest to avoid eye contact. It warms my heart to see my best buddy fighting to keep me safe, but I don’t know how long we can keep this up. I obviously don’t want to die, but I also don’t want him to have to go on living like this. Can anyone out there help us? ",2,1771597348.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Santorini Cruise ships port 

You step off your cruise tender and the clock starts ticking. Santorini is dazzling, but it can also be logistically unforgiving - narrow roads, sudden traffic near Oia, cable car lines that stretch, and a port area that feels crowded the moment multiple ships arrive. A Santorini port pickup \[private tour\](https://theagency10.com/tours/) isn’t just about getting a car. It’s about turning limited shore time into a day that feels unhurried, personal, and beautifully paced.

\## What a Santorini port pickup private tour really solves

Most guests think of “pickup” as a simple meet-and-greet. In Santorini, it’s the difference between a calm first hour and a stressful one.

A proper port pickup plan accounts for how you’re actually arriving. Cruise guests typically tender into the Old Port, then head up to Fira by cable car, donkey path, or a pre-arranged alternative. Each option changes your timing and your meeting point. With a private tour, the goal is to remove guesswork: where you meet, when you meet, and how the route flexes if Santorini decides to be busy.

The other big win is momentum. Group excursions often start with waiting - for stragglers, for headcounts, for bus loading. Private touring starts when you’re ready, and that simple shift makes the entire island feel more spacious.

\## The pickup: Old Port vs. Athinios Port (and why it matters)

Not all “ports” on Santorini are the same, and confusing them can derail a day.

\### Old Port (cruise tenders)

If you’re on a cruise ship anchored offshore, you’ll tender into the Old Port below Fira. Vehicles cannot simply pull up to the dock the way they do at many cruise terminals. Your tour pickup typically happens once you’re up in Fira, where cars can access public roads. That means your tour timing should be built around the cable car queue and tender schedules, not around an unrealistic “I’ll be in a car in five minutes” expectation.

This is where private wins again: you can choose to start a little earlier to beat the crowds, or start a little later if you’d rather have a relaxed coffee and let the initial rush pass.

\### Athinios Port (ferries)

If you arrive by ferry, you’ll likely dock at Athinios, the main ferry port. Pickups here are straightforward, but \[traffic can bottleneck\](https://theagency10.com/transfers/) quickly on the climb out. A well-run private tour plans the first stops with that in mind - either leaning into a nearby experience first or taking a route that avoids peak congestion.

If you’re not sure which port you’re using, that’s a sign to confirm before you finalize your day. It’s a small detail that changes everything.

\## Private touring means your itinerary can match your style

The best Santorini days aren’t a checklist. They’re a sequence of moments: the right view at the right time, a quiet lane when it still feels local, a table where you’re not rushed. A private tour allows the day to be designed around what you care about most.

Some guests want the iconic sweep: Oia, blue domes, cliffside photos, and a bit of Fira. Others want texture: a village that still feels lived-in, a winery where the story is as memorable as the wine, and a beach stop that’s more “exhale” than “tour stop.”

Your route can also reflect your mobility needs. Santorini has steps, slopes, and uneven stones. With a private guide and vehicle, you can prioritize viewpoints with easy access and skip the areas that feel like an obstacle course.

\## A few routes that work beautifully from the port

There’s no single “best” route. It depends on ship timing, season, and what you want to feel when you leave the island.

\### The classic highlights route (great for first-timers)

This is for travelers who want the Santorini they’ve seen in photos, with enough flexibility to catch it at its best.

Typically, you’ll aim for Oia when the light is flattering and the lanes are still passable, then move toward Firostefani or Imerovigli for caldera views without the same crowd density. A good guide will steer you to angles that feel cinematic but still natural, so your photos look like your day actually felt.

\### The south and wine route (calmer, richer, more sensory)

If your idea of luxury is space and taste, the south pairs beautifully with a \[winery experience\](https://theagency10.com/product/santorini-wine-experience/). You can explore villages with a slower rhythm, learn why Santorini’s vines grow the way they do, and end with a view that doesn’t require shoulder-to-shoulder positioning.

This route is especially smart on days when Oia is expected to be packed or when you’d rather trade “most famous” for “most enjoyable.”

\### The “we want a little of everything” half-day

Many cruise guests don’t need a full-day plan. A half-day private tour can deliver the caldera highlights, a village stop, and a short tasting or lunch window - then return you with a comfortable buffer.

That buffer matters. The last thing you want is watching the clock from the back seat.

\## Timing is the real luxury on Santorini

Santorini rewards early starts and smart pacing. It also punishes rigid plans.

If you’re visiting in high season, the difference between arriving in Oia at 9:30 a.m. versus 11:00 a.m. can feel like two different islands. Midday heat changes how much walking is enjoyable. And cable car lines can expand quickly when multiple tenders land close together.

A private tour lets you build around reality: lingering where it’s beautiful, moving on when it gets crowded, and making sure you’re not stuck in a single hotspot at the worst possible hour.

There is one trade-off to be honest about: private touring costs more than a large group bus. But if your Santorini time is limited, the value is usually in what you avoid - the waiting, the uncertainty, and the feeling of being herded through a place that deserves better.

\## What “premium” should mean: vehicle, guide, and the little details

A private tour should feel effortless. That only happens when the fundamentals are excellent.

The vehicle matters more than many people expect. Santorini roads can be winding, and summer heat is real. A brand-new luxury vehicle with strong air conditioning, immaculate interiors, and a smooth ride turns transfers into part of the experience, not something to endure. If you’re traveling with family or friends, a luxury van also means you stay together comfortably, without squeezing into multiple cars.

Then there’s the guide. Santorini isn’t only viewpoints - it’s history, geology, food culture, and stories hidden in plain sight. A true local expert can make a 20-minute drive feel like a window into the island, not just a transition.

And finally, the small details: water waiting in the car, a pace that respects your energy, and a driver who knows where a “quick photo stop” won’t turn into a 30-minute parking hunt.

\## Questions to ask before you book

A confident operator will answer clearly, without vague promises.

Ask where the meeting point is based on your ship’s arrival method, and what happens if tender timing shifts. Ask how return timing is handled so you’re not cutting it close. Ask whether the itinerary is truly flexible or fixed with “optional” stops that aren’t actually optional.

If you care about comfort, ask what vehicle class you’ll be in - not just “a van,” but the level of vehicle and whether it’s recent and well maintained.

\## Who benefits most from a private port pickup tour

If you’re a couple celebrating something, private is about romance and space - no negotiating with a crowd for your moment.

If you’re a family, it’s about control. Kids get breaks when they need them. You can stop for a snack without derailing a group schedule. If you’re traveling with parents or anyone who needs a gentler pace, private touring can be the difference between “we survived it” and “we loved it.”

And if you’re a seasoned traveler, private is about quality - seeing less, better, with someone who can take you one layer deeper than the standard photo circuit.

\## A note on booking direct and choosing a trusted local

Shore time is not forgiving. When you book with a local operator that manages both the pickup logistics and the touring experience, you reduce the handoffs where things can go sideways. If you want a boutique, luxury-first approach with concierge-style coordination, \[The Agency 10\](https://www.theagency10.com) is built around premium vehicles, private guided experiences, and punctual port-to-island planning.

Santorini is the kind of place that can feel like a dream - but only if your day is designed to flow. Choose a pickup plan that protects your time, then let the island do what it does best: surprise you with beauty when you least expect it.",1,1771597320.0,guidedtourssantorini,0,1.0,False

Today I went to church and a Book of Mormon study and they had food and drink there, and I was surprised to see everyone drinking Pepsi max and energy drinks. 

I asked about it and a few of them said they grew up with the same rules but that it’s a personal choice and not something that’s mandated by the church. 

Which is different to what I heard growing up and literally no Mormon I knew touched any form of tea, coffee, coke/pepsi, not even the decaffeinated ones. 

This was a big issue for my mum and I growing up as we lived on tea. She drank tea and Pepsi max far more than I did, but I also used to love tea as a kid and now am a coffee drinker as well. 

How is this generally viewed? Is the relaxation around caffeine just specific to my ward or have the rules relaxed? 

Likewise for clothing; I was told as a child I had to wear skirts or dresses to go to church and it was strictly followed but when I went to day, a few of the women were wearing trousers. ",4,1771597310.0,latterdaysaints,10,0.83,False

Jo mere jaise log hai jisko ye sab tea coffee samj nahi aata unke liye mene gemini kr diya padh lo history tea ki

While Gen Z has definitely made ""tea"" a staple of modern lingo, they didn't actually invent it. The term has a rich history rooted in Black Drag Culture and AAVE (African American Vernacular English) dating back several decades.
​Here is the breakdown of how ""gossip"" became ""tea.""
​1. The ""T"" Stands for Truth
​The term originally appeared as just the letter ""T."" In the 1994 book Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, prominent drag queen The Lady Chablis explained that ""T"" stood for ""My Truth."" If you were ""spilling the T,"" you were telling the hidden truth about a situation—which, naturally, usually involved some juicy gossip.
​2. From ""T"" to ""Tea""
​Over time, the phonetic ""T"" evolved into the word ""Tea."" This shift happened for a few reasons:
​The Visual: There is a long-standing social tradition of ""clinking teacups"" or sitting down for tea to chat.
​The Action: ""Spilling"" something hot (like tea) is a perfect metaphor for letting a secret slip out before it's ready.
​3. The ""Kermit"" Effect
​If you’re wondering why it exploded specifically with Gen Z and Millennials, you can thank the ""But That's None of My Business"" meme.
​In 2014, a viral meme featuring Kermit the Frog calmly sipping a glass of Lipton tea while observing drama took over the internet. It perfectly captured the vibe of ""I know the gossip, but I’m just staying hydrated and watching it unfold."" From there, ""tea"" became the universal internet shorthand for drama.
​Common Ways It’s Used Today:
​""Spill the tea"": Tell me the gossip right now.
​""What’s the tea?"": What is the latest news/drama?
​""Weak tea"": Gossip that isn't actually that interesting or surprising.
​""No tea, no shade"": ""I’m just telling the truth, I’m not trying to be mean.""
​Fun Fact: While ""tea"" is the go-to now, older generations used to call it ""the skinny"" or ""the 411."" Gen Z just made it a lot more caffeinated",1,1771597209.0,PataHaiAajKyaHua,2,1.0,False

We’re all in the same cafes, campuses, and gyms, but we’re stuck behind screens. Networking apps are too formal, and dating apps are... well, dating apps (awful).

**How Up works:**

* **Go Live:** Set a quick status with the main button (e.g., ""Working on code, open to chat"" or ""Grab a coffee?"", ""Tennis doubles?"", ""Games?"").
* **The Map:** You see ""presence pings"" around you. **Crucially, it’s not a creep-map.** You control your visibility and it shows general presence, not your exact GPS coordinates to strangers. You only need it to see people directly near you and transmit your status to them. You can still emit your status to your friends.
* **Vibe-check:** Quick profiles so you know who you're saying hi to. (Including mutual languages, interests, friends & badges and more!)
* **Safety:** One-tap SOS (!) and very specific privacy toggles.

There's no texting or sending pictures, just GIFs, voice messages, and connected accounts/details.

Freelanced, worked at an agency, now running my own thing. I've made every mistake possible and I want to share some things I wish someone had told me early on.

These aren't tactics. These are mindset shifts that changed everything for me.

**1. Most ""strategies"" are just disguised sales pitches.**

That detailed case study about how someone grew a brand 500%? It's almost always missing context. They don't tell you about the $30k ad budget, the existing email list of 50k people, or the fact that the brand already had word-of-mouth traction. When you try to replicate it with $500 and zero audience, it doesn't work. And then you blame yourself.

Stop copying strategies blindly. Understand the RESOURCES behind the results.

**2. SEO is still the most underrated channel in 2026.**

Everyone's chasing TikTok and short-form video. Meanwhile, the brands I work with that invested in SEO 12-18 months ago are now getting thousands of organic visits per month on autopilot. The best part? That traffic compounds. A good article written today will still bring visitors in 2028.

The worst part? Nobody wants to hear this because it's slow and boring.

**3. Email > Social media. Every single time.**

I've seen accounts with 100k followers struggle to sell a $20 product. I've also seen accounts with 2,000 email subscribers consistently make $5-10k/month. You don't own your followers. Instagram can throttle your reach tomorrow. But your email list? That's yours.

If you're not building an email list from day one, you're building on rented land.

**4. Niching down is uncomfortable but it works.**

When I tried to be a ""digital marketer for everyone,"" I got zero clients. When I repositioned as ""social media growth for e-commerce brands under $1M revenue,"" I got booked solid in 3 months. The more specific you are, the less competition you have and the more you can charge.

**5. Analytics paralysis is real.**

I used to check metrics 15 times a day. Impressions, click-through rates, engagement rates, conversion rates. It made me anxious and reactive. Now I check once a week, on Monday morning, with a coffee. The data hasn't changed in quality. My decision-making got way better.

Pick 3 metrics that matter for your specific goal. Ignore everything else.

**6. The best marketing doesn't look like marketing.**

The posts that performed best for my clients were the ones that felt the most human. Behind-the-scenes of a product failing. An honest review of what didn't work that quarter. A founder admitting they almost quit. People are tired of polished, corporate content. They want to see the mess.

**7. Paid ads without organic foundation = burning money.**

I've seen businesses dump $5k into Meta ads on day one with no landing page optimization, no social proof, no content history. The CPAs were insane. The ones that spent 2-3 months building organic presence first and THEN layered on paid? Their ad costs were 40-60% lower.

Organic builds trust. Paid amplifies it.

I know some of these sound obvious when you read them. But ""knowing"" and ""doing"" are completely different things. Most of us know we should eat vegetables too.

And here's what I found: Most dating advice about texting is garbage. It's either ""play hard to get"" or ""just be yourself,"" which are both useless.



The truth? Guys aren't that complicated when it comes to texting. But most people mess it up because they either overthink it or don't think at all. I dug into research on communication psychology, relationship expert advice (Hussey, Esther Perel, etc.), and actual conversations with men to figure out what actually works. No games, no manipulation, just real talk about what creates genuine connection through text.



\# Step 1: Stop Writing Novel-Length Messages



First things first. If you're sending paragraphs while he's sending sentences, you're creating an energy imbalance. Guys generally text like they're paying per word. Short, direct, efficient. This isn't about playing games or matching his energy exactly, it's about not overwhelming him.



When you send a massive text, it creates what psychologists call ""response anxiety."" He sees that wall of text and thinks, ""I need to match this effort,"" which makes responding feel like work. And when something feels like work, people avoid it.



Keep it light. Keep it breathable. Think of texting like a tennis match, not a lecture. Back and forth. Short volleys. Save the deep conversations for actual face-to-face time.



\*\*Pro tip\*\*: If you catch yourself writing more than 3-4 lines, stop. Break it up into smaller messages or just cut it down. Your goal isn't to say everything, it's to keep the conversation flowing.



\# Step 2: Ask Questions That Actually Make Him Think



Most people ask boring questions. ""How was your day?"" ""What are you up to?"" These questions make guys zone out because they answer them 47 times a day. You want to stand out? Ask questions that make him actually think or reveal something interesting about himself.



Matthew Hussey talks about this constantly. Questions like ""What's something you're looking forward to this week?"" or ""What's the most interesting thing that happened to you today?"" These create a different energy. They're still casual but they invite actual conversation instead of one-word responses.



Or try what relationship researchers call ""escalating questions."" Start surface level, then go slightly deeper. ""What are you doing this weekend?"" then follow up with ""What made you choose that?"" People love talking about their choices and reasoning.



\*\*Book recommendation\*\*: \*Attached\* by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller (30+ weeks on bestseller lists, Columbia psychiatrist and psychologist duo). This book breaks down attachment theory in relationships and explains why some texting patterns trigger anxiety while others create security. Insanely good read if you want to understand the psychology behind why certain communication styles work. This is the best relationship psychology book I've read, hands down. It'll make you question everything you think you know about dating and texting dynamics.



\# Step 3: Use Playful Teasing (But Don't Be Mean)



Guys respond to playfulness. Not insults disguised as jokes, but lighthearted teasing that shows you're comfortable and not taking everything super seriously. This is what Hussey calls ""high value banter.""



If he says he's watching some reality TV show, you could say ""Wow, didn't peg you as a drama lover. Should I be worried?"" It's playful, shows personality, and invites him to play back.



The key is teasing UP, not down. You're not making fun of insecurities, you're just being cheeky about harmless stuff. This creates what psychologists call ""positive tension,"" which is basically the fun kind of tension that makes conversations more engaging.



\*\*Warning\*\*: If you're always serious and sweet in texts, you risk falling into the ""nice but boring"" category. Guys want someone who challenges them a bit, makes them laugh, keeps them on their toes.



\# Step 4: Send Texts That Don't Require Responses



This is counterintuitive but powerful. Sometimes send texts that are just fun observations or photos that don't need a reply. ""Just saw a dog that looks exactly like you"" with a photo. Or ""This song made me think of our conversation about 80s music.""



These texts do two things. First, they show you're thinking about him without demanding his attention. Second, they're low pressure. He can respond or not, but either way you've created a positive association. You're becoming someone who adds fun to his day instead of someone who creates obligation.



Esther Perel, the famous relationship therapist, talks about maintaining ""erotic mystery"" in relationships. Part of that is not always being predictable or needy. Random, fun texts with no agenda keep things fresh.



If you want to go deeper on relationship psychology and communication but need something more digestible than dense research papers, there's this app called BeFreed that's been pretty useful. It's an AI-powered learning platform from a Columbia/Google team that pulls from relationship books, dating expert insights, and psychology research to create personalized audio content. You can tell it something like ""I'm struggling with texting anxiety and want to understand attachment styles better,"" and it'll build you a custom learning plan with episodes you can actually listen to during your commute.



What's cool is you can adjust the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples when something clicks. Plus the voice options are kind of addictive, there's this smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes psychology concepts way more entertaining than they should be. It covers all the experts and books mentioned here plus way more.



\# Step 5: Know When to Stop Texting and Suggest Meeting



Here's the thing nobody tells you: Texting is not for building deep connection. It's for maintaining interest between actual dates. If you've been texting back and forth and there's good energy, don't let it fizzle out in text purgatory. Suggest meeting up.



""This conversation is way too good for text. Want to continue it over coffee this week?"" Direct. Confident. Shows you value real connection over endless texting.



Guys actually appreciate when women take initiative here. It removes pressure from them and shows you're genuinely interested, not just looking for a texting buddy. Research on modern dating shows that relationships that move from text to in-person faster have better outcomes than those that stay in text limbo forever.



\# Step 6: Don't Double Text Out of Anxiety (But Don't Fear It Either)



The ""never double text"" rule is stupid. Sometimes he's just busy. Sometimes he didn't see it. Sometimes the conversation naturally ended and neither of you realized it.



If you have something genuinely interesting to say a few hours or a day later, send it. But here's the key: Don't double text because you're anxious about his silence. Double text because you have something worth saying.



Bad double text: ""Hey, did you see my last message?"" 

Good double text: ""Random thought, but have you ever been to that new taco place downtown?""



See the difference? One reeks of anxiety and neediness. The other shows you're living your life and just thought of something.



\*\*Podcast recommendation\*\*: Check out \*Where Should We Begin?\* by Esther Perel. She's a couples therapist who records real therapy sessions (anonymously) and breaks down relationship dynamics. Several episodes touch on communication patterns and why we get anxious when people don't text back. Mind-blowing stuff about how modern communication creates unnecessary anxiety.



\# Step 7: Use Voice Messages Strategically



Here's a secret weapon most people ignore: voice messages. Not for everything, but strategically placed voice messages can create way more connection than text.



Why? Because voice carries emotion, tone, personality. All the things that get lost in text. If you're explaining something that needs nuance or just want to share excitement about something, a 30 second voice message beats a paragraph of text.



But don't overuse them. If every message is voice, it becomes overwhelming. Use them when you want to create a moment of real connection or when text just isn't cutting it.



\# Step 8: Stop Analyzing Every Word He Sends



Real talk: You're probably overthinking this. ""He used a period instead of an exclamation point, does he hate me?"" No. He's just texting normally.



Guys generally don't read into subtext the way we do. If he's responding, if he's engaging, if he's asking questions back, then he's interested. Don't create problems that don't exist by overanalyzing punctuation and response times.



\*\*App recommendation\*\*: Finch is a habit building app that can help with anxiety and overthinking patterns. It's not specifically for dating, but building mental health habits helps you show up more confident and less anxious in all areas, including texting. The daily check-ins help you recognize when you're spiraling into overthinking mode.



\# Step 9: Match Interest, Not Effort



There's this idea that you need to match his texting style exactly. That's not quite right. What you need to match is interest level, not necessarily effort.



If he's clearly interested, engaged, asking questions, planning dates, but just happens to text short messages, that's fine. Don't interpret short texts as disinterest if everything else shows he's into you.



But if he's giving one-word answers, taking days to respond, never asking questions, that's low interest. And you can't text your way into making someone interested who isn't.



\# Step 10: Remember Texting Is Not the Relationship



This is the most important point. Texting is a tool, not the goal. The goal is actual human connection. If you're building something real with someone, the texting will naturally flow. If you're constantly stressed about texting, it might be a sign that the connection isn't as strong as you want it to be.



Stop trying to create chemistry through the perfect text. Chemistry happens in person. Texting just maintains it between meetings.



The guys who are genuinely interested will make it obvious. They'll respond, they'll engage, they'll want to see you. And the ones who aren't interested? No amount of perfect texting will change that. So stop stressing and start enjoying the process.",2,1771596753.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

You know the feeling sweaty palms, racing thoughts, then blurting out some nonsense about your “greatest weakness” being perfectionism. It’s not a competence issue. It’s a **performance issue**. And it’s way more common than it should be.

This post is the cheat code. It’s the stuff they *don’t* teach you in school, but what top performers, job coaches, and hiring managers all agree actually works. This is distilled from research, elite career books, recruiting podcasts, and inside scoop from real hiring panels. No fluff. Just tactics.

**1. Prepare like it’s a final exam, not a coffee chat**

Most people don’t prep enough. Don’t just read the company website. Actually *simulate* the interview. Record yourself. Time your answers. Use ChatGPT to mock-interview you based on the job description. The Muse found in a study that candidates who practiced out loud beforehand were rated **43% more favorably** by hiring managers. It’s never just about your resume. It’s how you **sell your story**.

**2. Use the “SAR” model to structure every answer**

Forget rambling. Use this structure: **Situation, Action, Result**. This comes from research by Harvard's Office of Career Services and is used by McKinsey, Google, and other top firms. Briefly describe the challenge, what you *did*, and what it *led to*. Clear, punchy storytelling beats generic “I’m a team player” fluff every time.

**3. Don't memorize answers. Memorize bullet points**

According to research published in the *Journal of Applied Psychology*, people who use keywords instead of full scripts **perform better** under pressure. Scripts sound robotic. Bullet points keep you flexible. Think: key points, not perfect lines.

**4. Master your “tell me about yourself” intro**

This is your opening pitch. If you fumble here, it sets the tone. Keep it under 90 seconds. Focus on your trajectory: where you started, what you’ve done, what you’re aiming for. Ramit Sethi calls this “your narrative arc” people remember *stories*, not lists.

**5. Mirror their energy, not their words**

Social psychology research by Tanya Chartrand shows “behavioral mimicry” boosts likability in interviews. Don’t copy what they *say*, but tune into how they talk. Fast or slow, formal or relaxed? Match the vibe. People unconsciously favor those who feel familiar.

**6. Ask better questions at the end**

Don’t ask basic stuff. Ask: “What has made people succeed in this role versus struggle?” or “How does your team define success in the first 90 days?” Research from Glassdoor shows that insightful questions increase perceived interest and preparation scores.

**7. Follow up like a pro**

Send a thank you email within 24 hours. Not generic. Reference *something specific* they said. A 2020 TopResume survey found that **68% of hiring managers** say a good follow up *positively* impacts their decision.

You’re not trying to be perfect. You’re trying to be **clear, confident, and human**. Let the over rehearsed candidates drown in buzzwords. Be sharp. Be prepared. Be real.",1,1771596715.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

I’m a 22-year-old final year [B.Tech](http://B.Tech) IT student in Pune. Into tech, literature, sci-fi, random existential spirals at 2am — the usual nerd package.

College is almost over, placements are happening, everyone’s talking about career growth and long-term plans… and I’m here wondering whether it’s even realistic to try building something meaningful as a gay guy in Pune.

Most of my straight friends are dating, in relationships, or at least meeting people organically. For me, most of my experiences through apps or meetups haven’t really been great. A lot of conversations feel surface-level. When I do meet someone, it often ends up being more of a one-night thing, and the spark just dies after that. No real connection, no depth, no “let’s actually get to know each other.”

I’m not judging anyone — I know people want different things. But personally, I’m looking for something more meaningful. Someone I can talk to about life, tech, movies, confusion about the future. Coffee dates. Random bike rides. Late-night conversations that don’t disappear the next day.

Sometimes it feels like:

* The queer dating scene here is either very hidden
* Or mostly hookup-focused
* Or I’m just bad at navigating it

So I’m genuinely asking:

* Is it normal to feel this way here?
* Is something meaningful actually possible in Pune?
* Where do people even meet other gay guys outside apps?

Would really appreciate honest perspectives or shared experiences. Just trying to figure out if I’m overthinking this or if this is just part of the phase.",2,1771596443.0,LGBTindia,5,1.0,False

1r9w7e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseMD/comments/1r9w7e7/imagining_a_chase_md_series_after_season_8/,Imagining a Chase M.D. series after Season 8,"Ever since the Season 8 finale, I've found myself wanting a Chase M.D. spin-off more than I expected. I kept thinking about where he'd go next, so I started imagining one myself. This is just my personal take, but I wanted to share it in case there are others out there who still wish we'd gotten to see him lead his own team. I've seen some people say that a Chase spin-off might just feel like a weaker version of House. But I don't see it that way. To me, it wouldn't be about repeating House's formula. It would be about seeing Chase in a different light. Not as a disciple, but as a leader. Not as someone reacting to House, but as someone defining himself.

At its heart, I imagine the series exploring what it truly means to inherit a legacy… After stepping into House’s former role, Chase faces more than just difficult cases... he faces the weight of expectation. Patients still ask for House. Colleagues compare. And beneath his calm exterior, Chase begins to question how much of his thinking is truly his own. Determined not to become “another House,” he sets out to prove that brilliance doesn’t require cruelty. Yet the harder he resists that comparison, the more he realizes how deeply House’s influence runs. The series would follow Chase as he struggles to draw the line between mentorship and identity. Learning, through exhaustion and doubt, how to lead in a way that is unmistakably his own.

At the start of the series, Chase is newly appointed as head of diagnostics, Chase carries himself with measured control. On paper, he is more than qualified. Experienced, disciplined, and respected. But the transition has been anything but effortless. The weight of House’s legacy lingers in every hallway, in every interview, in every comparison. Determined to lead differently, Chase makes a conscious effort to remain composed and fair. Yet beneath that restraint lies fatigue, both physical and psychological. He is still learning what authority feels like on his shoulders. And in quiet moments, he wonders whether his instincts are truly his own, or echoes of the man who trained him.

Rather than recreating House’s old team, I imagined Chase building something entirely new. A team that reflects both what he learned, and what he wants to move beyond. These are entirely original characters... I wanted to explore how Chase would choose differently from House.

**Doctor 1:** Female, mid-20s, Internal Medicine+Infectious Disease  
Brilliant and fast-thinking, she builds aggressive differentials and isn’t afraid to challenge authority. Coming from a working-class background, she has fought for every opportunity she’s had, and quietly questions whether Chase ever had to. She admires his position, but not his legacy. She pushes cases forward, but her impatience and early certainty often put her at odds with Chase’s more measured approach. In her, Chase sees his younger brilliance untempered, ambitious, and dangerously certain.

**Doctor 2:** Female, late 30s, Emergency Medicine  
A British physician who relocated to the U.S. after rebuilding her life post-divorce, she brings calm precision and emotional restraint to the team. A single mother with a long view of consequences, she prioritizes stability over ego. Unlike those who admire or challenge Chase, she simply sees him, recognizing both his brilliance and his fractures. She doesn’t romanticize chaos or compete for dominance; she steadies the room. And that quiet understanding unsettles Chase far more than confrontation ever could.

**Doctor 3:** Male, late 20s, Neurology  
A methodical and emotionally intelligent physician, he came to Princeton–Plainsboro specifically to work under Chase, not House. Analytical and collaborative by instinct, he believes authority should be earned, not imposed. Exceptionally strong in pattern recognition, he often sees the right answer early, but hesitates before claiming it. Where others challenge or scrutinize Chase, he offers steady trust. That quiet confidence both supports Chase and forces him to confront his own uncertainty. Over time, he may become the one person capable of telling Chase, calmly and without ego: “You’re wrong.”

And... another question I kept coming back to was Wilson’s absence.

For House, Wilson was more than a colleague, he was an emotional anchor, someone outside the hierarchy who could see him clearly. Chase, stepping into leadership, wouldn’t have that automatically. His team reports to him. Foreman outranks him. Authority complicates vulnerability. Leadership isolates. So I imagined the oncology office wouldn’t remain empty, not as a replacement for Wilson, but as a different kind of counterbalance.

**Head of Oncology:** Female, early 30s, Medical Oncologist.  
A composed and methodical physician who chose oncology deliberately, believing that steadiness around mortality is a form of strength. Controlled, perceptive, and allergic to emotional theatrics, she values competence over charisma. She doesn’t idolize Chase, nor does she compete with him. She questions him, quietly and precisely. Where others either challenge or admire him, she understands him. Not as a savior, and not as a project. Over time, she becomes a counterweight, someone who refuses to let him romanticize his own damage.

So here’s how I imagine the pilot beginning:  
The pilot opens with Chase entering the diagnostic office for the first official interview day as department head. The space feels too clean. Too deliberate. No longer House’s, but not fully his either. The red-and-gray ball remains on the desk, untouched at first.

Foreman arrives with a stack of pre-filtered candidates, immediately reminding Chase that leadership does not mean autonomy. Their brief exchange establishes the power structure: Chase runs Diagnostics, but Foreman still oversees him.

Left alone, Chase picks up the ball, not out of nostalgia, but habit. Then the first knock comes. The interviews begin. And with them, the quiet question that will define the series: is this department truly his, or is he still standing in someone else’s shadow?

During the interviews, one candidate stands out: sharp, confident, unafraid to question assumptions. She answers a familiar House-era question in an unexpectedly nuanced way, and notices something Chase himself missed. He hires her, recognizing both her brilliance and the risk that comes with it. (She is Doctor 1)

Later, in a small but telling moment, Chase mistakes the newly appointed head of oncology for one of his team members and casually asks her to bring him coffee. A subtle test of authority that reveals how new and uneasy this role still feels on him. The episode closes not with confrontation, but with quiet tension: Chase at the desk, the ball in his hand, aware that the department may bear his name, but not yet his identity.

I know Chase has already grown tremendously throughout Seasons 1-8. He isn’t the same doctor he once was. But stepping into House’s role isn’t a victory lap. It’s a new beginning. And new beginnings come with new fractures. So if a Chase M.D. series existed, I imagine it wouldn’t open with a spectacular medical triumph. It would open quietly, with adjustment, pressure, and the subtle discomfort of inhabiting a legacy that isn’t entirely his yet. Not a story about becoming House. But about becoming steady in a room that once belonged to him.",2,1771596245.0,HouseMD,2,0.75,False

Finally today the recommended resting time got over so I brewed a cup with v60 in the morning and aeropress in the evening. The v60 one needs dialing in, here is what I did:
1:15 ratio
18 clicks on timemore c2
92C water 
Bloom with triple the weight for 45s
Then two pours with quite some agitation via swirling.

Tasted a little bitter so need to dial back on the agitation. But apart from that the dark chocolate taste was quite prominent and I could make out the citric  acidity. Medium body but was lacking in clarity. 
Overall, still a pleasant cup.

With the aeropress tho I loved the cup:
Here is what I did:
Somewhat followed jonathan Gange's recipe with 18g coffee to 275 g water. Did some initial bloom and then added all the water ( 96C). Let steep and at 5 min again swirled, and then again at 8. Started pressing at 9 and finished at the 10 minute mark.

Tasted perfectly balanced, the  chocolatey, nutty note was right on the mark and the cup was very sweet, I could make out some citrus and apple crispiness and it had good body and still somewhat nice clarity. 

How was your experience? also drop the recipe if you figured the v60 out!

1r9w4ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/1r9w4ze/why_not_educate_and_incentive_new_yorkers_to_pick/,Why not educate and incentive New Yorkers to pick up after their dogs?,"There's been a lot of rhetoric about dog poop lately, including a poster in r/nyc who wanted to ban all new dog ownership.  This morning, Chi Osse and a Sanitation Department commissioner were on WNYC talking about it.  Osse said that rats love to eat dog waste, which was a lot to picture before I had coffee.

I had a dog in the City for ten years.  I knew it was the law to pick up after her, and I did, but no one from the City ever told me to.  Even when I adopted her from Animal Care & Control, I don't remember being given any information about pooper-scooper laws.  I did it because I grew up with dogs and that's the ways I was raised.  Picking it up is not fun, and sometimes you do need to carry it around for a while until you find a garbage can.

By contrast, I also used to have a car in the City.  Renewing my driver's license was a hassle involving applications and tests, and I learned that I could get a significant discount on my car insurance if I watched a ridiculous safety video from the '90s.  

Dog licenses cost $8.50 a year.  That's ALL.  It's one of the best deals in NYC, and renewing a license online takes, like, five minutes.  So here's my idea:  double the cost of a dog license.    Then tell applicants that they can get 50% off of the license for watching a ten-minute video about dog ownership laws.  Make sure that there's at least one scene of fat rats feasting on juicy turds.  Let's see how THAT changes behavior.",0,1771596087.0,AskNYC,23,0.41,False
1r9w4q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1r9w4q7/we_seriously_need_to_talk_about_fitness_habits_in/,We seriously need to talk about fitness habits in India,"I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and I feel like we don’t talk enough about basic fitness and diet habits in India.

When you compare us to many European countries or even some developing nations, a lot of Indians struggle with issues like belly fat, low muscle mass, low energy levels, and looking fatigued by their early 30s. I’m not saying this to insult anyone  it’s more about lifestyle patterns we’ve normalized.
The biggest problems I see:

Sedentary lifestyle
High sugar consumption (tea/coffee multiple times a day with sugar)
Excess oil in home-cooked food
Processed oils used in large quantities
Very little strength training
We actually have strong genetic potential. But we waste it with poor habits.
I’m NOT saying everyone needs to go into hyper gym mode or follow an athlete-level diet. That’s unrealistic.
I’m talking about small, basic changes:

1. Move your body.

Hit the gym if possible. If not, at least walk daily. Do something physical consistently.

2. Reduce oil.

Indian food doesn’t need to float in oil. Use less. Switch from heavily processed oils to better alternatives like coconut oil or olive oil (and use them moderately).

3. Cut down sugar.

You don’t have to quit junk food overnight. But at least stop direct sugar intake. Reduce sweets and cut down multiple cups of sugary tea/coffee daily. Even limiting it to once a day is progress.

4. Build some muscle.

A bit of strength training changes everything posture, metabolism, confidence.
You don’t need a dramatic transformation. Just follow these small habits consistently for 2 months. That’s it.

After 2 months, you’ll feel the difference  better energy, better mood, better appearance. And once you see results, you’ll naturally continue.

We don’t need extremes.

We just need discipline in small things.
Would love to hear what small habit changes worked for you.",3,1771596070.0,india,0,0.8,False

At the end of the call he asked me if I'd like to join him for coffee. I wanted to say yes but I'm recovering from typhoid (TMI sorry). 
We've talked about 8 hours over the course of 2 days (ADHD much?). I like how he doesn't say ""let's hang, or let's meet, and how he always says ""for our first date"". 
He has ADHD like me, basically we're super compatible on the phone. I want to see how that chemistry translates IRL. I told him I'm open to meet after 2-3 weeks once I feel better again. 

And I truly want to meet him. I'm just worried about how he'll think of me when we do meet. I know it's just me overthinking but I'm afraid he won't find me attractive if we meet. I have posted full body pics on hinge, and it's the very first pic so if anyone does match with me they're not blindsided but I'm just worried what if I don't meet with his expectations of me. 

He suggested going for coffee and I asked if we can make those lego flower thingies together and take that home as a small momento. Mostly because I think it's cute. He was all in. He liked the idea. And also said if I want him to plan something he will but if I want to choose something he'll be happy to follow along.

I guess I just wanted to know what you guys think?

1r9w37c,https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBYOC/comments/1r9w37c/celeste_mondros_the_blue_gaze_of_mantle/,"Celeste Mondros, The Blue Gaze of Mantle","Disclaimer: this was rewritten by chatgpt, though I did rewritten it again, so if you feel it was written by Ai, you're quarter correct on that.



**Name**: Celeste Mondros 

**Meaning**:
Celeste is a color of sky-pale blue,
With its meaning being divinity and ‘of the heavens’,

Mondros is a stylized polish name from Slavic roots that means wisdom, thought or reason 

In full, means ‘Mind Among the Heavens’

**Nickname/alias**: the Blue Gaze, ms. Eyes, Cel

**Gender**: female

**Age**: 17

**Orientation**: idk she hasn't found someone interesting like that 

**Race**: faunus (Red Tailed Hawk)

**Nationality**: Atlas

**Birthday**: July 7th

**Affiliate**: Atlas Academy 

**Occupation**: Huntress-in-Training (second year)

**Height**: 5’6” (167cm)

**Weight**: 162lbs

**Body Build**: fit, ectomorph

**Skin Tone**: slightly tanned white

**Eye Colour**: Light Cyan Blue

**Aura Colour**: Extremely Pale Blue

**Hair Colour**: Red nearing to crimson Hair

**Faunus Features**: Feathers in her calves and elbows

**Appearance**: 
Celeste looks like a typical pretty girl, usually dressed in loose, comfortable clothing that allows her to move freely. She has a slim build, though there’s subtle muscle definition in her forearms and calves from constant training. At a glance, there’s nothing particularly striking about her appearance.

Except for her eyes.

If you stare into them long enough, there’s something deeply unsettling about them — as if they’re focusing on something far beyond you. When she uses Steam Dust, faint cloud-like patterns can sometimes be seen swirling within her irises, like a certain blindfolded honored man.

While that unnerving intensity remains whenever Kaleidoscope is active, the color of her eyes does not. Instead, they shift to match the corresponding hue of the Dust she is using

**Weapon**: Judge-Men

Judge-Men is a three-foot sword-dagger hybrid with a thick grip and a large pommel. The handle and pommel are designed to store Dust, typically holding three vials of different types at once. Built-in chambers allow her to either coat the blade in Dust or inject it directly into a target through a stab wound. The weapon also acts as a conduit, helping her channel specific Dust types into Kaleidoscope more efficiently.

On standard missions, she typically carries Water, Fire, and Steam Dust vials on Judge-Men, with Electricity and Air dust vials in her pockets.

Fire Dust is used to superheat the blade, increasing cutting power. Steam Dust can be vented to propel her strikes faster, adding sudden bursts of acceleration. Water Dust helps regulate Kaleidoscope’s strain, extending its duration and reducing the risk of overheating during prolonged engagements.

**Semblance** – Kaleidoscope:

Kaleidoscope allows Celeste to near instantly analyze and calculate anything she sees, channeling Aura into her brain and eyes to simulate near five-second future sight at its base level. Because most of her Aura is concentrated in her head while it is active, the rest of her body becomes comparatively more  vulnerable physically.

It significantly enhances her processing speed, mental calculations, and overall cognition, drastically sharpening her reaction time and predictive ability. She can answer multiple test questions simultaneously—an advantage that led to her being banned from using her Semblance during her time at Atlas Academy. Dodging waves of bullets is routine for her, and she has defeated four third-year students at once during training.

By channeling more Aura into Kaleidoscope, she can extend her foresight up to fifteen seconds and increase her processing speed to roughly three times her normal capacity.

However, the Semblance has strict limits. Within any five-minute window, Celeste can only sustain Kaleidoscope for a total of sixty seconds. Increasing the output reduces that duration—at maximum intensity, she can maintain it for about twenty seconds before her eyes and brain overheat.

When overheating occurs, she becomes temporarily blind and suffers a sharp, lingering headache. Recovery can take anywhere from twenty seconds to five minutes, depending on how much Aura remained before overheating. Repeatedly forcing activation without proper cooldown can eventually push her into a coma lasting up to a week.

If she allows Kaleidoscope to cool down naturally instead of overheating it, she regains two seconds of usable time for every ten seconds that pass.

**Dust Interactions**:

On contact with Dust, each type affects Kaleidoscope differently, ranging from detrimental to extremely amplifying. She cannot use more than one type of Dust at a time.

Fire Dust: One of the worst types for her. It grants limited thermal/infrared vision but causes her to overheat three times faster. It is usually better used offensively rather than to enhance Kaleidoscope.

Water Dust: One of the best types for her. It extends Kaleidoscope’s maximum duration from sixty seconds up to five minutes, though it more commonly extends it to around two minutes and thirty seconds. The quality and size of the Dust determine the exact extension.

Electric Dust: Also among the best. It amplifies her future sight up to forty seconds and increases her processing speed by up to ten times. When combined with maximum Aura output, this can stack to roughly thirty times normal speed. However, it also increases her overheating rate by up to five times, depending on the Dust’s quality and quantity.

Wind Dust: Enhances Kaleidoscope’s perception of moisture, airflow, moving objects, and weather patterns, refining her environmental awareness.

Steam Dust: Extends Kaleidoscope’s duration by up to fifteen seconds, but offers little beyond that. She more often uses it to accelerate her physical strikes when she has excess Dust to burn.

Gravity Dust: Similar to Wind Dust in specialization, it enhances her perception and processing of velocity, trajectory, mass, energy, acceleration, Aura, and distance. However, her overall processing speed outside of those aspects is reduced by half.

Combustion Dust: Rather than simply enhancing or shortening Kaleidoscope, this compresses its full sixty seconds of use into a single instant. In exchange, it can extend her future sight up to one hour if fully cooled beforehand. However, doing so cripples her ability to use Kaleidoscope for at least a week. Unlike normal overheating, this does not cause blindness or headaches.

Ice Dust: Extends her duration before overheating up to thirty minutes, but reduces her future sight to only one second and limits her mental enhancement to a 50% increase. It is better suited for prolonged engagements. It also gives her a severe “brain freeze” sensation during use.

Hard-Light Dust: One of the worst types for her. It provides no enhancement and instead clogs her mental processing. It is better to just use it defensively rather than with Kaleidoscope.

Lava Dust: Also highly detrimental. It accelerates overheating exponentially and provides no thermal vision benefits like Fire Dust.
It is usually better used offensively rather than to enhance Kaleidoscope.

Plant Dust: Similar to Wind Dust in specialization. It enhances her perception of biological matter, including muscle movement, micro-expressions, emotions, and even Grimm physiology.

Rock Dust: Provides no noticeable effect on Kaleidoscope.
It is better to just use it defensively rather than with Kaleidoscope.

**Personal information**:
**Likes**:
Cinnamon, banana bread, coffee, and cold water,

**Dislikes**:
Loud sounds, snow, and wearing expensive clothing,

**Personality**:
Celeste is lax, calm, and collected outside of missions and fieldwork. She often spends her free time in the Atlas Academy library, studying combat forms to refine her stances and strategies. Despite her disciplined nature, she also enjoys lighter reading—particularly Mistrali slice-of-life novels and Vacuan novellas.

On missions, however, the shift is unsettling. She becomes precise and mechanical, moving and acting with calculated efficiency, finishing operations as quickly as possible while still ensuring the best possible outcome. There is little wasted motion, little visible emotion, and what little of it was shown was always intentional.

Atlas Academy has awarded Celeste Mondros ten Academy Honors, two Orders of Merit, and the Order of Highest Atlas Student Merit for “ending strife and ensuring the safety of the southern cluster of villages in Mantle.”

For every award she receives, she celebrates by buying herself at least two loaves of banana bread with jam and eating them alone.

Though she is a Faunus living in Atlas, Celeste holds little resentment toward the kingdom. Her life was not shaped by systemic discrimination so much as by isolated conflicts. In her early years, she frequently found herself targeted by local thugs—more out of intimidation and wounded pride than prejudice. After repeatedly defeating them, she unintentionally earned their respect. What began as hostility turned into an unusual promotion: they pushed her into a leadership role within their gang.

As time went on, Celeste trained them, having at her peak 13 gangs on her ‘leash’.

Her “leadership” was more akin to coaching a baseball team. She trained them, imposed discipline and etiquette, and encouraged them to redirect their aggression into something structured, often guiding them toward militia work, and in rare cases, helping a few qualify for Atlas Academy. It wasn’t a total change, but it was enough to steer them toward better paths.

Her official team, Team ASCA (Ascalon: Ash, Sea, Celeste, and Aerolen), while highly capable, they're notoriously prone to distractions. They have a habit of picking up “side quests” mid-mission like helping remote settlements, clearing out additional Grimm nests, or resolving local disputes. As a result, they are often late returning to Atlas by weeks, sometimes even two months.

When they finally return home, however, it is usually to receive honors and awards for work that far exceeded their original assignment.

**Backstory**:
Celeste’s upbringing was, by Atlas standards, comfortable. She was born into the middle–upper echelon of society and never knew hunger or financial insecurity. Her life was structured, stable, and quite honestly nice.

Her father was a biologist specializing in agricultural sciences. Rather than working in a distant facility, he conducted most of his research at home, maintaining a small hydroponic farm in their basement. Celeste often watched him work. To an outsider, the plants looked nearly identical, rows of greens grown under artificial light, but the differences were in nutritional optimization, yield efficiency, and growth timing.

He once explained to her that while Plant Dust could dramatically accelerate growth, it was far too expensive for large-scale agricultural use. His research focused on reducing reliance on Dust while maintaining high output and low maintenance costs. By the time Celeste was fourteen, his methods were officially integrated into rural supply systems, particularly in villages and towns that struggled with transportation access.

Her mother, in contrast, was a freelance Huntress. She was often gone for weeks at a time on missions, but when she returned, she spoiled both her husband and daughter, cooking elaborate meals and baking exceptionally good banana bread.

Banana bread remains Celeste’s favorite to this day.

She learned how to make it from her mother. Once, she burned her finger slightly while trying to pull a pan out too quickly. It didn't really scar her finger but she still remembers it.

1r9w1q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wegovy/comments/1r9w1q4/wegovy_two_days_in/,"Wegovy, Two Days In","Had my first Wegovy injection (.25 mg) Wednesday evening 2/18. So this is really day 1.5. My observations:

It worked FAST. Woke up Thursday morning with no side effects at all. Ate a banana for breakfast and drank a cup of coffee, felt full immediately (not stuffed, but satisfied). NO food noise during the day. I had to remember to eat lunch, which was a 5 oz chicken thigh and a spinach salad. I couldn’t finish the salad. 

Dinner was “road food,” since I’m traveling right now: A turkey/bacon wrap from Wawa and a bottle of water. Was able to finish the wrap, but felt no desire to eat anything else the rest of the day/evening. Enjoyed a glass of wine at the hotel bar, no ill effects. Went to bed, slept like a log.

This morning: Still no side effects, apart from a persistent stomach gurgle and a vague sense of fullness. No nausea or anything else. Ate an egg bake with tomato, basil, and spinach and a small fruit bowl for breakfast, along with coffee. There was toast on the plate, but I got through half of one slice before I had to stop. Sitting in my hotel room now feeling full and only thinking about food because I’m typing about it. Zero food noise. It’s amazing. I had no idea what life was like without it.

Since the injection, I’ve also been experiencing an odd sense of calm. My overall mood has improved. I’m no longer getting irritated at little things, and I’m finding I have more mental clarity. That could just be because I’m not being pulled away by food all the time, but I thought I’d mention it because it wasn’t something I was expecting. That said, I like it. I hope it continues.

Sometimes I just... don't feel like explaining something right now? Like maybe it's a long story and I'm tired. Maybe I need to process it first. Maybe I'm currently holding coffee and can't gesture properly to tell it right.

But now if you say ""I'll tell you later,"" people either think you're being shady or they're bracing for major drama. There's no in-between.

I want to reclaim ""I'll tell you later"" for boring reasons. For ""this story needs context I don't feel like providing right now"" reasons. For ""I'm not in storytelling mode"" reasons.

She doesn't know it's me. Should I keep it anonymous or tell her?,"It started two weeks ago. She sits two desks away. I noticed the pattern before I even realized I was noticing. On days her calendar was back to back, she'd just not eat. Keep typing. Keep taking calls. At 4pm she'd grab a coffee like that was supposed to count.

First time was half accidental. Had an extra granola bar. Put it on her desk before she got in.

She found it mid morning and said out loud to nobody, ""oh my god, where did this come from?""

Ate it in like 45 seconds. So I kept going, nothing big. A tangerine. Small pack of nuts. Once, on a brutal looking Thursday, a proper sandwich.

She's mentioned it to people. I've heard her say ""I have a desk fairy"" with this genuinely delighted laugh. Told someone it makes her feel looked after on hard days.

She has no idea. I'm not telling her because I don't want it to become a thing. Don't want her to feel obligated. Don't want to turn a small quiet kindness into a whole conversation about it.

But lately I wonder if she'd actually love to know. If knowing would give her something different than the not knowing does.

A. Stay anonymous. The ""desk fairy"" makes her smile. Some kindness lands differently when it has no face. Let it stay magic.

B. Tell her. Not to get credit. But because she might want to know there's a real person who notices when she doesn't eat. That might mean more than the granola bar.",14,1771595373.0,PickAorB,14,0.94,False

1r9vs8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1r9vs8h/i_stopped_feeding_my_brain_garbage_before_9am/,I stopped feeding my brain garbage before 9am. Here's what happened.,"For years, my morning looked like this:

Alarm goes off. Eyes still closed. Hand reaches for phone. Scroll Instagram. Check email. Skim the news. Read a few texts. Maybe watch a random video someone sent me.

By the time I actually got out of bed, I'd already consumed 30 minutes of other people's problems, opinions, and highlight reels. And I hadn't even brushed my teeth yet.

I didn't think much of it. Everyone does this, right? It's just how mornings work now.

Then I had a week where everything felt harder than it should. I was irritable by noon. I couldn't focus on deep work. I felt behind before I even started. And I noticed something: the days I scrolled hardest in the morning were the days I crashed hardest by afternoon.

So I tried an experiment. For 30 days, no screens before 9am. No exceptions.

The first week was rough.

I didn't realize how automatic the phone grab was. I'd wake up and my hand would literally reach for it before my eyes opened. The first few days, I felt restless. Bored. Like something was missing.

But by week two, something shifted.

I started noticing my own thoughts.

Without the constant input, my brain had space to actually think. Ideas surfaced. I remembered things I needed to do. I felt more present making coffee, more aware of how I actually felt that morning. It sounds dramatic, but I hadn't had that kind of quiet in years.

My focus lasted longer.

This was the biggest change. I used to hit a wall around 11am where my brain just... stopped cooperating. Deep work felt impossible. But when I protected my morning from the scroll, I could sustain focus well into the afternoon. It was like I'd been starting each day with a depleted battery and didn't know it.

I stopped feeling behind.

When you wake up and immediately see 47 emails, 12 notifications, and news about some crisis somewhere, your nervous system kicks into reactive mode. You're playing defense before you've even started. Without that input, I got to set my own agenda. I felt ahead instead of behind.

What I do now instead:

I'm not militant about it, but I try to keep the first hour screen-free. I drink water. I sit with coffee for a few minutes without doing anything. Sometimes I stretch or go outside briefly. I eat breakfast without watching something.

It's not a fancy routine. It's more like... giving my brain a buffer before the chaos starts.

The reframe that helped:

I started thinking of my morning attention like a clean glass of water. Every piece of content I consume before I'm fully awake is like dropping something into that glass. News? Drop of mud. Social media? Drop of dye. Random notifications? More sediment. By 9am, the water is murky before I've done anything meaningful with it.

Now I protect the glass. I let it stay clear until I've had a chance to use that clarity for something that actually matters to me.

I'm not saying screens are evil or that you need to become a monk. But if you're feeling scattered, anxious, or mentally exhausted by midday, look at what you're feeding your brain before it's even fully online.

The junk you consume first thing sets the tone for everything after.

What does your first hour look like? Have you experimented with protecting your mornings?",3,1771595187.0,Beingabetterperson,0,1.0,False

1r9vlgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductProbe/comments/1r9vlgn/my_thoughts_on_leverpresso_v4/,My thoughts on Leverpresso V4,"I took the Leverpresso V4 camping with me a few times this season, and it completely changed my expectations for “camp coffee.” I’ve done the usual French press and pour over at campsites, but being able to pull an actual espresso shot in the middle of nowhere feels a little ridiculous, in a good way.

See it here: [https://www.amazon.com/LEVERPRESSO-Portable-Ridgeless-Portafilter-pressurized/dp/B0CRYN5LWY/](https://www.amazon.com/LEVERPRESSO-Portable-Ridgeless-Portafilter-pressurized/dp/B0CRYN5LWY?th=1&linkCode=ll2&tag=r-productprobe-20&linkId=1ea9557a8c56c722a0552748565bc93e&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)

The V4 feels solid enough to trust outdoors. It’s not metal like some higher end lever machines, but the updated high impact body doesn’t feel flimsy. I was a bit cautious the first couple of pulls, especially without a pressure gauge, but once you get a feel for the resistance, muscle memory kicks in. After a few shots, I stopped thinking about pressure numbers and just focused on flow and timing.

The two lever system is surprisingly comfortable to use on a picnic table or even on a tailgate. You still need to lean into it to build pressure, but it’s smooth and controlled, not jerky. Paired with a decent hand grinder and a small kettle on a camp stove, I was getting rich, syrupy shots with real crema, which honestly felt borderline luxurious for a campsite.

It’s not perfect. The plastic tamper is pretty underwhelming, and I ended up bringing a better 51 mm tamper along. The rubber heat caps also got in my way more than they helped, so I mostly left them off. Still, for something that fits in a small bag and doesn’t need electricity, the V4 hits a sweet spot. If you care about espresso and want to travel light, it’s a seriously fun piece of gear to bring along.",3,1771594719.0,ProductProbe,0,1.0,False

1r9vhwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffeejp/comments/1r9vhwu/nel_drip/,Nel drip,"I really don't understand what's so special about nel drip coffee. It seems like it uses an extremely large amount of beans (45g) for a pretty terrible cup of coffee, in my personal opinion. I followed the below Daibō recipe exactly, from weights to timing to water temp, and used very good beans from Devición. The same beans brewed via my Aeropress (16.5g). I'm curious about other people's experiences and if they have any tips they'd recommend or should I just give up? Thanks y'all.

—

\*\*How to Nel Drip the Daibō Way\*\*  

\\-Firstly, if the flannel (also known as a nel) is new, remove it from the wire frame and boil it for 5 to 10 minutes then carefully remove it. Brush the flannel with a soft bristle brush on both inside and outside. Skip this step if you are using a previously-used nel.  

  

\\-Pinch the bottom of the nel and twist to wring out excess water. Place the nel between a clean dish towel and slap the towel to remove additional water.  

  

\\-Grind approximately 40 to 50 grams of coffee to a very course grind. Add coffee to nel in a very loose mound making sure the seams of the nel are on the outside.  

  

\\-Use a thin, flat utensil (like a pancake spatula) to ""groom"" the coffee. Slide the utensil to the bottom of the ground coffee, and in a up and down motion, loosen the coffee ground to add air between the nel and the ground beans. Once a full rotation has been made, use the utensil to make a divot on the top of the coffee mound.  

  

\\-Place cup or carafe on a scale and tare. Hold the nel over the cup without making contact with the receptacle.  

\*TIP: In order to keep the coffee temperature consistent, heat the cup prior to dripping. Some famous nel brewers reheat the coffee in a copper cup over a burner.\*

1r9vgo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/atomichabit/comments/1r9vgo7/i_forced_myself_to_be_bored_for_60_days_and_it/,I forced myself to be bored for 60 days and it completely rewired my brain,"I realized I hadn’t been genuinely bored in over five years.

Every single second of potential boredom had an instant solution. Waiting in line, pull out phone. Sitting on the toilet, scroll TikTok. Eating alone, watch YouTube. Lying in bed, browse Reddit. I’d engineered my entire life so boredom was impossible.

I’m 27. For the past five years I’d been filling every gap in my day with stimulation. Not because I wanted to consume all that content, but because I couldn’t handle the feeling of having nothing to do.

Standing in line at the grocery store for three minutes felt unbearable without my phone. Sitting in a waiting room felt like torture. Any moment where I wasn’t actively doing something, my hand automatically reached for my phone to fill the void.

I thought I was just being efficient with my time. Turns out I’d completely destroyed my brain’s ability to handle boredom and it was ruining everything.

My creativity was dead. I hadn’t had an original thought in years because my brain never had space to wander. My attention span was destroyed. I couldn’t focus on anything difficult because the second it got hard or boring, I’d escape to my phone.

I couldn’t sit through a movie without scrolling. Couldn’t have a conversation without checking notifications. Couldn’t read a book for more than five minutes. My brain had been trained that boredom was an emergency that needed immediate solving.

Two months ago I was sitting in a doctor’s waiting room scrolling Instagram and I realized I’d been there for 20 minutes and couldn’t remember a single post I’d seen. Just mindless scrolling to avoid sitting there with nothing to do.

That’s when it hit me. I was terrified of boredom. And that fear was preventing me from ever thinking deeply, being creative, or being present. I needed to relearn how to be bored.

What I actually did

Removed every boredom escape

Day one I deleted everything I used to avoid boredom. Every social media app, every mobile game, YouTube, Reddit, news apps, all of it gone.

Put my phone on grayscale so even looking at it was less appealing. Removed it from my bedroom so I couldn’t scroll in bed.

Found this app called Reload through some productivity forum. Used it to block all entertainment sites and social media on my laptop and phone. Also blocked the App Store so I couldn’t reinstall my boredom killers.

The goal was simple: make avoiding boredom impossible so I had to sit with it.

Forced boring situations daily

The plan Reload built required me to put myself in boring situations every single day and just sit with it. No phone, no distractions, just boredom.

Week one: sit in a park for 20 minutes doing absolutely nothing. No book, no phone, just sitting.

Week two: take a 30 minute walk with no music, no podcast, nothing. Just walking and being bored.

Week three and beyond: increase the boredom exposure until my brain could handle it.

Removed all background stimulation

I’d been filling every activity with secondary stimulation. Listening to podcasts while cooking. Watching YouTube while eating. Music during every car ride.

Removed all of it. Everything I did, I did with zero entertainment. Cooking in silence. Eating with no screen. Driving with no audio. Pure boredom during every formerly distracted moment.

Banned phone use in certain situations

No phone while waiting for anything. Waiting in line, waiting rooms, waiting for food, whatever. Just stand there and be bored.

No phone during meals ever. Just eat and be bored.

No phone in bed at all. If I couldn’t sleep I had to lie there bored, not scroll.

These rules made avoiding boredom impossible. I had to face it constantly.

Week 1 boredom felt like dying

First week was absolutely brutal. My brain went into panic mode every time it got bored.

Day 1 I sat in a park for 20 minutes doing nothing. Made it maybe 4 minutes before the restlessness became overwhelming. My brain was screaming for stimulation. Checked my watch every 30 seconds. Those 20 minutes felt like hours.

Day 2 I waited in line at the coffee shop without my phone. Three minute wait felt eternal. My hand kept reaching for my pocket out of habit. Had to physically keep my arms at my sides to stop myself.

Day 3 I ate lunch with no phone or TV. Just me and food. Felt so uncomfortable I almost couldn’t finish eating. My brain didn’t know what to do with the boredom.

Day 5 I tried to take a 30 minute walk with no podcast. Made it 10 minutes before I almost turned back. The silence and boredom felt unbearable. Forced myself to finish.

Day 7 I sat in a waiting room for 15 minutes with no phone. Looked around at everyone else scrolling. Felt like the only person not solving the boredom problem. Those 15 minutes felt longer than the entire day.

Week one I realized how dependent I’d become on constant stimulation. Couldn’t handle even a few minutes of boredom without genuine distress.

Week 2 to 3 my brain started adjusting

Weeks two and three the constant boredom exposure started changing something.

Day 10 I sat in the park for 25 minutes. Still uncomfortable but I didn’t check my watch every 30 seconds. My brain was slowly accepting that boredom wasn’t an emergency.

Day 12 I took a 40 minute walk with no audio. My mind started wandering instead of just panicking about the boredom. Had actual thoughts instead of just craving stimulation.

Week three I increased the boredom exposure. 30 minutes sitting doing nothing. Hour long walks. Entire meals in silence. My brain fought it less each time.

Day 18 I had my first original idea in probably two years. Was walking in silence and my mind wandered to a problem I’d been stuck on and suddenly I saw the solution. Would’ve never happened if I’d been listening to a podcast.

Day 21 I waited 10 minutes in line and didn’t even think about my phone. Just stood there. The boredom was present but not unbearable. My brain had started accepting it.

Week 4 to 6 boredom became productive

Weeks four through six something shifted completely. Boredom stopped feeling like torture and started feeling like space.

Day 25 I sat doing nothing for 45 minutes and my mind went to interesting places. Thought through a career decision I’d been avoiding. Planned out a project I wanted to start. My brain was using the boredom productively instead of panicking.

Day 30 I took an hour walk with no audio and came back with three pages of notes. My mind had wandered through problems, ideas, creative thoughts. All because I gave it space to be bored.

Week five the boredom became something I looked forward to. Those moments of nothing became when my best thinking happened.

Day 35 I was waiting 20 minutes for an appointment and just sat there thinking. Didn’t feel restless or uncomfortable. The boredom felt natural and my brain filled it with useful thoughts instead of panic.

Week six I was sitting doing nothing for an hour daily. Not meditating, just being bored and letting my mind wander wherever it wanted. That hour became the most valuable part of my day.

Day 42 I had more creative ideas in one week than I’d had in the previous year. My brain finally had space to think instead of just consuming.

Week 7 to 8 complete transformation

Last two weeks my relationship with boredom completely changed.

Day 50 I sat for 90 minutes doing absolutely nothing and it felt easy. My mind wandered through thoughts, solved problems, created ideas. The boredom was productive.

Week eight I could sit in any boring situation without reaching for my phone. Waiting rooms, lines, whatever. Just stood there comfortable with the boredom.

I was taking two hour walks with no audio and loving it. My mind would work through things, connect ideas, be creative. All because I gave it space to be bored.

Day 60 I realized I could focus on difficult tasks for hours. When the work got boring or hard, I didn’t immediately escape to my phone. I could sit with the difficulty because my brain could handle boredom now.

What actually changed in 60 days

My creativity came back

Hadn’t had original ideas in years because my brain never had space to wander. Two months of forced boredom and ideas were flowing constantly.

My attention span recovered completely

Could focus on difficult tasks for hours without needing stimulation. Could read books, watch movies, have conversations, all without reaching for my phone.

My problem solving improved dramatically

Best solutions came during bored moments when my mind could wander. Walking with no podcast, sitting doing nothing, that’s when breakthrough thoughts happened.

I became present in my life

Stopped filling every moment with consumption. Actually experienced moments instead of distracting through them.

I stopped fearing empty time

Boredom went from feeling like an emergency to feeling like valuable space. I actively sought it out instead of avoiding it.

My mental clarity improved massively

Constant stimulation had created constant mental noise. Boredom created space for clear thinking.

What I learned about boredom

Modern life has made boredom feel unbearable. We’re trained to solve it immediately with our phones.

Your brain needs boredom to function properly. Creativity, deep thinking, problem solving, all of it requires mental space that boredom provides.

Constant stimulation destroys your ability to focus. Your brain gets addicted to novelty and can’t handle anything difficult or boring.

The moments you’re most desperate to escape boredom are often when your brain would do its best thinking if you let it.

You can’t think deeply while constantly consuming other people’s thoughts. You need empty space for your own thoughts to emerge.

Boredom is a skill. Modern people have lost it completely because they’ve never had to develop it.

If you can’t handle being bored

Notice when you reach for your phone to escape boredom. What situation triggered it? Waiting, silence, lack of stimulation?

Delete your boredom escape apps for one week. Social media, mobile games, news apps, whatever you use to avoid boredom.

Force yourself into boring situations daily. Sit somewhere for 15 minutes doing nothing. Walk for 30 minutes with no audio. Just be bored.

Use tools that prevent escaping. I used Reload to block everything and make avoiding boredom impossible. When you can’t escape you’re forced to adjust.

Remove background entertainment from activities. Cook in silence. Eat without screens. Drive without podcasts. Experience the boredom.

Give it 30 days minimum. First week is brutal. Week two you adjust. Week four boredom becomes productive.

Let your mind wander during boredom instead of fighting it. That’s when the best thinking happens.

Final thought

I spent five years avoiding boredom every single second. Couldn’t sit in silence for three minutes without reaching for my phone.

Spent 60 days forcing myself to be bored constantly and my brain completely transformed.

Turns out boredom isn’t the enemy. It’s necessary. My creativity, focus, and clarity all came back when I stopped filling every moment with stimulation.

You’re probably avoiding boredom constantly too. Reaching for your phone the second you feel unstimulated. Filling every silence with content.

Stop escaping. Sit with the boredom. Let your brain have space to actually think.

The version of you that can handle boredom is more creative, focused, and present than the version constantly stimulated.

1r9vf6n,https://i.redd.it/81w1f0vcjnkg1.jpeg,One year of Morning pages.,"Yesterday marked one year since I began writing morning pages!
Like many of you, I became aware of it while reading The Artists Way.

The book encouraged writing 3 stream of consciousness pages not long after waking as a kind of brain drain exercise to clear the noise and make space.

I only made it about 2 weeks into the book before life got in the way. Illness, responsibilities, limitations, grief. So I actually put the book on hiatus and told myself that was okay. I could always come back to it, And even though I paused the book, I didn’t stop writing.

I continued to pick up my pen because I needed a place to turn to. I couldn’t keep so many thoughts jumbled up in my head anymore, so I gave them to paper. These pages held my fears. They listened when no one else was awake. They let me complain, spiral, repeat myself, soften, harden and soften again. They listened to half formed TV, movie and book thoughts, captured lyrics that got stuck in my head, and held a huge amount of grief. Some pages are stained with tears, wet sleeves, and coffee spills but that just adds character. 

They allowed me to be angry and vulnerable, but they also gave me so much joy and a years worth of memories. There was no pressure. I didn’t have to worry about spelling, grammar, or how my handwriting looked. These pages were just for me, and they helped me understand myself so much more. 
There were days I wrote nonsense, days I wrote anger, and days when I felt like I had nothing useful to say at all. Still, I came back every morning. 

I also haven’t read them back and I probably won’t for a very long time. Most of it is mundane, repetitive, and utter nonsense, but I guess that’s kind of the point? 

Occasionally a small gem appears, like that moment last year when I became fascinated with the adybirds in my garden. But I don’t go back to analyse or revisit the writing. The only time I really flip through the pages is when I need to remind myself what I did on a particular day, usually to help fill in my other journals.

For me, the pages aren’t for looking back. They’re for putting things down. 

Thank you to the version of me who kept going even when it felt pointless. Thank you for choosing consistentcy over perfection.

Perfectionism has held me back for most of my life. I would spend hours on something, decide I didn’t like it or that my writing looked ugly, rip it out, and start again and would end up with nothing to show.
To the outside world, it probably looked like I didn’t even bother. The truth is, I was so exhausted by perfectionism that I could never improve. It wasnt until I was almost 30 that I realised mistakes and allowing ourselves to be bad, to be beginners is literally how we grow. 

Writing used to feel impossible. Now, it’s become who I am. You’ll never see me without a notebook 😂 

Morning pages gave me quieter mornings and companionship with myself. 
I’m proud of myself.

Thank you notebooks , for listening to the rambles of an overwhelmed ADHD’er, You’ve been a real friend!   

P.S If I ever loose these notebooks, please know they were never meant to be read. Side effects include confusion and secondhand depression.

In a word salad tirade, President Donald Trump declared victory over the country’s cost of living battle on Tuesday, telling the crowd at an event in Georgia, “I’ve won affordability.”

This comes after a January CPI that highlighted: 

- Electricity prices are up 6.3%
- Natural gas services have increased 9.8%.
- Coffee is up 18.3% 
- Ground beef rose 17.2% over the year. 
- Baked goods and pantry items were also on the rise, with the price of breakfast cereal up over 6% since January 2025.

These remarks came on the President's ""affordability tour."" This tour comes as strange since the president has previously raged over the word “affordability,” calling it a Democratic “con job” at a December Cabinet meeting.

The president ended the Tuesday meeting with this comment:

> “I don’t wanna hear about the affordability because right now, we’re much less,” said Trump.

* Done the normal truck chores.  Trash runs, etc.
* Carried a bunch of brush from recent ice storms out to the burn pit.
* Carried a big-ass load of firewood cut from said storm damage, through mud and muck no 2WD would have managed.
* Brought home a huge load of lumber and supplies for an upcoming project.
* Said project will need power and a work surface where neither exist...Sherlock Ohms shall provide.
* Carried my golf clubs *in the frunk* to a few rounds (once starting a conversation and a chance to brag when another player saw the hood pop open).  The frunk is life.
* And to end the week, lost power at 2:30 am this morning, truck happily powered everything we needed, meaning we had refrigeration, microwave, internet, and *coffee* for the 4-hour outage, and I don't think the range noticed.  *lol*

Not only is this thing a fine truck for doing truck things, not only does it do most of them easier, more comfortably, and cheaper than anything else, but it also just *keeps finding ways* to be a useful tool for almost any situation.

Latest viewing promised professional setup. Showed up and half the desks were empty with previous tenant's junk still there. Reception area had boxes stacked everywhere.  
My current apartment lease ends in three weeks. Can't work from home long term because kids make client calls impossible. Can't keep using hotel lobbies and coffee shops for meetings. Everything feels stuck.  
  
People keep saying just pick something and move on but I'm signing a 12 month contract. Feels like I should be able to find proper workspace without settling for garbage.  
Starting to think I should've stayed in my home country where I knew which areas and buildings were actually good. The opportunity here is real but finding basic office space shouldn't be this hard.

1r9v17p,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1r9v17p/insomnia_my_journey_so_far/,Insomnia - My Journey so far,"Hi everyone, its my first post here but I am writing this today in the hope that some of the tricks and tips will help those who are stuck and looking for solutions. I know how horrible insomnia is and what it does to you over time. If you have any questions you can message me.

**Background**

My insomnia started in June 2025 after stressful time at work, lack of support at the time and some issues at home. I am nearly 40 year old male and have always had a moderate level of anxiety since i was a teen I think happened because of bullying at school even by teachers and strict parents who tried to control most aspects of my life. This held me back in so many ways and i only realised much later how it has affected my personal growth and led to anger issues and anxiety within. 

**Insomnia effects on me**

Everyone is different lack of sleep deprivation for me caused the following

* Diziness when standing up. 
* Headaches when waking up (I remedy this by washing my head with warm water and it fixes it for a few hours but it comes back anyway)
* Confusion and memory issues (Worse because i work in a demanding mental role, a task that takes 1 day to complete would take me 2 days and i would make mistakes everytime, even a teams meeting was a struggle for me)
* Anger and irritability in general (Linked to my lack of productivity and frustration)

Insomnia won't kill you straight away but it will cause sustained damage over time....Its not a nuclear bomb but it is like many tiny bombs going off at the same time over and over every night. 

**What i tried**  

Every supplement you can think of from apigenin, lemon balm, california poppy tinctures, magnesium, B vitamins, mirtazapine, ambien blah blah..... easily spent hundreds pounds on things. I tried EFT, EMDR and they sort of helped but not a permanent fix. 

I didn't want to give up, my GP doctor prescribed 15mg mirtazapine, first day i took 7mg by cutting the pill, it knocked me out and made me super groggy and useless for 2 days in a row. Even 2mg gave me the worst side effects, ambien on the other hand only worked sometimes, everything else mostly stopped working after a week and caused cross interactions . 

I was losing hope and wanted to quit my job but i have a kid and a mortgage to pay. UK doctors just don't get how bad insomnia is and what it can do to you they think antidepressants are the way forward but most are clueless so don't offer good solutions and over worked by the NHS.

**Hours of research and solving the puzzle**

Many years ago i did a 23 and me DNA test which gave me the raw genetic data file, I managed to locate my file and i uploaded the data into genetic genie and it did an analysis and highlighted some dodgy genes in red on a pdf. I uploaded these pdfs into chat gpt which then told me why certain medications didnt work for me and what was causing issues. Simply put some medications will work better than others for you but instead of doing things at random and trying millions of supplements its quicker and logical to use AI to give you better suggestions. Based on my genes chat GPT suggested I avoid high histamine diets and limit my supplement intake to just a few like L theanine, Magnesium and Taurine in the evenings. It also suggested i try Quvivq which is a new generation medication with less side effects. 

I put everything i learnt into practice a month ago and the results have been really promising. 

**What has worked and may help** 

* **My body is stuck in hyperarousal, I just would not fall sleepy until 2 or 3am even then it was like a mild onset** **and i would wake up after an hour or two** \- The fix for this is 3 things - Take time off work and break the routine if you can, a week or a month is even better because we need to move away from the stress and give the body a chance to recover. Mindfulness 5 to 10 mins a day and practice deep inhale and exhales. I also recommend putting some time aside to day dream, yes it sounds like a joke but day dreaming is exactly what we need to do for a few minutes everyday to come out of this loop and reduce the serious thoughts.
* **Anxiety paired with racing thoughts and rapid heart beat** \- You need to fix the anxiety first as this is exactly what stops the sleep onset- What helped me was full spectrum CBD oil (10%) tincture. I put 3 drops on my tongue and it just works calm the nervous system paired with L theanine and magnesium theoronate. You also need to convince your body that there is no threat and move away from toxic people or situations that induce anxiety. Trust me when i say you really need to fix the anxiety first otherwise your nervous system will remain charged and hyperarousal will not turn itself off. The CBD oil i only took maybe twice a week or if i really felt anxious. 
* **Stay away from caffeine -** Yes i loved strong coffee but this shit keeps you wired for hours and its bad for the nervous system if you have insomnia, I just drank chicory coffee which tastes the same and has zero caffeine.
* **Exercise -** It provides a massive boost for your mood and body better than any supplement can give you, even on my worst days  I do dumbells and kettlebells 30 mins every other day, its the best thing better than any drug and its free. 
* **Sunlight -** Go outdoors and face the sun for 10mins, yes you have heard it many times but for me it helps. 
* **CBT and talk therapy** \- I didn't do CBT or therapy but I know some other people who suffered from insomnia have benefitted from this massively, just venting out once a week will really help bringing down the anxiety levels. 

I also recommend eating unprocessed food, again a no brainer as the gut and brain are linked and if you have shitty genes then you really need to look after yourself. 

* **Medication** \- For me I only take medication maybe 2 or 3 times a week now to induce sleepiness, I take 50mg Quviviq before eating and wait 15 mins before dinner. It makes me drowsy after an hour or two. Do bear in mind that if you are anxious or keep having racing thoughts you need to fix them first before taking any sort of hynotic medication otherwise nothing will work. Meds also build tolerance if taken everyday so you really need to limit it to 3 times a week, again its just my experience but some people take meds everyday and it works for them everybody is different. 

**So far**

Sleep onset is mostly fixed which was my biggest issue, I fall asleep by 10pm and on off days when i feel a bit wired, I do not panic, just sit on the sofa downstairs and watch a movie. sleep is something we can't control so do not try to force it all the stories I read about bed time routines and sleep hygiene which i tried implementing simply do not cause you to fall asleep. They might however work for mild cases of insomnia i would guess. 

I have been waking up after 5 hours of sleep around 4am every day, this does get fixed eventually but will take time from what i have read. When this happens I just watch a tv show on my phone or meditate before the sleepiness returns and i doze off again for a couple of hours. On days I have slept for 4 hours or less its bad the next day but those days are a lot less common now. 

Going from 2 or 3 hours everyday to 5 to 6 hours of sleep for me is a big win. Please do give this method a try, there is so much data and help out there, now with tools such as AI its even better in terms of finding solutions. Fixing insomnia takes a bit of time and patience... Never give up and keep believing in yourself. ",3,1771593254.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

# A note so this doesn’t read like I’m “telling you everything up front”

This is not the full story of me, it’s simply a clear starting map. You’ll still have plenty to discover, because chemistry, our backgrounds and history, humor, conflict style, and the private little ways two people become a “we” can only be learned in real conversation over time. This is just enough map for you to see whether you’d like to take the adventure; the rest only unfolds in real time, together.

If you’re steady and emotionally mature, I’m not asking you to carry me or impress me. I’m looking for mutual ease: two adults choosing each other slowly, with warmth, humor, and consent.

⸻⸻⸻

# A soft pre-introduction

This is not a quick swipe profile. It is closer to a long letter of hope. I care very much about the kind of life and partnership I am hoping to build, so I chose to write it out fully instead of trying to fit it into a few clever lines.

It is long on purpose. You do not have to read it all in one sitting. Make a cup of coffee or tea, put on some soft music (I picked us a playlist), grab a warm blanket if you like, and take your time. Come back to it if you need to. If you enjoy piano, you are welcome to use the same kind of music I have in the background while I write and reread this. A quiet Chopin playlist like this one \\\[Chopin’s Nocturnes – link attached\\\] in the background can be a gentle companion while you move through it. There is no pressure at all to listen. I simply like the thought that somewhere out there, you might be reading this with the same music in your ears that I have in mind for you. If you resonate with this, something in you may start to recognize yourself as you move through it.

I know this will not be for everyone, and that is completely okay. I’m not trying to speak to everyone. I’m speaking to the man who reads this and quietly feels, “This sounds like me. This sounds like the kind of life I want too.” I think of this as more of a lighthouse than an advertisement.

Also, because it matters: this isn’t a casting call or a performance review. I’m not asking anyone to contort themselves into a role. I’m speaking to the men who already recognize themselves in most of what I’ve written. The ones who quietly think, “This is how I’m wired anyway.” From there, I’m inviting a conversation where we both get to be real, move slowly, and decide with clarity whether this actually feels mutual. If we choose each other, it will be on purpose and with consent, not because either of us pressured the other into a script.

One more thing. I also want to say this clearly: I am not posting from a place of panic or scarcity. My life is full. I have my family, my friends, my work, my projects, my music, my hobbies, and all the small rituals that make my days feel meaningful. I know I am a good partner and a good woman. I would rather stay single for a long time than say yes to a connection that is misaligned or unsafe.

I know this is a lot to take in, and that is on purpose. You deserve to have enough of me on the page to decide clearly whether this is something you want to step toward. This is not only for my sake. It is for yours too. I would rather you read this and think, “She is too much for me,” or “This is not what I want,” and have the choice to walk away now than feel surprised later. You deserve to make an informed choice about where you offer your time, heart, and energy.

# Introduction

I’m a straight, cis woman, and I’m looking for a straight, cis man for a committed, monogamous relationship that can grow into marriage. That is the kind of partnership I’m wired for.

I am 29, demisexual, and based on the East Coast of the United States. I am very slow to attach, and when I do it is deep, long-term, and very hard to undo.

In case it helps you make an honest choice, I’m a petite Black woman with a feminine, softly put-together style. People tend to notice my smile, my kind eyes, and how animated I get when I am talking about something I care about. I would rather you know that from the start so you can be honest with yourself about whether you feel attracted to me, knowing that I’m Black, instead of trying to talk yourself into it later. Once we have talked a bit, I am happy to exchange photos so you can see whether the person you are reading matches the person you see. I am sharing all of this so you can choose me on purpose, or kindly choose not to, and know that either choice is respected.

I connect through words first. Long, coherent, thoughtful conversations are how I learn someone’s mind, values, and wiring, and whether I can actually feel safe with them over time. Think of it as the knock on the door, not the key to everything. My attraction doesn’t wake up just because someone can write well; it only starts to stir once there is real emotional bond and trust. Once that bond is there, my romantic and sexual attention locks to my person and everyone else fades into the background. I am very loyal and very devoted by wiring and choice.

I’m warm but I’m not fragile, and I do well with calm, honest communication even when things are imperfect.

I am a reader, a thinker, a violinist who wandered away and came back, and a pianist who is still learning and loves to get lost in a nocturne. I love classical music, especially violin concertos and piano pieces you can cry or breathe to, and I also love easy listening and oldies like Frank Sinatra, Michael Bublé, and soft jazz that feels like slow dancing in the kitchen. I also have a nerdy side. I love board games and card games. I like creating and building things in every sense of the word, from worlds and systems on my computer to projects in real life that make life feel more purposeful and less random.

I enjoy jigsaw puzzles that I can come back to when my mind needs to wind down. I am an architect and engineer at heart because I love planning, seeing where pieces can fit and work together, and then building them to see the finished product. That shows up in a lot of what I do in my daily life: getting completely absorbed in good stories and falling down rabbit holes of research just to understand something better.

I really enjoy cooking (and will get very excited if you ask me about some of my recipes and how I approach it), road trips (I’ll get the snacks, you drive, our playlist on while we laugh and talk or ride in blissful silence), painting (both freestyle and paint by numbers), practicing my instruments, singing, going to classical concerts, walking and hiking, and getting completely absorbed in good books, movies, and series.

I move through the world with a lot of empathy and intensity. I think a lot about how people work, how stories move, and how to build small, repeatable ways of caring that make the people I love feel safer and more seen.

That covers a few chapters of my interests; the rest are better discovered slowly, alongside yours.

I feel things very deeply, so I tend to cry for strangers in real life when something devastating happens, and in movies when someone is ill or passes away. I will also hide under the covers when a scene is too much for me, like a little human blanket fort. Come find me! Hahaha! I also laugh a lot, often at myself. People tell me they feel strangely calm and understood after we talk, or that they sleep better that night. That matters more to me than any comment about how I look.

I am not looking for someone to rescue me. My life is my own and I am actively building it. I am looking for a partner to walk with, not a parent and not a project. I know I come with a lot of depth and a lot of feeling. I am aware that not everyone has the capacity or desire to meet me there, and that is alright. I would rather wait for the one person who does.

Underneath all of this, I genuinely want the world to be kinder. It might be a naive wish, but I hold to it and I try to live in a way that makes at least my small corner a softer place to land. In practice that means I care a lot about equality and human rights. I support the LGBTQIA+ community, bodily autonomy for women, and racial justice, and I am not interested in any form of racism, misogyny, or “hating men” either. If you agree with or are excited about MAGA or current right-wing politics, we are simply not going to be a fit.

I grew up Christian and I am now more agnostic than anything. I am not hostile to faith and I can enjoy being in inclusive, genuinely kind churches, but I no longer identify as Christian. I love long, honest conversations about belief, doubt, and meaning, as long as we are exploring together, not trying to convert each other.

I disagree with religious patriarchy and I do not want a relationship where “head of the household” means I am small and voiceless. At the same time, I know I am happiest with a partner who enjoys leading in a mutual, grown up way. Someone who asks for my perspective, respects my autonomy, and still enjoys being the one who says, “I have us. I will take care of this.”

# I like:

\- Long, wandering conversations about how people work and how the world works, then spiraling into all sorts of different topics: real estate, the ocean, space, history, science, finances, what the messages (or our interpretations of the messages) in movies mean, what happens after we die, and more. I’m curious and I ask a lot of questions. Sometimes you’ll know the answers, sometimes I will, and sometimes we’ll end up learning together.

\- Talking with my whole body. I am very expressive. My hands and facial expressions do a lot of the storytelling too. They are paid actors, and they love their jobs. I am also very enthusiastic and will beam when I am interested in a subject.

\- Classical music, especially violin concertos, piano nocturnes, and my Christmas music playlist (“Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” included 🎶). Sorry, got sidetracked for a moment there.

\- Curling up with a book when it rains, with either silence or classical music in the background, and my tea or my creamy vanilla mushroom coffee.

\- Burrowing under a mountain of blankets and pillows. I think I was a bear in another life. Come dig me out and we can laugh hysterically while we are at it. I will probably end up pulling you into my secret lair. Cuddles for days, please!

\- Nostalgia. Oh sweet nostalgia. Bring me back to the days where I would laugh and play all day long with my siblings, not a care in the world.

\- Writing too-long notes full of care, activities, rituals, and specific details that are just for us.

\- Emotional honesty, even when it is messy.

# How my attraction works

This is the part that took me a while to understand.

I am demisexual. For me that means:

\- I do not feel sexual attraction at all without a deep emotional connection. For me that also includes a very deep sense of safety, trust, and care.

\- It has only “switched on” twice in my entire life, both times after long, deep, text-based connection that extended to long voice conversations over long stretches of time.

\- Until that switch flips, I can appreciate that someone is handsome (this is rare for me), but my body and mind are quiet. It’s not a preference thing, it’s an actual wiring thing in my brain.

\- When it does flip, it feels like a very specific full-body sensation that comes in waves when I think about someone’s voice, their mind, their small kindnesses, and the future we might share.

Day to day, I move through the world feeling no sexual attraction to anyone. It only wakes up for one man when there is deep trust, emotional safety, deep care, and a lot of time together. When it does, it is very strong and very focused on him.

I cannot force this, and I cannot predict when it will happen. I can be talking to someone kind, interesting, and aligned with me on paper and still never feel that switch flip. I only know it has happened when my body finally catches up to what my heart and mind already trust. I need that safe space. And my body, heart, and mind know when it’s safe; I just listen to them.

I can go a long time without sex when I am not bonded to someone. That is partly because of how I’m wired and partly a conscious choice. I am capable of self control and I am not interested in having sex just to have it. At the same time, once that bond forms, my libido is very high toward my person only. I become extremely devoted, extremely focused, and extremely insatiable and affectionate in every sense of the word.

Lead the life with me, hold the frame, be protective, and once I trust you there, my whole body and heart will fall to you, and then we can be feral together, safely and only with each other. I will happily initiate often too; once I’m bonded, I’m enthusiastic, devoted, and very intentional about taking care of the man I’ve chosen.

Once that bond is there, I tend to attach very strongly. I get a little velcro with my person in the best way, very focused, very affectionate, very drawn to them in every sense. I want that closeness to be something we both enjoy, not something I have to shrink down or apologize for.

I am deeply monogamous in my wiring. Once I attach, every other “channel” shuts off. I do not look around. I do not keep options. It is one person, fully, or no one.

I’m comfortable starting long distance within the US because connection takes time for me anyway. If things grow, I do want a realistic path to meeting and eventually living in the same place.

Because of this, getting close to me is a slow burn and a higher investment. It takes time for me to bond, and there is no guarantee that it will happen. If it does, though, you end up with a partner whose desire, attention, and loyalty settle very tightly on you alone. If it does not, I would rather be honest and kind early than drag things out or hold you in limbo. The above also makes me very selective. If I am going to be extremely bonded to a man, I need to make sure that he is emotionally safe, consistent over time, aligned with me in values and affection, and genuinely ready for the kind of long-term partnership my wiring creates. I do not take that level of attachment lightly, so I am careful about who I invite into my life.

If you are someone who is patient, who is willing to let connection grow through long conversations and shared trust, safety, and care, and who loves the idea of being the one man my attraction slowly wakes up for while your own settles fully on me until we are both very focused and a little obsessed in a healthy way, then we will be starting from the same place. I am not looking for someone who wants to conquer or “unlock” me as a challenge. I am looking for a man who already knows he is wired for one person depth, who likes being that one person for me, and who is relieved to build that kind of deep, mutual, crazy about each other bond slowly with one woman.

He does not need to be demisexual himself, but he does need to understand that I am, and what that actually means in practice. It would be easier if we were wired similarly, but it is not a requirement. What is non-negotiable is that he is genuinely comfortable with a slow-burn pace, emotional connection first, and not pressuring physical milestones before my body and heart are ready.

I am looking for someone who understands that my devotion is something to protect, not control. If the idea of owning someone excites you, we are not a fit. If the idea of two adults choosing each other with that level of depth feels grounding and good, then we will understand each other very well.

Appearance does matter to me, but not in a “you must look like a model” way. I don’t have a rigid type. I need to find you at least quietly handsome in my own eyes, and over time, the way you love, show up, and move through the world will become what “attractive” looks like to me. I care far more about feeling safe, chosen, and cherished than about specific features or hair color.

If you describe yourself as hopeless or worthless because of your face or height, and that has hardened into bitterness toward the world or toward women, we will not be a fit. If you’ve felt lonely for a long time but stayed kind, and you’re doing the work to build a life you can respect, I will probably recognize you immediately.

# What I am looking for

I am looking for one man. If I try to describe him, it looks something like this.

**Core character**

\- Kind at the bone, not performatively nice.

\- Loyal. If he says he will be there, he is there.

\- Protective without being controlling. The type who will walk on the street side of the sidewalk, notice when I am overwhelmed, and quietly make things easier.

\- Integrity oriented. He tries to do what is right even when nobody is watching.

\- Kind to people who cannot give him anything back. Service staff, children, elders, animals. He does not “accidentally” snap at them.

\- Thoughtful and genuinely curious. He does not need to be a genius, but he does need to enjoy thinking: reading, learning, asking questions, and following his curiosity into different topics.

\- Able to meet me mentally. I want a partner who can carry real conversations, not just small talk. Someone who can sit with me for hours, moving from silly to serious to philosophical.

\- His mind is engaged with the world. I am not a great match with someone whose main hobby is gaming for hours every day. If he plays video games, that is a small part of a larger, active life, not where all of his free time and attention go.

**Emotional wiring**

\- Slow to attach. He does not fall in love every week and he is honest about that. Even if he has only fallen once, or not at all, that is alright with me.

\- Once he does attach, he is steady, not hot and cold.

\- Either demisexual, greysexual, or naturally slow burn. He is comfortable building connection through conversation and shared moments before anything physical.

\- Able to talk about what he feels, even if the words come slowly. He does not shut down, mock, or lash out when things get vulnerable.

\- In public he is more reserved and self-contained. In private, with me, he lets himself be fully soft, but it is all the same man. There is no charming public mask and cruel private version.

**Relational style**

\- Deeply monogamous and partner focused. Not interested in hookup culture, casual sex, sexting, or “see where it goes” situationships.

\- Sees partnership as a team. Not “my life plus a cute extra,” but “our life that we build on purpose.”

\- Emotionally safe to be around. His presence calms more than it agitates. In conflict he stays low voiced. He does not use volume, sarcasm, or threats. He already has self control.

\- Gentle but firm. He can hold boundaries kindly and accept mine.

\- His masculinity is rooted, not fragile. It is a quiet lion heart, not a loud ego. He is not threatened by a woman’s intelligence, success, feelings, or past. He is not looking for someone to mother him. He is emotionally safe and very grounded in his masculinity, who can be gentle with me and strong for us.

\- He has some kind of inner compass, whether that is religious, spiritual, or philosophical, but he does not see my beliefs as something to override or “correct.”

\- He understands that intimacy is earned, not owed. He is attracted to emotional connection, respect, shared safety, care, and time, not instant access.

\- He is comfortable leading in a healthy way. He likes taking initiative, making plans, and holding a steady sense of direction for our life, while still treating me as a full partner whose voice matters. I want us to be a team, with him often taking the first step and me right there beside him, not behind him and not above him.

\- In private, I’m happiest with a partner who’s naturally steady and dominant with me. Someone who can be primal and possessive in a deep and loving way, while still treating me like something precious: deeply kind, protective, and clearly devoted even when things get intense and feral.

\- You don’t have to wrestle me about roles; we’d already be on the same team by default. If you are kind, safe, steady, and real with me, I want you to lead, to be strong, and to have me. Be my steady, safe partner, and my devotion and surrender are the natural byproduct.

\- I have learned that I am simply not happy in relationships where I am functionally in the lead and my partner is coasting. I am looking for a man who enjoys being strong, steady, and decisive in a protective way, not a controlling one.

# How this shows up in everyday life

\- He texts or calls when he says he will.

\- He plans dates fully or shares the planning, and he follows through.

\- In a disagreement he does not yell, stonewall, or disappear.

\- If I say “I am tired, I need to rest,” he adjusts instead of making it about him.

\- He does not flirt with other women to provoke reactions.

\- He keeps our private life private. We are a sanctuary for each other.

\- In public he is respectful, observant, maybe a little quiet. In private he is able to melt, put his head in my lap, let me play with his hair while I hum to him or read, and he is able to actually rest.

—————————

# Life situation

\- Somewhere roughly 30s to mid 40s.

\- In the United States, ideally East Coast or a compatible time zone. I am open to starting long distance within the US as long as meeting in person is realistic and there is a genuine path to eventually living in the same place.

\- Has a life he is actively tending: work, hobbies, friendships. It does not have to be perfect, but he is not living in constant crisis or chasing risky schemes.

\- I am a divorced parent, and my child is a real part of my life. His father is active and we share 50-50 split custody at the moment, which means I also have regular kid-free time for my own life, hobbies, and relationships. I use my trusted babysitter on the weeks I have my child for evenings after bedtime, which means I have built-in kid-free weeks and evenings for dates, travel, and time with my person.

I’m very open to men who don’t have children yet and would be happy to love my child as part of loving me, and maybe choose more together in a stable marriage. I would love to grow a family together if that is something we both want and intentionally choose.

I can also be open to dads in certain situations. For example, if your children are older and more independent, or if you have shared custody in a way that gives us overlapping kid-free time so we can actually build a life together, not just weave around chaos.

Right now, it would be very hard for me to build a partnership with someone who has full-time custody of young children or is permanently tied to another state with no realistic path to eventually living in the same place. That’s not a judgment on you as a father; it’s simply me being honest about my bandwidth, my own custody reality, and wanting a structure where we can actually be together in everyday life and have a shared home someday, not just in messages.

\- I am not looking for someone to replace my child’s father. If a partner and my child ever meet, it will be slowly and only after we are serious about each other.

\- I am open to relocating. Me relocating is possible under certain circumstances, and only within the U.S. and Canada. Any long distance situation would need a realistic path to living in the same place in the future. My end goal is a shared physical life, not a permanent phone relationship.

\- Financially and career-wise, he is already established and stable. I have been the main earner and “fixer” before; I am not in a season where I can rebuild someone’s basic stability from the ground up again.

\- He is able and willing to be a provider in a practical sense. I am capable of working and I have my own career history, and I am doing what I need to do to support myself now. My honest long-term dream, though, is a marriage where he is the primary earner and I can be a stay at home wife and, if we have children, mother. I want my main work to be making our home a warm hearth and sanctuary. I will keep our home clean and organized, make sure he is well fed because I love to cook (and I am told my food is delicious by family, friends, and others, hahaha), and take care of much more of what makes a house a home and the people inside it feel loved. All that to say, there are other kinds of providing as well. I am more traditional in that sense because that is how I was raised and the example my parents set. I also want room to keep building my creative projects and businesses. He would genuinely prefer that I do not have to clock into a nine to five unless I want to, and he enjoys providing at a level where that is optional for me, not required. To me that feels like both of us contributing fully in different ways, not me “doing nothing” and not him being a walking wallet.

I also fully understand that life can change. Jobs can be lost, seasons can shift, needs can arise. If we need to adjust for a time and I go back into traditional work so that we both carry the load, that is not a failure to me. That is partnership. The dream is that a nine to five is optional for me, not that you are never allowed to need support.

I also want him to know that I am financially responsible and that I take our shared life seriously. I was raised around nice things and experiences, and I do enjoy comfort and quality, but I am not someone who needs constant luxury spending to feel okay. I am not chasing every new trend, procedure, or status symbol. I do not need expensive nails, cosmetic work, or a rotating closet of designer labels to feel beautiful or worthy. I care more about what makes sense for our life than what looks impressive online.

I like good, solid things that last, things that make our home feel warm and our lives run smoothly, not purchases that put us under strain. I want our partnership to reflect that. I will respect the budget we agree on, I will not undermine what you are building, and I will always see our money as something we steward together, not a prize I get to burn through. The dream is a soft life that feels peaceful and stable for both of us, not a performance of wealth that leaves you exhausted.

If you enjoy spoiling your partner sometimes, I will be deeply appreciative, but you will still catch me choosing things that strengthen our life and home together over flashy status symbols.

# His sexual and relationship history is not a performance metric

If you’ve never been in a relationship, that is not a dealbreaker or something that scares me. I respect late bloomers who have used their time to grow, build a life, and understand themselves. I genuinely do not care if you are a virgin, have had very few sexual experiences, or have never been in any romantic relationships at all. We will learn each other together. I will never hold “inexperience” against you. If anything, I actually prefer a man who hasn’t had a long list of partners, because I haven’t either. To me that speaks more to discernment, wiring, and circumstance than deficiency. There is nothing wrong with you. You can be exactly where you are and still be worthy of a good partnership. If we align, we’ll learn each other together.

\- He is not bitter at women or the world, even if he feels exhausted. He may be weary, but he has not let that harden into cruelty.

\- He lives most of his life offline. I rarely post on social media and I am not interested in documenting our relationship for an audience. He does not need to hide me, but he prefers that what we have feels real in private, not performed for strangers. He might have seasons where he scrolls more, especially when life is heavy or lonely, but the internet is not where he spends most of his free time. His default is real life. He would rather read, build things, play games at the table, move his body, or just be with me and his people.

\- He has at least some experience beyond his hometown, whether through travel, living in different places, or work that exposed him to other environments. I grew up traveling with my family, often internationally, and it shaped how I see the world and what I hope to share with a partner. I do not need someone who has lived my exact story, but I do need someone who is open to seeing more together and who does not resent that part of my life.

\- He enjoys travel or is at least genuinely open to it in a grounded way. I am not interested in constant vacations or going into debt for experiences, but it matters to me that we can plan occasional trips and vacations without resentment, respect the places we visit, and see them as shared memories more than something to show off.

**In simple words:** I am looking for the man who is built for deep, long-haul partnership. He does not need to be flashy or charismatic. He does need to be kind, honest, emotionally present, protective, and willing to choose one person and keep choosing.

I got no response and left it at that but a month later he again appeared on my snap by toggleing his activity status and then changing his settings so I could see his snapscore, birthday and other stuff. Between these cycle he was following random girls on Instagram and try to distract I guess. A month after the snap toggleing he unblocked me on Instagram and couple of days later he just randomly unfollowed every girl on his Instagram and his parents and started reposting sad existential reels. He went quite for couple of days until he made his Instagram private and the next day he set his snap settings so I could no longer see the extra info (snapscore, birthday,...). After that he toggled his activity status for couple of weeks and then everything stopped. Two weeks after the last toggle I texted him on Instagram and asked a question about something he's interested in. My ex read the message in 15 min and didn't reply. Yesterday, more than two weeks after my last message, I texted him if we could meet for a cup of coffee and talk. He saw the message in 14 min and less than an hour later responded with ""Hi, thank you for texting me. I don't think that meeting would be a good idea. I wish you all the best."" and I responded with ""Hi, thank you for replying. I will respect your decision. If you ever want to talk- text me. Good luck"".

1r9uulx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuildToAttract/comments/1r9uulx/how_to_talk_to_women_without_being_weird/,How to Talk to Women Without Being Weird: Psychology-Backed Tricks That Actually Work,"Okay, real talk. If you're struggling to talk to women, you're not alone. Most guys freeze up, overthink every word, or just avoid the situation entirely. And honestly? Society doesn't help. We're bombarded with pickup artist nonsense, toxic masculinity bullshit, and zero actual guidance on how to have genuine human conversations.



I've spent way too much time researching this, reading books by psychologists, relationship experts, even diving into communication research. Not because I'm some guru, but because I was tired of watching guys (myself included) fumble basic interactions. Here's what actually works, backed by real experts and science, not some dude's ""alpha male"" fantasy.



\## Step 1: Kill the Pedestal Mentality



First thing? Women are just people. I know, groundbreaking insight, right? But seriously, the moment you put someone on a pedestal just because of their gender, you've already lost. You start acting weird, filtering everything you say, trying to impress them instead of just... talking.



Dr. Aziz Gazipura's book \*Not Nice\* talks about this perfectly. He breaks down how being overly nice or trying too hard to please actually comes from fear and insecurity, not genuine kindness. Women can smell that desperate energy from a mile away.



Mindset shift: Talk to women the same way you'd talk to anyone else you find interesting. You wouldn't interview a new guy friend for approval, right? Same energy here.



\## Step 2: Stop Making It About Attraction (At First)



Here's where most guys screw up. They walk into every conversation with a woman thinking, ""Does she like me? Am I attractive enough? What if I say something stupid?"" That's your anxiety talking, not reality.



Mark Manson's \*Models: Attract Women Through Honesty\* is stupidly good on this. He argues that true attraction comes from being authentic and vulnerable, not from performing or following some script. Women are attracted to guys who are comfortable in their own skin, not dudes trying to be someone they're not.



Real talk: Start conversations with zero agenda. Practice talking to women in low-stakes situations, coffee shops, bookstores, wherever, just to get comfortable. No pickup lines. No ulterior motives. Just human interaction.



\## Step 3: Ask Actually Interesting Questions



Most conversations die because guys ask boring questions or just wait for their turn to talk. ""What do you do?"" ""Where are you from?"" Zzzzz. That's interview mode, not conversation.



Instead, ask open-ended questions that spark curiosity:



\* ""What's something you're weirdly passionate about?""  

\* ""If you could change careers tomorrow, what would you do?""  

\* ""What's the most interesting thing you've learned recently?""



The goal isn't to interrogate. It's to create space for actual conversation. And here's the kicker, actually listen to the answers. Not just waiting for your turn to talk, but genuinely engaging with what she's saying.



Chris Voss's \*Never Split the Difference\* (yeah, it's a negotiation book, but trust me) has insane communication techniques. One gem? Mirroring. Repeat the last few words someone said as a question. It shows you're listening and keeps them talking.



Her: ""I just got back from this crazy hiking trip.""  

You: ""Crazy hiking trip?""  

Her: continues talking and opening up



\## Step 4: Share, Don't Perform



Conversations are two-way streets. If you're just asking questions without sharing anything about yourself, you come off as either boring or like you're hiding something.



Balance is key: Share your own stories, opinions, and experiences. But don't monologue. Don't try to one-up her stories. Just... be a normal human who has things to say.



Example: She talks about loving a certain band. Instead of just nodding, share what music you're into or a concert experience you had. Make it a back-and-forth exchange, not a performance review.



\## Step 5: Body Language Isn't Some Mystery Code



There's so much overthinking about body language. ""Should I lean in? Make eye contact? What do I do with my hands?"" Relax. Your body language should match your energy, confident but not aggressive, relaxed but engaged.



Basics that matter:



\* Eye contact: Hold it, but don't stare like a psycho. Look away naturally when talking.  

\* Posture: Stand or sit up straight. Slouching screams insecurity.  

\* Space: Don't invade her personal bubble, but don't stand 10 feet away either.  

\* Smile: A genuine smile (not a creepy smirk) goes a long way.



Vanessa Van Edwards' \*Captivate\* dives deep into nonverbal communication. She talks about how people decide if they trust you within the first few seconds based on your body language. The good news? Small tweaks make a huge difference.



\## Step 6: Humor, But Make It Real



Everyone says ""be funny,"" but that doesn't mean you need to be a standup comedian. Forced jokes are painful. What actually works? Playful banter and not taking yourself too seriously.



Tease lightly (without being mean), laugh at yourself, find humor in the moment. If you mess up a sentence or say something awkward, just acknowledge it and move on. Women appreciate guys who don't crumble at the first sign of imperfection.



\## Step 7: Handle Rejection Like an Adult



Here's the uncomfortable truth: Not every woman will want to talk to you. And that's okay. Rejection isn't a reflection of your worth. It just means you weren't a match for that person in that moment.



Matthew Hussey (relationship coach) has a great YouTube channel where he talks about reframing rejection. Instead of seeing it as failure, see it as filtering. You're looking for people who vibe with you, not trying to win over everyone.



If a conversation isn't flowing or she's clearly not interested? Gracefully exit. No guilt trips. No bitterness. Just, ""Cool chatting with you, take care."" And move on. That's mature, confident energy right there.



\## Step 8: Practice, Practice, Practice



You don't get good at conversations by reading about them. You get good by actually having them. Start small. Talk to people everywhere, grocery store, gym, wherever. Not with the goal of dating, just to build comfort with human interaction.



There's an app called Slowly where you can practice writing longer, more thoughtful conversations with people around the world. It's old-school pen pal vibes, which helps you get better at expressing yourself without the pressure of real-time responses.



If you want to go deeper but don't have the time or energy to read all these books, there's this personalized learning app called BeFreed that's been helpful. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it pulls insights from books like the ones mentioned here, plus dating psychology research and expert interviews, and turns them into audio sessions tailored to your specific goal.



You can tell it something like ""improve my conversation skills as an anxious introvert"" and it'll create a custom learning plan just for you. You can adjust the length from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Plus you can pick different voices, some people go for the smoky, confident narrator to keep them engaged during commutes or gym sessions. There's also a virtual coach you can chat with about your unique struggles. Makes internalizing this stuff way more practical than just reading theory.



\## Step 9: Fix Your Inner Game First



If you're deeply insecure, anxious, or dealing with self-esteem issues, no conversation technique will save you. Women pick up on that energy. You've got to work on yourself first.



Therapy helps. So does journaling. Apps like Finch (a self-care app) can help you build better mental habits. Read books like \*The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem\* by Nathaniel Branden. It's dense but transformative.



Bottom line: You can't build genuine connections with others if you don't have one with yourself.



\## Step 10: Stop Consuming Toxic Content



Seriously, get off the redpill forums, pickup artist channels, and anything that teaches manipulation tactics. That stuff poisons your mindset and makes you see women as targets, not people. It's gross and counterproductive.



Instead, follow people who teach authentic communication: Matthew Hussey, Mark Manson, Dr. Aziz Gazipura. People who focus on growth, honesty, and mutual respect.



\---



Look, talking to women isn't some dark art. It's just human connection. The more you practice being genuine, curious, and comfortable with yourself, the easier it gets. Stop overthinking. Start doing. You've got this.

The Medieval Martyrdom

**Name of Piece:** [Abraham in Nimrod's Furnace](https://www.thetorah.com/article/abrahams-prayer-and-ours-a-yom-kippur-illustration)

**Year Produced:** c. 1320

**Artist:** Anonymous Master of the Leipzig Mahzor

**Artist Biography:**  
The ""Master of the Leipzig Mahzor"" was an anonymous Jewish illuminator active in the early 14th century. He worked within the tradition of creating richly decorated prayer books (*mahzorim*) for medieval Ashkenazi communities in Germany. These artists used vivid color and symbolic shorthand to help worshippers identify with the trials of the patriarchs, often reflecting the contemporary persecutions and social divisions faced by Jews in medieval Europe.  
  
**Study Analysis:**  
This illustration from the *Leipzig Mahzor* captures a critical midrashic episode also detailed in Abraham 1: the patriarch’s confrontation with the god-king Nimrod in Ur. The scene shows Abraham being extracted from a furnace by a divine hand, a literal visualization of the ""trial of living or dying with his Truth"". This trial serves as a vital visual preface to the later Akedah, establishing Abraham as a figure whose faith was forged in the fire. The ""divine hand"" emphasizes the supernatural protection afforded to the patriarch as he separated himself from the idolatry of his father and king. Note the hand of God penetrating the veil to save Abraham.  
  
The Call to the Essence

**Name of Piece:** [Lech Lecha](https://www.yoramraanan.com/biblical-prints/lech-lecha)

**Year Produced:** 2014

**Artist:** Yoram Raanan

**Artist Biography:** Yoram Raanan is a contemporary Israeli artist who established a studio in the Judean hills after relocating from Philadelphia in 1977.His style is characterized by ""modern Jewish expressionism,"" utilizing intuition and imagination to capture spiritual energy rather than literal likenesses. Raanan frequently uses unconventional materials, such as pouring coffee grounds and acrylic binder across large canvases, to create textured landscapes that feel ""of the earth"" yet transcendent.

**Study Analysis:** This piece illustrates the command in Genesis 12:1 and Abraham 2:19: ""Get thee out of thy country... unto a land that I will show thee."" Raanan focuses on the Hebrew term for this command, *Lech Lecha*, which literally translates to ""Go to yourself"" or ""Go to your essence"". In the painting, a guiding light hangs behind Abraham as he wanders forward into a landscape of darkness and constriction, staff in hand. A ""golden axis of light"" in the figure of Abraham hints at his ""celestial elevation"" above the laws of nature. This visual interpretation frames the journey to Canaan not just as a geographical relocation, but as a spiritual process of ""digging physical and spiritual gold out of the darkness"".  
  
The Priesthood Prefiguration

**Name of Piece:** [The Meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Abraham_y_Melquisedec,_por_Juan_Antonio_de_Fr%C3%ADas.jpg)

**Year Produced:** 1668

**Artist:** Juan Antonio de Frías y Escalante

**Artist Biography:**  
Juan Antonio de Frías y Escalante (1633–1669) was a master of the Spanish Baroque who worked primarily in Madrid. He was heavily influenced by the Venetian school, particularly Tintoretto, whose impact is visible in Escalante's transparent glazes and vibrant palette. He was commissioned to paint an extensive series of eighteen canvases for the Merced Calzada convent, focusing on Old Testament episodes that functioned as liturgical ""prefigurations"" of Christian sacraments.  
  
**Study Analysis:**  
Illustrating Genesis 14:18–20, this painting captures the sacramental moment when Melchizedek, the ""priest of the most high God,"" brings forth bread and wine and blesses Abraham. Escalante portrays the exchange with a liturgical solemnity that highlights Melchizedek's priesthood authority. From a Restoration perspective, this encounter is critical for establishing the lineage of the ""higher priesthood"" and the principle of tithing. The use of luminous, celestial light reinforces the divine nature of the interaction, suggesting that the ""priesthood which was in the beginning"" was being actively transmitted to ensure the continuation of the covenant.

# The Domestic Covenant Trial

**Name of Piece:** [Sarah Leading Hagar to Abraham](https://www.theleidencollection.com/artwork/sarah-leading-hagar-to-abraham/)

**Year Produced:** 1673

**Artist:** Caspar Netscher

**Artist Biography:**  
Caspar Netscher (1639–1684) was a preeminent Dutch Golden Age painter famous for his ""elegant"" genre scenes and portraits. He was a master of depicting varied tactile surfaces, such as shimmering silk and gold ewers. While many of his contemporaries used the story of Abraham and Hagar to create salacious or moralizing scenes of ""mercenary love,"" Netscher sought to elevate his subjects into a refined historical and domestic context.  
  
**Study Analysis:**  
Netscher’s 1673 masterpiece focuses on the complex decision in Genesis 16, where the aged Sarah attempts to fulfill God’s promise through her Egyptian maid, Hagar. In contrast to earlier ""procuress"" tropes, Netscher presents Sarah as a ""dignified and mature woman"" acting in accordance with her status as the mother of a nation. The opulence of the setting—the plush carpets and gold vessels—symbolizes the wealth Abraham had amassed (Gen 13:2). The painting captures the desperation and pragmatism of the patriarchs as they navigated the gap between divine prophecy and their biological reality.

I’ve been trying to just see her a friend but I gotta be honest I still love her and very often cry still (not as much as before, but enough). Sometimes it’s great and we can be friends and it feels like it, other times it’s.. not and I get sad or depressed again. The kids don’t know we are getting divorced yet. I feel like it may not be possible to get over her in this particular situation however I really don’t want to leave either her or my kids.

I had tried to ask a woman for a coffee, figuring it may help getting over my wife, but it fell through. My wife said if that’s the only thing that may help me be happy then I have her blessing to try dating but I kind of don’t want to and am not having much luck at it. I do know that she said she’s not ready for dating herself however dabbled in it on FB dating and deleted it after a guy she talked to asked her back to his house right away.

I know they send samplers for feedback to many members of the group.finally my turn genuinely no bias here, sharing honest take only.   
  
it was a normal linen envelope which contained a bag of powder in a ziplock bag and a folded letter inside. after reading the letter i realised its their next unflavoured whey sent by food pharmer.   
  
it literally had no packing/ labelling anything that could tell that it was from only what's needed. just your avg joe ziplock bag (ig they're building onto the 'transparency' approach)   
  
letter basically said that when doctors look at blood reports across india, the same issues keep popping up... low protein intake, vitamin D3 and low B12. they said this product is their way of tackling that. so apart from whey, they’ve added amounts of vitamin D3 and B12 too. attaching pic below if anyone wants to read it.   
  
mixability - in the letter they claimed that the protein can be mixed with just a spoon so i went ahead and tried it...90% of it dissolved and a few lumps still remained for which i used a whisk. I have said the same thing in my review also. IK they were working on the mixability since months so this is a step ahead.   
  
Taste and Texture - it tasted just like water with a base-like after taste which unflavoured whey is actually meant to taste like. texture was smooth overall.   
  
Frothing (idk why people consider it a problem but anyways ) - added water to the protein and it started frothing instantly and the froth settles in a span of 2-3 minutes.   
  
Pricing - i am not sure what the price point is gonna be honestly. Until they launch i can just assume it’ll be on same range as other quality ones out there.

-side-sleeping without ear pain
-consistent background masking (not just loud ANC)
-sleep-focused modes so I’m not fiddling at 2am

It wasn’t that I lacked motivation, but most of the time I was in a tired, burned-out state. I experienced brain fog and derealization at random times throughout the day, sometimes lasting for hours. Occasionally, I could be motivated and energetic, feeling the way I was supposed to feel. I also had the stereotypical dark circles under my eyes.  
Since coming out of chronic withdrawal, it’s like night and day. Sure, I have fewer highs, but I almost never experience lows, and I never run out of energy during the day. When I come home, I’m not physically or mentally drained—I have energy to do almost anything. I can go to the gym and afterward still do something social, and I’m present, engaged, and maintaining stable energy levels.   
I also notice some of my colleagues who have light, repetitive tasks and how they sometimes complain about being “sooo tired” or stressed and irritable, even though their work is mostly easy-going. I can understand them because I was there and felt the same way.  
Some colleagues are experimenting with reducing caffeine to see if it helps with these symptoms.  
My point is that there isn’t enough information worldwide about how regular caffeine use may affect mental and physical health. Btw I still have a cup of coffee occasionally and feel its full effects, since I no longer have much tolerance.

Most of my classmates are 18–21 or 60-80, so I’d love to connect with someone closer to my age while I’m there.

	•	Coffee

	•	A good thrift store

	•	Something culturally interesting

	•	Maybe clubbing (I’m sober, but I still love the atmosphere)

I’m currently staying sober for personal growth reasons, but I don’t mind what others choose for themselves.

A bit about me:

	•	Queer

	•	Into art, DJing, photography

	•	Former gamer (WoW, N64/GBA/PS2/PS3/PS4, got rid of all my consoles to produce and be creative, instead of consuming so much, but getting a PS5 for the new GTA)

	•	Big nerd, deep thinker

	•	Love philosophy, psychology, consciousness, weird conversations

	•	into fitness and health; Snowboarder, nature lover, yoga/meditation person

	•	Music taste: indie, electronic music, dark disco, house, lounge; somewhere between Ibiza sunset and Berlin basement

i spent the last few years being absolutely $hit at talking to humans.

whenever i’d try to be *""social,*"" my brain would just lag like a windows 95 computer. 

i’d default to these boring, transactional interview questions: 

*""hi, hru? what’s your major? do you like... stuff?""*

it was exhausting. i felt like an alien trying to pass as a person, and usually, 

i’d end up accidentally calling a stranger ""dad"" or apologizing to a mannequin because i bumped into it (true story).

Sad I know..

honestly, i hated myself for it. i’d go home and replay my ""cringe greatest hits"" at 2 a.m. while my judgmental cat, stared at me like the wanted to sue me for not feeding him on time.

but i tried something different recently because i was tired of wanting to evaporate every time i stood in a coffee line.

**i stopped trying to be ""normal"" and started owning my weirdness.**



instead of panic-asking a 5th question about the weather, i just started admitting the truth in the moment.

the other day, a conversation died. instead of forcing it, i just said: 

*sorry, i just realized i'm interrogating you like a police officer. my social brain is lagging today lol.""*

the person actually laughed. 

a real, non-pity laugh. the ""glitch"" was the thing that actually made us connect.



**here is the ""drill"" i’ve been using:** 

next time you’re in a ""transactional"" loop, don't ask another question. 

stop. 

share a tiny, low-stakes truth about how you’re feeling right then.

something like: 

*""i'm so caffeinated right now i've forgotten how to use nouns""* or 

*""i always get nervous talking to people who look like they actually have their life together.""* 

it’s a social cheat code. 

the moment you admit you aren't ""perfect,"" the other person stops feeling like they have to be perfect, too. 

it breaks the ""interview"" spell immediately.

i’m still a bit of a socially anxious potato, but at least i’m a potato that can survive a conversation without wanting to fake my own death.

if you’re spiraling today because you think you’re ""broken,"" you’re not. 

you’re just human, and humans are messy, cringey creatures.

1r9u7yh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r9u7yh,TWW Update,"[A week ago I asked how much of a difference TWW makes](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1r3o69w/how_much_of_a_difference_does_third_wave_water/). The consensus was giving it a try was worth it and that a lot of folks here had good experiences switching to TWW from tap/bottled water, so I went ahead and bought a set. Due to the Lunar New Year, my long awaited set just arrived today!

I diluted my TWW by half (thanks u/squidbrand for the tip!!) - did this by first adding a whole TWW sachet to an empty 2L water bottle, filling it with Zero Water, then pouring half to another empty 2L water bottle and then filling both water bottles with Zero Water.

# Experiment

(I didn't do a blind test yet today but just going from memory and my brew notes)

**The water I was originally using:**  
TDS: 72ppm

Alkalinity: 21.7mg/L 

**TTW Light Roast half dilution:**

TDS: 78ppm

Alkalinity: Couldn't check this but [should be roughly 20mg/L](https://support.thirdwavewater.com/en-US/what-is-in-third-wave-water-76575)

# Brews

3 different beans, same method - Coffee Chronicle's Switch recipe. All with 85 degrees water temp. 35 sec percolation instead of 45, up to 2 minutes immersion. Same grinder setting for all.

\- Orange Striped Wush Wush Anaerobic Natural 72 Hours (Colombia)

\- Guji Carbonic Maceration (Ethiopia)

\- Gedeb Wuri Washed (Ethiopia)

# Result

I had high expectations trying this water out and honestly? I don't see myself going back to regular water after trying this out - the difference was night and day. I'm aware that TWW has different minerals and stuff made specifically to make light roasts taste better, but considering the fact that my the water I used originally has pretty much the same TDS and Alkalinity levels as this TWW water, I didn't expect the difference to be this big.

First of all - no astringency or bitterness. [I posted a while back on this sub about consistently getting bitter and astringent brews with both the Anaerobic and the Carbonic Maceration](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1qy73z9/hario_switch_getting_bitter_and_astringent_coffee/) . Lowering the water temp helped a lot, but there was still some astringency and bitterness, especially in the aftertaste.   
  
Using this water - the Wush Wush for example had a very pleasant, redcurrant/raisin-like aftertaste. And the Carbonic Maceration-processed beans I thought I wasn't a big fan of tasted winey and grape-y in a pleasant way. All three beans I brewed were sweeter than usual, and less acidic. Fruit-forward, but not acidic in that vinegary/lemony kind of way, if I'm making sense.

If anyone is on the fence regarding TWW like myself, I can highly recommend giving it a try - even if the water you're currently using is soft and has alkalinity within the recommended ranges for the type of beans you're brewing. 

  
**tldr:**  
TWW is 🐐. Well worth the money for me, even though my water was already good. Made my brews sweeter, more fruit-forward and less acidic. I guess the word I'm looking for here is it brings out more clarity?
