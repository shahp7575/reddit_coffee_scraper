1jj3hic,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1jj3hic/how_i_landed_my_first_internship/,How I landed my first internship,"I started searching for an internship on spring, but because I didn‚Äôt know what to do, I wasted several months during that time. I finally landed my first fall internship at the end of summer. I was completely unfamiliar with the job positions related to my major and interests. I didn‚Äôt know which websites were suitable for students looking for internships, how to prepare my resume and cover letter, or how to get ready for different interview stages. At first, I couldn‚Äôt even pass the phone screen.  


First, clarify what you want to do in the future.  
  
For me, if I‚Äôm not interested in something, I can‚Äôt see myself doing it as a job. I tried applying to several different directions (still a little relevant to my major) and joined school projects to gain real-world experience (with lower requirements than interns). After trying roles in 2 areas, I finally landed my first internship in the 3rd.üòÇ

Secondly, move toward your ideal role and find projects that can strengthen your resume.

Based on my internship and full-time job search, and coffee chats with seniors and hiring managers, they all mentioned that **a candidate's major and school name are not the most important factors** (unless the company specifically hires from target schools). What truly matters is **how relevant your projects and experience are to the role you‚Äôre applying for**. For example, even if you graduate from Wharton with a finance major, without any data-related projects, it doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll land a data scientist role at a local startup. My first internship and later my full-time job, were both unrelated to my major. But I supplemented my experience with industry-related school projects and identified relevant courses on Coursera that matched the job requirements. I like to think of those new courses as forming my minor major.

Thirdly, revise your resume and start searching for internships.

When you have projects to include on your resume, present them using the STAR method, clearly highlight and quantify the results you achieved, and use ChatGPT to help tailor your resume to the positions you‚Äôre applying for. (For full-time job searching, I combined Teal with ChatGPT, since full-time applications are usually more competitive and restrictive than internships.) I initially used Indeed to search for internships, but there weren‚Äôt many openings. The same goes for LinkedIn, it‚Äôs better suited for full-time roles. You can still follow recruiters or managers on LinkedIn for opportunity posts, or connect with alumni for potential referrals, though in my case, I never made it. I finally switched to Handshake, which turned out to be a smarter choice. I landed my first internship there, and many of my schoolmates found theirs on the same platform.

Fourth, prepare your own interview cheat sheet.

It's the most difficult part for me. I actually started receiving interviews after several applications, but I kept failing and never knew how to solve it. I experienced the most awkward group interview in the world. I even failed the phone screen (I didn't even know how to introduce myself!). I realized I had to prepare my own cheat sheet. It's unhelpful to directly use what ChatGPT generates based on your resume, you must add your own thoughts and practice thousands of times to make sure you're completely familiar with your story. I checked Glassdoor‚Äôs communities to see ex-candidates' reviews, used AMA Interview‚Äôs question prediction feature, and asked ChatGPT to give me example answers tailored to my resume. For general roles, I built a cheat sheet for frequently asked phone screens and behavioral questions. You can even find patterns in tech interviews. For specific roles, I still used this outline and added the details.",1,1742854133.0,interviews,0,1.0,False

I went to 1951 to finish up some work and got an iced cherry vanilla latte I like how it wasn‚Äôt sweet and had a good strong taste of expresso which really woke me up.

Afterwards I went with my friend to eat Cream and he recommended the ice cream sandwich 

I got an oatmeal cookie that had dried cranberries, apples, and pumpkin seeds and paired it with a green tea ice cream 
I wish the ice cream had a stronger flavor of matcha but overall it was decent but kind of hard to eat because it was so thick 
My friend got a double chocolate chip cookie with some sort of coffee ice cream but he would prefer them separately from each other and not in a sandwich

1jj3gcx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jj3gcx,Pinocchio Especiale Tasting Notes,"How It Was Crafted

1 piece of Hubba-Bubba (this was the gum referenced during an Adventuring party) placed in 2 oz of the most average whiskey.  Two identical vessels were used for 4 oz of bubblegum-infusio.  I was absolutely not investing in making a large quantity of this as it seemed a terrible idea from the beginning.

After 30 days of steeping the bubble gum in the whiskey I filtered out the chunky bits with coffee filters.  This yielded 3 and a half-ish oz of bubblegum-infused whiskey.

2 oz went into one of the cleaned vessels.
1.5oz went into the other cleaned vessel.

One of the tasting notes that Lou came up with is that as Pinochio lacks organs the whiskey seeps into his leg and ages there.

Into the 1.5 oz container I added an oak heavy whiskey I have been aging in my dinning room for the last 9 months.

Tasting Notes.
A friend was mad enough to agree to try this with me.  All of the samples had been chilled as I did not want to dilute the flavor profiles with ice/water.

1st Taste Test
The first course was a sample of the basic whiskey I had used.  It was exceptionally average.
2 out of 5 sexy fairies.

2nd Taste Test
The second one was the pure bubblegum infused whiskey.  If you LOVE bubblegum you will love this.  If you hate whiskey or hate yourself, this is for you.  It was bad, bubblegum flavored toothpaste had nothing on it.  Pure overwhelming bubblegum that ranksacks your tastebuds and steals your wallet.  Calling it bubblegum forward is a lie and understatement.  Bubblegum assault enhanced by the alcohol is more accurate. 

0 sexy fairies and instead one mouth covered Eldritch nightmare GodMother.

3rd Taste Test
The third was bubblegum whiskey mixed with about ¬Ω ounce of oak aged whiskey.  The oak mellowed the bubblegum and the flavors balanced each other.  We sipped it.  Certainly I would consider it ‚Äúgood‚Äù adjacent.  Not a drink anyone would want with frequency, but not the most vile thing I have drunk.  Accurate to the tasting notes given by the table and in an emergency, I could see drinking it if nothing else was available.

I learned nothing, and will happily make more awful booze ideas from Dimension 20.

I want to share my story to help process and get support from you that this was abuse.

I may have dated an abuser. Probably a sociopath/psycho/narc

Story: 
I met someone in the elevator of campus and instantly thought maybe he was my husband. But he worried me because he just had the look of someone who is a player, and appeared mysterious. Because of that, I suggested he actually get to know my acquaintance. But then we started to fall for eachother hard. Yet, he asked me on a date AND at the same time pursued an acquaintance. I somehow ignored this red flag and felt like the chosen one when we kept talking instead of her. 

He got me drunk and slept with me right away and I was too drunk to even give consent but didn‚Äôt quite register that. He made grand gestures to fly to see me from across the country, but then mentioned how my furniture was easily replaceable if I were to move closer to him (implying it wasn‚Äôt expensive). He asked me to stay with him for 2 weeks and he planned an itinerary that covered every single day filled with activities. He did regularly split the bill however - even though he owned a luxury condo a fancy range and all other kinds of expensive things and made sure I knew of it. He went through a marriage book called ‚Äú8 dates to marriage‚Äù with me excitedly making it seem we were in it for the long haul and even asking what it would be like to ask my dad for my hand 

At some point we would bicker because he saw I was going out with friends, since we had shared location, and he got insecure and drunkenly yelled at me. Ever since then, he started to become‚Ä¶hot and cold, him neglecting me - he kissed me on the lips a total of 6 times in our 8 month relationship. He regularly put me down, told me I run weirdly, that I‚Äôm ‚Äúthe darkest person here‚Äù while in France (I‚Äôm not white), that my job wasn‚Äôt as high level as he thought it was, that I have flat feet, that I have blisters on my feet, pointing out when a girl was checking him out or that a friend wanted to set him up with someone but found out he was taken, criticizing my movements in front of his friends as though I was embarrassing him, having me fly out every week to see him and only seeing me twice.. gaslighting me anytime I called him out  - asking for a girls number in front of me and then saying it was for networking . He once pretended to choke me and also forcibly craned my neck to the mirror and held it really hard and said don‚Äôt you see how beautiful you are? He always walked one full block ahead of me and when I commented that it wasn‚Äôt very nice he would say ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre too slow.‚Äù

He told me he‚Äôd dispose of my body in his closet drawer, jokingly. 

When he had sex with me he wouldn‚Äôt really check if he was hurting me and sometimes I‚Äôd move backwards to reduce the intensity and he‚Äôd just grab me back to him and laughingly say ‚Äúwhere do youu think you‚Äôre going?‚Äù

He would always mention whenever a girl was ‚Äúmaking eyes‚Äù at him. He always seemed nervous when he introduced me to his friends or we all hung out together, as though I was embarrassing. 

He was very mean to me for being slow at ordering my coffee at breakfast at an amazing resort in France. When we hiked he was always walking way far ahead of me and not even checking to see if I was behind him 

Anytime I tried to progress things past being exclusive he said he needed me to move to his city but then whenever I would make plans to he said he would hate if I moved and it didn‚Äôt work out and then I hated him. 

He only ever cuddled me twice. He slept hugging pillows otherwise and claimed it was bc an ex liked cuddling and he got so used to it he replaced that with pillows. 

When I cried about personal things to him he would  roll over and decide to just sleep instead of saying anything or comforting me

He drove me to a point where I had to take a few days of space from him and all this mistreatment that he then dumped me claiming I ghosted him then told me he wanted to stay in touch and that he still had hope

Then he began to follow and get closer to the girl I was worried about while we were dating and now they‚Äôre close, but he claims that she has a bf.

He said he has nothing but positive feelings for me  - and was surprised when I mentioned his mistreatment, saying ‚Äúyou never mentioned any of this before..‚Äù as though to discredit it. The next day he laid on the charm thick and even hit on me and I fell for it and told him maybe we can still be together one day and he slammed that door shut and ignored me. I felt so stupid after that but realize maybe it was a trauma reaction from me. 

Recently I went to school and one of his closest friends pretended like he didn‚Äôt hear me say hi and cruelly made a weird expression, like of disgust and being pompous and walked arrogantly right past me. It humiliated me. I texted my ex and told him, and said maybe I shouldn‚Äôt attend the class event the next day bc it‚Äôs uncomfortable. and he responds by saying ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt told anyone anything. You should go bc I‚Äôm sick and might not be there.‚Äù 

So I went to the event and my ex came up to me and said ‚Äúsee this isn‚Äôt bad you‚Äôre such a drama queen‚Äù and he looked very weird.

I was in there with my two teenage kids, and we were the table directly behind these two gentlemen, so that‚Äôs why we could hear everything. 

They both order black coffee and the quick 2-egg breakfast (which comes with bacon.) Simple enough. Except when the waitress (who has probably 10 other tables in varying stages of eating) brings their food, one of them says ‚ÄúI ordered sausage. Take this back.‚Äù (No, you didn‚Äôt, but okay.) 

Waitress goes back to the kitchen, gets sausage. Brings back plate. 

‚ÄúI actually wanted sausage PATTIES, not links. I don‚Äôt like these.‚Äù

# [October 22, 2037 | 0625 Hours GMT | Near Callisto]

The Phobos accelerated away from the formation, its ECM arrays already pulsing with disruptive energy. The sleek destroyer angled sharply toward the Grey platform hiding in Callisto's shadow. Launch bay doors slid open along its ventral spine, releasing a wave of interceptors that fanned out in attack formation.

On the Deimos bridge, Gibson watched grimly as the tactical display tracked the Phobos's unauthorized assault.

""What's their status?"" he demanded.

Khan's fingers danced across her station. ""ECM suite at full power. They've deployed all four interceptor wings. The Grey platform shows no immediate response‚Äîlooks like the jamming is working.""

""For now,"" Roarke muttered.

Gibson tapped his comm. ""Commodore Thorne, we need to accelerate our slingshot. If Asoka's attack fails, we'll have Grey vessels on our tail before we reach the Asteroid Belt.""

""Already adjusting course,"" Thorne replied, her voice tight with controlled anger. ""Damocles is pushing engines to 115% capacity. I've reported Commander Asoka's violation to High Command. They're demanding her immediate removal from command, but have agreed to postpone official court-martial proceedings until after the operation concludes.""

""Understood, Commodore. Your call,"" Gibson acknowledged, deferring to her authority.

""For now, we focus on the mission,"" Thorne continued. ""DEIMOS, recalculate our approach vector accounting for potential pursuit from Jovian-based Grey vessels.""

""Calculating,"" the AI responded. ""Updated trajectory requires 22% additional velocity from the slingshot maneuver. Adjusting gravitational approach angles now.""

Around Callisto, the Phobos's interceptors executed a coordinated attack pattern. Unlike traditional fighters, they moved with eerie precision‚Äîeach craft maintaining perfect spatial relationship with its wingmates as they closed on the Grey platform.

""The platform is powering up defensive systems,"" Khan reported. ""Energy spike detected. They're launching countermeasures.""

The tactical display showed dozens of small craft erupting from the Grey vessel‚Äîclassic disc-shaped UFOs that moved with impossible agility, darting toward the human interceptors.

""Swarm craft,"" Gibson identified. ""Standard response pattern.""

""The Phobos is maintaining ECM field integrity,"" Khan added. ""Grey communication networks remain disrupted. They can't coordinate with the other platforms.""

""But they can still fight,"" Roarke observed.

As the Deimos and Damocles continued their swing around Callisto, the battle behind them intensified. The Phobos had positioned itself between Callisto and the Grey platform, its ECM suite creating a localized bubble of electronic chaos that prevented the alien vessel from sending distress signals to its counterparts.

""Lieutenant Commander Wei is requesting instructions,"" Major Vehlan reported from the tactical station. ""Our reconnaissance team is still in the Asteroid Belt. If Grey reinforcements arrive from the Jovian moons, they could be cut off.""

Gibson glanced at the holographic projection of Thorne, who nodded for him to proceed.

""Order them to maintain position but prepare for emergency extraction,"" Gibson directed. ""If the Grey battlecruiser shows any sign of movement, they abort immediately.""

Vehlan nodded. ""Understood.""

""Slingshot maneuver commencing,"" the navigation officer announced. ""Gravitational acceleration in three... two... one...""

The Deimos shuddered slightly as Callisto's gravity well caught the vessel, slinging it along a precisely calculated trajectory that would add thousands of kilometers per hour to its velocity without expending propellant. The maneuver was an elegant dance of physics‚Äîusing Jupiter's moon as a natural accelerator.

On the tactical display, the battle around the Grey platform escalated. The Phobos had closed to torpedo range, its forward batteries engaging the alien vessel's defensive arrays. Interceptors clashed with swarm craft in a chaotic melee of energy weapons and kinetic impacts.

""Phobos is launching Hyperion torpedoes,"" Khan reported. ""Three away... tracking toward target.""

The bridge crew watched in tense silence as the torpedoes streaked toward the Grey platform. Swarm craft attempted to intercept them, sacrificing themselves to protect their mothership. Two torpedoes detonated prematurely, their warhead clusters dispersing harmlessly in space.

But the third slipped through.

""Impact!"" Khan called out. ""Direct hit on the Grey platform's central mass!""

The tactical display showed the explosion blooming in silent fury. The Grey vessel's silhouette distorted, then fractured as cascading detonations rippled through its systems.

""Target neutralized,"" DEIMOS confirmed. ""Grey platform showing catastrophic structural failure. Power signature diminishing rapidly.""

A ragged cheer went up from several crew members before Roarke silenced them with a sharp look.

""No celebration yet,"" Gibson warned. ""Asoka just poked a hornet's nest. Khan, what's the status of the other Grey platforms?""

""Europa and Ganymede platforms show increased energy signatures,"" she replied after a moment. ""They're powering up. I'm detecting movement‚Äîthey're adjusting position.""

""Tracking vector?"" Thorne asked, her holographic image flickering slightly with the transmission delay.

""Not toward us,"" Khan said, surprise evident in her voice. ""They're... moving toward each other. Maintaining orbit around their respective moons, but shifting to what appears to be a synchronized position.""

DEIMOS's voice cut in. ""Analysis suggests they are establishing a direct communication link to compensate for the loss of the Callisto relay. Probability: 76.3%.""

""That's why Asoka attacked,"" Gibson realized. ""She thought she could disrupt their network.""

""And did she succeed?"" Thorne asked.

Khan shook her head. ""Impossible to determine at this range. But the surviving platforms are definitely altering their behavior patterns.""

""Phobos is resuming course to rejoin the fleet,"" the tactical officer reported. ""They've sustained moderate damage to their port side armor and lost at least four interceptors, but main systems remain operational.""

Commodore Thorne's holographic projection straightened. ""Open a channel to Commander Asoka.""

After a moment, Asoka's face appeared alongside Thorne's in the holographic display. Her uniform was smudged with smoke, and a cut above her eye leaked blood that she hadn't bothered to wipe away. Despite this, her eyes blazed with fierce satisfaction.

""Commodore,"" she acknowledged. ""Mission accomplished. The Callisto platform has been neutralized.""

""That wasn't your mission, Commander,"" Thorne replied, her voice dangerously quiet. ""You directly violated orders and endangered this entire operation.""

""With respect, ma'am, I saw a tactical opportunity and took it. The platform was vulnerable, and its destruction creates a gap in their surveillance network that we can exploit.""

""Or you've alerted them to our presence and given away our technological capabilities before we engage our primary target,"" Thorne countered. ""Resume formation with the fleet immediately. Consider yourself on probationary command status. One more deviation from orders and you'll be relieved, court-martial proceedings be damned.""

""Yes, ma'am,"" Asoka replied, not looking particularly contrite. The channel closed.

Thorne addressed Gibson next. ""Colonel, your assessment of our tactical position?""

""DEIMOS, analysis,"" Gibson prompted.

""The destruction of the Callisto platform provides a 17.2% improvement in our approach vector by eliminating one observation point,"" the AI replied. ""However, it has increased alert status across all detected Grey vessels by an estimated 43.7%. The battlecruiser in the Asteroid Belt has not yet shown a response, but probability of increased defensive posture is 89.6%.""

""So we've traded stealth for speed,"" Gibson summarized.

""An accurate assessment,"" DEIMOS confirmed.

Thorne considered this. ""Maintain course for the Asteroid Belt. All ships at maximum acceleration once the slingshot completes. If we've lost surprise, we'll have to compensate with speed."" She paused. ""Colonel Gibson, I'll expect revised tactical options in light of these developments within the hour.""

""You'll have them, Commodore,"" Gibson confirmed.

# [October 22, 2037 | 0800 Hours GMT | Post-Slingshot Trajectory]

Strike Group Aether Lance emerged from Callisto's gravitational influence on a high-velocity trajectory toward the Asteroid Belt. The Phobos had rejoined formation, though it maintained a noticeable distance from the other vessels‚Äîa physical manifestation of the tension now pervading the fleet.

Gibson stood in the OSTRC command node aboard the Deimos, surrounded by holographic projections of Commodore Thorne and her senior staff aboard the Damocles. The sophisticated quantum-encrypted communication system created such realistic representations that it almost felt like they were all in the same room.

""The situation has changed,"" Thorne began without preamble. ""Colonel Gibson has prepared revised tactical assessments based on our new strategic position. Colonel?""

Gibson stepped forward to the main tactical display. ""The Phobos's action has altered our timeline. Whether that proves advantageous or disastrous remains to be seen, but we need to adapt.""

""The Grey battlecruiser hasn't moved,"" Khan reported. ""Our reconnaissance team reports no change in its energy signature or alert status.""

""That doesn't mean they haven't been warned,"" Thorne pointed out.

""Agreed,"" Gibson said. ""We have to assume they know we're coming. DEIMOS, display the revised assault plan.""

The AI updated the tactical display. ""Based on current variables, a direct assault approach now offers the highest probability of success. The Phobos's ECM capabilities have proven effective against Grey communication systems. I recommend positioning it as a forward electronic warfare platform to blind the battlecruiser's long-range sensors.""

""And when swarm craft are deployed?"" Captain Chen from the Damocles asked.

Thorne turned to Major Vehlan's hologram. ""Major, your assessment?""

""My interceptors engage with drone support,"" Vehlan replied confidently. ""We've seen that our ECM can disrupt their coordination. If we maintain the jamming field, their numerical advantage becomes less significant.""

""The reconnaissance team's data gives us good targeting solutions for their hangar bays,"" Gibson added. ""We hit those first, reduce the number of swarm craft they can deploy.""

Thorne nodded. ""What about our Hyperion torpedo payload? We have a limited supply.""

""We concentrate fire on their main power distribution nodes,"" Gibson suggested. ""DEIMOS identified six critical junction points. One torpedo per target should be sufficient to cripple them if we get them through.""

""Assuming they haven't adapted their defenses based on what happened at Callisto,"" Commander Rodriguez, Thorne's XO, cautioned.

""Which is why we'll need a modified deployment protocol,"" Gibson countered. ""Specialist Khan has already begun working with DEIMOS to develop escort drone patterns for each torpedo. The Hyperion's warheads are our best chance against their armor, but they need to survive long enough to reach deployment range.""

Thorne studied the tactical display thoughtfully. ""Time to intercept?""

""At current velocity, we will reach optimal assault position in 43 hours,"" DEIMOS responded.

""That gives us less than two days to prepare,"" Thorne concluded. ""Colonel Gibson, continue your work with Specialist Khan on the torpedo modifications. I want a detailed briefing on the drone escort protocols by 0600 tomorrow.""

""Yes, Commodore,"" Gibson acknowledged.

""Captain Chen, coordinate with Captain Roarke to synchronize our approach vectors. I want precision alignment for maximum defensive coverage,"" Thorne continued. ""Commander Rodriguez, prepare contingency extraction protocols for our reconnaissance team. If this goes sideways, I want those pilots to have a clear path home.""

As the officers acknowledged their assignments, Thorne addressed the entire group. ""This isn't a drill or a simulation. We're about to engage the most powerful enemy vessel humanity has ever faced. I expect every department, every officer, every crewmember to perform at their absolute best. Dismissed.""

As the holograms flickered out, Thorne's projection remained a moment longer, addressing Gibson privately. ""Your honest assessment, Colonel. Not what you think I want to hear.""

Gibson considered carefully. ""The Phobos's attack succeeded, but at a potentially significant cost. Commander Asoka may have compromised our primary mission.""

""But?"" Thorne prompted.

""But we've confirmed our ECM technology works against Grey systems. We've proven we can destroy their vessels. Those are valuable data points we didn't have before.""

""Can we win this engagement?""

Gibson met her gaze directly. ""We have a fighting chance. Better than we did when we shipped out.""

Thorne nodded. ""Good enough. Make sure those torpedo modifications work. They may be the difference between victory and annihilation.""

Her hologram faded, leaving Gibson alone with his thoughts.

# [October 22, 2037 | 1400 Hours GMT | Engineering Section, USS Deimos]

In the ship's cavernous engineering bay, Khan and a team of specialists worked to modify the Hyperion torpedoes. Unlike conventional weapons, these devices were marvels of hybrid technology‚Äîcombining human engineering with reverse-engineered Grey systems. Each torpedo contained a cluster of smaller warheads designed to penetrate alien hull materials and disrupt their unique power distribution networks.

Khan studied the holographic torpedo schematic floating above the workbench. ""DEIMOS, run simulation KAPPA-7 again. I want to see the drone formation during countermeasure response.""

The projection shifted, showing a torpedo surrounded by five escort drones in a pentagonal formation. As simulated Grey defenses engaged, the drones adjusted position dynamically, intercepting incoming fire and creating shifting blind spots in the defensive grid.

""Escort integrity holds for twenty-seven seconds in worst-case scenario,"" DEIMOS reported. ""Sufficient for torpedo transit in 82.4% of projected engagement profiles.""

""Not good enough,"" Khan muttered. ""What if we reassign two drones to purely defensive protocols? No offensive capacity, just deflection and jamming?""

The simulation updated, showing the modified formation. ""Escort integrity improved to thirty-six seconds. Success probability increases to 91.3%.""

""Better,"" Khan nodded. ""Implement the changes.""

As she worked, Major Vehlan approached. ""How's it coming?""

""We're making progress,"" Khan replied without looking up. ""These modifications should give the torpedoes a fighting chance against their defenses.""

Vehlan watched the simulation cycle through another iteration. ""My pilots are calling it 'The Black Lance.'""

Khan glanced up. ""What?""

""Your modified torpedo formation. The way it moves through space‚Äîlike a spear thrust. One of my interceptor pilots started calling it 'The Black Lance' during simulations. The name stuck.""

Khan allowed herself a small smile. ""I like it.""

""You should,"" Vehlan replied. ""It's the most innovative weapons platform I've seen. Combining offensive and defensive systems in a single coordinated package‚Äîit's not how we've traditionally approached space warfare.""

""We've never fought a space war before,"" Khan pointed out. ""Traditional approaches are irrelevant.""

""True enough,"" Vehlan conceded. ""My pilots are running attack simulations based on the reconnaissance data. The Grey swarm craft are unlike anything in our training scenarios‚Äîthey don't maneuver like aircraft or spacecraft should. They change direction without apparent inertia.""

""Artificial gravity manipulation,"" Khan explained. ""We've suspected they use localized gravity fields both for propulsion and combat maneuvering. Our interceptors can't match their agility, but your pilots have the advantage of creative thinking. The Grey swarm seems to operate on programmed tactical patterns‚Äîeffective but predictable once you identify the sequences.""

""That's what we're counting on,"" Vehlan nodded. ""Pattern recognition and counter-programming. DEIMOS is helping us develop response algorithms that can predict their movements based on initial approach vectors.""

""And if they change their patterns?""

""Then we adapt or die,"" Vehlan said simply. ""Just like any battlefield.""

# [October 23, 2037 | 0200 Hours GMT | Colonel Gibson's Quarters]

Gibson sat at his desk, reviewing the final assault plan on his secured tablet. Sleep had eluded him, as it often did before major operations. Instead, he channeled his restless energy into methodical preparation‚Äîchecking and rechecking every detail of the coming engagement.

A soft chime announced a visitor. ""Enter,"" he called.

Dr. Nathan Harper stepped inside, carrying two mugs of what smelled suspiciously like real coffee‚Äîa luxury in space.

""Thought you might be awake,"" the xenobiologist said, offering one of the mugs to Gibson. ""Perks of being the science officer. I get to bring my own supplies.""

Gibson accepted the coffee with a nod of thanks. ""Couldn't sleep either?""

""Not likely,"" Harper replied, settling into the chair opposite Gibson's desk. ""First confirmed alien combat engagement in human history? I'll sleep when I'm dead‚Äîwhich, granted, might be sooner rather than later.""

Despite himself, Gibson chuckled. Harper had always had a morbid sense of humor‚Äîa common trait among those who spent their careers studying potentially hostile extraterrestrial life.

""What's on your mind, Doc? Besides imminent mortality?""

Harper took a sip of his coffee. ""I've been analyzing the data from the Callisto engagement. The Grey platform's response patterns, their swarm tactics‚Äîthey're consistent with what we've observed in smaller encounters, just scaled up.""

""That's good news, isn't it? Means our tactical models are sound.""

""To a point,"" Harper agreed. ""But there's something else. The platform didn't attempt to retreat or evade once it was under attack. It committed fully to defense, even when destruction became inevitable.""

Gibson frowned. ""You think it was sacrificial? Meant to delay us?""

""I think it was following programming,"" Harper clarified. ""I don't believe these platforms are fully autonomous. They're extensions of a larger consciousness‚Äînodes in a distributed network. The battlecruiser in the Belt may be the local command center, but even it might be responding to directives from somewhere else.""

""You're suggesting a hive mind?""

""Not exactly,"" Harper said, leaning forward. ""More like a highly centralized command structure with very little individual initiative allowed to subordinate elements. It's efficient for coordination but creates exploitable weaknesses if you can disrupt the chain of command.""

""Which is what Asoka did, intentionally or not,"" Gibson realized. ""By destroying the Callisto platform and disrupting their communications, she forced the others to adapt without higher approval.""

""Exactly,"" Harper nodded. ""And they defaulted to a predictable backup protocol‚Äîdirect line-of-sight positioning for communication. It's almost... bureaucratic.""

Gibson considered this. ""So the Greys might be less adaptable than we feared? More bound by procedure and protocol?""

""At the tactical level, yes,"" Harper agreed. ""But that doesn't make them less dangerous. A predictable enemy can still kill you if they have superior firepower.""

""Point taken,"" Gibson acknowledged. ""But predictability gives us an edge we didn't think we had.""

""Just don't expect it to last,"" Harper cautioned. ""The Grey's technological advantage means they can afford to be methodical. They've been studying us for decades‚Äîthey know we're creative, unpredictable. If we start winning, they'll adapt.""

Gibson nodded. ""Then we need to make sure our first strike counts."" He paused. ""I should brief Commodore Thorne on your analysis. This could influence her final tactical approach.""

""I'll prepare a formal report by morning,"" Harper agreed. ""Meanwhile, try to get some sleep, Colonel. Even OSTRC's finest need rest.""

# [October 24, 2037 | 0300 Hours GMT | Approaching the Asteroid Belt]

Strike Group Aether Lance decelerated as it approached the outer boundary of the Asteroid Belt. The massive field of debris stretched before them‚Äîcountless rocks ranging in size from pebbles to small moons, scattered across millions of kilometers of space. Somewhere in that chaotic tangle of stone and ice lurked their target.

On the Damocles bridge, Commodore Thorne stood at the command station, her posture rigid as she surveyed the tactical displays. The holographic projections of Gibson and Roarke stood nearby, their images transmitted from the Deimos bridge, reviewing final approach vectors with DEIMOS.

""All ships reporting ready,"" the communications officer announced. ""Phobos ECM systems online and calibrated. Interceptor wings prepped for launch across the fleet. All systems show green across the board.""

""Very well,"" Thorne acknowledged. ""Initiate stealth protocols. Passive sensors only. Minimum emissions profile.""

""Stealth protocols engaged,"" the tactical officer confirmed. ""We're running dark.""

Thorne nodded to Gibson's hologram, who stepped forward to activate the fleetwide command channel.

""All vessels, this is Colonel Gibson. We are commencing Operation Black Lance. Our objective is the neutralization of the Grey battlecruiser designated Target Alpha. This vessel represents an existential threat to Earth and all human civilization. Its destruction is not optional‚Äîit's imperative.""

He paused, meeting Thorne's gaze. She gave him an approving nod.

""We've spent decades watching the skies, tracking shadows, wondering when this moment would come. Today, we stop watching and start fighting. Today, humanity draws a line that will not be crossed. Execute your duties as you've been trained. Trust your teammates. Remember what we're fighting for.""

Thorne stepped forward, adding her own words to the channel. ""Strike Group Aether Lance, you represent the finest officers and crews Earth has to offer. You carry with you not just weapons, but the hopes and future of our entire planet. Whatever happens today, know that you have already made history by standing ready to face this threat. Commence approach. Good hunting.""

The fleet moved forward in perfect formation, gliding into the vast field of tumbling rocks and ancient debris. Each vessel maintained minimal power signatures, using the natural cover of the asteroid field to mask their approach.

""Intercept path locked,"" the navigation officer reported. ""Estimated time to weapons range: three hours, seventeen minutes.""

""Status of Target Alpha?"" Thorne asked.

""No change,"" Khan's voice came through the comm, transmitted from her station on the Deimos. ""Still maintaining position. Energy signature continuing to rise at established rate.""

""And our reconnaissance team?"" Gibson asked.

""Lieutenant Commander Wei reports all units intact and in observation position,"" Vehlan responded. ""They've gone to minimum power to avoid detection. Ready to provide targeting support when needed.""

Gibson looked to Thorne. ""Recommend the reconnaissance team hold position until the engagement begins, then fall back to safe distance. They've completed their primary mission.""

""Agreed,"" Thorne confirmed. ""Relay the order, Major Vehlan.""

""Yes, ma'am,"" Vehlan acknowledged.

As the fleet penetrated deeper into the asteroid field, the tactical display updated with precise tracking of nearby masses. The ships navigated with methodical precision, threading through the dangerous debris like needles through a constantly shifting maze.

""Entering optimal ECM range in thirty minutes,"" Khan reported. ""After that, the Phobos can begin targeted jamming operations.""

Thorne checked the time. Just under three hours until they reached firing position. Three hours until humanity fired its first deliberate shot in an interstellar war that had been silently brewing for nearly a century.

The weight of history pressed down upon them all‚Äîevery officer and crew member acutely aware of the stakes. All the classified briefings, the covered-up encounters, the people who had disappeared or returned changed. The cattle mutilations. The crashed craft. The decades of denial and conspiracy theories. It had all led to this moment‚Äîthis chance to strike back against an enemy that had treated Earth as nothing more than a laboratory and humans as specimens to be studied.

""It's quiet,"" Roarke's hologram observed, his voice barely above a whisper.

""It won't be for long,"" Thorne replied, her eyes fixed on the tactical display.

Gibson said nothing, but silently agreed. The coming storm would either mark humanity's first victory against the Greys‚Äîor its last stand.

A bit of context: it may not be the reason i feel this way but when i was a kid (10 - 12 or so) i got hit in the head by a crosssbar when i was playing football. It felt horrible, like an egg cracking, but no blood came out of my head, just a terrible headache, dizziness and i became a bit sleepy during that day. My mom never took me to the hospital, since i was good the day after the incident (no more headaches, no dizziness, just a bit of pain), but since then, i felt something inside me or, more specifically, in my head was missing.  
Since i entered the uni in my hometown its where i started to feel that in more of a way. I felt like each day of my life i become dumber and dumber. Its starting to scare me since im only 20 and sometimes i enter a room without any explanation more than i ""went autopilot"". Even one day i was holding a cup of coffee and, instead of washing it in the kitchen, i went to the fricking bathroom, and when i entered i realized i was being stupid and went on my day feeling dumb.

Other examples are that when i search for something, i take more than usual to find it, when form the very start it was at plain sight, i forget some words or things that i needed/wanted to remember and, this is one of the reasons i am scared, im slow to understand things, even though when i was younger i could understand anything, but now it gets more and more complicated, things like cooking, finances, politics, mechanic (something i like) and most importantly: programming, since the career im in its an engineer of systems, where programming is the most important thing of it, and i suck at it, even though before i wasnt that bad. It feels like my logic fails more and more with each exercise. You see, as i type now, ive been doing a practice job of multiple exercises of java, and i just did 3 out of 10, and the rest i just put them in chatgpt to just finish it all.

Honestly, the career im in isnt my thing, but it pays well and has a lot of opportunity jobs so i took it and i am regretting it, since i am in my 2nd year now and my parents dont want me to waste 2 years of my life in nothing. As i said before, i like mechanic (about vehicles), but unfortunately its not in the uni im in now.

Apart from the uni topic, im not a very productive person, i always say i will do things that can better my life or just do the things i have to do (chores, uni things, etc.), but i always end up stuck to my phone in bed, scrolling through youtuve shorts, and even though im conscient about it, i just continue until its too late, realizing now that i wasted my entire weekend doing nothing. Just ruining my mind and my sight.

Idk if its for my exesive use of my cellphone or for something beyond my power, but it is affecting me and i am getting sick of it. If anyone went through something similar, please tell me how to stop feeling like this and how to cut the cycle of doing nothing. Thanks for reading.",1,1742853210.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you‚Äôve ever craved a delicious scoop of vegan ice cream but didn‚Äôt have an ice cream machine, you‚Äôre in for a treat! With just four simple ingredients, you can whip up a creamy, dreamy frozen dessert that will delight your taste buds. Not only is this vegan ice cream recipe easy to follow, but it‚Äôs also incredibly versatile, allowing you to customize it with your favorite flavors.

Let‚Äôs dive right into creating your own batch of vegan ice cream without the hassle of specialized equipment. You‚Äôll be amazed at how simple it is to achieve that perfect creamy texture using just four ingredients that you probably already have in your pantry!

### Ingredients You‚Äôll Need

- 2 cups of frozen bananas
- 1 cup of coconut milk (or any plant-based milk of choice)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon maple syrup (optional, for added sweetness)

### How to Make Your Vegan Ice Cream

Now that you have your ingredients ready, follow these easy steps to create your own vegan ice cream:

1. **Prepare the Bananas:** If you haven‚Äôt already, peel and slice ripe bananas. Freeze them in a single layer on a baking sheet until solid. This step is crucial because frozen bananas provide a creamy texture that simulates traditional ice cream.
2. **Blend Ingredients:** Add the frozen bananas, coconut milk, vanilla extract, and maple syrup to a high-speed blender or food processor. Blend until smooth. If you prefer a softer consistency, add more coconut milk gradually until you reach your desired texture.
3. **Taste Test:** Give your mixture a taste. If you like it sweeter, feel free to add a bit more maple syrup. Blend again to incorporate any additional sweetness.
4. **Freeze and Firm Up:** Transfer your blended mixture to an airtight container. Freeze for about 2-4 hours to allow it to firm up. If you prefer a scoopable texture, try to let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes before serving.

### Variations to Try

This basic recipe opens the door to countless flavor options. Explore a few of these variations:

- **Chocolate Delight:** Add ¬º cup of cocoa powder to the initial blending step for a rich chocolate-flavored ice cream.
- **Berry Bliss:** Blend in 1 cup of frozen mixed berries for a refreshing twist.
- **Minty Fresh:** Add a few drops of peppermint extract to create a mint chocolate chip sensation.
- **Coconut Dream:** For an added coconut flavor, sprinkle in some shredded coconut or substitute some of the coconut milk with coconut cream.

### Tips for the Best Vegan Ice Cream

To ensure your vegan ice cream comes out perfectly, consider these helpful tips:

- **Storage:** Store your vegan ice cream in an airtight container to prevent freezer burn. It should last up to a week in the freezer.
- **Garnish and Serve:** Top your ice cream with fresh fruits, nuts, or a drizzle of chocolate sauce. This adds an extra layer of flavor and presentation.

A little backstory, I met M when I was 19 and she was 18 in our first year of university. We‚Äôre a part of the same society, so we would see each other a lot every week over the last 3 years. We‚Äôre both third years now and coming to the end of our degrees. I always thought she was cute and she‚Äôs honestly one of the kindest people in the world. She‚Äôs so talented and intelligent and always understands when I talk about stuff from my course (we do similar degrees) We‚Äôve been friends during our time here, and I realised I have feelings for her in October last year but it took me a while to get the courage to ask her out. Eventually, my friends helped me out. They told me to do it by text and one of my friends, L, drafted the message. Here it is:

‚ÄúHey, how‚Äôre you? I was just wondering what you‚Äôre up to at the moment if you‚Äôre free at all this week? I‚Äôd love to grab a coffee or maybe go and do something together if you‚Äôre free? 
I‚Äôve been dying to try [place], apparently they do great coffee, would love someone to go with!‚Äù

L assured me this had date connotations, as she would think a guy was asking her out with this. M responded and we arranged something for this week. We saw each other a few days ago, and she said she was looking forward to it since she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt see her friends outside society things‚Äù. I understood why she would think it wasn‚Äôt a date, since I reread the message and it seemed a bit ambiguous. My friends, including L, said I could still make it a date when we saw each other. But then, when we were messaging today, she suggested inviting a few of our mutual friends to join us. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what to do. She‚Äôs basically my dream girl but she doesn‚Äôt seem to want to date. We get along really well, and I feel like I‚Äôll regret it if I don‚Äôt take a chance. How do I get her to realise it‚Äôs a date without being aggressive or weird?

1jj2wlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jj2wlb/my_29f_fianc√©_29m_irish_goodbyed_me_at_a_bar_and/,My (29F) Fianc√© (29M) ‚ÄúIrish Goodbyed‚Äù me at a bar and is now acting strange. Advice?,"Sorry for the long post, as i‚Äôm trying to include all the details here. My (29f) fianc√© (29m) has been acting strange lately and I‚Äôm not sure what to do. 

This all started last weekend when we went to a very busy bar downtown. I was uncomfortable, as I typically don‚Äôt love packed bars such as this one. (Social anxiety) I expressed this to my fianc√©, and we ended up having some of his friends meet up with us. Things got a little better for me, as I consider them friends as well. After a while, I noticed my fianc√© wasn‚Äôt around us anymore and so I checked my phone. He had texted me 20 minutes prior and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs leave and get dinner‚Äù. I texted him to ask him where he was and there was no reply. After calling him a few times, he finally answered and said he was outside the bar and then hung up. He wouldn‚Äôt answer any of my other calls. I went outside and after looking for him in crowds of people, i finally found him across the street and down the street about a block. He was standing by himself on his phone. I was furious, and asked him why he left me/didn‚Äôt answer his phone, to which he said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt leave you‚Äù. I continued to ask questions until he just stopped talking. We didn‚Äôt talk for the rest of the day. 

While I recognize he didn‚Äôt completely leave me downtown, I was still shocked he even left the bar without having a conversation. It was really hard to find him and while I searched for him, I was alone and drunk in a sea of strangers. Also, I was getting another drink when he left the bar and I had asked if he needed one. He said no, but never said anything about leaving. 

Through the week, things kind of went back to normal although I did text him once about it more calmly trying to get clarity, and he never replied to my text. 

Fast forward to this weekend, he woke up and went to the gym while I slept in. He came back from the gym and found me awake but still in bed and he brought me a coffee, as he often does. I took my time to get up and once I did, I realized he wasn‚Äôt at our house anymore. I checked his location and found that he was driving around in our area. I watched as he went in circles until he parked about a mile from our house at a park. (We don‚Äôt frequent this park) He stayed there for about 30 minutes. I texted him and asked where he went. He never replied to my text. When he finally got home, I asked him where he went in a joking/chipper tone. (I tried to keep things light so I wouldn‚Äôt sound accusatory) And he mumbled that he was at the gym. And I said, ‚ÄúNo I mean after the gym‚Ä¶ you came home from the gym and then left, right?‚Äù. And he wouldn‚Äôt give me an answer. I got angry and when I continued to press he angrily said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I was just driving around‚Äù.

I‚Äôm not sure how to feel right now. It‚Äôs very odd behavior for him and we don‚Äôt typically keep anything like this from each other. It hurts to think that he might have wanted to get away from me‚Ä¶enough to drive around aimlessly for an hour. I‚Äôm totally okay with him having private time. A lot of time he goes into our guest room and shuts the door and I don‚Äôt bother him. It feels like something more is happening, but I just don‚Äôt understand what. I‚Äôm not the best communicator‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm working on. But it‚Äôs really hard to communicate with a partner that completely shuts down. 

I broke down crying yesterday about all of it. I explained to him that it makes me feel like I‚Äôm an inconvenience when he doesn‚Äôt respond to me and that he‚Äôs not acting like a partner. After a while, he did apologize for ‚Äúmaking me feel like he doesn‚Äôt care about me.‚Äù He said he does care about me and loves me‚Ä¶ but he still never gave me more context into why he left the bar or why he was driving around. When I asked about it again, he still said he doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it. 

I feel crazy. He wants to go back to acting normal but I just can‚Äôt shake that something is off. Any advice on how you would approach the situation would be greatly appreciated. ",12,1742852696.0,relationship_advice,11,0.93,False

1jj2tr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jj2tr6/i_dont_want_to_go_home_to_my_parents/,I don't want to go home to my parents,"I feel pathetic as a 21 year old who can't even stand up to my parents. They're overbearing, emotionally immature, and stubborn. I've been staying with my long distance partner for a few months and I'm the happiest I've been in a long time after leaving. My parents want me to come home in around 2 weeks but I don't want to.

They didn't listen to me or hear me out when I tried to express how I wanted to stay and now they've decided to rent a bigger place to have space for me. I feel like I cannot say no to coming home after they rented a space with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. I love my parents but their living style makes me depressed.

My dad cannot keep a place clean to save his life. When I visit other people's houses, I realize i have a very extreme view of what is considered messy. Most people think the average spill or a few clothes lying around is messy. To me that is nothing when you live with a man who has let a pile of sugar fall into the dishwasher and just left it there. There will be chocolate syrup stains on the cabinets, coffee stains on the doors, and spilt drinks in the fridge. 

My mother uses me as a crutch but can't seem to admit it. I'm like her ""little best friend."" She treats me more like a friend than a daughter. Calling me hundreds of times out of my room just to show me some terrible reality tv or waking me up to make me watch TV with her. She guilt trips me if I want to leave her room even after watching 2 hrs of tv by her side. She  tells me all her problems with my father and her life. I'm like a therapist at this point and my father eggs it on because he's not emotionally available for her. ""Spend time with your mother while I'm at work."" I feel like a 21 yr old child. 

I want to live, I want to work, I want to drive, i want to be by my partners side, I want a LIFE. They have never let me have a life that I want. 

Ive been crying everyday since my mom has told me about renting out the new apartment knowing I would have to leave my sweet partner and go back to my shitty life at home. ",1,1742852495.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

I just watched Polar (2019) with Mads Mikkelsen. I got the same vibes. I'm looking at recommendations on Google. Secret Window with Johnny Depp looks like it but I'd prefer if it was even less colorful. Needful Things too, I guess.

The checklist goes like this. The more checks, the better!

\_ Depressing shit cold cloudy weather  
\_ Lots of smoking and coffeeeeee  
\_ Policeman sipping coffee  
\_ Badass trench coats, puffer jackets, or wind breakers  
\_ Neck ties and suspenders  
\_ Everyone's got bad hair day.  
\_ Nature scenes, woods and lakes.  
\_ Deadpan humor. No upbeat energy.  
\_ Good music too, I guess?  
\_ Wholesome female character (need not be protagonist)  
\_ Drama element  
\_ Muted color palette

It need not be American. I'm open to other country's movies. I hope to get a lot of Eastern European recommendations!

It could be a horror, a thriller, a crime, a romance, a drama, or even an action so long as it has that anemic sleepy vibe. I wanna get cozy and watch my sleepy-eyed and depressed MC have coffee while thinking about thinking about thinking, or maybe reflecting on the murder they committed some something ago while Dark Was The Night starts playing in the background. *Tyooommmnaya noochhh*

1jj2snv,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1jj2snv/equipoise/,Equipoise,"We are people without seams,  
woven from cosmic silk,
and the warp in the fabric waits to be revealed‚Äî
unmoved,  
yet shifting everything,  
an unhindered and continuous inner monologue
about millions of suns rising
for millions of different people, simultaneously.

Again, I died easily.  
She bought a ticket to watch.

A stomach full of grayscale butterflies,  
bankrupt kisses, penniless phone booths,  
and walls painted with love poems‚Äî  
other easy and harmless confessions of love.

An oil slick in the sky,  
and under its shadow,  
I form my identity,  
squeeze it into a name,  
and every day convince myself. 
that I can drown in the glass of water she serves me.

She walks between the tables,  
coins in her purse rhythmically following her steps,  
my gaze follows the sound of her rhythm,  
her thoughts follow her interests,  
the first table requires more attention,  
the second table requires more honesty,  
I greeted her,  
she asked me which table I‚Äôm sitting at.


And I,  
I don‚Äôt come home after a night shift,  
a lonely morning coffee before I start,  
and two more glasses swallowed
in the company of meaningless conversations,  
and in the end, back to the pubs.  
Each visit feels like returning‚Äî. 
back to the pubs, for even more meaningless conversations,  
in the company of Swedenborgian dreams
and self-sufficient feelings.

Just before the end, we stand‚Äî. 
poorly preserved people in front of dirty ashtrays. 
and piles of drunken books.  
Our transcendence has made our inaction an endless journey.

And I share my thoughts with silence.  
Silence never condemns.  
Sharing is easy, and selfishness is invincible,  
it becomes my lost guide,  
all the ink in my head is not enough to finish this journey.  
Silence always meets me halfway.

Reckless, alone at rush hour,  
my hair will soon turn metallic,  
I will become dull iron,  
as I write in circles,  
a boring pencil scratched in a poorly lit toilet,  
in front of the dark mirror.  
I am not the one I thought I was.

And I paint the mirror‚Äî. 
blue, like my day,  
or her eyes that gave this color to my day.  
Grey, her,
a poem that fell in love with a stranger.  
And since then,  
we have spent all our nights,  
trying to find a way out of it
before our dreams starve.

I asked her,  
""Have you seen how thin the moon becomes
when it dips into the sea at night?""

Drops of water, unsalted,  
my own dance of rain always out of rhythm.  
I told her,  
""Don‚Äôt lose sight of the moon.""

We smoked midnight cigarettes‚Äî  
playing between our fingers,  
like burning buildings,  
and with them, we burned our stories.

From a book, the pages dived off the windowsill.  
With her feet on my shoulders,  
I will stop drowning,  
with her words in my ears,  
the pounding in my head will stop,  
with her thorns,  
I will stop bleeding.

Reckless,  
I stand on the windowsill,  
balancing,  
slowing time,  
stealing breaths from each memory.

I got someone fired from their job over a latte.,"I (30F) went to a local coffee shop this morning and I ordered a latte as I always do to start my morning. When I got it it was WAYYYY too milky for my taste. We are talking like 80% milk (and I don't even think it was the right milk. It tasted more like whole milk, I only like 2%). While I get coffee almost every morning I would say I'm not a huge coffee snob. I just noticed that it was off today. I politely told the teen working there (couldn't be older than 18) that the coffee had too much milk and I calmly asked if he could fix it for me. Not rude or demanding at all, just calm.

When I told him that my coffee was wrong, he seemed flustered and apologized. But I felt like he wasn‚Äôt really paying attention and kind of brushed me off. I mentioned it again to him with more sternness in my voice just to make sure he understood and then he finally said he could remake it but seemed visibly annoyed. Why? All you had to do was remake a latte. Even with that I figured it was fine and I went to wait for my drink to be replaced.

Out of the blue the manager came out from the back and took the coffee and she started making a huge scene about how the staff needs to be more attentive. I assume she heard me nicely request that the coffee gets remade? She then fired the kid on the spot in front of everyone. Which was making the whole situation way more dramatic than it needed to be. I was in complete shock that she did that. She was pretty harsh about it and the kid put up a fight but left after giving me a nasty glare as he walked out.

I didn‚Äôt expect that kind of reaction at all. I thought I was just asking for a very easy and quick fix. I just wanted a new latte. I feel bad that it turned into him losing his job. I‚Äôm not sure if the kid was always just lazy and a bad worker or what but the manager‚Äôs reaction felt way over the top to me.

So, AITA for complaining about my coffee and causing this situation?

TL;DR: I complained that my latte had too much milk and the manager ended up firing the teen on the spot in front of everyone. Now I feel bad but I didn‚Äôt expect that to happen.",0,1742852355.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,5,0.5,False

On these grounds.,"We have been in a relationship for almost 2.5 years now. A few days ago, when I was going through my Zomato app(his Zomato account was logged in on my phone), I wanted to change the location in the app and found an address saved under his ex‚Äôs name. He had the addresses of his other friends as well because many people used his account. There was an order placed under his name at his ex‚Äôs place. I definitely knew something was up. Though I knew that he had not met her personally, when I asked him about it, he said that she had called him almost three months ago. He told me that he mentioned his sister had cleared a government banking exam, so she jokingly asked for a treat, saying, ""Ab toh party banti hai."" So he ordered her a treat. When I asked him about this, he told me that he forgot to tell me about it. Forgot? How can somebody forget to tell something like this to their partner?He did say sorry to me.Later, he also said that he was telling me this now only because I brought up the address issue first and then asked about the order. I mean, of course, I already knew that he had placed an order at her address. He clarified that he had not cheated, which I believe for several reasons. But still, it‚Äôs a big thing.

One more incident happened almost a year ago when he called me and said that his ex had contacted him and was asking him to meet her, just to catch up. He asked me if I had any problem with that. I furiously said, ""Yes, go and meet her."" He definitely knew that I was angry. After an hour, when I called him, he told me that he had gone to meet her at a nearby cafe and had only met her for 10‚Äì15 minutes over coffee. I was shattered, but I did not break up because, at that point, I think I was naive and thought that since he had asked me initially, it was okay. Stupid me!I know that he has not cheated me but this is kind of a moral cheating. 

Now, the thing is, both of us are preparing for UPSC, and we have a pretty good level of preparation at this stage. I don‚Äôt know if I should break up with him now or just maintain the status quo until the exam so as not to ruin my preparation.

[Friendship] [Relationship]","I recently drove six and a half hours to the state of Kentucky, and had a strange experience in the mountains of North Carolina. I-40 was closed at a certain part, a fairly common occurrence after the devastation that Helene caused, and it forced me on a detour through a beautiful scenic route. It has me a bit shaken to be honest.

I passed by the town of Hot Springs where the French Broad River had carved its length through the mountainside, shaping an idyllic town around its natural splendor. The winding roads took me far above the water, and for almost half an hour I twined around its measure. It has me a bit poetic to be honest, but I feel like it's important to describe how it made me feel in the moment. I've been thinking about it ever since. 

I'm not religious, or even particularly spiritual. I don't have tattoos, I've never drank or done drugs - that drive was the first time I've even had a full cup of coffee to stay awake on the road. But the more I think about that moment of wonder, the more disturbed I become. I've come to believe that through my narrow experiences, I've lost something important, and I need help finding it.

Information about me:

* I'm 22M, I'm fairly skinny. I have dark brown eyes and hair, I struggle to smile in photos, and I try to go biking at least once daily. 
* I enjoy video games such as World of Warcraft or CRPGs like Pillars of Eternity & Planescape: Torment. I'm happy to hear about your favorites
* My other hobbies include the aforementioned biking, I run D&D weekly, I have a renewed interest in nature (as you might have guessed), and I'm trying to take more road trips.
* I live in rural South Carolina, I'm a leftist in a very right wing state. Kindred spirits are appreciated. 
* I have a lovely tuxedo cat named Bean

I am open to the following relationships:

* Platonic relationships with either sex
* Romantic relationships with women

I have the following opening questions, answer as many as you like - or none at all:

* What is something you believe in, and fight for?
* Where is a place you want to return to?
* What about the world around you makes you feel hope?
* What about the world around you makes you feel despair? 

The person I'm looking for (platonic):

* I want to talk with somebody who is, in this very moment, passionate about something. I don't care what it is - but I want to know everything about it.
* I have no interest in adult conversations, I want to learn something you care about. 
* Being open to short bursts of conversation might be ideal, but I'd like our discussions to have a communicated ending rather than just being left open ended. 

The person I'm looking for (romantic):

* As I mentioned I'm a straight man, so keep that in mind
* I prefer someone fairly active and healthy, I'm not perfect but I make an effort to stay in reasonable shape, I expect that of any romantic partners as well
* We should share SFW pictures fairly early to make sure attraction is present, I don't think either of us want to waste time
* I hope that you yap a lot because I sure do

I hope that this post is at least a little interesting, I know it's a bit strange. If you're interested in talking to a guy in nature driven crisis send me a chat or DM :)",1,1742852191.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

I-40 was closed at a certain part, a fairly common occurrence after the devastation that Helene caused, and it forced me on a detour through a beautiful scenic route. It has me a bit shaken to be honest.

I passed by the town of Hot Springs where the French Broad River had carved its length through the mountainside, shaping an idyllic town around its natural splendor. The winding roads took me far above the water, and for almost half an hour I twined around its measure. It has me a bit poetic to be honest, but I feel like it's important to describe how it made me feel in the moment. I've been thinking about it ever since. 

I'm not religious, or even particularly spiritual. I don't have tattoos, I've never drank or done drugs - that drive was the first time I've even had a full cup of coffee to stay awake on the road. But the more I think about that moment of wonder, the more disturbed I become. I've come to believe that through my narrow experiences, I've lost something important, and I need help finding it.

Information about me:

* I'm 22M, I'm fairly skinny. I have dark brown eyes and hair, I struggle to smile in photos, and I try to go biking at least once daily. 
* I enjoy video games such as World of Warcraft or CRPGs like Pillars of Eternity & Planescape: Torment. I'm happy to hear about your favorites
* My other hobbies include the aforementioned biking, I run D&D weekly, I have a renewed interest in nature (as you might have guessed), and I'm trying to take more road trips.
* I live in rural South Carolina, I'm a leftist in a very right wing state. Kindred spirits are appreciated. 
* I have a lovely tuxedo cat named Bean

I am open to the following relationships:

* Platonic relationships with either sex
* Romantic relationships with women

I have the following opening questions, answer as many as you like - or none at all:

* What is something you believe in, and fight for?
* Where is a place you want to return to?
* What about the world around you makes you feel hope?
* What about the world around you makes you feel despair? 

The person I'm looking for (platonic):

* I want to talk with somebody who is, in this very moment, passionate about something. I don't care what it is - but I want to know everything about it.
* I have no interest in adult conversations, I want to learn something you care about. 
* Being open to short bursts of conversation might be ideal, but I'd like our discussions to have a communicated ending rather than just being left open ended. 

The person I'm looking for (romantic):

* As I mentioned I'm a straight man, so keep that in mind
* I prefer someone fairly active and healthy, I'm not perfect but I make an effort to stay in reasonable shape, I expect that of any romantic partners as well
* We should share SFW pictures fairly early to make sure attraction is present, I don't think either of us want to waste time
* I hope that you yap a lot because I sure do

I hope that this post is at least a little interesting, I know it's a bit strange. If you're interested in talking to a guy in nature driven crisis send me a chat or DM :)",1,1742852144.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

My second novel was going well and then my wife and I decided to have a baby. So, I put the novel on the back burner to focus on being a rad dad. I'd done about 2/3 of it.

And like that _clicks fingers_ it's been 5 years.

All good though. No dramas there, I've focused on painting, music and other less which time intensive artistic endeavours in the meantime.

Then, while working on my goals for 2025 earlier this year, I decided to *trumpets play* resurrect my novel!

""Goal 3 - Revisit _name of novel_ and make a bloody plan.""

So, I revisited my research, characters, story planning etc. I soon made progress on a structural issue that was holding me back and low and behold, I got some momentum.

I was humming along, writing daily, ticking off the ""Odds and sods to do list."" I managed to size the task of finishing it off which was a big step. I was happy because I have often found it hard to create habits and maintain momentum. I was doing it!

And then one morning, I spilt a cup of coffee on my laptop. I just knocked it over and the WHOLE cup of coffee went into it. It sucked it up like a chamois. _fzzt-tzz-tzt_

As I've found it hard to get into habits this was a major annoyance. I wanted to be gutted and mopey and frustrated and I felt myself beginning to let this be an excuse not to crack on. So, instead, I laughed it off as a ""classic me"" type thing.

Solution: I took to using dirty old pen and paper to get the work done. What a revelation!

The new laptop arrives tomorrow (thanks to insurance) and work will continue on there again. But, it has been nice doing it the old way for a while. It was useful to change it up and experience the flow of writing in a different way.

Things I learned along the way

1. Don't be a berk and spill coffee on your laptop
2. Pen and paper works just as good as a laptop and may help your creativity 
3. Goal setting works - who would have thought?
4. My writing was far better than I remembered it being and I had forgotten how much work I had put in
5. Watch your excuses - are they valid? New baby? Yes. Being a baby about a broken laptop. No.",2,1742852030.0,writing,4,1.0,False

I got someone fired from their job over a latte.,"I (30F) went to a local coffee shop this morning and I ordered a latte as I always do to start my morning. When I got it it was WAYYYY too milky for my taste. We are talking like 80% milk (and I don't even think it was the right milk. It tasted more like whole milk, I only like 2%). While I get coffee almost every morning I would say I'm not a huge coffee snob. I just noticed that it was off today. I politely told the teen working there (couldn't be older than 18) that the coffee had too much milk and I calmly asked if he could fix it for me. Not rude or demanding at all, just calm.

When I told him that my coffee was wrong, he seemed flustered and apologized. But I felt like he wasn‚Äôt really paying attention and kind of brushed me off. I mentioned it again to him with more sternness in my voice just to make sure he understood and then he finally said he could remake it but seemed visibly annoyed. Why? All you had to do was remake a latte. Even with that I figured it was fine and I went to wait for my drink to be replaced.

Out of the blue the manager came out from the back and took the coffee and she started making a huge scene about how the staff needs to be more attentive. I assume she heard me nicely request that the coffee gets remade? She then fired the kid on the spot in front of everyone. Which was making the whole situation way more dramatic than it needed to be. I was in complete shock that she did that. She was pretty harsh about it and the kid put up a fight but left after giving me a nasty glare as he walked out.

I didn‚Äôt expect that kind of reaction at all. I thought I was just asking for a very easy and quick fix. I just wanted a new latte. I feel bad that it turned into him losing his job. I‚Äôm not sure if the kid was always just lazy and a bad worker or what but the manager‚Äôs reaction felt way over the top to me.

So, AITA for complaining about my coffee and causing this situation?

TL;DR: I complained that my latte had too much milk and the manager ended up firing the teen on the spot in front of everyone. Now I feel bad but I didn‚Äôt expect that to happen.",0,1742851636.0,AITAH,16,0.43,False

human disputes increase exponentially as distance between individuals decreases, they are inversely proportional. so as people become closer they have more fights. ths is not difficult to reason; if you only have to work with someone you argue about the copy machine and coffee maker. if you live with your coworker you argue about the copy machine, the coffee maker, the butter, hair in the drain, snoring, coughing, shower time, speaking volume .......and on and on. now throw in raising kids, religion, sex - each one with 10,000 chances to argue and disagree.

we see this play out in Robert Owens New Harmony community, as one resident wrote:

>

""We had assured ourselves of our unanimous devotedness to the cause and expected unanimity of thought and action: but instead of this we met diversity of opinions, expedients and counteraction entirely beyond anything we had just left behind us in common society: and the more we desired and called for 'union' the more this diversity seemed to be developed; and instead of that harmonious co-operative we had expected, we found more antagonisms than we had been accustomed to in common life. We differed, we contended, and ran ourselves into confusion: our legislative proceedings were just like all others, excepting that we did not come to blows or pistols; because Mr. Owen had shown us that all our thoughts, feelings and actions were the inevitable effects of the causes that produce them; and that it would be just as rational to punish the fruit of a tree for being what it is, as to punish each other for being what we are: that our true issue is not with each other, but with causes.""***""***

Specifically, being very sensitive such that you become so irritable and uncomfortable from even half-caffeine coffee, when you could tolerate regular amounts in the past. 

It seems to make symptoms much worse and creates a feeling of immense anger and unrest at low amounts. Wondering if this is common. I know many will probably say, ""just stop then"", but I feel I have too many variables in motion right now to add that withdrawal on top of it voluntarily. And not entirely certain the caffeine is the cause (which is why I am posting). 

**As a side note, for some reason, even hearing others say the word ""coffee"" or talk about caffeine infuriates me.

1jj29e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1jj29e5/successful_prep_and_results_on_second_try/,Successful prep and results on second try,"Hello everyone, this is a follow-up to a previous post of mine (I deleted the account and now have this one):

https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1hia7bu/my_experience_incomplete_exam_bc_of_insufficient/

I‚Äôll try not to go into too much detail again, but the short of it is that I had my follow-up colonoscopy today (a Monday at 9:30 am), I was cleared out this time (‚ÄúA+‚Äù prep my doctor said), and I‚Äôm very thankful no polyps were found and that I don‚Äôt have to do another procedure for ten years.  I truly sympathize with those of you who have had abnormalities discovered and/or have to do repeated colonoscopies. 

I met my doctor in February to discuss plans for the next try.  She asked if I have constipation and honestly I didn‚Äôt know ‚Äì I am ignorant about these things and my whole life have simply gone to the bathroom without knowing what‚Äôs normal or not.  I told her all of the things I did to prep as mentioned in my prior post.  For this next try, she instructed:

-	5 days before procedure, take a rectal suppository one night, and then again the second night
-	Starting 5 days before procedure, start taking daily one capful of Miralax with 8 ounces of water/juice/coffee
-	Starting 5 days before procedure, follow the low-residue diet for 3 days
-	For 2 days prior to procedure, follow clear liquid diet
-	Again follow Suprep protocol as I had done the first time

Things have been hectic and the procedure prep week kind of snuck up on me.  Here‚Äôs what I actually did:

-	Forgot about the suppository and didn‚Äôt realize it until too late
-	Forgot about Miralax during the week before and didn‚Äôt realize it until too late
-	Started low-residue diet on Monday (7 days before procedure, not 5); not much of a cook and basically ate white rice, white bread, American cheese slices all week
-	Stopped eating as of Friday around 9 pm (2 full days and change before procedure); just drank coffee (on day 1 of the fast) and water and Gatorade
-	Saturday night did [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXk-pqiy8n0&t=499s) Miralax with Gatorade prep (same extra prep I did last time), but without the Magnesium Citrate and forgetting to take second dose of Dulcolax; had one or two movements and got things going
-	Sunday 3 pm did first Suprep dose; this time made sure to drink the two additional 16 ounces of water and stand up and move around more
-	Sunday 7 pm or so did another round of Miralax with Gatorade prep with remaining Gatorade I had; I believe I did both doses of Dulcolax (before and after drinking the Gatorade)
-	Sunday 9:30 pm or so drank the 10-ouce bottle of Magnesium Citrate
-      Monday 3:30 am tried second Suprep dose; unfortunately I didn't have any Gatorade left as a ""chaser"" and tried powering through without holding holding my nose as well, and it got to me and I threw up a few times; after that I ended up finishing maybe 4 ounces of the mixture (out of 16 ounces)

	
Thoughts/observations:

-	Like before, I never had an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù and needed to run to the bathroom (except for the vomiting episode), but if I felt like I needed to go I did; the first time I was grossed out by pooing liquid, but now I knew that every time I did, I was making progress, so I made myself go
-	After a week of low-residue diet and a longer liquid diet/fast I was still surprised how brown my stool was at first and not confident I would get to where I needed to be; however, each after a few movements I could see the color starting to change
-	I had expected the Magnesium Citrate to really pack a punch, but it didn‚Äôt really make me go and I ended up going to sleep or trying to without getting up to go
-	I probably should have asked my doctor ahead of time about adding in the Miralax with Gatorade prep (especially doing it twice) and Magnesium Citrate; I was somewhat concerned I‚Äôd be doing something too dehydrating or otherwise dangerous
-	I made more of an effort to drink water throughout the day before the procedure
-	My last bowel movement was sometime early morning after the second Suprep dose; it was yellow but pretty clear and no sediment I don‚Äôt think; I still was worried going in if I had done enough because it seemed kind of like what I had gotten to before my first procedure, but in the end it worked out
-	I drink a lot of coffee and probably should have weaned off of it a bit before avoiding it altogether the day before; I think I had withdrawal symptoms from that, and just overall fatigue (from lack of good sleep and pooping as well)
-	I was much, much less nervous about the actual procedure and even looking forward to being put to sleep; I felt a lot more nervous about whether the prep was successful and of course the results of the scan

I really appreciate this forum and everyone‚Äôs contributions. It‚Äôs been a real help and source of support!",1,1742851110.0,colonoscopy,0,1.0,False
1jj28nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/amiwrong/comments/1jj28nx/am_i_wrong_for_gaming_with_a_woman_who_is_my_type/,"Am I wrong for gaming with a woman who is ""my type""?","
My gf and I have been together for years with no big issues. We had some talks about what we like and what we don't like.

Basically, my gf knows I had a thing for taller blondes. I guess I still do, but it's not like I howl at any tall blondes I see. I've told my gf this, that above anything at all, my gf is my top type.

Now, I have a new co-worker, we don't have a huge office, so we interact a lot. And well, she's a tall blonde. I won't deny she's attractive, but I have no intention of ever hurting my gf.

I told my gf about my new co-worker. She got a little worried, and I assured her she's all I needed.

So my new co-worker and I, along with two others from the office, went out for drinks. I found out the New Coworker (NC from now on) is a gamer  like me. We started playing Marvel Rivals together recently, and my gf has gotten really jealous. I wouldn't say we play a lot together, like 1-2  hour sessions once or twice a week. My gf doesn't like video games at all, btw. Also, we don't play alone, at least not all the time, I have a buddy who joins us from time to time.

My gf says I'm spending so many hours gaming with NC, and I reassured her that we are just gaming, and I still find her (my gf), the most attractive girl ever. My gf has gotten snippy with me recently when she caught me playing. I told my gf she's being unfair because I only really play when she's asleep or when she goes out with her friends, and I never say anything about it. 

I will admit, NC is the first female friend I made who likes to game, and it has been fun playing with her. 

Recently, I asked my gf if she wants to meet NC over drinks or coffee. But she says she doesn't want to see me get coffee with a woman who's ""my type"".

1jj2490,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/1jj2490/got_fired_for_being_aggressive/,Got Fired for being 'Aggressive',"I (22F) recently started working as a Sales Negotiator at an estate agency, despite having no prior experience‚Äîmy background was in finance and admin. From my second week, I knew it wasn‚Äôt for me, but I decided to stick it out to see if things would improve.

Weeks passed, and I found myself dealing with constant patronizing remarks, misogynistic comments (such as being told how I should dress to appeal to male clients), and uncomfortable discussions about my manager's political views. By week four, I had mentally checked out.

To be clear, I‚Äôm a soft-spoken, conflict-avoidant person. I tend to stay quiet to keep the peace, even when setting boundaries would be the better option. I‚Äôm aware of this and working on it. I don‚Äôt yell, I don‚Äôt lash out‚ÄîI try my best to keep my emotions in check.

The job has even brought me to tears. The week before my holiday, my manager was completely unavailable‚Äîhe spent eight hours a day, five days in a row, *leaflet dropping*. Meanwhile, my director told me she had a 2:30 viewing to attend. She left the office at 2:20, then at 2:27, called me to say, ‚ÄúCan you do it instead? I‚Äôm off for a coffee with my friends.‚Äù I had barely any time to gather notes and couldn‚Äôt even find the property. I ended up breaking down in my car. When she returned to the office later, she was completely aloof and just laughed off the situation, saying, ‚ÄúOh, I missed your call‚Ä¶ haha.‚Äù

This morning, after a week off, I returned to work with a bad feeling. As I walked into the office, I even Googled something like, ‚ÄúIs it normal to not feel refreshed after a holiday?‚Äù It was 8:50 AM. My manager was already in, but he didn‚Äôt acknowledge me‚Äîno small talk, no ‚ÄúHow was your holiday?‚Äù Nothing.

Then, exactly at 9 AM, he asked me to step into a private room. He told me I come across as aggressive, confrontational, and intimidating. He claimed that the director is ""too scared"" to talk to me because I always look and sound furious. I tried to make light of it, joking, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had a resting bitch face my whole life‚ÄîI get that a lot.‚Äù But he insisted it was more than that.

When I asked for an example of my so-called confrontational behaviour, he pointed out that when given a directive, I tend to respond with a simple ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm neurotypical, but I also don‚Äôt see the need to fluff things up unnecessarily. If someone asks me to do something, I acknowledge it and get on with it. Do I really need to say, ‚ÄúOh absolutely, that‚Äôs no problem at all!‚Äù every time?

I didn‚Äôt argue‚ÄîI just wanted to leave. Thankfully, I had an interview on Saturday, so I wasn‚Äôt planning to stick around anyway. I‚Äôm not even angry‚Äîmostly relieved. But I can‚Äôt help but wonder‚Ä¶ if I were a man, would they have used words like ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù and ‚Äúconfrontational‚Äù?

I genuinely reflect on my actions, and looking back, I can‚Äôt think of a single moment where I was aggressive or even slightly rude. Maybe I was a bit short at times‚Äîbut that‚Äôs what happens when you‚Äôre working in a frustrating environment with little support.",11,1742850759.0,UKJobs,12,0.74,False

I'm a (21m) and I tried to visit my (25f) online friend for the first time but I have a over protective helicopter parent that had my device with life 360. They would not let me meet anyone from online because they only think I'm going to have intercourse with them or die which is an understandable point. But I tried to formaly have my family meet my (25f) friend and I've known her since July 2024. She's very sweet and someone I consider my close friend because they will be there for you through the difficult times you go through. But other than that my family ended up just messing up plans that I wanted to meet them for the first time. She's a person who's struggling to find a job and my family thinks I won't be safe with her at all. My friend is only a 2 hour drive away and I'm suffering massive anxiety to not disobey in a way and yes it's pathetic and I'm struggling to make a choice to go and getting my sister yelling and mother maybe disown me or stay and keep obeying and never meet my online friends till I move away.

Now here's the update, I have eventually hit my breaking point in November after my mother has gotten pissed off at me when I got home from overtime work on the weekend.  I didn't know my mom called so i missed her phone call i didn't call her back because i wanted time to get coffee and eat breakfast to wake up and calm down before imma get yelled at. My mother didn't know i was gonna do overtime but she had my life 360 location so she knows i go to work and get out of work. My mother really gets mad at me for not wanting to communicate with her for the miss call when i get home but also why I went to my family doctors to get a referral for a therapist. She was the reason im getting it in thw first place and than after she got fed up she got angry and decided to want to throw me out if we are not going to communicate or find a solution to all this. So i went to my bed room to shower and she followed me and blocked me trying to get out of my bedroom and from going to take a shower. I told her please i just want to take a shower and sleep after me waking up at 3 am and to get to work by 4 am and work till 11am. She gets more angry and said get my things and get out so i accepted at that point anf started to pack my things when she slams my door. She then comes back and said nevermind please talk to your sister i made a mistake of saying that to you i dont want you to leave. At that point i ignored her and continued to pack my things and when i finished i went to the front door and she processed to block me once more and said to not leave please i didn't mean it but to be honest i was over more of the back and forth stuff and left after she than let me go. After that I went to stay with my online friend and finally got to meet her and she's exactly as she was with me all the time when we played together with our groups and how we spoke to each other day and night. She took me in to stay with them over the holidays and new years when I didn't have anywhere else to go. My mother and family throughout the time first had constantly called telling me to come home saying she's sorry and telling me to speak with my sister which is someone I barely speak to because we also have communicating issues and just fight alot. Than processed to call my friend several different times and get other family members and family friends involved to constantly call my friend and harass her saying she would get into massive problems and cops would get involved. The weird part from this is that my family somehow had gotten my friends mother's phone number (for disclosure my friend helps to take care of her mother so she lives with her) and now constantly calls her number to get answers of my whereabouts and I had told them through text I do not want to talk to anyone i want my official space from all this drama and stress. The next day I thought everything might of died down a but cause the calls stopped but not I thought wrong. The police department for my town had been calling me several times now and my mom had tried to file a missings person report on me. I've told the cops several times im not missing im ok im not hurt and told the cops of where I'm at exactly but my mother does not take no for an answer. She is a very prosistant latina mother so she looks for several ways to get to me and try to snap me out of my so called mind controled state. They have came to my job, tried to use my niece as a way to speak with me, tried to sue me for my truck im paying off, tried to cut off my phone line and several other things which will be in part 2 coming soon.

He does not like it if anyone is close to my mom even if it‚Äôs a relative. And then to see these texts. It broke my heart. I anyways don‚Äôt share the best relationship with him, and he does not compliment my mother. Ever. And now to see him flirting left and right with another woman. (She has been in my house btw). I am an only child I don‚Äôt know what to do or who to share this with. I don‚Äôt know if my mom know about this(cause she is pretty secure and chill) I am just hurt.

You should ABSOLUTLY take a shower before getting into the pool for multiple reasons:

\-The more impurities you bring into the pool, (bio matter, dirt, sweat, ect.) the more chlorine that needs to be in the pool to properly sanitize. Also the filters need to work harder to remove the sanitized dirt to reduce your total disolved solids (TDS) that are in the water. Less TDS = cleaner and clearer water.

\-as everyone will know, chlorine and bromine are terrible for your skin and hair. if you pre-saturate your hair and skin with fresh water, you will absorb less of it. This wont matter if you're in there for like an hour... but still...

diagnoses:
- rosacea
- no-burp (= retrograde cricopharyngeus dysfunction)
- IBS (although the ENT that diagnosed no-burp doubts IBS is present)
- ADHD
- suspected Raynaud‚Äôs (just a verbal ‚ÄòI think it‚Äôs Raynaud‚Äôs‚Äô by my GP)

- pantoprazole 20 mg daily (since august 2023)
- Vyvanse/Elvanse (lisdexamfetamine) 30 mg daily (since July 2024)
- Nebido Testosterone injections 1000mg/4ml once every 10 weeks (since march 2023)

My most concerning issue is random weight-loss. January 1st 2025 I weighed 65,3 kg (143,96 lbs) & the 28th of February I weighed 59,7 kg (131,6 lbs). My weight seems to have been relatively stable since the end of February. I have NOT been skipping breakfast, lunch and dinner, I did notice I didn‚Äôt feel the need to have any snacks or desserts anymore (which is different from before). Due to the fact that exercise makes me feel miserable physically (see explanation below), I‚Äôve barely exercised the past couple of months (which likely explains the loss of muscle mass I‚Äôve also noticed).

I had already lost about 6 kg between February 2024 and December 2024, which was intentional; I had just had a double mastectomy and finally felt comfortable enough with my body (mentally) to start exercising a bit more. To be completely honest, I didn‚Äôt even really try that hard to actually lose weight (I didn‚Äôt even intentionally exercise once a week consistently), so I was already surprised I managed to lose 6kg over that time period; let alone losing about the same amount WITHOUT trying and without wanting to lose more weight (I was happy with where I was at already). 

I‚Äôve noticed that lately, my heart rate shoots up when doing minor exercise (like a relaxed 5 minute commute by bike on flat ground gets my heart rate above 180bpm consistently, sometimes even hitting 200bpm), and stays elevated (above 100bpm) for up to a few hours afterwards. My baseline resting heart rate before the minor exercise is 65 bpm, so the contrast feels quite extreme. I also often feel very miserable during and after exercise. I usually get out of breath very quickly, my heart starts pounding in my neck, and sometimes I start to get lightheaded as well (I have never fainted or come close to fainting though). Furthermore I‚Äôve gotten nauseous quite a few times after exercise. These issues started about 5 months ago (I‚Äôve always struggled with breathing properly during exercise though; especially through my nose). 

Apart from that, I‚Äôve been struggling with excessive fatigue for about a decade. I basically always wake up tired, and I feel consistently drained and heavy during the rest of the day. It seems to be getting progressively worse; it‚Äôs really impacting my capacity to think straight lately, the brain fog has been a huge daily struggle. Nothing changed in my sleeping habits; I almost always sleep for a minimum of 8 hours, fall asleep instantly (within a minute after putting my head down), and I HAVE to set an alarm to wake up at a reasonable time (chances are I wake up at 4 pm if I forget to set one).

I also have a long history with gastrointestinal issues. Ever since being a child, I‚Äôve had frequent stomach aches. It‚Äôs honestly gotten a bit better after I‚Äôve started testosterone and my menstruation has stopped. 
In terms of stool, I notice that lately I‚Äôve been having an increased amount of mucus in there again (I also had this in 2021, but then it was much more extreme; back then it also ‚Äòleaked out‚Äô when I was just walking around, that‚Äôs not the case now). Also, sometimes when I flush the toilet, my stool sticks to the sides. 
Furthermore, I started experiencing daily heartburn about 3 years ago. It got so bad that it woke me up at night multiple times a week and that OTC drugs just weren‚Äôt cutting it anymore, hence the pantoprazole prescription from my GP; this is definitely working. I‚Äôve tried to quit them again (just because I‚Äôd rather not take anything unnecessarily), but without success. 

The past year I‚Äôve started experiencing joint pain more often as well; especially my ankles and my wrists have been bothering me. The pain usually lasts a couple of days up to a month, and then disappears until coming back again.

I‚Äôve also been sick very often ever since being a kid; I catch a virus every other month, if not every month.

I‚Äôve been to my GP to talk about all of this and she ordered bloodwork. Despite my ferritin and folic acid being slightly out of range (low), all other tests were within range: ESR, Hemoglobin, MCV, Platelets, Leukocytes (including: Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, Basophils), Fasting Glucose, CRP, Sodium, Potassium, Creatinine, eGFR, GGT, ALT, Vitamin B12, TSH. My B12 did drastically decrease since 2021, likely due to pantoprazole, but it‚Äôs still in range. 
(Side-note; in 2021 my IgA was also below the reference range [0.7 - 4.0]: 0.47 g/L)

I really had to push my GP to refer me to a specialist; at first she wanted to send me home with supplements for B12 and folic acid, despite telling me that she thought they didn‚Äôt (fully) explain my symptoms (she didn‚Äôt recommend ferritin due to potential gastrointestinal side effects, instead she recommended dietary changes - which makes sense to me). Eventually I got her to refer me, and she decided on an ‚Äòinternist‚Äô (I‚Äôm Dutch, I have no clue whether this is also the correct English word). 

It‚Äôs great I got referred, BUT the first possible date I can get seen is the 7th of May. Do you think it‚Äôs okay to wait that long, or should I really be pushing to be seen earlier? 

Doctors usually don‚Äôt take me seriously, so I‚Äôve kind of started to believe the ‚Äònothing‚Äôs wrong‚Äô, but at the same time everything in me is screaming ‚Äòsomething is DEFINITELY wrong‚Äô; I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, some perspective from an outsider would be greatly appreciated! 

Also, my psychiatrist told me it‚Äôs unlikely that these symptoms are due to side-effects of Vyvanse, mainly because they‚Äôd be fairly atypical and because the timeline doesn‚Äôt fully add up with the date I started and changed doses etc. 

Sorry for the extremely long post!!

Side-note: I honestly have many other symptoms, but I struggle with figuring out what‚Äôs relevant to mention, so I‚Äôm just going to leave it at this. If there are any questions, I‚Äôm obviously happy to answer them. 

TLDR; can unexpected weight-loss of 5.6 kg (= -8,5% body weight), along with other (worsening) symptoms, wait till the 7th of May for a consult with an ‚Äòinternist‚Äô? ",1,1742849331.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I love that it allows me to do all the precision dialing-in, and then just have it remember those settings for the future so I don't have to use a scale at 6am every morning.

But I'm finding VERY conflicting advice on what a shot of espresso even is. I'm hours down the rabbit-hole, and it seems like you have to pick either ""third wave"" or ""Italian"" espresso, and they're completely different things.

Right now, the machine spits 18g of coffee into an IMS big bang basket. From my understanding that's considered a double. But to get the 1:2 ratio of 36g out, I'd have to select ""single shot"" as a ""double shot"" gives about 60ml. Which seems like it's both double the recommended strength of the machine and a common strength based on weight.

But I also see a lot of guides saying a double is 60ml, but that you need to be 1:2, and 14-18g of espresso -- but those things can't all be true. And I know to measure in weight, not volume, but I'd still like to understand the volume and why there are such big differences.

Is this just a third-wave vs Italian debate? And if so, how do I decide which to do?

Any advice / help would be very appreciated!

1jj1f71,https://i.redd.it/00h0nr559pqe1.jpeg,Reasons why our city and country are overwhelmed by neglect and litter,"Following a recent post about littering, I recalled an experience with those who should have been responsible for ensuring order but failed to do so.

While it is very atypical of British standards to acknowledge the elephant in the room, we must make an effort to say it loud and clear: the UK is not a clean and well maintained country, and Cambridge is no exception. The question is, why? There are always excuses, often weak and unconvincing, primarily revolving around the Council supposedly lacking funds due to various reasons. But is that really the case?

Cambridge is an expensive city, so one would expect at least the city centre to be well maintained. However, it is not. The reasons are multiple, but they can be grouped into three main categories:

**>> Lack of responsibility among state employees and corruption**: this is a well documented issue where public money, paid by citizens and businesses, is used for purposes other than those that would positively impact those who contributed. Why is there litter? Why are footpaths uneven? Why are dried wild plants not being cut? Why are damaged public railings left unrepaired? Some time ago, I saw a dead hedgehog on Castle street. It remained there for days until it became nothing more than a stamp on the pavement.

**>> Laziness of people**: Walk around the city and see for yourself. Now is the time to clean gardens, but for some, that responsibility is ignored. They expect others to clean their property. It is every homeowner's obligation to ensure that vegetation from their property does not interfere with footpaths or cycling lanes. Despite having access to roads with significant foot traffic, many properties look abysmal due to a complete lack of maintenance. The solution? The Council should fine these property owners repeatedly until they learn that they do not live in a jungle.

**>> Lack of education among some individuals**: Simply put, some people are incompatible with living in society. Day after day, garbage is thrown everywhere: food packaging, coffee cups, tyres, general rubbish, and even hazardous waste like asbestos. The Solution: Hefty fines and community service (or long prison sentences if necessary). However, this would only work if those in charge did their jobs properly. The current state of affairs suggests they do not.

One day, while heading to Milton Recycling Centre, I encountered an individual displaying this very lack of responsibility. He casually threw his coffee cup out of his car window without a second thought. Naturally, I attempted to report this via the online form at ""South Cambridgeshire District Council‚Äôs Envirocrime"" page. To my disappointment, the system did not allow me to upload video evidence. I tried compressing it, converting it into a GIF ...nothing worked.

Frustrated, I contacted them via email to ask why I was unable to upload video evidence. My message read:

*""I started a new form, but neither an MP4 file (6.82MB) nor its GIF conversion (9.05MB) were accepted. The webserver attempts to upload them, the loading bar disappears, and... nothing. On the other hand, a JPEG of 178kB uploaded properly. I have uploaded these files to Dropbox for you to review.""*

Their response:

*""I have raised this issue and have been informed that videos and GIFs cannot be uploaded to our forms. This may be something we consider adding in the future, but for now, only images and documents can be attached.""*

After all my effort, it was too much for me, and I replied with:

*""This is laughable. It seems this so-called Envirocrime report is just another way of wasting public money. I have video footage clearly showing garbage being thrown from a moving vehicle, yet I cannot use it as evidence. Even more ridiculous is that you don't accept GIFs, a format that has been around for over 30 years. The form states: 'Please provide as much photographic evidence as possible, as this helps with our investigation.' So next time, I should ask the offender to pose next to the garbage for a picture. Do you accept files uploaded to Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, Mega, OneDrive, etc.?""*

Unsurprisingly, I received no further response.

What can you do? What can you say? It's laughable.

Lucy had just spent her last twenty dollars on cafe food she didn't really need, while filling out applications she really had to in order to find a job she deperatly, no, uregently had to have.  she was nor never will be deperate. she had choices, right now it was find a job or make her ham and cheddar panini with iced mocha last for a month or starve to death. if it was going to be death then she was glad to have supported a local small business and not the golden arch or the double tail mermaid the yuppies and scoccer moms all loved.

what made this day even worse was the fact that she was turning 30 tomorrow.  

jobless, and alone at this age is not how she thought how her life was going to turn out. she was not desperate. she had options. she had gone to commuinity college to save money. the economy had plans like pac-man to slowly devour. her lower middle class status meant she didnt qualify for grants and she wasnt stupid enough to saddler herself with loans, but she wasn't top of the class enough for a scolarship at the time either. so she graduated started off the same as the rest but nothing made her stand out so she just coasted until now.

sitting alone, in the dim cafe/bookstore combo also made her rethink that maybe she should have gone to the new cat cafe instead. the couple serious relations ships she had were always nice. there was never really a spark like the movies and that was okay until it wasn't. ending amicably and not even being too upset.  she wasn't deperate, she had options and the cat cafe was just one step too close to being the crazy cat lady.

now that her ethically sourced sandwich was luke warm, she thought what exaclty she was going to do. nothing right now as she hit submit to what seemed like her 500 resume. her last job, managing a non profit thrift store had been going... okay for lack of anything else to say about it. her degree of business management had gotten her the job years ago. Lucy had planned to climb the ranks for a better job or branching out because soo many said that this is what adults do. go to college, get a job and work. the thrift store had its ups and downs and managed to stay afloat, god knows how, she had seen the books. but the old dinasuar of a store was finally calling it quits next week. not even giving her 2 weeks notice,.

she was not Desperate, she had options. just what they were at the moment. did not look good. so it was time to go to home and wake up tomorrow for the first day of junk removal at the shop. Happy frickin Birthday to Lucy.

of course it was raining. and not the gentle pitter patter on the widows that would have sounded somewhat soothing. no this was going back and forth bewtween a downpour and a monsoon. maybe today would get better, a shower and some coffee would do the trick. out of bed and getting her clothes for the day, a pair of khacki pants and button down blouse is her usual attire. she set them on the toilet and turned on the hot wate, as she waited the lights flickered on and off and then steadied. lucy knows she paid her bills for this month so it was probably the storm messing with the grid. nothing she can do about it so she got in, washed , shaved  and turned off the water. the entier bathroom was all fogged up, she had forgotten to turn the fan on. but the air felt a little too cold outside the shower curtain, so she snatched up her towel and covered herself. living alone had its perks but not at a time like this. it felt still and stale, too moist and dead like a basement that flooded everyspring. stepping on to the bath mat the lights shuddered again then began to hum this insesent noise that maybe dogs can hear. at the same time she felt like she had stepped in wet muddy grass, but it was just her rug had a very wet soggyness to it that would inicate her bathroom had flooded. that was not the case since everything else was dry. without the fan being on lucy noticed that it was too quiet. she couldnt hear any cars or neighbors in the building. until the rumbling. her blood ran cold and the lights shuddered again. what was going on. she could feel a shift had taken place but nothing in her imediate vacinity had changed, she was in her apartment in her bathroom doing her usual routine. well trying to and there it was again a rumble from either the corridor outside her appartment or.. or god fobid inside her apparrtment. stepping off of the soggy carpet, she put her ear to the door, breathing. whatever she sensed making her feellike prey was inside. it didnt sound like a person. it moved and rumbled sounding like a demonic tigger chuffing but getting further from the door. she grabbed her toothbrush, what the hell she was going to do with that she had no idea but it felt better to have something in her hands than nothing confronting what was out there in nothing but a towel.

she sould have called the land lord or the police. she had never thought someone or something could have gotten in. the lights still hummend it was starting to cause her to have a headache, he heart was beating so loud she was sure the thing could hear it. was it a better idea to open the door slow and peak out or fast so that lucy could startle the rumbling monster in the hallway.

slow was better, that was she might be able to close the door and hide back in the bathroom. she grasped the door hadle and began to turn. if the air wasnt mving before, whatever life it held just died. the thing in the hallway stopped. so did she, the lights flickerd and dulled. she held her breath listening for movement, nothing so she pushed to door open a crack her eye to the door. the rumble came again, this time she saw what was making it. a lizzard like creature was facing her currently it was standing on its rear legs no bigger than a large dog. its head whipped arouldn and it dropped to all fours. it must have smelled her or something . the sharp claws it had gouged into the side of the wall and it sprinted at her hissing as her brain was trying to process what was going on she took in the hallway she was seeing before slamming the door. at that moment the lights flared bright, browned out and the humming ceased. lucy took the breath she had been holding. 
the hallway wasn't her apartment. there were yellowed office walls, carpeted floors that looked moist where the thing had previously had stepped. the lights were those terrible overhead tubes that made noise in all hospitals and schools.
everything was a beige off color with water damged in the wallpaper. doors on either side as far as she could see.what the fuck was going on,.

she put her ear to the door praying that thing couldnt get through. after a minute of nothing she cracked the door again. nothing.  she decided to crack open the door one more time. her hallway stood before her as it normally was. brick on oneside with a window and a view toward her bedroom while the kitchen area was behind the door. the bathroom fog had cleared and the rug no longer was soaked as if someone had poured a gallon of water on it, she didnt know what was going on but lucy was going to be late for work. even though the humming had stopped her head still hurt and",1,1742849092.0,CreepyPastas,0,1.0,False
1jj1ef8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jj1ef8/im_38_and_finally_cracked_the_discipline_code/,I'm 38 and finally cracked the discipline code after failing for 15+ years. Here's the system that changed everything.,"I've failed at building discipline more times than most of you have tried. I've bought every planner, tried every app, tested every methodology. Most of what's taught about discipline is bullshit that looks good on Instagram but fails in real life.

After 15+ years of trial and error, here's what actually works:

The 2-Day Rule: Never miss the same habit two days in a row. This simple rule has been more effective than any complex tracking system.

Decision Minimization: I prep my workspace, clothes, and meals the night before. Eliminating these small decisions preserves mental energy for important work.

The 5-Minute Start: I commit to just 5 minutes of any difficult task. 90% of the time, I continue past 5 minutes once friction is overcome.

Accountability is highest form of self love. I joined an accountability group and other people helping me stick to my goals has been a life-changer. If you want to join, I left the invite in my bio.

Trigger Stacking: I attach new habits to existing behaviors (e.g., stretching during coffee brewing, reading while on exercise bike).

Weekly Course Correction: Sunday evenings are sacred for reviewing what worked/didn't and adjusting for the coming week.

This isn't sexy advice. It won't get millions of likes on social media. But after thousands spent on books, courses, and apps, these simple principles have given me more progress than everything else combined.

## Understanding Leather Types: Genuine vs. Faux vs. Bonded

When shopping for a leather ottoman with storage, you'll encounter different types of leather, each with its own characteristics and price point.Understanding these distinctions is crucial for making the right choice:

*   **Genuine Leather Storage Ottoman:** this is the highest quality option, made from the top layer of the animal hide. Genuine leather is known for its durability, natural variations, and luxurious feel. It's the most expensive option but offers the best longevity and aesthetic appeal.Pay close attention to the type of ""genuine leather"", full-grain being the highest quality.
*   **Faux Leather Storage Ottoman:** Also known as synthetic leather or pleather, faux leather is a man-made material that mimics the look and feel of real leather. It's a more affordable and often vegan-friendly choice. Faux leather ottomans are generally easier to clean and maintain but may not be as durable or develop the same patina as genuine leather over time.
*   **Bonded Leather Storage Ottoman:** bonded leather is made from leftover scraps of leather that are shredded and bonded together using adhesives. It's a less expensive option than genuine leather but also less durable. Bonded leather ottomans may not hold up as well to heavy use and are more prone to cracking or peeling.

1jj1brk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1jj1brk/am_i_the_jerk_for_snapping_at_my_nephew/,Am I the jerk for snapping at my nephew,"So for reference, at the time I was 35 years old, and I had always loved trucks when I was younger. I went to cab training, got a truck license, and started my own company. When my company was just getting off the ground, I had cheap Iveco trucks. Whenever I drove through Germany, I would always stop and visit my mom‚Äôs side aunt, who was living with my father‚Äôs side nephew. I don‚Äôt want to explain why, but that‚Äôs how it was.

Anyway, when I earned my first ‚Ç¨500k, I decided to treat myself to a truck. I took out a small loan of ‚Ç¨20k so I could afford a brand-new Scania 730S, one of the best trucks, at least for me. By the way, for those who don‚Äôt know about trucks, the ‚ÄúS‚Äù is the highest cabin trim, and the ‚Äú730‚Äù refers to the V8 horsepower.

So one night, while I was driving from Poland, I stopped to visit my aunt and nephew in Germany. We‚Äôll call my aunt Mary and my nephew Mark. For some reason, Mark would always be jealous of me because he couldn‚Äôt have expensive things, but I could. I stayed the night, and the next morning, my aunt and I were drinking coffee while Mark was eating breakfast. Since I bought coffee for Mary, I gave Mark the keys to my truck and told him to go get the coffee.

Now, everything went fine until we heard a loud crunch sound. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it, but it was loud. My aunt and I immediately ran outside and saw my truck in the middle of the road with the back of the trailer curled against a tree. I immediately ran to the truck, took the keys from Mark, and he ran to my aunt.

What I think happened is that when Mark got into the truck, seeing he had the chance, he either turned the truck on and put it in reverse, or he just released the parking brake. Anyway, I slowly put the truck back into my parking spot to assess the damage while my aunt was yelling at Mark. This was bigger trouble because I had a load, and the trailer wasn‚Äôt even mine‚Äîit belonged to my employer. After I locked the truck and we all got back to the house, my aunt asked me if I wanted a cigarette since she was a heavy smoker, but that‚Äôs not really relevant.

After she finished yelling, I yelled at Mark, and he finally got the courage to argue back. That‚Äôs when I snapped. He was 19, so he could face charges. I called the police and filed a report. My family said I shouldn‚Äôt do it because it was an accident, but I asked them, ‚ÄúHow does a 19-year-old accidentally crash a ‚Ç¨500k truck?‚Äù The truck had minor damage, but it was still damaged.

Before I filed the report, I got a call from my employer saying they pressed charges against him. I admit I did feel a bit sorry, but he did it on purpose. A few days later, I got an angry call from him asking how I could do that. I hung up. He ended up paying off the damages and covered the repairs on my truck.

However, it's about 4 years old, and I've run into a problem.  This morning I felt a tiny something in my mouth, thought it was a piece of grounds, turned out to be a tiny piece of plastic.  We have the glass carafe ""CD"" version, and the edge of the carafe is disintegrating.  I wiped a paper towel along the pouring edge and came away with several more plastic pieces.  This brewer gets one daily brew and a monthly dishwasher trip, with handwashing in between.  

Inspecting the other plastic pieces, basket, carafe lid, etc., it's all the same plastic and I now trust none of it.  I've never seen this with a drip coffee maker before.  My prior Bonavita, we used that 9 years, no issues.  Perhaps this is due to new plastic regulations?  I've never been excited about hot water and plastic.  The Technivorms seem to use less than others, but now this.

The Moccamaster replacement carafe is $50, and another $50 for the other plastic parts.  At the moment I've got my old Bonavita Carafe on it, so I have time to figure this out.  I want to either find glass and stainless parts or, failing that, swap out the coffee maker and just sell the CD.  I'm not overly concerned about cost.

For potential stainless parts, I've found a SS Bunn basket that will do the job, but the lack of a water distribution basket cover may be an issue.  I have my Bonavita 40oz all-glass no-plastic carafe that actually fits.  I can't seem to find an all-glass carafe larger than 40.

 The Grande CD is a flat-bottom round basket, and the Bunn SS basket is the same, with an extra \~6mm / 0.25"" diameter top.  I have a few metal rain head options I'm looking at too.  

Anyone done this before, any suggestions?",1,1742848855.0,Moccamaster,2,1.0,False

It doesn‚Äôt come with instructions so using a IR thermometer, I‚Äôve been trying to figure out a good workflow to get a halfway decent roast.  

On my first attempt, it was way under roasted.  I was too paranoid about not burning the beans so I think I roasted at too low a temp (250‚Äì300) for 20 minutes (yep, too long).  I made a pourover the next day (yes, I‚Äôm aware that I should let the roast sit for more days) and it was clearly under roasted.  It tasted very bland and had a wood/cardboard-like aftertaste. 

I did several more roasts at higher temps and for shorter times, each one improving dramatically in scent and flavor.  I was about to toss out the remainder of that first batch (about 35 grams left) but then decided to try to re-roast it just to see what would happen.  I got the roaster up to 350-400, took it off the flame while poured in the beans and vigorously agitated it for 3 minutes more, about 6‚Äù above a medium flame (gas stove).

That was last night.  This morning, after grinding the beans, I noticed the scent was MUCH more pleasant - light, fruity, rich.  Made a pourover and was shocked to find that it was actually quite good!!  If I HAD to criticize it or compare it to my ideal cup of coffee, I would say it was still a little on the bland side.  But I also accidentally added 25 grams more water than I usually do to my pourover.  Regardless, it was still VERY drinkable - miles better than the first cup from this batch.

Anyhow, just wanted to post a data point for anyone else who has ever under roasted their beans.  They CAN be salvaged.  I‚Äôm sure there are people who are going to downvote/criticize me, but try it first.  You have nothing to lose.  Perhaps I was biased because I had low expectations, but I genuinely think it turned out pretty tasty.  ",4,1742848815.0,roasting,3,0.7,False

Are you following a ketogenic diet and wondering whether Diet Pepsi fits into your low-carb lifestyle? Many keto enthusiasts wrestle with understanding which beverages are truly compatible with their strict dietary guidelines. While staying hydrated and enjoying occasional treats is important, not all diet drinks are created equal when it comes to maintaining ketosis. This comprehensive guide will dive deep into the world of Diet Pepsi and its potential place in a ketogenic diet, providing you with expert insights and clear information to help you make informed nutritional choices.

Understanding the Ketogenic Diet and Beverages

The ketogenic diet demands careful consideration of every food and drink consumed. Maintaining a state of ketosis requires strict monitoring of carbohydrate intake, typically limiting daily consumption to 20-50 grams. When it comes to beverages, the stakes are high, and seemingly ""diet"" options can sometimes contain hidden carbohydrates that might disrupt your metabolic state.

Nutritional Breakdown of Diet Pepsi

**Diet Pepsi Nutrition Facts**:
- Zero calories
- Zero grams of carbohydrates
- Zero grams of sugar
- Contains artificial sweeteners

Is Diet Pepsi Truly Keto-Friendly?

While Diet Pepsi appears to meet the basic keto requirements of zero carbohydrates, there are several important factors to consider. The artificial sweeteners used in Diet Pepsi, specifically aspartame, can have complex effects on metabolism and insulin response.

Potential Concerns for Keto Dieters

1. Artificial Sweetener Impact
2. Metabolic Responses
3. Long-Term Health Considerations

Insulin and Metabolic Responses

Some studies suggest that artificial sweeteners might trigger insulin responses similar to sugar, potentially affecting ketosis. Research published in the Journal of Nutritional Science indicates that certain sweeteners can impact glucose metabolism, which could theoretically interfere with ketogenic goals.

Hydration and Beverage Alternatives

While Diet Pepsi might be technically keto-compatible, nutritionists often recommend alternative hydration sources:
- Water
- Unsweetened tea
- Black coffee
- Sparkling water with natural flavors

Expert Recommendations for Consuming Diet Pepsi on Keto

**Moderation is Key**
Most keto experts suggest limiting Diet Pepsi consumption and treating it as an occasional treat rather than a dietary staple. Drinking water should remain your primary hydration source.

Potential Side Effects and Considerations

- Potential digestive discomfort
- Artificial sweetener sensitivity
- Minimal nutritional value
- Possible subtle metabolic impacts

Click here to learn more for a healthier you: https://customketodiet.myofferdeals.com

Scientific Perspective on Diet Beverages

Recent research from nutrition scientists suggests that while zero-carb beverages like Diet Pepsi don't directly disrupt ketosis, they might not support optimal metabolic health. The complex interactions between artificial sweeteners and human metabolism continue to be an area of ongoing scientific investigation.

Making an Informed Decision

Ultimately, the decision to include Diet Pepsi in your ketogenic diet depends on individual metabolic responses and personal health goals. Monitoring your body's reactions and consulting with a healthcare professional can provide personalized guidance.

Practical Tips for Keto Beverage Choices

**Best Practices**:
- Prioritize water intake
- Choose natural, zero-carb beverages
- Listen to your body's responses
- Consider occasional consumption of Diet Pepsi

Conclusion

Navigating the world of keto-friendly beverages requires careful consideration and personalized approach. While Diet Pepsi technically meets the zero-carb criteria, it's not necessarily an ideal regular beverage for those committed to a holistic ketogenic lifestyle. Balancing occasional enjoyment with nutritional awareness and prioritizing whole, natural hydration sources will support your long-term health and metabolic goals.",1,1742848693.0,customketodiet1,0,1.0,False

I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit but I just want to get this off my chest. My best friend for over a decade died of alcoholism about a year and a half ago. She was 29 years old and while I have a lot of peace now there is still so much I struggle with surrounding her death. Just for clarity liver failure due alcoholism is what's listed on her death certificate. So it's not like an ambiguous thing, her drinking is what killed her. However, that's also the part that I struggle most with. I had no idea, not even the slightest clue, that she was struggling with alcohol. 

We met as freshmen at college so drinking did play a decent role in our relationship. But I wouldn't say we drank any more excessively than our peers. Obviously she was drinking alot more than I knew about and probably for a lot longer. Still it makes me question so much of our time together. We did drink and go out but it all seemed normal in the context of college. We also lived together for 3 years even sharing a room our senior year. Still I had no clue that she might be drinking excessively. 

After we graduated we moved and grew a bit apart. We were still close but caught up in our daily lives. However as the years went on I saw her become less and less happy. I was really worried for her but also felt like I couldn't help her if she didn't want to help herself. Again I was completely oblivious to the drinking, I just thought she was depressed and I didn't know how to be there for for her other than to be her friend and keep showing her I cared. There was a tipping point tho, I'd gone to visit her and was really shocked at the way she and her partner were living. I knew she was not healthy. A couple of months later she came to visit me and honestly the weekend left me feeling like I needed to distance myself from her to protect my own heart. Looking back I regret this so so much. 

We stayed friendly as time went by. Texting regularly and calling each other occasionally. In fact I had just had a quick conversation with her when a few days later her partner messaged me that she was in the hospital and unlikely to make it. I was shocked especially when they told me it was due to liver failure. Because of her drinking she was unlikely to qualify for a transplant and ended up being too sick for one anyway. She died 3 weeks after being admitted. 

Later I helped her partner go through her stuff and there were remnants of alcohol everywhere. Little bottles of vodka hidden in her drawers and in cupboards. A coffee cup in her car filled with vodka. After a little looking around it became impossible to deny she really had been an alcoholic. I was so furious with her partner for not noticing and letting things get so bad. I was mad with myself for not knowing for all these years and for not being a better friend and I was (and still sometimes am) pissed at her for not confiding. It was clear at the funeral that she had really isolated herself over the years and that makes me so sad. I felt her push me away too and ultimately I let her. 

I miss her dearly and there is so much I wish I could do differently. In a lot of ways I feel like she committed suicide which I don't know if its fair to say. I talk about her often but always freeze up when people ask how she died because it doesn't feel like my secret to share. 

Is it common for people to hide their drinking so well or were we just oblivious? 

I guess I'm not really looking too much for answers because what answers are there? I just want to know if I really did let her down? Could I have done anything different? Should I have known?

He anticipated and admittedly looked forward to it, knowing there would be some news because once Volkov sank his teeth into the case, he would not let go until he cracked its bones. They had vastly different approaches to their morning routine: an early night, early wake up, a quick workout and a balanced breakfast for Schmidt and a short nap before sunrise accompanied by the last cigarette from the pack for his partner. Countless times had he had to send Volkov to the precinct bathroom to brush his teeth. It was a wonder his smile was always so bright and even, if rare, reserved only for Schmidt himself, when no one else was around.

\*I looked up the language. We‚Äôre fucked. There is no alphabet.\*

Michael put the cup on the table next to the omelette. He distinctly remembered seeing Chinese Alphabet for tattoos online.¬†

\*You sure? How?\*

\*Are you near? Bring me coffee\*

Schmidt wasn‚Äôt put off by the brash and inconsiderate tone of the message. But he also had learned not to humour his partner‚Äôs abrasive personality. Instead, he positioned the phone in a way that would capture his breakfast plate with the deliciously steaming coffee and snapped a picture to send as a reproach. It turned out good, but not good enough: he also had to show that he‚Äôs not even dressed yet, yet alone anywhere ‚Äúnear‚Äù. A flexed bicep and a meaty shoulder adorned the plate in the second picture, as if caught by accident.¬†

\*Not quite ready for the day, detective Volkov\*

The recipient saw the picture but failed to answer immediately which Schmidt took as an opportunity to enjoy his food in peace. The cup was half-empty when he did decide to double check that he hadn‚Äôt accidentally turned on the silent mode. To his disappointment, there was still no response, although it was good news: detective Volkov got the hint.

Just as the last drops of coffee left the cup, another text came.

Volkov‚Äôs desk was a mess. Well, more of a mess than usual. It was clear he had spent the whole night at the precinct, perhaps catching a little shut-eye on the sofa in the waiting area. Everyone was so used to his ways, barely any eyebrows were raised. His four monitors, screens covered in fingerprints from how often he forcibly poked them, showed a dozen open windows, pictures with foreign characters, screenshots, dictionaries. The desk itself wasn‚Äôt much better: he scribbled, printed out and doodled what seemed like a hundred indecipherable images. Schmidt approached their little office with caution as the hunched back of the detective meant he was deep in thought. The others‚Äô greeting smiles were sympathetic as they knew Volkov wasn‚Äôt in high spirits exactly.

‚ÄúTook you long enough,‚Äù he grumbled when the steaming paper cup landed on his left.

‚ÄúWe should open the window, detective,‚Äù Schmidt offered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to breathe in here. Can‚Äôt be healthy.‚Äù

This careful probing went well: Volkov went straight to the point.

‚ÄúSo apparently, the symbol we saw wasn‚Äôt really a character in Japanese OR Chinese, at least not a modern one. However‚Ä¶‚Äù

He extended his palm and hummed with satisfaction when an unopened pack of his favourite cigarettes landed onto it. With a practiced gesture, he tore the plastic and put one in his mouth. Schmidt sighed and opened the window to let in some air.

Volkov went on, ‚ÄúHowever, it‚Äôs something called ‚Äòa radical‚Äô, which is like a meaning hidden in a bigger character, you follow, Mikey?‚Äù

‚ÄúI follow detective,‚Äù Schmidt confirmed, even though it wasn‚Äôt very clear, but he knew his role now was to listen.

‚ÄúSo if there‚Äôs like a ‚Äòheart‚Äô symbol within another character, you know it must mean something about feelings or thoughts, right? Or ‚Äòstrength‚Äô means it‚Äôs about, like, skills or power,‚Äù the older detective shuffled his papers before putting up two big prints of simple-looking characters to show Schmidt. ‚ÄúProblem is, some of them look nearly identical even though they mean completely different fucking things. Say, Mike, do you see a difference between these two symbols?‚Äù

Schmidt did his best to compare the two before admitting, ‚ÄúA very small one. I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed it¬† if you hadn‚Äôt told me they were different.‚Äù

Volkov TSKed cockily, ‚ÄúWell, they are. This one means ‚Äòstrength‚Äô and the other one means ‚Äòknife‚Äô. And there are literal hundreds of those. If you put them together, you get a word, but god forbid you put them in the wrong order, then you get something else entirely.‚Äù

‚ÄúFascinating.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlso, not only do they go one after another, they can climb on top of each other, and do it in threes, fours and so on, pervy little bastards.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmazing.‚Äù

Volkov stopped in his tracks, as if realising something. He finally looked at his partner who was sitting on his own desk facing him, listening to his ramblings with a small fond smile. Schmidt took the opportunity to nod towards the coffee cup that was slowly losing its steam. Volkov obliged.

‚ÄúThe fuck are you smiling at? We‚Äôre fucked! The symbol on the note just means ‚Äògrain‚Äô,‚Äù he said, taking a gulp as if he was meaning to do it anyway. ‚ÄúIt must be just a random scribble, otherwise I don‚Äôt see how it fits the message written by the victim.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are being dramatic, detective Volkov,‚Äù Schmidt went. ‚ÄúI am pretty sure we can find someone who is fluent in Chinese. In fact, this morning I took a bus that went through our victim‚Äôs neighbourhood and saw a place with some characters on the facade. It‚Äôs actually just a block away from Vito‚Äôs apartment. I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs a Chinese or a Japanese shop, but someone there might have more information.‚Äù

Volkov squeezed the cigarette between his sharp canines ‚Äî ‚ÄúThen what are we waiting for? Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

\*\*\*

The place wasn‚Äôt just a shop. It was a *butcher‚Äôs.* The owner, a burly Asian man, was busy with a customer when they walked in, but gave them a friendly enough smile that invited to look around. Inside, the garlands of sausages and slabs of freshly-cut meat on hooks sat alongside Chinese decor that was so bright it hurt the eye. Red, gold and black rosettes, charms and statues took up every horizontal and vertical space. Lots of calligraphy that looked very similar to the symbol on the note dazzled their eyes from the scrolls and paintings. Schmidt and Volkov exchanged a meaningful glance. If anyone knew about these foreign characters, it had to be the man at the counter.

A sudden loud noise made them jump: the owner was using a huge axe to expertly separate a pork thigh from the rest of the leg while the other guest got out his wallet. In a matter of a couple of minutes, the butcher went through what seemed a small arsenal of gleaming instruments to cut up, chop and mince the part. As he did so, every section of the slab was carefully wrapped in some wax paper and packaged into its own bag. Volkov would have whistled if he could: it was a wonder the butcher‚Äôs fingers were left intact. Also, if anyone could really cut up a human body and put it into containers to be disposed of, it would be someone with a skill like this. Jim looked back at Schmidt and his heavy look showed he was thinking the same.

Finally, the customer left, all smiles and gratitude, the bags of meat hanging off of him like a Christmas tree.¬†

‚ÄúWelcome to Steve‚Äôs!‚Äù the man boomed, wiping his hands on a worn out but clean rag. ‚ÄúAre you looking for anything in particular?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are from the Bellenhaven police department,‚Äù Volkov said, flashing his ID. ‚ÄúJust a couple of questions, if you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù

Schmidt looked at his partner with a reserved surprise: he wasn‚Äôt known for being so courteous with‚Ä¶ well, anyone.¬†

Meanwhile, the said partner went on, ‚ÄúHave you heard of Vito Marino‚Äôs murder? It happened just around the corner a couple days ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure did,‚Äù the shopkeeper said. ‚ÄúHe was pretty famous, wasn‚Äôt he? I saw a TV crew having lunch across the road yesterday,‚Äù ‚Äî he nodded towards a small cafe on the other side of the street ‚Äî ‚ÄúBut no one came to talk to me about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would they?‚Äù Volkov asked.

‚ÄúBecause,‚Äù the man laughed. ‚ÄúVito was a regular. He would pop in every week or so, get some offal and chat for a bit. Would pay triple and leave a tip, too.‚Äù

Volkov scrunched his face ‚Äî‚ÄúOffal? Like, organs?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir!‚Äù the man said with another booming laugh. ‚ÄúI know folks dislike offal for some reason, but it makes a great soup! I make sure to clean the organs real good, especially the intestines. Vito told me he loved cooking it for his wife.‚Äù

Schmidt wondered if his wife appreciated the gesture.

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù Volkov managed. ‚ÄúCan I have your name, sir?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Steve!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are you from, Steve?‚Äù

A warning glance from Schmidt didn‚Äôt alarm Volkov in the slightest. He wasn‚Äôt the kind of person to care about offending people much. In fact, some of his interrogation tactics relied on putting people on edge so they would be less cautious and let something slip.¬†

Steve looked around the shop ‚Äî ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it obvious, detectives? I‚Äôm Chinese.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôve been living in Bellenhaven for‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAlmost forty years now,‚Äù was the answer. Schmidt noticed a note of pride in his voice. ‚ÄúMy parents were first-generation immigrants. I know, I know, most Chinese go to the US, but we settled here for some reason. Anyway, they‚Äôre dead now. I used the inheritance to open up this shop.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Volkov said. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs business?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt complain, really. I work with a dozen farms, they bring in the animals, sides or quarters, I cut them up in the back and store here. People love me because I never say yesterday‚Äôs meat is today‚Äôs, no, sir. And the pieces that I couldn‚Äôt sell in a day, I send back every morning.‚Äù

Indeed, Schmidt couldn‚Äôt see any fridges apart from the glass displays in the front or hear any tell-tale humming from the back.¬†

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you freeze the meat?‚Äù Schmidt asked.

Steve the butcher smiled and picked up the gleaming blades to wipe them with a cloth, ‚ÄúHave you seen the energy prices, detectives? I might be doing decent but the margins are razor-thin. I‚Äôm already paying a fortune to run the cooling displays. But they only keep the meat fresh for twenty-four hours.‚Äù

Schmidt didn‚Äôt fail to notice the way Jim‚Äôs hand almost imperceptibly darted towards the gun holster the second Steve picked up the cleaver.¬†

These lightning-sharp reflexes were one of the many things he admired in his partner.

Volkov was indeed a little wound up. The sleepless night and the caffeine in his blood were making him jumpy but not reckless enough as to actually get out the weapon. Not to mention, there was no real danger. However, something about this Steve was‚Ä¶ unsettling.

The butcher went on, none the wiser, ‚ÄúI send the leftovers back to the farms that supply it. No idea what they do with it but two-day meat isn‚Äôt fit for humans. They probably make animal feed with it.‚Äù

Schmidt used the opportunity to look more closely at the bright Chinese decorations while the other two men were busy chatting. He was scanning the calligraphy around the shop in search of something looking like the character on the note so he could pretend to be curious and not let Steve know they had seen it before. Never wise to let a potential murderer know what you know.

He distractedly wondered if him thinking of Steve as a suspect already was a gut feeling he wanted to trust.

As he browsed, a big imposing piece of furniture caught his eye: a richly embossed carved buffet cabinet, filled with delicate crockery: definitely something brought from abroad. The centerpiece bore a luxurious piece of wood carving with a single complex Chinese character assembled from what looked like a precious wood. Above, crimson-red banners hung, an indecipherable stream of black brushwork running down each of them.¬†

No use, he had better tune back into the conversation.

‚Äú... mister Marino would never be rude, no. Nothing like some *less generous customers,* ‚Äù the butcher was saying. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd chat about my parents, my sister, the shop. He was very interested in running a butchery.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas he, now?‚Äù Volkov asked. ‚ÄúWhy do you think he did?‚Äù

‚ÄúDunno. He was a businessman, too, yeah? Birds of a feather‚Ä¶‚Äù

Both detectives suppressed a doubtful hum.

‚ÄúRight,‚Äù Volkov agreed. ‚ÄúSorry, I never asked your full name. I suppose Steve is just a‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúFunnily enough, it‚Äôs really Steve, maybe because I was born here. Last name‚Äôs ‚ÄúHe‚Äù. My older sister, though, she has a proper Chinese name, haha!‚Äù

The butcher put all his instruments away neatly and got out two pieces of wax paper, ‚ÄúWould you care for a kilo of some fresh pork, detectives? I‚Äôll do 50% off for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, thanks!‚Äù both men said in perfect unison.

So I am at this point

\- PID factory reset

\- I turn on the machine and make sure to load the boiler

\- I can see the temperature raises, there‚Äòs a little dot on the temperature number and with the machine top opened I can see the SSR led on (my understanding is that this is on when the heating element get powered?)

\- Now this is the problem, even if I am in coffee mode the machine reaches something like 80c and then the little dot on the pid screen disappear, the SSR led is off but the thing keep getting hotter until it reaches 140c almost. Then it goes down to 120c and start to rise again. This happens regardless how which mode I select (coffee / hot water / steam). In theory coffee mode should stop at \~95c.

Hey everyone,

YouTube recently rolled out an update that broke just about every converter out there ‚Äî Kaizo included. Fortunately, I caught it quickly and managed to patch things fast enough to minimize downtime. Most of the core functionality is already restored and running smoothly.

That said, a few edge cases (especially some specific quality formats) might still fail occasionally. I'm actively working on refining the fix, and things should be fully stable again very soon.

Appreciate everyone‚Äôs patience and continued support ‚Äî and if something doesn‚Äôt work, feel free to retry a bit later while I tighten up the patch.",3,1742848020.0,SafeMP3,0,1.0,False

I went into little Vietnamese sandwich shop I was the only customer. The guy behind the counter looked like he was in his early twenties playing some old school music on his phone, casually dancing like there was noone else.

I asked for a b√°nh m√¨ and a hot tea. He told me I had solid taste and asked if I wanted it spicy. I said mild because I've never eaten there before. A few minutes later he brings me a sandwich and tea sits at the next table and asks if I've ever tried this with Maggi sauce? I shook my head, so he went back to the counter, grabbed a bottle and came back. Then he opened my sandwich and spilled this dark sauce all over it saying ‚ÄúTrust me game changer‚Äù. He wasn‚Äôt wrong it was good, it wasn't amazing but it was good. Anyway we ended up chatting for like 15 minutes about food and weather, random stuff. He told me his parents opened the shop in 2006 and that he's trying to continue with a family business. Before I left, he wrote down a list of three other things I had to try next time. 

Working in a foreign country, far away from home and on top of that not being a blobber I feel like it's so hard to make new friendships.

Unless it's also revealing something important about the truth scene. Unless...

  
***Unless it was Mari who lost it.***

I mean, yeah, no one wants to deal with their parents over spilling coffee and orange juice on the carpet, but the ""face turned red"" part seems to imply that this was pure rage rather than distraught.

Plus the way the Library excerpts were ordered seemed to imply that ALL the excerpts ARE somewhat important and relevant to the Truth. And if the Orange Joe Spill memory is no exception... *then it's because of Mari's surprisingly short temper which let's face it, would probably be even worse than teenage Aubrey's.*

And Mari's short temper mixed with a now shattered and irreparable $1,000 violin that she and all of Sunny's friends spent all summer saving money for via jobs?

I got tired of seeing the streets full of litter so I decided take 40 minutes out of my day to fill up 2 bags of trash from the Ballard streets (near breweries). It was a great activity for a rainy day and I know it isn't going to solve the core problems with trash in the city, but it will certainly reduce the eye sore/pollution that it causes.

**Context:**  
I went to Woodland Coffee in the morning for some light reading and coffee, shameless plug they have great coffee and a delicious squash bread. Upon parking on 54th I was greeted by trash all over the sidewalk and street in what would otherwise be a pretty nice area in Ballard.

Later that day I came back with a grabber, gloves, two trash bags and a podcast to listen to and started picking away. A guy who lived on the street asked if I was part of any organization and I told him that I wasn't, but I had some free time and was tired of seeing trash in the places that I frequently visit/run/bike by. But this got me thinking that I can't be the only person who is tired of seeing nice neighborhoods covered in all sorts of garbage. I decided to put together a Facebook page called¬†[Clean Seattle Collective (CSC)](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61574485267426) ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cleanseattlecollective/)) for people to follow the journey of getting litter off the Seattle streets.

*\*\*Disclaimer: I don't want or expect any appreciation for cleaning litter off the streets. My goal is to show that anyone can do it and it should be done out of motivation to see the city you live in look cleaner. The Facebook page is connect others to like minded folks who also see this issue in their neighborhoods and want to participate to the extent that they are able to in keeping seattle clean.\*\**

We had quite a few issues and we have both been working hare to improve upon these.

We've been intimate a couple of times since giving things another go in January, but I have explained multiple times, that I really want to take things slow to build a connection, and trust again. This was taken completely as intended, and things have been really good!

This past weekend, we had a wonderful time, went to a few events, walks and coffee dates, so yesterday morning we were cuddling in bed and I suggested MAYBE being Intimate that night.

She was really excited, and the day went on...We went and did some shopping, went on another really nice walk, I made dinner and then when it got close to 'that time', I had a shower and afterwards I was hit with a wave of fear and anxiety because I suddenly worried that the s*x might make things different, when they've been so good up until this point...

I called her in to th bedroom and explained this to her. She said ""that's cool, I get it, dont worry!"" Then she left the bedroom and went to watch TV, So I was relieved, and thought that was that...

About 5 minutes later l was drying my hair, and she comes back in to the bedroom and starts on a rant about how I let her down, I shouldn't have suggested doing it that morning if I was going to change my mind, if I say I'm going to do something, I should stick to that plan and not let her down, that were basically just like friends if we're not going to be intimate etc...

I was shocked, but tried to explain that I was just feeling a bit worried and insecureand asked if we could just talk and still have a cuddle in bed...

She carried on ranting and said, and I quote. ""Having a cuddle and talking is the last thing I'd want to do. I don't care!""

I was upset and walked away to the bathroom. I then hear the front door slam. She stormed out then text me saying not to contact her again.

I understand that she felt let down, but am I really the a**hole for changing my mind last minute?",1,1742847072.0,AITA_Relationships,4,1.0,False
