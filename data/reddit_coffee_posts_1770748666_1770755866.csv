For a little background, I started my firm late last year and I’m now in my second year of practice. I work in a pretty niche area and have been trying to connect with other attorneys in the same space to learn more and hopefully find some mentorship.

I’ve reached out individually to a handful of attorneys to see if they’d be open to grabbing coffee or lunch, but so far I haven’t received any responses. I’m not sure if I’m approaching this the wrong way or just catching people at busy times, but I’ll admit it’s been a little discouraging.

For those of you who’ve been in practice longer, do you have any suggestions on better ways to connect with more experienced attorneys in a specialized field? I'm feeling dejected lol. Am I going about it all wrong????",1,1770755521.0,solofirm,0,1.0,False
1r1c91t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1r1c91t/i_need_to_confess/,I need to confess,"Hello, 35M here,

First of all, English is not my native language, so I’m sorry in advance if this post ends up hectic or unreadable. 
It’s going to be a long one.
I’m at a point in my life where guilt, regret, and overall sadness are just overwhelming and crushing. I don’t want to share everything again with my family or friends; I feel like a stupid, inexperienced teenager at the moment, and they have already heard a lot. I figured that maybe if I post here, it will bring me some sort of relief. Let me share my story with you:

Back in July 2024, my girlfriend of 10 years (also 35, so let’s call her 35A) and I broke up. Sort of. It was very emotional and, from my perspective, came out of nowhere, but of course there were signs. In the end, she blamed me for many of our relationship problems and told me that essentially I was what I always feared I would become. When I heard that, I was devastated and heartbroken, but I also knew it wasn’t true. I wasn’t perfect, that’s for sure, but I also tried really hard to be better than my father, and I was sure I was doing a good job at that. But what if I was wrong? I just couldn’t stomach it. I tried to reason with her for 3 days, and finally we came to an agreement that we would separate for now and make a final decision in December. We would contact each other by phone, only once a month, and we were allowed to see other people. I didn’t like that at the time, but I convinced myself that “if I truly love her, I should let her at least try, and then she will realize that I’m the one she loves.” That kind of bullshit, you know.

Anyway, I moved out of our rented apartment and moved in with my parents. I was a total mess. I didn’t understand how this could happen so fast: 10 years down the drain, everything blamed on me (which I started to internalize and accept, guilt-tripping myself that I really was that shitty of a boyfriend), and on top of that she already wanted a way to see other guys. It was awful. I quickly wanted to change our agreement so that we would contact each other more often (I figured many of our problems were due to miscommunication, so to solve that we had to talk more, not less) and that we would wait with seeing other people until December, when/if we were truly done. Unfortunately, she was adamant about those rules and didn’t want any change.

During these long 4 months, I joined an online program. It was a combination of a communication course, self‑improvement, and therapy sessions with a certified psychologist. Its purpose was to provide first aid after a heartbreak, improve self‑esteem, and work on how to either win your loved one back or accept the loss and move on. What happened during this time I did not expect. On camera, I saw a girl who was similar to 35A. At first, she was so similar that I literally froze, but then I realized she was someone else… and then this question popped into my mind: “Is this how I meet the mother of my children?”

Not long after that, we created a private group chat for all the heartbroken people in their mid‑20s and 30s from our course. I quickly caught a flow with this girl (27 – let’s call her 27B), and we started to delicately spice up our conversations in chat. She had also gone through a breakup, but she relatively quickly decided that the guy she wanted to win back wasn’t worth her time, so instead she focused more on providing emotional support for other group members. And she was really good at it; she was like a balm on my heart. After two months of a whole lot of group conversations, therapy sessions, and other stuff, I was really fed up with how 35A treated me during this whole separation and also during the time we were together (my family wasn’t a fan of her). I started to seriously consider whether I should just leave my current “relationship” because the damage 35A did felt beyond repair. On the other hand, chatting with 27B felt like… I just had this warm, cozy feeling. Sometimes she mentioned how her previous boyfriends treated her, and I was like, “No way, I never acted that way and I’m sure I never will.” I felt like I could show her that not every guy is bad and that she deserves the best, because I could see how nice she was to others and how empathetic she could be. Plus, she paid money to be there, so I knew she could invest in a relationship and not just give up easily. Occasionally, I noticed that we had a different sense of humor, different taste in music, and different political opinions, but we also shared a lot of similarities: character traits, approach to finances, enthusiasm for the gym, how our days look now and could look in the future… I thought that our core, most important principles were aligned and that we could figure out the rest.

Long story short, after 4 months of 35A’s nonsense, I asked 27B out on a date to finally meet in person. She agreed without hesitation. It turned out that on the same day, 35A wanted to meet and talk about our situation. I agreed, but inside I was pissed it took her that long. I had a strong feeling that she would tell me she wanted to get back together and say some excuses. And I wasn’t wrong. This time, she blamed her outburst and decisions on her therapist (after an incident on previous Christmas, I strongly suggested she go to therapy to work on some behavior that was especially hurtful to my mother), which allegedly left her confused and disoriented, she felt like she was in a prison (I don’t think I ever denied or forbade her to do something) where she needed to conform. She agreed that it was delusional, that she was sorry, and that she was ready to work this out. But I wasn’t. I felt that it was unfair that after 4 months of barely talking, emotionally crippling me, and then blaming it on therapy, I would now just accept her apology. Especially knowing she had been adamant about seeing other guys during that period. Especially when this sweet and empathetic girl wanted to see me on the same day. I told 35A that I didn’t know how I felt about this, that I needed to process everything, and that I would give her my answer by the end of the year. Meanwhile, we could resume our contact. 

The date with 27B went great. Seeing someone on camera can be deceiving, but when she arrived, she looked… gorgeous. I was a bit nervous; I hadn’t been on a real date for over 10 years. But we were laughing, trying to get to know each other, gossiping a bit about people from the group, etc. I was a bit hesitant to show more physical affection because partially I didn’t want to be perceived as a creep and partially I still kind gad a gf. After date, I still wasn’t sure if she liked me “like that,” but on my way back home, during a conversation, it turned out she did.

In our group chat and privately, we were talking nonstop, to the point that other group members called us “husband and wife,” which was super cute at the time but on the long run put pressume on me. I planned our next date, a more active one, and everything went great. It was mid‑December and the end of the year was approaching, which meant two things:
New Year’s Eve party
Deadline for 35A

I felt like I wanted to do something special for 27B. She loves mountains, and I had been invited to a party in a great location in a mountain area with beautiful views. I invited her and told her that I would pick her up with my car and we would drive together to our destination (a 900 km trip for me; she lived in the opposite direction). She accepted, on the condition that I resolve the situation with 35A – she was fully aware of what was going on. I agreed.

I wanted to do it quickly, not wait until the last moment. Christmas was coming, and I wanted 35A to find comfort in her family during that time. But I was hesitant. It had been 10 years. Most of the time, I felt great and alive. She brought a lot of joy into my life. She was vivid and somewhat extroverted in a way that was comfortable for my introverted self. Our sense of humor was perfectly aligned, our taste in music was similar, I felt so good with her for so long, and I thought she felt the same. There were just some situations where we couldn’t find common ground because of miscommunication and differences in temper/defense mechanisms. Nonetheless, I knew I had to do this. I wanted to show 27B that there are good guys out there, that I could be that guy, and that she deserves the best. I couldn’t just say that I had to ditch her.
I visited 35A and told her that I wouldn’t be coming back. I felt like my heart was being torn again, but this time I was the one tearing it. I told her everything that, from my perspective, she did wrong and that she must know by now how much she messed up and how much of what she had previously said was pure delusion. I also told her that I was seeing someone. Then she said that during our 4 months of separation, she went for a coffee with one guy but quickly realized it felt wrong, and she just wanted to feel free (see: the “prison” argument) and raise her self‑esteem rather than do anything even remotely romantic. I had serious doubts, especially since she confessed it only after my confession, but at that point it didn’t matter that much. The last thing I said was: “I’m leaving, but the ball is on your side of the court,” which was stupid as fuck, because I shouldn’t have left room for lingering emotions.

At the NYE party, I felt… bad. I tried to be my usual happy self. I saw that 27B liked everything and that she was happy to be there. We slept together, but I didn’t initiate anything sexual; I just wanted us to get comfortable with our bodies and our warmth, maybe a little teasing here and there but thats it. At the same time, I felt like I was doing something wrong. That I was with the wrong person. That I am a bad person – how could I just leave a woman that I loved for 10 years in such a short time span, when she finally understood, agreed with me, and wanted to work on our problems? Did I just give up on someone I truly loved? And if so, wasn’t I just going to hurt another girl? Can I love her? Do I deserve to be with her? It didn’t help that after seeing 27B with fewer clothes, I started noticing things that were a turn‑off for me. Nothing major, just personal preferences, but it added to my already broken mind and I started to see her as less physically attractive that she really were and compare her with 35A, which is obviously a bad sign. 

After the party, I told 27B gently that I felt a bit off and needed time to adjust. I wanted to be absolutely honest with her. I saw that she took a little distance after that, but we still talked a lot and tried to move forward. Except I didn’t know where to go. On one hand, I wanted to be the best boyfriend she ever had and make her happy. I loved her accent, her understanding of my goals, her empathy, the support she gave me, how tough she was in some situations (life wasn’t easy for her), the fact that she could fight for a good cause and not give up easily. It’s like… what a wonderful wife she could be. All she needed was someone who could appreciate her and took some of her burden. On the other hand, I started to doubt myself. I felt horrible for leaving 35A. She just didn’t know any better at that time. She is from a broken family, raised by her grandma, who did her best but it’s not the same as having two parents. I didn’t want her to end up with a guy who would just use and hurt her. I was worried that I hurt her too, and if so, am I a good, love‑deserving person?

I was stuck. 35A was sending me memes from time to time (part of our love language, but if she wanted to win me back, I needed more than that), and I talked daily with 27B. I saw that 27B was growing impatient (rightfully so) and asked if we were going to meet again. I thought about it and said that I had organized something three times and that it would be nice if she took some initiative. She said that at this moment she wouldn’t do that. After we are officially together, we can plan things together, but at this moment it was up to me. We argued about that for a while, and then she finally said, “But what if I show initiative and we don’t work out?” That caught me off guard, because I was literally taking the same risk, but I am a man, so it’s my “job” (she was more of a trad‑wife type, but at least she also cooked, cleaned, wanted kids, and other things, so I have to say she was consistent). At that point, it hit me hard, because I also wanted to be chosen by her (of course I was, but she showed that by just accepting my plans/proposals), and I wanted her to want me in the same way I was showing it to her. A bit disappointed, I organized two more dates; I think it was March 2025. They were fine, but the guilt and remorse from leaving 35A were piling up, my overall sadness was growing, my self‑doubt was crippling me, and I thought I couldn’t be the man 27B wanted and needed. That I was only going to hold her back. Maybe if 27B had gone beyond her comfort zone and asked me out, but I doubted that and it didn’t happen. I still couldn’t mentally let go of 35A. In April, 27B sprained her ankle, but I broke harder and called 35A, suggesting online therapy for couples. I told 35A that I expected more effort from her than just sending memes, and she said she wanted to give me the time that I needed, but I was angry that again I was the one trying to give a helping hand. At the same time, 27B didn’t want me to meet her parents until we were official (she lived with them), so I thought we wouldn’t see each other for about a month, but honestly that was just a justification in my mind to try to work out what to do with 35A under professional supervision. If I had really wanted to go somewhere with 27B, I would have figured something out. And that’s probably what she expected, because about two weeks after that we started to grow distant. Fewer messages, fewer emojis… I felt what was going on; she was running out of patience. In the meantime, in couples therapy, I was vomiting everything I had in my heart. We had a great counselor; it was really working, except that… it was taking a long time overall. I was still trying to make up my mind, but 27B was done. She said she was giving up – not in straight words, so I didn’t get it at first, but after a couple more days I understood. She barely replied to our daily routine, and then she stopped responding completely. I left her one last note, wishing her all the best and saying that I was sorry I didn’t manage to be the guy who could give her happiness. I think she never received it, it turns out she uninstalled the app because of some issue (seems like an excuse). Anyway, I felt horrible that I disappointed her. I just wished for her to find someone wonderful, not like me, who at the end of the day gave her only false hope. Meanwhile, therapy was intense but moving in a promising direction.

Fast forward to today. 27B found a guy, I think 3 months ago, maybe a little more. In June, I sent her birthday wishes on Instagram; she replied but didn’t continue the conversation. We haven’t spoken since. With 35A, we are still in therapy; we got back together and have basically worked through all our issues. Happy ending for everyone, right?

Day by day, I’m starting to hate myself more and more. Now I know what went wrong with 27B – I was grieving. I didn’t know that. I thought that with the presence of 27B I would kind of skip that part, and I also felt like I had already grieved during our 4‑month separation. But no. Only when I tried to reject 35A from my heart did the true grief over what was lost start. I should have known. To some extent, I was aware that we were starting too soon with 27B, because I told her once that I couldn’t promise her anything because of my state, and that if it was all too fast for her, then I would understand. It turned out she really was ready for something new (maybe because with the last guy it was only 2 years?), and I was the one who should have stayed away from dating at that time.

I wanted to talk about 27B with 35A – what I felt, how it all happened – but she decided she doesn’t want to know anything about her. I respect her boundaries, but at the same time I’m being hit with stronger and stronger waves of emotions. Guilt that I wasn’t present for 27B as much as I should have been. Hatred for myself because in this silent storm of grief I hurt a person who showed me nothing but kindness. Resentment toward 35A because, despite the real progress we have made, after what she did she was not the one who deserved that chance. Crushing sadness.

I don’t know what’s going on anymore. I feel like for 1.5 years I haven’t been able to find peace of mind for longer than a week. I’m torn, split. Every time the thought of leaving 35A crosses my mind, the feeling of loss is just unbearable. Every time I think about 27B, I feel incredible sadness about what we could have been if I had been ready, or if I had just waited and grieved like a decent human being and then ask her out. I really wanted to give her a fair chance, and if our differences turned out to be too big in the long run, then so be it. But now I will probably never know. I miss her so much, but I don’t want to text her now that she has started a new relationship and mess with her head again. I respect that, and it doesn’t bother me because she has every right to search for happiness. There is also a high chance she has already forgotten me, because her decision process was pretty 0/1 and she was patient with me for a long time. She might also just hate me. I hoped she would just stay in my life somehow. For some time, I thought that maybe she would reconsider and reach out to me, but it was unlikely; in her world, a man is the initiator.

Maybe I’m grieving 27B now, but that seems long overdue. I’m just so tired of this rollercoaster. My emotions seem to betray me. I wanted love to be the one thing where I don’t do cold calculations (something amplified by 35A calling me cold) and just follow my heart, but every choice I make seems to lead to a worse and worse result. I’m punishing myself and looking for salvation at the same time, but I don’t know what to do anymore.

27B didnt play second chances, but if I were to fight for her heart I'd know what to do. She opened up to me and, lets say 'gave instructions on a golden platter', but what if I'd destroy her chance with this new guy and then after a while of honest dating we would figure out we are not compatible? 
I think I'm losing it and I see no way out. In a way I feel like I still didnt choose and want them both. 
Any honest perpective would be appreciated, maybe someone somehow had similar experience. I feel terrible.

I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text. In the interest of both your time and my own, **I kindly ask that you read the post carefully in case you see anything that could a dealbreaker for either of us.** With that out of the way...

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* **Childfree** (this means you neither have NOR want children. This is non-negotiable.)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.)
* close enough to whereabouts I'm at so we can see each other regularly
* NOT a cigarette smoker!

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

1r1c4na,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r1c4na,Traceability not very clear: I've bought those beans as natural but It seems washed. What do you suggest me to describe on package label?,"Hello roasters community! My first time here, so introducing myself, I'm a coffee roaster running a three years-old small business in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. As some of you may know, my town is the capital of Minas Gerais State, biggest producer in Brazil, that is the biggest producer in the world. It means there are many origins around where a live, and I'm very privileged to have a lots of possibilities to buy green beans.

That said, I'm here for an advice for older, or the opinion of anyone else. Recently I've bought a 30kg bag from one producer that It was the first time I negotiated with, I had taste his coffee before on an event proving hundred of other coffee togheter and of course couldn't remember it very well. Before I bought his coffee, he sent me a brief description that the coffee was naturally fermented during a long dry, with a thick layer of beans on an raised drying bed, and should have ""classic"" notes like chocolate, caramel, nuts, sugar cane sugar...

For my surprise when the coffee arrived nothing seems to me a coffee that was processed naturally and most notable, with no sign of fermentation, neither the smell, nor the taste. For me the coffee looks and tastes like a washed bean, with more complex notes as honey, floral, corn cake, with citrius acidity and very sweet, that reminds me Sicilian lemon or peach.

Other fact is that this roaster won the third place of a concourse at his region with a coffee that tastes just like some friends and I evaluated this coffee, so I'm wondering he sent me the wrong coffee, but I'm not sure. I asked him about it and he was very reactive, seems like he thought I was complaining about the coffee, but no! The coffee he sent me seems better than the one I taste before and bought from him.

Sorry for long text, and to finish I would like to ask you: have you ever seen a natural coffee that looks like this? It has the golden shaft in the between the beans as a washed should have for me.

What do you think I should put on the package label?",2,1770755234.0,roasting,0,1.0,False
1r1c3ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalist/comments/1r1c3ih/minimalists_what_convenience_do_you_do_fine/,"Minimalists - what ""convenience"" do you do fine without, and which do you think ""hobby minimalists"" are deluding themselves into thinking are necessary?","This came up elsewhere and I thought it might be interesting to see what Reddit thinks. Going to copy/paste here. 

""I know most of us see ""minimalism"" slipping away to mean...whatever a hobby minimalist says that it does. ""30 pairs of shoes, but I live in four seasons and I'm a minimalist"" or ""I have a whole room for my crafts and books but I'm a minimalist because I regularly declutter"". The minimalists of old are now called ""extreme minimalists"" or labeled performative or mentally ill. It would seem that the internet/podcasting/TEDtalk gurus have marketed ""minimalism"" to mean better/more aesthetic organizing ""hacks"", constant decluttering, and ""keep all the things that you love"" or ""having all the things you need AND use (no matter how infrequently)"". Minimalism used to mean that you owned just what was truly necessary and some things that were considered ""necessary conveniences"" by the masses were often looked at as unnecessary and just one more thing to maintain, clean, repair, etc - so not really convenient at all.""

Top ""conveniences"" that minimalists listed in the other discussion: 

Coffee bars/coffee setups/coffee makers - grabbing a coffee from a coffee shop, where all the coffee and equipment live and are cleaned by someone else is much more likely in a minimalist lifestyle. Coffee also seems to be more about a simple morning routine or a needed caffeinating and not part of a personality/identity.

Physical books and magazines/DVDs/CDs/multiple streaming platforms - most seemed to subscribe to one streaming platform of choice if they even do or keep a very small curated selection of movies or albums. Many said they owned no TV or said they used their multifunctional device of choice or a projector and screen if they were avoiding unnecessary screen time (very popular with parents). Others revealed they have just an ereader or tablet for reading, with up to half a dozen different library cards that allow for borrowing digital titles and films. Most folks agreed that the library was a major part of their routines, which brings us to:

Printers/scanners/fax machines/computers/GPS devices/cameras/etc. - seems like a lot of people's libraries are doing the heavy lifting here, too. Instead of owning a GPS device, one user who also doesn't use any navigation app on their phone said they borrow a TomTom from their local library before any road trips. Others said they hardly ever needed to print, scan, or fax anything but if they did, they just went to the library and bundled the trip with the need to check out a free class or pick up a hold or whatever. 

Furniture/decor - consensus seemed to be that this served mostly as a creative outlet for a lot of people and so wasn't necessary to \*live\* in a space. No matter your aesthetics (crisp, clean, minimalist or colorful, loud, statement piece) or budget, most agreed that having the minimal \*amount\* of furniture fit the lifestyle, and also seemed to be looked down on by ""minimalists"". Someone with just a couple of chairs and a simple bed is often told to ""add personality"" to their home or ""don't be scared to add color, ""minimalism"" doesn't mean you have to go without!"", while the minimalist is confused at what the ""minimalist"" thinks they're missing. 

Side note - there was some further discussion about ""borrowing things"". We often hear people, other ""minimalists"", push back on borrowing. The claim that borrowing anything is placing a burden on others, but the rebuttal is that what counts as ""necessary"" to a minimalist isn't exactly what counts for a ""minimalist"". So the typical ""minimalist"" today might fear that the ""spartan living"" of not owning a lawn mower must mean that they have to rely on a neighbor's goodwill in borrowing one (and turning into a mooch), while a minimalist is less likely to even own a home with a yard or more likely to have a service set up to take care of the lawn for them. The same is often said about items like sewing machines, power tools, and ski equipment. What convenience those items bring in owning them could easily be obtained by not needing a sewing machine in the first place (why would a minimalist be producing \*more\* things with a sewing machine or why would a sewing machine be necessary to tackle small repairs when a kit of essentials could do the job?), taking advantage of tool libraries or renting them from local businesses, or renting at the slopes.

So. Thoughts? Have you encountered the pushback for owning just what's necessary? Do you also hear the argument about becoming a mooch when the reality is that you've never needed to borrow a sewing machine or snow blower in your life? Anyone had to sit through the recently decluttered-and-organized tell you to ""add color"" or caution you against ""going too far""? Have you had someone notice that you don't own a TV, practice floor living, or haven't replaced the broken laptop you tossed out seven years ago and go ""whoa, pretty inconvenient lifestyle!""?",1,1770755169.0,minimalist,0,1.0,False

The cold check fluttered down onto the mirror–like marble floor. 

Like a discarded, withered leaf. 

Beatrice Tucker, my former mother–in–law, glanced at me with a look reserved for trash. 

Her voice was as mean as ever, dripping with undisguised contempt. 

“Three hundred million. That’s all your womb was worth to us.

“Consider it the Tucker family doing right by you.” 

“Take the money and vanish. Don’t ever show your face again. The further, the better.” 

“Gracie has already given birth. There’s no place for you here anymore, so stop being an eyesore.” 

I lowered my eyes, my gaze landing on that thin slip of paper on the ground. 

Three hundred million. 

So my marriage of these past few years–the heart and soul I poured into it -was worth just this price. 

A price tag. One they used to throw me out.

An object about to be disposed of. 

The feelings we shared over those years, those vows of eternal love, had all become a joke. 

In their eyes, a woman without a son was already a sinner.

Now, even the last bit of warmth remaining in that ash had been completely drained away. 

I slowly bent down and picked up the check.

Quiet like a puppet finishing its last task. 

It wasn’t until I dragged the suitcase and opened the heavy main door that Rayford finally looked up.

“Do you want the driver to give you a ride?”

My hands trembled as I took the report, staring at the data I couldn’t understand and the final, undeniable conclusion. 

Seeing how dazed I was, the doctor sighed and added something even more shocking. 

“Also, the ultrasound shows quadruplets.” 

“Your health is fragile, and as an older first–time mother, carrying four fetuses is extremely risky.” 

“**I** strongly advise you to consider reducing the number of babies.”

What they dreamed of having–I had four of them right here.

These were my babies. 

They were the only bond heaven had granted me after the whole world had cast me aside. 

A strength I had never felt before surged from the depths of my heart, dispelling all the despair and dead silence. 

I looked up, my gaze steady on the doctor. 

“I won’t do the reduction.” 

“I’ll keep them all. Every single one. No matter the cost.” 

“I’m going to give birth to all of them.

Chapter 1 

The cold check fluttered down onto the mirror–like marble floor. 

Like a discarded, withered leaf. 

Beatrice Tucker, my former mother–in–law, glanced at me with a look reserved for trash. 

Her voice was as mean as ever, dripping with undisguised contempt. 

“Three hundred million. That’s all your womb was worth to us. 

*“}* 

“Consider it the Tucker family doing right by you.” 

“Take the money and vanish. Don’t ever show your face again. The further, the better.” 

“Gracie has already given birth. There’s no place for you here anymore, so stop being an eyesore.” 

I lowered my eyes, my gaze landing on that thin slip of paper on the ground. 

Three hundred million. 

So my marriage of these past few years–the heart and soul I poured into it -was worth just this price. 

A price tag. One they used to throw me out. 

The crystal chandelier in the living room cast a cold light, shining on the man beside me. 

Rayford, my ex–husband, was bowing his head, focused intently on his 

Chapter 1 

phone. 

His profile looked exceptionally cold under the light.

I could even guess that on the other end of the screen was that secretary, Gracie Miller, holding her newborn son and fishing for praise. 

He never once looked at me. 

Not even at the woman he was divorcing. 

From the moment Beatrice started speaking until now, his gaze hadn’t lingered on me for a second. 

As if I were just air. 

An object about to be disposed of. 

The feelings we shared over those years, those vows of eternal love, had all become a joke. 

In their eyes, a woman without a son was already a sinner. 

My heart had long since turned to dead ash amidst countless days and nights of hope and disappointment. 

Now, even the last bit of warmth remaining in that ash had been completely drained away. 

I slowly bent down and picked up the check. 

My fingertips touched the cold paper, feeling nothing real. 

I straightened up, my gaze calmly falling on the divorce agreement they had prepared long ago. 

The agreement lay on the coffee table next to an expensive fountain pen. 

They had prepared so thoroughly

I didn’t speak, didn’t question, and certainly didn’t cry or make a scene. 

I simply walked over, picked up the pen, and signed my name on the last 

page. 

Clarissa Banks. 

The name was written with unusual steadiness. 

After signing, I put the pen back, folded the three–hundred–million check, and put it in my pocket. 

Then, I turned and walked toward the suitcase by the door, which the housekeeper had already packed. 

Throughout the entire process, I didn’t make a single unnecessary sound. 

Quiet like a puppet finishing its last task. 

It wasn’t until I dragged the suitcase and opened the heavy main door that Rayford finally looked up. 

His voice came from behind me, laced with impatient charity. 

“Do you want the driver to give you a ride?” 

I didn’t look back. 

“No need.” 

My voice was soft, yet unusually clear 

“Mr. Tucker. I wish the three of you a lifetime of happiness.” 

The door clicked shut behind me, cutting off the place I once called “home” 

Outside, it had started raming without me noticing. 

Chapter 1 

Iey rain, driven by the wind, lashed against my face. 

Dragging my suitcase, I walked down the empty street. 

The rain blurred my vision and washed away the last shreds of my ridiculous dignity.

The whole world seemed shrouded in this curtain of rain, so heavy I could barely breathe. 

I was abandoned. 

By my husband, by his family, by the love I thought I could entrust my life to. 

A sharp cramp twisted in my stomach. 

My knees buckled, and I pitched forward uncontrollably. 

Before my consciousness faded into total darkness, I had only one thought. 

Maybe dying would be easier than being thrown away like this. 

I woke up in a blinding whiteness. 

The sharp scent of antiseptic filled my nose. 

A female doctor in a white coat stood by the bed, studying a report in her hand 

Seeing I was awake, she spoke, her expression complex. 

“Ms. Banks, you’re awake.” 

You have low blood sugar, and combined with extreme emotional stress, that’s why you fainted.” 

I braced myself against the edge of the bed to sit up, but a dull throb in

my stomach stopped me.

“Don’t move around. You’re not just taking care of yourself anymore.” 

I froze. 

“What do you mean?” 

The doctor adjusted her glasses and handed me a medical report. 

“You’re pregnant. Eight weeks. And it’s not just one.” 

My mind went blank. 

Pregnant? 

Just when I had given up all hope and was ready to leave for good? 

My hands trembled as I took the report, staring at the data I couldn’t understand and the final, undeniable conclusion. 

Seeing how dazed I was, the doctor sighed and added something even more shocking.

Estou a pensar montar o meu primeiro setup de café e precisava da vossa ajuda.

Estou indeciso entre:

	•	Sage Bambino Plus + DF54

	•	Sage Barista Express Impress

Na vossa opinião, qual faz mais sentido a longo prazo: combo máquina + moinho separado ou tudo-em-um?

Sobre o DF54:

	•	A marca MiiCoffee DF54 que aparece na Amazon é original?

	•	Já li relatos de problemas/falsificações — confirmam?

Em alternativa, aconselham mais algum moinho tipo Baratza Encore ESP ou Eureka para emparelhar com a Bambino?

Por fim qual seria um bom preço para ambas as maquinas?

Segundo o histórico que encontro o mais baixo na Bambino foi 435€ e 600€ na Express Impress

I’m a 54-year-old neurodivergent/polyamorous guy in the east end of Toronto looking to meet new people and build genuine, low-pressure friendships. 

Not here for immediate hookups. I’m just hoping to connect with people who enjoy good conversation, laughs, and spending time together without expectations and the lowkey Netflix or CrunchyRoll marathons 

Age-gap friendly vibe:

I get along well with people of different ages and backgrounds, and I’m totally comfortable making friends younger or older than me. Connection matters more than a number. I feel you conect to the energy of the person not their age, colour,  gender or religion. 

What I’m hoping to find:

Someone to hang out with now and then – coffee runs, random local events, thrift store wandering, walks, food adventures, festivals, board games, or just relaxed conversations about life. Simple, easygoing, human connection. 

About me:

Indigenous & Pagan

Open-minded and poly-friendly

A bit nerdy and creative

Neurodivergent (very okay if you are too)

Into community, curiosity, and good energy

Life kept me busy for a long time and I realized my social circle has gotten pretty small. I’m at a stage where I’d really like to change that and meet people outside the usual routines.

If you’re someone who likes real conversations, chill vibes, and doing random fun stuff without pressure – feel free to reach out.

Being the last one of my family who wasn’t mated, I have seen how different bonds work. Some are better than others. I have seen my siblings have to fight for their mates and even be separated from them because of different circumstances, so I wasn’t particularly fond of the idea. Still, at the age of twenty-four, I should have found them already. I even thought I would share a mate with my other two brothers since we are triplets, but that wasn’t the case. The walls in my room feel like a prison, so I do what every woman with the ability to teleport would do. I went on another trip to clear my mind. I’ve been everywhere, from the sun-bleached ruins of Greece to the mist-shrouded peaks of the Himalayas. I’ve sipped coffee in a bustling Parisian café at dawn and watched the Northern Lights dance over the frozen silence of the Arctic. The problem is, none of those trips satisfies me anymore. I have gone to other realms as well, but I’m tired of watching my siblings get all cozy with their mates while I’m all alone. I love my nieces and nephews, but I want to be on my own. I considered all the endless possibilities and decided to visit Greece once more. I haven’t been to the smaller, forgotten islands in years—the ones where the only sounds are the cicadas and the sea, and the air smells of wild thyme and dry earth—a place untouched by the frantic energy surrounding my pack. I focus on the memory of a tiny, secluded beach on Ikaria, a place I found by accident a decade ago. The wonderful thing about teleportation is that I can be anywhere without side effects. Everyone in my family can do it, but I’m the best in that area. I land on my feet in soft, sun-warmed sand. The Aegean sun, even in the late afternoon, is a welcome weight on my skin. “This was what I needed,” I mumbled as I stared at the sea. “Hello, Miss,” A woman stood from a lounge chair I hadn’t noticed, shaded by a cluster of bamboo and linen. She was older, her skin weathered by the sun into a map of fine lines, but her smile was warm and immediate. She held a book in one hand, a glass of iced tea perspiring in the other. “A beautiful spot, isn’t it? It rarely has visitors.” I started, my heart giving a frantic leap. Geez, I was so out of it. I should have heard her or at least registered her presence. This proves how much I needed a break. “It is,” I replied. “I’m sorry to intrude. I thought the beach was deserted.” “No intrusion at all, my dear. The sea is for everyone,” she said, her accent a melodic blend of Greek and something else I couldn’t place. Her eyes, a startlingly light blue, crinkled at the corners as she looked me over, not with judgment, but with a deep, unnerving curiosity. “You arrived quite… suddenly. I blinked, and there you were.” Damn it. “Y-yeah,” I stammered as I scratched the back of my head. “People have told me I’m quick on my feet.” I forced a laugh that sounded brittle even to my own ears. Her knowing smile didn’t waver, but she mercifully let my pathetic excuse lie. “Are you staying at one of the villas?” she asked, changing the subject. She gestured with her book toward the cliffs where a few whitewashed buildings were nestled among the greenery. “No, I just arrived,” I said, the truth feeling safer now. “I don’t have a place to stay yet.” “Ah!” Her face lit up. “Then you must try the new lodging in the village. It is not grand, not like the resorts on the other side of the island. But it is clean, the family that runs it is lovely, and the view from the terrace… it will steal the breath from your lungs.” She leaned forward conspiratorially. “And the father makes his own ouzo. A dangerous talent.” It sounded perfect. Simple. Real. Exactly the kind of place I wouldn’t normally look for but suddenly craved. “Thank you. I’ll do that.” I said my goodbyes, my mind already shifting from the strange encounter to the practicalities of finding a room. I focused on the image of a village square she’d inadvertently projected—a small church, a handful of tables under a vine-covered pergola—and teleported. The world dissolved and reassembled in the span of a heartbeat. I stood at the edge of the village plaza, the setting sun casting long shadows across the cobblestones. The air was different here—warm stone, grilling meat, the faint, sweet smell of jasmine. And then, it hit me. A scent. Sharp, clean, and utterly intoxicating—like the zest of a fresh lime sliced open under the Mediterranean sun—it was mixed with something wilder that I couldn’t place. The scent bypassed my brain and went straight to my core, a jolt of pure, undiluted awareness. Thethys, my wolf, suddenly shot to her feet and started growling inside my mind. “Everything okay?” I asked because she was usually silent. I’ve seen how much my siblings speak to their wolves, but mine isn’t like that. She is quieter and reserved, the total opposite of who I am. Thethys kept growling, but she never, not once, answered my question. I sighed in defeat. “I sometimes wonder why you are so damn moody,” I mumbled back. “Can’t you scent that?” She suddenly replied, leaving me dumbfounded. I closed my eyes to track the scent, but for some reason, it was everywhere. I couldn’t pinpoint the origin, which should be easy for me, considering I’m a wolf. “Should we use magic?” I suggested, but she shook her head. “We won’t be able to track him. We don’t have anything of his,” She explained. Hmm… so my mate is a he. I have had my fun here and there, with men and women. I’m not the kind of person who enjoys waiting around, so I thought it would be fun to gain some experience once I met my mate. I didn’t want to go into our first night together completely blind. “Then what do you suggest?” Theia stopped growling and started pacing. She had no idea what we should do, and because of my question, she was now on edge. “Fine,” I muttered under my breath, more to myself than to my agitated wolf. “Forget tracking. Let’s just find this lodging.” The pull of the scent was a constant, maddening hum in my veins, a compass needle spinning wildly because the source was everywhere and nowhere at once. It was infuriating. I was the best teleporter in my family, a master of spatial awareness, and I couldn’t pinpoint the one thing that mattered most. I forced my feet to move, walking away from the main square and deeper into the labyrinth of whitewashed streets. The scent of lime and wildness followed me, a ghost I couldn’t shake. With every step, Thethys’ pacing in my mind grew more frantic, a caged animal sensing its keeper just beyond the bars. “He’s close,” She grunted. “So close…” “You’re not helping,” I shot back silently, my own nerves fraying. I tried to focus on the directions the woman on the beach had given me—look for the blue door with the fishing net, then turn left at the old well. But my attention was fractured, split between navigating the unfamiliar village and resisting the primal urge to stop and just… breathe him in. I found it. The lodging was a charming, two-story building with a deep blue door, just as described. A hand-painted sign swung gently in the evening breeze: ‘Thalassa Rooms’. But as I reached for the wrought-iron handle, the lime scent intensified, sharpening from a general ambiance to a specific, devastating point of origin. It was coming from inside. My hand froze an inch from the door. Thethys went utterly still, a hunter zeroing in on its prey. Here. He is here. The door swung open before I could process the thought, before I could flee. A man stood there, filling the doorway. He was tall, with sun-streaked golden hair and eyes the color of the moon. He held a stack of fresh linen in his arms and smelled of clean cotton, soap, and… lime. The wild, intoxicating lime scent was rolling off him in waves, so potent it was a physical force. Our eyes met. Time stopped. I knew he wasn’t human; the aura surrounding him was too strong. He wasn’t a wolf either, but a supernatural, that was for sure. “Can I help you?” he asked, his voice deeper than I expected, laced with a faint Greek accent that made the simple question sound like a caress. “MATE!” Thethys howled as she wagged her tail. Could he recognize me? What should I do or say? He was my mate. And from the way his eyes widened, the way his grip on the linens tightened until his knuckles turned white, he felt it too. The air between us crackled, thick with unspoken recognition and the overwhelming scent of lime and destiny. “I… I was told you might have a room,” I managed to choke out, my voice barely a whisper. It was a miracle I could form words at all. He just stared at me, his sea-moon eyes wide with a shock that mirrored my own. He opened his mouth, perhaps to answer, perhaps to ask the million questions I saw swirling in his gaze. But then a light and melodic voice floated from inside the house. “Leo? Who is it, agapi mou?” Leo? The name sounds wrong. A woman appeared behind him, sliding her arm through his with a familiar ease that made my blood run cold. She was stunning, with dark curls tumoring over her shoulders and a smile that could launch ships. And there, on the side of her neck, just above her collarbone, was a mark. It was not a mate mark, but a love one. And it smelled of him. “I want to kill her,” Thethys growled. I took a deep breath. He may have his past, just like I have mine. I won’t be such a hypocrite to act like this is the end of the world when he might meet some of the people I have had s\*x back at the pack. The man—Leo—flinched, his gaze darting from me to the woman on his arm, a complicated mix of guilt, panic, and confusion flashing across his face. At least it seems he cares. The woman, oblivious to the cataclysm she had just stepped into, beamed at me. “Hello! Are you looking for a room? We have one left, it’s our best one! The view is incredible.” I couldn’t speak, so I only nodded like an i\*\*\*t. The woman’s smile widened. “Perfect! I am Eleni. This is my friend, Leo. Welcome to Thalassa Rooms.” Friend… So they were in a relationship. “May I ask for your name for your reservation?” Her voice was still sweet, like honey. I couldn’t even get mad at her because she was not being a b\*\*\*h. I wonder what will happen once Leo tells her who I am. “My name is Anika Hills.” “Hills? I have heard that last name,” she mumbled under her breath. I smiled. “My family is rich, that’s why you may have heard of me.” Her eyebrows furrowed as she shook her head. “No, I don’t think that is it.” She turned her head to look at Leo. “You asked me about the Hills family, didn’t you?” My eyebrows shot up. Has he known about me? For how long?",1,1770754599.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

He wasn’t a wolf either, but a supernatural, that was for sure. “Can I help you?” he asked, his voice deeper than I expected, laced with a faint Greek accent that made the simple question sound like a caress. “MATE!” Thethys howled as she wagged her tail. Could he recognize me? What should I do or say? He was my mate. And from the way his eyes widened, the way his grip on the linens tightened until his knuckles turned white, he felt it too. The air between us crackled, thick with unspoken recognition and the overwhelming scent of lime and destiny. “I… I was told you might have a room,” I managed to choke out, my voice barely a whisper. It was a miracle I could form words at all. He just stared at me, his sea-moon eyes wide with a shock that mirrored my own. He opened his mouth, perhaps to answer, perhaps to ask the million questions I saw swirling in his gaze. But then a light and melodic voice floated from inside the house. “Leo? Who is it, agapi mou?” Leo? The name sounds wrong. A woman appeared behind him, sliding her arm through his with a familiar ease that made my blood run cold. She was stunning, with dark curls tumoring over her shoulders and a smile that could launch ships. And there, on the side of her neck, just above her collarbone, was a mark. It was not a mate mark, but a love one. And it smelled of him. “I want to kill her,” Thethys growled. I took a deep breath. He may have his past, just like I have mine. I won’t be such a hypocrite to act like this is the end of the world when he might meet some of the people I have had s\*x back at the pack. The man—Leo—flinched, his gaze darting from me to the woman on his arm, a complicated mix of guilt, panic, and confusion flashing across his face. At least it seems he cares. The woman, oblivious to the cataclysm she had just stepped into, beamed at me. “Hello! Are you looking for a room? We have one left, it’s our best one! The view is incredible.” I couldn’t speak, so I only nodded like an i\*\*\*t. The woman’s smile widened. “Perfect! I am Eleni. This is my friend, Leo. Welcome to Thalassa Rooms.” Friend… So they were in a relationship. “May I ask for your name for your reservation?” Her voice was still sweet, like honey. I couldn’t even get mad at her because she was not being a b\*\*\*h. I wonder what will happen once Leo tells her who I am. “My name is Anika Hills.” “Hills? I have heard that last name,” she mumbled under her breath. I smiled. “My family is rich, that’s why you may have heard of me.” Her eyebrows furrowed as she shook her head. “No, I don’t think that is it.” She turned her head to look at Leo. “You asked me about the Hills family, didn’t you?” My eyebrows shot up. Has he known about me? For how long?",1,1770754590.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False
1r1bst4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Husband/comments/1r1bst4/will_my_husband_ever_actually_join_the_marriage/,Will my husband ever actually join the marriage?,"6 years & he’s the single most amazing man ever. His strength, persistent growth as a provider, great dad…. We both come from rough backgrounds & that’s completely considered when dealing with things. But we have had plenty of issues throughout our marriage from many things. All around there are areas we have failed eachother BUT I wouldn’t trade him for a damn thing. Perfectly flawed just for me. The flaws built & helped the man I love so deeply survive things nobody would’ve came out with their sanity intact. I’m proud of him and the man he was, has become and the ma he’s growing into. I’m insanely proud to be his wife. He’s plastered all over my world…. I don’t post selfies of myself as a rule for myself because I never want to invite unwanted attention. I’m so about my husband I do t even like a man in passing ask a “how ya doin” my mind immediately comes up with a snarky response in my mind (that’s my husbands business not you stranger danger) 

I’m not perfect but I consider at least an okay wife. I try to make sure he has a great lunchbox packed daily. I cook most days but we do eat out often as well to just allow me to relax as his helping hand since we do travel with him for work. 

It’s so important to me to do little things like laying his clothes out for work and having his things together and prepared for him to just get up and have a easy morning or as easy as I can make it. I Make coffee & pack his food. 

I take a LOT of pride in the fact that I do things to serve him like I try to take his boots off daily when he comes in & if I miss it and don’t it literally breaks my heart a little. My feelings genuinely get hurt if I’m not the one to get his boots off. I loooove cleaning his feet up and giving him a pedicure so much no matter how work funky they are. 

I genuinely have given my marriage my absolute all. 

And at this point I just don’t understand what more I can do. 

He says he feels like I want more than him sexually… ( when from my standpoint I’ve never been so euphorically satisfied in my life as I come from long term sexual abuse & he’s the first I’ve ever enjoyed intimacy in the bedroom. Like I’m absolutely infatuated with this man in every way & I do not get how he doesn’t see it?) what am I missing?! This department has always been great with him but we had some things happen and ended up exploring sexually an really opened up to eachother & this is a very vulnerable touchy area for me and it’s extremely odd to be so comfortable and it all be so pleasurable it scares me to death the power he has I. This department and him being the only to ever have that part of me comfortably. I have no clue how he could think anything less. 

He swears I’ve cheated on him and puts a fair amount of effort into trying to catch me cheating with no prevail because it’s EXTREMELY important to me to never cause him that kind of pain at all. Like if I have a second by myself for any reason whatsoever innocently just taking a mental break or if I took longer than I should’ve to go run an errand these things give him major doubts but it’s to a point we have a lot of kids and I never get a second to myself and it’s really exhausting I’m serving everyone around me 25/8 and barely get time to do anything not in mom mode. When I’m not serving them and homeschooling or cooking or cleaning I’m serving him and trying to make sure his needs are met and he’s getting the love and care he deserves. 

I’m human I fall short…. But I don’t cheat. Not within my marriage. I put those childish things away PERIOD. 

  With this being said I’ve caught him being very chatty on the internet and this has to do with some other factors as well that are more personal but I found it and have tried to meet the needs or fulfill areas I wasn’t. 

I know he loves me. 

I just don’t know or understand the parts where we can literally not get through anything because it’s the same thing time and time again. Although he’s the one that has stepped out in a big way in my opinion I do see a trying man. But not the man I see him be to others. I notice things like the fact that EVERYTHING I do or any account I have it’s EXTREMELY clear to start with that I’m a very proud wife. He’s the forefront of most everything in my life. 

But if you look at most of his accounts I’m nowhere. He’s plastered in my entire world even when his actions and choices to not choose me and stand and work through the unhealed trench I was in he went elsewhere, not physically. All the while I didn’t get it? He just was in the road and too tired to talk much or cranky with me so I have experienced the loneliness heavily. But we don’t talk much about that. Well I do but he never listens to understand my pain and make it important to fix it. But if he’s uncomfortable or has the slightest suspicion it’s addressed. I’ve been flat out told if I don’t work on me and healing he will leave me. But if I say the same he acts like it’s more like “ooof tough loss there” as to where I’m like obsessed with learning how to be a good wife since I haven’t had much of an example on what that looks like and he hasn’t either. Both from broken homes. So I do consider all of this….. 

but when something is a priority or is within his interest he will absolutely learn it all to a tee and perfect whatever is in front of him with the quickness….. 

HE WOLL NOT DO THIS AS A HUSBAND. 

He’s aggravated that I ask insecure questions and get worried and go through his phone. He says he wants transparency as in spyware we can mutually see everything in the others phone. But he won’t allow me to log into his accounts. He can pick my phone up at any whim of him Being uncomfortable no problem. He gets pushback because I’m hurt and lost and unsure yet still serving and standing in my commitment, loyalty and integrity. That’s so much growth for me. Totally different woman than I was 6 years ago. 

I have physically went I. His phone and logged into my accounts on his phone because I don’t want him to have doubts or fears. He will absolutely not stay in them and he won’t allow me in his unless he’s ready. If I pop up and say hey lemme see this when it’s spur of the moment it’s uncomfortable & annoyed that he has to deal with that. I’m at a huge loss. I have no clue how to deal with this because I’ll never comply easily to a divorce. It makes me sick. I don’t want a new life without him. I just don’t know what to Mae of things sometimes. We will be all in love them BOOM I’m the enemy. When in all actuality I’m the most solid individual that he’s ever had. We really are all we got. But I feel so disposable. He wouldn’t run over me or show much of a weakness if I walked away. I’m not sure he would even miss a beat without me all while he gives me life. It’s like I’ve been the only one participating in the marriage most of the time. I’ve tried to get him to play games with me and all kinds of things and he absolutely won’t. He will ignore all the in your face signs that I’m insanely obsessed with him so he can say I’m not. 

It’s literally like he is completely blind to the flaming signs that I’m a solid loyal wife and finds something to try to discredit me and not acknowledge it. 

I’ve forgiven him for his handling of things and his deviation from the marriage in some ways but there are things that hurt a bit different and it’s not important to him to make me comfortable and to give me peace of mind but he requires it. 

I want to hear from men or husbands that can give me CONSTRUCTIVE feedback or some insight because I just want to understand better. Our communication sucks a lot lately and it’s just been super tough to get through something’s but at the end of the day he’s my person and I believe in his but between him being a man and coming from the background he does at times he’s at as much of a loss as I am. Maybe the communication skill to articulate is slack? It’s like we are speaking 2 different languages. So I’m asking for any help.

I DONT WANT TO HEAR NEGATIVITY AS IN HES CONTROLLING OR ABUSIVE. This is a very short likely messy piece of us. This isn’t everything but it’s a piece of the bulk. It’s the area I need help understanding. ",1,1770754521.0,Husband,0,1.0,False

[UPDATED Top 5 List],"I’ve been deep in research on portable power stations recently and put together an updated Top 5 list for 2026 based on actual customer feedback, real use cases, recharge speed, and best pricing available.

I wanted to share the breakdown in case you’re shopping for one for camping, emergency backup, or home gear.

* Here's the full review article on our blog: [https://portablepowerstationreviews.com/best-portable-power-stations-in-2026-our-top-5-list/](https://portablepowerstationreviews.com/best-portable-power-stations-in-2026-our-top-5-list/) 
* Here's the video version of the article: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAYCXTS04l8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAYCXTS04l8)
* (special coupons available in the article and video)

Here’s the quick summary (ranked #5 → #1):

# #5 - Anker SOLIX C2000 Gen 2

* Great **energy capacity of 2048Wh** and **\~58 min full recharge**.
* Solid **4.7★ Amazon reviews** \- people say it keeps fridges running and is reliable for home backup or camping. Some reviewers specifically mention it can run a CPAP machine, and many like the compact size.
* Cons: the weight is a bit heavy (around 40 lbs), but most think it’s worth it for the power.

# #4 - EcoFlow Delta 2

* **1024Wh capacity** and **fully recharges in \~80 min.**
* Also **4.7★ on Amazon** \- customers praise fast charging, easy setup, and strong performance powering phones, laptops, and major household appliances (one even mentioned using it with Starlink internet).
* Cons: Smaller capacity and slower recharge compared to the Anker SOLIX C2000, but the lower price point accommodates that.

# #3 - Jackery Explorer 1000 v2

* Good for medium appliances: laptops, drones, power tools.
* **1070Wh capacity**, and **1.7 hr full recharge**. (different recharge speed settings available on the Jackery App, as quick as 1 hour)
* **4.7★ Amazon reviews** \- people call it amazing for power outages, one mentions 12+ hours running a fridge (check your own specifications), and praise the fast recharge and value.
* Cons: Doesn't have expandable capacity like the Anker SOLIX C2000 Gen 2 and EcoFlow Delta 2 do.

# #2 - Anker SOLIX C1000 Gen 2

* **1,024Wh capacity** and ultra-fast **49 min recharge**.
* **4.6★ Amazon rating** \- customers say it’s high-quality and runs a fridge well, lasting up to 3 nights on a charge and handling projectors for long sessions. People like the easy setup and relatively light weight (about 25 lbs).

# #1 - Jackery Explorer 300

* Best pick for small appliances & outdoors, portable and versatile (only 7 lbs)
* **Energy capacity of 293Wh**, 0-80% recharge time of 2 hours (**\~4 hr total recharge**).
* **4.6★ Amazon reviews** \- users say it powers LED lights, a Keurig coffee pot, and love how portable it is for camping and boats. Charging from a 12 V car battery also gets called out.
* Cons: lower energy capacity, so it's limited to small uses. But it's super low price point and light weight of makes it a great entry level portable power station.

# Quick takeaways

* Anker SOLIX and EcoFlow models dominate if you need heavy output and fast recharging.
* Jackery Explorer 300 is best value for lightweight use.
* Customer feedback seems very consistent across sites, but reliability and real-world use matter more than just specs.

If anyone’s tested these in cold weather or real off-grid setups, would love to hear what you thought!

* Are there any newer models you’ve seen this year worth adding?
* Odd quirks you ran into when using these in real life?",1,1770754448.0,PowerStationReviews,0,1.0,False
1r1bqks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1r1bqks/help_me_replicate_this/,Help me replicate this...,"I have been using a Keurig for years but something in me wanted to pull out my 20 year old aeropress from the back shelf.

What I want to do with the aeropress is replicate the morning cup of coffee that I get from a Keurig (K Supreme Plus). On that machine I am using pre-gound Lavazza Perfetto in the Kcup adapter that holds ground coffee. I measured it out and it holds 17g.   
The settings on the Keurig is max strength (2 minute brew time) and max temp (180F).   
I make a 12oz cup and then add another 4oz of water. For ME it is an enjoyable cup of coffee. Also add a splash (\~ a teaspoon) of cream.

I've tried over the last week to replicate it in the aeropress but it's just not coming out the same. I know there are a lot of people on here with a lot of AP experience and want to get advice on how to replicate this type of cup.

I've tried (all inverted) \~20g (one heaping AP scoop) of the Lavazza.   
Add 175F water to near the top of the AP.  
Stir 10 second.  
Cap (paper filter) and remove air.  
Steep for 1-1.5 minutes.  
Press slow (40-50 seconds)  
Add water to make the total volume 16oz.  
Far too weak. 

Tried same as above but with boiling water then let cool for about 30 seconds.  
Let steep for 3 minutes.  
Stronger but bitter and didn't taste very smooth.

Anyone think they can help me try to replicate the Keurig?",1,1770754394.0,AeroPress,1,1.0,False

The problem has been getting the right personality matches  —- it’s really hard to tease out the personalities of women from Hinge profiles.

Usually I notice most profiles devote 50-75% of the words to describe what they want or don’t want, which usually doesn’t tell me a lot about them. The last bit is usually “I like clean sheets, coffee and Farmers markets on Sundays”.

INGREDIENTS:

* 75 g water (or ½ cup water)\* ($0.00)
* 75 g all-purpose flour (or ½ cup flour) ($0.07)

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Directions for Day 1
2. Clean
3. Sanitize a large mason jar and zero it out (or “tare”) on a kitchen scale set to measure grams.\*\*
4. Add 75g of all purpose flour to the jar. For me, this was ½ cup of flour.
5. Pour
6. Zero out the scale again by pressing the “tare” button, and add 75g of water. If you don’t have a kitchen scale, just use a 1:1 ratio of water to flour throughout the entire process. So, if you add ½ cup of flour, add ½ cup of water.
7. Mix
8. Stir the flour and water together with a clean spoon and cover the jar with a piece of cheesecloth, a coffee filter, or a clean, dry paper towel.\*\*\* Secure the cloth with an elastic or butcher twine. You want to make sure you give it a good stir—oxygen is necessary when making sourdough starter!
9. Rest
10. Let it sit on the counter for 24 hours in a 75-80 degree warm spot. I like to make a little line on the glass jar with a permanent marker so I can see how much my starter grows as it develops over the course of the week.
11. Directions for Day 2
12. Stir
13. Give your starter a stir with a clean spoon. Remember, oxygen is good for the process! Let it sit for Day 2 undisturbed in the 75-80 degree warm spot while it develops a bit more. You may see bubbles on day 2, or you may not. Trust the process!
14. Directions for Day 3 to (potentially) Day 14
15. Remove
16. It’s feeding time! Remove half of the sourdough starter from the jar. This is your discard! Use a spoon and scoop it out…eyeball what’s “half”, or use your scale. Remember to factor in the weight of the empty jar if you’re using a scale to get the exact number.
17. Mix
18. To the jar, add 75g of all-purpose flour and 75g of water. Mix with a clean spoon until completely smooth. It will look like thick pancake or muffin batter.
19. Cover with a coffee filter, paper towel, or cheese cloth with an elastic band and let it sit on the countertop for 12-24 hours.
20. Repeat these steps over and over until it has doubled in size (at least 250-300g), has consistent bubbles, smells pleasantly yeasty, and appears to be the texture of marshmallow fluff!
21. Name your starter! It’s the “mother” of every loaf of bread you’ll make from here on out…Plus, it’s bad luck if you don’t! (Mine are named Agnes and Rita after my grandmothers!)",1,1770754326.0,RecipesAndMealPlan,0,1.0,False

1r1bp81,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1r1bp81/passed_out_doing_prep_and_broke_my_nose/,Passed out doing prep and broke my nose,"Just gonna start out with: I’m a mess, my mind’s always a mess. I (F/26) had a lot of anxiety about this to begin with—not the upper endoscopy/colonoscopy part, but the prep specifically. I have a lot of issues with ongoing chronic illness, explained more at the bottom.

—

I didn’t sleep hardly at all last night, maybe 2 hrs all together, every time I had to get up to use the bathroom my vision started getting spottier and spottier until I eventually was “flying completely blind” and smacked into the air purifier and wall, and then when I got up from toilet to go back to my room, I passed completely out on the kitchen floor & landed right on my nose.

Blood all over the kitchen floor. Luckily I had my apple watch on so I fumbled to call for mom and luckily got ahold of her (at 5:00am), where I tried to explain that I passed out and hit my nose really hard; I was crying and feeling so out of it and feeling so terrible. I had to get back up to go back to the toilet, and yeah, it‘s embarrassing to be shitting myself as I’m on the phone with her but it was that or shit my pants. Literally could not sit upright on the toilet (I was leaning over the side of the bathtub as I was on the toilet) and was bleeding all over the arms of my shirt from my nose. 

She got over here about an hour after that phone call after making sure I didn’t want to call an ambulence (I have a phobia of ER and healthcare in general after dealing with a lot of medical gaslighting with this ongoing chronic illness, and I just remember saying repeatedly “they won’t believe me“. I was not in the right mind state at all, made all the more anxious by the lack of sleep and how awful I felt). When she got here she made sure I was “stable”, as in, not going to immediately pass out again, then helped me to call the colonoscopy clinic to ask them about the situation, which they made me cancel the appointment since I passed out, because that’s a negative for anasthesia. She then helped me get somewhat ready before taking me over to Urgent Care. Well, they said I had to go to the ER, which was right next door. 

Everyone was actually really nice to me, and I don’t recall even seeing a male doctor or nurse, which was also good. 

Moral of the story: I passed out so hard that I broke my nose, confirmed via cat scan. 

and it’s like???? nobody told me that that could even be a possibility with colonoscopy prep; the gist is that yeah, it sucks, and you don’t feel great, but normally people don’t ever pass out. and this was with me having drunk a shit ton of fluids—much more than the 64oz miralax mixture. I had 3 cups of chicken broth, 2 sugar-free jellos, an early-morning coffee, and at least another 32oz water.

what i’m suspecting is that it was a steep drop in potassium, mixed with whatever this chronic illness is that makes me much more susceptible to weakness with not eating. i didn’t have any appetite all day yesterday, but i usually eat every 2-3hrs during waking hours, and if i dont, the weakness creeps in hella fast. 

the ER ended up just calling it dehydration because they were like ??? apparently I was a first, to pass out and break my nose doing colonoscopy prep. my potassium blood level came back at 3.6, but i have a suspicion that my blood levels never reflect the amount truly in my muscles, especially since they usually take my potassium with a tourniquet and/or try making my ball my fist, which can falsely elevate the blood serum levels.

——

Some more info:

I have an (still) undiagnosed, worsening chronic illness, and the new GI I got referred immediately wanted to do an upper endoscopy+colonoscopy. His main concerns from a GI standpoint are my continued weight loss (\~200lbs June 2024, to around 130lbs as of now, Feb 2026), still have no appetite, near constant stomach pain even after eliminating about 95% of my previous diet (I can’t eat apples, onions, celery, any nuts including peanuts anymore, just to name a few, without severe stomach pain \[upper left quadrant\] but I never got diagnosed with IBS because my bowels have been normal, 1x every day at the same time every day in the morning).

I have a history of hypokalemia/low blood potassium, and am on 20mEq potassium every day. I also have a history of fluctuating weakness, to where I cannot even walk (was admitted to ER back in July 2025 for 2 days for observation because I had fallen and was a continued fall risk; ended up getting prescribed a walker for at-home use, but they found nothing diagnostically other than mild anemia). Basically all my specialists are left scratching their heads and call me a mystery. Some random ongoing symptoms: severe pain in the right side back of my neck+upper right arm that is now somewhat managed by taking 500mg L-carnitine, a bunch of cardiac-like symptoms like unmanaged angina, short of breath with exertion+lying flat on back, cough with exertion, was recently diagnosed with venous reflux disorder in my left leg but both legs hurt terribly especially all night long when I’m trying to sleep. Vision has gotten terrible and I’ve had to use steroid eyedrops since June 2025. I could go on and on; it’s a lot. One specialist suggested something like mitochondrial disease, another suggested Myasthenia Gravis, but no formal testing for either.

In 2023, I was working out every day, lifting weights, all my hobbies were outdoors such as hiking and rock hunting. Now, I’m having to lie down in bed from about noon every day, can no longer drive, and can’t even go anywhere other than to my drs appointments). I’m tired of dealing with a body like this. I don’t even know how I’m to do the colonoscopy part of this. I might have to just get the upper endoscopy done separately.",1,1770754312.0,colonoscopy,2,1.0,False

1r1bhoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelFanStory/comments/1r1bhoy/iron_symbol/,Iron Symbol,"Rain rolled across the glass rooftops of **Dublin, Ireland**, turning the city lights into rivers of gold and neon. Inside a converted warehouse near the River Liffey, sparks flashed like tiny lightning storms.

At the center of the workshop stood **Siobhán Kelleher**, 24 years old, electrical engineer, robotics prodigy, and insomniac by choice. Her red curls were tied back with a soldering wire. Grease streaked her cheek. Before her stood a half-assembled armored frame emerging from a bank of industrial 3-D printers, each humming in layered harmony.

“Layer 9,432 complete,” her workstation announced.

Siobhán grinned.  
“Good. Don’t get smug. We’re just getting started.”

She wasn’t building a costume.

She was building a **system** — a fully modular combat-rescue exosuit designed to be printed, repaired, and upgraded in the field. No billionaire funding. No defense contract. Just code, recycled alloys, and stubborn genius.

Her best friend and former university classmate, **Eamon Doyle**, appeared on the workshop screen via video call.

“You’re still at it?” Eamon asked. “It’s 3:12 in the morning.”

“History doesn’t clock out,” Siobhán replied. “Watch this.”

She triggered a test cycle. The printed gauntlet lifted itself using embedded micro-servos and stabilized with self-balancing gyros.

Eamon blinked.  
“That’s… that’s cleaner than the Stark open patents.”

“I improved the energy routing,” she said. “Less loss, more output.”

“You just casually improved Stark tech. Sure. Normal Tuesday.”

She laughed. But neither of them realized the livestream of her published prototype tests — meant for academic peer review — had already been noticed elsewhere.

# The Message from America

Two weeks later, Siobhán nearly dropped her coffee when the email header loaded.

**STARK INDUSTRIES — DIRECT RECRUITMENT DIVISION**

She opened it, expecting spam.

It was not spam.

A live call request appeared immediately after.

The holographic projection resolved into a calm, refined digital face.

“Good afternoon, Ms. Kelleher,” said the voice. “I am **J.A.R.V.I.S.** — Stark Industries Integrated Operations System. You have been awarded a full research scholarship and engineering fellowship at our Advanced Armor Development Lab.”

She froze.  
“…You’re serious.”

“I do not possess a sarcasm module,” JARVIS replied. “Mr. Stark personally reviewed your modular fabrication architecture.”

“My— my work?”

“Yes. He described it as — and I quote — ‘dangerously clever.’”

She laughed in disbelief.  
“That sounds like him.”

“Transportation arrangements are already in progress.”

Siobhán whispered to herself after the call ended:

“Okay. Don’t faint. Engineers don’t faint.”

She fainted.

# Stark Industries — Armor Division

New York roared louder than any Dublin storm. Stark Tower rose like a chrome spear into the clouds.

Siobhán walked through the lab floor in awe — dozens of armor variants, rescue rigs, space frames, deep sea models, and experimental nanotech systems under development.

A senior engineer approached.

“You’re the Irish prodigy,” he said. “I’m Dr. Morales. Welcome to the playground.”

“I think I might cry,” Siobhán admitted.

“Everyone does. First day only.”

She worked relentlessly — improving nano-routing efficiency, power distribution lattices, and self-healing circuit skins. Her specialty became **symbolic circuit architecture** — designing nanotech pathways that formed geometric patterns optimized for energy flow.

Tony Stark himself visited her station once, glanced at her holo-schematics, and smirked.

“Kid, your math is showing off.”

“Sir, that’s topology.”

“Exactly.”

# The Night of the Explosion

Three months into her fellowship, a classified prototype lab conducted a midnight test on **adaptive nano-matrix armor** — a system meant to assemble without an external suit shell.

Siobhán stayed late to observe.

Dr. Morales hesitated.  
“You’re off-shift.”

“I learn faster when things explode,” she said.

“That is not reassuring.”

The test began. Nanites swirled in a containment field like liquid chrome dust.

Then the power spiked.

“Voltage surge!” someone shouted.

“Shut it down!” Morales yelled.

Too late.

The containment lattice collapsed.

The nanites detonated outward in a concussive burst of light and sound.

Siobhán was thrown across the lab.

# The Hospital

Flatline alarms threatened the room.

“She’s crashing,” a doctor said. “Severe internal damage — lung collapse — cellular trauma —”

“She won’t survive transport,” another warned.

In the room’s monitoring system, a secure Stark protocol activated.

JARVIS spoke through the medical console:

“Emergency authorization override. Deploying experimental nano-recovery injection.”

The doctor hesitated.  
“This is unapproved tech!”

“Correction,” said JARVIS calmly. “It is now approved.”

A capsule deployed automatically.

Nanites entered Siobhán’s bloodstream.

# Becoming the Armor

Her heart restarted.

Her veins lit up like constellations.

Circuit patterns glowed beneath her skin — flowing lines of gold and white like living symbols.

Metallic lattice structures formed along her bones, reinforcing them.

Her breathing stabilized — assisted by nano-filament lung supports.

Her nervous system synchronized with the nanites.

She didn’t wear the armor.

**She became it.**

# Awakening

Siobhán’s eyes opened — glowing faint amber.

Tony Stark stood at the foot of the bed.

“Well,” he said softly, “that’s new.”

She sat up slowly.

“I can… hear electricity,” she whispered.

“Yeah,” Tony nodded. “That happens now.”

She looked at her hands. Circuit symbols pulsed across her skin like luminous tattoos.

“What did you do to me?”

Tony shook his head.  
“Not me. You and a lab accident did this. JARVIS saved your life with adaptive nanotech. It bonded.”

“Bonded how?”

“Integration level: terrifying.”

# The Iron Symbol Systems

In the lab, they ran tests.

“Okay,” Tony said. “Think about flight.”

“I don’t have jets.”

“You do now.”

**WHOOM**

Energy burst from the bottoms of her feet — controlled plasma thrust formed from nano-reactors along her arches and calves. She lifted gently, hovering.

She gasped.  
“I can vector the output — it’s like balancing equations!”

“Exactly,” Tony said. “You’re running armor math in your head.”

She raised her hands instinctively.

Twin repulsor arrays unfolded from glowing palm symbols — hard-light emitter rings formed by nanites.

“Power blast ready,” JARVIS reported.

She fired.

A focused beam punched through a test slab — clean, controlled.

Her suitless armor included:

* **Foot Boosters** — plasma vector flight with silent mode
* **Palm Repulsors** — variable yield energy blasts
* **Chest Core Symbol** — nano-reactor heart lattice
* **Backfold Shielding** — instant deploy energy wings
* **Circuit Skin** — self-healing nano-metal mesh
* **Symbolic Overdrive Mode** — full-body radiant armor state
* **Magnetic Grip** — wall and ceiling traversal
* **Nano Forge** — can fabricate tools and weapons from ambient metals
* **Signal Vision** — sees power grids, radio, heat, and EM fields
* **Hard-Light Constructs** — temporary shields and blades

“You turned topology into combat art,” Tony said.

She smiled slowly.  
“I always liked symbols.”

# Choosing a Name

“What do we call you?” Morales asked.

“Not Iron Girl,” Tony added. “Trademark nightmare.”

Siobhán looked at the glowing circuit patterns on her arms — intricate, geometric, alive.

“These are symbols,” she said. “Energy symbols. Logic symbols. Identity symbols.”

Tony nodded.  
“Go on.”

“I am **Iron Symbol**.”

“Yeah,” Tony said. “That works.”

# First Mission

A power grid collapse threatened Brooklyn. A sabotage drone swarm was draining substations.

Iron Symbol launched into the sky — silent — fast — precise.

Police radios crackled:

“Who is that?!”

“Not Iron Man — different signature —”

She landed beside the failing transformer and placed her glowing hand on it.

“JARVIS — route through me.”

“Advisory: load is extreme.”

“I know.”

Her body lit like a cathedral window.

She became the bridge — the conductor — the circuit.

Power stabilized across three boroughs.

A child watching from a window pointed upward.

“She looks like a star.”

# Afterward

On Stark Tower’s landing platform:

Tony handed her a mug of tea.

“You didn’t just survive,” he said. “You upgraded.”

She smiled.

“I didn’t build the suit,” she said quietly.  
“I became the design.”

Tony clinked his mug to hers.

“Welcome to the future, Iron Symbol.”

I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PLAY 20 QUESTIONS TO GET YOUR DRINK

it's not even the new people, they always order correctly. it's the people that come to dutch twice and expect me to read their mind with what they want to drink.

our menu is massive. there's so many options and everyone makes different drinks. that being said to make your broistas like easier order your drinks in this format; ""can i get a(iced, hot, blended), (size), (drink base (coffee tea lemonade rebel etc)), with (flavor)? (optional to add toppings""

The events, dialogues, and scenarios depicted are entirely a work of fiction and the product of the author's imagination. This is intended for entertainment purposes only and does not claim to represent real-life events or the actual thoughts of the individuals mentioned.\]**

**\[Intro / Summary\]** We all know the ""Clean Guy"" image Sidharth Malhotra works hard to maintain. He’s hyper-aware of cameras, mostly because he’s terrified of another ""foot-in-mouth"" experience. Contrast that with Barun Sobti, who is clean—effortlessly detached and naturally unbothered.

What happens when Sid tries to ""borrow"" Barun’s brooding energy to handle an interview with Parineeti Chopra, but she decides to hit him with the one thing he’s been avoiding for a decade? I’m talking about the 2014 *Ek Villain* weight-gain comment.

This is a meta-look at their friendship, the weight of old guilt, and the day the cameras refused to stop rolling.





**\[Author’s Foreword\]** ""In an industry of PR-gloss, some wounds are real. This story explores the chaotic bond between Sid and Pari, referencing their actual 2014 friction. It features a very confused Sidharth, a brilliant Parineeti, and the enigmatic Barun Sobti as the reluctant mentor for a guy who is just too 'nice' for his own good. Expect real Hinglish and a look at what happens when the 'Golden Retriever' tries to become a 'Wolf'."" — **Serial Fics**





**Setting:** A brightly lit, chic studio in Mumbai. The year is 2026. **Sidharth Malhotra** is looking sharp in a linen blazer, sitting across from his long-time friend and *Hasee Toh Phasee* co-star, **Parineeti Chopra**, who is guest-hosting the segment.





**EXT. STUDIO - DAY**

The ""ON AIR"" sign glows red. The camera pans from a poster of Sidharth’s new film to Parineeti, who is grinning widely. Sidharth looks relaxed, leaning back with a coffee mug.

**PARINEETI** (To camera) So, guys, today we have a very special guest. Isse aapne bohot roles mein dekha hai—soldier, spy, lover boy—par aaj, mere sawalon se bachne ke liye koi script nahi hai iske paas. Welcome, Sid!

**SIDHARTH** (Laughing) Thanks, Pari. Honestly, jab mujhe pata chala ki tum interview le rahi ho, I was 50% excited and 50% scared. Mujhe pata hai tumhare dimaag mein kya khuraafat chalti hai.

**PARINEETI** (Winking at the camera crew) Arre, trust me na! Hum toh purane dost hain. *Hasee Toh Phasee* se leke ab tak, nothing has changed.

They chat for a few minutes about the film. Sidharth is in his element, talking about the ""hard work"" and ""vision."" Parineeti keeps nodding, but her expression slowly starts to shift into something more serious, even slightly strained.

**PARINEETI:** (Smiling, but her eyes are sharp) Waise Sid, we’ve done two films together. Sabko lagta hai it’s all fun and games. But you know, sometimes words stay with you longer than movies do.

**SIDHARTH:** Deep, Pari. Very deep. Kya hua? Are you still mad I stole your protein bars on the *Jabariya Jodi* set?

**PARINEETI:** (She doesn't laugh. Her tone shifts to something raw.) Nahi. I was thinking about the *Ek Villain* promotions. Remember that interview? You joked about taking 'weight gain lessons' from me because you needed to bulk up... I was fighting depression and struggling so much back then, Sid. Everyone knew it. I thought my friend would have my back, not use my struggle as a punchline.

**SIDHARTH:** (The act shatters instantly. He looks at the camera, then back at her, eyes wide with 'innocent' panic.) Pari... that was a decade ago. I was just being stupid. I didn't mean it like that.

**PARINEETI:** (Her voice cracks. She looks at her cue cards, her hand visibly trembling.) I know. But you never said it to me. (She clears her throat, trying to stay professional) Anyway, next question... Fans want to know if—

She stops. Her eyes swim. She takes a shaky breath, pressing her lips together to stop the quiver.

**SIDHARTH** (Eyes widening, completely panicked) Hey... hey, Pari? Are you serious? Mike check? Guys, cut the cameras?

The crew stays silent, but the ""Live"" light stays on.

**SIDHARTH:** (Leaning in, his voice dropping to a frantic, breathy *sotto voce*. He’s whispering so the mics don't catch it, but his eyes are darting toward the crew.) Pari... listen. Yeh kya kar rahi hai? Not here, yaar. I know I messed up back then—I was an idiot, I was immature—but why bring this up *now*? (A beat of silence as he sees her shoulders shake) Pari, look at me. I’ve felt like a loser about that comment for years, trust me. Remember that party? I didn't even think twice before helping you with that wardrobe thing... I thought you knew that was my way of saying sorry. Please, don't do this live...

**PARINEETI:** (Cutting him off, voice thick) Protecting my clothes isn't the same as protecting my dignity, Sid. (Whispering) I can’t do this... Give me a minute.

She turns away, burying her face in her hands. Her shoulders heave in silent, rhythmic sobs.

**SIDHARTH:** (Pale-faced. He gestures wildly to the crew.) Guys... cut the cams. Cut them! Band karo yaar, she’s actually upset! Is this still live?!

The crew doesn't move. The ""LIVE"" light stays red. One camera zooms in on Sidharth’s horrified face as he realizes his ""Clean Guy"" image is evaporating in 4K.

I thought discipline was the answer.

Instead, I gained \~20 pounds.

What I didn’t realize back then was how much my menstrual cycle affects energy, recovery, stress, and fat loss. I was training the same way every day, even during my luteal phase, when my body is way more sensitive to stress.

The biggest shift for me was adjusting workouts to my cycle:

* harder training when energy is naturally higher
* more yoga, walking, and calmer movement during luteal

Once I stopped forcing intensity all month, things finally changed. Weight started coming off, cravings eased, sleep improved, and workouts stopped feeling like punishment.

What really helped was using a hormone-aware health app that explains *why* my body feels different week to week and suggests training that actually supports it.

Yes i fell for you

Yes i feel for you

You don’t respond so I left you alone

I came here to share parts of myself anonymously

Freely without judgment

To read others stories

But i can’t shake that you’re here , and maybe mocked me.

Please know I wish only good things for you

Drew up 2 coffee table designs in Onshape for some walnut slabs. 2nd one was inspired by

u/Dangnamit ‘s white oak and concrete side table. Torn between the 2.

Would either of these bases lend themselves to a live edge tabletop? Or would I be better off cutting the live edge off and having a straight chamfered edge?

If I went with the 2nd design would I be fine attaching the top with z clips along the stretchers? Or would those present problems aside from being visible from the side

Lastly, to anyone who’s made a bottom shelf like that, how would you attach all those pieces to the bottom stretchers? ",3,1770753116.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,7,0.8,False

League: Los Angeles Clippers vs Houston Rockets (7PM CST on NBA TV)

**Recap**: Lakers were competitive enough to win this game, but OKC had too much firepower beyond the arc and wit J-Dub back in the lineup this was an issue for the Lakers to close out the game. 

[](https://preview.redd.it/potd-thunder-vs-lakers-v0-w626zuoafjig1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c86b6fca2b553bd0492f6ad5cee82f8fac4b7eea)

**Matchup:** Running my best bets for this week as promised! And today my best bet is on Alperen Sengun 10+ Rebounds against the Clippers. This is a very favorable matchup for Alphie! **Rockets are the best rebounding team in the league.** Yes, they loss Steven Adams for the season, but Sengun is a viable rebounder even offensively. He doesn't average 10 boards a game this season, but this is a mismatch. There isn't a reason why he should not get at least 10 boards against the Clippers. **Conversely the Clips are weakest rebounding team in the league and they traded away their Center Ivica Zubac. Brook Lopez is one the weakest rebounding centers. Granted that he has only started a few games this season, but if you look at his stats from last season he struggled to get 5+ rebounds a game as a starter wit the Bucks.** It's not so much that he doesn't put much effort in to getting boards, it's really his positioning. Lopez loves to camp around corner of the court for a 3-point shot, so there's hardly a chance at getting offensive rebounds off a missed shots. Sengun on the other hand camps in the perimeter which gives him ton of opportunities for rebounds. Let's also look at the historical matchup against the Clips.

https://preview.redd.it/uy3r81pnzpig1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&s=96273bc68eb88c6376c11bd76db42a756d2b8e1f

**Sengun has rebounded 10+ Rebs in 5 of his last 7 games and he rebounded 12 boards in a tougher matchup on his last game vs the Thunder. He's got a easier matchup against the Clippers this time and he's dominated his previous matchup against Zubat in his last 6 meetings, but now faces a lesser rebounding threat in Brook Lopez.** 

[Covered in the previous 6 matchups and now he faces a lesser rebounder threat in Lopez.](https://preview.redd.it/qzwczqoi0qig1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=b77eff5071c3955ce76d17f69f2392ca68e9c63c)

**The Play & Prediction :** I'm confident on Sengun and willing to wager 2U on Alperen Sengun 10+ Rebounds. Sengun records 6 rebounds in the 1st half and 5 in the 2nd half.

This morning I used my Hario Switch/Mugen and poured two Coffee Chronicler based cups. One was the Sumatran Mandhelian from Happy Mug. The other was a Costa Rican Honey processed anaerobic  from FreshRoast coffee that Sam picked for me. 

I almost didn't start roasting because one Redditor said it would be years before I got the results that my local roaster  provided. 

Humbug  Now, it might be that I don't have the buds to appreciate the difference between my roast and the local pros.

But, honestly  both cups this morning were awesome.  9 to 9.5 out of ten for me. 

The Costs Rican may go to 10 since it has only restef 5 days. Get swirling citrus, berries and stone fruit notes. I was enjoying the coffee, so I didn't hurt my head trying to identify which berries or fruit. Maybe later.

I thought I didn't liked Sumatrans based on a bag  I bought a year ago. It tasted dirty, not earthy. This cup was molasses, cinnamon and trad coffee - super balanced and great body and mouth feel.

TBH, except for one batch out of the 25 I've roasted so far,  to my tastes, have all been better on average, than those Ive bought from various roaster's the last 3 years.

Except for RogueWave coffees. I don't want to get ridiculous here. :-)

Even a decaf that I severely under roasted, has been quite drinkable after aging 3 weeks.

Maybe the greens I am buying are of higher quality than the roasted beans I've been buying?

I can't wait to taste the coffee I roast once I really know what I'm doing. 

BTW, the Captains Corner provided really excellent videos on roasting with the SR800 for different processed coffees. The Coffee Corral and the Virtual Coffe Lab videos have also been helpful. 

Thanks to all here for the encouragement and guidance that led to some spectacular cups. I've been enjoying my coffee more consistently since I started roasting with you.

I was thirty-two, sitting in a Honda dealership off Route 17, signing paperwork I didn’t need to sign. A pen on a counter. Fluorescent lights that made everyone’s skin look slightly gray. A salesman with a forced laugh and a tie that kept drifting crooked like it hated being there too. I had spent the last ten minutes arguing—calmly, politely, like I was ordering a sandwich—that I didn’t want a “protection package” and that no, I wasn’t paying extra for floor mats that came with the car anyway.

I’d done this before.

Not in the normal way—like “I bought a car once” before. I mean every word, every pause, every little motion of his hand when he tapped the brochure had already been in my body. Like my muscles remembered.

My stomach turned over, slow and heavy, because I realized I could predict what he’d say next.

“Listen,” he was saying, “I’m just trying to take care of you. People don’t think about… you know. What if—”

“What if a deer runs into the side of it,” I finished, at the exact same time he did, and he blinked at me like I’d reached into his mouth and pulled the sentence out.

He laughed. “Man, you must sell cars.”

I didn’t. I worked in inventory for a warehouse that shipped medical supplies. Or… I had. I couldn’t even tell, in that moment, if that was still true.

I dropped the pen. It clacked against the counter and rolled. The sound felt too loud in the little office.

In the window, between the glossy poster of a smiling couple and the row of cars outside, I saw my reflection.

I looked normal. Tired. Stubble I should’ve shaved. A scar at the edge of my eyebrow from a bike accident when I was nine. Same guy.

So why did my heart feel like it was running from something?

I pushed the paperwork away.

“I can’t,” I said.

The salesman’s smile faltered. “Can’t what?”

“I can’t do this.” My throat tightened, because I realized what I meant wasn’t “I can’t buy the car.” It was everything. The whole day. The whole week. The whole stretch of time my brain was insisting had already happened.

I stood up too fast. The chair scraped.

The salesman started talking again—something about deposits and financing—but his voice blurred, because I heard something else. Not in the dealership. Not through the wall. Something that wasn’t a sound so much as a pressure behind my ears.

A countdown.

Not numbers spoken out loud. Just a sense of time snapping into place like a trap being set.

Five years.

That phrase hit me out of nowhere, sharp as a slap.

Five years and then it comes.

I left without explaining. I walked out into the lot and the air felt like winter even though it was April. The sky was that flat, overcast gray that makes everything look like it’s waiting.

I got into my car—my old car, the one with the cracked dash—and my hands were shaking so badly I had to sit there and breathe.

That was Cycle One, I guess. The one where I still believed in normal explanations.

I went to a doctor. I did scans. I took pills. I did therapy. I avoided caffeine. I did everything you do when your brain starts betraying you.

And then, five years later, it found me.

I’m not telling you “five years later” like it was a neat little skip. I lived those five years. I aged through them. I watched my hairline change in the mirror and I felt the dull ache in my knees when it rained. I made friends. I lost touch with people. I paid bills. I watched shows. I had a relationship that ended because we wanted different things and she cried in my kitchen and I stood there holding a dish towel like it could save me.

The world didn’t feel fake. That’s the part that screws with you. It wasn’t a dream you wake up from. It was life. Regular, boring, stupid life.

Until the last day.

It was a Tuesday. I know because I’d been annoyed I had to work late and I’d promised myself I’d start meal prepping on Wednesdays. I stopped at a Sunoco after work—the kind with the little convenience store that sells hot dogs that have been turning on metal rollers for hours. I bought a coffee even though it tasted like burned plastic, and the receipt printed with that thin heat-paper font that fades if you leave it in your car.

I remember the stupid detail because later I tried to keep one. I tried to prove it to myself.

When I walked out, my car wouldn’t start. The engine turned over and then quit, like it was choking.

I tried again. Same thing.

I sat there with the key in my hand, staring at my dashboard lights.

And I knew. Not guessed. Knew.

Because that same pressure behind my ears was back, stronger now, like the air itself was leaning in.

It’s here.

I got out of the car. The parking lot was mostly empty. A guy in a hoodie was walking into the store. Two semis idled by the pumps, their engines rumbling low.

Nothing looked wrong. No storm. No sirens. No dramatic build.

Then I saw it across the street, on the edge of the woods that bordered the highway.

At first my brain refused to label it. It was too tall, too thin, too wrong to be a person.

It stepped out from between the trees like it had been waiting politely for me to notice.

Ten feet, at least. Maybe more. Emaciated in a way that didn’t look like starvation so much as something had pulled it apart and forgot to put it back together. Its arms were too long, hanging almost to its knees. Its chest was a narrow cage. Its skin was pale and stretched tight over bone like shrink wrap over leftovers.

No clothes. No hair. No eyes.

Just smooth skin where eye sockets should’ve been, like someone had pressed them flat.

And a mouth.

A long, grinning mouth that cut across its face. Not a smile like a person. A grin like a rip. The lips were thin, cracked, and pulled back far enough that I saw teeth that looked too many and too small, like a row of broken piano keys.

It didn’t move fast. It didn’t need to.

It tilted its head slightly, as if listening, and then it started walking toward the gas station.

Straight line. No hesitation.

A man with a normal brain would’ve screamed. I didn’t. I stood there with coffee in my hand, frozen, because a chunk of me kept insisting it was impossible.

Then it crossed the road without looking for cars, stepping between moving vehicles like it knew they wouldn’t hit it. A pickup swerved and honked. The driver leaned out the window to yell something and then slammed on the brakes, not because he wanted to, but because his body decided for him.

He stared.

The creature didn’t look at him. Didn’t even turn its head.

It just kept coming for me.

I dropped my coffee. The cup hit the ground and splashed dark liquid across the concrete.

And I ran.

I ran behind the convenience store, past a dumpster that smelled like sour milk and fryer grease, and I kept going, because there was nowhere else to go. I heard footsteps behind me—not heavy, not pounding, just a steady, soft slap like bare feet on wet pavement.

The thing didn’t breathe. I didn’t hear panting. I didn’t hear effort.

I cut around the side of the building, sprinted into the lot, and almost collided with the guy in the hoodie. His eyes went wide at my face and he stepped back like I had blood on me.

“I need help,” I said. My voice came out too high, almost childish. “Call—call someone. Call the police.”

He started reaching for his phone, but then his gaze flicked over my shoulder.

His hand froze.

Whatever he saw behind me drained the color from his face like someone had pulled a plug.

He didn’t run. He didn’t scream. He just stood there, phone halfway out of his pocket, staring.

The creature reached us, and it didn’t lunge or swipe like an animal.

It simply stepped closer, and the air around it felt thinner. Like oxygen got distracted.

My knees softened. I stumbled backward. The world narrowed to the shape of its mouth and the empty, eyeless skin above it.

It leaned down. Not to smell me. Not to whisper.

Just leaned down like you lean in to read a label.

And then—

There’s a gap in my memory there. Not because I blacked out. Because the next thing that happened wasn’t “the next thing.” It was the beginning.

I woke up on a different morning, in a different bed, with a different phone buzzing on the nightstand.

I sat up so fast I got dizzy.

Outside the window, sunlight. Birds. A normal day.

My phone’s lock screen showed a date.

Five years earlier.

I laughed out loud, one short bark, because my brain couldn’t decide if that was relief or hysteria.

I checked my reflection in the bathroom mirror and saw I was five years younger again. The tiny lines near my eyes were gone. My shoulders didn’t ache when I moved.

I stood there gripping the sink so hard my knuckles went white, and I understood something that felt too big to fit into words.

It reset.

Five years, and then it resets.

And it comes for me at the end.

I don’t know if it’s infinite. I don’t know if there’s a number where it stops. I just know I keep waking up at the start, and I keep hoping one of these mornings will be the last time.

That was when I started keeping notes.

Not a journal in the poetic sense. A system. Lists. Hard dates. Things only I would know so I couldn’t talk myself out of it later.

In one cycle, I set up a Gmail draft to myself with a subject line I’d never write by accident: “READ THIS FIRST: FIVE-YEAR RESET / EYELSS \\\[sic\\\] GIANT.” I left the typo on purpose. I attached a photo of my own face and circled my scar with a red markup tool like a lunatic. I wrote down the dealership moment, the coffee taste, the hoodie guy’s frozen hand.

When the reset happened, that draft didn’t exist. The account wasn’t logged in. The phone was a different model. The typo never got to exist.

That’s when I learned the rule that keeps ruining every “proof” plan:

The loop doesn’t preserve my tools.

It preserves me.

The world rearranges around my decisions. Like a slot machine that spins the same reels but stops on different symbols.

One cycle, I stayed in my warehouse job. Another cycle, I quit on impulse and went back to school. I became a teacher for three years, teaching ninth grade English in a school that smelled like pencil shavings and cafeteria pizza. I had a classroom. A desk. Students who made jokes and complained about essays. I thought, in that cycle, maybe being around kids—being grounded—would stop the spiral in my head.

It didn’t.

At the end of that cycle, it found me in the school parking lot.

It was winter. Snow piled against the curbs in dirty gray slabs. I’d stayed late grading papers, the building mostly empty except for the custodian pushing a mop bucket down the hall, humming under his breath. I walked out with my bag slung over my shoulder, thinking about whether I was going to stop at ShopRite.

I saw it standing by my car like it belonged there.

No eyes. That grin.

The snow around its feet was melted in a perfect oval, like heat radiated off it, but its skin looked cold.

I dropped my bag and tried to run back into the building.

The door wouldn’t open.

Not locked. Not stuck. It was like the handle wasn’t connected to anything. Like the building had decided I didn’t get to go inside.

The custodian’s humming stopped.

I turned my head and saw him at the end of the hallway through the glass, staring at me. Staring past me. His mouth was slightly open.

He didn’t move to help.

The creature stepped closer.

Reset.

Another cycle, I did the thing I never thought I’d do: I turned my life into content.

I became an influencer. I hate even typing that word, because it makes me sound like a joke, and honestly, that cycle was my worst five years in terms of dignity.

I started with fitness videos because it was easy to sell. People want transformation. People want simple routines. People want someone to tell them the secret is discipline and a powder you can buy from my link.

I sold protein powder. I sold “wellness stacks.” I posed with tubs of supplements like they were trophies. I took pictures in gyms with good lighting and pretended my confidence was natural.

I made money. That’s the gross part. It worked.

By year three, I had a small following. People recognized me at grocery stores and asked if I was “that guy.” My DMs were full of strangers calling me “king” and asking what brand of blender I used.

I thought maybe if I became a different enough person, the thing wouldn’t recognize me.

At the end of that cycle, it found me anyway.

It came during a livestream.

I was in my apartment, ring light on, camera angled just right, talking about “mindset” like I was qualified to talk about anything.

I noticed the comments slow down.

Not stop. Slow, like people were distracted by something off-screen.

Someone typed: bro wtf is behind you

I glanced at the chat, smiled like it was a joke, and turned my head.

In the reflection of the dark TV screen behind me, I saw it standing in my hallway.

Tall enough its head nearly brushed the ceiling.

No eyes.

That grin.

I lunged for my phone, knocked it off the tripod, and the live feed spun, showing carpet, showing my bare feet, showing my hand scrabbling for the device like it was going to save me.

I heard no footsteps. Just that steady, soft slap.

Then the phone camera caught a glimpse of it as it stepped over the fallen tripod.

Chat exploded. People screaming in text. Emojis. “IS THIS REAL” and “CALL 911” and “THIS IS SICK.”

I screamed for the first time in any cycle, raw and ugly, because there was no pretending now.

The last thing I remember before the reset was its mouth opening wider than it should’ve been able to, like the grin was a door.

Then the world snapped back to the beginning.

After enough cycles, you stop trying “normal” fixes.

I tried the big solutions.

In one cycle, I got rich on purpose. Not influencer rich. Real rich. I made a series of investments that, after enough loops, I learned how to time. I bought before spikes. I sold before crashes. I played the system like I had a cheat code because I did.

By year four, I had enough money to hire people who normally don’t answer emails from someone like me.

Scientists. Researchers. Private labs. A neurologist who smelled like expensive cologne and didn’t believe me until I predicted a freak hailstorm down to the hour.

I flew them out to a rented house in the mountains. Two physicists, a neuroscientist, a guy who worked in some government-adjacent lab and kept asking me where my funding came from.

They recorded everything.

They monitored my sleep. They asked about toxins. They took blood samples. They talked about time dilation and quantum branching and the idea that reality could be a series of decision trees.

One of them—the neuroscientist, Dr. Khan—sat across from me at a long dining table one night and said, “Even if we confirm you’re in a loop, that doesn’t mean we can alter it. We might only be passengers.”

“I don’t need you to alter it,” I said. “I need you to tell me what it is. And what that thing is.”

His face tightened. “You keep calling it a ‘thing.’”

“Because if I call it a man, I’ll throw up.”

They tried to set traps. They tried to find patterns. They tried to locate it early in the cycle.

We never saw it until the end.

It was like it didn’t exist until it did.

The last month of that cycle, they moved me into a reinforced facility rented from a company that specializes in “secure storage.” Concrete walls. Steel doors. Cameras. Motion sensors. Armed guards who thought they were protecting a rich guy from kidnapping.

I sat in a chair in the center of the main room with electrodes on my scalp and watched the camera feeds, waiting for the countdown pressure to start.

It did.

The guards kept joking about it, like nervous men do.

Then every camera went to static at once.

Not one. All of them.

The lights didn’t flicker. They stayed on. The power was fine. The cameras simply stopped showing reality.

The steel door at the far end of the corridor—the one that was rated to withstand a truck slamming into it—made a sound.

Not a bang. Not a crash.

A soft, deliberate scrape, like fingernails on metal.

Then the door opened.

Not blown open. Not pried open. It swung inward like someone had turned the handle.

It stepped into the corridor, ducking its head slightly to clear the frame.

No eyes. That grin.

One guard fired. The gunshots were deafening in the confined space. The smell of gunpowder filled the air so fast it made my eyes water.

The bullets hit it. I saw them strike skin. I saw the way its flesh dented and then smoothed.

It didn’t bleed.

It didn’t flinch.

It didn’t even turn its head toward the shooter.

It just kept walking toward me.

The guards’ screams were the worst part, because they weren’t brave-soldier screams. They were human animal noise. Panic. Disbelief.

I tried to run. I got maybe three steps before my legs went weak like someone had turned off the signal to my muscles.

It stopped in front of me.

Dr. Khan shouted something behind me, but his voice sounded far away, like he was underwater.

The creature leaned down again, close enough I smelled it.

Not rot. Not death.

Something dry. Like dust in an old attic. Like paper left in the sun.

Its mouth opened.

Reset.

After that, I tried spiritual.

One was a woman outside Santa Fe.

I remember her because she didn’t act impressed. She didn’t act greedy. She didn’t act like I’d handed her a story she could monetize.

She acted tired.

Her place was a one-story adobe-looking house with a chain-link fence and a yard full of scrubby plants that looked like they survived out of spite. Inside, the air smelled like dry sage and hot dust. No incense fog. No dramatic candles everywhere. Just one table in the center of a room with a packed dirt floor and a ceiling fan that squeaked on every rotation.

She introduced herself as Marisol. She was maybe late fifties, hair braided back, hands stained with something dark that could’ve been dye or soil. She watched me sit down like she was already measuring how fast I’d run.

I told her the truth. All of it. The five years. The reset. The thing.

She didn’t interrupt. She didn’t smile. She didn’t lean in.

When I finished, she said, “Describe its face.”

“No eyes,” I said. “Just skin. Smooth. And a mouth. A grin.”

“How tall.”

“Ten feet. Taller. Like it shouldn’t fit through doors, but it does.”

Marisol nodded once, like that checked a box she didn’t like.

She got up, walked to a shelf, and pulled down a shallow bowl. In the bowl was a gray powder that looked like ash, and a small glass vial with a cork.

She came back and set them on the table.

“Blood,” she said.

I stared at her.

“I’m not asking you because it’s dramatic,” she said. “I’m asking because if you don’t give it willingly, something else will take it.”

She slid a thin craft razor across the table.

I cut my palm shallow. Blood welled, dark and glossy.

Marisol held the bowl steady. “Let it fall.”

I let three drops fall into the ash.

The ash absorbed it like thirsty dirt.

Marisol poured the contents of the vial—clear liquid—into the bowl. The ash turned into a paste, thick and gray, with tiny red streaks.

She dipped two fingers into it and drew a circle on the table, right between us. Not a fancy symbol. Just a plain ring.

Then she looked up at me and said, “This isn’t a curse.”

“What is it,” I whispered.

“It’s a boundary,” she said. “You’re hitting the same boundary over and over.”

“A boundary with what?”

“With something that owns the end of you.”

My skin went cold. “That thing—”

“It’s not chasing you because it hates you,” she said. “It’s chasing you because it’s what comes next.”

“Can you stop it.”

Marisol stared at the circle she’d drawn like she didn’t want to touch it again.

“No,” she said. “But I can ask a question.”

“What question.”

She pressed her fingers to the ring of paste and whispered under her breath. Spanish, maybe, mixed with words I didn’t recognize. Flat, controlled, like she was reading a receipt.

The ceiling fan squeaked overhead.

My ears popped.

Not in the normal pressure way. Sharper. Like someone shoved a finger into both ear canals at the same time.

Marisol stopped mid-whisper. Her face blanched. She lifted her hand from the circle and stared at her fingers.

The paste on them was drying too fast, cracking like old mud.

She met my eyes and said, “It heard.”

My heart slammed. “Who heard?”

Marisol stood so fast her chair scraped. “Get out.”

“What—Marisol, what did you—”

“Get out,” she snapped, voice rising for the first time. “Leave my house.”

I stood, dizzy. “Is it coming now?”

“No,” she said, and the way she said it made it worse. “But you just made it aware that you’re trying.”

“But you said it isn’t aware.”

Marisol’s eyes flicked to the hallway behind me, then back to my face. “It doesn’t remember cycles,” she said. “That’s not the same thing.”

“What did I do.”

“You knocked,” she said. “And something on the other side moved.”

I left. I remember my shoes crunching grit on her porch. I remember the sun feeling too bright. I remember getting into my rental car and sitting there with my hands on the wheel until my knuckles hurt.

I never went back.

At the end of that cycle, it still came.

Now, you might be asking what the “beginning” is. What moment starts the five years.

It’s always normal.

Not a lab. Not lightning. Not a monster sighting.

I wake up on a morning that feels like any other. Different bed sometimes. Different apartment sometimes. Different city once.

But the same me.

And the same sense, like there’s a script I’m supposed to follow that I keep messing up.

The only consistent thing is the pressure behind my ears when the end gets close. It starts faint about a week out—like a headache that comes and goes. Then it gets stronger, and stronger, until it feels like the air itself is squeezing.

This cycle, it started earlier.

That’s why I’m posting now.

In the first month of each cycle, I will see—somewhere, somehow—a man in a red windbreaker holding a white plastic bag.

Sometimes he’s on a sidewalk. Sometimes he’s in a grocery store line. Sometimes he’s crossing a parking lot.

He always looks like he’s in a hurry. He always glances at me like he recognizes me, then looks away like he decided he doesn’t.

In the current cycle, I saw him at a Target in Paramus, three months in. Notebook aisle. Clearance stickers. He looked right at me and his expression did something small and ugly—pity, maybe—and then he disappeared into the crowd.

That’s how normal it stays.

Until it doesn’t.

This week, I started preparing like I always do, even though it has never worked.

Energy drinks. Protein bars. A first-aid kit. Running shoes.

And a body camera.

Last night I tested it by recording myself in my kitchen saying the date out loud and holding up today’s mail. When I played it back, everything looked fine except for a thin line of static across the top of the frame that only showed up near the end of the clip.

This morning, I woke up with dried blood under my nose.

I checked the date. I counted days.

Five.

This afternoon, I was walking past the laundromat with the broken “OPEN” sign. The air smelled like dryer exhaust and stale detergent. A TV inside played a daytime talk show too loud. I stopped at the crosswalk because the light was red.

A woman stood next to me with two grocery bags. She looked tired. She kept adjusting her grip like the handles were digging into her fingers.

Behind us, a car idled, bass thumping so low it vibrated the air.

Everything was normal.

Then the woman beside me went rigid.

She didn’t scream. She didn’t turn around dramatically. She just went still, like her muscles locked.

I glanced at her face. Her eyes were wide. She was staring across the street.

Her lips moved.

“What…” she whispered.

I turned my head.

Across the street, between a parked delivery van and the brick wall of a closed bank, there was a narrow gap of shadow that shouldn’t have been that dark in daylight.

In that shadow, something tall shifted.

It wasn’t fully there. Not the way it is at the end. It was like the outline of it was trying to form, and the air was resisting.

But I saw long arms.

Pale skin.

And the mouth.

That long, grinning cut of teeth, hovering in the dark like a smear of white.

The woman stumbled backward. Grocery bags slipped from her hands. A jar of pasta sauce shattered on the concrete. Red splashed like an accident.

The car behind us honked, impatient.

The thing in the shadow moved forward an inch.

My ears popped—hard—like someone shoved pressure into my skull and twisted. Pain flashed down my jaw. My vision narrowed. The street tilted.

I clapped a hand to my right ear and felt warm wetness.

Blood.

My hearing in that ear dropped to a muffled roar, like I’d gone underwater.

That’s new. That’s the cost.

And for the first time, it didn’t feel like the loop was waiting for the last day.

It felt like I’d just touched something I wasn’t supposed to touch.

I ran.

I sprinted down the street, past the vape shop and the nail salon and the pizza place with the greasy smell. I heard someone shout after me.

I made it back to my apartment building and slammed through the front door, nearly shoulder-checking an old man coming out. He cursed at me. I didn’t stop.

I took the stairs two at a time, my right ear ringing so loud it drowned out everything, and got inside my apartment, locking the deadbolt, then the chain like it was going to matter.

I stood in my living room, chest heaving, and waited.

The pressure in my head didn’t ease.

I walked to my window and looked down at the street.

Across the street, by the bank, a small crowd had gathered.

They were pointing at the gap between the van and the wall. Some had their phones out.

And in the middle of them, standing completely still, was a man in a red windbreaker holding a white plastic bag.

He wasn’t looking at the shadow.

He was looking up.

At my window.

His face wasn’t confused or curious.

It was flat. Like he’d been waiting for this.

He raised his free hand and made a small motion.

Come down.

Or maybe: you shouldn’t have run.

Then he turned and walked away into the crowd, disappearing like he’d never been there.

I looked back at the gap of shadow.

Nothing.

No mouth. No outline. Just daylight and brick and the side of a van.

But the woman’s jar of sauce was still broken on the sidewalk.

The people were still pointing like they couldn’t stop themselves.

My right ear was still bleeding, slow and warm.

I clipped the body camera to my chest and pressed the button until the tiny red light came on.

The muffled roar in my right ear hasn’t stopped.

And I can hear bare feet in my hallway now.

Soft. Steady.

we are no longer seeing one another after he abruptly ended things, which is why i wanted to provide the context of this not being retaliation.

it is so discouraging to be that ignored, to the point that within the past week two other partners have addressed the way he has been treating me.

 A degree in wildlife management. It sounds so exciting, and the $70,000 piece of paper has certainly ensnared many bright, nature-loving youths with the allure of grand vistas and endless adventures, and I am one who heard the sirens call. From a young age, I knew people weren’t for me. I craved the solitude of an untouched meadow or grove of trees; my favorite companions were clothed in feathers and fur. This disdain for my own kind only increased after I weathered the tempest that is high school. College was a necessary evil, a four-year send-off to my life in the wilderness. I was destined to be a park ranger, a guardian of the woods, and a caretaker of the natural world. In the world of man, I was nothing. But in the world of the beasts, I was to be its master. These were the thoughts of grandeur that filled my head the night before graduation.



 Two years later, they were replaced with an overwhelming dread of life, as I sat in my car waiting to start my shift at the local Arby’s. The greatest killer of a man’s dreams is student loan debt, of which I had a seemingly endless mountain of, and for a nature-loving person, a career in fast food is the worst kind of purgatory. An endless, looping cycle of identical days of being forced to remain inside all day and care for people whose own weight would rival that of the great American buffalo, and who would gladly bite off my head in place of their burger if they didn’t receive it within 3 minutes. I clocked in for my third night shift this week, and the one bright spot of my night was that today I got to work with my only friend in the entire Arby’s corporation, Hank.

 “One day closer to quitting,” I said as I logged into the system with my employee number. 

“Or one day closer to dying,” came the retort from Hank.

 Misery loves company, and perhaps that's why Hank and I get along so well. He’s just as miserable as I am. Years of drug and alcohol abuse haven’t been kind to Hank, the 27-year-old resembles more of a withered corpse than a man in his prime years. His pale, thin face and lifeless, slightly cloudy eyes had the appearance of the work of a poorly trained embalmer rather than that of a living person. Due to his off-putting appearance, our manager, Maddie, found it best to give Hank the privilege of permanent burger flipper in order to keep him out of sight of customers. I myself was assigned to the drive-thru window. 

“That will $35.60, Sir,” I said to our first customer in 3 hours. 

“That’s more than last time,” mumbled the man in return.

 “yes, inflation has hit us hard sir” I replied as I silently judged this behemoth of a man, who I’m sure plans to eat the 4 burgers and three large fries all by himself.

 “well, here you go I guess” he said as he handed me his card.

 I was annoyed that this customer had interrupted my only enjoyment for the night: partaking in Hank’s drug-induced rambles about his favorite conspiracy theories. 

“Yo, Nate, did you know that the Earth is hollow? My sister’s brother-in-law just told me that, and he’s a scientist, so I guess it’s like common knowledge or something, but I just never knew that man.”

 I quickly rolled my eyes and smirked. Of course, Hank’s meth cooking ‘scientist’ brother-in-law would tell him something like that. My response dripped with sarcasm, 

“No, Hank, I’ve never heard of that, sounds pretty scientific though.” 

 “Yeah, I know, man, that’s pretty bizarre that you didn’t know that, what with you studying like nature and stuff, sounds like there’s loads of like creatures and weird stuff down there too.”

 While I didn’t really appreciate Hank reminding me of my unused degree and dying dreams, I simply replied, 

“That so? What sort of creatures?” 

“Oh man, it’s got to be like Bigfoot, I’m telling you that’s why no one has found where he lives, cause he lives under the ground, man.” 

“The only bigfoot you two should worry about is the one I’ll plant up you’re butts if you don’t get back to work!” Maddie sure has a way with words. And the heavy-set single mother of three loved to make sure our job was a prison-like as possible. 

“we don’t pay you two to yap, we pay you to work!” 

that inspiring speech was enough to return my focus to rewashing the already clean countertop, and pretending to restock the already stocked condiment compartments. And Hank passionately cleaned the grills as if they were a priceless sports car. If there was ever a place where time stands still, it had to be inside the Arby’s off of I-90 in Oacoma, South Dakota.

1 AM finally came, and with it, the end of my shift. As Hank and I stepped out into the brisk April night, the words I had grown accustomed to finally came from Hank’s lips. 

“Yo, Nate, can I have a ride? The buses don’t run this late, man.” 

 With a smile, I said, “Sure thing, hop in.” We both hopped into my 2003 Kia Optima and started our journey through the quiet darkness of the night. I always enjoyed the drives we took and the conversation that came with it; it was some of the only genuine human interaction I had had since dad died, and mom was put in a home. They had always supported me and pushed me to pursue my dreams, but when Dad died, I couldn’t bear to see Mom’s mind fade like the dying embers of a drenched campfire. Dementia had taken my mom, leaving nothing but a dry husk. A husk that I couldn’t bear to see, which is why I was in South Dakota and the nursing home was in Missouri.

 “bro, if Bigfoot got together with Moth man, would the babies be giant bugs or apes with bug-like features?” Hank’s question shattered my introspection, and I couldn’t help but smile.

 “I don’t know if the two would be biologically compatible, man.”

 “Ha, classic Nate, always the rational thinker, but maybe you’re right, so maybe instead it’s Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster.”

 For the next ten minutes, Hank’s mindless theories and ramblings filled the cabin of my small car, as I began to zone out, a surprisingly sober question found its way to my ears. 

“Nate, do you ever regret never using you’re degree?”

 Caught off guard, I gave the first answer that came to mind: 

“Yes, every day I regret it."" 

“So why don’t you take that degree and get out of here?”

 I thought for a while, not sure how to answer. Some time ago, I had suppressed my childhood dreams and longing for adventure, and came to grips with the sad adult reality that adventures only happened to someone else on a screen. I quietly responded, 

“Life isn’t very kind to the dreams of a child.”

 “Well, sure, man, if you give up on them, I know you can’t stand this place, and I know that it’s easy to leave the dream behind, but honestly, man, this place will kill you, it’s already killed you’re goals in life, but don’t let it kill the rest of you. So maybe you need to pick up that childhood dream again and get out where you belong.”

 The insightful words of my drug-loving friend had just enough time to take root in my mind when the bright lights flooded my vision, and the impact of a pickup truck slammed into the side of my ancient vehicle, scumbling the cabin of the car as if it were an empty Coke can. So very bright, and then suddenly so very dark.

Hank was gone. His death came swiftly as his right kneecap rocketed through his neck and skull at the speed of a bullet. All that remained of my friend was a mangled, fleshy chew toy, a soupy mess of yellowed ground beef and separated vertebrae. The four-wheeled weapon of mass destruction was wielded by a ranch hand who spent the night hopping from bar to bar, trying to get lucky with the town’s sad selection of single women. Yet even they had standards he couldn’t meet, defeated, he mounted his metal steed filled with enough cheap beer to start his own brewery, and ventured into the night. In his final moments, he enjoyed a gas station cigarillo and Jason Aldean. Then, in a moment, his head was transformed into a battering ram waging war against the wall of glass before him. His head won. It stormed the glass barricade and, having freed itself from its tyranny, his cranium reached its final resting place, splattered across the side of my Kia.

 My dead friend left two lasting impacts on my life. The first came as his meatball of a corpse was launched at my left forearm. The resulting impact snapped my ulna and radius as though they were twigs into three equal parts, which in turn folded in on itself as if it were a tri-fold pamphlet. Hank’s final hug not only crumpled my forearm but also shattered the right side of my ribcage and collapsed my lung, a twisted final gift from a passing friend. The second impact was that of Hank’s final words, ‘get out where you belong.’ They were the final thought on my mind as the darkness set in, and the first directive that my mind found as the cold light of my hospital room called me back to the land of the living.

I was born again. At Arby’s, my life withered away, yet at death's door, I was baptized in blood and emerged a changed man. A man called to a new station in life, a prophet of the angel of death. The revelation I had received from the realm of death was etched on my mind: ‘get out where you belong,’ and I would forsake everything to keep that one command. The weeks in the hospital were a special kind of trial; it made Arby’s look like paradise, yet I knew this, too, would pass. By some miracle, my phone survived the wreck, and I used it to form my resume. The post-it note-sized document then became my tool to apply for the position I was born for: United States Park Ranger. 2 days before my release from the hospital, I received a call. 

“Hello?”

 “Hello,” a gruff voice responded, “Am I speaking to Nathan Diaz?”

 “Yessir, that’s me,” I answered with as much courage as I could muster. 

“This is Rodney Miller, I’m calling you on behalf of District 9 of the National Park Service. Based on your resume, we believe you may be a good fit for a position that needs to be filled. Would you be open to scheduling an in-person interview to discuss the job further?” 

Hardly able to contain my excitement, I scheduled an interview for a week later. 72 hours later, freshly freed from the hospital, I had the city bus drop me off at a local used car lot where I used what little savings I had to purchase a well-loved 2005 red Chevy pickup. I then returned to my run-down apartment for the last time to gather my earthly belongings. I then hopped into my truck and left South Dakota for good.

 

District 9 of the National Park Service covers the Pacific Northwest region of the country and consists of Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. Yet the regional headquarters for District 9 rests 437 miles to the south in the heart of San Francisco. And so I set my compass towards California, like the hopeful fools hungry for gold a century prior, I too headed west seeking adventure, and like them, I greedily bit off more than I could chew. 24 hours on the road is more than enough time for your brain to reintroduce you to every horrid memory you thought you had suppressed too deeply to ever be recovered. And by the time every terrible moment in my life had been arrested and forced to testify before the jury of my mind, I was less than an hour away from my destination. I pulled into a trucker's stop to freshen up before the interview, and donning my only button-down shirt that wasn’t covered by Hawaiian patterns that only a grandmother could gift a man my age, I cautiously worked my way through the traffic of downtown San Francisco and arrived 15 minutes early. 

Ranger Miller sat at his desk as I was ushered into his small office, a small man with the voice of a giant, his average build perfectly complemented his equally average face. He looked more like a bank teller than a park ranger. Yet his voice carried the strength and confidence of a drill sergeant. 

“Thank you for coming in, Nathan,” he said as our hands met in a single shake. “I’m glad we were able to meet in person.""

 “Thank you for this opportunity,” I replied as I sat down. 

“So, tell me, why do you want to work for the parks service?”

 I thought for a moment, “Well, I’ve always felt more at home in nature, and I figured it was time to take my love for the outdoors and turn it into a career.” 

Miller looked at me, nodding slowly as if urging me to continue, 

“And to be honest, I'm not very good around people, and the escaping people in the woods is sort of a dream come true.” I awkwardly finished. 

Miller chuckled and said, “Yeah, most guys say something like that. A good number of applications view this job as an escape, and I can’t blame them; we’re all running from something. Are you willing to work long, hard days?”

 “Yessir, that’s definitely not a problem.""

 “And are you able to put up with an uncomfortable working environment?” 

“If by that you mean the great outdoors, yes, that’s fine with me.”

 He smiled and said, “You seem like a good kid, Nathan, and you’re credentials are good. I’d like to offer you a position; currently, in District 9 there are a handful of openings, so do you have any preferences that could help us find a good fit for you?”

 I thought for a moment and answered, “If possible, I’d like a position where it’s likely I’ll be completely alone for extended periods of time.” 

Miller stared at me with a gaze I couldn’t quite place, his smile faded slightly, and when he spoke, it was with a serious tone that was a newcomer to the conversation:

 “I have one position like that, it’s based out of an isolated post on the northeast side of Mt. Rainer National Park, the bulk of the job would be clearing and maintaining trails that haven’t been touched by anyone other than rangers in decades. It’s as secluded as it gets, and I’ll be upfront with you, there’s been a lot of turnover for this position.”

 he paused as if to choose his words carefully, 

“mostly due to the isolation and difficult terrain, it’s not for everyone.” Sheepishly, he asked: “Does that sound like something you’d be interested in?”

 Without hesitation, I replied, “That’s exactly what I want, I’ll take it.”

 Miller stared at me, the same way a father would stare at his son heading off to war. Finally, he said, 

“Great! Welcome to the Parks Service, Ranger Diaz.” 

A single bead of sweat rolled down his forehead. 

“Let’s get the paperwork started. You’re eligible for a sign-on bonus, and due to the difficult terrain at you’re post, you also get hazard pay. After you sign, we’ll go grab your government-issued tent, uniform, and boots, so sign here to officially accept the position.” 

With the swipe of a pen, I sealed my fate. After locating Uncle Sam’s gift, Rodney Miller walked me to the door, turning to me, he said,

 “you are to report for onboarding at the ranger post, 16 miles southwest of the town of Roslyn two days from now, you’re immediate supervisor is Ranger Tim Ward, you report to him now, be sure to give yourself time to get familiar with the town of Roslyn and pick up any essentials you need.”

 His sweaty hand met mine in a final handshake, and looking into my eyes, he said, “I truly hope our paths cross again one day.”

Roslyn, Washington, rests nestled in the rugged Cascade mountains; its isolation is no less than a needle in a haystack. With just 950 permanent residents, trees outnumber souls 1000 to one in this quaint, yet secluded, little mountain town. It boasts a laundry mat with 10 washers and dryers, as well as 3 bars, which dominate the town’s economy. A small grocery store called ‘Foodmart’, and a single diner, the type where everyone knows everyone, and the waitress calls you honey. Lastly, there is the library, which guards books older than time itself, and a librarian who looks like she was there when they were written. 

Roslyn is no bustling metropolis, but the people like it that way; it’s quiet and calm, and it suits most folks just fine. I pulled into town the evening before my first day on the job. And right away, I headed to ‘Foodmart’. Here, I picked up the ‘essentials’: sandwich supplies, ramen noodles, and a can of Pringles. I planned to sleep in my truck outside the ranger post that night, as there was no hotel in Roslyn. My nightly accommodations limited what I was willing to buy on the virgin trip to ‘Foodmart’. Tossing a pack of spearmint gum and a stick of deodorant into my cart, I headed to the checkout counter, behind which sat a woman of considerable age, whose skin reminded me of raisins. Eyeing me, this fossil spoke to me through blackened teeth and peeling lips, 

“New to the area? Or just passing through?” 

“Here to stay, ma’am, I’m the new ranger at Post 1150”.

 A wild look appeared in her piercing stare, a combination akin to both lunatics and wild animals. 

“In that case, Sonny, you’ll need some beer.”

 I chuckled, “Is the job really that rough?” 

She smirked and muttered, “We need to get you some beer,” before screaming at the poor girl stocking the shelves: 

“Nancy! Make yourself useful and grab this boy a six-pack of the cheap stuff!” 

the pretty college aged Nancy rushed off to quickly appease her grandmother.

 “Oh no, I really don’t need any alcohol, I’m not much of a drinker,”

 I said as the memory of the overpowering smell of booze and my friend's blood flooded my mind. 

“Here you go,” Nancy nervously said as she placed the cans on the counter. 

“Really, I don’t need it,” I protested.

 “It’s on the house,” the raisin lady flatly said. 

“I can’t accept this.”

 “Listen, boy. I don’t know where you’re from, but around here if someone offers you a gift, you take it. Now take the beer.”

 The moment was so very uncomfortable, it made me remember why I hate people, and like a dog with its tail between its legs I quickly paid and left beer in hand. Maybe ‘Foodmart’ isn’t for me.

Ranger Tim Ward was a creature of habit; his daily routine was set in stone, and that was all by design. It was his sun-faded blue Jeep Wrangler that served as my alarm clock that morning. At approximately 5:59 AM, his loud vehicle pulled up next to my truck, tearing me from my cramped slumber. He was a mountain of a man, a perfect poster boy for US park rangers; his skin was heavily tanned from the sun, and a finely maintained beard blanketed his face. If Paul Bunyan had a younger brother, it certainly would be Ranger Ward. He knocked on the window of my truck, and seeing I was awake, he loudly said,

 “I’ll give you 10 minutes to get in uniform and meet me in my office.”

 At 6:11 AM, I was outside his office door, knocking. I entered slowly.

 “You’re a minute late, something to work on, Diaz, isn’t it?” 

“yessir, Nate Diaz.”

 “Welcome to Washington Diaz, take a seat.”

 I sat in the worn chair facing the desk. 

“Now, Diaz, this post is not exciting, nor glamorous. If you’re expecting to impress any tourist girls with that uniform, you’re sorely mistaken. You can count the number of living souls you’ll see in these hills on one hand.”

 I bravely responded, “I know, sir, that’s what I signed up for.” 

His stare was heavy upon me, “What are you running from, son? The Law?” 

“No, nothing like that, sir, just some painful memories.""

 “Well, hate to tell you this, but you can’t outrun those, especially not here; nevertheless, I’m glad you’re here. We run a skeleton crew here at Post 1150, and honestly, we’ve been short-staffed here for quite a while. All the new hires they keep sending our way haven’t lasted any more than 6 months, I have no reason to think it’ll be any different for you, but who knows? I could be wrong.” 

he shrugged, “but no matter how long you’re here, you answer to me, and I expect you follow my orders without question. Got it?”

 “Got it,” I answered, “but may I ask, why doesn’t anyone stick around?” 

Ward sighed a sigh that was far heavier than the question warranted, “well Diaz, for some they couldn’t handle the isolation, at times a man is more secluded in these woods than if he were on the moon, and it wears heavier on some than it does on others, and some couldn’t follow my orders, and it cost them. Hopefully you’ll be different.”

 I nodded nervously, “I hope so too.”

 After some more small talk, Ward began to give some more detail on the job.

 “Here at 1150, we have two main roles. First, we are an information relay point for the fire lookouts dotted across this side of the park. We pass fire and weather updates on to the proper channels; you won’t have to deal with this side of the job. It’s primarily the duty of my assistant and myself. Now the second duty is where you come in, trail maintenance. Three rangers are assigned to this work. Christine maintains the south-east region. I doubt you’ll ever meet her since you and Reggie cover the north-west region. Now, Reggie has been doing this job longer than me, nearly 30 years, he’s set to retire at the end of the year, and it will just be you in the north-west region, but in the meantime, Reg will be training you. He’s a good man, and you can learn a lot from him. Seven miles up the trail is a small cabin that will serve as home base for you and Reg. After we’re finished here, you’ll head up there and he will give you the specific rules and start showing you the ropes. I do, however, have some general rules for you: first, no sloppy uniforms. I don’t care if you’re not in the public eye; I expect you to look sharp, and if I catch you out of uniform, I’ll write you up, got it?”

 I nodded, 

“good, second, maintain proper radio etiquette, the primary way I or anyone else will communicate with you is through the radio, Reggie will teach you how to use it later on, but it’s not your personal cell phone, it’s for work purposes only” 

“yessir, I understand” I responded

 “ok, and lastly,” his tone shifted, becoming more serious, “the cabin door must remain locked until daybreak, and no matter what voices or sounds you hear do not open the door.” 

Confused, I protested, “Sir? What if someone needs help? Shouldn’t I help?”

 he stared at me, and his voice was slow and sober. “Nothing out there is worth opening the door for, now get your pack, you’re heading up trail.” Confused, I stood up to obey.

The four-hour hike to my new home was among some of the most enjoyable moments of my life, with each step down the trail, the pack upon my back became lighter and lighter. As the crisp mountain air filled my lungs, I smiled. I was happy, untouched rugged wilderness surrounded me, encasing me in miles and miles of ponderosa pine. I had never been this happy, this peaceful; all my worries and burdens melted as snow in the spring. And yet I didn’t feel alone, I felt watched, not in a bad way, but as though the forest itself had set its eye on me. As though I had been accepted into its family, and I had its full protection and security. It was a sense of being loved, as though I was one with this wilderness. I pressed on, my face still wearing a smile. A little before noon, I arrived at the cabin that was to be my home. On the porch stood a tall, thin older man, who met me with a warm wave and wide smile. His dark brown eyes were full of wisdom and kindness. Stepping off the porch, he walked over to greet me, 

“Welcome, son, glad to see you made it safely, Nathan, isn’t it?” 

I nodded warmly, “Yes, sir, but you can call me Nate.” 

He smiled as he answered, “Well, alright, Nate, no need for that ‘sir’ stuff here, it’s just you, me, and the bears here.” 

He chuckled softly at his own joke, “I’m Reggie Dosela, but most people call me Reg. I’ll be you’re bunkmate till the end of the year, and in the meantime, I’ll be showing you the ropes.""

“Good to meet you Reg. I can’t wait to learn everything you know.”

 I liked Reg; he had a grandfatherly nature, which I found very calming. 

“Come on in, Nate, let’s get you settled.” 

he turned and entered the cabin, beckoning me to follow. Eagerly I followed, but as my foot landed on the porch's first step, I paused. An uneasy sense flooded my mind. I was being watched, not in the general sense I had felt before, no, something specific had its eye on me. An overwhelming feeling of dread clouded my brain, and slowly I turned my head and faced the woods behind me. There was nothing, nothing but an endless maze of bark and leaves; thousands of trees stood before me, and together they formed a dense wall of unknown. So much to see, and yet there was nothing there. And with this nothingness came a quietness. The type of quietness that shouldn’t exist in the forest, not a chirping bird, not a cracking twig, not even the music of the wind in the trees. There was nothing. Who knows how long I stood there? Was it seconds, or was it days? I do not know. My eyes strained to find even the slightest movement in the sea of trees, yet my eyes didn’t detect even the shaking of a leaf. Something’s out there; there has to be something out there. I know what I felt, and I felt a gaze upon me. To this day, I don’t know if it was real, or a trick of the light, or just the wind moving among the branches, but at long last, my eyes noticed the smallest movement, thousands of trees away, there was a shape that didn’t belong. A dark mass slightly sticking out from behind a birch tree, no bigger than the corner of a man's shoulder, the foreign shape slowly shifted till it was fully gone behind the tree.  

“Nate? You ok?” The words from Reg broke my trance,

 “Um, yeah, sorry, I was just taking in the view.” 

Quickly, Reg’s eyes scanned the horizon, seeing nothing. He said, “Well, come on, once you’re unpacked, we can get lunch going.” 

Turning, I quickly crossed the porch to enter the cabin, and I tried to banish any fear over what I saw from my mind; it was easier than I thought, I told myself, “it’s just an animal, of course you saw something moving in the woods.” Any concern I had was drowned out by the smell of cheap hot dogs, which awoke a starving beast in my gut.

The cabin, though small, was comfortable and cozy. Consisting of two small bedrooms, a bathroom with a shower, and a large open room that served as a living room, library, and kitchen, the ancient structure was a time capsule for adventures long forgotten. Its walls were dotted with pictures of vistas rarely seen, specimens of both the animal and mineral kind, and well-used hiking equipment, all of which boasted a grand story of their own. The library was small yet well-rounded; the living room held an old reading chair paired with a small end table, and a weathered leather couch covered in a layer of dust. Large windows opened to the woods on both sides of the cabin. The kitchen hosted a retro fridge and stove, both from the 70s, and the cabinets were well stocked with canned beans and Spam. All in all, it was a charming place, a pleasant change from my crummy apartment back in Oacoma, and I quickly made myself at home.

As we ate our well-balanced lunch of hot dogs and baked beans, Reg began to supply more information on my new career. 

“You won’t need to worry so much about food around here. We have more than enough canned supplies to last the winter, and twice a month, weather permitting, they send porters up the trail to supply more perishable foods to our cabin and some of the watch towers further up. You’ll need to write down a list of any food allergies you have, so they can adjust their trips accordingly. They’re usually pretty good when it comes to getting us stuff we enjoy, only limitation is on the drink side; they only bring up bottled water and beer, so if you have a certain brand of beer you like, include it on the list.” 

I nodded and waited for him to continue, “when it comes to the job for the most part we maintain the trails that are a day’s journey from the cabin, yet once a month we deal with the longer trails, these are on a rotation so you only deal with each one twice a year. When the time comes to maintain these longer sections, what you’ll do is hike 2 days up and turn around, clearing the trail as you work your way back to the cabin.”

 He paused to inhale part of a hot dog. “This is where your pack comes in. Always have it ready for a three-day trek. Alongside our normal duties of trail maintenance from time to time, we serve as messengers to the nearest watchtower. If their radio goes out, it’s roughly three days out, so be ready to go that far.”

 “Absolutely, I’ll pack tonight.”

 he nodded, “good, other than that Nate, this is a fairly easy post, just always be aware of your surroundings, especially early on, some parts of these trails are pretty difficult to follow, so if you aren’t paying attention, you can end up off trail and not sure how to get back, practice common sense and take it seriously, follow Ward’s rules and you’ll be alright.” 

“What’s with Ward’s rule about helping people at night? Aren’t we supposed to help people?”  

He thought for a moment and slowly answered, “Well, son, a couple of years ago, there were some incidents. Now’s not the time to get into it, but basically, some calls for help after dark weren’t what they seemed, and opening the door only put rangers in harm's way. Since then, the standard operating procedure for this region is to keep the door closed and locked and radio in the disturbance. You must follow this rule, Nate, at the very least, your job depends on it.”  

 “Ok, I understand,” were the only words I had. 

 “Well, good, finally I got one last odd rule for you, though it’s more of a ranger tradition than a rule.” 

“Alright, what is it?”                                                                                                                                               “Whenever you’re more than a day’s hike away from the cabin, always pack a bottle of beer with you.”                                                                                                                                                      I stared at him with a confused look.

 “I know it’s strange, but it’s tradition. Older generations of rangers started it; the reasoning behind it was that if the ranger suffered a life-threatening injury, this deep in the woods, chances are it was the end of the line. Packing a beer allowed the ranger the option of a final drink as he lay dying in the woods.” 

“That’s pretty morbid,” I responded,        

 “yeah, it is, but it’s tradition. Every ranger packs a bottle in his trail pack; it’s our way of keeping in touch with our roots. And now that you’re one of us, you should do the same.”

I nodded, happy to be part of a timeless tradition, no matter how strange.  

“That’s all I got for you, rules-wise. I suggest you take the afternoon to pack your gear. According to the radar, we have some heavy rain for the next few days, so we’ll be cabin-bound. But on the first of next week, we’ll be heading up trail 5, which leads to a couple of watchtowers, and it’s due for maintenance. We’ll be covering roughly 40 miles in the four days we’re on the trail, so rest up over these few days.”

The radar was right, heavy rain filled our weekend. Water fell from the heavens onto the overhead cover of pine and gently dripped down, forming small pools in the dirt. These few cabin-bound days were calming and refreshing. The old reading chair became my home as I ingested various nature-themed books, washing it all down with a regular supply of hot tea. Saturday brought the heaviest of the rain, like a shower that wouldn’t turn off; it washed away any topsoil and reshaped the forest floor, carving microscopic canyons into the Washington soil. I sat reading Patterson’s field guide to animal tracks, and the large picture window to my left reminded me of a windshield in a car wash. The constant flow of water down the glass blurred everything to the point that only colors and rough shapes were perceivable. Yet out of the corner of my eye, there was movement, a crossing motion somewhere in the surrounding woods, which distracted my gaze from my book. I turned to the window, wondering if what, if anything, I had seen. I sat and watched the rain, and there it was again, a dark shape roughly 20 yards from the cabin weaved its way between the trees, working from left to right, with clear, intelligent movements, as stealthy as a snow leopard, it moved with purpose, like a ghost, it moved, vanishing behind every tree, and covering the distant between each one with masterful skill. Its shape was unclear; the water on the glass, matched with its movement, made it impossible to see any distinguishing characteristics. All that was known to me was its dark color and movement. I quickly stood and stared intently, hoping to identify the owner of the shape, but soon it was gone. It went behind a large tree, and I watched to see it cross on the other side, but it never did. It was gone. Reg, who was organizing the cabinets in the kitchen, noticed me staring, and he crossed over to stand with me at the window,  

 “Something caught your eye?” he said.                                                                                                             

“Yeah, not sure what though, can’t really tell right now with the rain, and I’m not sure where it went, it just went behind that tree.”                                                                                                                                     Reg’s eye’s quickly scanned the view from the window, seeing nothing he responded with 

“well probably just a deer looking for a dry spot” 

“that’s what I thought” I said “only it was a lot darker than a deer, and looked a bit bigger too” 

Reg nodded “hmm, I wouldn’t worry about it, lots of animals in the woods”

 with that he headed back to the kitchen though I noticed as he passed the front door he causally turned the deadbolt, locking the door. Something I was told to only do at night. He quickly changed the subject to reminding me what to pack for our upcoming journey. I listened, but couldn’t help but feel like he wasn’t telling me all he knew.

Sunday came and went, late Sunday evening, the rain broke, and the clouds cleared. Monday morning, I was met with the most amazing sunrise I had ever seen, as well as the warm smell of a fresh pot of coffee. Leaving my bedroom, I was met by a smiling Reg, who handed me a mug of joe. 

“Today’s the day, son, we hit the trail right after breakfast, a lot of ground to cover today, 15 miles give or take. We've got to make our camp area at the top of Scalpers Ridge before nightfall.”                                                                                                                                                      “I’m ready when you are,” I said with a grin. “I’ve been looking forward to this.” 

After breakfast, Reg grabbed two glass beer bottles. He put one in the side water bottle slot of my pack and the other in his. And then he reached for the old two-way radio that sat upon the kitchen counter near the coffee maker. Speaking into the receiver, he said, 

“This is Reg and Nate, we’re heading up Trail 5, will be out of contact for about four days.”

 Seconds later, the radio spoke back with the voice of Ranger Ward, 

“Thanks for the heads up, Reg. Stay safe out there.” 

“Will do,” said Reg, “over and out.” 

We then fastened our packs to our backs and headed up Trail 5. The route to Scalpers Ridge was long and difficult, and even more so after a strong rain. The once coarse and dry dirt had now been transformed into smooth and slippery mud, which made the uphill trail all the more time-consuming. Over the next 15 miles, we were to gain 2500 feet of elevation to our night’s stop on top of Scalper’s Ridge, and tomorrow we would lose the elevation as the trail descended to the meadow on the other side of the ridge. It was hard work but fulfilling; the wilderness was full of life and beauty after the storm. As noon approached, we had covered 10 miles, slowing down, Reg turned to me and in an exhausted voice said, 

“Let’s rest here for lunch, the last five miles are steep and rocky. We’re making good time, so let’s take a good long breather before the hard part.”

 I nodded as I released the pack from my back,                     

“You don’t have to tell me twice.”

In this moment, I welcomed food and rest as if they were old friends. We both sat down and located from our packs the ham sandwiches Reg had made yesterday. Turning a log into a bench, we sat and ate. No five-star restaurant could rival this dining experience. Our stopping point provided us with a vantage point over the land we had covered; it was truly glorious, miles of woods as old as time, untouched by human hands. Reg broke the silence, 

“Hard to believe some people want to tear all this down, and put in more roads and apartments.” 

“I’d like to think that if they would only come out here and see all this, they would have a change of heart. I think most people don’t realize this is all here, and if they did, they would want to protect it.” 

Reg chuckled quietly, chewed his sandwich, and thought for a moment,

 “The settlers saw the same land the Cherokee saw, only they didn’t see what was there; all they saw were fields for cattle, and timber for towns. Some people don’t see the beauty of nature, Nate; they only see resources to fuel their comfort.”

 I looked at Reg and saw a man time had forgotten. The modern world had no place for a man like him, and yet he was the kind of man this world needed, a man of wisdom, of tradition, a mentor. The allure of wealth and comfort did not affect him; he cared only for real things, for people, and the world people had forgotten. Our discussion shifted to debating whether the eagle or the falcon was the better predatory bird. And as it did, off in the distance, we noticed a traveler moving up the trail we had spent the morning conquering. 

The individual moved quickly, far quicker than Reg and me. When we first noticed that we weren’t alone on the trail, this new pilgrim was a few miles out, yet within the hour, they had approached our position. The hiker was a woman, probably in her early thirties; she was short, yet athletic. And she, like us, sported a large backpack and a Rangers uniform. She radiated the confidence of someone who had a great deal of experience in the outdoors. Reg acknowledged her with a nod and said, 

“Afternoon, Sarah, good to see you, heading up to your tower, are you?” 

Sarah responded, “Howdy, boys, good day for a hike. Yep, Reg, returning home, that time of the year.” 

“That it is, hopefully we won’t see many fires this year. We’ll be spending the night at the ridge. You’re welcome to join us; we’ll make the room.” 

Sarah shook her head, “Thanks, but I prefer the meadow, hoping to make it to the tower tomorrow afternoon, so I've got to pack in the miles today.”

 “Ok then, just be safe, don’t push it too hard.” 

She grinned, “Will do, see you around, fellas,”

 she said with a wave as she headed up the trail. After we had parted ways, Reg turned to me and said, 

“That was Sarah Henderson. She’s the lookout from tower 7, 12 miles past the ridge. Been doing the job for 10 years give or take, she’s one of the good ones, loves the job and takes it seriously.”

 “Well, it’s good to know she’s out there,” I said. 

“That it is, Nate, and if everything goes right, we probably won’t see her till the end of the season.” 

30 minutes later, after we finally agreed that the eagle was the better bird, Reg rose to his feet, and with a stretch, he said, 

“Well, we should probably get a move on; the last couple of miles are rough going, and we’ll want some time to settle at the ridge.”

 I agreed and reached for my pack.

I do not take any medication, although I am considering restarting metformin. I maintain a keto type diet and avoid processed sugars/carbs at all costs. 

Now the fun stuff. I’ve thought I was doing great and according to my bloodwork.. I am. With the CGM I discovered how caffeine has been spiking my glucose. My finger pricks also seemed to be within a healthy range, but I usually check while fasting or if I had a heavy meal that might have spiked me. Sneaky sneaky 😏.

To summarize, I have found that if I eat protein with healthy fats the spike from coffee immediately starts to drop. Aha moment 💡. I now no longer fast with coffee in the morning. Instead, I either add protein and mct oil or I eat a fiber bowl with eggs and cheese or bacon. Also, warm water is essential first thing in the morning. 

Here’s a comparison of doing what I thought was right versus informed eating with CGM. There are notes where I either tried to correct the spike with exercise(stair stepper 3 minutes) or water, protein/fat.",3,1770751469.0,diabetes,2,1.0,False

Ela é super simples e é basicamente no olhometro mas posso confirmar que tirei os dois melhores cafés que ja tomei aqui em casa:

Receita pra quem não quer ver o vídeo ou não fala ingles:

**Proporção** 

 1:16

 15g☕️ para 240mg💧

**Moagem**

Média/Grossa

Ref: iCoffee 20 a 22 clicks

**Agua**

91ºC

**Ataques**

Aqui que vem a magia, é tudo no olhometro sem considerar peso. O despejo deve ser feito o mais próximo possível do porta filtek para evitar agitar muito a cama.

1. Bloom de 30seg, só hidratar o grão

2. Despejo próximo do porta filtro, despeje até elevar 1,5 centímetros, espere a cama secar um pouco e repita o processo até chegar na quantidade da receita (240ml nesse caso)

**Minha experiência**

A primeira receita fiz com **20 clicks** na primeira vez e isso junto com os fines fez a agua demorar muito a abaixar, lá pelo quinto despejo achei que tinha estragado a receita e teria um café amargo com muita adstringência pois demorou **6 minutos (!!!)** pra fazer a receita. Minha surpresa veio quando saiu um café claro e com absolutamente todas as notas proeminentes (o cheiro de rapadura era muito claro) e doçura que o grão prometia entregar. Sinceramente uma das melhores xícaras que já tomei na vida. Acredito que isso se deu por dois fatores: **torra recente do grão e baixa quantidade de água.** Os despejos curtos e demorados extraíram o café muito bem e trouxeram o potencial total do grão.

Na segunda receita fiz com **22 clicks** pois o tempo de despejo me incomodou bastante. Essa receita foi no tempo esperado, **3 minutos e 20**. Curiosamente o café saiu mais escuro e forte, não sei o que aconteceu pois as outras variáveis foram controladas. As notas não estavam tão proeminentes mas estavam lá, o café saiu mais ácido e muito mais encorpado. Creio que para aqueles que gostam de acidez e ainda estão fazendo a transição de cafés gourmet para cafés especiais essa seja uma boa receita. Não sei se errei na receita em algum momento e o resultado na xícara se deu por conta disso, testarei de novo e volto aqui para falar.

**Considerações finais**

Minha única critica a essa receita é a demora e a quantidade de despejos, mas creio que esse seja o motivo pelo qual o criador do vídeo chamou de ""método zen"".

Gostaria da opinião do pessoal que já testou essa receita e aqueles que não testaram testem e venham aqui contar suas experiências!

Everyone looks insanely hot except you, right? I spent years convinced I was invisible. Turns out, I was just blind to my own appeal. After diving deep into psychology research, podcasts with dating coaches, and books on human attraction, I realized something wild: most of us are terrible at seeing ourselves accurately. We fixate on our flaws while others notice our strengths.

The psychological term is ""mere exposure effect,"" we see ourselves so often that we become hypercritical. Meanwhile, others experience us fresh every time. Science backs this up too. Studies show we rate ourselves 20% less attractive than others rate us. Your brain is literally sabotaging your self image.

Here are signs you're more attractive than your anxious brain wants you to believe:

**People remember random details you mentioned once**

When someone finds you attractive, their brain subconsciously prioritizes information about you. They'll bring up that obscure band you mentioned three weeks ago or ask about your sick cat. This isn't just good manners, it's neuroscience. Our brains allocate more processing power to people we're drawn to. If people remember tiny specifics about your life, you're occupying mental real estate.

I noticed this pattern constantly but dismissed it as coincidence. Nope. Attraction makes people pay attention.

**Strangers are weirdly helpful toward you**

Notice how people go slightly out of their way for you? Hold doors longer, offer unsolicited help, let you cut in line? There's actual research on this, attractive people receive more prosocial behavior from strangers. It's unfair but documented.

Dr. Jeremy Nicholson breaks this down brilliantly in ""The Attraction Doctor"" podcast. He explains how physical appeal triggers unconscious helpfulness. People want to be near attractive individuals, even briefly. If baristas give you extra shots or neighbors offer to carry your groceries unprompted, that's data.

**People get awkward or overly formal around you initially**

This one surprised me. I always thought awkwardness meant people disliked me. Wrong. When someone finds you attractive, they often become slightly nervous or overly polite at first. They're trying not to mess up the interaction.

[""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer](https://www.amazon.com/Like-Switch-Influence-Attract-Winning/dp/1476754489), former FBI agent, explains this perfectly. He spent decades reading human behavior for the Bureau. The book discusses how attraction creates subtle anxiety, people stand straighter, choose words carefully, laugh at your mediocre jokes. It's involuntary. This book will make you rethink every interaction you've had. Seriously good read for understanding social dynamics.

**You get complimented on specific features repeatedly**

Pay attention to patterns. If multiple people mention your smile, voice, or hands, believe them. We tend to dismiss compliments as politeness, but when different people notice the same thing? That's your signature feature.

There's fascinating research in evolutionary psychology about this. Certain traits signal genetic fitness and health. If people consistently compliment specific attributes, those features likely align with attraction markers. Stop brushing off compliments, your brain is filtering out accurate feedback.

**People mirror your body language unconsciously**

This is huge. Mirroring, copying someone's posture, gestures, or speech patterns, happens automatically when we're attracted to or interested in someone. Next time you're talking to someone, notice if they shift positions after you do, or pick up their drink right after you do.

I started tracking this after reading [""What Every BODY is Saying"" by Joe Navarro](https://www.amazon.com/What-Every-BODY-Saying-Speed-Reading/dp/0061438294), another ex FBI agent who's insanely good at reading nonverbal cues. The book is packed with practical techniques for decoding body language. It's genuinely eye opening and kind of makes you feel like you have superpowers.

If you want to go deeper on attraction psychology and communication patterns but prefer something more digestible than dense books, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is worth checking out. It's an AI-powered audio learning app built by a team from Columbia and Google that pulls from books like the ones mentioned above, dating coaches, relationship research, and expert insights to create personalized podcasts based on what you actually want to learn.

You can set a goal like ""become more confident and charismatic as an introvert"" and it'll build an adaptive learning plan just for you, pulling the best material from its knowledge base. You control the depth too, quick 10-minute summaries or 40-minute deep dives with examples. Plus you get a virtual coach named Freedia you can chat with anytime. The voice options are legitimately addictive, there's even a smoky, sarcastic style that makes learning way more engaging during commutes or workouts.

**People find excuses to extend conversations with you**

They ask follow up questions when the conversation naturally ends. They mention ""one more thing"" as you're leaving. They suggest grabbing coffee or checking out that thing you mentioned.

This isn't random friendliness. When we're attracted to someone, we subconsciously look for reasons to prolong interaction. The psychology podcast ""Where Should We Begin"" with Esther Perel dives into relationship dynamics and how humans signal interest. She's a couples therapist with decades of experience, and her insights into attraction patterns are brilliant.

**Your presence changes room energy**

People perk up when you enter. Conversations pause briefly. Others orient toward you physically. This sounds dramatic but it's observable if you pay attention.

Look, societal beauty standards and algorithms designed to make us feel inadequate have completely warped our self perception. We compare our behind the scenes to everyone's highlight reel. Your attractiveness isn't just physical anyway, it's energy, confidence, how you make others feel, presence.

The research is clear: you're almost certainly more appealing than you think. Our brains evolved to spot threats and flaws, not to accurately assess our own appeal. Start noticing these signs. Collect evidence that contradicts your inner critic.

Attractiveness isn't some fixed ranking, it's subjective, multifaceted, and way more about how you carry yourself than specific features. Stop waiting for permission to believe you're attractive. The data is already there.",0,1770751064.0,Datingat21st,0,0.5,False
1r1a533,https://www.reddit.com/r/coldbrew/comments/1r1a533/what_i_need_to_do_for_starting_a_cold_brew_coffee/,what I need to do for starting a cold brew coffee business?,"My friend and I try to start a cold brew business but my biggest concern is oxidation. We gonna use Baby Hardtank for brewing process because its easy fast and consistent. most important thing is; its clean(or we think it is). So we are looking options for bottling but not sure which method is good for us. 

We don't want to use pasteurization because we think it reduce the aroma. Also we don't wanna use potassium sorbate (which is legal to use in my area) for the same reason. 

We just wanna use coffee + water and believing the cold chain methods like styrofoam boxes. 

When we research how we do this properly and saw we actually use beer methods like sanitazing bottles with star san, transferring cold brew with vacuuming systems and kegs and nitrogen.Also use a bit nitrogen for tip of the bottle, brown(beer) bottles and crown caps for minimizing the light effect on coffees and sending them with styrofoam boxes for keeping cold chain. Any idea or suggestions for this method. In details this method provides us a minimized oxidation and last longer than traditional way. But we don't know how much. Maybe it's last long 1 month or more but it's possible this method is not gonna work and we fail with just five or six days of last long. I wonder what you think about that and waiting for your comments or messages. I guarantee that we are not rivals in this business because of my location :)

🥪 Farrow Sandwiches - 124 St  
📍 6-10240 124 St, Edmonton, AB  
  
Farrow Sandwiches have been heavily recommended online and by Edmonton locals. It has multiple locations and now I can tell you why.  
  
Farrow is a very casual sandwich shop that delivers in flavour and quality. They serve the finest sandwiches, coffee, baked goods and they even cater.  
  
I got the Truffle Shuffle ($14.5) and a Boston Cream Cronut ($4.75). The truffle shuffle consisted of sliced chorizo, truffle mayo, American cheese, candied jalapeños, tomatoes and green. And holy gods was it good. I will always hate on American cheese, but I could have substituted it. The sandwich, as a whole, was amazing and messy. Do not eat in your car. Savour it in the sandwich shop. The flavours of everything come out in this sandwich, making it perfect.  
  
The cronut was soft, delicious and filled with custard. I was OBSESSED. Messy as well but worth it. Not to mention, their baked goods are house made!  
  
I understand why this place was so highly recommended. It was filling, delicious, reasonably priced, fresh, and made with high quality ingredients. I highly recommend this sandwich shop.

from The Beatles Diary Vol 2 After the Breakup 1970-2000

  
Sunday September 28 (1980)

 The tenth and final day of Playboy interviews takes place this morning during breakfast at La Fortuna’s coffee shop.

Playboy: “Do you still take LSD?”

John: “Not in years. A little mushroom or peyote is not beyond my scope, you know, maybe twice a year or something.”

In total, John and Sheff have recorded over thirty hours of fascinating interview material. **Following the session with Playboy, John has another haircut and, along with Yoko, boards a plane for Los Angeles where they have arranged to meet George and Derek Taylor at Monty Python’s concert at the Hollywood Bowl. George gives John a copy, on audio cassette, of his latest album. Following the show,** George remains in LA while John and Yoko return to New York, arriving back in the early hours of September 29.

1r19zkl,https://i.redd.it/dx9bqyrrupig1.jpeg,Tried some of the decants in my bucket list,"I ordered some of the decants from my bucket list.

Most of them met and performed above my expectations. 

Got my order very fast and smooth , thanks to [u/svk43](https://www.reddit.com/u/svk43/s/syHDNhH6jx) . Packaging is very good and no compromise in terms of quality of the juices. The complimentary decant he scent caught me off-guard, such an ethereal aroma.

In this post, I'll try to give the initial reviews of the perfumes from this collection.

These are my own experiencs and no where I'm a professional in this domain. Just a normal man's thoughts. 

1. ***Jpg paradise garden***:

(Opening like center fruit mixed with wildstone edge perfume (aquatic note), once settled down fully, fruity mixed with mild coconut aroma , later you will feel little incense , overall you'll get a whiff of it in the air once in a while. Enjoyed a lot throughout the day.  Mild and non-headache scent. The aroma you feel in the air and the aroma you get when you smell close to the spot you sprayed are little different. projection is moderate 6 to 7 hrs and comrs closer to the skin later).

2. ***Valentino uomo born in roma Intense:***

A sweet scent , versatile one. Opening I observed is bit funny , smelt like a syringe drawing out the medicine from the vial.

Overall liked it. Dry down is salty sweet. Might be feminine for some people.It has that candy sweetness. 

3. ***Hugo Boss Bottled Triumph Elixir:***

Opening feels like a bitter woody fragrance. Almost feels like neem leaves khada smell. Dry down is woody.

4***. Nude Coral Diamond Ibrahim Al Qurashi***

: This one is easily among my top 3 of the mentioned decants.

I received it as a complimentary decant. Aroma is ethereal. Well blended fragrance. I felt a mix of saffron,vanilla,coffee,caramel and bit chocolaty in the opening.  Dry down turns dreamy with creamy coconut and lavender... I would wear it for any cold evening/night events. Projection is good.

5. ***Boss Bottled Absolu:*** Honey and cough syrup opening. I could feel the leathery Insence in the opening as mentioned in fragnatica as top notes. Drydown brings woodiness and further sweetness.  A mature scent which can be applied in any cold weather and night events.

6. ***Givenchy Gentleman Reserve Privée*** : woody opening...Earthy and nutty dry down. Kind of sophisticated sillage, but somehow feels fresh. 

7. ***JPG Le Male Elixir***: Opening is sweet and has roasted nutty smell . Scent profile switches very quickly but sweetness remains the same. Later in the dry down feels like honey and lavender and a little bit of a menthol, finally shows some saunf elements. A party wear fragrance. 

8***.Ck One Gold***: A very nice opening , kind of citrous and bubblegummy mixed with candy note. Fragrance fades away faster with the remains of woody and candy sweetness.

9.Ck all: Starts with a nail polish smell. Drys down with a Dettol sanitizer smell. Has that citrous and white flowers.

10.Ck One: Same opening as Ck all. More on white flowers side. Has leafy white floral scent profile. Comes closer to the skin with floral sweetness. 

11.Ck be: Has same opening as above two Cks with added whitner smell. But onec it starts to settle,  it shines with a good blend of lavender, mint leaves and white florals.

12.Xerjoff naxos: Opening is boozy saffron. Dry downis a sophisticated honey and Jasmine smell. Very seductive. Has tobacco spiciness in the background. 

13.Dior homme Intense: Woody opening.

Has a roasted nut smell in the background with a hint of earthiness. I also got almond sweetness in the dry down. Again a night wear for me.

14.D&G the one edp: Mild citrous and woody opening for me. I've sensed the cardamom and tobacco spiciness in the background. Lingers in the air very well. A cold night scent. 

15.Armani Stronger with you Intensely: A fruit salad and apple juice opening. Very peachy. Really well blended. I felt some kind of musk melon scent in the air. It's a fruity cinnamon sweet scent profile. Best suited for winters and night events. ",2,1770750637.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,1,1.0,False

1r19wci,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThisAintAdderall/comments/1r19wci/my_experience_4_months_taking_adderall/,My experience 4 months taking adderall,"*(For context I have been diagnosed with Mild inattentive ADHD)*

So first I started off with 10mg of Adderall XR to test the waters back in November. Shit was alright to be honest, it felt manageable but didn’t feel much of an effect on my concentration or motivation. If anything they came in waves, last 10 mins, then nothing for like an hour or so. First 2 weeks my hunger and appetite was suppressed but after that I was able to binge eat even after an hour of taking them. Eventually it got to a point where I didn’t even feel jack shit. Not even the bad side effects and it felt like I was either taking a sugar pill or placebos. (I also had this IRRESISTIBLE craving for watermelon???? Did anyone else get this while taking them or is it just me? 💀)

Now second dose? That’s when shit got me good. My doctor upgraded to 20mg and I recommended going on IR since I didn’t see the point of having the meds last 12 hours of the day. First 2 weeks I experienced pure euphoria and felt like a Greek God. I got everything done the 3-4 hours it was active and only needed to take 1 pill of the day, only 2 if the workload demands it. Even when the euphoria faded I felt like I still had the capability to stay motivated and get through it. Side effects were pretty small as well with the exception of extreme thirst, constipation, and fatigue

 —The crash, although terrible, was manageable once I discovered Jasmine tea mixed with a cinnamon stick and some added milk can SMOOTHEN the come down by a fucking lot (I highly recommend this compared to coffee, energy drinks, or even high protein/grain food when it’s leaving your system and you want a chill evening.)

My third refill? Which is the one I’m on atm? Holy hell this thing is a massive downgrade. Headaches, sweats, diarrhea, and even body aches. All costs, no rewards. So far I’m unable to even concentrate as it feels like I’m not even taking any stimulants at all, if anything it feels like I’m taking a bottle of magnesium and shitting out grains. Got my bidet pleading for help.

And this brings me to the point of my post:

The manufacturer I’m on is SANDOZ. My previous ones are Elite and Alvogen. 

Both elite and sandoz had me reading the print on the bottle with one ingredient on bold: Amphetamine.

And at first I didn’t think much of it because I chalked it up to being some kind of error.

But Alvogen? The print read BOTH: Dextro-amphetamine and Amphetamine. 

I don’t know if I’m reading too much into it, but I think the doses I have for this month and the one I first started adderall with HAVE to be lacking the ingredient dex. There just ain’t no way. Now I do plan on talking with my doctor about this and see where we can go from here. So far I know there are some positive experiences with Teva but I think they’re controversial due to their origin. I also MIGHT request going on Dexedrine since I read that the only active ingredient is dexamphetamine?

Any thoughts or recs?

1r19urk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1r19urk/am_i_righr_this_f_collegue_destroyed_our/,Am i righr? This F collegue destroyed our friendshio,"I'm a 46-year-old man. For two years, I worked with a 50-year-old woman colleague who was four years older than me. We are both married and have two children of the same age. We got along very well. We were talking, going to lunch together or with other colleagues. She also brought me home-cooked food, because she knew I liked to eat well. Sometimes she would offer me cakes and snacks, a bit like a big sister I found. Sometimes she had childish behaviors with me, for example one day she ran up to me to talk to me, like a child, and then she teased me during a discussion. Whenever a meal was organized at work for a party, she insisted that I attend, because I don't like meetings between colleagues. Then it became colder and more distant. Sometimes she would come and ask me to go out at lunchtime with her to do some shopping. She often offered outings with the children, but I systematically refused, because I didn't want to see a colleague outside of work.

Then I had problems with management, a kind of harassment that I experienced very badly. For several months, I didn't talk to anyone at work, focusing on my tasks and trying to get through this difficult time. The colleague tried to find out why I was isolating myself, and simply said, ""I have a lot of work to do,"" without further explanation. One day, I ran into her on the subway, and she came to see me, offering to travel together. She had a behavior that I would describe as flirting (she would get very close to me, stick her chest against my arm, lean very close to talk to me). One day, she even walked into my office to look at something on my screen and stuck very close to me. I didn't know how to react because she's older, and I was quite surprised.

I then found another job in another office, and my departure was announced. This colleague then came to see me, congratulated me on my last day and told me that she was inviting him to lunch that day. On D-Day, she invited me and asked me if she had done something wrong, why I didn't talk to her anymore. I explained to him that I had been harassed and that I had been looking for another job, which I had found. She warmly congratulated me, praising the fact that I was ""comfortable in my job,"" ""drole"" etc. She was relieved that my distant attitude did not come from her. She then continued to engage in flirting gestures, such as touching my hand furtially with her index finger while she ate.

I then told him that, since I was leaving for another office, we could stay in touch and see each other for family outings with children and spouses (perhaps this was a mistake on my part!). Ravie seemed very excited when I contacted her offering her an outing with the children, but I noticed that she did not warn her husband when we met. That's why I then proposed family outings with the spouses. She accepted and organized several outings during the summer, and we met regularly. With our respective spouses. I thought our relationship was great. Except that sometimes, when I went out with my kids and didn't warn her, she would point out to me, ""You didn't call me, it's not nice."" Yet she did it on her side, but frankly, I didn't care. She offered small dishes and snacks, prepared pic-nics. He always seemed very motivated. She also began to criticize her husband, saying that he doesn't invest himself, that he just stays drinking coffee at home, that he is old. When I asked her about the context of their meeting, she told me that he was the one who flirted with her and that she was not interested at first, because he was unemployed at the time. Anyway, it wasn't love at first sight. She also asked me to download series from her and put them on a USB stick, something her husband could have done. When her husband was present, his behavior changed. She became silent, distant, not talking as usual. We felt that she was away from him. On the contrary, he seemed very much in love.

She promised to show me a recipe. I had proposed that she come home with her family, that we all cook together, and then eat the meal in groups. But one day after an outing with her son and my son, without the spouses exceptionally, she said, ""We'll meet at your house for the recipe. Okay, when I got home, I thought we were going to talk over coffee or tea, but she refused. She started cooking by herself, washing dishes, without saying anything. Very weird. Then she says ""the meal is ready, I have to go now"" and then she left without even talking. It was really, in my opinion, a strange scene.

She had planned to travel to Spain with her family and I told her that I knew this country well and that I preferred Portugal. She then decided to go to Portugal with her family.

She started by organizing outings with both families herself, booked hotels, offered hikes. Barbecues and home meals. She even wanted our two families to go out with the children, like at the pool, etc. She even wanted to go together to a foreign country, and to a cottage in the mountains. She also offered to organize a women's outing between her and my mother at a spa. Then, after a dozen intense outings and several invitations to dinner at each other's house, she stopped giving news. All of a sudden. She used to call to suggest outings on the spot, etc. One day her husband was supposed to help me set up a piece of furniture, which had been planned for weeks, and on D-Day, he made me look bad. She intervened to force him to keep his promise, and when I came to pick him up by car, he told me in the car during the ride ""if she wants us to part, no problem."" I didn't understand this intervention.

Then, no more news... I wrote to her several times to find out if everything was okay, and she answered me briefly. I then sent my New Year's greetings to her husband, unanswered. She promised to give me contacts from renovation companies, which she never did.

I then confronted her by text message several months later, without news... I asked her why we disappeared and why she didn't give me the promised information about the renovations. She wrote to me that she was on vacation. I wrote to him: ""You two disappeared without giving us the promised contacts, you are profiteers."" Then called twice, but I didn't answer. She then said something like, ""A true friend would have tried to find out why someone is distancing themselves,"" and then concluded, ""This is where our relationship ends.""",1,1770750354.0,FriendshipAdvice,3,1.0,False

I’ve heard a few options around town, but wanted to see what the actually best to go with. People keep recommending L’atelier Tiramisu, apparently they do online orders and have multiple flavours, but original still reigns supreme. Da Paolo supposedly does party trays, which seems handy for me since  I want a slightly bigger share. Some folks swear by TinyKitchenBakes on Instagram for small, custom cakes. Cat and the Fiddle has also come up a few times, though I’ve never tried their tiramisu myself. A workmate even mentioned Facebook Marketplace as a surprising place to find home bakers doing quality tiramisu cakes locally. I even considered checking Alibaba for bulk options, mostly out of curiosity and affordability. So, any personal favs here?

When we first got together I’d say we engaged in sexual activity as regularly as the average couple did. Not too much and not too little. Over time though it has dwindled to basically nothing. Months go by without her ever even showing the slightest interest in sexual activity.

Several years ago I realized I was experiencing some mental difficulties. Mostly a lot of stress at home that led to some unhealthy drinking behavior. Before things got out of hand I decided to focus on getting my head on straight. So for the last three years I’ve been completely sober and taking care of myself physically and mentally. I’m talking the whole nine yards; no drinking, no drugs, gym 6 days a week, therapy every week, taking anti-depressants, focusing on hobbies, etc. I’ve been doing literally everything in my power to be a better and happier person.

The only problem though is that despite all my efforts to make my life better and hers that we never have sex or do anything remotely sexual. And over the years I’ve realized something. It’s one thing to not fuck and it’s a whole other thing to not fuck and not have any other outlets that scratch that itch.

Part of this self improvement was cutting back on masturbating. I know that doesn’t exactly help this specific situation, but on top of the fact that I felt like I was bearing off too much, I also started to get really depressed while looking at pornography and engaging in the act entirely. So, I’m not like a no-fap guy for idealistic reasons, I just cut back to one every few weeks just because it doesn’t make me happy.

That’s basically all I wanted to vent about. Used to be I could deal with the loneliness by having a few beers, but that’s no longer a solution. Living an extremely healthy and regimented life might be good in some ways, but there’s just something wholly unsatisfying about not having a vice that makes life kind of dull. Try as I might, I don’t get the same rush or satisfaction from sweets or coffee the way a drunken fuck does.

And no, I have no interest in leaving. We have a great marriage despite the lack of sexual activity. She’s got her own stuff going on and I can’t exactly force her to want to have sex nor would I. And it’s not like I do all this self improvement just for sex, but like it would just be a nice bonus. Physical stuff aside, I miss the intimacy and I miss feeling desirable. I wish more than anything my wife just ever got horny. Actually, the irony here is that she dos get horny sometimes, but primarily only after she’s been drinking, and at this point I’ve completely lost interest in having sex with someone who’s only interested in it after she’s had her nightly bottle of wine while I’m completely sober.

Working out, hobbies, pets, friends, cleaning, and all the other things you can do to distract yourself in a sober and sexless lifestyle really hasn’t translated for me yet to being an adequate substitution. More than anything I was really hoping my the SSRI’s would kill my sex drive. You can imagine my disappointment when they didn’t. I’m just hoping like hell that one day I’ll finally just stop caring or thinking about it so it can stop being a problem for my happiness and mental health.",8,1770749914.0,DeadBedrooms,6,0.83,False

Sure, you can tip, or you can try to contact the store manager, but I'm talking about something built into the system, like in the app or the website.

  
At one of the two new Starbucks in Tuscaloosa, the partner who took my order, a short coffee in my personal cup, did not take my cup but instead went around the counter and grabbed a paper cup. This has been happening less and less (almost never in the fifty stores I've wisited in a week and a half), and in the few cases that it has, the barista has acceded to my (always polite) request that they not waste paper.

  
This barista, however, ignored me, instead replying ""oh don't worry, I'll pour it into your cup"", which of course betrays a lack of understanding that customers who bring in personal cups might feel strongly about not wasting resources, as I do.

  
HOWEVER, just at that moment a different barista came up to the counter, and I quickly asked them to quickly swap out the paper cup for my personal one before the Vertica started pouring. Now, over the past 5-6 years, since I started using a personal cup (with much personal guilt over all the paper I wasted), I have asked baristas to swap out the cup dozens of times, if not over a hundred, and when it comes to the Vertica, not a SINGLE barista has EVER moved quickly to grant my request.



Until today.



This barista reacted like a ninja, quickly grabbing my personal cup and swapping it out before the pour began, and then, without my asking, returned the paper cup to the stack.



That was EXACTLY what I wanted, and what I needed as a customer, and this barista was attuned to that, which is the mark of excellent customer serωice. If I could grab my app and give them a wirtual award (hopefully translating to a good score when review time comes around, a raise, promotion, etc.), I would do so in a heartbeat.

1r19jxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r19jxj/situtionship/,situ@tionship?,"I'm struggling with a personal situation.

I happened to meet a guy a few months ago, and what I experienced with him I've never experienced with anyone.

I'm talking about simple things like: everyday experiences, going out, ""dates,"" evenings, nights out, depth of thought, dinners, coffee, chemistry, affinity, anxiety and not knowing how to behave, text messages and jokes, feeling what he tells me as if I'd already experienced it myself, the fear of being vulnerable, sides of myself I didn't know, anger at not being able to tell him certain things, frustration when we're far away and emotionally different, and everything that someone's presence and absence can make you feel.

And on the one hand, this thing scares me a lot because I don't know where it's going.

It all came naturally, spontaneously.

There were also times when we weren't close (and I'm not talking about physical contact), there were also

times when he hurt me deeply.

When I met him, it was a bit of a strange time for me: I had recently changed jobs, I was preparing for university exams, and my intimate and emotional situation wasn't rosy.

In short, meeting him was like something that was meant to happen (I believe this because of how we met), and now, after a good few months of this situation between me and him—a more intimate situation, though still deep, with openly discussed emotional understanding, compared to the one we started with, which was a simple and basic friendship/acquaintance—I can't decide whether we're together or not.

We haven't said anything, but I'm starting to think the need for clarification might be approaching.

Maybe I'm kind of expecting him to tell me/ask me, even though I'm perfectly inclined to do so myself.

Maybe I'm a little afraid of rejection, preferring the idea of ​​enjoying myself day by day.

Maybe I'm a little worried he doesn't really like me.

And then maybe it's also the idea of ​​his long-time ex holding me back, and not so much because of retroactive jealousy as because of her ability and way of making him feel at least as loved as she did.

Maybe partly because he told me early on in our relationship, before we even had that kind of contact, that he didn't want to commit and wasn't looking for anything.

(Something I questioned when it seemed like our relationship was going somewhere completely different.)

I'm not sure I've ever loved anyone or that I truly know how to love in that strict sense. I feel love for my friends, sure, for my family, and for the space I can express myself in, but ""that love""? What does it mean?

Is what I'm feeling really love?

And because of my proud and shy sides, I have so many things to say or do that I can't always express them or get them across to the other person.

Sometimes we didn't speak for days, and then everything went back to normal. Sometimes he'd look at me with those big dark eyes of his and somehow tell me something.

As the title says, I had my first major anxiety attack this morning. Maybe it’s not as major but to me it felt like it. 

I’m currently tasked with giving a presentation at work next week. I have always had anxiety over public speaking. I could be an expert on the topic and it still wrecks me. Yesterday afternoon, I was starting to practice in front of my wife and I immediately felt a rush over my body, heavy sweating, and nervousness. It slowed down but never really went away the rest of the night. I have also struggled with insomnia since I was a child and of course last night when I closed my eyes, this came to my mind and it took me a while to fall asleep.

This morning, I woke up around 6:45 am. Before I got out of bed, I thought I felt pretty rested but when I got out of bed and went downstairs for my coffee I knew immediately I didn’t feel like myself. I had a full body rush again, internal trembling (nothing visible if I put my hand out), massive headache, and nausea. I couldn’t finish my coffee and I forced a banana down so I can take my BP meds. My heart didn’t seem to be racing but I checked my BP and it showed 153/92. I laid down for a few and checked it again about 10 minutes later. This time it was 158/98. 

My wife forced me to go to urgent care and they explained a lot and prescribed me Buspirone for the next 10 days. This should get me through my meeting and presentation next week. 

What can I do to help get me through next week? Deep breathing doesn’t seem to help. I started therapy back in October but I do not think that it is helping. I don’t mind taking medication if I have to but I’m already on meds for my BP and insomnia.

I'm plant-based and eat a ton of tempeh, beans, and tofu, but I've always been fairly thin with a fast metabolism.

Lately, I've been finishing my hardest runs (speed and strength runs, not long runs) somewhat shaky and cold, often with some mental fog, and I'm feeling pretty worried about overdoing it effort-wise and underfueling. I think my primary issue is fuel and blood sugar. 

Part of my issue is that I'm on a budget and playing around with Gu/store-bought gel alternatives. First I played around with [this Maurten copycat](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1gfug7o/so_you_wanna_make_a_gel_an_update/) you might remember, which worked great but my passion for it has faded (too technical, I love maurten but not that much I guess). Now I'm trying [this simple 1:1 Maltodextrin & Fructose gel](https://www.tracerfitness.com/blog/make-your-own-energy-gels), but am not convinced it's for me. Today, I didn't have anything prepared so I just did maple syrup because I had some in the fridge.

The biggest challenge with these is dosing—I use a reusable flask, and though I've often held a full serving in my mouth to memorize how 1.2 oz (or whatever the given serving size is) feels in my mouth, I'm not sure I'm getting it quite right.

I run in the morning, I only fuel with a gel beforehand (no solid food), sometimes have a coffee or tea before as well, and unless my run is over 10 miles I don't bring any fluids with me. For weekend long runs I might have some solid food like toast/peanut butter and a banana beforehand. After my runs I have an LMNT in 32 oz of water over the course of an hour, plus some sugars (whatever is on hand, today I had a rice krispie treat left over from the superbowl). Within an hour I have a meal.  I also supplement with 5g of creatine a day, beet juice, and chelated magnesium. 

So—to prevent this from just being a thinking-out-loud moment, here are my main issues:

* How do you dose bulk homemade gel accurately when using a reusable flask? 
* What are your favorite simple homemade gels? 
* Do you see any glaring issues in what I'm describing?

I’ve been in Vine since December ’22. Hit Gold after my first eval and stayed there ever since. In all that time I’ve maybe landed three items over $100. The biggest was a ride-on car for my kid that said $300 ETV but felt more like $150 in spirit.

Meanwhile I open this sub and it’s just screenshot after screenshot of Dyson vacuums, TVs, mystery $800 gadgets, and other “blink and it’s gone” items. It feels like some of you are playing a completely different version of Vine than I am.

So seriously… how?

Are you running scripts? Refreshing like day traders watching crypto? Working jobs that allow Vine monitoring as a primary responsibility? I always read that you have to be lightning fast to grab the big stuff, and I can’t even catch a decent coffee mug half the time.

For context, I mostly check Vine at night when I have downtime. I order maybe 2 to 3 items a week now. My yearly taxable total has never broken 3k. I still hit my 160 items to keep Gold, but I’m starting to wonder if Gold is just a shiny badge that says “congratulations, here are more phone cases and auto parts for cars you don't own.”

I’m not mad people get big items. Honestly, I think it’s awesome. I just feel like I’ve been in this long enough that I should at least understand the game mechanics, and clearly I’m missing a tutorial level somewhere.

Is it luck? Timing? Strategy? Vine wizardry? Teach me your ways.",22,1770749228.0,AmazonVine,58,0.87,False

It’s my first ever job and I don’t have any prior experience. (Not sure if this counts as coffee shop industry related, but it’s similar. Let me know if I’m in the wrong sub.)

After getting off shift I just started crying because I felt so incompetent. Even though logically I know this is my first ever job and obviously mistakes are bound to be made.

For my first shift, I was taught 3 recipes of the toppings. Not the recipes for drinks, just the toppings. I was following the steps okay but then I started to get confused mid-way through the first recipe. I’m someone who learns very slowly and I require more time to process new information. But before I could understand how to make the first topping recipe we’re already moving on to the next one.

Second thing I was taught was how to wash a commercial tea container. I was shown how to do this only once in the first hour of my shift. I was tasked by the SM and show them how to wash it in the last hour (after my brain has been stuffed to the brim with a lot of information) I stared messing it up.

The SM who’s teaching me is not mean or rude, just strict and have certain expectations of me. Which is expected. And working at a boba tea shop is a fast-paced environment which I also expected.

Everything was just so overwhelming and I wasn’t able to keep up. Before I could even process how one thing works we’re already moving on to the next one. And I was expected to understand everything with just showing me once. When I was tasked to repeat some of the recipes I was just taught, I was already mixing the steps up. It doesn’t help that I also have slow movements.

I was told to memorise the recipes and was expected to be able to do all of them on my own in my next shift, which is in 3 days. (Which is probably the bare minimum and I feel incompetent that I’m struggling with this.)

I have this feeling, even before I started my first shift here, that I’m not suited to work in any kinds of kitchen. But I just don’t know if I’m judging too early or I’m just really not suited to work in one.

I’m also thinking of already quitting. But I’d feel bad to do so because it was my roommate who recommended me for this job and if I quit I feel like I’ve wasted it. But also if I feel that I’m not suited to work here I should tell the SM, no? So I wouldn’t make them waste even more time on training me just for me to mess everything up.

On top of that, I also have social anxiety and I’m already dreading having to manage the cashier position. There are also underlying mental health problems that are affecting how I work, though I’m not diagnosed with anything or know what it is, just some speculations. I just know something is wrong with me.

I’m just not sure what to do, I feel like a wimp for wanting to quit this early when I barely even started. If I’m already struggling with basics tasks, how am I supposed to keep up with more complicated ones?",3,1770749095.0,barista,7,0.71,False

1r197p6,https://i.redd.it/ixs6a66xppig1.jpeg,Day 3 tongue piercing,"Okay so I got this Sunday afternoon. Only time it really hurts is to talk but not that bad. Kinda uncomfortable to find a spot for it in my mouth sometimes but other times I totally forget about it. I’m super nervous about infection tho, with all my piercing but especially this one. I wash my mouth a lot. Everytime I eat, finish a drink or through out a zonic( low mg nicotine pouches) which I did ask my piercer about. I also wash it when I wake up, go to bed and a couple times throughout the day just to be safe. I brush my teeth like normal but I can never get all of the drink or toothpaste or mouthwash completely off of my tongue. I try my best to brush it and through out the day I’ve been using paper town to get the left over drink or saliva build up off my tongue. I haven’t drank any alcohol or ate any solid food. But my tongue still looks like this. Am I doing something wrong or if this normal? Sorry for the long post, I’m just trying to be cautious.

Also my tongue wasn’t brown this morning, I had an iced coffee from Starbucks and I did wash my mouth with alcohol free mouth wash after and wiped around piercing with paper towel. But I woke up with tiny bit of blood around it this morning but was able to get rid of it and it hasn’t come back

Don't know if he likes me or hates me like me (f26) how do I handle this or let him know I like him?,"TL;DR: A guy from my college class shows a lot of interest in person (initiates hangouts, pays for tea, hugs, remembers details, opens up emotionally) but barely texts and sometimes goes days without responding. I’m confused whether he likes me but is avoidant/unsure, or if he just enjoys the connection without wanting a relationship.

I met a guy in his late 20s in one of my college classes. He asked for my number early on, and over a few weeks we started spending time together. Most of our hangouts were framed as studying, but often turned into long conversations.

Early on, he initiated multiple meetups, paid for tea or coffee, walked me to my car, hugged me a few times, invited me to play pickleball, and opened up about his mental health, medications, family, and career goals. He remembered details about me and my family and asked indirect but specific questions about relationships, like honesty, fidelity, and who leads in a relationship. He also invited me into everyday things like running errands together.

One night we spent almost two hours talking over tea. It felt very comfortable and date-like even though it was never labeled as a date. He later invited me to his house to continue studying because the WiFi was better. His parents were home and nothing inappropriate happened.

After that night, his behavior shifted. His texting became very sparse, and he stopped responding to a message where I thanked him for tea and asked a simple follow-up question. He went three days without responding, even though we still saw each other in class.

In class, he still acts warm. He sits near me, initiates conversation, remembers details from past conversations, jokes, and lightly teases. But outside of class, he does not follow up, call, or text the way he did before.

Some context: he is very structured, cautious, and conflict-avoidant. He is not verbally expressive and rarely gives compliments. He seems much more comfortable in person than over text. I showed interest early on but stopped chasing once the silence started.

What confuses me is that his in-person behavior shows interest and comfort, while his lack of follow-through outside of class feels like emotional withdrawal.

From a your perspective, how would you interpret this behavior, and what would you recommend doing next?",3,1770748921.0,relationship_advice,18,1.0,False

I did not get selected so there may be some gaps in my knowledge/this information reflects my experience in February 2026.

*  The jury managers were incredibly nice and did a great job communicating on what we needed to do when, what to expect, timelines (at least as far as they were aware), etc. after we arrived/each day we were there
* Parking was only reimbursable at one garage (Fulton Street Parking Garage). They would hand out parking validation once a day for that garage
   * Parking was busiest Monday and Tuesday so it paid to get there a bit early from what    we were told
   * Even if the lot said “full” there are spots reserved for jurors - these spots were only reserved until about 9AM (start time on Monday was 8 AM and 9 AM on Tuesday)
*  The jury room itself was this huge room with comfortable chairs, electric outlets distributed randomly on the floor, a kitchenette, nearby bathrooms, TVs and free coffee – I highly recommend bringing a book, laptop or some other distraction as there was *a lot* of waiting
* Lunch was roughly an hour and a half
* Dress code was somewhat relaxed. A good number of folks were in jeans/button ups and sneakers. More on the “casual” side of business casual
* Bailiffs (around 7 of them) communicated to the jury managers on the need for jurors and the jury managers would announce who was selected to be interviewed. This did not happen all at once due to last minute negotiations between the lawyers, etc. for the total of 4 cases scheduled for the week. The names selected were chosen at random according to the jury managers.
* We got let go early on the 1^(st) day (around 4-ish) and were released before lunch on the second day. This does not always happen according to the jury managers
* We received a letter at the end of our service to document the days we served.

  Elder emo that enjoys all types of music and will still mosh when the occasion calls for it. I’m used to having to drive hours one way for shows so I’m VERY excited for concerts around PGH, already have several lined up. (Taking Back Sunday tour announcement dropped as I was typing this, who's going?)  

  Big sports fan. Already got season tickets to the Riverhounds and going to a Pens game \[that I may have a spare ticket for\] after the Olympic break. Football/F1/NASCAR Sunday is my favorite day of the week.  

  Child free by choice but I don’t mind kiddos and mom friends! Personally I’m the ‘fur baby’ type.  

  I like the standard dinner-and-drinks but would prefer active hang outs like hiking/walking, bowling, book club, taking classes together, hosting game nights (once we’re settled in), things like that.
