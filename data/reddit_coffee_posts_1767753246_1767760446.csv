I’m having a recent dilemma with my family. It’s a super long story. To explain the situation i have to give some basic context, so buckle yo ass up. 

My sister got married to a guy. Let’s call her T and him M. He seemed nice. All is fine. They get married and all is good. A few months after the wedding I get a notification on my phone that says “Your phone contact Luke created a new kik app profile”. See the thing is i don’t know anyone named Luke. I clicked on the profile and it turned out to be M and he had created a fake profile. Sus. I made a fake profile of a random local girl and wanted to find out what his sneaky little ass was doing. Long story short he said lots of incriminating this. I brought the evidence to T after a wee of messaging. I had arranged a meet up and M was planning to meet this fake local girl at a coffee shop (he also told this girl he likes to fuck on the first date). Always, she blows of up phone before we can catch him in the act of meeting this girl at the coffee shop. But long story short he denies everything and she believes it. Also i call bull on that. 

Fast forward a few years and a few kids later. It’s obviously kind of awkward being around him and we don’t talk at family event so basically try to avoid each other. He’s basically also turned into more of a loser of the years and managed to turn into an alcoholic, lose his job, threaten to report my other family member for fraud, and almost put T into near finically ruin after filing for bankruptcy. He then later had mental break, drove to another state with a gun and was gone for like a week without any word. My sister felt abandoned and filed for divorce after this. Last was last year. 

Fast forward to present day. He is still coming to family holidays and events. Year after year. My husband hates him. He’s doesn’t really talk to anyone. M and T just bicker at each other the whole time. And he’s just in general really weird. 

They also sold their house together this winter yay right? Nope…. They bought another together. Ya, fucking weird.  

It’s so fucked up. So getting to the point of this story. This year i messaged her and asked if her exhusband was going to yet again be coming to Christmas. I told her i was not comfortable being him for obvious reasons. She got mad. Said i was selfish and only think about myself and don’t care about her family. She also still blames the messaging i incident on me and that i catfished him. Like yes bitch, i did catfish him and caught its stupid ass. But it’s not my fault that he did what he did. 

AITA for not wanting him around? I told my mom that me and my husband can start coming to holidays earlier and leave before they get there. It’s sounds petty but it’s been 6 years of walking around on egg shells around him. ",1,1767760213.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

**T+03:21:00 (Pulse 134)**  
*Venus Orbiter Operations, Night Shift Room with Dim Lights*

Night shift rooms always felt like the inside of a submarine: dim light, muted voices, and the quiet arrogance of humans thinking they could keep watch over planets with coffee and screens.

The monitors cast a soft blue glow across the faces of the two operators on duty. Everything else was shadow: empty chairs, coiled headset cords, a vending machine humming like a bored insect. The air smelled faintly of warm plastic and stale caffeine.

On the main display, VESPER hung in its orbit around Venus like a patient lantern, a machine with a job and no opinions about it. Its instruments watched the planet in ultraviolet and infrared, and listened to the ionosphere the way a physician listened to a chest, hunting for murmurs that meant trouble.

Rina Torres had been trained to treat the Sun like weather. Space weather was still weather: probabilities, indices, timing windows. You learned the patterns, you learned the hazards, you learned to stay humble.

But the alert that slid onto her console didn’t feel like weather.

It felt like a verdict trying to wear a forecast’s clothing.

SOLAR EVENT PROBABILITY RISING  
UNUSUAL GLOBAL OSCILLATION DETECTED  
POSSIBLE EXTREME FLARE/CME NEAR-TERM

Rina’s face went warm, that quick flush of adrenaline that always arrived half a second before the rational brain caught up. She clicked open the packet, scanning the words again, as if they might soften into something routine if she stared hard enough.

Unusual global oscillation.

As if the Sun had decided to start tapping its foot.

She pulled up Venus’ induced magnetotail data. Normally, it was a living mess, exactly the kind of mess she trusted: the solar wind slamming into Venus’ upper atmosphere, draping magnetic field lines around the planet, flexing and snapping and reforming. Venus didn’t have Earth’s strong internal magnetic shield. It had a borrowed one, an induced one, a temporary umbrella made out of a constant argument between plasma and field.

Tonight the argument looked… constrained.

The magnetotail was tightening, not in a gradual drift but in a patterned squeeze, like someone was cinching a drawstring at regular intervals. Compression, release. Compression, release. The same signature appearing in multiple channels.

Rina leaned forward until her eyes were too close to the plot.

“That’s not-” she started, then stopped because finishing the sentence felt like making a claim the universe would punish.

Her console beeped.

A small, polite sound. A system notice.

But the timing of it made her skin go cold.

She glanced at the timestamp. Then at the previous marker.

Ninety seconds.

A pulse.

The magnetotail tightened. The ionosphere response spiked. Particle counts fluttered upward like a startled flock.

Ninety seconds later, it happened again.

Rina’s mind tried the standard list, the comfortable inventory of reasons:

Instrument cycle. Telemetry cadence. Data packet batching.

She checked the metadata. The sampling rates were not ninety seconds. The packet timing wasn’t synchronized that way. Different instruments, different clocks, and yet the planet was responding as if it had been taught a rhythm.

A third pulse arrived, right on schedule.

Rina’s throat went dry. She turned to her teammate, a man with tired eyes and a posture that suggested he’d been awake for years.

“You seeing this?” she asked.

He rolled his chair closer, leaned in, and stared at the overlay without speaking for a long moment. In the dim light, his face looked older than it probably was.

Finally he said, “That’s… rhythmic.”

Rina felt the word land in her chest like a weight.

Rhythmic meant driven.

Driven meant agency, or at least forcing. It meant something upstream wasn’t simply flaring and relaxing the way solar wind normally did. It meant something had introduced a clean periodicity into a system that lived on chaos.

She toggled the ultraviolet nightside feed. Venus’ faint airglow should have been a quiet smear, soft and constant.

Instead the emission was beginning to lift in synchronized flickers, as if the atmosphere itself was being tapped with a steady finger. Not an aurora yet. Not a storm yet.

A tremor.

A warning tremor.

Rina’s mind reached for something to say that wasn’t fear.

“It’s like…” She stopped. She didn’t want to say heartbeat. That word belonged to living things. The Sun was not supposed to have one you could set a watch by.

Another beep.

Pulse 134.

Venus’ induced shield tightened again, and Rina imagined the solar wind arriving not as a gusty river but as a set of measured waves, one after another, with a precision the Sun did not naturally possess.

Somewhere far away, eight minutes of light-time away, the star was doing something no star was supposed to do.

And here, wrapped in dim light and cheap coffee, Venus was answering the rhythm like a drumskin.

Rina swallowed and keyed her mic.

“Log this as coherent periodic compression,” she said, forcing her voice into the calm tone that made emergencies feel manageable. “Cross-check particle flux channels. If this escalates into a CME impact profile, I want timing on the first-arrival radiation front versus bulk plasma.”

Her teammate nodded slowly, but his eyes never left the plot.

Because the scariest part wasn’t that something might hit Venus.

The scariest part was that the universe had started keeping time.

And Venus, the planet that couldn’t protect itself the way Earth could, was already being squeezed to the beat.

**T+03:33:08 (Pulse 142, plus a breath)**

It starts, as it always starts now, with a screenshot that doesn’t know it’s a match.

A cropped plot, black background, neon lines. A power spectrum with one obscene spike highlighted in a shaky red circle. The caption is too casual for the thing it contains.

“Solar folks: am I losing it or is the Sun doing a 90s metronome rn???”

It gets twelve likes in the first minute. Three of them are from people who shouldn’t be awake.

---

**T+03:34:21**

A reply appears from an account with a university logo in the bio and the kind of optimism that gets people tenure or ulcers.

“Probably instrument cadence / windowing artifact. Don’t panic.”

Underneath it, someone posts a second screenshot.

Different instrument. Different color scheme. Same spike.

No caption. Just the image, like evidence slid across a table.

---

**T+03:35:50 (Pulse 144 − 10 seconds)**

A space weather hobbyist with a radio tower in their profile photo posts:

“HF absorption just did a weird periodic squeeze. Anyone else seeing ~90 sec?”

It’s not a popular account, but it’s the kind of account that other obsessives watch like hawks. Replies come in from different time zones, from basements and garages and backyards where antennas point at the sky like question marks.

“YES.”  
“Thought it was my setup.”  
“Not my setup.”

Someone adds: “This is global.”

The word global lands like a stone.

---

**T+03:37:02 (Pulse 142)**

A short video hits the feed, ripped from a screen recording, shaky enough to feel illicit. It’s a scrolling dataset with a faint periodic pattern, and a voice off-camera whispers as if the universe can hear.

“It’s… it’s every ninety seconds. It’s like it’s breathing.”

The video ends with a hard cut, the kind that happens when someone realizes they’re recording something they’re not supposed to record.

The comments are immediate.

“Fake.”  
“ARG?”  
“This is from a real dashboard, I’ve seen that UI.”  
“Why is nobody talking about this??”

Someone is talking about it. Everyone is, now.

---

**T+03:38:10**

A meme account gets there second, which means it gets there loud.

A picture of a metronome. Under it, a picture of the Sun. The caption:

THE SUN: “1… 2… 3… 4…”

It gets more engagement in two minutes than the original plot got in five.

That’s how it spreads: not as a warning, but as entertainment. The brain’s way of touching a hot stove with a glove.

---

**T+03:39:44 (Pulse 146 + 44 seconds)**

A livestream starts, titled with a question that is trying to disguise itself as clickbait.

“IS THE SUN… SYNCING?”

The host is a mid-tier science communicator with a calm voice and a ring light. You can see the fear in the way they keep smiling.

They hold up the same plot. Then another. Then a third.

They say “likely instrumentation” three times in four minutes, each time less convincing, each time sounding like someone reading the safety card while the plane is already shaking.

The viewer count climbs anyway.

---

**T+03:41:05**

A leaked audio clip appears. Twelve seconds long. No context. Just voices on a conference line, compressed and grainy, but unmistakably adult.

“…our current best description is: the Sun is syncing.”

Silence. A dry cough. Then, faintly, someone mutters:

“Maybe it’s aliens.”

The clip cuts off.

The internet does what it always does with a forbidden sentence: it repeats it until it becomes real.

---

**T+03:42:30 (Pulse 148 + 30 seconds)**

A hashtag is born, not because it’s clever, but because it’s simple.

#SunSync

It begins trending in pockets, then spills. People post their own interpretations like offerings.

“This is definitely a military test.”  
“This is definitely a solar cycle thing.”  
“This is definitely the end times.”  
“This is definitely fake.”

Everyone is certain. Certainty is cheaper than fear.

---

**T+03:44:07**

A journalist at a reputable outlet posts the most dangerous sentence in modern society:

“Hearing chatter from multiple observatories about an unusual solar oscillation. Trying to confirm.”

That sentence makes it legal, in the public mind, to be afraid.

A flood of replies demands answers the journalist cannot give.

“Is it dangerous?”  
“Is this why my GPS glitched?”  
“Is this related to the aurora last week?”  
“Aliens???”

The journalist replies with caution.

“No evidence of immediate danger. Still verifying.”

The public reads: they don’t want to tell us.

*DKIST Control Room, Haleakalā Observatory*

By three and a half hours in, the control room had the atmosphere of a courthouse right before a verdict. Not loud. Not dramatic. Just a dense quiet threaded with the small sounds of people trying not to make mistakes while history watched.

On the wall, the Sun no longer looked like weather.

It looked like a structure under load.

The corona, normally a lacework of looped fury and tangled brilliance, had been combed into a symmetry that made Mara’s skin crawl. The loops were still there, still arcing and folding and glowing, but the messiness had been reduced into a small set of preferred curvatures, as if the field had been forced into a cleaner topology. Too many arcs shared the same radius. Too many footpoints aligned. Too many features held still when they should have jittered.

Order can be stability.

Order can also be tension.

Mara kept the EUV channels stacked beside the magnetograms and the Doppler maps, watching the same region from three angles of truth. In the helioseismic overlays the ninety-second mode kept landing like a hammer strike: disk-wide, phase-stable, refusing to broaden or wander. In the line-of-sight velocity maps, the photosphere “breathed” in a coherent global oscillation, a subtle in-and-out that ought to have been shredded by convection and differential rotation but wasn’t.

The phase stayed locked.

That was the obscene part. Not the amplitude. The fidelity.

Jun stood close enough that Mara could hear his breath catch every time the next pulse approached, as if his body had started anticipating the universe like it was a metronome in the next room.

“It’s compressing complexity,” he said, and it wasn’t a metaphor. He was looking at the helicity proxies, the braided twist of the magnetic field, collapsing.

Mara followed his gaze. The twist metrics were trending down with a stubborn monotony, like a system being driven toward a low-entropy configuration it hadn’t chosen. In normal corona evolution, stress accumulates in tangles: shear, twist, braided currents. It looks like messy hair because it is messy hair. Energy storage in the field lives in that mess.

But here the mess was being organized.

“Like combing,” Mara murmured, more to keep her voice steady than because she liked the comparison.

Jun made a sound that wasn’t quite a laugh. “Yeah,” he said. “Until the comb hits a knot.”

Pulse 151 arrived.

And the knot announced itself.

It didn’t start as a flare. Not a bloom, not a flash. It started as a failure of geometry.

On the EUV feed a long, thin structure near the limb began to deform in a way Mara had seen in smaller events a thousand times: a filament channel, a dark ribbon of cooler, denser plasma suspended in a magnetic trough, losing equilibrium. The spine of it bowed upward, subtle at first, then with accelerating inevitability. Its anchoring points held… and then didn’t, not by snapping like a rope, but by slipping, as if the field lines were being made to reconfigure faster than the plasma could follow.

A kink-mode signature bloomed in real time: the filament writhed, twisting around itself, the classic helical deformation of a current-carrying flux rope that has been pushed past stability. At the same time, the surrounding coronal loops began to lean toward it, not randomly, but in coordinated motion, as if the entire magnetic arcade had been tuned into the same mechanical response.

“Pre-eruptive rise,” someone said behind her, voice too tight. “It’s lifting.”

Mara’s fingers hovered over the keyboard, still not touching, as if contact might make it more real. Her eyes flicked to the magnetogram-derived field extrapolations: the modeled connectivity was changing. Footpoint mapping shifted. The magnetic skeleton of the region was reorganizing into fewer, cleaner connections, the way a stressed truss might redistribute load right before a buckle.

Then came the first true sign of imminent failure: a brightening that wasn’t a flare, but a seam.

Along a narrow line beneath the rising filament, a linear EUV enhancement ignited. Not a dot. Not a patch. A line, too straight, too fast, tracing the onset of a current sheet forming where the field was being stretched and thinned. It looked less like weather and more like fracture mechanics, a crack tip appearing in a stressed material.

Mara’s stomach went cold.

“That’s a reconnection front,” Jun whispered, and the word front carried all the wrong implications. Fronts propagate. Fronts spread.

The bright line lengthened. The filament rose faster. Adjacent loops snapped into new shapes with an ugly smoothness, as if the corona had been waiting for permission to change configuration and had finally received it. In the Doppler maps, flows along the filament channel surged. In the irradiance proxies, the region’s output began to climb, not as a sudden spike, but as the ramp of a system stepping from stable to metastable to gone.

The warning tone began, triggered by threshold algorithms that didn’t care about narrative.

It didn’t stop.

Exposure shutters adjusted. Gain dropped. The image hunted for balance and failed to find it because the underlying scene was no longer balancing anything. It was transitioning.

Mara watched the filament’s spine cross a point that made her throat tighten: the rise was no longer being resisted. The structure had left its equilibrium basin. The field had lost the ability to hold it down.

This wasn’t the flare yet.

This was the pre-flare structural failure: a coronal flux rope breaking containment, the magnetic cage deforming under a driver that didn’t drift, didn’t jitter, didn’t hesitate.

A system tightened too neatly.

A system about to release.

Somewhere behind her, someone said, “It’s going,” in the flat voice of a person watching a bridge begin to fold.

Mara didn’t answer. Her brain was trying to drag the event into familiar categories: filament eruption, tether-cutting reconnection, torus instability, runaway. The physics was all there, all textbook.

What wasn’t textbook was the timing.

Pulse 151. Right on schedule.

She heard herself exhale, thin and involuntary, and then she said, very softly, because saying it louder wouldn’t make it less true:

“Oh no.”

---

**T+03:47:30**

An amateur astronomer posts a photo of the Sun through proper solar filters, with a long disclaimer about safety, and then the honest truth:

“You won’t SEE it. You’ll see it in the numbers.”

That line gets quoted and requoted, because it’s the first thing that feels like a map.

The numbers are becoming the monster. The numbers, normally tame, are now telling a story no one rehearsed.

---

**T+03:49:30 (Pulse 153)**

A university PR account tries to douse the fire with a cup of water.

“We are aware of reports of unusual solar data. Please rely on official sources. Do not share unverified information.”

The replies are merciless.

“Then VERIFY it.”  
“What are you hiding?”  
“Official sources are always last.”

The PR account posts again, slower, as if typing through wet cement.

“Solar observations are complex. Anomalies can result from instrumentation.”

The public hears: This is real.

---

**T+03:50:30 (Pulse 147)**

The first credible thread appears, the kind written by someone who knows enough to be dangerous but also knows enough to be careful.

A solar physicist, anonymous avatar, posts:

“This is not a solar cycle signature. This is not one instrument. We’re seeing phase coherence across multiple datasets. Still investigating. Please don’t stare at the Sun. Please don’t panic.”

The thread goes viral anyway.

Not because it says “panic.”

Because it implies that panic is a reasonable consideration.

**T+03:52:00 (Pulse 148)**

The metronome memes get darker.

A metronome overlaid on a clip of a ticking clock. The Sun behind it. The caption:

“WHEN THE STAR STARTS COUNTING”

People laugh and share it and then, quietly, check the sky as if the Sun might look back.

**T+03:51:40 to T+03:52:20 (Between Pulse 154 to 155)**  
*SWPC, Boulder*

The first sign that the day was getting away from them didn’t come from the Sun.

It came from a phone.

“DeShawn,” Liz said, and there was a tone in her voice that belonged to accidents. Not the kind you cleaned up with an email, the kind you cleaned up with lawyers. She held her screen out like it might bite.

On it: a grainy twelve-second clip, reposted thousands of times, tagged with #SunSync and a dozen uglier variations. The audio was unmistakable, even compressed and chopped. Adult voices. A conference line. That one sentence, clean as a razor.

“…our current best description is: the Sun is syncing.”

Then the little laugh, the muttered word everyone wished hadn’t been captured:

“Maybe it’s aliens.”

The clip ended. The internet had already done what it always did: looped it, captioned it, remixed it, set it to a metronome sound, turned it into a punchline so it wouldn’t have to become fear.

DeShawn felt the room’s attention shift, the way a flock turns when one bird sees the hawk. A dozen heads leaned in. Someone said, “That was our call.”

“Jesus,” someone else whispered, and not as prayer.

DeShawn didn’t touch the phone. He didn’t need to. He could already hear the chain reaction: PR calls, congressional staffers, a thousand inboxes filling with demands that started with Is this true? and ended with What aren’t you telling us?

“Okay,” he said, voice calm in the way a tourniquet is calm. “We keep the language conservative. We say ‘anomalous oscillation’ and ‘ongoing investigation.’ We do not speculate. We do not-”

A shrill, polite alarm cut him off.

Not a phone notification. Not an email chime.

A system alarm.

On the big screen, a plot that had been moving like weather suddenly behaved like a guillotine.

X-ray flux climbed so fast it stopped being a curve and became a vertical line.

For half a second the room froze, brains trying to reconcile the leak with the new reality, trying to decide which emergency deserved the first breath.

Then chairs scraped back. Someone swore loud. Another person stood so abruptly their headset cord snapped tight.

DeShawn’s coffee tipped and spilled, unnoticed.

“X-ray spike!” someone called, as if volume could turn it into less.

DeShawn’s eyes moved the way training demanded: not to the biggest screen, but to the confirmation chain.

GOES X-ray: pegging upward.

EUV feed: blooming into saturation, protection flags tripping.

Proton monitors: beginning their first nervous climb, the early wake-up before the storm.

Magnetograms: a sudden twitch, field lines reorganizing faster than they had any right to.

For eight minutes, the public would still be staring at an ordinary Sun. For eight minutes, the world would be arguing in comment sections while the radiation front raced outward at light speed, already unstoppable.

But here, in Boulder, the numbers had already screamed.

On a separate display, coronagraph data lagged behind by processing time, the way everything lagged behind by physics. The Sun’s limb brightened, then tore in a way that made even seasoned forecasters inhale sharply.

Not a small, localized eruption.

A structured release.

A massive coronal expulsion beginning to lift off with an eerie coherence, like a shell forming, like a fist unclenching.

“That’s not a normal CME,” Liz said, and her voice had lost its PR concern entirely. This was the older fear, the one that lived in people who had watched space weather eat satellites.

DeShawn heard Jun’s metaphor from earlier relayed through the day’s chain of conversations, as if it had become a shared myth.

The comb hits the knot.

“No,” DeShawn said, and he hated how steady he sounded. “That’s the knot.”

The room became a storm of voices and keystrokes.

“Run propagation!”  
“Direction, direction, direction!”  
“Any SEP signatures yet?”  
“Radio blackout risk?”  
“Get coronagraph confirmation!”  
“Do we have STEREO angle?”  
“Where is it pointed?”

And because the leak had just lit the public on fire, the next question came fast, sharpened by dread:

“What do we say?”

DeShawn didn’t answer that yet. Words were not the priority. Physics didn’t wait for messaging.

He snapped to the comms panel and stabbed a button. “I want the Sun monitoring station on a dedicated line. Now. Patch them in or open parallel. I need their eyes and their coronagraphs, full resolution.”

A tech’s fingers flew. Somewhere, a phone started ringing into a room that hadn’t heard the alarm tones yet.

A senior scientist, pale under the fluorescents, spoke like someone reciting a checklist to keep panic from becoming contagious. “Bulk CME travel time is hours. Minimum. But the radiation front is already on its way. That’s… effectively immediate.”

DeShawn looked at the wall clock and then, reflexively, at the live solar feed that was already eight minutes old. The cruelest part of this work was always the same: the universe moved at light speed, and human comprehension moved in conference calls.

On the still-open conference line, Elias Venn’s voice came through, quiet enough that DeShawn had to lean toward the speaker.

“That’s the purge,” Elias said, and this time the word didn’t sound like theory.

It sounded like a step in a procedure.

No one laughed. Not because humor had died, but because humor required the comfort of thinking you were in control.

And in that moment, with a viral leak on the internet and a star-sized event unfolding eight minutes ahead of their eyes, control felt like the oldest lie in the room.

I've been working on a social app called TWIBS that helps people get together with friends. I would love some testers to provide honest feedback and constructive criticism.

The basic idea is to make it easier to let your friends know about casual hangs, e.g. “Anyone want to do the Elysian Park trail on Sunday morning?” by dropping on a pin on the map, without having to spam group chats and text everyone you know. You can type that exact query into the AI Chat, and it will automatically look up the address for the trail and select the best 3D icon for the activity (in this case, a hiking signpost). 

You can also post a flyer or paste a link to an event, and the data will be automatically fetched from the image or URL so you can easily see which friends are going to upcoming shows near you.

Part of the motivation for creating an app like this was to make it easier for people to connect IRL. Life in post-Covid world can be very isolating, and my hope is that an app like this can make it fun to plan stuff and generally lower the bar for getting together in-person. I’ve found it especially useful for automatically pinging friends who frequent the same gyms/coffee shops by having them add those spots to their favorites so that we can easily let each other know when we go to those places. We’ve  also been using it as a quick and simple alternative to Partiful for things like small group dinners.

I'm looking for any kind of feedback, but especially curious about what specific use cases come to mind for you as a tester. Is this an app you would actually use? Why or why not? What can we do to make it better? 

TWIBS is completely free to use, but I’m including an invite code so that I can keep track of how people found it. Totally optional, but if you wouldn't mind, please use code TESTMYAPP during sign up.

Thank you!

1q65h8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/betatests/comments/1q65h8x/i_made_an_applooking_for_testers/,i made an app...looking for testers!,"Hi everyone!

I've been working on a social app called TWIBS that helps people get together with friends. I would love some testers to provide honest feedback and constructive criticism.

The basic idea is to make it easier to let your friends know about casual hangs, e.g. “Anyone want to do the Elysian Park trail on Sunday morning?” by dropping on a pin on the map, without having to spam group chats and text everyone you know. You can type that exact query into the AI Chat, and it will automatically look up the address for the trail and select the best 3D icon for the activity (in this case, a hiking signpost). 

You can also post a flyer or paste a link to an event, and the data will be automatically fetched from the image or URL so you can easily see which friends are going to upcoming shows near you.

Part of the motivation for creating an app like this was to make it easier for people to connect IRL. Life in post-Covid world can be very isolating, and my hope is that an app like this can make it fun to plan stuff and generally lower the bar for getting together in-person. I’ve found it especially useful for automatically pinging friends who frequent the same gyms/coffee shops by having them add those spots to their favorites so that we can easily let each other know when we go to those places. We’ve  also been using it as a quick and simple alternative to Partiful for things like small group dinners.

I'm looking for any kind of feedback, but especially curious about what specific use cases come to mind for you as a tester. Is this an app you would actually use? Why or why not? What can we do to make it better? 

TWIBS is completely free to use, but I’m including an invite code so that I can keep track of how people found it. Totally optional, but if you wouldn't mind, please use code TESTMYAPP during sign up.

Thank you!

1q65eyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q65eyw/aitah_for_not_doing_the_dishes/,AITAH for not doing the dishes?,"For context, I’m (28) a stay at home mom, and my husband (28) works full time. We have almost always been in a relationship where one person works, and the other person doesn’t, due to us living either in the US (where I’m from but my husband isn’t) or abroad (and every-time we’ve lived abroad he has worked and I’ve been a stay at home mom). We met in college and lived with each other since our senior year of college.

We moved to a new country in May of this past year. My husband works a lot. The work days aren’t really long (usually about 5-6h), but he works 6 days a week with very little holidays. And we have a three year old autistic son that does not go to daycare or school, so I take care of him full time.

Recently, (a couple of minutes ago lol) we finally got into a small argument that has been building slowly over the past month. 

Since we first began living together, we have had an agreement that whoever cooks, doesn’t do the dishes. It’s pretty straightforward, and it’s been like that without issue for years. Of course this doesn’t count when you are cooking for yourself, or if we cook just for our son. Then you both cook and do the dishes. 

About a month ago, I’ve noticed but not really cared too much that my husband would slowly ask me to start doing the dishes after I cooked for the three of us. Sometimes it was, “I’ll do these, can you do these” and sometimes he would say that he’s tired from work, and would ask me to do all of them. I’d always say okay, and it would annoy me just a bit because, well I did just stand there for an hour and cook for all of us and we have always had our agreement in place, but I know that he’s the one working and making the money, so I say yes and do it.

Just a bit ago, I finished making lunch, and the three of us sat together and ate. He got finished first, took his plates to the kitchen, and started to clean his dishes. I finished, brought my stuff to the kitchen while he was cleaning, then went and got our son’s plate and put it next to the sink as well. I go sit in the living room, and a couple minutes later her comes and says that he left our son’s plate and a few other items to clean. I asked why, and I said that he can just clean everything at once, so I don’t have to get up and do the dishes as well. He tells me that it’s only a couple little dishes, and that he has to work later and doesn’t see why I have a problem with it. 

Now, I’m incredibly stubborn, and I know that I have an issue where once I decide that I’m right, I’m unconditionally right. He’s the exact same way and it’s something we are constantly working on, but it does lead to a lot of minor arguments that we usually either brush under the rug, or collectively decide that we just don’t feel like being mad at each other over. There’s rarely apologies, so it’s an issue on both ends.

But I really don’t feel like I’m just being stubborn in this matter. We have had an agreement, and he’s slowly trying to put all of the dinner work on me, because he says that he’s the one working six days a week.

I brought up the fact that this has always been the agreement. When I worked, came home and cooked, he cleaned the dishes. When I worked, and he had cooked, I did the dishes. Any other time he worked and I cooked, he did the dishes. In our 7 years of living together, it has always been this way.

So I told him no. I said that I cooked, and you need to clean. He again brought up the fact that he’s working and I’m not, he acted like I was crazy for even questioning it, and when I brought up all the examples of times where I’ve worked and still kept up this agreement, he brought up the fact that he does the dishes when he cooks breakfast for himself and our son in the morning and doesn’t complain. 

I’m like, uh yeah, duh. I don’t eat breakfast. I drink a cup of coffee, so he’s only cooking for himself and our son. He says that it’s not just himself he’s cooking for though, and I respond saying that I shouldn’t have to clean just because you cooked for our son as well. 

He tells me that I’m overreacting, that I’m making no sense, and then on top of that. He goes upstairs without finishing the dishes.

With hands delicately turning the knob to the nursery door, Elise held her breath. There was an absence of sound as the latch slid into place. She had successfully managed to retreat after feeding her daughter. Her hand released from the smooth brass. The brunette stepped backwards through the threshold. The expression on her face was one of immense relief, though her eyes remained tired. The new parent tired. “Crisis adverted,” she mouthed to herself. It was much too easy to be absentminded and shut the door too abruptly and undo a near hours worth of work settling the young g child. 

Lis paused for a beat as if to offer a plea to the door itself. A few hours of rest is the reprieve she craved after three nights of a sick, understandably clingy baby. While it was an honor to be the comfort and safety for such a small being, the lines of where her body began and its utility ended were somewhat crossed. It wasn’t the first time this occurred over the past few months of settling into their new roles in life as parents. 

Aware that the difficulty would wax and  wane, as if had before, Elise returned to the rhythm and routine she coveted on these early mornings alone. She retreated from the nursery door with short shuffles of sock clad feet. Her hands grazed over opposite shoulders to soothe herself and warm her palms. Swiftly, she made a quiet breakfast of oats and fruit with various seeds and supplements atop. And she retired to the soft, very obviously lived in loveseat in the corner of their living room that over looked a large window. Elise settled in. Slowly, mindfully enjoying spoonfuls of breakfast, and sips of coffee between scribbling lines of reflections in the journal she often kept in the windowsill here. Life had changed so much in such a short amount of time. Eventually, her slow morning would liven up. She’d head out for a yoga class or walk to the library. But for now, she’d rest here.

I generally don't remember my dreams, and the ones I do are usually pretty vague and mundane, but this one was extremely vivid and strange.

I'm not sure exactly what details about me are most helpful, but I'm a white american in my mid 20s.

I was on the couch with my two cats, a black cat and a tabby, both girls, and noticed my tabby's tail had fallen off. It wasn't bloody or anything, it was like it had a skin-colored peg meant to snap into place that had finally given way. She was extremely calm and aloof throughout the entire dream, but I consider her my best friend so I was immediately terrified for her.

I started walking around my house in a panic. I live alone, so I'm not sure what I was looking for. Eventually I found a kitten that looked a lot like her, so I picked it up and went back to the living room. I saw my cat in the middle of the room straining, and eventually having another small black kitten and two grey kitten-sized puppies?

I tried wrangling them into a laundry basket with a blanket inside, and walked around to try and find my cat again, but when I went into my bedroom there was a larger than average black sphynx cat (neither of my cats look like that) that quickly left through the window.

When I came back, the babies had all escaped, and the two kittens were now running away from me. The kittens' tails eventually also fell off in the chaos. All the tails were just loose on the coffee table and the carpet, and when I tried to pick one up it squirmed out of my grasp. I eventually got all the babies into the basket, where they fell asleep. I don't remember if anything in particular happened to the puppies or my other cat, as I woke up soon after.

I think part of what freaked me out is that I had fallen asleep on my couch in the late evening, and the dream was set in the exact same place at the same time, so it felt particularly real in the moment.

This was the most stressed I've felt in a dream in as long as I can remember. Usually I forget them as soon as I am fully awake, but this one has been sticking with me for hours.

I will say, it's been okay for the most part. I've been keeping myself busy with building new furniture, moving to a new apartment, and running errands. I admit I'm using the 3mg pouches (averaging around 2-3 a day...hoping to get that number down as my next big goal). I actually feel better, more energy, noticed better breathing already, and honestly I guess I'm just kind of proud of myself for ditching it after all these years.

What I'm struggling with is the mental battle. I would vape on my drive to work or wherever I was going. When watching TV. When on my computer completing various tasks. Before bed. After meals. With my coffee in the morning. It was like part of my routine and now it just feels like something is missing. It sounds silly, that something so little had such a part in all of these everyday tasks/routines. It feels embarrassing in a sense, that I was chained to something the size of my finger lol. I know it's probably normal for me to still crave it at this point in my journey, but when does this feeling go away?

Any and all advice appreciated, and good luck to all in their journey!",1,1767758422.0,QuitVaping,2,1.0,False

**The problem:** AI helps me code 5x faster. It also writes bugs 1.7x more often than I do (CodeRabbit's research, not mine). Professional review tools cost more than my monthly coffee budget.

**What I built:** An AI-powered code auditor that scans your repos and tells you what's actually dangerous, not just what's ""not best practice.""

**Tech stack:**

* Frontend: Next.js, TailwindCSS, glassmorphism UI
* Backend: Vercel serverless functions
* Database: PostgreSQL (Neon) with smart indexing
* AI: DeepSeek v3.2 Reasoner with heavily customized prompts for security analysis
* Auth: GitHub OAuth

**Cool features:**

Priority scanning - security files first, then core logic, then polish. You don't wait for the full scan to see if you're leaking API keys.

Real-time streaming - results appear live as the AI reads your code

Vibe Score algorithm - 0-100 health score based on issue severity and frequency

Scan history tracking - see how your code quality changes over time

Demo mode - 3 free scans per month, no credit card

**What makes it different from linters:**

The AI doesn't just flag issues. It explains them like a senior dev reviewing your PR. ""This is vulnerable because..."" instead of ""Security issue detected.""

Nearly all dialling in tips as well as ratios are either for light or dark roast, but I swear nearly all beans that you find most commonly at speciality coffee shops are medium roast. So how to dial in, and what recipes to use?

That one time I got lost on a mountain, at  night, and people took bets...","Back in September of 2024, I joined an introductory guided bike packing course. It was fun! Except.. I missed the carpool :/ rats.. 

So I took the local bus system (I traveled 60 miles from home, to the mountain's nearest gas station stop. The bus is for skiers and snowboarders, mountain bikers.) and got to the mountain around 4pm. 4 hours to bus there. 

Then I bike 8 miles along the interstate highway, to get to the trailhead. Unfortunately, our group leaders did not tell us the route, just the general area. It was a surprise weekend overnighter 50 mile bike packing trip. I did not have time to print off maps -\_\_\_\_- and most of the people there use fancy smancy ride-with-gps. 

So I only had a vague idea of where the trails go, where I needed to head off to, and I pestered one of the ride leaders about WHERE they would be, for the night. 

So I literally bike off of US highway 26, on Mt Hood in Oregon, USA. I stupidly headed down the PCT trail, which is illegal. I kept walking, biking and heading SSW and got lost 4 times. I ran into camping PCT hikers, who gave  me directions. I wrote those down. The logging road signs were illegible :/ of course. It got dark soon, and I was biking 4-5 hours in the dark, alone, in some Mt Hood wilderness logging roads. My one head light barely making anything visible. 

Eventually, I find myself seeing the huge clearing of a lake, and the moon was reflecting enough into the ambient sky, that I was able to read the wind and land, to figure out I was going in the right direction.  I used my intensive wilderness survival skills to quickly asses which road to follow, and took that road. 

Later, I found myself with quite the sight: few/no people around, no cars, and the huge full moon illuminating the entire lake :) 

I got to camp at 9am, and everyone was in shock. I quickly set up my hammock camp, and went to sleep. 

The next morning, the group ride leader was amazed, he said that there's still men in the world. I ate my bacon egg bagel sandwich, drank my coffee black, and smoked my tobacco pipe. I traveled around 20 miles because I was lost. The other group leads and the students were literally taking bets on me either giving up, coming out and getting lost, or even making it to the camp. LOL no one betted on me actually getting to camp just fine. 

By this point, I was homeless for about a year, and I bike pack in the dark, off into the woodlands, to find safe refuge. So for me, this was child's play. 

The next day, we had 1,300ft of elevation gain over 26 miles, and I came out first or second place and did not bonk a single time. ",6,1767757694.0,NightCycling,5,1.0,False

And taking your life as a whole, with all your innumerable choices, all your life long you are slowly turning this central thing into a heavenly creature, or a hellish creature.” — C.S. Lewis.*

*—*

***“But what of the third option? The third thing? The creature of that land in between Heaven and Hell—No, wait, such a space is not between but beyond, beyond the armies of Heaven and Hell—No ‘Tertium Quid’, for it is not dependent on a duality. In a ‘land’ touched neither by life nor death; grace nor sin; love nor hate. A land without name until we have tongues to speak of it and eyes to interpret its ‘otherness’, its foreign symbols of reality that we cannot presently understand. We cannot understand as we are now. We must become neither heavenly nor hellish. We must become the third thing.”***

“Okaaaaaay, that’s enough Internet for tonight,” Mike exhaled as he shut his laptop and stood. He walked over to his desk and cleared a space for the laptop amidst the mess of loose paper and coffee mugs. Half-drawn monsters stared at him from their second-dimensional homes. Mike stared back for a moment, eyes flicking to the drawing pencils taunting him from a corner of the desk. After a few moments, however, he sighed and returned to his bed, breaking a promise to himself and pulling out his phone.

“Where have I heard that before…” he wondered as he typed in the quote from the YouTube video. A few searches later and he found himself staring into the face of some old balding English guy with saggy eyes and a tobacco pipe in his mouth.

“Oh, it’s the magic wardrobe guy,” Mike mumbled, flicking the screen and returning restlessly to YouTube. He wondered what he should be doing as he began to scroll. A million little voices whispered the futilities of “should”. He should probably just go to bed. But he doesn’t want to surrender to sleep just yet. Just a little longer, a few more minutes, maybe an hour, tops. He has class tomorrow and an assignment due. It’s lying on his desk somewhere, a half-finished landscape he gave up on after only a few hours of work. He’ll turn it in and get an F but who cares. Maybe he can suck up to the professor a bit, say something artsy about being burnt out and “just trying to work on myself”. It had worked in the past, but it always made him feel awful after all was said and done; like by saying it in such… sterile, corporate speak he would rip the truth from the feeling’s soul. What that left him with he wasn’t sure… something neither truly felt, nor truly expressed. Some sort of… third thing?

A third thing. The idea stuck to his mind, latching on to what few grooves hadn’t yet been smoothed out by the blue light of his phone. He swiped the screen and dove into his viewing history. An art tutorial there, a sad music playlist here—there it was.

***“The Land Beyond Duality: Becoming the Third Thing”***

A buddy from class had sent it to him a few days ago. It was nonsensical and weird and of poor quality—kinda like his friend's art. Mike took a screenshot of the thumbnail and texted it to his buddy.

    MIKE: Hey man, sooooo wtf is up with this vid? What’s this “third thing” all about?
    
    GABE: audiofile.wav

Gabe’s reply was nearly instantaneous. Mike hesitated, his thumb hovering above the play button. He felt… strange. Off, somehow. Heightened—Like that feeling you get when you gain perspective on something in your past; when you recognize the significance of a decision, one you had once derided as arbitrary.

But then the feeling was gone, drowned out by the soothing smoke from his dab pen. He set it back on his bedside table before pressing play. For a moment he thought the file was sent by accident, a butt-text or something. All these new AI-voice-activated-doohickies that never seem to actually work the way they’re supposed to get on his nerves.

But then, static. White noise drifted from the phone’s speakers. Gooseflesh spread across his arms. He shifted in his bed, stretching his back and sitting up straighter as he listened to the audio. It had an effect on his mind and pulled him upwards, like a puppeteer straightening his dolls as they take the stage. Mike took a deep breath, a tingly sensation spreading throughout his body. Something sang within the static. A voiceless song of words whose forms have been rejected and tossed into hell; No, not hell. Somewhere else.

The goose-flesh refused to die down. Mike double-checks the audio file.

“That can’t be right,” he whispered. Something was wrong with the playtime.

    ‘00:47 - ∞’

Mike tried to pause the track, but his thumb just bounced uselessly against the tiny play button as the song continued. His thumb. His breath caught in his throat as he stared at his thumb, moving it back and forth slowly, unable to understand. He’d always had a crazy hitchhiker’s thumb. It was so bad that, with a little effort, he could bend it back to a full 90° angle.

Only now it was straight as an arrow and refusing to bend. Mike could feel his heart racing. He jumped out of bed, his head and body heavy from the weed. He ran a hand through his hair as he began to pace back and forth in front of his desk. Was this real? He began to question if he had ever actually had a hitchhiker’s thumb in the first place. He thought about being a kid and swinging from monkey bars; how he was always the weakest runt of his class and couldn’t swing further than the third bar. The third bar always held him up. What was past the third bar? He tried to picture his hands wrapped around colorful lead-painted metal. How should his thumbs wrap around the hot steel? What did a hitchhiker's thumb look like anyway?

He froze as he passed his desk once more, a coughing fit suddenly overtaking him. It was like the song had grown claws and was scratching his throat. He hacked and gagged; something was coming up. Images of the evening’s greasy burrito dinner flashed nauseatingly across his mind. Specks of saliva and bile spilled out over the desk, until, finally, something emerged, flying across the hazy room. It bounced and rolled across the table for a moment before coming to a standstill beneath the desk lamp. Warm orange-yellow light washed over the thing. Wisps of dab-pen smoke flitted softly through the still-stagnant air of the dorm.

“So that’s what it looks like,” Mike heard himself say. The severed thumb beneath the desk light most certainly belonged to a hitchhiker. It slotted itself perfectly in every memory Mike could conjure of his hands. That was his thumb. That was really his thumb.

Mike felt himself begin to cough again. The coughing turned into gagging, the sonic energy of the song giving rise to something within him. Something was working its way up from his stomach. He felt hot. Sweat began to leak from every pore on his skin. His blood was on fire. He saw, from the corner of his bulging eyes, his dab pen, still resting on the bedside table. A panic grew in him. Something was wrong. Something was really really wrong. Had he been laced? Was the cart bad? What was going on? Why won’t the song stop?

Despite his attempts to eject whatever was in him, nothing solid came up. But something solid was growing. He felt full, stuffed to the brim like he’d just gone for a walk around the block after Thanksgiving dinner. A skittering sound drew his eyes back to the desk. A trail of black blood ran from where the thumb had been to where it was now; tiny tendrils, like the million legs of a centipede, sprouted from the base of the thumb—delicate tentacles of congealed blood dancing beneath its frame as it glided across the surface of the table. It rubbed itself against the drawing pencils, pawing at their barely-used surfaces, pricking itself on their sharpened points. The light trail of gore it had smeared across the table began to spread, abandoned filaments of blood squirming like parasites in search of a new host—hosts they quickly found. Half-drawn monstrosities suddenly began to emerge from their two-dimensional prisons. Some crawled to join the thumb in its worship of the pencils. Some opened their mouths to join in with the infinite song. They reached with misshapen limbs, twisted forms that croaked and cackled with the melody of doom that echoed round and round Mike as he fumbled, body straining to be free of its torment.

Mike opened his mouth to vomit on the floor of his dorm. Fingers and toes and knuckles and eyes spilled forth, all covered in squirming red worms that at once set about their foul work of arranging the spilled contents of his stomach into a grotesque collage of gore and flesh. He stumbled forward, the weight of his bulging stomach making it harder and harder to stand. The skin of his torso stretched wide, ripped away, tearing itself apart.

His gut leaked, vile hot singing fluid. His ears rang as he sat down. Blood dripped from his earlobes and down the side of his neck—he dipped his fingers in the blood and began to smear it across a blank page. The song rose ever higher in pitch. It was all he could hear now. He continued to vomit; beautiful new colors teeming with unseen potential came up from within him. They covered his desk as he frantically reached for his pencils and began to draw. A thin line scratched his back. A sketch left marks on his thighs. An outline carved itself into his flesh and drew more blood. The more detail he added, the further he brought his creation into being, the more the drawing exacted its price from him.

The more he drew, the more the room faded. It was just him and his children and his ever-growing stomach. Him and his art and his flesh, his true flesh. Nothing else mattered. The colors drifted in front of him; his blood ascended to a distant horizon, vibrating to the frequency of the eternal song. He drew new monsters, new children; they cared for him as his body failed and his flesh sloughed off from his frame, replaced here and there by the material provided from whatever had made its home within his stomach.

The stomach was the last thing to come up. It slowly, painfully emerged from his mouth, the attached organs trailing out and scattering across the room, carried away by the children. The stomach pulsed like a heart, a bright light from somewhere deep within shone through the thin veil of flesh. It was bloated and immense, still growing even as it sat on the desk. Mike felt the finale approaching, the crescendo of an infinite song. He padded forward on hands not his own, feeling the warm embrace of the stomach through skin recycled and discolored. He squeezed his way inside the flesh of his stomach, though he knew it was no longer his. He crawled and crawled and crawled, deeper into his own pit of gluttony. The song came from within. He was going somewhere. Neither heaven, nor hell. A third place.

And he would not be himself when he arrived. For he was no longer alive, and yet he was not dead. He was something else.

I finally got a Pilot Vanishing Point because I wanted to get one before prices rose. Why did no one ever tell me how buttery smooth it is? I absolutely love it!

Went out for brunch, wandered around a random art exhibit, and even treated myself to that ridiculously overpriced coffee I normally skip. There’s something freeing about not having to compromise on what you want to do, and I feel like I’m finally learning how to enjoy my own company without feeling awkward.

Ended the day with a little outdoor movie screening in the park, just me, a blanket, and way too much popcorn. People kept asking if I was waiting for someone, and I just smiled and said nope. It felt so good to realize I don’t need someone else to make a day memorable. Honestly, I might make this a regular thing.

We're from a very ""red"" suburb in the southern United States. We met when we were 11 and were fast friends. Our houses were about a 10 minute walk apart. When we were 14ish she had a religious awakening and distanced herself from me, because her religious friends said I was a ""bad influence"" (read: lesbian. They were right, but I didn't know it yet. I also didn't know that this was why we stopped being friends until she told me years later. I thought we just grew apart). Then covid hit and we missed the second half of sophomore year. When we came back, I heard a rumor that she was a lesbian and sought her out. To make a long, dramatic, cliche story short, we were weirdly-close best friends for two years before a dramatic love confession led to a relationship at 18. 

It wasn't perfect. She was very high maintenance, and I was super insecure. We had to sneak around to avoid our families realizing we weren't just gal pals. We committed to colleges in different cities. That's a lot for an 18 year old to handle, so, the day before I started my new college and she moved away, I broke up with her. It was awful. We went no contact. 

I sort of got over it. I stopped thinking about her every second, then every hour, then every day. Eventually, I made friends. I even started openly dating, since my new city was a lot more accepting. No one ever made me feel the way she made me feel. I can even remember the fist time the two of us hung out post-covid. There was never a moment of weirdness or awkwardness, something that's extremely difficult for me. We were both introverts, but we could hang out every day for hours without getting tired of each other. I never found that again, even in platonic relationships. I chocked it up to the fact that I wasn't a kid anymore, and adults just don't feel that way. I convinced myself that it was raging teen hormones convincing me I was in love, and that real love must be nothing like what I was feeling. 

Three years passed with no contact, then a week ago, she texted me to wish me a happy 22nd birthday. I was shocked, but I couldn't help but smile like an idiot when I saw her name pop up on my phone. I replied, we had a quick conversation, and I invited her for coffee since we're both on winter break. 

I went because I was so different than I was when she knew me. That's what I used to tell myself when I missed her--that I had changed so much, and she had too, and the person I was missing didn't really exist anymore. I wanted to prove to myself we were strangers. I thought we might have an hour of awkward catching up before saying ""Let's do this again when we're both in town!"" And never speaking again. 

That's not what happened. The person I miss *does* exist, and she's better than I remember. 

We sat in the coffee shop for four and a half hours. From the second I walked in and our eyes met, I just felt so stupid happy. Only about half an hour was spent on the breakup. She said she was sorry, I said I was sorry, and we both laughed about what idiots we were when we were 18. Then we just talked about what we were up to and what we planned to be up to after graduation. She's passionate about her future, something she never wanted to talk about in the past. She's a lot more sociable now. The conversation just flowed; We always understood exactly what the other one meant; We finished each other's sentences a few times. Oh, and did I mention she was just, like, angelically gorgeous? She's always been beautiful, but she's seriously grown into herself. We only left because she had plans, or else we could have sat there forever. When we left, we agreed to be friends. She started texting me before I even finished driving home, and we haven't stopped since. 

I was so stupid happy that I didn't even realize there was a pit in my stomach until I tried to sleep. 

Dear God. What if this is it? What if I got one person, and I broke up with her when I was 18 like an idiot? I asked her to get coffee to prove to myself that she was just a person, but what if she *isn't*? How well could we have grown together, if I hadn't broken up with her? Would we be making plans for a life together, instead of meeting to catch up? 

I know it's pointless to wonder. I can't go back, and we certainly can't just pick up where we left off. I'm moving states in August. The reason we broke up in the first place was because I felt like my life was so unstable, and it certainly isn't any more stable now. 

I just feel so sick. It's been two days and I just needed to get this out. I have therapy in two days, so that'll help. I just feel so...ugh. I don't know what to say, or what to do, or if I've ever made a good decision in my life. 

Anyway. Thank you for listening, I guess. TL;DR: I went to coffee with my ex for closure after three years of no contact and accidentally had the time of my life. ",1,1767757262.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

Rating: 7.5/10
""Honestly a solid piece for winter. I dig the reversible feature—the fleece side looks cozy, but the nylon side in this pic looks a bit deflated and wrinkly. Might need a steam or some wear to puff it up properly. The Coyote/Brown colorway is versatile, but the zipper hardware looks a little flimsy in the photo. Good daily driver, but nothing mind-blowing.""

2. The North Face Nuptse (Black)
**Rating: 8/10**
""You can't really go wrong with a black Nuptse, it’s a staple for a reason. That said, it is the 'NPC uniform' of winter. The puffiness here looks decent, not too flat. My main gripe with these is usually the collar shape—sometimes it sits weirdly against the neck. If the down fill is good, it’s a keep, but don't expect to stand out in a crowd.""

3. Ami Paris Big Heart Sweater
**Rating: 6/10**
""Unpopular opinion maybe, but the massive Ami de Coeur logo is getting a bit played out. It screams 'I bought this for the logo.' The grey knit looks clean and the stitching on the 'A' seems tight, but I’m worried about the wool quality. These tend to pill super fast or feel itchy if the material blend is cheap. Clean look, just a bit basic.""

4. Purple Brand Denim Jacket
**Rating: 5.5/10**
""This is... a lot. The paint splatter and distress effect feels a bit forced and artificial in this lighting. It gives off strong 2016 hypebeast vibes. If you style it with plain black pants it might work, but it’s a loud piece. The fit on Purple Brand is usually tight/fitted, so if you prefer the boxy/baggy trend, you might hate how this sits.""

5. Gallery Dept. Long Sleeve Tee
Rating: 7/10**
""Clean graphic. The 'Bar Dé Music' print is one of their better, more low-key designs. The blank looks decent, maybe a bit thin? The cuffs look like they might lose elasticity quickly. It’s a cool layering piece, but for what it is (literally a cotton long sleeve), it’s nothing crazy. Good for a chill fit.""

6. Acne Studios 'Mud Wash' / Chain Print Jeans
Rating: 9/10**
""Best item in the haul, hands down. The wash and the trompe-l'œil (optical illusion) chain print are sick. It fits that grimey/grunge aesthetic perfectly. My only concern is styling—these are hard to pull off without looking like you literally rolled in dirt. If you have the right boots and cropped top/hoodie, these are fire. If not, they just look messy.""

7. Corteiz Velvet Track Jacket**
Rating: 7/10
""The velvet texture looks plush, definitely a comfy piece. Corteiz is huge right now, so the hype is there. However, black velvet is a lint magnet. You are going to be using a lint roller every time you leave the house. Also, the elastic banding at the hem looks a little loose/cheap. Good for a cozy UK drip vibe, but high maintenance.""

8. Off-White 'Out of Office' (OOO) Sneakers
Rating: 8.5/10**
""Super clean colorway. The white and grey is way more wearable than the loud colors Off-White usually does. The leather cuts look smooth and the shape is correct (chunky but not clown shoes). Just be warned, these are heavy on foot. If you plan on walking all day in these, your feet might get tired. Solid pickup.""

9. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Taupe)
Rating: 9.5/10**
""Certified classic. You literally cannot hate on these. The suede looks buttery and the color is perfect for neutral tones. They go with sweatpants, jeans, shorts, whatever. The only downside is keeping that suede clean—one drop of coffee or rain and it's game over. Make sure you spray them with protector immediately.""

10. Purple Brand Distressed Jeans (Black)
Rating: 5/10
""Meh. Similar to the jacket, the distressing here looks kinda cheap, specifically the checkered patches peeking through. It feels very 'mall fashion.' The skinny/stacked fit is also kind of dying out in favor of baggy denim. If you're going for a rockstar look, they work, but otherwise, I’d pass on these for something with a better wash.""

11. Fear of God Essentials 1/2 Zip Pullover (Nylon)
Rating: 7/10
""This is way better than their standard cotton hoodies that everyone and their grandma wears. The nylon gives it a nice technical/sporty vibe while keeping that signature boxy FOG silhouette. My only issue with these is the material noise—you literally sound like a walking bag of chips when you move. Also, the elastic on the waist looks really aggressive; expect it to ride up constantly if you don't layer it right.""

12. 'Lucky Me I See Ghosts' Hoodie (Kids See Ghosts)**
Rating: 6.5/10
""Ah, the holy grail of 2018 hypebeasts. Honestly, this piece feels a bit dated now. The puff print on the text looks decent—it’s got that 3D texture you want—but be careful washing it because that puff *will* crack and peel eventually. The wash on the grey fabric looks okay, maybe a bit too dark compared to retail, but it's hard to tell without natural light. Cool for the nostalgia, but a bit loud for 2026.""

13. Ralph Lauren Pony Socks (3-Pack)
Rating: 8/10
""Not much to say here, they are socks. You're paying for the little horse embroidery, let's be real. They are definitely cleaner than standard Nike socks for wearing with loafers or low-top sneakers like the OOOs or Birkenstocks you posted earlier. They tend to pill after a few washes though, so enjoy the crisp white look while it lasts. Solid essential.""

14. Ralph Lauren Cable Knit Sweater (Cream)**
Rating: 8.5/10
""This is the 'Old Money' starter pack final boss. It’s a super safe, versatile piece that makes you look put-together instantly. The cable knitting gives it good texture so it doesn't look cheap. It pairs perfectly with the fatigue pants or denim from your previous haul. Just make sure it’s not too thin; some of the newer RL knits feel flimsy. If the weight is good, this is a wardrobe staple.""

Carol: No one from upstate you could ask?

Lois: Not really. They’d get the wrong idea and no one is intending to be with.

Carol: Let’s see who in this company would be worth asking? Well no one in your department. Not ethical. Too young.

Sales department? Too married too divorced too sleepy.

Lois: Carol you do love to stereotype.

Carol: Yea makes it easier to eliminate the unworthy.

Ok Accounting? Nah old men and young women.

Executives? Old but they do have money.

Lois: it’s just a date for a wedding. Must be someone my age and normal. (Sigh)

Lois: Who?

Carol: Nick from IT

Lois: Really? No. Hmmm Let me think about it.

Carol: But don’t over think it.

Back to work.

Next day Lois went into the break room first thing in the morning. Something she rarely does. But she had a need for caffeine. Pouring a cup of coffee was Nick from IT.

Nick: Good morning Lois. Can I pour you a cup?

Lois nodded yes.

As Nick poured Lois said: Nick can I ask you something? She pointed the way to a far table.

Lois: I need to ask you something in private Nick. But not here. Can you meet me tomorrow after work? But not at anyplace around here.

Nick: Sure Lois. Text me later and we’ll figure a place to meet. I have a meeting right now.

Lois: that’ll work.

She let out a sigh of relief.

Nick was wondering what it was all about. But he had work to do.

Later that day Lois texted Nick: Do you have any place we can chat away from work area?

Nick texted: You live in Hatboro and I live in Chalfont. How about Jim’s in Warminster? Just up York rd from you.

Lois: ok I know where that is. 7 pm?

Nick: ok good. I’ll meet you at the bench outside.

At 6:50 Nick sat down on the bench in front of Jim’s. He figured it would be easier for Lois If he was there first.

Two minutes later Lois was there.

Lois: Nick thanks for coming. You must be wondering what is so private not to talk at or near work.

Nick: Lois I had several ideas what it could be. Most were too incredible to make any sense.

But let’s get a seat and relax a second.

They were seated at a booth. Lois ordered white wine, Nick a beer.

Nick: Lois what would you like to eat? They have excellent roast beef sandwiches.

Lois: Oh nothing for me thanks. I’m too nervous.

Nick: Says the girl who probably only had coffee for breakfast. Eat half her sandwich for lunch. And now is drinking wine .

Lois: Nick have you been spying on me? I had a bagel for breakfast and almost ate all my sandwich for lunch. Ok? (Ok had a sarcastic tone)

Nick: I’m going to order a few appetizers. You can watch me eat or eat them too.

I think I’ll have loaded tater tots, stuffed mushrooms and mozzarella sticks.

Lois: Did you say stuffed mushrooms? Oh I love them. Oh they have onion rings and chicken bites.

Nick good idea! We can chat and eat comfort foods.

Nick: I thought you may pass out on me if you didn’t eat.

So what did you want to ask me?

Lois took a sip of her wine. Took a deep breath and said: I have a wedding I’m invited to and I was wondering if you would be my date?

Nick: What happened to Jake your boyfriend?

Lois: he hasn’t been around since before Christmas.

Nick: Oh sorry

Lois: Time to move on.

Nick: About time… to talk about the wedding.

Lois: The wedding is two weeks from Saturday. It’s upstate and I have to be there for the rehearsal dinner on Friday. It would be great if you could get Friday off and we can go together. You can stay at my parents house with me and use my brothers old room.

Nick: No problem. I have enough days owed me to get off.

But I do have a few questions.

Lois: Ok nothing that would make you back out?

Nick: No just informational questions.

N: Ok I think we’re done with the appetizers and drinks. Time to go before I say something more.

L: Are you blushing? Oh sorry. We better go.

Thanks Nick for agreeing to be my date. And thanks for a great night and good food.

N: I had a great time too!

Lois returned home feeling relieved and relaxed. She immediately texted Carol.

L: Carol are you here?

C: I’m here. What’s up?

L: Are you alone?

C: Yes. Call me.

L: (on the phone) Saw Nick in the break room. “Can I ask you something in private? But not here. Some place away from work tomorrow night after work.” We met at Jim’s in Warminster.

He insisted I have some food with my wine. I must have looked anxious.

C: Yes when you’re anxious overwhelmed and little food you almost look like you’re going to pass out.

L: Does everyone know about this?

C: Only the ones who care about you.

L: He picked 4 good appetizers and I added 1.

I took a deep breath and a big sip of wine. I told him I had a wedding to go to and would he be my date. He smiled and then looked puzzled. What happened to Jake? Told him. He said he’d be happy to be my date. I gave him the details etc. He had a ton of questions. Said he wanted to know about my family so he could have conversations with them. I never thought he wanted to be proactive.

C: Nick really is a great guy.

L: Then I told him he couldn’t tell anyone. No one at work, none of his friends. I even said not his parents until after the wedding .

I said I have to tell my family brides family and my brother and sister in law. And if it’s okay with him I want to tell you Carol. It was ok with him because you kept some secrets for him. Ok Carol what secrets?

C: I can’t tell you without Nick’s permission.

L: Is it about me?

C: No comment

L: Nick said that too.

C: So did it go well? Will you be able to make it work?

L: Better than I thought. I think I’m going to have a good time.

Monday before the wedding Lois texts Nick

L: Mr I’m in the mood for some stuffed mushrooms. Are you interested?

N: Absolutely! Jim’s about 6:30?

L: Yes that works for me.

N: I’ll meet you at the bench.

L: Why not inside?

N: Because a guy likes to walk into a place with a pretty girl by his side.

L: So you think I’m pretty?

N: Lois stop trying to make me blush and get back to work. I’ll see you at 6:30

At 6:30 Nick saw Lois sitting on the bench.

Lois stands up twirlers around and says teasingly

L: Hi Nick. Am I pretty enough for you today?

N: Every day Lois!

That surprised her. She thought he’d laugh it off.

L: I can’t stay long. Want to get my work cleared up before I or we go to the wedding.

N: Yes me too!

L: Update on the wedding. I told my cousin I was bringing a date. Not Jake the snake she said? I told her I was bringing the guy I was dancing with at the Christmas party.

N: You told her about that? I almost punched Jake that night.

Who else did you tell?

L: Just Linda my sister in law. The three of us are pretty close. I had to tell someone. Who did you tell?

N: Carol and your boss calmed me down . Mr. Logan said I should have decked him but thanked me for being calm.

L: Oh I need to know what you want to eat at the wedding. Beef salmon pasta vegan.

N: What are you having?

L: Beef I don’t like salmon.

N: Then I’ll have the salmon. But we have to exchange bites. Ok?

L: Do I have to?

N: Yes you do. lol

What time do you want to leave Friday?

L: 7 ok ? Mom will have a late breakfast for us and we have shopping to do. So you’re going to be alone with my dad.

N: Now you know why I asked so many questions. We have a few things we can chat about.

L: He’ll probably ask about you.

N: I’ll assure your dad my intentions are purely honorable when it comes to Lois.

L: That’s funny. Luv to see that conversation.

N: Here’s to a fun weekend.

At 7 am Nick knocks on Lois’s door

L: Come on in Nick

N: Good morning Lois. You all set? Got everything? Just two bags and garment bag?

L: Let’s get going. I’m anxious to get there.

N: Stop for coffee?

L: You read my mind. Wawa coffee please.

N: Good because I don’t do Starbucks. Too expensive.

Loaded up with two 24oz coffees and a breakfast burrito each.

N: Ok what town to I put in the GPS?

L: Wyoming

N: The state?

L: No it’s a town in Pa

N: Ok got it. Radio? Music?

L: Sure but just in the background.

N: Isn’t nice not to have to get dressed up first thing? You dress down nice.

L: No one ever said I’m a good dress downer.

N: Yes we always see each other in business attire.

L: But more formal attire tonight and tomorrow. Can’t wait to see everyone.

N: So tell me Miss Lois what secret thing does Lois do that would surprise people?

L: Ok Mr Nick. But you have to go first.

N: Oh you turned the tables on me. Well I watch YouTube videos about the rich billionaire who bumps into a waitress or hires a new woman employee. He falls in love with them because they don’t want anything from him. He stalks her until she agrees to go to a formal dinner with him. He buys her gown shoes etc. come on we know he’s just trying to get into her pants.

L: Nick is that what you’re trying to do to me? Get into my pants?

N: What?! Why are you always teasing me and making me blush?

L: Because it’s so easy to tease you. Besides you blush a nice shade of red!

N: Ugh you’re exasperating .

But these are YouTube videos so it’s strictly pg13. Eventually he proposes with an a ring in a velvet box. Every story has the box. All the rings are elegant but simple. Yea right! Guy with billions goes for a cheap ring. Always no big weddings and most stories the guy quits his job to run a coffee shop. Nice to have a golden parachute to retire on. Never has any kids.

Why can’t they be normal people trying to find real love get married have kids and try to live life as best they can?

But I keep watching them hoping something will be different.

L: Interesting. Never know what you get on

YouTube.

My thing is I like to watch old black and white movies. Love Fred Astir and Ginger Roger movies. Thin Man series is great. And a lot more. I usually watch them by myself.

N: Interesting choice of movies.

Some construction workers were puttin in the wood foundation for the two landing pads. Gravel was dumped off. A baco leveled rhe gravel. Big rolling machine flattenes it and Baco spread it out.

A second baco seemed to be digging a trench. When I asked Aino about this. The two flat pads will be shittle pads and the trench will hold a pipe to refuel the shuttles.

I should talk to lady which came to help us make bio diesel. I guess I am curious if Shuttle fuel will be created also. We might be able to sell both to those in need. That would be good money for the Baronry.

Any shuttle needing refueling while here. Might also organize to sell fuel to the Station to refuel and sell ships depending on amount we can produce.

To my surprise a bunch of cloths and sanitary packs was dropped off to Newtown. 

The construction workers and many other volunteers emptied the cargo container. It will be sorted and what ever we cannot use will be sent to where Haego needs it most by shuttle.

Aino agreed about dedicating one large storefront to tablets to sell.we can be the distributor for Haego. Most people assigned here will be willing to save money by purchasing from us.

3 humans and 1 Ykanti that know teck will set up a shop and advertise to Garden's and Station for us. Contacted Rat Man and orderes 50 cheap tablets, 25 medium Quality and 10 top end tablets. Some for display and rest will be storage.

Carpenters built shelves to storage in back and disllay cases in front. I also ordered a bunch of accesories including extra chords and Tablet cases.

Anna brought me a coffee and asked if I would try a restairant she as not tried yet with her. I agreed and we will meet in 2 hours for lunch and walk there together.

It is odd to see a transport trailer being lifter by shuttle. Aino told me he is picking up cement mix powder and dropping it off at cement factory. By tomorrow cement is starting to be poured for Pads.

The engineers are now marking the new heavy duty road.

Anna joined me for cards after work. Anna, my Ykanti cleaner and myself taught each other simple game of cards and played for about 2 hours

~ The closest thing to some relief: The glycenate rectal insert small cone looking thing. One a day. However, Ive had to use 2x recently to get some movement going. That doesn’t even produce that much. 

~ Currently on L-theanine, Magnesium glycenate, L-Citrulline (male side effects) and the occasional 10MG adderall IR (maybe twice a week). Clonodine too. All these were reintroduced last week because I went off all of them 45 days ago to see if they caused any constipation. 

I’ve noticed lots of chocolates and junk food had be going for 3x days up to 2x a day. Considering introducing alcohol again just to get the beer shits (Im booze free) Smoked and did Shrooms that weekend too - maybe it helped? Maybe it was the munchies that finally made me go.

I also made a vegan guide that sheds light on the food options there, since most of it wasn't online. I hope this helps others who need it! Big thanks to all the previous suggestions from people on this sup in my earlier post.


The Elvis Presley Memphis
Glady's Diner
They had chips & fries with a vegan burger. Nothing really special about the three of them, but what did stand out was the veggie topping bar, so you can fill up your burger with toppings. 

Rock and Go
they had a veggie wrap, but I forgot to ask for the ingredients, but they most likely can be made vegan. They sell coffee & lattes, and have two vegan milks (oat & almond), which they can use to make vegan smoothies!  They also had a veggie salad, fruit cups, and potato chips.

Vernon's Steakhouse
Admittedly did not enter this, since I was full from the earlier food, and I was exhausted after a full day, but I snuck a peek at their menu. They had a vegan salad and veggies of the south. 

Gift shop foods.
The dark chocolate bars are vegan! Got excited to have a little desert. 
The mints are vegan.
They have hot sauces, and those were both vegan as well. I bought the ""All Shook Up"" sauce. 
They have shaved ice, but it wasn't open during the winter


The Guest House was far less vegan friendly. 
Shake, Rattle, and Go
They had bagels, which you could get with a topping. Nothing else food wise, BUT they did have 4 vegan milks (Soy, oat, almond, coconut). This was exciting because they usually only have 1-2.

I tried to ask about the nightly PBJ, but they had no idea sadly 😔 

EP's Bar and Grill
They had nothing, sadly. I'm sure if you asked they could whip something up. 

Delta's Kitchen was a mixed bag. disappointing. For breakfast, only the potatoes, fruit, and berries were vegan. 
The dinner did have several good looking salads, but they had to be slightly altered to remove the dairy. I do appreciate that the vegan options are cheaper than the non-vegan option of adding meat.

There were not that many fully vegan restaurants near Graceland, but they are several in Memphis. Here is a small list.

Rating: 7.5/10
""Honestly a solid piece for winter. I dig the reversible feature—the fleece side looks cozy, but the nylon side in this pic looks a bit deflated and wrinkly. Might need a steam or some wear to puff it up properly. The Coyote/Brown colorway is versatile, but the zipper hardware looks a little flimsy in the photo. Good daily driver, but nothing mind-blowing.""

2. The North Face Nuptse (Black)
**Rating: 8/10**
""You can't really go wrong with a black Nuptse, it’s a staple for a reason. That said, it is the 'NPC uniform' of winter. The puffiness here looks decent, not too flat. My main gripe with these is usually the collar shape—sometimes it sits weirdly against the neck. If the down fill is good, it’s a keep, but don't expect to stand out in a crowd.""

3. Ami Paris Big Heart Sweater
**Rating: 6/10**
""Unpopular opinion maybe, but the massive Ami de Coeur logo is getting a bit played out. It screams 'I bought this for the logo.' The grey knit looks clean and the stitching on the 'A' seems tight, but I’m worried about the wool quality. These tend to pill super fast or feel itchy if the material blend is cheap. Clean look, just a bit basic.""

4. Purple Brand Denim Jacket
**Rating: 5.5/10**
""This is... a lot. The paint splatter and distress effect feels a bit forced and artificial in this lighting. It gives off strong 2016 hypebeast vibes. If you style it with plain black pants it might work, but it’s a loud piece. The fit on Purple Brand is usually tight/fitted, so if you prefer the boxy/baggy trend, you might hate how this sits.""

5. Gallery Dept. Long Sleeve Tee
Rating: 7/10**
""Clean graphic. The 'Bar Dé Music' print is one of their better, more low-key designs. The blank looks decent, maybe a bit thin? The cuffs look like they might lose elasticity quickly. It’s a cool layering piece, but for what it is (literally a cotton long sleeve), it’s nothing crazy. Good for a chill fit.""

6. Acne Studios 'Mud Wash' / Chain Print Jeans
Rating: 9/10**
""Best item in the haul, hands down. The wash and the trompe-l'œil (optical illusion) chain print are sick. It fits that grimey/grunge aesthetic perfectly. My only concern is styling—these are hard to pull off without looking like you literally rolled in dirt. If you have the right boots and cropped top/hoodie, these are fire. If not, they just look messy.""

7. Corteiz Velvet Track Jacket**
Rating: 7/10
""The velvet texture looks plush, definitely a comfy piece. Corteiz is huge right now, so the hype is there. However, black velvet is a lint magnet. You are going to be using a lint roller every time you leave the house. Also, the elastic banding at the hem looks a little loose/cheap. Good for a cozy UK drip vibe, but high maintenance.""

8. Off-White 'Out of Office' (OOO) Sneakers
Rating: 8.5/10**
""Super clean colorway. The white and grey is way more wearable than the loud colors Off-White usually does. The leather cuts look smooth and the shape is correct (chunky but not clown shoes). Just be warned, these are heavy on foot. If you plan on walking all day in these, your feet might get tired. Solid pickup.""

9. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Taupe)
Rating: 9.5/10**
""Certified classic. You literally cannot hate on these. The suede looks buttery and the color is perfect for neutral tones. They go with sweatpants, jeans, shorts, whatever. The only downside is keeping that suede clean—one drop of coffee or rain and it's game over. Make sure you spray them with protector immediately.""

10. Purple Brand Distressed Jeans (Black)
Rating: 5/10
""Meh. Similar to the jacket, the distressing here looks kinda cheap, specifically the checkered patches peeking through. It feels very 'mall fashion.' The skinny/stacked fit is also kind of dying out in favor of baggy denim. If you're going for a rockstar look, they work, but otherwise, I’d pass on these for something with a better wash.""

11. Fear of God Essentials 1/2 Zip Pullover (Nylon)
Rating: 7/10
""This is way better than their standard cotton hoodies that everyone and their grandma wears. The nylon gives it a nice technical/sporty vibe while keeping that signature boxy FOG silhouette. My only issue with these is the material noise—you literally sound like a walking bag of chips when you move. Also, the elastic on the waist looks really aggressive; expect it to ride up constantly if you don't layer it right.""

12. 'Lucky Me I See Ghosts' Hoodie (Kids See Ghosts)**
Rating: 6.5/10
""Ah, the holy grail of 2018 hypebeasts. Honestly, this piece feels a bit dated now. The puff print on the text looks decent—it’s got that 3D texture you want—but be careful washing it because that puff *will* crack and peel eventually. The wash on the grey fabric looks okay, maybe a bit too dark compared to retail, but it's hard to tell without natural light. Cool for the nostalgia, but a bit loud for 2026.""

13. Ralph Lauren Pony Socks (3-Pack)
Rating: 8/10
""Not much to say here, they are socks. You're paying for the little horse embroidery, let's be real. They are definitely cleaner than standard Nike socks for wearing with loafers or low-top sneakers like the OOOs or Birkenstocks you posted earlier. They tend to pill after a few washes though, so enjoy the crisp white look while it lasts. Solid essential.""

14. Ralph Lauren Cable Knit Sweater (Cream)**
Rating: 8.5/10
""This is the 'Old Money' starter pack final boss. It’s a super safe, versatile piece that makes you look put-together instantly. The cable knitting gives it good texture so it doesn't look cheap. It pairs perfectly with the fatigue pants or denim from your previous haul. Just make sure it’s not too thin; some of the newer RL knits feel flimsy. If the weight is good, this is a wardrobe staple.""

1q64a84,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1q64a84/loss_of_motivation/,Loss of motivation,"Hey good fellows of reddit

As the title says, I’ve lost motivation. It started three months ago when I was studying in another city. I began to fall asleep during lectures, and got to a point where coffee wouldn’t keep me up. I was behind on a lot of material and I barely fit in with the other students. I got burnt out and decided to stop the studies and move back home. The university I went to was my dream university and I worked so hard to get in, so I was disappointed and dissatisfied over myself. But I couldn’t bring myself to continue. I got exhausted from all that, and needed a break from school.

I got back home two months ago, and I relaxed for 2-3 weeks, and decided to go back to my hobbies and work towards driver’s license. That lastet for a little while until I got into a fight with my father, which put me back down again. We talked it out, and things got better again. Motivation was building again and I was ready to start working. My sister works at a cinema, and helped me get a job there. I got my schedule and setup in the system, but then my sister decided she didn’t want to work with me after all, and that she felt she got pressured by out parents. That knocked me down again seeing as it was one of my only points of motivation at that point.

I also found out my father had downloaded dating apps, despite being married to my mother, which made me very conflicted and confused, and it took a toll on me. Ended up smashing my guitar into the wall in the buildup of infuriation and basically anger from the last two months (guitar is fine, wall not so much). I managed to clear it up with my parents, but it all still stings.

And now, I almost feel repulsed just thinking about playing the guitar. Even just listening to music feels more burdening. I’ve lost my love for music. I also used to be an avid gamer, but gaming feels more draining than giving. Reading also feels just taxing and my sleepschedule is just barely hanging on. All I do now is just lay in bed and watch stuff on my tablet. Everything just feels so draining, and I wish I had the motivation to at least do the things I enjoy now that I got the time to do so. And I don’t want to feel like this. What can I do?

I’m genuinely trying to check myself here and figure out if I’m overreacting or if my feelings are reasonable.

I (37F) have been dating a man (late 30s M) for a couple of months. Overall, the relationship has been warm, consistent, and affectionate. We talk often, spend a lot of time together, and until now I felt emotionally safe with him.

Here’s where things shifted.

Over time, he’s made several comments that felt judgmental or labeling, especially around my background and upbringing. For example:

	•	When I mentioned drinking coffee as a kid (which is very normal in my culture), he said, “That’s sad to give a kid caffeine.”

	•	He’s made joking comments about where I’m from or how I was raised that felt dismissive.

	•	He’s also labeled me as “corny,” “submissive,” or implied I’m overly agreeable.

Individually, these comments might seem small, but together they started to sting. So I calmly brought it up and said something along the lines of:

“I don’t think you’re trying to hurt me, but when you describe parts of my upbringing as ‘sad,’ it feels judgmental and hurts my feelings. I’m just asking for awareness of how your words land with me.” I honestly felt insulted. 

I was not asking him to change his beliefs, censor himself completely, or apologize endlessly. Just mindfulness.

His response really surprised me.

Instead of engaging with the specific concern, he shifted the conversation into religion and said things like:

	•	“You’re worried about being judged, so I’m worried about our spiritual compatibility because only God can judge me.”

	•	That people who feel judged by others need to examine their spirit and walk with God. 

	•	That this made him question whether we were “equally yoked.”

That felt like a huge leap to me, to go from “this comment hurt my feelings” to questioning my spirituality or emotional maturity. I tried to clarify that I wasn’t questioning our compatibility or his faith, and that I didn’t need theological framing, I just wanted to know if he could be mindful of how his words affect me. He did apologize, but continued to frame it as people being too sensitive or not fully connected to God. 

Now I feel shocked more than sadness. Am I overreacting for feeling hurt and unsettled by this?",12,1767755936.0,AIO,24,1.0,False

1q64374,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestMyApp/comments/1q64374/hi_im_looking_for_testers_for_my_app/,Hi! I'm looking for testers for my app,"***Hi everyone!***

I've been working on a social app called TWIBS that helps people get together with friends. I would love some testers to provide honest feedback and constructive criticism.

The basic idea is to make it easier to let your friends know about casual hangs, e.g. “Anyone want to do the Elysian Park trail on Sunday morning?” by dropping on a pin on the map, without having to spam group chats and text everyone you know. You can type that exact query into the AI Chat, and it will automatically look up the address for the trail and select the best 3D icon for the activity (in this case, a hiking signpost). 

You can also post a flyer or paste a link to an event, and the data will be automatically fetched from the image or URL so you can easily see which friends are going to upcoming shows near you.

Part of the motivation for creating an app like this was to make it easier for people to connect IRL. Life in post-Covid world can be very isolating, and my hope is that an app like this can make it fun to plan stuff and generally lower the bar for getting together in-person. I’ve found it especially useful for automatically pinging friends who frequent the same gyms/coffee shops by having them add those spots to their favorites so that we can easily let each other know when we go to those places. We’ve  also been using it as a quick and simple alternative to Partiful for things like small group dinners.

I'm looking for any kind of feedback, but especially curious about what specific use cases come to mind for you as a tester. Is this an app you would actually use? Why or why not? What can we do to make it better? 

TWIBS is completely free to use, but I’m including an invite code so that I can keep track of how people found it. Totally optional, but if you wouldn't mind, please use code ***TESTMYAPP*** during sign up.

Thank you! :)

I got the bottom drain with the table and all the accessories in since I haven’t run my electrical circuit yet my first brew was a cold brew coffee.  The process was so convenient using the bottom drain and the elevation of the table. And cleaning it in place inside my house without even having to go outside, was really nice.

I was planning to keep my old direct fire pot and strainer because I do low country boils in it.  But I’ve been wondering could I do a Lowcountry boil in the spike solo as well?  I mean, of course I know it will boil water, but I’m curious about the basket having very minimal holes in it.  Like, will it boil properly without the water being able to move in and out of the basket well?  In my mind, I’m envisioning the broth boiling under and all around the basket, bubbling, and splashing everywhere.

1q63yvc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q63yvc,A nice tower,"I recently played SimTower again. Thanks to a lot of the good advice in this forum and elsewhere, I was able to make a SimTower tower that lives up to almost all of my childhood ambitions. It doesn't have the largest population or take up the most space or make the most profit, but it's symmetrical, is architecturally beautiful in an ""Empire State Building"" sort of way, and enables the happiest lives for the largest and most varied number of its residents without sacrificing anyone:

1. **Size**: its weekday population is about 19,200. Its weekend population is about 23,500.
2. **Rating**: the tower is often all blue, with all units simultaneously having the lovely blue ""excellent"" rating.
3. **Pricing**: the pricing is all the default ""average."" No lowering rents to boost ratings.
4. **Elevator placement**: all 24 elevators and 64 escalators are used. None are duplicative. Only one is ornamental.
5. **Elevator use**: people hardly ever get ""red"" waiting for an elevator. (After the Party Halls let out on floor 75 is the only occasional, regrettable exception.)
6. **Elevator use (more)**: the elevators all stop running by 1:00 a.m. or so, allowing a blissful few hours of quiet.
7. **Elevator cars**: all elevators have the ""Waiting Car Response"" option set to ""1"", so they all rush to wherever they're needed.
8. **Floor consistency**: all non-commercial floors have just one type of tenant: office, condominium, parking, etc.
9. **Section consistency**: all 15-story blocks of floors are devoted to just one type of non-commercial tenant:
   1. Basement: parking and commercial
   2. Floors 1-14: hotel suites
   3. Floors 15-29: double hotel rooms
   4. Floors 30-44: condominiums
   5. Floors 45-59: offices
   6. Floors 60-74: offices
   7. Floors 75-89: offices
   8. Floors 90+: condominiums
10. **Commercial placement**: commercial floors are clustered around lobbies, sky lobbies, and the basement.
11. **Commercial placement (more)**: shopping/dining is optimized for each block's local population:
   1. The floors immediately next to each lobby/skylobby are tailored for the residents of the 15-floor block above it, since apparently residents shop locally after at most one elevator ride and one stair/escalator trip, and the elevator ride must be down (not up).
      1. Condominiums get a mixture of retail, fast food, and restaurants.
      2. Offices prioritize fast food.
      3. Hotels prioritize restaurants.
   2. The first 128 shopping/dining establishments are on the floors directly above and below the lobbies, so the residents patronize the places in their block. (To learn more, see the 128 visitation limit links below.)
   3. ""Leftover"" establishments below the 128-visitation limit are clustered around floor 90, so the ""penthouse"" condominium residents have their choice of the finest shopping and dining.
12. **Medical center placement**: each block of offices or condominiums has its own pair of medical centers so no one has to travel far.
13. **Security placement**: each block has its own central security office.
14. **No empty space**: there's no empty floor space or padding.
15. **Escalator/elevator spacing**: no tenant complains they're far away from an elevator or escalator.
16. **Noise**: no tenant has noise complaints.
17. **Hotel suite excellence**: the finicky and demanding customers in the hotel suites almost always give a consistent blue ""excellent"" rating.
   1. They were never uniformly happy when they had to take express elevators, no matter how fast they moved. So now they're all below floor 15 and get direct elevator service to parking.
18. **Recycling center optimization**: the number of recycling centers is well-matched to the peak population (2,500 people served per center, 10 centers, and a peak population of \~23,500). There's never a ""Recycling Centers are full!"" notice.
19. **Parking**: the number of parking spots is well-matched to the usage from the hotel suites and offices (256 hotel suites, 256 office spaces, 304 parking spaces). There's never an ""Office workers demand Parking"" notice.
20. **Housekeeping**: housekeeping services almost always get done between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m., giving the housekeepers a few hours' well-earned rest.
21. **Starting money**: the tower started with the $2,000,000 opening, not the $4,000,000 opening.

And I'm also happy about some stylistic and artistic choices that let me imagine the residents having happy lives:

1. The tower has the classic art deco Empire State Building/Chrysler Tower shape: broad at the base and soaring to a spire.
2. The lobby is the magnificent 3-story lobby version.
3. All lobbies and skylobbies are placed so that the special eight-width statues/fountains/entrances appear on the left.
4. There's a grand escalator at the very center of the main lobby leading up to a matched pair of coffee shops.
5. Everything is symmetrical, except for the elevators (and they're mostly symmetrical): a tenant on the left side always has a matching tenant on the right side, etc.
   1. This includes the recycling centers, which are symmetrically placed in the basement on either side of the central metro station. Because recycling centers have to built contiguously, they needed a temporary ""bridge"" of recycling centers to get them to the other side. After construction, this bridge was demolished to make way for the metro station and shops.
6. There's a nice variety of eating and shopping establishments for each 15-story block of floors, especially with establishments in the 128-visitation limit. It doesn't change anything, but it's nice to think of the residents being able to choose between a burger, ice cream, soba, Chinese food, etc.
7. Shopping and dining establishments tend to be paired: a soba noodle fast food shop is next to its sushi restaurant sibling, a French restaurant tends to be next to a flower shop or coffee shop, etc.
8. All elevators are either evenly and symmetrically spaced or clustered as centrally as possible.
9. The top elevator is both aligned with the elevator above it and provides access to the cathedral in a discreet space off to the side, without requiring any empty floor space.
10. There's a security office directly above the metro station to keep an eye on all those potential troublemaking commuters and to serve as a central organizing hub for the other security offices.
11. The condominium people at the very top block are consistently the happiest, as people living in penthouses with the very best of views, dining, shopping, medicine, and security should be.
12. The tower is as placed as close to the center of the map as possible while still being constrained by the other criteria: the broad base, the symmetry of the overall tower, the special lobby part displaying in each lobby and sky lobby, just one type of tenant per floor, shopping/dining optimized per block, no empty floor space, and the hotel suite people being happy (which means 10-segment-wide hotel suites have to be on the first floors because of the short, direct elevator rides, so the base has to be a multiple of 10).

It's a good tower! I'm very grateful to the many good people and very good advice here. Particularly:

There are a few things I'm wondering how to support better:

1. Yellow ""good"" ratings appear sometimes. The ""double hotel room"" block sometimes has a couple. The ""hotel suite"" block has rarely has one. The ""lower condo"" block is predictably half-yellow, half-blue on the 1st weekday mornings. These yellow ratings gradually change to all blue as the week goes on, but they also appear no matter how many elevators or express elevators I support them with.
2. Sometimes there are red people waiting for elevators on the 75th floor, after the party halls get out. Even though they're outside people, I'd like them to be able to have a better experience visiting the tower.
3. It'd be nice to replace one of the blocks of condominiums with more hotels, but using more than one service elevator for housekeeping seems to reduce the number of housekeepers deployed to the lesser of housekeepers assigned from either one, crippling cleaning capability.
4. Anything else up for suggestion!

Anyway, thanks for being such a good community, for letting me be such a lurker, and for building such awesome towers!",14,1767755217.0,SimTower,1,1.0,False

I found this brand unintentionally; it seems like a new brand but it’s already been famous in Taiwan.I already tried the coffee, oat milk, vanila. And my fav is the oat milk.I was not really interested in it before until I found out its flavors are really cool. This is my first time trying oat milk flavor and it really taste like one! Added coffee, cereals, fruits even make it better! it would be blended well if I use the blending stick too, with shaking it’s also fine but need to drink it quickly. But the problem is the price, $49 with 2.2lb it’s a little pricey for me, but I think it’s also makes sense since it’s a foreign brand, About the protein amount, this one is 25g, but the number will be different if the flavor changes, the highest one is 28g (plant flavor). It’s also added vitamins and probiotics etc, all nutrition in one it is. I bought the plain flavor this time since it’s on sale, I would recommend this brand if you want to try soy protein!

Protein; 13g, Taste:3/5 Overall:4/5

This one it’s also well-known, so I am excited to try it. First, the taste it’s too sweet for me, I think it’s cuz the sweetener they choose, Im not really into this taste.. but the chocolate one is better! What’s good is, the price is very very good! I think it would be the cheapest of these three. It can help me to stay full and be a meal replacement. I think I would but it again if I’m out of budget.

1q63yk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q63yk0/was_my_idea_right/,Was my idea right?,"Every morning, Mrs. Calder left a mug on the low brick wall between the houses. “Too much coffee,” she’d say if anyone asked. “I can’t drink it all.” Mr. Henson would nod, thank her, and carry it inside. It became a habit, one of those quiet neighborly exchanges that don’t feel like much until they stop.
At first, he just felt tired. Then came the headaches, dull and constant, like weather moving through his skull. He blamed age, stress, the way the house never quite warmed up in winter. Mrs. Calder noticed everything. She asked if he was sleeping enough, if he was eating properly. Her concern felt practiced, smooth. The mugs kept coming.

Weeks passed. Mr. Henson began forgetting small things—where he left his keys, how long he’d been standing in a room. One afternoon, he spilled the coffee on the counter and saw a faint shimmer in the liquid before it soaked into the wood. He stared at the stain longer than necessary, unsettled, but said nothing. Confrontation had never been his strength.

When the ambulance finally came, Mrs. Calder stood on her porch with her hands folded, watching the doors close. Later that evening, she rinsed two mugs in the sink, dried them carefully, and placed only one back in the cupboard. The brick wall between the houses sat empty the next morning, catching the sun as if nothing had ever rested there at all. ",2,1767755192.0,stories,1,1.0,False

Rating: 7.5/10
""Honestly a solid piece for winter. I dig the reversible feature—the fleece side looks cozy, but the nylon side in this pic looks a bit deflated and wrinkly. Might need a steam or some wear to puff it up properly. The Coyote/Brown colorway is versatile, but the zipper hardware looks a little flimsy in the photo. Good daily driver, but nothing mind-blowing.""

2. The North Face Nuptse (Black)
**Rating: 8/10**
""You can't really go wrong with a black Nuptse, it’s a staple for a reason. That said, it is the 'NPC uniform' of winter. The puffiness here looks decent, not too flat. My main gripe with these is usually the collar shape—sometimes it sits weirdly against the neck. If the down fill is good, it’s a keep, but don't expect to stand out in a crowd.""

3. Ami Paris Big Heart Sweater
**Rating: 6/10**
""Unpopular opinion maybe, but the massive Ami de Coeur logo is getting a bit played out. It screams 'I bought this for the logo.' The grey knit looks clean and the stitching on the 'A' seems tight, but I’m worried about the wool quality. These tend to pill super fast or feel itchy if the material blend is cheap. Clean look, just a bit basic.""

4. Purple Brand Denim Jacket
**Rating: 5.5/10**
""This is... a lot. The paint splatter and distress effect feels a bit forced and artificial in this lighting. It gives off strong 2016 hypebeast vibes. If you style it with plain black pants it might work, but it’s a loud piece. The fit on Purple Brand is usually tight/fitted, so if you prefer the boxy/baggy trend, you might hate how this sits.""

5. Gallery Dept. Long Sleeve Tee
Rating: 7/10**
""Clean graphic. The 'Bar Dé Music' print is one of their better, more low-key designs. The blank looks decent, maybe a bit thin? The cuffs look like they might lose elasticity quickly. It’s a cool layering piece, but for what it is (literally a cotton long sleeve), it’s nothing crazy. Good for a chill fit.""

6. Acne Studios 'Mud Wash' / Chain Print Jeans
Rating: 9/10**
""Best item in the haul, hands down. The wash and the trompe-l'œil (optical illusion) chain print are sick. It fits that grimey/grunge aesthetic perfectly. My only concern is styling—these are hard to pull off without looking like you literally rolled in dirt. If you have the right boots and cropped top/hoodie, these are fire. If not, they just look messy.""

7. Velvet Track Jacket**
Rating: 7/10
""The velvet texture looks plush, definitely a comfy piece. It is huge right now, so the hype is there. However, black velvet is a lint magnet. You are going to be using a lint roller every time you leave the house. Also, the elastic banding at the hem looks a little loose/cheap. Good for a cozy UK drip vibe, but high maintenance.""

8. Off-White 'Out of Office' (OOO) Sneakers
Rating: 8.5/10**
""Super clean colorway. The white and grey is way more wearable than the loud colors Off-White usually does. The leather cuts look smooth and the shape is correct (chunky but not clown shoes). Just be warned, these are heavy on foot. If you plan on walking all day in these, your feet might get tired. Solid pickup.""

9. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Taupe)
Rating: 9.5/10**
""Certified classic. You literally cannot hate on these. The suede looks buttery and the color is perfect for neutral tones. They go with sweatpants, jeans, shorts, whatever. The only downside is keeping that suede clean—one drop of coffee or rain and it's game over. Make sure you spray them with protector immediately.""

10. Purple Brand Distressed Jeans (Black)
Rating: 5/10
""Meh. Similar to the jacket, the distressing here looks kinda cheap, specifically the checkered patches peeking through. It feels very 'mall fashion.' The skinny/stacked fit is also kind of dying out in favor of baggy denim. If you're going for a rockstar look, they work, but otherwise, I’d pass on these for something with a better wash.""

11. Fear of God Essentials 1/2 Zip Pullover (Nylon)
Rating: 7/10
""This is way better than their standard cotton hoodies that everyone and their grandma wears. The nylon gives it a nice technical/sporty vibe while keeping that signature boxy FOG silhouette. My only issue with these is the material noise—you literally sound like a walking bag of chips when you move. Also, the elastic on the waist looks really aggressive; expect it to ride up constantly if you don't layer it right.""

12. 'Lucky Me I See Ghosts' Hoodie (Kids See Ghosts)**
Rating: 6.5/10
""Ah, the holy grail of 2018 hypebeasts. Honestly, this piece feels a bit dated now. The puff print on the text looks decent—it’s got that 3D texture you want—but be careful washing it because that puff *will* crack and peel eventually. The wash on the grey fabric looks okay, maybe a bit too dark compared to retail, but it's hard to tell without natural light. Cool for the nostalgia, but a bit loud for 2026.""

13. Ralph Lauren Pony Socks (3-Pack)
Rating: 8/10
""Not much to say here, they are socks. You're paying for the little horse embroidery, let's be real. They are definitely cleaner than standard Nike socks for wearing with loafers or low-top sneakers like the OOOs or Birkenstocks you posted earlier. They tend to pill after a few washes though, so enjoy the crisp white look while it lasts. Solid essential.""

14. Ralph Lauren Cable Knit Sweater (Cream)**
Rating: 8.5/10
""This is the 'Old Money' starter pack final boss. It’s a super safe, versatile piece that makes you look put-together instantly. The cable knitting gives it good texture so it doesn't look cheap. It pairs perfectly with the fatigue pants or denim from your previous haul. Just make sure it’s not too thin; some of the newer RL knits feel flimsy. If the weight is good, this is a wardrobe staple.""

I thought maybe I was missing a piece when it arrived because I’ve never seen just one big hole (usually 2 or 3 small ones). Turns out this definitely is a thing and seems to be a fairly popular type of pour over. I’m just worried the brew won’t be strong enough because the coffee will go through too fast. I’m thinking maybe there’s a type of paper filter that is thicker and will slow the flow down a bit? The info in the box says it takes a conical V60 filter (or a basket filter?- that I’m not clear on). Would greatly appreciate recommendations on filter brands for a stronger brew (if possible with this type of pour over) or any info that is good to know when using this type of V60 dripper.

I’m 35, single, active, and have built a life I really enjoy. I work out, spend a lot of time outside, travel when I want, and I’m hoping to meet someone who’s in a similar place lifestyle-wise. I’m also 5’11, so height does matter to me (I know, I know, just being honest 🙈).

I’ve genuinely done the “do things you like and you’ll meet someone” advice. I’ve joined run clubs, sports leagues (tennis, pickleball), gone to meetups, and joined hobby groups I now attend regularly (love board games 🤓), and also specific dating events (those have been the least promising ironically). All of that has been great, I’ve made friends and built community, but I’ve never met a man I’m attracted to (either initially or over time) through any of these things.

The only times I notice men I’m attracted to are total drive-by situations: standing in line at a coffee shop, passing each other on Lady Bird Lake, etc. Obviously, in those moments I have no idea if they’re single (aside from married ones), and there’s also zero context for starting a conversation. Like… you don’t stop someone mid-run, right?

So I guess I’m wondering:
	•	For my fellow tall women who met their partner in Austin (especially if height and lifestyle compatibility mattered to you ) where did it actually happen?
	•	Is randomly approaching someone in places like coffee shops actually normal and successful, or does it mostly feel as awkward as I imagine it does? I’m assuming chasing someone down on the trail is just as creepy as it sounds.

This isn’t about having “high standards” so much as having specific ones that match who I am and the life I’ve already built.

A friend and I have half-jokingly talked about setting up a lemonade stand on the trail as a social experiment… but I figured I’d crowdsource here first to see if there are less cringey ideas 😅",0,1767754702.0,Austin,37,0.44,False
1q63q5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/freewill/comments/1q63q5u/agency_forensics_the_anatomy_of_a_simple_binary/,“Agency” Forensics: The Anatomy of a Simple Binary Choice,"Choice takes many forms, but all forms can be broken down into external, conscious and unconscious determinants that constrain them. 

When our actions are reflexive, they’re not based on conscious choice at all. They’re driven by unconscious determinants (biological, neural, conditioned) and constrained by external determinants (trigger/context). 

Some actions taken consciously also have no case for influence of a conscious or unconscious determinant. A coin flip is entirely subject to the external determinant of chance, and being subject to randomness is no kind of freedom. 

The simplest form of choice where all three determinant categories come into play is a simple binary selection. Let’s say our options at a very basic coffee shop are just black coffee or plain English breakfast tea, at the same cost per cup.

External determinants are already at play. Availability and costs. These determinants may give some people no choice based on taste, health restrictions, or finances. 

Unconscious determinants of choice include conditioning, the aforementioned personal taste and one’s current mood. These intersect with the constraints of the external determinants.

The potential override of the unconscious determinants is conscious reasoning. If agency is to be found anywhere, it is here. 

But what reasoning is there really in this simple binary case? 

If one already enjoys one of the options (or severely dislikes the other), then it may be conscious, but it’s not really *reasoning,* to say “well I’ll take what I prefer”. The preference is an unconscious determinant. 

If there is no strong like or dislike, that in itself is an unconscious determinant requiring reasoning. If reasoning is required within bounds of external determinants and to account for a lack of unconscious preference, then the act of reasoning is determined by these factors.

If you’re weighing recent choices (“I’ve had coffee the last few days”), your reasoning is supplied by habit or value, in turn shaped by unconscious or external (availability) determinants.

If you pick tea because you heard it’s healthier, your reasoning is based on conditioning by external sources.

If you seek agency by mastering and overriding all unconscious determinants, your reasoning - even from explicit intention and self-reflection - will still be based on external determinants, including your genetically defined capacity for thinking, the information you possess, and back to the limits in availability, cost constraints, etc. 

Compatibilism asserts that we have responsibility for the choice between coffee and tea in that our actions arise from what we ultimately tell ourselves are our motives for the choice. If I choose tea for health (based on prior learning and socialization to wellness concerns), the fact that I can explain the action with a motive assigns me responsibility. The *subjective feeling* of freely choosing is real (as a feeling), as we are the subjective locus of learning from prior acts (“doctor said my prior coffee choices are responsible for this health issue), simulate outcomes in this case, and arrive at a motive for our choice. 

However, since the origin of those motives is ultimately outside our control (availability, conditioning, biological health), compatibilist freedom is observing “agency within constraints,” not a *freedom from causation*. Deciding which motives to follow (“I prefer coffee” OR “I *should* have tea”, implies agency meaningful for ethics and self-understanding, given a typical biological capacity for reasoning. But this statement alone indicates that this agency - even in deciding between coffee or tea - is reliant on a causal chain of biology, personal history, and a lot of circumstance.",1,1767754580.0,freewill,8,1.0,False

Don't use onboard usb.  Get a good pci-e USB card that has a SATA power connecter.  Pulls the voltage issues away from the pci-e bus.

Go into device manager and show all hidden devices and uninstall all old pens.  Major flag here if you had an old Wacom tablet.

I was in a toxic relationship that slowly turned abusive. I felt trapped in a cycle where I’d try to leave, then get convinced to stay because I was told things would get better. They never did.

During that time, I asked my mom and my sister for help multiple times. At first, they said yes. But because I didn’t always follow through immediately (since I was still stuck in the abuse cycle), they now use that against me and say I “broke my promises.”

Eventually, I did leave for good. My mom lives about an hour and a half away, and my sister lives 20 minutes away. I moved in with my mom temporarily. My sister told me directly that I could move in with her on Tuesday.

What I later found out is that the entire time, my sister was telling my mom she didn’t want me to move in — while still telling me that I could. On Tuesday, the actual day she told me to come, she backed out.

This hurts even more because my sister and I already have a painful history. She’s stolen money from me in the past, was cruel to me growing up, borderline bullied me, and has often rejected me as a sister. I honestly thought that during something this serious, she would show up for me. She didn’t.

When I got upset about being rejected last minute, I was told I was selfish. My mom said I was “just like my dad,” that the world doesn’t revolve around me, and that because I put myself in this situation, I should get myself out of it. She also said that since help was offered before and I didn’t take it, no one wants to help me now.

That really broke me. I already feel like no one cares about what I go through, and this felt like confirmation of that. I was so hurt and angry that I threw my coffee at my mom’s door before leaving.

I know that wasn’t okay, but I was overwhelmed and felt completely abandoned.

Am I actually wrong here like my family says? Or is it reasonable to feel betrayed and hurt by this?",12,1767754337.0,amiwrong,7,0.88,False

1q63l1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/1q63l1j/i_recently_got_to_know_why_dating_is_not_working/,I Recently got to know why dating is not working.,"I'm a 29F looking for a serious kinda relationship that can be turned to marriage. I made my profile on hinge and I got a match from this guy who was okish and asked me out 3-4 times so I finally met him. When we met on coffee he didn't look very interested at that time then he asked me to come to his place, I was a bit hesitant since it was a first date but I finally took a plunge. Till this time I  was also not very attracted towards him. Then  he told me he is looking for serious relationship but he would get to know this if we spend quite a time and have some physical intimacy like kissing cuddling. ""Physical intimacy"" this is something that I as woman would like to go for at the last when I'm sure that he is the one. Else I don't want to feel used like a tissue paper. What if later he decides that I'm not the one made for him. So after that date we didn't go for another as according to him I'm not clear in my mind what I need. Now next I met another guy on hinge. He was decent looking and had a good bg. He told me he is also looking for a serious date to marry relationship. So I said let's meet or go for a walk on weekend and get to know eachother and this time I got a similar reply. He said ""I don't want to meet in public place where people pretend to be somebody else. Instead I want a home date where we can watch tv cook something together"". And we girls clearly know what it means when a guy is calling you to there home. Nd it becomes more difficult to say no when you are inside there territory. 

As a woman what I look for is the way you talk to me if I feel attracted towards you, if your sense of humor is good to decide if I would like to go further but for boys it's not the same.

I already had one casual relationship in past where I got really attached to that guy and later he said he doesn't want a serious relationship at this point of time. 
And maybe this is the reason I don't want to put myself there and say all the guys are same . 

Guys out there am I right about you? And do you all have the same dating pattern?

1q63ke1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q63ke1/loot_items_needed_for_expedition_load_stage_stage/,"Loot Items Needed for Expedition Load Stage (Stage 5), Loot Categorization (Loot Taxonomy)","I'm working on the second expedition, the one for early 2026. In it, you have to commit items from four categories:

1. Combat Items worth 200K coin
2. Survival Items worth 100K coin
3. Provision worth 150K coin
4. Materials worth 300K coin.

The categories show icons for the items, but what the game accepts for each category can be tricky.

For example, the provisions group has a nature icon. One would think it would accept all plants and seeds, but it does not. For example, it takes seeds, but does not take Great Mullein. (Maybe Mullein is under survival items? I've already finished that, so I cannot tell.)

So, I tried to create a table of what we'll need for the provisions category... and went down a rabbit hole.

What I've found is confusion around how Embark categorizes loot items. For example, look at [Advanced Electrical Components - ARC Raiders Wiki](https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Advanced_Electrical_Components). You'll see an image matching what you get from the in-game tool tip.

* It shows a wrench icon, which matches the stash category of crafting materials.
* It says the item is part of the ""Refined Material"" group.
* It says the item is rare.

So, for a loot categorization (taxonomy), we have at least three items:

1. Stash Category (Augments, Shields, Weapons, Ammo, etc.)
2. Loot Type ( Advanced Material, Basic Material, Key, Nature, etc.)
3. Rarity

There is also an axis needed for Spawn Location Types. These are shown on the maps, but aren't officially listed versus individual loot items.

Here is a table showing what I've found so far. Please provide comments and corrections and I'll update this post. This will let search engines and AI find correct data. Thanks!

I got refunded for the milk already, but I don’t want to waste it. I wanted to err on the side of caution in case it ‘goes bad’ by the time I finish my current carton. 

I still have half of my already-opened half-gallon left. I can eat cereals for breakfast in addition to the usual splash with my coffee in the mornings to try and power through the milk quicker. It usually takes me 1-2 weeks to finish a half-gallon if used for coffee only. 

Should I wrap the bottom in plastic wrap and try to keep it in the fridge anyways? Transfer it to a used plastic bottle (simply lemonade) and try to freeze it? I’m not sure I have freezer space lol.

1q63j8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1q63j8q/i_might_have_sibo_methane_new_here_please_help/,I might have SIBO methane? New here please help (symptoms for 6+years),"Hello, I'm looking for answers here because I've been on and off fighting my symptoms and conditions for more than 6 years now.  
It started small but over the years it has only turnout worse and I cant live a normal life now.  
  
2017 - had strong acid reflux with cofee and other foods (cut everything coffee, alchohol etc)  
2018 - had small lactose intolerance symptoms, bloating, excessive burping (cut milk, switched to yogurts, and avoided milk in general)  
also in 2018 had my 1st endoscopy that said everything was fine, no treatment, just some anti-acids. At the time I thought the bloating and burping was only due to the lactose intolerance and reflux.

From 2019 to 2022 the excess air, bloating, burping, acompained with fast beating heart and some chest pains, sometimes even sweating got progressevly worse. Now I have pain in esophagus and stomach, like pin needles and burning in the neck and chest.   
Some Doctors at the time said the heart racing was ansiety...  
Then in I changed doctor and did the 2nd endoscopy and 1st colonoscopy this time. Turns out I was diagnosed with both esophagy and gastritis.   
They also checked for H. Pylori because of my bloating and air complaints. But tested negative for H. Pylori, 2 times (breath test and endocopy sample).  
I have treated esophagy and gastritis both with Lanzoprazol mainly.  
  
But I still have the symptoms of bloating, excess burping, excess air in stomach, chest, (99% of air comes up instead of down), this gives me pain and heart racing (120bpm to 130bpm in the worst days)  
Sometimes I even wake up with a racing heart to then proceed to expels all the air burping, and when I have less air the heart resumes to close to normal.

Went to a new gastro, he said I was depressed and it was ansiety, gut brain axis etc. (they allways do it seems)

But finally I went to cardiologist, he said it was Roemheld Syndrome. The heart and the brain was not the problem. It is a dygestive issue that causes excess air, bloating, slow digestion.   
The air compresses the diafragm and muscles in the torax and cause the heart to beat fast. That and the slow digestion, the body tries hard to process the food for too long makes me feel weak and tired.

So now, I'm looking into SIBO, It was not H.Pylori, but some other bacteria is causing the fermentation and producing all this air and bloating.  


To give you an idea, I sometimes pass 1 day eating only 1 boiled egg, 1 boiled apple, and 1 cup of oatmeal hydrated with water. And im never hungry, on the contrary I'm allways full.

Before all this I was an atlhetic type, low weight but had good muscle, and I loved to eat, I used to eat everything and healthy too.  
But now, I avoid eating everyday, only do it because Im worried of getting weak and low nutrition.

Current symptoms are, I have a full hard belly everytime I eat, and I eat very little, I'm never hungry. Sometimes I wake up full of air in the stomach and chest, first thing i do i burp for 30min before even thinking about eating.  
I avoid all lactose, the intolerance has gotten worse, it makes me go straigth to the bathroom, but at least when it's the lactose I don't burp for 3hours straigth.

The worst symptoms I have right now are the excess air, speacially with the heart racing, and waking up with air and heart racing.  
The only thing I take is Semiticone (Aero-OM 125mg) for the air, I think it helps but it's not treating anything and doesnt act fast when i have a crisis... I also think I took Proton Inibitors (lanzoprazol) for too long that made the symptoms worse.

I think I have SIBO, the methane predominan, because it's the first time I find something that describes all the symptoms I have.  
I'm even surprised no doctor before mentioned this and allways think I'm just crazy or have ansiety.

I'm looking into which exams I can do to dignose this condition. Also I'm trying to understand the diet, it's not very straightforward.  
Over the years I've removed many things from my diet, trying and testing, but I allways have some symptom crisis and most of the time cant point to what caused it.

Sorry for the long post.

1q63ies,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q63ies,"Am I an NPC or a Hypebeast? A bit of both. | 10KG Haul Review: TNF, Ami, Purple Brand vs. Acne, RL, Birkenstock","1. Carhartt WIP Reversible Puffer Jacket**
Rating: 7.5/10
""Honestly a solid piece for winter. I dig the reversible feature—the fleece side looks cozy, but the nylon side in this pic looks a bit deflated and wrinkly. Might need a steam or some wear to puff it up properly. The Coyote/Brown colorway is versatile, but the zipper hardware looks a little flimsy in the photo. Good daily driver, but nothing mind-blowing.""

2. The North Face Nuptse (Black)
**Rating: 8/10**
""You can't really go wrong with a black Nuptse, it’s a staple for a reason. That said, it is the 'NPC uniform' of winter. The puffiness here looks decent, not too flat. My main gripe with these is usually the collar shape—sometimes it sits weirdly against the neck. If the down fill is good, it’s a keep, but don't expect to stand out in a crowd.""

3. Ami Paris Big Heart Sweater
**Rating: 6/10**
""Unpopular opinion maybe, but the massive Ami de Coeur logo is getting a bit played out. It screams 'I bought this for the logo.' The grey knit looks clean and the stitching on the 'A' seems tight, but I’m worried about the wool quality. These tend to pill super fast or feel itchy if the material blend is cheap. Clean look, just a bit basic.""

4. Purple Brand Denim Jacket
**Rating: 5.5/10**
""This is... a lot. The paint splatter and distress effect feels a bit forced and artificial in this lighting. It gives off strong 2016 hypebeast vibes. If you style it with plain black pants it might work, but it’s a loud piece. The fit on Purple Brand is usually tight/fitted, so if you prefer the boxy/baggy trend, you might hate how this sits.""

5. Gallery Dept. Long Sleeve Tee
Rating: 7/10**
""Clean graphic. The 'Bar Dé Music' print is one of their better, more low-key designs. The blank looks decent, maybe a bit thin? The cuffs look like they might lose elasticity quickly. It’s a cool layering piece, but for what it is (literally a cotton long sleeve), it’s nothing crazy. Good for a chill fit.""

6. Acne Studios 'Mud Wash' / Chain Print Jeans
Rating: 9/10**
""Best item in the haul, hands down. The wash and the trompe-l'œil (optical illusion) chain print are sick. It fits that grimey/grunge aesthetic perfectly. My only concern is styling—these are hard to pull off without looking like you literally rolled in dirt. If you have the right boots and cropped top/hoodie, these are fire. If not, they just look messy.""

7. Corteiz Velvet Track Jacket**
Rating: 7/10
""The velvet texture looks plush, definitely a comfy piece. Corteiz is huge right now, so the hype is there. However, black velvet is a lint magnet. You are going to be using a lint roller every time you leave the house. Also, the elastic banding at the hem looks a little loose/cheap. Good for a cozy UK drip vibe, but high maintenance.""

8. Off-White 'Out of Office' (OOO) Sneakers
Rating: 8.5/10**
""Super clean colorway. The white and grey is way more wearable than the loud colors Off-White usually does. The leather cuts look smooth and the shape is correct (chunky but not clown shoes). Just be warned, these are heavy on foot. If you plan on walking all day in these, your feet might get tired. Solid pickup.""

9. Birkenstock Boston Clogs (Taupe)
Rating: 9.5/10**
""Certified classic. You literally cannot hate on these. The suede looks buttery and the color is perfect for neutral tones. They go with sweatpants, jeans, shorts, whatever. The only downside is keeping that suede clean—one drop of coffee or rain and it's game over. Make sure you spray them with protector immediately.""

10. Purple Brand Distressed Jeans (Black)
Rating: 5/10
""Meh. Similar to the jacket, the distressing here looks kinda cheap, specifically the checkered patches peeking through. It feels very 'mall fashion.' The skinny/stacked fit is also kind of dying out in favor of baggy denim. If you're going for a rockstar look, they work, but otherwise, I’d pass on these for something with a better wash.""

11. Fear of God Essentials 1/2 Zip Pullover (Nylon)
Rating: 7/10
""This is way better than their standard cotton hoodies that everyone and their grandma wears. The nylon gives it a nice technical/sporty vibe while keeping that signature boxy FOG silhouette. My only issue with these is the material noise—you literally sound like a walking bag of chips when you move. Also, the elastic on the waist looks really aggressive; expect it to ride up constantly if you don't layer it right.""

12. 'Lucky Me I See Ghosts' Hoodie (Kids See Ghosts)**
Rating: 6.5/10
""Ah, the holy grail of 2018 hypebeasts. Honestly, this piece feels a bit dated now. The puff print on the text looks decent—it’s got that 3D texture you want—but be careful washing it because that puff *will* crack and peel eventually. The wash on the grey fabric looks okay, maybe a bit too dark compared to retail, but it's hard to tell without natural light. Cool for the nostalgia, but a bit loud for 2026.""

13. Ralph Lauren Pony Socks (3-Pack)
Rating: 8/10
""Not much to say here, they are socks. You're paying for the little horse embroidery, let's be real. They are definitely cleaner than standard Nike socks for wearing with loafers or low-top sneakers like the OOOs or Birkenstocks you posted earlier. They tend to pill after a few washes though, so enjoy the crisp white look while it lasts. Solid essential.""

14. Ralph Lauren Cable Knit Sweater (Cream)**
Rating: 8.5/10
""This is the 'Old Money' starter pack final boss. It’s a super safe, versatile piece that makes you look put-together instantly. The cable knitting gives it good texture so it doesn't look cheap. It pairs perfectly with the fatigue pants or denim from your previous haul. Just make sure it’s not too thin; some of the newer RL knits feel flimsy. If the weight is good, this is a wardrobe staple.""

Hey everyone. Today, tonight, tomorrow, whenever you watch this, the 100th episode. The title card sums it up well..I can't believe we are still going!



Episode title- Climb That Hill



Title card- welcome to THE 100TH EPISODE OF - Wait, seriously? A hundred? This can't be right. No, it is. Seriously, we checked. This is the 100TH EPISODE OF Cougar Town.

  


Jules' asks about pacifier in wine. Grayson has a new movie mash up, Dirty Harry Potter and the phrase nip it in the bud is changed  to nip it in the butt.



The conversation turns to coffee preferences. Ellie says Grayson is a bad listener and quizzes him. 



Stan's school has sent an email about Stan's hands being down his pants a lot. Everyone agrees it is learned from Andy.



Everyone tells Jules she has to read a book. 



Grayson tells Ellie he wants her to be his listening teacher. 



Tom suggests some animalistic reinforcements to stop Andy putting his hands down his pants.



Jules keeps failing to read the book. Laurie mentions the movie.



Ellie sends Grayson in to listen to Travis.



Andy gets urges to put his hands down his pants. Ellie busts him.



Jules sits down to watch the DVD. Grayson walks in. He goes upstairs. Jules watches the movie, only to see Laurie and Grayson on the TV and they tell her to read the book.



Jules babysits Bobby and begins reading again.



Travis gives Andy some advice.



Grayson has a new song filled with facts about everyone. Travis' face gets touched with Andy germs.
