All the locals and shop owner were amazing and extremely friendly which kinda hard to find these days in a tourist heavy city. So I really appreciate the hospitality from the people of Strasbourg. 

Felt like the city is heaven for someone who likes fresh bakery food, although took time for us to find croissant as most places it was already sold out so gave up and visited a cafe the cafe owner suggested another bakery where we got the croissant and came back to cafe to enjoy the coffee and hot chocolate. It was good to see local shops supporting each other instead of just competing.

It was great experience there, you all have a beautiful city and even beautiful people.

I have a strong background in design and art, so I have that side of things covered. However, I'm currently on the lookout for cost-effective yet diverse sources for photos, sounds, and videos.

Previously, I've used Envato, which offers a broad selection. However, I've found their offerings lacking in specific areas, such as:

* **Staged crime scenes**: Engaging and atmospheric images to set the tone.
* **Normal indoor and outdoor shots**: Like pictures you would expect to see from security cameras or casual photo-takers.
* **Item photography**: Well-taken shots of objects like a key on a desk for example or an overturned coffee cup on some printouts, that sort of thing.
* **Candid character shots**: Photos of models doing normal activities, or at least not posing for the camera.

Additionally, I'm searching for an affordable way to host a website featuring several ""unique"" URLs for fake websites, password-protected (but not actually secure) puzzle solutions, and similar elements.

If anyone has recommendations or experiences with resources that fit these needs, I would greatly appreciate your insights!

My SO (43F) gave me some hints on what she wanted for mother's day. I got most of what she wanted, which cost about $300 overall. 

We had one activity for our daughter in the morning that I said I'd bring her to so she can rest. I asked her a few times what she wanted to do on Mother's Day, she said that she didn't have anything in mind. 

I took our daughter to the activity the morning of Mother's Day and call her on her way home asking what she'd like to do the rest of the day. She said she didn't know. I said maybe we can talk about it when we get home. When we got home, she was cleaning and then had to take my SS out and we had another chore to take care of. I asked a few more times what she wanted to do, nothing. Made a suggestion to a coffee place she liked, said it may be busy. 

Then before we go to do the chore, she gets mad at me saying that I didn't have a plan, and it was now after 12 and we're just going to sit around all day while I had nothing planned. I don't understand this as I asked her several times asking what to do, but her problem was that it's always up to her what to do and how I could've planned something for her to show her appreciation. How she'd rather not have the gifts (which she liked) but would've liked for me to plan something instead. 

She then went on to say how she's more of the man of the house and wears the pants in our relationship, which was very hurtful. 

Am I in the wrong here?

1kkcoqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/1kkcoqi/feedback_request_flow_redirection_model/,Feedback Request. Flow Redirection Model:,"Hi everyone,

I've developed what I believe is a novel framework for organizational change called the Flow Redirection Model, and I'd appreciate your expert feedback before I publish it more formally.

The Flow Redirection Model

A Systems Approach to Strategic Change

Core Concept

The Flow Redirection Model enables change in complex systems by identifying and modifying key pressure points‚Äîstrategic nodes where targeted interventions can naturally redirect existing flows toward desired outcomes with minimal resistance. Instead of comprehensive restructuring or direct confrontation, this approach works with a system‚Äôs natural dynamics through accessible high-leverage points.

The Role of Leadership:

In the Flow Redirection Model, leadership is evaluated as a potential pressure point. Whether leadership acts as a facilitator or an obstacle depends entirely on its alignment with system flows and desired outcomes. When leadership supports the change, it becomes a critical amplifier. However, when leadership resists or obstructs change, the model strategically circumnavigates it by leveraging alternative flows or more accessible points of influence. This pragmatic approach reflects the reality that leadership is not inherently positive or negative but context-dependent.

‚∏ª

Key Principles

1. Pressure Point Identification

Locate system nodes where:
‚úì Flows naturally converge/diverge
‚úì Small changes create disproportionate impact
‚úì Intervention costs are low relative to potential gains
‚úì System dynamics can be harnessed (not resisted)

Requires understanding both formal structures and informal flow patterns.

2. Accessibility Assessment

Evaluate intervention points by:
	‚Ä¢	Available resources
	‚Ä¢	Anticipated resistance levels
	‚Ä¢	Existing momentum to leverage
	‚Ä¢	Timing/windows of opportunity
	‚Ä¢	Structural/institutional barriers

Prioritizes high-accessibility points to conserve resources.

3. Minimal Intervention Design

Design smallest sufficient modifications that:
‚úì Work with (not against) system dynamics
‚úì Make surgical (not sweeping) changes
‚úì Utilize natural amplification mechanisms
‚úì Avoid triggering system backlash
‚úì Preserve functional elements

Goal: Maximum impact with minimum disruption.

4. Iterative Observation

Post-intervention monitoring tracks:
	‚Ä¢	Immediate/delayed effects
	‚Ä¢	Unexpected consequences
	‚Ä¢	Flow pattern changes
	‚Ä¢	New pressure points emerging
	‚Ä¢	Resistance mechanisms developing

Accepts system unpredictability while gathering crucial data.

5. Adaptive Refinement

Cyclical adjustments based on observations:
	‚Ä¢	Modify ineffective interventions
	‚Ä¢	Amplify successful approaches
	‚Ä¢	Shift to newly accessible points
	‚Ä¢	Adjust timing/intensity
	‚Ä¢	Develop resistance countermeasures

Maintains dynamic responsiveness.

6. Flow Acceleration

Builds momentum by:
	‚Ä¢	Leveraging early wins for resources
	‚Ä¢	Strengthening positive feedback loops
	‚Ä¢	Growing supporter coalitions
	‚Ä¢	Accessing previously blocked points
	‚Ä¢	Creating self-sustaining flows

Makes subsequent changes progressively easier.

7. Strategic Circumnavigation

When facing strong resistance (including leadership resistance):
‚úì Identify alternative pathways
‚úì Bypass (don‚Äôt confront) power centers when they act as bottlenecks
‚úì Create parallel structures or informal coalitions
‚úì Work around leadership when it actively resists change
‚úì Conserve resources for more accessible points of influence
‚úì Leverage leadership when it aligns naturally with the desired flow

Practical approach to power realities.

‚∏ª

Methodological Process

A 10-phase cycle:
	1.	System Mapping - Document current flows/feedback loops
	2.	Pressure Point Analysis - Identify all potential leverage nodes
	3.	Accessibility Evaluation - Assess realistic intervention points
	4.	Intervention Design - Create tailored minimal changes
	5.	Strategic Implementation - Execute with timing awareness
	6.	Systematic Observation - Monitor multidimensional responses
	7.	Adaptive Adjustment - Refine based on results
	8.	Flow Cultivation - Strengthen beneficial dynamics
	9.	Reassessment - Identify new access opportunities
	10.	Iterative Application - Repeat with refined understanding

‚∏ª

Practical Applications

Effective for:
	‚Ä¢	Organizational Change - Culture/process transformation
	‚Ä¢	Public Policy - Surgical interventions with political viability
	‚Ä¢	Community Development - Organic improvement catalysis
	‚Ä¢	Environmental Sustainability - Resource flow redirection
	‚Ä¢	Social Movements - High-leverage advocacy targeting

‚∏ª

Theoretical Foundations

Integrates concepts from:
	‚Ä¢	Systems Theory (interconnections/feedback)
	‚Ä¢	Network Theory (flow patterns/node importance)
	‚Ä¢	Game Theory (response anticipation)
	‚Ä¢	Path Dependency Theory (initial condition effects)
	‚Ä¢	Complexity Science (emergence/non-linearity)

‚∏ª

Structured Methodology: The PIER Process

Pre-step: Change Readiness Assessment
	‚Ä¢	Evaluate leadership willingness
	‚Ä¢	Identify cultural/structural barriers
	‚Ä¢	Assess if resistance itself needs addressing

1. Problem Definition
	‚Ä¢	Clarify desired outcome
	‚Ä¢	Set success metrics
	‚Ä¢	Establish system boundaries

2. Pressure Point Identification
	‚Ä¢	Catalog all opposing factors
	‚Ä¢	Include obvious and subtle influences
	‚Ä¢	Consider multiple levels (individual to environmental)

3. Evaluation Matrix

Rank points by:
‚úì Impact (on desired outcome)
‚úì Accessibility (ease of modification)

Quadrant Prioritization:
	1.	High Impact/High Access - Immediate action
	2.	Low Impact/High Access - Quick wins
	3.	High Impact/Low Access - Long-term strategy
	4.	Low Impact/Low Access - Deprioritize

4. Implementation & Monitoring
	‚Ä¢	Target high-accessibility points first
	‚Ä¢	Document flow pattern changes
	‚Ä¢	Reassess matrix periodically

5. Repetition & Refinement
	‚Ä¢	Update pressure point rankings
	‚Ä¢	Identify new access opportunities
	‚Ä¢	Adjust strategies based on results

‚∏ª

Distinctive Value

Compared to traditional approaches, FRM offers:
‚úì Greater efficiency (impact/resources ratio)
‚úì Enhanced sustainability (self-reinforcing changes)
‚úì Improved adaptability (dynamic response)
‚úì Practical pragmatism (works with system realities)
‚úì Increased resilience (distributed intervention points)
‚úì Broader accessibility (works with limited resources)

This model enables sustainable transformation by strategically redirecting existing flows rather than forcing artificial change.

Defining Pressure Points

Pressure points are specific factors within a system that create resistance against desired outcomes. They represent nodes where tension, blockage, or impedance occurs, preventing a system from naturally moving toward its optimal state. Their strategic value in the Flow Redirection Model depends on both their influence on flows and their accessibility for modification with available resources.

Key Characteristics of Pressure Points:

1. Flow Impact: Directly influence how resources, information, decisions, or energy move through a system, creating bottlenecks or diversions.

2. Scale Spectrum: Range from seemingly ""minor"" factors (broken coffee machines, inadequate parking) to major organizational structures and policies‚Äîboth ends can significantly impact system flows.

3. Measurable Effect: Influence on desired outcomes can be observed, measured, or reasonably estimated.

4. System Location: Exist at any level‚Äîfrom individual behaviors to organizational structures to environmental conditions.

5. Relational Nature: Often emerge at the intersection of different system components or stakeholder relationships.

6. Visibility Spectrum: Range from obvious and acknowledged to subtle and hidden‚Äîwith some of the most powerful being those least visible to leadership.

Types of Pressure Points:

1. Structural: Formal systems, policies, procedures, or physical arrangements (approval processes, office layouts, reporting structures).

2. Process: Inefficiencies, redundancies, or gaps in how work is performed (handoffs, communication bottlenecks, workflow issues).

3. Cultural: Unwritten rules, norms, and shared beliefs that constrain behavior (risk aversion, blame culture, unspoken hierarchies).

4. Resource: Limitations in time, money, skills, or materials that impede progress (budget constraints, talent gaps, tool limitations).

5. Power: Formal and informal authority structures that can block or enable change (key decision-makers, informal leaders, gatekeepers).

6. Personal: Individual behaviors, preferences, fears, or motivations affecting system flows (management styles, resistance patterns).

7. Environmental: External factors constraining or influencing the system (regulatory requirements, market conditions, competitive pressures).

8. Experience: Daily frictions affecting engagement and motivation (workspace comfort, equipment functionality, amenities, commute factors).

 Distinguishing Features:

The Flow Redirection Model uniquely evaluates pressure points on both impact and accessibility, recognizing that high-impact points may be inaccessible while readily modified points may have moderate effects. This approach transcends simple problem identification by acknowledging pressure points exist within dynamic systems with interconnected flows, where changing one point may trigger cascading effects throughout the system.

In practical terms, pressure points represent strategic leverage points where targeted interventions can redirect existing flows toward desired outcomes with minimal resource expenditure.

Why ""Small"" Pressure Points Matter:

1. Cumulative Impact: Individual factors may seem minor but collectively create significant resistance.

2. Emotional Response: Generate reactions affecting engagement, motivation, and discretionary effort.

3. Symbolic Value: Carry weight regarding how much leadership values employee experience.

4. Visibility Gap: Reflect disconnect between leadership perception and actual experience drivers.

5. Accessibility Advantage: Often highly accessible for intervention, making them ideal starting points for building momentum toward larger changes.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

Core Concept:
The Flow Redirection Model enables change in complex systems by identifying and modifying key pressure points where targeted interventions can naturally redirect existing flows toward desired outcomes with minimal resistance. Rather than comprehensive restructuring, it focuses on accessible high-leverage points.

Key Innovations:
1.Impact/Accessibility Matrix: Evaluates potential intervention points based not just on their impact but also on their accessibility with available resources
2. Pressure Point Identification: Systematic approach to finding where flows are impeded, including often-overlooked ""small"" factors
3. Strategic Circumnavigation: Working around resistance (including leadership) rather than directly confronting it
4. Minimal Intervention Design: Creating the smallest changes necessary to redirect flows

Practical Application:
The PIER Process (Problem ‚Üí Identification ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Redirection ‚Üí Repeat) provides a structured methodology that prioritizes interventions based on both impact and accessibility.

Questions for the Community:
1. Does this approach seem novel compared to existing change models you're familiar with?
2. What aspects seem most potentially valuable in real-world applications?
3. What's missing or unclear that would make this more useful?
4. What frameworks does this most remind you of, and how is it different?

I'm not looking to sell anything - just seeking honest feedback from experienced practitioners before I publish this more formally. Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

Im so angry honestly.

My first two mother's Days was pure BLISS.Im talking breakfast in bed, gifts,lunch,being waited on hand and foot.But this year.......urgggggggg!!!!!

I told him I'd like a seafood boil(he is an excellent cook) and a card with our daughter's feet/hands.So he KNEW and had ample time to sort it......but no.He woke up this morning with our 3yr old,gave her breakfast etc.Meanwhile I'm laying in bed waiting for ATLEAST a coffee or cereal.....NADA..Gift?NADA.Card?NADA.I ended up getting up and making my own damn coffee.

I immediately called him out and asked what's this????He then brings our toddler to me and says""say happy mother's day to mommy""oh and happy mother's Day from me too.

MY BLOOD BOILED.

He complained he didn't have money to do anything,like excuse me???? a card costs so little,even if you our daughter out her hands/feet on a piece of painted CARBOARD I'd have been happy,our daughter has craft paint,it's NOT rocket science!!!He KNOWS I prefer sentimental gifts.

We HAD seafood in our freezer and I bought extra prawns in the week just for the seafood boil.He made the food after I confronted him,it was delicious but I was so ANGRY that I couldn't even finish my plate

Meanwhile I already ordered him custom gifts for father's worth almost 1k!!!which will arrive in 1 weeks time.

1)A custom PS4 controller of his favourite soccer team

2) Custom PS4 thumb grips of his favourite soccer team to match the controller 

3)A new gaming headset 

4)A pair of slides aka slippers(name branded)

I did it cause he has been a wonderful husband and dad and I felt he deserves it and didn't give me any reason to think otherwise,I've saved for MONTHS so why couldn't he??or did he just THINK I'd accept this behaviour?

Safe to say all that shit I will be returning if I can or I'll sell it 

Cause fuck that shit.

I mean even if he was tight on cash there are things you can do that doesn't cost a fortuneüôÑüôÑ

I told him to not talk to me till I calm down or I'll end up saying something that I'll regret.

Im STILL so ANGRY.

It's 00:02am,we need to be up for work at 5am but I just cannot sleep cause this was SHOCKING to say the least!

Hey everyone üëã I never thought I‚Äôd be the person writing this, but here we are. I wanted to share something super personal and maybe a little weird: how I went from rolling my eyes at anything psychic-related to actually *booking regular online readings* like it‚Äôs part of my self-care routine üòÖ. I know how this sounds, trust me. I used to be one of those people who thought psychics were just modern-day scam artists selling dreams. But something changed... and if you‚Äôre curious or on the fence about trying a reading, maybe my story will help. Or at least entertain you for a bit lol.

So yeah. Let me start from the top. A few years ago, I was going through a *super rough patch*‚Äîrelationship drama, career confusion, weird health stuff, and I just felt stuck in a loop I couldn‚Äôt get out of. Therapy helped, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm all about therapy üíØ. But I needed something that would help me process things from a different angle‚Äîsomething a little more spiritual but not full-blown religion.

One night (probably around 2am if I‚Äôm honest üòÇ), I was scrolling Reddit and saw a post on this very subreddit talking about a tarot reader who ""totally changed my life."" I rolled my eyes so hard I almost saw the back of my brain üòµ. But... I clicked. And I read. And then I read the comments. Then I started browsing the subreddit more.

People were sharing these super detailed readings‚Äîstuff that felt too personal or accurate to be random. I saw posts about love readings, career decisions, and even past life stuff üëÅÔ∏è. I felt like I‚Äôd stumbled into a secret club I never knew existed. Still skeptical but very curious, I thought: okay, why not try *one* reading just for fun?

I found a reader offering $10 mini tarot pulls and figured, whatever, that‚Äôs less than coffee. I sent in a vague question, didn‚Äôt give any personal info, and waited. The response blew. my. mind. ü§Ø

It wasn‚Äôt just general ""you‚Äôre going through changes"" fluff. The reader mentioned something very specific about a guy I hadn‚Äôt talked to in months but was constantly thinking about. They described his behavior, what went wrong, and what could still happen. It wasn‚Äôt sugarcoated either, but it felt *real*. Like someone finally understood the situation better than even my closest friends did.

That reading messed me up a little. In a good way. So I tried another. And then another. üòÖ Eventually, I found a couple of readers who I connected with deeply‚Äîlike they spoke a language I didn‚Äôt know I needed.

To be clear, not every reading I‚Äôve gotten has been accurate. Some have felt off, vague, or even copy-paste-y. But others? Others have literally changed how I make decisions. I‚Äôve had readings that predicted people reappearing in my life (which they did), opportunities coming up in my work (again, yes), and even emotional patterns I hadn‚Äôt faced yet.

One reading literally told me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not stuck‚Äîyou‚Äôre afraid of choosing.‚Äù üò≠ That line lived rent-free in my head for WEEKS. It actually helped me stop avoiding a really big move I‚Äôd been afraid to make.

Also, something I didn‚Äôt expect: these readings made me more *introspective*. I started journaling more, paying attention to signs in my day-to-day life, and trusting my gut. I didn‚Äôt suddenly become a witch in the woods or anything üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but I felt... connected. Like there was meaning again.

Over time, I started learning a little tarot myself. Just pulling a card in the morning with my coffee ‚òï and asking, ‚ÄúWhat do I need to know today?‚Äù became a ritual that helped me feel more grounded.

There‚Äôs still a part of me that‚Äôs logical and skeptical. And I think that‚Äôs healthy. I don‚Äôt rely on psychics to make all my choices. But I *do* lean on them for insight, clarity, or just a comforting voice when things feel confusing.

The truth is, online psychic readings helped me more than I ever expected. They gave me a new perspective, reminded me to trust my intuition, and helped me make peace with situations I couldn‚Äôt control.

Now, whenever someone says, ‚ÄúBut do you really *believe* in that stuff?‚Äù my answer is... kinda complicated. I believe in energy. I believe in intuition. I believe that sometimes we need mirrors to show us what we already know deep down. And I believe that the right reader, at the right moment, can truly say something that sticks with you forever.

So yeah, if you‚Äôre sitting there wondering whether or not to try a reading... I say go for it. Start small. Keep your expectations realistic. But be open. Because honestly? Sometimes magic shows up in unexpected ways.

I'm looking to lateral to larger/more well-regarded firms, while staying in the same niche. 

Obviously hiring for laterals at the EM level is pretty uncommon right now, and so rather than just go through the application process (if they even have EM applications open right now), I'm planning on reaching out to the partners who work in this niche. And this niche is very, very niche-y; only my boutique and one other boutique actually have a dedicated practice for it, while the bigger firms just lump it in under a bigger industry niche, even though it's pretty differentiated. I'm hoping I can potentially bring over some clients and help build it into more of a stand-alone area. 

I'm trying to figure out what's the right way to go about this. If I reach out on LinkedIn, should I just level with them in my opener that I'm trying to suss out if they have any interest in hiring an EM in this area?

I moved from a 1 bedroom apartment into a share house with a family. 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom and a media room. 

The bedrooms are taken up by my housemates and their family while I have the media room as my bed room. I have no built in cupboards and not enough room in my room for another storage space/cupboard. I have 2 sets of 4 drawers and one rack to hang clothes on with coat hangers. 

Due to moving from a one bedroom apartment to a room, I‚Äôve had to downsize massively and store as much as I can into my bedroom. In the kitchen, I have 2 cupboards with 2 shelves each cupboard for all of my utensils, food, food storage etc and my own fridge. 

I share a living space with them that they have taken over with their belongings (I have a TV and Xbox in the living room, and a coffee table). Share a bathroom with 3 other people in the house, and share a toilet with the other 5 people in the house. I also pay nearly 1/3 of the rent and over 1/3 of the bills, even though there is 5 of them in their family.

I work 11-12 hour days at work, 6 days a week and have been doing so for the past few months. My daily schedule at this point is work, eat and sleep. I also spend 2-3 nights a week at my partners house.

On multiple occasions, my housemates have gone into my room without my permission. This has happened on multiple occasions, and they always have a ‚Äúreason‚Äù for doing so, even though I‚Äôve raised it with them that it is my only PRIVATE space in the entire house. These reasons usually include giving me my packages and putting my clean clothes on my bed. Yesterday I received a long winded message about cleaning my room or find somewhere else to live. 

Now‚Ä¶ The only things on my floor are groceries (not fresh, all tinned and packaged up) and clothes. All because I don‚Äôt have storage in the kitchen for myself to use, or anywhere to put my clean clothes other than the floor or on the drawers. I think I have one open packet of chips in there and an open chocolate bar, which is all sealed up. 

Daily I come home from work, and the kitchen is an absolute disaster. I end up cleaning it up after work while I‚Äôm making dinner while 5 of them are all sitting on the couch watching TV or in their room after school, or also getting home from work around that time going to have showers. 

I have raised this issue before about having no storage space in the kitchen, my bedroom and in the shared lounge room. I am constantly having to watch the food in my fridge and cupboard as it consistently goes missing and I know I‚Äôm not the one using it. I stocked up on toilet paper and bought 48 rolls (as my toilet is the shared one and I was going away so I wanted to make sure they had enough), a pack of 24 disappeared when I got home from work one day. All of my camping equipment in the garage also goes walkabouts regularly, to the point I have to store it at my partners house. 

They also have cameras in the main living areas that is claimed to be for their pets. These pets have destroyed the floors in the dining room from peeing inside etc as well. 

The other 3 people I share a bathroom with, also trash the second lounge room they have daily and also don‚Äôt contribute to cleaning the bathroom or communal toilet. 

I am cleaning my room today as I have a day off work today and that was always my plan to clean it and wash my car etc. 

I still have just over 6 months on the lease with them. What do you think I should do? 

Ps. I am moving out at the end of this lease and have had that plan for months. I‚Äôm currently looking at my options of breaking lease and what my rights are as far doing that goes.

Each store has its own custom logo, font, and design, instead of the standard white store sign with Comic Sans writing, every billboard being a coloured icon with a name underneath, being able to actually create a ""public image"" for my companies is amazing.

however, the actual process of doing this, editing your savegame folder, finding the business name, entering the folder, loading each and every icon into [paint.net](http://paint.net), editing all three templates individually, saving all three templates individually and then repeating for the 80+ businesses you own ingame is huge time sink and extremely tedious.

Are there any plans to streamline this process? An in-game editor for the billboards and shop signs? More standard layouts for the signs? choices of art, pictures, colours and styles?

For example, looking at the coffee shop in midtown ""central perk"" (a friends reference) the signage for the store is exactly like the one in friends, it looks amazing, but if you buy out the store, it switches to an ugly, standard white sign with the name written in a standard font, there is no way to keep the custom signage or logos. Is this planned to change? Or are we doomed to spending hours on Google, finding images to piece together to make our custom signs and then spending half a day importing them into the save folders?

I do love having the option, and those of us with amazing creativity and design skills will be able to make some real masterpieces, but as someone like me, with zero skill and knowledge, will we be getting anything to help achieve this in-game without learning how to be a pro Photoshop editor?

added a few examples of the signage some of my stores have, instead of the standard pixel art one colour signs we currently have.

However, we were always flirting with each other so it was never just a friendship. Anyways, at the time one of my friends really liked her, but he was just not making a move on her, so I told him one Friday ""I'll give you the weekend, if you're not going to ask her out I will"". Fast-forward to Monday and she and I were having sex. Now this lasted for a couple of months (we were never in a formal relationship mainly because I was going through a lot and I didn't want to), until we just stopped and I later found out she got into a relationship with someone else. I was fine with this and we kept being good friends although we didn't see each other as often anymore. Next semester we shared a lecture and we started to become closer again and we started to flirt again. I knew she was still in a relationship, but things were not going too well, she started talking about breaking with her boyfriend and being with, I just said it was her decision. Then, the pandemics started and I was depressed for a while so I disappeared but then again we started chatting everyday and just talking a lot during the whole lockdown. Towards the end of lockdown we both started working at a hospital (different hospitals but next to each other) so we would met very often and sit in her car or my car to talk, then it wasn't just talk. I knew she was still in a relationship, but I didn't care, I just loved her. When we returned to classes we started seeing each other more often and pretty much everyone in the bachelor programme knew what was going on, but kept quiet. At the end of our bachelor we planned a prom trip to the beach and her parents were going to a town nearby so they were driving her and they offered to take me as well (they absolutely loved me, but didn't know what was going on) to which I accepted. The moment we arrived she got a text from her boyfriend breaking up with her because he found out about me and the trip was pretty much spoiled because she was sad the whole time. When we came back we talked and we kept seeing each other, but I could see she wasn't fully comfortable. Many things happened during that time, one of which is she kissed with s mutual friend whom I have talked with about her and how much I liked her. One day we were having coffee and we talked about everything and we decided that we would keep being friends and that we should tell each other if we wanted to date someone, then she started getting calls from her ex boyfriend and the next day I was blocked from her contacts, so I sent her a DM through IG asking her for some of my stuff and just to give them to another friend as I didn't want to see her and I knew she had gone back to her ex. That year was very tough for me for many reasons, including that, so I applied for a scholarship and decided to start a masters in another country and for my first year I was doing fine and barely thinking about her, I dated many girls during that time, but it was never the same. One day, I got a text from her telling me she missed me, I replied and told her I missed her too. We talked and decided to be friends again and we would again talk almost everyday. Last December I went back to my hometown for the holidays and we went out for dinner, everything felt like before and once again we ended kissing in my car. I came back to my studies and we kept talking and everytime she would tell me how much she loves me and misses me and how she's planning to visit me in June. Two weeks ago I saw a picture of her kissing some dude and it broke my heart. I told her that I didn't want to be a part of this again and to never contact me again and this time I blocked her from every way she has of contact me, I didn't even wait for her reply, I just blocked her.

I 22M started using chewing tobacco daily when I was 14 because when you're working on a farm or playing baseball it was the cool thing to do. Little did I know at the time is that this chemical would control my life for years. 

About 3 years ago I wanted to quit rubbing snuff so I made the switch to ZYN's. At the beginning they were the shit. I could throw one or two in and nobody around me could tell that I was addicted to the nic. I had one in Going to the grocery store, going to church, work, basically I had one in 24/7 minus eating and sleeping. 

For financial reasons I quit last year for 7 months. At the time I didn't even realize it, but I felt the best I had ever felt for a long time. Then how it usually goes I started to go out drinking again with buddies because it was summer time and I was enjoying life. Nicotine enters the picture again but this time it has some serious ramifications. 

I had only been using for 3 months whenever the anxiety and depression took me over. It was like a switch had been flipped over night, I went from a super confident out going dude, to a shell of my former self. I couldn't hold a conversation, couldn't sleep, completely lost my appetite, libido gone, found no joy in just about anything. 

Also my physical health has taken a hit. I am a avid lifter/runner as well as I work on power lines for a living so I am constantly moving. Literally walking up a hill would gas me so hard I would have to take 5 which is very unusual for me. 

Flash forward to now and I've basically been dealing with this everyday since then. Then I remembered that none of this had been present whenever I wasn't using nicotine and limited caffeine to like a coffee a day.

So today is the start, and I feel like an absolute piece of shit. My head is pounding, I am super spacey, can't concentrate, and have zero motivation to do a thing. But I woke up ate breakfast, mowed and weedeated, ate lunch and typed out this message. I hate this chemical and what it has taken away from me in life.  

Tl;dr: I started using nicotine 8 years ago, quit last year for 7 months and felt great. Started using again then 3 months later started having very bad anxiety and depression out of nowhere. Been dealing with that for 7-8 months so now I'm quitting nicotine and limiting caffeine hoping it has something to do with it.

1kkccv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1kkccv7/feedback_request_flow_redirection_model/,Feedback Request. Flow Redirection Model:,"Hi everyone,

I've developed what I believe is a novel framework for organizational change called the Flow Redirection Model, and I'd appreciate your expert feedback before I publish it more formally.

The Flow Redirection Model

A Systems Approach to Strategic Change

Core Concept

The Flow Redirection Model enables change in complex systems by identifying and modifying key pressure points‚Äîstrategic nodes where targeted interventions can naturally redirect existing flows toward desired outcomes with minimal resistance. Instead of comprehensive restructuring or direct confrontation, this approach works with a system‚Äôs natural dynamics through accessible high-leverage points.

The Role of Leadership:

In the Flow Redirection Model, leadership is evaluated as a potential pressure point. Whether leadership acts as a facilitator or an obstacle depends entirely on its alignment with system flows and desired outcomes. When leadership supports the change, it becomes a critical amplifier. However, when leadership resists or obstructs change, the model strategically circumnavigates it by leveraging alternative flows or more accessible points of influence. This pragmatic approach reflects the reality that leadership is not inherently positive or negative but context-dependent.

‚∏ª

Key Principles

1. Pressure Point Identification

Locate system nodes where:
‚úì Flows naturally converge/diverge
‚úì Small changes create disproportionate impact
‚úì Intervention costs are low relative to potential gains
‚úì System dynamics can be harnessed (not resisted)

Requires understanding both formal structures and informal flow patterns.

2. Accessibility Assessment

Evaluate intervention points by:
	‚Ä¢	Available resources
	‚Ä¢	Anticipated resistance levels
	‚Ä¢	Existing momentum to leverage
	‚Ä¢	Timing/windows of opportunity
	‚Ä¢	Structural/institutional barriers

Prioritizes high-accessibility points to conserve resources.

3. Minimal Intervention Design

Design smallest sufficient modifications that:
‚úì Work with (not against) system dynamics
‚úì Make surgical (not sweeping) changes
‚úì Utilize natural amplification mechanisms
‚úì Avoid triggering system backlash
‚úì Preserve functional elements

Goal: Maximum impact with minimum disruption.

4. Iterative Observation

Post-intervention monitoring tracks:
	‚Ä¢	Immediate/delayed effects
	‚Ä¢	Unexpected consequences
	‚Ä¢	Flow pattern changes
	‚Ä¢	New pressure points emerging
	‚Ä¢	Resistance mechanisms developing

Accepts system unpredictability while gathering crucial data.

5. Adaptive Refinement

Cyclical adjustments based on observations:
	‚Ä¢	Modify ineffective interventions
	‚Ä¢	Amplify successful approaches
	‚Ä¢	Shift to newly accessible points
	‚Ä¢	Adjust timing/intensity
	‚Ä¢	Develop resistance countermeasures

Maintains dynamic responsiveness.

6. Flow Acceleration

Builds momentum by:
	‚Ä¢	Leveraging early wins for resources
	‚Ä¢	Strengthening positive feedback loops
	‚Ä¢	Growing supporter coalitions
	‚Ä¢	Accessing previously blocked points
	‚Ä¢	Creating self-sustaining flows

Makes subsequent changes progressively easier.

7. Strategic Circumnavigation

When facing strong resistance (including leadership resistance):
‚úì Identify alternative pathways
‚úì Bypass (don‚Äôt confront) power centers when they act as bottlenecks
‚úì Create parallel structures or informal coalitions
‚úì Work around leadership when it actively resists change
‚úì Conserve resources for more accessible points of influence
‚úì Leverage leadership when it aligns naturally with the desired flow

Practical approach to power realities.

‚∏ª

Methodological Process

A 10-phase cycle:
	1.	System Mapping - Document current flows/feedback loops
	2.	Pressure Point Analysis - Identify all potential leverage nodes
	3.	Accessibility Evaluation - Assess realistic intervention points
	4.	Intervention Design - Create tailored minimal changes
	5.	Strategic Implementation - Execute with timing awareness
	6.	Systematic Observation - Monitor multidimensional responses
	7.	Adaptive Adjustment - Refine based on results
	8.	Flow Cultivation - Strengthen beneficial dynamics
	9.	Reassessment - Identify new access opportunities
	10.	Iterative Application - Repeat with refined understanding

‚∏ª

Practical Applications

Effective for:
	‚Ä¢	Organizational Change - Culture/process transformation
	‚Ä¢	Public Policy - Surgical interventions with political viability
	‚Ä¢	Community Development - Organic improvement catalysis
	‚Ä¢	Environmental Sustainability - Resource flow redirection
	‚Ä¢	Social Movements - High-leverage advocacy targeting

‚∏ª

Theoretical Foundations

Integrates concepts from:
	‚Ä¢	Systems Theory (interconnections/feedback)
	‚Ä¢	Network Theory (flow patterns/node importance)
	‚Ä¢	Game Theory (response anticipation)
	‚Ä¢	Path Dependency Theory (initial condition effects)
	‚Ä¢	Complexity Science (emergence/non-linearity)

‚∏ª

Structured Methodology: The PIER Process

Pre-step: Change Readiness Assessment
	‚Ä¢	Evaluate leadership willingness
	‚Ä¢	Identify cultural/structural barriers
	‚Ä¢	Assess if resistance itself needs addressing

1. Problem Definition
	‚Ä¢	Clarify desired outcome
	‚Ä¢	Set success metrics
	‚Ä¢	Establish system boundaries

2. Pressure Point Identification
	‚Ä¢	Catalog all opposing factors
	‚Ä¢	Include obvious and subtle influences
	‚Ä¢	Consider multiple levels (individual to environmental)

3. Evaluation Matrix

Rank points by:
‚úì Impact (on desired outcome)
‚úì Accessibility (ease of modification)

Quadrant Prioritization:
	1.	High Impact/High Access - Immediate action
	2.	Low Impact/High Access - Quick wins
	3.	High Impact/Low Access - Long-term strategy
	4.	Low Impact/Low Access - Deprioritize

4. Implementation & Monitoring
	‚Ä¢	Target high-accessibility points first
	‚Ä¢	Document flow pattern changes
	‚Ä¢	Reassess matrix periodically

5. Repetition & Refinement
	‚Ä¢	Update pressure point rankings
	‚Ä¢	Identify new access opportunities
	‚Ä¢	Adjust strategies based on results

‚∏ª

Distinctive Value

Compared to traditional approaches, FRM offers:
‚úì Greater efficiency (impact/resources ratio)
‚úì Enhanced sustainability (self-reinforcing changes)
‚úì Improved adaptability (dynamic response)
‚úì Practical pragmatism (works with system realities)
‚úì Increased resilience (distributed intervention points)
‚úì Broader accessibility (works with limited resources)

This model enables sustainable transformation by strategically redirecting existing flows rather than forcing artificial change.

Defining Pressure Points

Pressure points are specific factors within a system that create resistance against desired outcomes. They represent nodes where tension, blockage, or impedance occurs, preventing a system from naturally moving toward its optimal state. Their strategic value in the Flow Redirection Model depends on both their influence on flows and their accessibility for modification with available resources.

Key Characteristics of Pressure Points:

1. Flow Impact: Directly influence how resources, information, decisions, or energy move through a system, creating bottlenecks or diversions.

2. Scale Spectrum: Range from seemingly ""minor"" factors (broken coffee machines, inadequate parking) to major organizational structures and policies‚Äîboth ends can significantly impact system flows.

3. Measurable Effect: Influence on desired outcomes can be observed, measured, or reasonably estimated.

4. System Location: Exist at any level‚Äîfrom individual behaviors to organizational structures to environmental conditions.

5. Relational Nature: Often emerge at the intersection of different system components or stakeholder relationships.

6. Visibility Spectrum: Range from obvious and acknowledged to subtle and hidden‚Äîwith some of the most powerful being those least visible to leadership.

Types of Pressure Points:

1. Structural: Formal systems, policies, procedures, or physical arrangements (approval processes, office layouts, reporting structures).

2. Process: Inefficiencies, redundancies, or gaps in how work is performed (handoffs, communication bottlenecks, workflow issues).

3. Cultural: Unwritten rules, norms, and shared beliefs that constrain behavior (risk aversion, blame culture, unspoken hierarchies).

4. Resource: Limitations in time, money, skills, or materials that impede progress (budget constraints, talent gaps, tool limitations).

5. Power: Formal and informal authority structures that can block or enable change (key decision-makers, informal leaders, gatekeepers).

6. Personal: Individual behaviors, preferences, fears, or motivations affecting system flows (management styles, resistance patterns).

7. Environmental: External factors constraining or influencing the system (regulatory requirements, market conditions, competitive pressures).

8. Experience: Daily frictions affecting engagement and motivation (workspace comfort, equipment functionality, amenities, commute factors).

 Distinguishing Features:

The Flow Redirection Model uniquely evaluates pressure points on both impact and accessibility, recognizing that high-impact points may be inaccessible while readily modified points may have moderate effects. This approach transcends simple problem identification by acknowledging pressure points exist within dynamic systems with interconnected flows, where changing one point may trigger cascading effects throughout the system.

In practical terms, pressure points represent strategic leverage points where targeted interventions can redirect existing flows toward desired outcomes with minimal resource expenditure.

Why ""Small"" Pressure Points Matter:

1. Cumulative Impact: Individual factors may seem minor but collectively create significant resistance.

2. Emotional Response: Generate reactions affecting engagement, motivation, and discretionary effort.

3. Symbolic Value: Carry weight regarding how much leadership values employee experience.

4. Visibility Gap: Reflect disconnect between leadership perception and actual experience drivers.

5. Accessibility Advantage: Often highly accessible for intervention, making them ideal starting points for building momentum toward larger changes.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

Core Concept:
The Flow Redirection Model enables change in complex systems by identifying and modifying key pressure points where targeted interventions can naturally redirect existing flows toward desired outcomes with minimal resistance. Rather than comprehensive restructuring, it focuses on accessible high-leverage points.

Key Innovations:
1.Impact/Accessibility Matrix: Evaluates potential intervention points based not just on their impact but also on their accessibility with available resources
2. Pressure Point Identification: Systematic approach to finding where flows are impeded, including often-overlooked ""small"" factors
3. Strategic Circumnavigation: Working around resistance (including leadership) rather than directly confronting it
4. Minimal Intervention Design: Creating the smallest changes necessary to redirect flows

Practical Application:
The PIER Process (Problem ‚Üí Identification ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Redirection ‚Üí Repeat) provides a structured methodology that prioritizes interventions based on both impact and accessibility.

Questions for the Community:
1. Does this approach seem novel compared to existing change models you're familiar with?
2. What aspects seem most potentially valuable in real-world applications?
3. What's missing or unclear that would make this more useful?
4. What frameworks does this most remind you of, and how is it different?

I'm not looking to sell anything - just seeking honest feedback from experienced practitioners before I publish this more formally. Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

The jet‚Äôs engines are screaming to their absolute limit. This was a strenuous job even when the plane was new and well-kept: this one is neither, though it has at least been tuned for this occasion. The sound barrier has broken not once but twice today, and everything aboard is paying the price.

He has steady hands, even when the jet shakes. Clarity of purpose amidst the most confusing of missions, the most chaotic of wars. 

Up above, in the heavens, a target. He knows not so much about it, only who is aboard, and how it can be killed. So does the jet. More importantly, the missiles too.

Supersonic speed, and the mother of all climbs. The light on the instrument panel is blinking furiously, weapons begging for their chance to launch. *Not yet*.

Thirty thousand feet, forty thousand feet. There are more jets in the black, half a squadron clawing skywards at once. More are flying and dying elsewhere today, a distraction for any radars, and fighters, that might otherwise be drawn to some mysterious climbing F-15Cs.

Gauges twirl in the fading light, altitude and speed and g force. There‚Äôs five hundred pounds on his chest, more than Earth would ever dare put on him itself.

Earth. What this is for. He doesn‚Äôt look down, for he has only one mission, but outside the quaking cockpit is a world that is fighting and burning for freedom. A blue marble spinning below a raging bull of a jet, itself racing towards an aberration, a monster, a metal creature that should not be here, must be repelled. It has come from across the stars to kill and maim and enslave, and in minutes it will be no more.

Fifty thousand. The plane cries in rage, half at an enemy, half at a pilot uncaring of its needs and ability. She is a fast girl, the F-15C, but she is old, and tired, and yet must fight in this most cataclysmic of wars. 

But it delivers.

Sixty. 

Blood pounds in his ears, his breaths tightly controlled to a rhythm drilled into him. He could see the stars, if he cared to look, but he does not.

Sixty-five. Sixty-six. Sixty-seven.

Sixty-eight.

A laser flashes from the sky above, and a F-15C disappears.

Sixty-nine.

Seventy.

His jet lurches, a pair of telephone poles detach from below it. Shimmering silver, their rockets instantly ignite, and they scream into the darkness.

The jet yells, as he performs a loop, man and machine racing for the ground they hope to safeguard. Mother Earth holds up her end, reducing strain on the near-emptied fuel tanks on their charge downwards.

The missiles give no gratitude for the effort they have been saved from. They are crude, ungraceful next to the machines that have delivered them. They have been hurried into service, a ghost of a weapon that was, a phantom of a weapon to be, a banshee that is racing high in righteous fury. A simple seeker on a not-so-simple warhead plus rocket, and this combination has its results. One fails and dies, falling when its stage should have, but its brother carries on. In total, there are fifteen missiles reaching up from this strike, less than planned.

More than enough.

Lasers blast away, but warheads have begun to separate. Empty stages become targets, and now there are thirty objects closing fast. Twenty-eight. Twenty-seven. Twenty-four. Nineteen.

The missile is not grateful, but it is obedient. The target is intelligent, but not enough. Shields are up, but they have never faced anything like this before.

Twelve objects. Eleven. Ten. Nine.

The missile‚Äôs sensor detects the first detonation, the attack plan precisely calculated. If it hadn‚Äôt known the enemy spacecraft was there, the ignition of a neutron bomb upon its shields would perhaps have given it away. But it is so close, and it is not lost. It is right where it desires to be.

Seven. Six.

The shields are gone, and there is so much hell left to arrive.

The missile pierces through the point defences, and an ultra-near contact detonation ensues. Unbearable light blossoms within the sky for a split second, a tidal wave of neutrons flood through a starship, and an alien crew dies instantaneously. Then the next missile arrives, and the next, and the next, and there is no more anything to obliterate, there is nothing but dust and rads.

And down below, a relieved pilot and plane nose closer to a tanker, thousands of feet above a planet that smiles at the new star it briefly witnessed.

We found out we both spoke Russian as our mother tongue (we're in northern Europe where I grew up). I was the first person she met thet she could speak Russian with so we just kept speaking it and turns out we also live walking distance away from each other. We had some good conversation for a few days and got on the topic of exercise. She mentioned she does yoga and I asked some more about it, the studio etc. and she tells me to let her know if I decide to go. I see that they have a cheap try-out deal and mention that I might try going sometime soon and we can coordinate something, but I didn't decide on a class that specific moment because my schedule was still coming together, I figured I would let her know once I knew my schedule. The next day I wrote I ""Hi, how's it going?"" and got ghosted.

Like four months go by without us talking and suddenly she shoots me a message about a Russian play that is in a theatre nearby where we both live and asks if I wanna go. I figured I would give it another shot, it's in two weeks time, and agree. She checks in with me the a few days later confirming we both got tickets, but apart from that we don't speak at all. Fast forward to yesterday, the day before the play and i still haven't heard anything from her. I let it be figuring she would check in with me but by around 2pm today (play was at 6) she still hadn't sent a message so i reached out to her saying hi. She said she was cleaning and that the play was today followed by a ""when and where should we meet?"". 

I find this odd because if i invite someone to something I make sure to at least check with them the day before and also be the one to come up with a place and time to meet but no. So then all the logistics falls one me. I say well the play is at 6 but give her the option of meeting up somewhere beforehand as it's common to grab a drink before events and such here. Maybe sit outside because the weather is sunny and because again, we have never met and about to go to a play together so it's polite to get to know the person beforehand. She responds with ""Yea, we could!"". Just this hesitant answer that leaves me in a weird position so I suggest a place nearby walking distance away. She responds with the name of a different place that is a bit further and goes ""and then it's only a 10 min walk"". I'm kind of off at this point so I'm like ""Ok, wanna meet there?"" She's like ""I don't know where else to get coffee/tea"" which I guess is what she wanted to drink so she had looked up the place I suggested after all which was an outdoor seating. I end up meeting up with her there and we have a pleasant conversation, everything is going well, then we go to watch the play. 

After as we were saying goodbye there was an awkward silence that I filled in with sort of an""Well do you use whatsapp/let's exchange contacts"" as is usually done with every other group/friend meetup I've been to and she just tensed up an looked reluctant while giving me her number. Then she followed it up with asking what if I'll around during summer and I said yes, to which se said 'well summer is long... "" And I'm like yea and again kind of this silence so I'm filling it in with the usual ok we'll be in touch etc. Then we said goodbye and parted ways.  
  
It felt super odd. Maybe she doesn't meet people in this way much but I am also wondering if she just might be one of those people who use others as a +1 and doesn't feel shame about it. I actually unmatched her because I thought the experience was odd but I still have her number if I wanna reach out.

Someone else sensing some red flags here? It's just odd to me to behave this way toward someone you don't know. Even people in the past who clearly just wanted company to something haven't treated me this way.

[Mobile][Around 2015-2018][2D Pixel Art Adventure Game] A puppet-like man in a dark rainy world, chased by a scary dog, turns into a ghost to enter a building

Hi everyone,
I've been searching for this game for over 5 years and I still can‚Äôt find it. I hope someone here can help. Here's everything I remember:

It was a 2D side-scroller puzzle/adventure game with pixel-art style.

The game started on a rainy night in a dark world.

You played as a man who looked like a puppet or doll, living in a puppet-like world.

In the first level, a huge scary dog chases you and you have to escape it by pushing or stacking boxes.

After escaping, you enter a city where the people seemed tired or uninterested.

You go up to the roof of a house where two men are drinking coffee.

Then, you have to jump off the building to die and become a ghost.

As a ghost, you can now enter a place that was previously blocked by a bodyguard‚Äîpossibly a museum or a house with an old woman inside.

The whole atmosphere was very eerie and quiet.

I played this on an Android device, probably installed from a collection of games transferred from a PC around 2015‚Äì2018.

The game language was English.


I don‚Äôt remember the name at all, but this game has stuck with me and I‚Äôd be so grateful if someone could recognize it. Any help is appreciated!

As someone constantly juggling appliances and devices, a solution like this seemed a lifesaver on paper, and after putting it through its paces, I can safely say it lives up to most expectations. This review is based entirely on my experience using it daily, peppered with insights from feedback I've read elsewhere, and a bit of humor over my tech experiments along the way. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
Straight out of the box, the compact design makes a good impression. Each outlet is sleek and minimalistic, taking up just one wall socket. Plastic as the primary material doesn‚Äôt exactly scream premium but keeps it lightweight and practical. For someone who appreciates a neat and clutter-free space, these compact outlets shine, especially in a crowded multi-device setup. The pure white exterior, though prone to showing dirt or fingerprints, integrates seamlessly with most modern home aesthetics. Bonus points for thoughtful design! 

**Wireless Features and Strong RF Signal**  
Testing the wireless control through walls and windows was an amusing experiment. I tried turning on a lamp upstairs while pressing the remote from the garage, and surprisingly, it worked‚Äîproof of the strong RF signal advertised to function up to 100 feet. This feature, especially in a two-story home, came in handy for things like resetting Wi-Fi routers or turning off the coffee maker after heading to bed. Remarkably, none of my other wireless devices seemed to interfere with it, ensuring seamless operation. 

[Check Syantek BHC1801-5-2 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b08mfbdggf/)  

**Usability and Programmability**  
Programming these outlets wasn‚Äôt complicated at all. Even for someone like my mostly tech-averse uncle, it was manageable after a quick glance at the user manual. One remote can control all outlets through customization, and vice versa, which is particularly beneficial when dealing with multiple devices in larger spaces. Although the process itself was straightforward, it did require a little patience initially. Once set up, though, the multiple configurations made family members feel like tech wizards. The fact that the outlets remain in their ‚Äúoff‚Äù state after power outages to save energy was a small but appreciated touch.

**Merits**  
- Effortless wireless control even through walls and windows.  
- Compact design saves valuable wall socket space.  
- Easy programming allows centralized control for multiple outlets.  
- Ideal for diverse appliances like heaters, lamps, and holiday decorations.  

**Limitations**  
- The plastic build doesn‚Äôt inspire maximum confidence in durability.  
- Pure white finish does tend to show wear and dirt over time.  

**Performance and Target Users**  
With its simplicity and accessibility, this product is perfect for anyone looking to add convenience to their day. My grandmother enjoyed being able to control her lamp from the comfort of her recliner, and I found its operation smooth for office appliances. It‚Äôs also one of those rare products that strike a balance between functionality and accessibility, making it suitable for elderly individuals or those with mobility impairments.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this remote-controlled outlet to similar alternatives, I found notable differences. For instance, some competing brands boast app integration and voice commands, which the Syantek model lacks entirely. On the plus side, those extra features are often linked to pricier and more complex alternatives. Unlike plug-and-play competitors, which may falter in signal strength, this outlet‚Äôs RF signal remains a standout element. Budget-wise, others don‚Äôt offer the same programming flexibility, especially for multi-room setups. While it doesn‚Äôt completely dominate the market, its ease of use and reliability hold their ground.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
Assessing its price-performance ratio, the product fares decently. It‚Äôs neither overly affordable nor priced premium‚Äîit sits in a comfortable middle ground. Given its surprisingly reliable RF performance and practical programmability features, it offers good value for anyone wanting basic, no-frills wireless control solutions. However, homeowners seeking cutting-edge or voice-enabled tech might find alternatives better suited for a little added investment.

I apologize and definitely understand if you won't read till the very end lol. 

I (21m) cannot get over a girl (22f) that I dated for a year whilst studying in Canada. We got together when I was 19, a few months after my prior 2 year long distance relationship ended due to mutual disagreements. 

Anyway, I meet this girl at a party in college and we instantly hit it off. I invite her for coffee and we end up kissing pretty much the same night. She wasn't like any other girls that I dated before, she was very insecure with herself for some odd reason. I noticed that and because I liked her so much I would constantly be there for her and support her, we ended up falling in love.   
  
Its important to note that her and I come from very different backgrounds, I am an international student doing finance and she was (at the time) a 20 year old who got out of high school and worked minimum wage. She had this major problem of self doubt and through our entire relationship together, I stood by her and even convinced her to apply for her degree in nursing. We would spent countless hours applying and doing research on her future career together, really glad that I got her to finally go for her dreams. 

However, since we met in a small Canadian town (where I studied for two years) I got really depressed and make the decision to move to London, a place thats closer to my friends and family. Despite the pain she supported my decision and was there every step of the way for me. I could see how much pain she felt when I got my acceptance letter from a university in London, that marked the end of our physical relationship. We ended up breaking up and I moved to London.

A few months afterwards, for some reason I texted her and we started talking. We talked everyday and started a pseudo long distance relationship, but it didn't last because of the time difference and the workload that both of us had. 

We ended things on good terms, but I can't sleep at night (it's been 3 months since it happened) but I genuinely cannot stop thinking about her. I get so anxious thinking about how she's holding up and if she's still doing her degree. I truly miss her and I wish the best for her, but these thoughts are keeping me up at night.

>We're proud to announce that Yaya's Caf√©, a new daytime offering from the award-winning team behind [Yaya's Kitchen Restaurant](https://yayaskitchen.ca/), will open its doors later this Spring inside Museum London.  
  
Yaya's Kitchen is recognized as a ‚Äúsignature culinary experience‚Äù by [Ontario's Southwest](https://www.ontariossouthwest.com/experiences/signature-experiences/yayas-kitchens-sahel-to-soul-a-culinary-experience/), and winner of the Innovative Culinary Experience Award (2023), and named Best Fine Dining Restaurant in London by [London Inc. Magazine](https://londonincmagazine.ca/2020/04/08/served-with-a-story/) (2024).   
  
Founded by Maryam and Malvin Wright, their work centres the Global Black experience, using traditional grains, flours, and juices from across Africa and the Caribbean, crafted with both modern and ancient techniques. This same spirit will shape Yaya's Caf√©.   
  
More than a caf√©, it will be a space for coffee, culture, and kin. Guests can expect thoughtfully prepared drinks, pastries, and small plates rooted in the culinary traditions of the Sahel, the Caribbean, and the African continent, from cassava pone to Kenyan chai and Guyanese salara ‚Äì all served up in a welcoming space where food becomes a bridge for movement and connection.  
  
We are honoured to partner with a team that continues to transform London's food landscape through story-rich and deeply rooted cuisine. Stay tuned for more information on the grand opening of Yaya's Caf√© at Museum London in the coming weeks!

1kkbx2k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kkbx2k,Lee's Coffee from Costco : Weird Consistency,"A coworker got me a case of bottled Lee's Coffee from Costco. It is sold frozen, but when I buy it I usually put it straight in the fridge and this hasn't halpened before. 

It has this layer of a jelly-like consistency above the liquid. I broke it up a bit here so that layer is broken in these pics, but it has a lighter color than the liquid. 

This box did go through a lot of temperature changes before I opened this particular bottle. She got it at Costco, kept it frozen at home, brought it to me at work where I kept it in the break room fridge, took it home, then put it in my fridge where it has been for a week. It is dated April 2026, and the first bottle I had at work when she first gave it to me was fine, but I'm just curious because I've never seen this before with this product and I've had it several times.

I met him through a common (close) friend we both have. One day we just went for coffee and he ended up asking my friend for my number. We connected, I learned that he‚Äôs married and he‚Äôs in an ethical non-monogamous marriage. I told him ahead of time that I don‚Äôt invest much feelings or look for romance with men like him. (Neither single or lives in my city), he agreed and said he doesn‚Äôt expect more. 

We started having sex every time he visits. Mind blowing sex, I really enjoy it. With time, he asked if we can meet more than once during his visits, then he asked if I can spend the night with him. 

I like having sex with him, but I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable to sleep in his arms. Maybe it‚Äôs my way to not catch feelings?? 
I would like to keep this arrangement as we both really enjoy it. But I want to reset the expectations without hurting him or sounding like a dick. The expectation being, fun sex, no sleepovers. I also don‚Äôt want this to affect our friend in common or put him in an awkward position.

One last thing to clarify, we usually spend a few hours together when we meet, it‚Äôs not like wham bam thank you ma‚Äôam.

1kkbsdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1kkbsdm/its_my_birthday/,It's my birthday!,"Today I am 31. It feels a little surreal to be honest. I have said to myself for the past 4 or so birthdays that this is the one I'll get my shit together for. Plot twist, I definitely didn't! 

Today though I am sober, and I have been for 6 weeks! It's the best present I could have gotten myself. I'm finally showing up for myself for the first time in my adult life, I'm making myself and my health the priority, and damn it feels good. 

I'm so so thankful to be here with you all. I've had many attempts at getting sober, but I've never made it past a week, or put any actual effort into making lasting changes. This time I've been throwing everything I have at this, and it seems that I've turned a corner, one that leads to long lasting peace. 

I feel so incredibly blessed to be sitting here this morning, drinking a coffee and getting some morning sun. I feel genuine happiness, something that I have been missing for a long time. 

I went out and got some of my favourite snacks, and a cheesecake all for me, and I'm going to have the best self care day. 

The thought of drinking today had been playing on my mind more and more as the day got closer. What's worse is my partner is away for work, so there is no accountability. However, right now alcohol is the furthest thing on my mind. A relapse on my birthday? How depressing, even for me. No thank you. Instead I have a sour gummy worm energy drink that tastes like heaven.

I hope you all have a day filled with love and peace, be kind to yourselves.

1kkbs94,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kkbs94/i_just_realized_today_that_ive_now_owned_a/,I just realized today that I've now owned a Breville dual boiler and Baratza Vario for over a decade now. Here are my thoughts on repair and maintenance of the Dual Boiler.,"I've now owned the BES920XL for over a decade now (incredible how time flies).  Purchase date was Dec of 2014.  It's so old now, that the rubber covering on the wheels below disintegrated today as I was moving it around on the table to do a pump repair.  I'm not even sure if this is a replaceable part.  The entire rubber covering over the roller wheels under the bottom just completely fell apart as I was moving it around the table.  We never move it around on the rollers, and it just mostly sits on our counter top.  Really surprised that the rubber just disintegrated.

Anyways, some observations over the years for maintenance / repair:

1) Solenoid valve failed around year 5.  It was a super easy replacement / fix.  Replacement has not failed since.

2) O-rings have NEVER been replaced, and every time I check various ones, they are all in good condition.  

3) I just replaced the Ulta pump today, as it has been failing for a long while.  I have not noticed it myself, since I no longer make lattes / espresso and just do drip in the morning.  My wife is the only one who uses the machine for the past several years.  She noticed it took longer to ramp up the pressure after pre-infusion.  I just noticed in the past few months that pre-infusion wasn't doing anything.  No slow shower of hot water or anything.  I then found a video on YouTube by BrevTech (great channel for Breville repairs), and found out the pump is failing.  I replaced the entire pump this morning, and checked several of the O-rings in there, and they were all in good condition.  Pump replacement was a bit of a PITA, to be frank, but overall took me about half an hour to do.  The machine now works like a charm again, and infact the steam also feels more powerful.

4) I've descaled the machine several times, and every time, I have not been able to successfully complete it without running into some major errors.  This board has saved me and fixed them.  Breville needs to figure out descaling.

5) I only use RO water (around 20 ppm).  Maybe that's why my machine has ran for over a decade.

I estimate that we've averaged about 1.5 shots a day on the machine.  So about 5500 shots pulled and milk frothed.  It hasn't been a trouble free machine at all, but it has been easy and cheap to fix.  I'm going to keep it till we die or the boilers blow.  

The Vario has also been a great little grinder.  We have the ceramic burrs on there.  It now just grinds for drip brew.  It probably has ground about 600 lbs of coffee at this point (1 lb a week for 10 years), and it has never had any problems.  It was also a refurbed grinder too.  We replaced it for espresso with various other grinders over the years, but have now settled on the Sette 270WI.  After trying the Niche Zero, and Monolith Flat for espresso, I think the Sette 270WI is the one we're going to use until we die, or it dies.",3,1746998666.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

üß® The Issue / not a problem:  
Walking around the city has gotten... boring. We walk passed deals, events, pop-ups, and promos, but we do not know they exist.Apps are filled with random generic deals - basically static and dead to where we are.Meanwhile, retailers and brands are lost in the real world.People have simply stopped looking up.What if the real world had a game layer?What if that neighborhood, your favorite caf√©, or that train station were now a part of a discovery hunt, not just for fun, but with real-life rewards?

üí° The Concept:

A location-based AR discovery platform to discover deals, discounts, drops, and experiences mapped to real-life interactions as you go about your real life.Think: Pok√©mon Go, but rather finding monsters, you are finding:

Free coffee ‚òï

Limited merch üëü

Hidden promo codes üéüÔ∏è

IRL loot chests üíé

City-wide challenges üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüó∫Ô∏è

Every element of your environment could be drop zone (continuous engagements and drop experiences) either driven by movement, location, or scanning AR markers.

üîê Key Features:

‚úÖ Location-based DropsDeals, Rewards connected to GPS-data + specific locations: parks, campuses, streets, events, shops, malls.

‚úÖ AR Anchored ObjectsScan visual markers or enter zones to unlock AR treasure chests, brand products, mini-games, or spend the imperative time-limited quests.

‚úÖ Global & Local ChallengesWalk 3km today? Bonus drop. Visit 5 indie cafes this week? Secret badge unlock. You play on weekends? Special ‚Äúcity raid‚Äù events for weekend warriors.

‚úÖ Partner Portal for BusinessShops can drop quests or deals nearby, driving foot traffic and gamified engagement without building an app.

‚úÖ Player Wallet + StreaksUsers will be able to keep a historical collection of deals, badges, xp, and daily streaks. Some drops are rare and could be NFTs or digital collectibles.

‚úÖ Privacy-Aware DiscoveryNo creepy tracking - just opted-in discovery near you. You find the rewards just be moving.

üí∞ Business Model:

B2B SaaS: Partners (brands, stores, events) pay to launch quests/drops and use analytics

Featured Drops: Sponsored by brands (Google ads is spatial)

In-app upgrades: Cosmetic AR items, quest enhancer, premium map overlays

Future: City-wide rewards currency, booster for tourism, DAO-driven discovery maps

üéØ Impact:

Gamifying the real world - exploring, movement, curiosityGiving local brands superpowers - geo-targeted reward systems without thousands of dollars in app costsEvery street you walk on will be an opportunityCreating habits loops of walking + discovery instead of scrolling + forgettingNew engagement layer for cities, campuses, and communities

üî•The Vision:

We are not just building a discovery app, we are building a playable map of the real world.

A treasure hunt shaped by value that turns every walk into a win.

A loyalty system that incentivize motion, not just transaction.An ecosystem where the city becomes the platform.Instead of click-discovery we want you to MOVE-DISCOVER.

To my absolute shock, they've had some absolute STEALS on some protein, and the best part is, you don't have to go to the store blind. Instead, check it out on Amazon as detailed below.

Of note: some ham between $0.49-$0.99/lb, ground pork at 2.68/lb, and 80/20 ground beef at 2.49/lb.

I've stocked up my freezer and estimate I've saved at least $250 in savings compared to prices even at my local WinCo.

1kkbnjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1kkbnjf/extra_virgin_olive_oil_evoo_significantly/,Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) significantly increases lifespan. Here is how to use it and scientific evidence.,"If you could add one simple habit to your life that gives you a healthier heart, a sharper brain, glowing skin, and a longer life‚Äîwould you do it? Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) is that habit. It‚Äôs not hype. It‚Äôs science-backed, ancient wisdom wrapped in a dark green bottle. People in the longest-living places on Earth‚Äîlike Ikaria, Sardinia, and Crete‚Äîdrizzle it on everything. They don‚Äôt just survive. They thrive.

EVOO is packed with powerful polyphenols like oleocanthal and hydroxytyrosol. These natural compounds fight inflammation, protect your cells from damage, and even mimic the effects of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen‚Äîbut without the side effects. When your body isn‚Äôt constantly battling invisible fires, it can focus on healing, rebuilding, and thriving.

Heart health? EVOO‚Äôs a champion. It helps lower bad cholesterol (LDL), raise the good kind (HDL), and makes your arteries more elastic‚Äîso your blood flows like it should. One of the most powerful studies on longevity, the PREDIMED trial, showed that people who added EVOO to their Mediterranean diet had a 30% lower risk of heart attack. That‚Äôs not a maybe. That‚Äôs a real result.

And it‚Äôs not just the heart. EVOO crosses the blood-brain barrier‚Äîthat sacred shield around your mind‚Äîand protects it. It helps prevent Alzheimer‚Äôs by reducing harmful plaques and supports clear thinking as you age. People who use EVOO regularly have sharper memory, better focus, and more stable moods. Your brain is your master switch‚Äîprotect it at all costs.

If you‚Äôre worried about blood sugar, weight, or even cancer risk‚ÄîEVOO helps there too. It stabilizes insulin, keeps your appetite in check, and fights cancer cells before they can spread. It even turns on the same genes that are active during fasting or calorie restriction, like SIRT1 and AMPK‚Äîgenes linked to DNA repair, fat burning, and better mitochondrial function.

Now, not all olive oil is equal. You want cold-pressed, extra virgin, in a dark glass bottle. Look for labels like COOC, PDO, or PGI‚Äîthese show the oil‚Äôs been certified and comes from a real source. Stay away from ‚Äúlight,‚Äù ‚Äúpure,‚Äù or anything in clear plastic. Those oils are stripped, fake, and do more harm than good. If it‚Äôs cheap and smells bland, toss it.

Start simple: take a tablespoon in the morning, maybe with a squeeze of lemon. Drizzle it on salads, over your rice and veggies, in soups, even in smoothies. Some folks even put it in their coffee. Just use 2 to 4 tablespoons daily‚Äîraw when possible‚Äîand you‚Äôre already shifting your health forward. Your skin will thank you. Your heart will thank you. Your future self will thank you.

This isn‚Äôt a trend. This is one of nature‚Äôs true elixirs. If you're serious about health, about living longer and feeling better while you do, EVOO should be on your table every day. It‚Äôs simple. It‚Äôs beautiful. And it works.",12,1746998305.0,immortalists,5,0.77,False

Many report increased energy levels without the jitters associated with caffeine, improved mental clarity, and gradual weight loss when combined with a balanced diet and exercise.

For instance, users like Peggy B. and Russell L. have shared significant weight loss experiences, shedding 35 and 29 pounds respectively, attributing their success to MITOLYN's metabolism-boosting properties. Others have noted enhanced focus and reduced fatigue, leading to more active lifestyles

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued ‚Äî but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.



After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I‚Äôm honestly impressed.

This isn‚Äôt just another energy pill ‚Äî it‚Äôs something different, and in this review, I‚Äôll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it‚Äôs worth considering.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body‚Äôs ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves ‚Äî from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what‚Äôs inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn‚Äôt throwing random ingredients together ‚Äî it‚Äôs built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn‚Äôt been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I‚Äôm no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger ‚Äî more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you‚Äôre just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn‚Äôt for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely ‚Äî especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I‚Äôm fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.



‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



If you‚Äôre serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time ‚Äî think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.

# My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I‚Äôd be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn‚Äôt go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

**‚úÖVisit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**

Doctors told me it was ‚Äújust IBS‚Äù or ‚Äústress-related.‚Äù I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting‚Äîyou name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly,¬†**depressed**. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the¬†**spore-based probiotics**¬†and how they¬†**survive stomach acid**¬†(unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: ‚ÄúWhat do I have to lose?‚Äù

# The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By¬†**day 3**, I noticed something shocking‚Äîmy stomach wasn‚Äôt making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of¬†**week 1**, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in¬†**months**. I‚Äôm talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating‚Äîjust relief.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat‚Äîwithout changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn‚Äôt holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn‚Äôt some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

# Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here‚Äôs what makes this product a¬†**MUST-HAVE**:

‚úÖ¬†**Spore-Based Probiotics**¬†‚Äì These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they¬†**survive the journey through your stomach acid**¬†and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

‚úÖ¬†**Clinically Proven Strains**¬†‚Äì These aren‚Äôt just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is¬†**backed by science**¬†and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

‚úÖ¬†**No Refrigeration Needed**¬†‚Äì PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it‚Äôs easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

‚úÖ¬†**Third-Party Tested**¬†‚Äì You can trust the label. There are¬†**no hidden fillers**,¬†**no fake ingredients**, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

‚úÖ¬†**Real, Lasting Results**¬†‚Äì Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is¬†**one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes**¬†in my health.

# Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

* Bloating or gas
* Irregular bowel movements
* Leaky gut or food intolerances
* Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings
* Skin issues like acne or rashes
* Weakened immunity
* Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

**Then this product is 100% for you.**

Even if you ‚Äúfeel fine,‚Äù the truth is¬†**most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome**¬†without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins‚Äîwe ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

# Final Verdict: I‚Äôll Never Go Without It Again

I‚Äôm now on my¬†**fourth bottle**¬†of PrimeBiome, and I‚Äôll never go without it again. I‚Äôve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation‚Äîshe‚Äôs now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don‚Äôt work. But I can promise you this:¬†**PrimeBiome is different**. It works. And if you‚Äôre even¬†**slightly on the fence**, do yourself the favor and just¬†**try one bottle**. You‚Äôll know within a week or two that something is changing‚Äîand you‚Äôll never want to go back.

**I don‚Äôt say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn‚Äôt just help me poop better‚Äîit gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life.**¬†I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

By week two, my energy improved. I stopped feeling foggy in the afternoon and had the stamina to actually enjoy my evenings instead of collapsing on the couch.

By the end of the month, here‚Äôs what truly blew my mind:

* **My digestion became regular.**¬†No more guessing games with my stomach.
* **I was less irritable.**¬†My mood swings calmed down, and I felt more emotionally stable.
* **My skin started clearing up.**¬†I hadn‚Äôt expected this, but it was a welcome surprise!
* **I lost a few pounds without changing my diet.**¬†Likely because of reduced bloating and improved digestion.

I didn‚Äôt expect miracles. But within the first week, I noticed my bloating went down drastically. My stomach felt lighter. I didn‚Äôt feel like I needed to unbutton my jeans after every meal.

By week two, my energy improved. I stopped feeling foggy in the afternoon and had the stamina to actually enjoy my evenings instead of collapsing on the couch.

By the end of the month, here‚Äôs what truly blew my mind:

* **My digestion became regular.**¬†No more guessing games with my stomach.
* **I was less irritable.**¬†My mood swings calmed down, and I felt more emotionally stable.
* **My skin started clearing up.**¬†I hadn‚Äôt expected this, but it was a welcome surprise!
* **I lost a few pounds without changing my diet.**¬†Likely because of reduced bloating and improved digestion.

Honestly, it felt like someone hit the reset button on my body.

# üåø Key Benefits of PrimeBiome (Based on My Results)

* **Eliminates bloating and gas**¬†within the first few days.
* **Improves gut flora balance**, supporting healthy digestion and absorption.
* **Boosts natural immunity**‚ÄîI haven‚Äôt gotten sick once since I started taking it!
* **Increases energy levels**¬†without relying on coffee or energy drinks.
* **Improves mood and mental clarity**, reducing the dreaded ""brain fog.""

# üí¨ What Other Users Are Saying

I‚Äôm not alone in my experience. Before buying, I browsed dozens of customer reviews on Amazon and other sites. The majority of users report major improvements in their gut health, energy levels, and even weight loss.

Here's what some of them said:

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt Be Fooled by Cheap Alternatives

I‚Äôve made the mistake of buying cheap probiotics before. Most of them don‚Äôt even make it past your stomach acid. You‚Äôre just flushing money down the toilet‚Äîliterally.

**PrimeBiome‚Äôs MAKTrek technology**¬†is what makes the difference. It ensures that the good bacteria reach the intestines alive and ready to work.

And the best part? No refrigeration required, so I can carry it anywhere with me.

# üéÅ Is PrimeBiome Worth the Price?

100% YES.

Considering the quality of the ingredients, the advanced delivery technology, and the results I‚Äôve experienced, this supplement is worth every penny. Plus, they often run discounts if you buy directly from the official site.

And they back it with a¬†**60-day money-back guarantee**, which shows how much they stand by their product.

# üöÄ Final Verdict: PrimeBiome Is a Life-Changer

I don‚Äôt say this lightly‚Äî**PrimeBiome changed my life**.

It gave me my energy, confidence, and gut health back. I no longer live in fear of unpredictable stomach issues or embarrassing moments.

If you‚Äôve been silently suffering with digestive problems, constant fatigue, brain fog, or weak immunity‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time to stop guessing and start healing.

**You don‚Äôt have to accept discomfort as your ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù**¬†You deserve better‚Äîand PrimeBiome might just be the answer you‚Äôve been looking for.",1,1746997788.0,FantasticalCalendar,2,1.0,False

# üåø What Exactly Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a¬†**scientifically-formulated dietary supplement**¬†designed to support your¬†**mitochondrial health**, which is the powerhouse of your cells.

But it‚Äôs not just marketing hype. MITOLYN actually delivers results ‚Äî and fast.

# üòì My Struggle Before MITOLYN

Before discovering MITOLYN, I was in a very dark place health-wise.

* I was always tired, no matter how much I slept.
* My brain felt foggy; I couldn‚Äôt focus even on small tasks.
* My motivation was at an all-time low.
* My skin looked dull, and I was constantly bloated.
* And emotionally? I felt drained.

Doctors couldn‚Äôt pinpoint anything specific. My blood reports came back ""normal,"" yet I knew something was wrong. I tried everything ‚Äî diet changes, gym workouts, yoga, expensive vitamins ‚Äî but¬†**nothing worked**.

One day, I came across a discussion on Reddit where someone mentioned¬†**MITOLYN**. I did my own research, read about the science behind¬†**mitochondrial function**, and how¬†**cellular energy decline**¬†causes most of the symptoms I was experiencing.

It made sense.

So, I gave MITOLYN a try.

# üî¨ What Makes MITOLYN Different?

Here‚Äôs what truly sets MITOLYN apart:

* **Clinically Researched Ingredients**¬†MITOLYN contains ingredients like¬†**CoQ10, NAD+ precursors, resveratrol, PQQ, and acetyl-L-carnitine**¬†‚Äî all proven to boost mitochondrial health.
* **Powerful Antioxidants**¬†It fights oxidative stress, one of the main causes of cellular aging and fatigue.
* **No Filler, No BS**¬†Unlike other supplements, MITOLYN has no artificial junk. It's clean, pure, and effective.
* **Visible Effects in Days, Not Months**¬†I noticed a difference within the¬†**first week**. That‚Äôs how potent it is.

# Week 3:

My digestion improved. I stopped feeling bloated after every meal. People commented that I looked ‚Äúfresher.‚Äù I could tell my¬†**skin was glowing**, and I even lost 2 pounds without trying.

# Week 4:

I felt like¬†**my old self again**¬†‚Äî or maybe even better. I started waking up before my alarm. I had the stamina to exercise again. My mood improved. My mental clarity was off the charts. It was like¬†**someone turned the lights back on inside my body**.

# üß† How MITOLYN Improved My Life

[I'm Not Okay](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=qLGts144T40&si=SaA-LtrOLM590eKS)

Tonight the monsters in my head  
Are screaming so damn loud  
But I built walls so high  
So they never even make a sound  
It's a mask, it's a lie  
It's the only home I've ever known  
'Cause being who I really am  
Has only left me more alone  
I am not okay  
And I need you to see it  
I have so much to say  
And no one to hear it  
The reason I keep quiet  
With so much at stake  
I always feel like a burden, let it silence me  
You'll never understand  
Why it's so hard to say  
I'm not okay  
I wish I had a scar  
Had a bruise on the surface, any kind of proof  
That everything I feel is more than just some sad excuse  
My life's invisible abuse  
I'm either judged or have to hide  
The only symptom you can see  
Is I don't wanna be alive  
I am not okay  
And I need you to see it  
I have so much to say  
And no one to hear it  
The reason I keep quiet  
With so much at stake  
I always feel like a burden, let it silence me  
You'll never understand  
Why it's so hard to say  
I'll never have the words, I can't explain this hell  
But what if it kills me  
If I keep it to myself?  
To myself  
I am not okay  
And I need you to see it  
I have so much to say  
And no one to hear it  
I am not okay  
I am not okay  
I'm never safe  
It's not a phase  
If I finally break  
Would you still stay?

Tonight the monsters in my head  
Are screaming so damn loud

1kkbee8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1kkbee8/is_this_odd_behavior_from_a_potential_new_friend/,Is this odd behavior from a potential new friend?,"I moved to a new city and got bumble bff and matched with another woman my age (I'm 30 she's 35) and we started talking. We found out we both spoke Russian as our mother tongue (we're in northern Europe where I grew up). I was the first person she met thet she could speak Russian with so we just kept speaking it and turns out we also live walking distance away from each other. We had some good conversation for a few days and got on the topic of exercise. She mentioned she does yoga and I asked some more about it, the studio etc. and she tells me to let her know if I decide to go. I see that they have a cheap try-out deal and mention that I might try going sometime soon and we can coordinate something, but I didn't decide on a class that specific moment because my schedule was still coming together, I figured I would let her know once I knew my schedule. The next day I wrote I ""Hi, how's it going?"" and got ghosted.

Like four months go by without us talking and suddenly she shoots me a message about a Russian play that is in a theatre nearby where we both live and asks if I wanna go. I figured I would give it another shot, it's in two weeks time, and agree. She checks in with me the a few days later confirming we both got tickets, but apart from that we don't speak at all. Fast forward to yesterday, the day before the play and i still haven't heard anything from her. I let it be figuring she would check in with me but by around 2pm today (play was at 6) she still hadn't sent a message so i reached out to her saying hi. She said she was cleaning and that the play was today followed by a ""when and where should we meet?"". 

I find this odd because if i invite someone to something I make sure to at least check with them the day before and also be the one to come up with a place and time to meet but no. So then all the logistics falls one me. I say well the play is at 6 but give her the option of meeting up somewhere beforehand as it's common to grab a drink before events and such here. Maybe sit outside because the weather is sunny and because again, we have never met and about to go to a play together so it's polite to get to know the person beforehand. She responds with ""Yea, we could!"". Just this hesitant answer that leaves me in a weird position so I suggest a place nearby walking distance away. She responds with the name of a different place that is a bit further and goes ""and then it's only a 10 min walk"". I'm kind of off at this point so I'm like ""Ok, wanna meet there?"" She's like ""I don't know where else to get coffee/tea"" which I guess is what she wanted to drink so she had looked up the place I suggested after all which was an outdoor seating. I end up meeting up with her there and we have a pleasant conversation, everything is going well, then we go to watch the play. 

After as we were saying goodbye there was an awkward silence that I filled in with sort of an""Well do you use whatsapp/let's exchange contacts"" as is usually done with every other group/friend meetup I've been to and she just tensed up an looked reluctant while giving me her number. Then she followed it up with asking what if I'll around during summer and I said yes, to which se said 'well summer is long... "" And I'm like yea and again kind of this silence so I'm filling it in with the usual ok we'll be in touch etc. Then we said goodbye and parted ways.  
  
It felt super odd. Maybe she doesn't meet people in this way much but I am also wondering if she just might be one of those people who use others as a +1 and doesn't feel shame about it. I actually unmatched her because I thought the experience was odd but I still have her number if I wanna reach out.

Someone else sensing some red flags here? It's just odd to me to behave this way toward someone you don't know. ",3,1746997629.0,FriendshipAdvice,2,1.0,False

The story of my first rage quit.","So, we were having this *brilliant* game tonight; a fresh server, about 30 people in, some folks taking the lead on the radio doing a reeeaal serious job; they even refused to use the town names on the radio in case the enemy might be listening in. Great planning going on, excellent teamwork is happening, we are pushing base by base and clearing getting a solid lead.

So at night time we are planning to take the coastal military hospital, as someone overheard the enemy talking about setting up their main heli base there. I spent a solid 25 minutes sending my construction truck through the woods for two trips in the dead of night to setup a nice and cozy MG nest overlooking the base from the hill. These MGs with 6x optics are sooo effective, it's my favorite weapon in the game by far. I even brought hot coffee and breakfast and my favorite blankie. Boy was I ready. In the mean time the other squads are coordinating the push, getting ready to get in place.

I sit there in my nest overlooking the base and the sea, the first seagulls are waking up and spreading their wings. The USA are getting busy on the base, there's about eight or nine down there working and running about like ants.

The commander tells the squads to move in and to obey radio silence on platoon channel. Night changes into dawn. The tension is  rising.

This is why I play this game. This.

\*chchchchch\* does my audio and my video freezes. crash. the usual AMD GPU error. Quick quick fuck quick restart reload 90 seconds later and I'm back in the game, restored to the same location, lucky me!

And there he is. Out of the woods behind me comes Rambo. Running around bare chested, he clearly spent solid time making sure he got the looks. You *got* to have the looks. Rambo takes a run to get to the MG nest before I'm able to and grabs the gun.

He grabs \*my\* gun.

I open my mike and start saying ""dude, don't you dare fire, you'll give a way our position"".

I just got to the ""dude, don't"" part. He pulls the trigger and empties the whole fucking magazine in one burst, killing one or maybe two enemies. Of course the other squads were not in place yet. All the US soldiers in the base that were busy building and spawning warships stop what they are doing, turn around and face us.

I see them staring at me. And pull out their RPGs. Three. Three RPGS get fired at the same time.

Boom. WASTED.

Well, I guess it was time for bed anyway.

Nevermind.

 Fuck this game.

1kkbdlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kkbdlu/aitah_for_calling_out_a_coworker_for_being_nasty/,AITAH for calling out a coworker for being nasty to me?,"*posted a few hours ago but didn‚Äôt get much response so going for it again to get more opinions*

So I (28f) work at a coffee shop and offered to come in when I don‚Äôt work usually on a Sunday because I figured it would be busy for Mother‚Äôs Day. So I came in and my coworker(20 something f) was immediately short, slamming things around and being nasty and passive aggressive to anything at all i said or did, i could tell she was super pissed at me & it made me really uncomfortable especially because I didn‚Äôt do anything.

 So it got to the point after maybe 10 minutes that I said to this coworker, ‚Äúlisten, I came in on my day off to help. I can see I‚Äôm greatly upsetting you for some reason, & given it‚Äôs my mother‚Äôs last Mother‚Äôs Day alive I am frankly too emotionally spent to closely work with someone being hostile to me for no reason at all when I came in to help and didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. So either we can start over and you can be cordial or I will go home.‚Äù  She stormed out and had a tantrum to our boss about it. But luckily the boss was on my side. (Btw, I wasn‚Äôt lying about my mom or anything, she is currently in the hospital and not doing well, it‚Äôll be a miracle if she lives another year from now.) 

Turns out, she was so mad because our work station wasnt up to her standard after my closing shift yesterday. I worked all day doing prep during a busy day otherwise, but naturally none of the mounds of work I did do actually mattered, but what did matter  was the fact that I forgot to rinse out the coffee pot, and that I only left 6 eggs to start off the day with-not that it matters, but that one is especially ridiculous. 6 eggs for our shop is more than enough to start off with, and this person just seems to have mental health issues that makes her lash out when things aren‚Äôt up to her arbitrary standard.

I don‚Äôt know, but if you ask me, a work station isn‚Äôt a good enough reason to be overtly hostile to someone, and I don‚Äôt know why she assumes I stand around all day doing nothing. I don‚Äôt, I work hard, there‚Äôs just only so much work you can do in a day. I didn‚Äôt leave it in bad shape at all though, and I swear I do take good care of our work station, this person is just unreasonable and cannot rein in her attitude, apparently.


TL;DR left my shift (with boss‚Äô permission, she‚Äôs on my side), after calling out my coworker for being hostile to me. AITAH?",2,1746997569.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

My girlfriend and I (both from Germany, both somewhere around our late 20s ‚Äì average age, you know how it goes üòÑ) will be visiting Austin for one month in June. We‚Äôre super excited to get to know the city and meet some great people!

I went to one of my favorite coffee shops today before they closed and the guy taking my order called me love twice. When he brought my drink to the table I was sitting at before I left, he said ‚Äúhere you go darling.‚Äù I thought it was so sweet. Also, i‚Äôm 22f and he seemed around 25-29. Please don‚Äôt take this the wrong way, but he seemed like a stereotypically straight guy from what I observed. I say that because I was on FaceTime with a friend after and she asked me if he seemed like he was gay? I said no, but you can‚Äôt really assume someone‚Äôs sexuality from just looking at them. Overall, I thought it was such a sweet and wholesome interaction regardless of the intention.

Would this indicate subtitle flirting to just being friendly? Do men typically use pet names casually like this in a friendly way? Thank you! ",3,1746997385.0,AskMenAdvice,33,0.8,False

I‚Äôm using the Breville Dose Control grinder. 

I‚Äôm doing 17g of beans trying to pour a double shot. My first drips start right at 12 seconds or so and then starts pouring which makes me think I‚Äôve gone a smidge too fine, but then the shot finishes right at 22 seconds which makes me think it‚Äôs too course. 

I‚Äôm wondering if my puck prep might be the culprit? I don‚Äôt have a DWT tool or anything yet so just using with what comes in the box. 

Taste wise, the coffee seems good. Maybe slightly bitter but nothing that‚Äôd make me wanna dump the shot.

We probably have 4 or 5 cups a day each. We both strongly prefer yorkshire tea. I'm sure there are many likeminded UK households reading this.

This weekend I went shopping and bought us 200 Tetley tea bags, and now my wife thinks I ought to be burnt at the stake for this treason I've committed against our family

My reasoning is simple

* Once you've had 6 months or more of drinking ONLY yorkshire tea, it stops tasting like yorkshire tea, and just becomes 'tea'. 
* Yorkshire is quite a pricey teabag. To me, it seems a waste to pay extra all the time just to experience the flavour of 'normal tea'
* Tetley is lots cheaper, and though it's not as good as yorkshire, it is still passable. You wouldn't spit it out if it was served at a friend's house, for example (unlike PG or something!)
* Once we've used up the tetley bags, we will go back to yorkshire and will appreciate the taste much more. A much better use of our hard-earned cash

I do this sort of substitution quite regularly. In fact so often I have a catchphrase - ""You can't have your favourite all the time"" (by which i don't just mean you *shouldn't* have it all the time, I mean you *can't* have it all the time because a favourite is comparative but if you're only having the same thing all the time then you can never compare it to anything worse). We are not quite on the breadline as a family, but the few pounds we save on several items in a shop is noticeable saving for us, which I feel justifies this decision

My wife has repeatedly argued about this, and has now had enough and is now refusing to drink the tetley, meaning I have nearly 3 months of subpar tea to endure, alone. I think she's over-reacting and that she should just drink the tetley. But AITAH?",1,1746997232.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False
1kkb81a,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1kkb81a/i_got_a_package_every_day_for_a_week_i_shouldnt/,"I got a package every day for a week. I shouldn't have opened them. Now there's a nightly visitor at my door that only I can hear, and the police think I'm crazy.","

It started exactly one week ago. Last Tuesday. I came home from work ‚Äì just a regular day, nothing out of the ordinary ‚Äì and there it was, sitting on my doorstep. A small package, about the size of a thick novel, maybe a bit wider. It was wrapped in plain brown paper, the kind you get from a roll. It was sealed very thoroughly with clear packing tape, like someone really didn‚Äôt want it to come open accidentally.

The weird thing was, there was no return address. No stamps. No postmark. Just my address, neatly printed in the center in plain, black, block capital letters. It looked like it had been typed on a label maker, or maybe printed from a computer. It was definitely my address, perfectly correct.

My first thought was that a neighbor had dropped something off, or maybe a local delivery that didn‚Äôt go through the usual channels. I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything. I picked it up. It wasn‚Äôt particularly heavy, but it felt solid. I shook it gently. Nothing rattled.

I brought it inside, set it on the kitchen counter, and just stared at it for a bit. There‚Äôs a certain level of unease that comes with an anonymous package, you know? Especially these days. But it wasn‚Äôt ticking, it didn‚Äôt look suspicious in that way. It just looked‚Ä¶ blank. Impersonal.

I considered opening it right then, but something held me back. A little niggle of‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, caution? Or maybe just the fact that I was tired from work and wanted to unwind. I left it on the counter and mostly forgot about it for the rest of the evening.

The next day, Wednesday, another one arrived. Identical. Same brown paper, same meticulous taping, same typed label with my address. No return info, no stamps. Just‚Ä¶ there. On my doorstep, waiting for me when I got home.

Now, two is a pattern. This wasn‚Äôt a misdelivery or a friendly neighbor anymore. This was intentional. I felt a prickle of anxiety. I picked it up, and it felt exactly the same as the first one. Same size, same weight, same lack of rattling. I placed it next to the first one on the counter. They looked like twins.

My mind started racing. Was it some kind of weird marketing gimmick? A prank? I asked my immediate neighbors if they‚Äôd seen anyone drop anything off. Mrs. Henderson next door, who sees everything, said she hadn‚Äôt noticed anything unusual. I even called the local post office, described the packages, and asked if they had any record of a delivery service that might operate this way. The guy on the phone sounded bored and unhelpful, basically told me if it didn‚Äôt have postage, it wasn‚Äôt their problem. ""Could be a courier, could be anyone,"" he'd mumbled before suggesting I call the non-emergency police line if I was concerned.

Thursday. Another package. Same as the others. Now I had three of them lined up on my counter. The anxiety was definitely stronger. This wasn‚Äôt funny anymore. It felt invasive. Someone knew where I lived, and they were deliberately, repeatedly, sending me these mute, anonymous things.

I did call the non-emergency line. I explained the situation to the officer who took my call. I tried to keep my voice calm, rational. ""Look, I know it sounds minor,"" I said, ""but it's three days in a row now. Identical packages, no sender info. It's just‚Ä¶ unsettling.""

The officer listened, or at least I think she did. She asked if the packages seemed threatening, if I‚Äôd been threatened by anyone. I said no, not overtly. They just were. She suggested it was probably a misguided prank, or maybe some company‚Äôs bizarre sample distribution. ""You could just‚Ä¶ not accept them?"" she offered, as if I had a choice when they were just left on my doorstep. ""Or throw them away if they‚Äôre making you uncomfortable. Unless there‚Äôs an actual threat, sir, there‚Äôs not much we can do about someone leaving items on your property if they‚Äôre not hazardous.""

Helpful. So helpful.

Friday. Package number four. I actually felt a knot in my stomach when I saw it. I didn‚Äôt even want to touch it this time. I nudged it with my foot first, then reluctantly picked it up. Same. Exactly the same. The pile on my counter was growing. It felt like they were watching me.

Saturday. Package number five. I was starting to feel besieged. I wasn‚Äôt sleeping well. Every creak in the house made me jump. I kept looking out the windows, hoping to catch whoever was doing this. I even stayed up late on Friday night, watching the porch from the darkened living room, but I must have dozed off because there it was on Saturday morning when I went to get the newspaper.

Sunday. Package number six. My weekend was ruined. I barely left the house. I just kept staring at the six packages. They were a silent, oppressive presence in my kitchen. I‚Äôd walk past them, and my eyes would be drawn to them. What was inside? Why me? The questions looped endlessly in my head. I thought about taking them somewhere, the police station maybe, and just dumping them on their desk. But what would that achieve? They‚Äôd already told me they couldn‚Äôt do anything.

I considered opening them, of course. Many times. The curiosity was immense, a burning itch under my skin. But it was mixed with a potent dose of fear. What if it was something horrible? Something dangerous? The not knowing was torment, but the knowing could be worse. My imagination, fueled by lack of sleep and growing paranoia, was conjuring up all sorts of grim possibilities.

And then yesterday, Monday, the seventh package arrived.

I saw it from the window as I was making coffee, my hands shaking slightly. Another one. Seven days. A full week. That number, seven, it just‚Ä¶ it felt significant. Ominous, even. Like an ultimatum, or a countdown reaching its end.

I didn‚Äôt go to work yesterday. I called in sick. I couldn‚Äôt have focused anyway. I spent the day pacing, staring at the seven packages now lined up like grotesque brown bricks. The kitchen felt smaller, the air thicker. I knew, with a certainty that settled deep in my bones, that I couldn‚Äôt let this go on. I had to know. The not knowing was eating me alive.

So, I decided. Last night. I‚Äôd wait until it was late, until the world outside was quiet. Then, I would open them. All of them.

The hours crawled by. I tried to distract myself with TV, with a book, but my gaze kept drifting back to the packages. They seemed to hum with a silent, expectant energy. Or maybe that was just the buzzing in my own head.

Finally, around midnight, I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore. The house was dead silent. The only sound was the frantic thumping of my own heart. I went to the kitchen. The seven packages sat there, accusingly. I took a deep breath, grabbed a utility knife, and picked up the first one ‚Äì the one that had arrived last Tuesday.

My hands were clammy. The tape was tough, layered. It took some effort to cut through it cleanly. I peeled back the brown paper carefully, as if disarming a bomb. Inside, there was a simple, white, unsealed envelope. Standard letter size. My name and address weren't on this inner envelope. It was completely blank.

My heart hammered against my ribs. I slid my finger under the flap and pulled out what was inside.

It was a single sheet of plain white paper. A4 size, like printer paper. On it, there was a drawing.

A child‚Äôs drawing. Or at least, it looked like one. Done in what looked like black crayon, or maybe a thick marker. It was crude, simplistic. It depicted a house. Two windows, a door, a triangle roof. Simple. But‚Ä¶ it was my house. Unmistakably. The shape of it, the placement of the front window, even the slightly crooked gutter I‚Äôve been meaning to fix. It was my house.

To the far left of the page, almost at the very edge, was a stick figure. Just a circle for a head, a line for a body, two for arms, two for legs. In one of its stick hands, it held another, smaller line, with a blob of red crayon at the tip. A knife. A bloody knife.

Above the drawing, at the top of the page, were two words, also seemingly handwritten in that same black marker, in messy block letters: ""DAY 1.""

I stared at it, a cold dread seeping into me. ""Day 1."" This was the package from last Tuesday. My house. A stick figure with a bloody knife, far away. What did it mean?

My breath hitched. I reached for the second package, the one from Wednesday. My fingers fumbled with the utility knife, my movements jerky. I sliced it open, pulled out the identical white envelope, then the single sheet of paper.

Another drawing. The same house ‚Äì my house. The same stick figure, holding the same red-tipped knife. But this time, the stick figure was a little closer to the house. Not dramatically, but noticeably. It was no longer at the very edge of the page. It had moved perhaps an inch or two inward, towards the drawing of my home.

And above this drawing: ""DAY 2.""

A wave of nausea hit me. Oh god. No.

I scrambled for the third package, tearing at the brown paper with frantic energy. Envelope. Paper. Drawing.
""DAY 3.""
My house. The stick figure. Closer still. Now it was about a third of the way across the page, marching steadily towards the depiction of my sanctuary. The red on the knife seemed brighter, somehow. More deliberate.

I didn‚Äôt need to be gentle anymore. I ripped open the fourth package.
""DAY 4.""
The stick figure was halfway to the house. Its crude, featureless circle head seemed to be staring right at the front door. My front door.

My breathing was shallow, ragged. A whimper escaped my lips. This couldn‚Äôt be happening. It was a sick joke. It had to be. But the sheer, methodical commitment‚Ä¶ seven packages, seven days‚Ä¶

Package five. ""DAY 5."" The stick figure was now much closer, maybe three-quarters of the way there. It was almost in the yard of the crudely drawn house. The knife it held seemed larger, or maybe it was just my terror magnifying it.

I was shaking uncontrollably now. My hands were slick with sweat. I could barely grip the utility knife. Package number six. The one from Sunday. I slashed it open, not even bothering with the envelope, just ripping the paper out.

""DAY 6.""
The stick figure. It was practically at the porch steps in the drawing. Looming. Its presence filled that side of the page. The red on the knife was a sickening smear.

One package left. The one from yesterday. Day seven.
I hesitated. A part of me, a screaming, terrified part, didn‚Äôt want to see it. Wanted to burn them all, to pretend this wasn't happening. But I had to. I had to know how this grotesque storyboard ended.

With trembling fingers, I picked up the seventh package. It felt colder than the others, heavier, though I knew it was an illusion, a product of my fear. I cut it open. Pulled out the envelope. Pulled out the page.

""DAY 7.""

The drawing. My house. And the stick figure‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt just close. It was there. Standing right in front of the door. Its stick arm was raised, the one with the bloody knife. It was positioned as if it was about to knock. Or to slash. Its featureless head was tilted slightly.

I stared at the page, my blood turning to ice. The silence in the kitchen was absolute, save for the roaring in my ears. Day 7. Today. The stickman was at my door. In the drawing.

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

I screamed. Not a loud scream, more like a choked gasp, a sound ripped from my throat. The sound had come from my actual front door. Three distinct, solid knocks.

My heart leaped into my throat, threatening to choke me. I stumbled back from the counter, knocking a glass to the floor. It shattered, the sound unnaturally loud in the charged silence. The drawings‚Ä¶ the stickman at the door in the ""DAY 7"" picture‚Ä¶ and now this.

""Who‚Ä¶ who‚Äôs there?"" I managed to call out, my voice a hoarse whisper. I didn‚Äôt expect an answer. I didn‚Äôt want an answer.

Silence. For a moment, I thought maybe I‚Äôd imagined it. The stress, the horrific drawings‚Ä¶

Then it came. Not a voice. Not another knock.
It was a tapping.
Tap-tap-tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap-tap‚Ä¶

It was light, almost delicate, like fingernails on wood. But the rhythm‚Ä¶ it was a melody. A perverted, skeletal version of a lullaby. Slow, deliberate, chillingly patient. Each tap seemed to resonate through the house, through me.

I was paralyzed. Every horror movie clich√©, every primal fear, it was all real, all crashing down on me. The drawings were a countdown, a warning. And the clock had just struck zero.

The lullaby tapping continued, a soft, insidious rhythm against the wood of my front door. Tap-tap-tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap-tap‚Ä¶ Over and over.

My mind, finally jolted out of its frozen terror by a surge of adrenaline, screamed one word: Police!

I fumbled for my phone, which I‚Äôd thankfully left on the counter. My fingers were clumsy, slick with sweat. I almost dropped it. I dialed 911, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

""911, what‚Äôs your emergency?"" The operator‚Äôs voice was calm, professional, a stark contrast to the chaos erupting inside me.

""Someone‚Äôs‚Ä¶ someone‚Äôs at my door,"" I stammered, trying to keep my voice from cracking. ""They‚Äôre trying to get in. I think‚Ä¶ I think they‚Äôre dangerous.""

""Okay, sir, what‚Äôs your address?""

I gave it to her, my eyes darting between the kitchen doorway, which led towards the front hall, and the drawings spread out on the counter. The ""DAY 7"" drawing seemed to mock me.

""Is the person still there, sir?""

""Yes! Yes, I can hear them. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶ tapping. Like a song."" My voice was trembling so badly I could barely form the words. ""Please, hurry. I got these‚Ä¶ these packages‚Ä¶ they showed this happening.""

""Sir, I need you to stay on the line with me. Are you in a safe location in the house? Can you lock yourself in a room?""

""I‚Äôm in the kitchen. The front door is‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs locked, but‚Ä¶"" But what if a lock wasn‚Äôt enough? What if the stick figure wasn‚Äôt bound by normal rules?

The tapping stopped.
The silence that followed was somehow worse. Pregnant. Expectant.

""Sir? Are you still there?"" the operator asked.

""Yes‚Ä¶ yes. The tapping‚Ä¶ it stopped."" My voice was barely audible.

""Okay, officers are on their way. They should be there in approximately five minutes. Can you see the front door from where you are?""

""No, not directly."" The layout of my house meant the kitchen was towards the back. ""But I‚Äôm not going near it.""

The operator tried to keep me calm, asking questions, but my attention was fractured. Every shadow seemed to move. Every tiny sound the house made ‚Äì the settling of wood, the hum of the refrigerator ‚Äì sounded like a footstep, a breath.

Those were the longest five minutes of my life. I clutched the phone, staring at the drawings. The progression. The relentless approach. It was so methodical. So patient.

Then, finally, I heard it: the blessed sound of sirens in the distance, growing closer. A wave of relief, so potent it almost buckled my knees, washed over me.

Soon, there were flashing blue and red lights painting my windows. I heard car doors, voices outside. Then, a firm, authoritative knock. ""Police! Open up!""

This time, I almost ran to the door. I fumbled with the deadbolt and chain, my hands still shaking, and threw it open. Two officers stood there, expressions serious, hands near their holsters.

""Are you okay, sir?"" one of them asked, his eyes scanning past me into the house.

""I‚Ä¶ I think so. They were here. At the door,"" I babbled, ushering them in. ""The knocking, the tapping‚Ä¶ I got these packages‚Ä¶""

I led them to the kitchen, my words tumbling out in a jumbled mess as I tried to explain the week of anonymous deliveries, the decision to open them, the horrifying drawings. I pointed to the seven sheets of paper laid out on the counter.

The officers exchanged a look. One of them, older, with tired eyes, leaned down to examine the drawings. He picked up ""DAY 1,"" then ""DAY 7,"" his expression unreadable. The other, younger, walked through the ground floor, checking windows and the back door.

""Everything secure, no sign of forced entry,"" the younger officer reported when he returned.

The older officer looked at me. ""Sir, when we arrived, there was no one at your door. We checked the perimeter of your house as we approached. No one.""

""But‚Ä¶ I heard them!"" I insisted, my voice rising with a new kind_of panic. ""The knocking, the tapping lullaby! It was right there!""

""We understand you‚Äôre upset, sir,"" the older officer said, his tone carefully neutral. ""These drawings are‚Ä¶ disturbing, I‚Äôll grant you. Could be some kind of very elaborate, very cruel prank.""

""A prank?"" I felt a surge of frustration. ""This isn't a prank! This thing was at my door!""

""We have a street-facing camera down at the corner,"" the younger officer interjected. ""It sometimes catches activity on this block. We can check the footage from the time you called, see if anyone was approaching or leaving your property.""

A small flicker of hope. ""Yes, please. You‚Äôll see.""

They called it in. We waited. The kitchen felt cold again, the adrenaline ebbing away, leaving me exhausted and raw. The older officer asked me more questions ‚Äì if I had any enemies, any recent disputes, anyone who might want to frighten me this badly. I couldn‚Äôt think of anyone. My life is‚Ä¶ quiet. Normal. Or it was.

After about twenty minutes, the younger officer‚Äôs radio crackled. He listened, then looked at me, then at his partner. His expression was‚Ä¶ strange. Not quite pity, not quite skepticism.

""Well?"" I urged.

He cleared his throat. ""Dispatch reviewed the camera footage from the last half hour. There‚Äôs no one, sir. Nothing. No one approached your door, no one was on your porch. The street was empty at the time you made the call.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. No one. The camera showed no one.
But I‚Äôd heard it. The knocking. The tapping. It was real. I know it was.

The officers were sympathetic, in that professional, detached way. They suggested I might have been under a lot of stress, that the drawings had understandably freaked me out. They implied I might have imagined the sounds, my mind playing tricks on me after such a disturbing discovery. One of them even gently suggested I might want to talk to someone, a doctor, maybe.

They documented the drawings, took my statement. They said they‚Äôd file a report for harassment, but without a suspect, without any physical evidence of someone actually being there‚Ä¶ there wasn‚Äôt much more they could do. They assured me I was safe. They even did an extra patrol around the block before they finally left.

I locked the door behind them, the multiple locks clicking into place with a sound that offered zero comfort. Safe. They said I was safe. But I didn‚Äôt feel safe. I felt more exposed, more vulnerable than ever. If there was no one there, then what had I heard? What was tormenting me?

I gathered the seven drawings, my hands still trembling. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to throw them away. They were evidence, even if only I believed it. I put them back in their envelopes, then back in the brown paper wrappers, and tucked the whole terrible collection into a drawer, as if hiding them would hide the truth.

I didn‚Äôt sleep at all last night. I sat in my living room, in the dark, listening. Every creak, every groan of the house settling, was the prelude to that knock, that tapping. But it didn‚Äôt come.

Until tonight.

It‚Äôs now‚Ä¶ just after midnight. The same time I opened the packages last night. The same time the knocking started.
And it‚Äôs happening again.

As I‚Äôm typing this, I can hear it.
KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.
From the front door. Clear as day. Or, clear as night.

My heart is a frantic bird in my chest. I called out, ""Who‚Äôs there?"" just like last night. My voice was a pathetic, shaky thing.
No answer. Just silence for a beat.
And then‚Ä¶
Tap-tap-tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap-tap‚Ä¶

The lullaby. It‚Äôs back. Fingernails on wood, a delicate, horrifying rhythm.
I know if I call the police, they‚Äôll find no one. The cameras will show nothing. They‚Äôll think I‚Äôm crazy. Maybe I am.

But that tapping‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs real. I‚Äôm listening to it right now. It‚Äôs soft, persistent. It‚Äôs not demanding entry. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ there. Reminding me.
The stick figure from Day 7 might not be physically standing on my porch. But something is. Something invited by those drawings, or something that sent them.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm trapped in my own home, terrorized by a sound no one else can verify.

1kkb74e,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1kkb74e/how_do_i_find_out_if_my_friend_is_gay/,How do I find out if my friend is gay?,"Hi I'm in a bit of a dilemma.

I feel confused, and somewhat lost. I‚Äôve developed feelings for a close friend, who I‚Äôll call Jake, but I‚Äôm not sure how he sees me or our friendship. Sometimes I get the feeling he might share similar feelings towards me, but I‚Äôm not certain because he acts in ways that confuse me. I often think about some situations that have made me doubt.

For example, **he once said ""good night, love""** in a message after I congratulated him on his birthday. Also, he often calls me ‚Äúlove,‚Äù even though he tells me it‚Äôs because his father also calls some of his friends love but **he doesn‚Äôt call anyone else in our group ‚Äúlove,‚Äù only me.**  Also would like to clarify that love in my language is not the same as in British English it is an intimate word with someone you love and it is a word you only use for somebody you love like your wife or husband. Another thing is when we once went for coffee just the two of us, without our other friend, and it was really wonderful. He never told our friend that we went without him. A bit of a confession but I schemed the whole thing of forgetting to invite our friend because ""I thought Jake did it"". And I feel like me and Jake have a closer bond than with our other friend who is also because Jake has told me some problems in his life which are not important to the situation.

Also, I remember him saying that every time he tried being in a relationship with a girl, it went badly because he‚Äôd ‚Äúcool off‚Äù after the first date. This made me think, ‚ÄúWell, maybe he‚Äôs actually gay, like me.‚Äù So I said to him well you might be gay or smth to which he jokingly said ""well idk I might even be"". He‚Äôs also **kissed a few girls**, but not since that conversation. Which again creates confusion because I‚Äôm not sure how that fits into all of this. So I matched him up with a girl I knew and it was true he just grew cold after the first date.

I‚Äôm going through a lot of uncertainty and thinking about all of this, and it‚Äôs really painful. I often wonder if he‚Äôs straight and how our friendship would be affected if I showed him how I truly feel. I‚Äôm trying to balance not wanting to ruin our friendship but at the same time, I can‚Äôt ignore my emotions. I‚Äôm afraid that if I make any move toward him, I might lose him as a friend.

I don‚Äôt have many people to turn to for support because no one but one friend knows I‚Äôm gay and since I moved cities we don't talk much anymore.

I feel like I might go crazy from the stress and uncertainty because I‚Äôm not sure how to handle this. Honestly. So that brought me here.

I‚Äôm asking for help in figuring out how to cope with this situation and how to deal with my emotions towards my friend. And your opinion on my burning question of is he gay or not and what should I do about it.

Btw I apologise for the whole essay on my problems and the grammatical mistakes it probably has english is not my native language. Me and my ""friend"" are not English.",0,1746997100.0,askgaybros,4,0.5,False
1kkb6rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kkb6rb/i_got_a_package_every_day_for_a_week_i_shouldnt/,"I got a package every day for a week. I shouldn't have opened them. Now there's a nightly visitor at my door that only I can hear, and the police think I'm crazy.","

It started exactly one week ago. Last Tuesday. I came home from work ‚Äì just a regular day, nothing out of the ordinary ‚Äì and there it was, sitting on my doorstep. A small package, about the size of a thick novel, maybe a bit wider. It was wrapped in plain brown paper, the kind you get from a roll. It was sealed very thoroughly with clear packing tape, like someone really didn‚Äôt want it to come open accidentally.

The weird thing was, there was no return address. No stamps. No postmark. Just my address, neatly printed in the center in plain, black, block capital letters. It looked like it had been typed on a label maker, or maybe printed from a computer. It was definitely my address, perfectly correct.

My first thought was that a neighbor had dropped something off, or maybe a local delivery that didn‚Äôt go through the usual channels. I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything. I picked it up. It wasn‚Äôt particularly heavy, but it felt solid. I shook it gently. Nothing rattled.

I brought it inside, set it on the kitchen counter, and just stared at it for a bit. There‚Äôs a certain level of unease that comes with an anonymous package, you know? Especially these days. But it wasn‚Äôt ticking, it didn‚Äôt look suspicious in that way. It just looked‚Ä¶ blank. Impersonal.

I considered opening it right then, but something held me back. A little niggle of‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, caution? Or maybe just the fact that I was tired from work and wanted to unwind. I left it on the counter and mostly forgot about it for the rest of the evening.

The next day, Wednesday, another one arrived. Identical. Same brown paper, same meticulous taping, same typed label with my address. No return info, no stamps. Just‚Ä¶ there. On my doorstep, waiting for me when I got home.

Now, two is a pattern. This wasn‚Äôt a misdelivery or a friendly neighbor anymore. This was intentional. I felt a prickle of anxiety. I picked it up, and it felt exactly the same as the first one. Same size, same weight, same lack of rattling. I placed it next to the first one on the counter. They looked like twins.

My mind started racing. Was it some kind of weird marketing gimmick? A prank? I asked my immediate neighbors if they‚Äôd seen anyone drop anything off. Mrs. Henderson next door, who sees everything, said she hadn‚Äôt noticed anything unusual. I even called the local post office, described the packages, and asked if they had any record of a delivery service that might operate this way. The guy on the phone sounded bored and unhelpful, basically told me if it didn‚Äôt have postage, it wasn‚Äôt their problem. ""Could be a courier, could be anyone,"" he'd mumbled before suggesting I call the non-emergency police line if I was concerned.

Thursday. Another package. Same as the others. Now I had three of them lined up on my counter. The anxiety was definitely stronger. This wasn‚Äôt funny anymore. It felt invasive. Someone knew where I lived, and they were deliberately, repeatedly, sending me these mute, anonymous things.

I did call the non-emergency line. I explained the situation to the officer who took my call. I tried to keep my voice calm, rational. ""Look, I know it sounds minor,"" I said, ""but it's three days in a row now. Identical packages, no sender info. It's just‚Ä¶ unsettling.""

The officer listened, or at least I think she did. She asked if the packages seemed threatening, if I‚Äôd been threatened by anyone. I said no, not overtly. They just were. She suggested it was probably a misguided prank, or maybe some company‚Äôs bizarre sample distribution. ""You could just‚Ä¶ not accept them?"" she offered, as if I had a choice when they were just left on my doorstep. ""Or throw them away if they‚Äôre making you uncomfortable. Unless there‚Äôs an actual threat, sir, there‚Äôs not much we can do about someone leaving items on your property if they‚Äôre not hazardous.""

Helpful. So helpful.

Friday. Package number four. I actually felt a knot in my stomach when I saw it. I didn‚Äôt even want to touch it this time. I nudged it with my foot first, then reluctantly picked it up. Same. Exactly the same. The pile on my counter was growing. It felt like they were watching me.

Saturday. Package number five. I was starting to feel besieged. I wasn‚Äôt sleeping well. Every creak in the house made me jump. I kept looking out the windows, hoping to catch whoever was doing this. I even stayed up late on Friday night, watching the porch from the darkened living room, but I must have dozed off because there it was on Saturday morning when I went to get the newspaper.

Sunday. Package number six. My weekend was ruined. I barely left the house. I just kept staring at the six packages. They were a silent, oppressive presence in my kitchen. I‚Äôd walk past them, and my eyes would be drawn to them. What was inside? Why me? The questions looped endlessly in my head. I thought about taking them somewhere, the police station maybe, and just dumping them on their desk. But what would that achieve? They‚Äôd already told me they couldn‚Äôt do anything.

Something dangerous? The not knowing was torment, but the knowing could be worse. My imagination, fueled by lack of sleep and growing paranoia, was conjuring up all sorts of grim possibilities.

And then yesterday, Monday, the seventh package arrived.

I saw it from the window as I was making coffee, my hands shaking slightly. Another one. Seven days. A full week. That number, seven, it just‚Ä¶ it felt significant. Ominous, even. Like an ultimatum, or a countdown reaching its end.

I didn‚Äôt go to work yesterday. I called in sick. I couldn‚Äôt have focused anyway. I spent the day pacing, staring at the seven packages now lined up like grotesque brown bricks. The kitchen felt smaller, the air thicker. I knew, with a certainty that settled deep in my bones, that I couldn‚Äôt let this go on. I had to know. The not knowing was eating me alive.

So, I decided. Last night. I‚Äôd wait until it was late, until the world outside was quiet. Then, I would open them. All of them.

The hours crawled by. I tried to distract myself with TV, with a book, but my gaze kept drifting back to the packages. They seemed to hum with a silent, expectant energy. Or maybe that was just the buzzing in my own head.

Finally, around midnight, I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore. The house was dead silent. The only sound was the frantic thumping of my own heart. I went to the kitchen. The seven packages sat there, accusingly. I took a deep breath, grabbed a utility knife, and picked up the first one ‚Äì the one that had arrived last Tuesday.

My heart hammered against my ribs. I slid my finger under the flap and pulled out what was inside.

It was a single sheet of plain white paper. A4 size, like printer paper. On it, there was a drawing.

A child‚Äôs drawing. Or at least, it looked like one. Done in what looked like black crayon, or maybe a thick marker. It was crude, simplistic. It depicted a house. Two windows, a door, a triangle roof. Simple. But‚Ä¶ it was my house. Unmistakably. The shape of it, the placement of the front window, even the slightly crooked gutter I‚Äôve been meaning to fix. It was my house.

To the far left of the page, almost at the very edge, was a stick figure. Just a circle for a head, a line for a body, two for arms, two for legs. In one of its stick hands, it held another, smaller line, with a blob of red crayon at the tip. A knife. A bloody knife.

A wave of nausea hit me. Oh god. No.

I scrambled for the third package, tearing at the brown paper with frantic energy. Envelope. Paper. Drawing.
""DAY 3.""
My house. The stick figure. Closer still. Now it was about a third of the way across the page, marching steadily towards the depiction of my sanctuary. The red on the knife seemed brighter, somehow. More deliberate.

I didn‚Äôt need to be gentle anymore. I ripped open the fourth package.
""DAY 4.""
The stick figure was halfway to the house. Its crude, featureless circle head seemed to be staring right at the front door. My front door.

My breathing was shallow, ragged. A whimper escaped my lips. This couldn‚Äôt be happening. It was a sick joke. It had to be. But the sheer, methodical commitment‚Ä¶ seven packages, seven days‚Ä¶

Package five. ""DAY 5."" The stick figure was now much closer, maybe three-quarters of the way there. It was almost in the yard of the crudely drawn house. The knife it held seemed larger, or maybe it was just my terror magnifying it.

I was shaking uncontrollably now. My hands were slick with sweat. I could barely grip the utility knife. Package number six. The one from Sunday. I slashed it open, not even bothering with the envelope, just ripping the paper out.

""DAY 6.""
The stick figure. It was practically at the porch steps in the drawing. Looming. Its presence filled that side of the page. The red on the knife was a sickening smear.

One package left. The one from yesterday. Day seven.
I hesitated. A part of me, a screaming, terrified part, didn‚Äôt want to see it. Wanted to burn them all, to pretend this wasn't happening. But I had to. I had to know how this grotesque storyboard ended.

With trembling fingers, I picked up the seventh package. It felt colder than the others, heavier, though I knew it was an illusion, a product of my fear. I cut it open. Pulled out the envelope. Pulled out the page.

""DAY 7.""

The drawing. My house. And the stick figure‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt just close. It was there. Standing right in front of the door. Its stick arm was raised, the one with the bloody knife. It was positioned as if it was about to knock. Or to slash. Its featureless head was tilted slightly.

I stared at the page, my blood turning to ice. The silence in the kitchen was absolute, save for the roaring in my ears. Day 7. Today. The stickman was at my door. In the drawing.

KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.

I screamed. Not a loud scream, more like a choked gasp, a sound ripped from my throat. The sound had come from my actual front door. Three distinct, solid knocks.

My heart leaped into my throat, threatening to choke me. I stumbled back from the counter, knocking a glass to the floor. It shattered, the sound unnaturally loud in the charged silence. The drawings‚Ä¶ the stickman at the door in the ""DAY 7"" picture‚Ä¶ and now this.

""Who‚Ä¶ who‚Äôs there?"" I managed to call out, my voice a hoarse whisper. I didn‚Äôt expect an answer. I didn‚Äôt want an answer.

Silence. For a moment, I thought maybe I‚Äôd imagined it. The stress, the horrific drawings‚Ä¶

Then it came. Not a voice. Not another knock.
It was a tapping.
Tap-tap-tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap-tap‚Ä¶

It was light, almost delicate, like fingernails on wood. But the rhythm‚Ä¶ it was a melody. A perverted, skeletal version of a lullaby. Slow, deliberate, chillingly patient. Each tap seemed to resonate through the house, through me.

I was paralyzed. Every horror movie clich√©, every primal fear, it was all real, all crashing down on me. The drawings were a countdown, a warning. And the clock had just struck zero.

The lullaby tapping continued, a soft, insidious rhythm against the wood of my front door. Tap-tap-tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap-tap‚Ä¶ Over and over.

My mind, finally jolted out of its frozen terror by a surge of adrenaline, screamed one word: Police!

I fumbled for my phone, which I‚Äôd thankfully left on the counter. My fingers were clumsy, slick with sweat. I almost dropped it. I dialed 911, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

""911, what‚Äôs your emergency?"" The operator‚Äôs voice was calm, professional, a stark contrast to the chaos erupting inside me.

""Someone‚Äôs‚Ä¶ someone‚Äôs at my door,"" I stammered, trying to keep my voice from cracking. ""They‚Äôre trying to get in. I think‚Ä¶ I think they‚Äôre dangerous.""

""Okay, sir, what‚Äôs your address?""

I gave it to her, my eyes darting between the kitchen doorway, which led towards the front hall, and the drawings spread out on the counter. The ""DAY 7"" drawing seemed to mock me.

""Is the person still there, sir?""

""Yes! Yes, I can hear them. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶ tapping. Like a song."" My voice was trembling so badly I could barely form the words. ""Please, hurry. I got these‚Ä¶ these packages‚Ä¶ they showed this happening.""

""Sir, I need you to stay on the line with me. Are you in a safe location in the house? Can you lock yourself in a room?""

""I‚Äôm in the kitchen. The front door is‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs locked, but‚Ä¶"" But what if a lock wasn‚Äôt enough? What if the stick figure wasn‚Äôt bound by normal rules?

The tapping stopped.
The silence that followed was somehow worse. Pregnant. Expectant.

""Sir? Are you still there?"" the operator asked.

""Yes‚Ä¶ yes. The tapping‚Ä¶ it stopped."" My voice was barely audible.

""Okay, officers are on their way. They should be there in approximately five minutes. Can you see the front door from where you are?""

""No, not directly."" The layout of my house meant the kitchen was towards the back. ""But I‚Äôm not going near it.""

The operator tried to keep me calm, asking questions, but my attention was fractured. Every shadow seemed to move. Every tiny sound the house made ‚Äì the settling of wood, the hum of the refrigerator ‚Äì sounded like a footstep, a breath.

Those were the longest five minutes of my life. I clutched the phone, staring at the drawings. The progression. The relentless approach. It was so methodical. So patient.

Then, finally, I heard it: the blessed sound of sirens in the distance, growing closer. A wave of relief, so potent it almost buckled my knees, washed over me.

Soon, there were flashing blue and red lights painting my windows. I heard car doors, voices outside. Then, a firm, authoritative knock. ""Police! Open up!""

This time, I almost ran to the door. I fumbled with the deadbolt and chain, my hands still shaking, and threw it open. Two officers stood there, expressions serious, hands near their holsters.

""Are you okay, sir?"" one of them asked, his eyes scanning past me into the house.

""I‚Ä¶ I think so. They were here. At the door,"" I babbled, ushering them in. ""The knocking, the tapping‚Ä¶ I got these packages‚Ä¶""

I led them to the kitchen, my words tumbling out in a jumbled mess as I tried to explain the week of anonymous deliveries, the decision to open them, the horrifying drawings. I pointed to the seven sheets of paper laid out on the counter.

The officers exchanged a look. One of them, older, with tired eyes, leaned down to examine the drawings. He picked up ""DAY 1,"" then ""DAY 7,"" his expression unreadable. The other, younger, walked through the ground floor, checking windows and the back door.

""Everything secure, no sign of forced entry,"" the younger officer reported when he returned.

The older officer looked at me. ""Sir, when we arrived, there was no one at your door. We checked the perimeter of your house as we approached. No one.""

""But‚Ä¶ I heard them!"" I insisted, my voice rising with a new kind_of panic. ""The knocking, the tapping lullaby! It was right there!""

""We understand you‚Äôre upset, sir,"" the older officer said, his tone carefully neutral. ""These drawings are‚Ä¶ disturbing, I‚Äôll grant you. Could be some kind of very elaborate, very cruel prank.""

""A prank?"" I felt a surge of frustration. ""This isn't a prank! This thing was at my door!""

""We have a street-facing camera down at the corner,"" the younger officer interjected. ""It sometimes catches activity on this block. We can check the footage from the time you called, see if anyone was approaching or leaving your property.""

A small flicker of hope. ""Yes, please. You‚Äôll see.""

They called it in. We waited. The kitchen felt cold again, the adrenaline ebbing away, leaving me exhausted and raw. The older officer asked me more questions ‚Äì if I had any enemies, any recent disputes, anyone who might want to frighten me this badly. I couldn‚Äôt think of anyone. My life is‚Ä¶ quiet. Normal. Or it was.

After about twenty minutes, the younger officer‚Äôs radio crackled. He listened, then looked at me, then at his partner. His expression was‚Ä¶ strange. Not quite pity, not quite skepticism.

""Well?"" I urged.

He cleared his throat. ""Dispatch reviewed the camera footage from the last half hour. There‚Äôs no one, sir. Nothing. No one approached your door, no one was on your porch. The street was empty at the time you made the call.""

The words hit me like a physical blow. No one. The camera showed no one.
But I‚Äôd heard it. The knocking. The tapping. It was real. I know it was.

The officers were sympathetic, in that professional, detached way. They suggested I might have been under a lot of stress, that the drawings had understandably freaked me out. They implied I might have imagined the sounds, my mind playing tricks on me after such a disturbing discovery. One of them even gently suggested I might want to talk to someone, a doctor, maybe.

They documented the drawings, took my statement. They said they‚Äôd file a report for harassment, but without a suspect, without any physical evidence of someone actually being there‚Ä¶ there wasn‚Äôt much more they could do. They assured me I was safe. They even did an extra patrol around the block before they finally left.

I locked the door behind them, the multiple locks clicking into place with a sound that offered zero comfort. Safe. They said I was safe. But I didn‚Äôt feel safe. I felt more exposed, more vulnerable than ever. If there was no one there, then what had I heard? What was tormenting me?

I gathered the seven drawings, my hands still trembling. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to throw them away. They were evidence, even if only I believed it. I put them back in their envelopes, then back in the brown paper wrappers, and tucked the whole terrible collection into a drawer, as if hiding them would hide the truth.

I didn‚Äôt sleep at all last night. I sat in my living room, in the dark, listening. Every creak, every groan of the house settling, was the prelude to that knock, that tapping. But it didn‚Äôt come.

Until tonight.

It‚Äôs now‚Ä¶ just after midnight. The same time I opened the packages last night. The same time the knocking started.
And it‚Äôs happening again.

As I‚Äôm typing this, I can hear it.
KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK.
From the front door. Clear as day. Or, clear as night.

My heart is a frantic bird in my chest. I called out, ""Who‚Äôs there?"" just like last night. My voice was a pathetic, shaky thing.
No answer. Just silence for a beat.
And then‚Ä¶
Tap-tap-tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap‚Ä¶ tap-tap-tap‚Ä¶

The lullaby. It‚Äôs back. Fingernails on wood, a delicate, horrifying rhythm.
I know if I call the police, they‚Äôll find no one. The cameras will show nothing. They‚Äôll think I‚Äôm crazy. Maybe I am.

But that tapping‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs real. I‚Äôm listening to it right now. It‚Äôs soft, persistent. It‚Äôs not demanding entry. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ there. Reminding me.
The stick figure from Day 7 might not be physically standing on my porch. But something is. Something invited by those drawings, or something that sent them.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm trapped in my own home, terrorized by a sound no one else can verify.

1kkb6hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1kkb6hk/another_diamond_experience_in_the_uk_at_london/,Another Diamond experience in the uk at London bankside,"A little while back, I shared my [first experience as a gold and diamond member in the UK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/s/QgQlsmkjmP) since most of the posts here tend to highlight the USA, where diamond status doesn't hold as much weight. I wanted to follow up with another experience for anyone wondering if gold or diamond is worth it in the UK!

To celebrate my mum‚Äôs retirement birthday, I decided to treat her to a lovely 2-night getaway at the London Hilton Bankside. I booked using my points as a diamond member for a twin room that normally would‚Äôve been around ¬£200 a night.

About two weeks before our trip, I reached out to request a room with a walk-in shower and let them know it was for a special birthday celebration. They quickly mentioned a celebration package, which I decided to pass on, but they confirmed that our room would indeed have the walk-in shower. To my surprise, I even noticed that the room type had changed from a twin to a twin deluxe‚Äîwhat a nice little upgrade!

Then, on the morning of check-in, I checked the app again and saw another upgrade to a king 1-bedroom suite‚Äîan almost ¬£800 a night room! I couldn‚Äôt believe my luck and was so grateful for such a fantastic upgrade and a side bonus of not needing to be in the same room as my snoring mother with some additional privacy too. 

We arrived super early, about 8 hours ahead of the official check-in time. The room wasn‚Äôt ready yet, but they kindly gave us a card to access the executive lounge where we could relax with coffee, cola, and snacks while we waited. After exploring the area for a bit, we received a text letting us know the room was ready about 4 hours earlier than expected!

The room itself was amazing, complete with a complimentary cake to celebrate my mum‚Äôs birthday. The hotel was pure luxury‚Äîspotlessly clean, and the staff were incredibly friendly. As diamond members, we had access to the lounge, which was a nice quiet spot during the day with complimentary hot drinks, soft drinks, and little snacks. In the evenings, there were complimentary alcoholic drinks along with a selection of cakes and hot appetizers. For breakfast, we had the option to dine in the main restaurant or enjoy a smaller selection in the lounge.

One final perk of being a diamond member was the late checkout since our flight home wasn‚Äôt until 8 PM. Although they couldn‚Äôt extend it too much, a couple of extra hours were perfect, and they provided us with another card to enjoy the lounge before heading to the airport through the chaos of the London marathon.

Overall, my diamond experience was absolutely fantastic, and the London Bankside team really deserves a shout-out for their incredible hospitality. I will definitely be making this my go-to hotel for future visits to London!",18,1746997053.0,Hilton,6,0.95,False

# ATTEMPT AT BELONGING

# FRAGMENT 01 ‚Äì THE WORLD RUSHES THROUGH ME BEFORE I WAKE UP

The sound of the bus came before the sun. The neighbor‚Äôs gate slammed shut, slicing through the dawn air like a kitchen knife. The sidewalk hadn‚Äôt even dried from last night‚Äôs rain, but it already held footsteps, tires, commands, coffee in hand.  
The world began without me. Again.

I left the house. Out of reflex, maybe. The street was already too alive. People speaking loudly on the phone, delivery workers with massive backpacks, a woman too heavily made up for such an early hour. Everyone knew exactly where to go.  
I wasn‚Äôt even sure I had really woken up.

The ground gleamed wet. It had a strange tone. A pale reflection coming from the overcast sky ‚Äî that kind of light without definition, washed-out, greenish, as if the day didn‚Äôt have the strength to be born properly.  
Everything seemed to pass over me. As if I were a crack in the asphalt.  
No one notices.  
But when you step on it, you feel it.

I walked two blocks. Just two. Pretended I was going to the bakery. I passed it. It was open. The shelves well-lit. The smell of bread, warm, automatic. People laughing.  
The cashier answered quickly. With a firm, trained voice.  
I stood there, staring at the reflection in the glass. I didn‚Äôt go in.

I sat on a bench in the square. Hard, wet. The wind touched me like it was in a hurry too.  
A car passed slowly.  
An old man coughed behind me.  
Two teenagers argued about something that demanded urgency.  
A dog barked.  
Everything around me called for action. Hurry. Response.

But I...  
I breathed. Just that. A shallow breath.  
And even that felt too slow.

I looked up at the sky again. That pale green disguised as gray. Almost beautiful. Almost.  
It wasn‚Äôt cold. Nor warm. Just... absent.  
As if the day didn‚Äôt want to include me.

I went back home without knowing why. Or maybe I did ‚Äî just not in words.  
I stepped on the doormat and smelled the stale scent of my own life.  
I closed the door.  
And the world, outside, carried on as if nothing had failed.

But it had.  
Again.

in february i met another guy, who i'll call alex. he started talking to me in the cafeteria, but after that 5 minutes of (very superficial) chat, we never really had a conversation. however, every time he saw me in the hallways he'd act like we were VERY good friends (for years almost) and would often ask me to have coffee with him.

what's the problem? Jack and Alex became friends at some point (I'm sure they weren't before) and things changed from that point on:

Jack started talking to me again and asking me out for coffee.

Alex, on the other hand, I think recently started dating Jack's sister, but Jack started ignoring me (not just ignoring, but he AVOIDS even looking at me) again (and Jack's sister looks at me badly for some reason).

I don't know if they said something about me behind my back... I really have no idea what's going on, because I've always been nice to everyone. But it seems like all 3 of them are avoiding me like the plague now (for some reason).


I don't know what to think, because before the two of them became friends there weren't too many problems (yes, Jack used to ignore me, but it was not THAT obvious).",0,1746996896.0,AskMenAdvice,3,0.25,False

I don‚Äôt know everything ‚Äî but I am skeptical. Apparently after seperation he moved 6 hours away (where we live) and has only visited 2-3 times since, so how much effort was really put in?

The last time he saw his eldest daughter, he didn‚Äôt message her one-on-one or arrange to meet, he tracked her down and showed up to her workplace (a caf√©) and was ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù she didn‚Äôt want to talk to him. Apparently, she disappeared into the staffroom then him and my Mum sat down for a coffee and ‚Äúwaited‚Äù for her to come back?????

As for my own story, he never talked to me for the first 2 years of his relationship to my Mum. I didn‚Äôt warm up to him given‚Ä¶ he was in my home and ignored me when he would visit, plus my Mum‚Äôs always had shitty taste in men so I was guarded.

I feel confused, sad, and somewhat lost. I‚Äôve developed feelings for a close friend, who I‚Äôll call Jake, but I‚Äôm not sure how he sees me or our friendship. Sometimes I get the feeling he might share similar feelings towards me, but I‚Äôm not certain because he acts in ways that confuse me. I often think about some situations that have made me doubt.

For example, **he once said ""good night, love""** in a message after I congratulated him on his birthday. Also, he often calls me ‚Äúlove,‚Äù even though he tells me it‚Äôs because his father also calls some of his friends love but **he doesn‚Äôt call anyone else in our group ‚Äúlove,‚Äù only me.**  Also would like to clarify that love in my language is not the same as in British English it is an intimate word with someone you love and it is a word you only use for somebody you love like your wife or husband. Another thing is when we once went for coffee just the two of us, without our other friend, and it was really wonderful. We never told our friend that we went without him. A bit of a confession but I schemed the whole thing of forgetting to invite our friend because ""I thought Jake did it"". And I feel like me and Jake have a closer bond than with our other friend who is also '18m' because Jake has told me some problems in his life which are not important to the situation.

Also, I remember him saying that every time he tried being in a relationship with a girl, it went badly because he‚Äôd ‚Äúcool off‚Äù after the first date. This made me think, ‚ÄúWell, maybe he‚Äôs actually gay, like me.‚Äù So I said to him well you might be gay or smth to which he jokingly said ""well idk I might even be"". He‚Äôs also **kissed a few girls**, but not since that conversation. Which again creates confusion because I‚Äôm not sure how that fits into all of this.

I‚Äôm going through a lot of uncertainty and thinking about all of this, and it‚Äôs really painful. I often wonder if he‚Äôs straight and how our friendship would be affected if I showed him how I truly feel. I‚Äôm trying to balance not wanting to ruin our friendship but at the same time, I can‚Äôt ignore my emotions. I‚Äôm afraid that if I make any move toward him, I might lose him as a friend.

I don‚Äôt have many people to turn to for support because no one but one friend knows I‚Äôm gay and since I moved cities we don't talk much anymore.

I feel like I might go crazy from the stress and uncertainty because I‚Äôm not sure how to handle this. Honestly. So that brought me here.

I‚Äôm asking for help in figuring out how to cope with this situation and how to deal with my emotions towards my friend. And your opinion on my burning question of is he gay or not and what should I do about it.

1kkb0zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kkb0zo/could_hamilton_beach_flexbrew_trio_be_the_best/,Could Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Trio be the best smart coffee maker? Review here!,"Testing the Hamilton Beach 49911 FlexBrew Trio Coffee Maker over the past few weeks felt more like an adventure in convenience than a daily chore. This smart coffee maker grabbed my attention for its compatibility with both K-Cup pods and ground coffee, as well as its integration with Alexa. I'll share my experience with this gadget, breaking down its unique features, advantages, and a few areas for improvement.

**Design & Build Quality**  
Its sleek black finish immediately gives the product a modern look that suits most kitchen aesthetics. With dimensions of 12.3 x 11.1 x 13.5 inches, it‚Äôs surprisingly compact for a dual-function coffee maker. What caught my eye was its intuitive layout. The separate coffee pod and grounds sections make brewing two very different types of coffee straightforward. The 9-pound weight made it sturdy enough not to feel flimsy but still light enough to slide around my counter when needed.

**Brewing Options**  
This machine offers three brewing choices: single-serve pods, ground coffee for a single cup, or a full 12-cup carafe. I loved waking up and using it for different needs on marketing deadlines and lazy Sundays. Brewing ground coffee into my 7-inch travel mug (holds up to 14 oz.) felt like a game-changer for on-the-go mornings. Pod brewing is a breeze too, dispensing a quick 10 oz. cup when I just wanted something fast. That versatility feels indispensable for households with varied coffee rituals.

**Alexa Voice Control Integration**  
Who knew brewing coffee could feel futuristic? With this coffee maker, I simply asked Alexa to start brewing coffee while half-asleep in bed. Setting up Alexa through the smartphone app was straightforward, and functions like turning the machine on/off or checking the status became part of my mornings. I even experimented with creating personalized ""routines,"" such as combining my morning news flash with the coffee brewing. However, the inability to fully adjust brewing strength through voice commands felt like a missed opportunity.

**Perks**  
- Saves time with fast brewing: My 8 oz. cup took only 90 seconds to brew.  
- The 56 oz. removable reservoir reduced my need for constant refilling, handling about seven single servings before needing replenishment.  
- Compatible with both pods and grounds, giving me unparalleled flexibility.   
- Alexa integration added a futuristic convenience.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Brewing 12 cups often felt slower compared to dedicated drip machines.  
- Voice command options were limited‚Äîit couldn‚Äôt handle complex brewing adjustments.  
- Some parts, especially the carafe lid, felt slightly less durable and prone to wear over time.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
While the Hamilton Beach 49911 FlexBrew brings versatility to the table, several rivals stood out for comparison. Keurig‚Äôs K-Duo Plus, for instance, offers similar dual-brewing flexibility but skips smart controls. It does excel in its compact, vertically-centered design that saves counter space. Ninja's DualBrew Pro, meanwhile, provides a broader range of cup sizes and includes milk frothing‚Äîgreat for latte lovers. Where this product shines is its Alexa integration, giving it the upper hand in smart kitchens.

**Price Performance**  
Although it falls in the middle range compared to its competitors, the combination of Alexa functions, variety in brewing options, and an efficient reservoir system makes it feel worth the investment. Some might weigh it against simpler models, but for tech-savvy users or multitaskers like me, the convenience justifies the cost.

1kkb0re,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShanghaiDisneyland/comments/1kkb0re/5725_shanghai_disney_trip_report/,5/7/25 - Shanghai Disney Trip Report,"Very long post, but wanted to provide a detailed experience for my Shanghai Disney trip! Main takeaways at the bottom.


I am a seasoned California Disneyland traveler, former Annual Pass/Magic Key holder. Been to both Florida and Tokyo twice, so I have experienced other Disney parks as well. First time at Shanghai, and found that Shanghai was the most difficult to find information for, which made planning more difficult. Reading a few things about Shanghai Disney made me concerned about my itinerary; only one day vs reading posts about requiring 1.5 days minimum, food being mediocre at best. I did a lot of pre-planning, and for the most port, we did most of everything we wanted to do, and had a very successful day! Additional note, although we are Chinese, we speak zero Mandarin, Google Translate saved us for the most part.


A few months prior, we booked our stay at Toy Story Hotel, had no issues here. I knew that as long as we had our hotel booked, we were guaranteed our tickets to the park, but I had a little anxiety and bought them about 2 weeks prior to us going. An early entry card was given to us as soon as we checked in. We also knew we wanted to take advantage of the ""Royal Banquet Hall with Reserved Viewing Area for Illuminate"". This one stressed me out a little bit, but I think I found out that they open reservations for the following week the Friday prior. I was able to purchase the package online, and then I had to call the restaurant after to reserve our time; they had an English option which helped significantly.


We stayed at Toy Story Hotel to take advantage of early entry. We lined up at Toy Story Hotel shuttle at 6:30AM and were able to get on the second shuttle. We then arrived at the gate and got in around 7:30AM. A lot of people took off running as soon as they got off the shuttle, so I joined them. 


Upon entry, everyone ran to Zootopia. Felt like I was running a marathon We queued up for the ride, and it was approximately 10 min. While in line, we bought DPA for both Tron and Seven Dwarves. Something that I found Shanghai did differently compared to other parks, DPA has a HUGE time window, something like 10am - 7pm. After getting off the Zootopia ride, we walked through Zootopia; a lot smaller than expected. 


It was still very early and empty, so we decided to ride Pirates of the Caribbean. Along the way, we decided to run through the Challenge Trail at Camp Discovery. I initially wanted to skip this since I had the impression that it was for kids, and also I have zero patience waiting for others. Since it was very early, we had the entire trail to ourselves, and it was a lot harder than expected! Especially if you are afraid of heights. I am very glad we decided to randomly go on this, since it was unique to Shanghai, but I wouldn't go on it again. I can see others getting scared and holding up the line. 


Pirates was essentially a walk on, but it was amazing. By far the best Pirates ride. Felt more like a sequel to the other rides if that makes sense. We went on Peter Pan after, which felt like an updated version of California's Peter Pan.

At this point, we decided to chill for a little bit and had breakfast at CookieAnn Bakery Cafe. Primarily since I wanted my morning coffee. I believe at this point it was around 10AM, so the crowd was slowly starting to come in. We decided to do some shopping at Main Street to beat the crowds. Following, we sat and waited for Color parade. Was not the type of parade we were expected, as the floats/characters stopped their route and did their entire routine in one spot. We pretty much got lucky that they stopped in front of us. I don't understand Asia's fascination with Duffy and Friends, but it was great seeing the other characters.


We were sat in front of Mickey's Story Book Adventure, so we decided to watch it after. But apparently we needed a reservation, which was a little confusing. This was different from DPA, but I found in the app where we could reserve for a later time slot. We decided to walked through the Marvel exhibit and took a picture with Dr. Strange. This place was pretty much a ghost town. Following, we went to castle and took pictures. Shanghai has the nicest castle IMO, and the culture in China is fascinating since everyone is pretty much doing a photoshoot. The annoying part here were the 3rd party paparazzi (not affiliated with Disney), kept coming up to us offering to take pictures of us. They were very aggressive. Since we were at the castle, I took this time opportunity to confirm my dinner reservations for the Royal Hall, since I was still a little bit confused about the whole situation. They found my reservations, and gave me a ticket to come back at my time slot (6:30PM).


Walked through Toy Story and had a snack at one of the carts (Wagyu Waffles). This was when we saw another parade going on, so we watched the second half of it (Mickey's Storybook Express). This was more in line with what we were expecting, and really wanted to watch the full thing. So we kept in mind the second showing. 


After this we rode Winnie the Pooh, which was almost identical to Florida's. We then went to queue up for Mickey's Story Book Adventure as our timeslot came up. The majority of the show as in Chinese, but some songs were in English. We really enjoyed this show and would highly recommend it!


At this point, we had some time to kill until the parade, so we rode Toy Story Blasters. I was surprised that it was essentially a walk on as California is always busy. The mechanics were the same at California, but significantly upgraded. Sequencing was better, I would recommend this over California's. After, we just sat and waited for the parade. 


After the parade, we decided to ride Seven Dwarves. Same as Florida's, but fun ride regardless. I heard good things about the egg tarts, so I wanted to try some, and they for sure lived up to the hype! Best thing we ate. After this, we decided to go ride Tron, but ran into the Avengers show in Tomorrowland, so we watched that first. The show was cute, and Tron was identical to Florida; fun ride.


I believe at this point, we ran into the Color Parade again, so decided to watched the second half of it; essentially a different color, since the first viewing we only saw the Yellow point of view. 


We had a little over an hour until our dinner reservations, so we decided to explored DisneyTown. There is a hidden Mickey in the queue for check out at the World of Disney Store. For all the milk tea enthusiasts, there is also a HeyTea at DisneyTown, so I would recommend getting some!


Finally our reservation at Royal Banquet Hall came up, so we were promptly seated. I had already paid for the pre-fixed menu (~$110 USD per person, we splurged for the premium menu), but they gave us the menu instead. I was a little confused since the menu had pricing per item on it, but my server explained that I was able to choose one from each category, and pointed out which one was the premium options we paid for. Before placing our order, Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Daisy came out and gave our room a little dance. I chose the Pork Ribs Soup as my appetizer, and it was our second favorite food item of the day. Mickey, Donald, and Daisy, one at at time made their rounds to each table, we were able to take pictures with them. For Minnie, we had to go to a different room to take a picture with her. Our server came by and scanned our phone to give us entry to our viewing area for the fireworks. Everything went pretty smoothly, when the time came to pay, my server showed me where to go in the app which reviewed a barcode for him to scan, which was the coupon where I pre-paid for our meal. Finally, they gave us a StellaLou popcorn bucket as a gift! Pleasantly surprised, since I don't think I saw anywhere that a popcorn bucket was given.


We were worried about the crowds, especially since people were already queuing up for the fireworks. We decided to do more shopping at main street up until 8:20PM where we went to our area for fireworks. It was a little confusing on where to go, especially since the app didn't want to work for me at this time. There is wifi throughout the park, so I decided to finally use it, and everything went smoothly after. Upon entering our area, there was only another pair waiting with us. It was great since we had a great view of the castle, which allowed us to take lots of pictures. Over the next 30 minutes or so, until the fireworks started, I want to say there were only a total of 20 people in our viewing area. Outside of our area was an ocean of people that was just waiting for the fireworks. This made the Royal Hall dining package worth it. The fireworks felt more like a projection show with hints of fireworks, but it was great. The Avengers sections was my favorite. 


Overall, we missed Soaring, the Pirates show, and Voyage to Crystal Grotto, but we did everything else we wanted to do! We opted out of Soarin since I believe it's the same every where else, Pirates Show just did not align with our timing, and Voyage I wanted to watch at night, but our night schedule was a little bit impacted.


Main takeaways:

* Early entry is very convenient 

* Paying for two DPA was worth it

* Royal Banquet Hall with Illuminations was extremely high value, but a little confusing to book. Would highly recommend doing this.

* Zootopia was smaller than expected 

* Food overall was better than expected 

* Didn't mention this, but there were water refill stations - So bring those water bottles if you want to refill!

* Day trip is doable; read a lot of people suggesting 1.5 - 2 days 

* Mickey's storybook adventure should come to California",5,1746996629.0,ShanghaiDisneyland,1,1.0,False
1kkazsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/immortalists/comments/1kkazsv/best_ways_to_lower_your_heart_rate_before_bed_so/,"Best ways to lower your heart rate before bed so you sleep faster, better and have greater quality sleep for cellular repair, brain cleaning and rest.","If you want deeper, more healing sleep, one of the best things you can do is lower your heart rate before bed. A calm heart is a signal to your body that it‚Äôs safe to relax. When your heart rate slows down at night, your nervous system shifts out of ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù and into ‚Äúrest and repair.‚Äù That‚Äôs when real sleep magic happens‚Äîyour brain gets cleaned, your cells recover, and your whole body resets for a better tomorrow.

One of the easiest ways to do this is simply by breathing. Deep belly breathing, like the 4-7-8 method, slows everything down. Inhale slowly for four seconds, hold for seven, exhale for eight‚Äîand repeat. It‚Äôs like a gentle hand on your shoulder saying, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay now.‚Äù This kind of breathing switches on your parasympathetic nervous system, lowers your heart rate, and even melts away stress hormones like cortisol.

Adding a little mindfulness or meditation before bed is powerful too. Just lying there and listening to your breath, doing a body scan, or using a calming voice in a guided meditation can completely shift your state. Yoga Nidra, for example, puts your brain into a deep restful mode without even needing to move your body. Over time, these habits help your heart rate stay low even during sleep, giving you a deeper kind of rest.

Taking a warm shower or bath about an hour or two before bed may seem small, but it does something amazing. The warm water helps your blood flow and relaxes you, but afterward, your core body temperature drops‚Äîand that‚Äôs a signal to your brain that it‚Äôs sleep time. That drop in temperature lowers your heart rate naturally, preparing your body for a great night‚Äôs sleep.

It also helps to avoid stimulants in the evening. That means skipping the coffee after mid-afternoon, avoiding energy drinks, and keeping late-night workouts gentle. Caffeine, nicotine, and heavy meals can all keep your heart rate elevated for hours, even if you feel tired. And don‚Äôt forget screens‚Äîblue light keeps your brain alert and your melatonin down, which can mess with both heart rate and sleep quality. Turn them off at least an hour before you sleep if you can.

Magnesium is like a mineral hug for your nervous system. Forms like glycinate or threonate calm your nerves, slow your heart, and make sleep deeper and smoother. Same goes for gentle herbs like ashwagandha, chamomile, lemon balm, and passionflower. These are time-tested natural remedies that support your body‚Äôs ability to settle down without the harsh side effects of pills.

Another tip? Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet. Your body sleeps best at lower temperatures‚Äîsomewhere between 16 and 19¬∞C (60‚Äì67¬∞F). A cooler environment signals your body it‚Äôs time to wind down, and your heart naturally slows to match. Add soft lighting, blackout curtains, and maybe some white noise, and you‚Äôre building a sleep sanctuary.

Lastly, let music help. Calming, slow-tempo music‚Äîlike soft classical or ambient tracks‚Äîcan lower your breathing rate, slow your heart, and ease you into a dreamy state. It‚Äôs not just relaxing‚Äîit‚Äôs science. Let your body move in rhythm with something gentle, and you‚Äôll drift off easier, sleep deeper, and wake up feeling like you actually rested. Because that‚Äôs what a slow heart gives you: peace, healing, and energy for the life you want to live.",6,1746996559.0,immortalists,1,1.0,False

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I watched it when it came out so I fully knew what to expect but it didn‚Äôt hit me like this the first time.

Even she said it feels like a history of what‚Äôs happening now.

I‚Äôve been a young woman with a pregnancy scare, wanting to die because I knew of no why out. I‚Äôve been used and abused and called a slut for wearing jogging clothes.

How am I supposed to protect my daughters, rapidly approaching that age?

I am sick to my stomach, literally to the point of stress vomiting. I can prepare them with all the confidence in the world but I cannot protect them from a world made ancient by project 2025.

The only thing I know is that I am not sad, I‚Äôm angry. But I don‚Äôt know a way through this. I don‚Äôt know what to do, and I don‚Äôt know how to prepare my daughters.

I haven‚Äôt changed my diet/lifestyle, but my stomach is so insanely bloated and uncomfortable all of the sudden. 

The only thing I can pinpoint is that I was drinking almost exclusively carbonated/mineral waters rather than still water, and have since limited my San pelly intake (tragic), but so far no relief. I do the legs up the wall thing at night for 20 mins, lymphatic dry brushing routines, walking, taking magnesium, eating my carrot salad, and nothing is improving :( Whether I‚Äôve just eaten or haven‚Äôt for 12 hours, my stomach feels so swollen. 

My diet is quite simple and looks like:
Coffee, sugar, collagen powder, skim milk
Orange juice with gelatin
Eggs or low fat A2/A2 yogurt w fruit 
A bunch of dried fruits, maybe a beef jerky stick or some Parmesan or leftovers for lunch 
Dinner of either beef/rice, soup, pasta with tuna
Sometimes ice cream or dark chocolate 

I don‚Äôt know what to do!! Should I try an elimination diet to see if the bloating reduces?

1kkavfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cigar/comments/1kkavfg/drew_estate_java_as_first_ever_cigar/,Drew Estate ‚ÄúJava‚Äù as first ever cigar,"  Hey all, just wanted some opinions. I smoked a Drew Estate Java as my first ever cigar yesterday. I got it punched at the shop for me so I didn‚Äôt have to mess around with clipping it at home, toasted and lit it properly, and made damn sure not to inhale. I have a pretty good palate (was an amateur sommelier for a few wineries and was a curator at a wine bar for a few years) so I‚Äôd like to think it‚Äôs pretty developed. 

  Tasting wise I got a lot of dark chocolate notes, dry cedar notes, STRONG black coffee like you pulled a shot of really acidic espresso and just let it sit on the counter for 5 minutes, and little bit of dark cherry. These notes were all pretty pleasant. Unfortunately the most predominant note was an overwhelming pungent gasoline taste. While not quite nauseating it was definitely incredibly unpleasant and it led to me overall not enjoying the experience at all. 

  My question is, did I just choose a bad crappy cigar for my first experience, or do I just not like cigars at ALL? Perhaps they‚Äôre just not for me, or I haven‚Äôt acquired the taste for cigars yet. Do they all taste like that? Thanks a lot! ",1,1746996241.0,cigar,1,1.0,False

1kkatdt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kkatdt,FHR AMEX Platinum - Vegas Palazzo - Trip Report,"**I posted this earlier but the text was missing I have to repost. Feel free to express your opinion whether it's positive or negative, this post is intended for those who can benefit from. I am Asian, and I am cheap so comment away üòâ.

After reading many posts on this sub and the AmexPlatinum sub about Vegas FHRs, we decided to go with the Palazzo. We want to pay forward by providing as many details as possible for those who consider Vegas for FHR, and/or the Palazzo for their stay. We did NOT pick Vegas because it has the best FHRs, the best ones are overseas. We picked the this hotel because:

* Just few hour drive away
* The nightly rate was roughly $200
* The $100 credit is for F&B, not spa
* We want to spend the bare minimum on this trip (this would explain our choices later)

- Arrived at 2.30pm, walked to the Invited Guest line(left to the general checkin line. There is a sign that says FHR as well.
- Asked for a Sphere view (booked a Luxury King City View Suite)
- The nice desk clerk named Sean, said something like this, the upgrade is 2 tier up, so it won't be free; it's normally $400 difference, but he could offer it for $125, which I politely declined.
- He then asked if we would take advantage of the 4pm checkout, I said no. Then he said, he was able to upgrade to a Sphere view room for us free of charge. Then gave us the paper list of benefits, 2 room keys, my ID, and a few restaurant recommendations.
- Great room on 39th floor, good bed, with spectacular view of the Sphere.
- Went to Black Tap, shared a Caesar salad, wife got a chicken sandwich, I got a wagyu burger, both came with fries, and a lemonade.
- Booked 2 tickets to Michael Jackson One for $200 through Viator ($300 if booked through the official website, parking at Mandalay Beach is $30 by the way)
- Went to Tomi Ramen (good ramen, big portion, very affordable) 
- Went to Bar Mia for 2 drinks and played some slots.
Next day, went to the gym and got breakfast at Bouchon Bakery.
- Checked out and paid my bill online, dropped the room keys off in the box when leaving the parking lot (nightly parking rate is $20)


**TIPS

* Must have your ID and Amex Plat card with you
* If you care about the Sphere view, the South side of the hotel has the best view, but North side is just fine too (see pictures)
* If you can afford $100-$200 out of pocket, pick another restaurant off the list (or ignore the credit and go to Top of the World at the STRAT, you won't regret it üëå)
* Black Tap's food is average and cheap, and don't get the Caesar salad
* When proceeding to pay at restaurants/bars, ask the cashier to charge it to your room (they will ask for your name and suite number). Do NOT pay with your credit card. 
* Bring your ID as the cashier might ask for it to verify
* Palazzo has a very nice gym, go and work out early morning
* For the Michael Jackson One, any seats are good but if you sit front rows, you will miss out some actions happening behind you. Pick the cheapest seat if you're on budget and move the center once the show starts a bit (The staff allows this and there are plenty of empty seats). Best seats are in section 202,203,204 as you would get to see the dancers from the sky, the screens, and some interaction with the dancers.
* If you have MGM status, then self-parking is free at Mandalay Bay(free at Bellagio too if you want to park to see the fountain show and walk the strip)
* I used Paypal offer, credit card offer, and Rakuten to triple stack and earn some Cashback if you consider Viator, or any other sites for that matter.
* If you pick Bouchon Bakery, get the Turkey Pecan sandwich, and have it baked, it's just so goodüëå, along with some coffee, fruits, some sweet bread, take it to the Grand Canal to eat at many available benches and tables whilst enjoying the view.

Wet.
Homeless.

Those three words clung to the guy who sat slumped outside my coffee shop in the afternoon rain.

Perfect. 

Thanks to the increasingly erratic weather, I had the privilege of seeing him in all kinds of seasonal wear: a short-sleeved tee and shorts in the late morning while he chewed on a bagel; later at lunch, sporting a jacket and baseball cap. 

Around then, when the sun scorched the sidewalk, he‚Äôd been uncomfortably bent over a dog-eared paperback. 

College student. Early twenties.

I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was enjoying the book, but he flipped through it quickly, head cocked, eyes glued to each page.

When I glanced out later while wiping down tables, the book was gone. 

He was curled up, pressed into a nest of soaked blankets, trying to hold onto what little warmth he could. 

A cheap plastic raincoat was draped over thick brown curls.

I found myself fascinated by him as the day crept on and he shifted positions. 

I made pastries, watching him with floury fingers, mesmerized as he sat, knees pressed to his chest, staring up at the sky. 

He sat up, then lay down, eventually curling into the fetal position, placing the book over his face.

I made the mistake of peeking out of the window while serving a patron. 

The boy lay on his side with his back to me, unmoving. 

I excused myself, grabbed a blanket from the back, and rushed outside. 

From my observations, he didn‚Äôt *seem* sick. 

I nudged him with my shoe, only to be met with a loud protesting groan. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not *moving*,‚Äù he grumbled, curling further into a ball. 

He emphasized his words, yanking the covers tighter around himself. 

With a start, I realized his tone was something authentic that  I could appreciate‚Äîsardonic and deadpan, with a sliver of irony.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing anything wrong except existing, and I‚Äôm so sorry for my presence. If you touch me, you'll regret it.‚Äù

I pulled the blanket tighter around me, holding it close to my chest. ""Do you... want to come inside?""

He didn't respond for a moment, twisting around to face me, blinking rapidly through thick brown locks plastering his forehead. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúYou're not Karen.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúKaren?‚Äù

‚ÄúKarens,‚Äù he smirked. ‚ÄúPlural. They've been shooting me dirty looks all day.‚Äù 

He cocked his head, amused, maybe intrigued‚Äîmaybe something entirely else. 

He did seem to suddenly care a lot about his hair, shaking it out of his eyes like a wet dog. 

‚ÄúDid you‚Ä¶ want something, dude?‚Äù

Up close, he wasn‚Äôt the type I expected to be homeless: attractive face, sharp jawline, wide brown eyes that reminded me of rich coffee grounds, and freckles speckling his nose. 

Having not lived in the human world for long, I had only just started to learn about societal norms and prejudices. 

He was too clean, hair neatly tucked under his hood and his nails clipped. 

His hygiene was intact, and though his clothes were crumpled, a loose pair of jeans and a jacket, they weren‚Äôt stained. 

I was kind of in awe.

This was a boy who took care of himself, even on the streets, and I couldn‚Äôt help but appreciate that. 

Perhaps it was vanity, or maybe just self respect. 

But then, maybe I had been staring at him for too long.

I was aware I was also soaked, my flimsy umbrella doing nothing to protect me from the vicious downpour, my own hair sticking over my eyes. 

The boy regarded me with amusement, tilting his head like a kicked puppy, his lips curled in something resembling a smirk. When I snapped to and offered the (now soaked) blanket, his expression darkened. 

I was so close to him, I could finally see what I couldn't from afar. When I was observing him from the window of my shop, he was an ordinary human. 

But now I could see his face. The one he tried to hide, ducking under his blankets and hidden behind cheap shades. 

I could see the hollowness in his eyes that was so cavernous, endless, with such prominent shadows and a smile lacking so much warmth that I struggled to fully comprehend the depths of this boy‚Äôs despair. 

I had never quite met a human like him before. Through expression alone, I could read a human face. 

I could see their wishes and dreams, their hopes for the future. But this one‚Ä¶ He was *blank*. 

A nothing, a nobody; a terrifying, hollow shell of a human being. 

The best way I can describe it is like an aura blossoming around him, thick mist suffocating his thoughts, suffocating him. 

Squeezing the happiness from his brain. 

But looking at him, I wasn't sure this boy even knew what happiness was, or had ever known it. 

His entire being, his soul, his mark on this planet, was little more than a smear. 

Depression is what humans call it. We call it severing the will to live. 

Humans can learn to live with it by altering their brain chemistry. 

But to us, it's a death sentence.

Worse than the plague that wiped out my kind. The human boy was dripping in it. 

Drowning, but choosing not to break the surface. 

I stumbled back at the thought of it being contagious, my breath catching in my throat. He wasn't just depressed. 

His will to live was already severed, already withering as time cruelly crept on. 

This human boy wanted to die!

No, not just that. 

He was *going* to die. 

I saw eerie confirmation in dull eyes that didn't quite meet my gaze. 

He was planning his death. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù the boy‚Äôs lips broke out into a grin, and I found myself momentarily losing my mind. 

He shuffled forward, pulling his blankets tighter around himself. 

I had to refrain from stepping back. ‚ÄúWhat's with the glaring? Do I, like, have something on my face?‚Äù

I ignored his laugh. His entire world was still intact, every loved one alive and well, yet this human demanded a fucking pity party. It was pathetic. His smile was fake.

His attitude was faker. I wasn't allowed to pass unfair judgments. 

That's what humans believed. But I could *still* have an opinion. 

He was exactly why my kind had a particular distaste for his. 

Destroy their own planet, and cry victim. 

In his case, destroy his own life, and blame the world instead. I glimpsed his book. 1984. Typical. 

I had read it six times, and each time was more grueling. 

For such a smart species, you would think they would understand that ‚ÄúWe don't care until it's affecting *us*‚Äù would be recognized. 

They had lived and fought through two world wars, and yet somehow, through pure selfishness, they were repeating the exact same mistakes. 

I knew my kind was not perfect. But we were self aware. 

Humans, however, were going in circles. This particular human was a walking contradiction. 

His attractiveness was a privilege; this boy was a child having a tantrum, crying out to the ‚Äúunfair‚Äù world, and as a protest for not being heard, he was going to take his own life. 

I wished my family had that privilege. I wished they could *choose* to die, instead of coughing up their internal organs and suffocating in their own blood. 

I could feel my blood rising, shivers skittering up and down my spine. 

I had sat with my mother for three days straight. She died on the first day, and I held her, cradling her to my chest. 

Mom didn't want to die. 

She wanted to live. Jun, my sister, who died crying, died coughing up her own ravaged lungs, wanted to *live.* 

This boy was a *coward.* His whole kind were cowards. 

I almost turned and left him, my teeth gritted, my stomach crawling into my throat, revulsion filling my mouth. I had already made my choice with Blue. 

I had made my choice with him two weeks earlier, when he first slumped down on the bench outside my shop and shot me a friendly smile through the window. 

I couldn‚Äôt back out, no matter how much the human boy repulsed me. 

Backing out would mean breaking my last promise to Blue. 

‚ÄúDo you want to come inside?‚Äù I asked him. ‚ÄúCoffee is on me.‚Äù

I wasn't sure I liked the way his eyes raked me up and down as he arched a brow. He offered me another soulless smile with too many teeth. ‚ÄúI'm pretty good here, man.‚Äù

I nodded, maintaining my smile. ‚ÄúWhat's your name?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI'm Jules.‚Äù

His smile curled into a grimace, and I took the hint to back away. The human boy‚Äôs expression reminded me of a cornered animal. 

He did the head-tilt thing again, but this time there was a little too much emphasis. 

""I'm sorry, did I fall into an alternate universe where I'm supposed to give strangers my name?"" he demanded.

Jeez, he had mean girl vibes. That‚Äôs what Blue called it, anyway. 

When I didn‚Äôt, or couldn‚Äôt, respond, the boy waved a hand with an eye roll, like I was a stray cat. 

‚ÄúBye.‚Äù His icy glare followed me, brown eyes not as cozy and warm up close as I‚Äôd thought. ‚ÄúStop stepping on my fuckin‚Äô blanket,‚Äù he snapped. 

I detected the slightest accent, like that of a Brit who had lived in the States for most of his life. 

I refused to give up on him. He was an asshole, sure, but he was also vulnerable. He was my second choice, picked from his facial expressions alone. He was so human. That‚Äôs what I wanted. 

""Just a coffee,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou don't have to talk to me. You can sit there, drink it, and then get the fuck out if you want to. But it's raining, and you're soaked, and now I'm soaked, so stop being an *ass* and come inside before I change my mind.‚Äù 

I lifted my shoe from where it had been treading on his blanket, twisted around, and walked away. 

About half an hour later, while I was making drinks for the usual crowd of college kids, he appeared like a specter, soaked through, water dripping from his clothes, peering through the door with wide eyes like a startled deer. 

While he squelched his way toward the counter, three customers abandoned their drinks, making a quick exit. 

Instead of making him coffee, I grabbed him, ignoring his, ‚ÄúWoah, hey! *ow!*‚Äù and led him upstairs to my tiny apartment above the shop, pressing a towel and a change of clothes into his arms. 

As he opened his mouth to protest, I cut him off with a shake of my head. 

‚ÄúThis is my business,‚Äù I hissed, tossing him my bathrobe and shampoo. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not standing there dripping all over my floors.‚Äù

He looked like he might argue, before his eagle eyes found Blue‚Äôs bath bombs in the pockets of my robe. 

Something sour crept into my throat. I thought I got rid of all her things. 

The guy pulled them out, painfully slowly, cupping them in his hands with a smirk. ‚ÄúDoes someone else live here?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot anymore,‚Äù I muttered. 

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù He raised a brow. This guy was childish for his age. ‚ÄúSooo, like, you were dating someone?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúShe was a friend.‚Äù

I turned away from him before I could show any emotion. 

Blue was a hard subject. Leaving him to shower, I returned to my shop. Every customer was gone; their drinks were still lukewarm as I dumped them in the sink. 

He appeared a little later on, hair still damp and fluffy, wearing one of Blue‚Äôs sweaters and a scuffed pair of jeans. 

He took an uncertain seat and I made him our special.

Brewed coffee beans, ice-cold milk, and a sprinkle of my secret ingredient. 

I noticed him watching me as I worked, chin resting on his fist, head cocked, legs swinging, kind of like a human child. 

‚ÄúOne Bloomshot Brew,‚Äù I said, adding extra cream and sliding it across the counter with a smile. 

‚ÄúEnjoy!‚Äù

He stared down at the drink. 

‚ÄúUhh, what is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúCoffee.‚Äù I deadpanned. 

I watched him take a hesitant sip, and just like that, his walls began to crumble, his expression softening into a smile as he downed the whole thing. 

He wasn't quite happy; I‚Äôd say he was more comforted. This boy was constantly on guard, always looking for danger. 

Now, though, I watched his resolve splinter with every sip. The coffee was specifically made to hit every taste bud. 

‚ÄúWow,‚Äù he said with a surprised laugh. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs, uhh, that's actually pretty good.‚Äù

He drank the dregs and, just as I thought, met my gaze hopefully. I was already making him another, sliding it over‚Äî and he downed the whole thing. 

On his third drink, the boy told me his name, giddy, licking froth from his lips. 

Just a few more, and he'd start talking. 

You see, I designed my coffee with three things in mind. 

I wanted to know names, stories, and get them to just the right amount of comfort. 

‚ÄúI'm Ronan, by the way,‚Äù he said. I made him a fourth coffee, this time our weekend special, Rose and Pine latte. He drank without even questioning it. 

‚ÄúJules.‚Äù I introduced myself again. ‚ÄúNo offence,‚Äù I said, leaning forward, copying his demeanor, resting my chin on my fist. 

‚ÄúBut you look like you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.‚Äù

Ronan shrugged with a sheepish smile. He was on drink number five. 

Which meant I was close. He sighed, resting his face in his arms. 

‚ÄúI don't really talk to strangers, but you seem cool,‚Äù he lifted his head. 

‚ÄúSo I guess I'm accidentally pouring my life out to you.‚Äù He chuckled, but his eyes darkened, gaze dropping to the counter. 

‚ÄúI lost my parents when I was a kid,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúCar crash, or whatever.""

His eyes were suddenly so hollow. 

""I survived, and all I remember is everything being upside down, a red streak of blood across the road‚Äîand the radio was still blasting 80s music. We crashed in the middle of nowhere in the English countryside.""

""When they pulled me out of the wreck, I saw my mom‚Äôs head on the side of the road, and she was still fucking smiling.‚Äù

His smile was faraway, dreamlike, his eyes hollow and vacant, like he'd already given up. Something sour crept up my throat. 

It was familiar. The feeling of drowning but not wanting to resurface. I felt it too. 

I felt it with Mom, and Jun. That's what it was, I thought.  Trauma. The human boy was suffering from *trauma*.

I had only felt trauma, but now I was seeing it in pasty, sunken cheeks, and tired eyes that didn't want to live; didn't *want* to have a soul. 

He straightened up and slid his cup over for a refill. I obliged, though my hands weren't supposed to be shaking as I steamed the milk. Trauma. 

That was the nothing in his eyes, the vacant cavern in his soul, the reason behind his insistence on severing his will to live. I had been through the exact same thing. 

‚ÄúAnyway, I was adopted, and my adoptive parents were fucking assholes. I wasn't a son, I was a servant. They were crazy. Locked me in my room and refused to feed me.‚Äù 

His lip curled. ‚ÄúSo, I left and I've been living on the streets ever since.‚Äù 

His frown splintered into a slight smile, and I knew that smile. I knew that kind of agony. It was endless. Monotonous. 

A dull, pounding pain wrapped around your bones, and it would never go away. Healed  or not, it would never leave. 

Ronan wore that smile proudly, finishing his seventh coffee. ‚ÄúI have a pretty concrete plan for what I'm going to do.‚Äù

The words left my mouth before I could bite them back. 

‚ÄúYou're‚Ä¶ going to...‚Äù I didn't have to say it. 

He surprised me with a snort. Maybe the drinks were stronger than I thought.

""Well, yeah,"" he laughed. ""It's either so warm I feel like I'm baking, or cold enough to make me wonder if I'll make it through the night. People are judgmental and fucking cruel, and I am so fucking tired. I miss my parents, man. I miss my home.""

He met my gaze, wide brown eyes filling with tears he tried to swipe away with his sleeve. His eyes had lost their voice a long time ago, probably when his parents died. 

I understood. I understood his exhaustion, his willingness to let go. But I had made my choice too. 

Weeks ago, when I first glimpsed him through the window, head tipped back, smiling at the sun with wide, wondrous eyes. 

He was the perfect human‚Äîeven with his flaws, even with his will to live so weathered‚Äî and no matter how hard he tried, I wasn't letting him go. 

Instead of speaking, I poured him another drink. 

Coffee number eight. 

It wasn't actually coffee. I was just making steamed milk. 

He drank the whole thing. 

He shuffled closer, lowering his voice, his warm breath tickling my cheeks. 

""Between you and me?‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúI'm going to throw myself off the old bridge,"" he scoffed. ""The perfect ending to a sad life.""

‚ÄúCome work for me,‚Äù I said too quickly, my stomach rising into my throat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a spare room in my apartment if you want to crash, and I can offer a decent wage.‚Äù

Ronan‚Äôs smile was unsurprisingly warm. The coffee was already in his system, lowering his inhibitions.

His pupils were starting to expand. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty set, man,‚Äù he said, leaning over the counter to offer a high five. I hesitated before slapping his palm, and he chuckled, drawing back. 

‚ÄúThanks, man. Really. I appreciate you trying to help, but you‚Äôre not going to change my mind. I made my choice when I turned eighteen.‚Äù 

Ronan dragged his thumb around the rim of his coffee cup, his expression crumpling. 

‚ÄúI gave myself five years to be happy.‚Äù He shrugged, and I wondered if he *wanted* to find that something, but never did. 

That was the reason why the human had given up. 

He sighed. ‚ÄúI mean, I've been happy, sure. But I can‚Äôt quite find something worth staying for, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù 

His expression was peaceful, like he was content to walk out of my shop and straight into the path of a truck. He shot me a smile that I knew wasn't a smile. 

It was a goodbye. 

Ronan groaned, his head dropping into his arms. ‚ÄúI want to see my parents again.‚Äù

I fought to keep him talking, leaning forward. I was so close. But this was the hardest part. Getting consent. ‚ÄúRonan.‚Äù

The boy didn't move, content with his face buried in his arms. ‚ÄúMm?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have a spare bed,‚Äù I started to say, before a loud clang cut me off. I twisted around to the shelves behind me, filled with brightly colored bell jars. 

One in particular was moving on its own, subtly sliding toward the edge. I picked it up and peered inside. 

From an outsider's perspective, I was holding a jar with a single lightning bug, a flickering light.

But looking closer, the light bled into the shape of a tiny girl floating on her back, eyes closed, dark brown hair billowing around her. 

I gave the jar a violent shake, and the light glowed brighter, bouncing from one side to the other. 

I heard her sharp squeak, before she dropped to the bottom. 

‚ÄúWhat's *that*?‚Äù

I turned, still holding the jar. 

Ronan was halfway across the counter, wide eyes glued to the jar. 

I tucked her away quickly, ignoring her angry buzzing.

‚ÄúI collect lightning bugs.‚Äù

Ronan rested his chin on his fist, lips curving into a smirk. ‚ÄúLike, fireflies?‚Äù

‚ÄúKind of.‚Äù

He laughed, and it was a good laugh‚Äî a real laugh. 

‚ÄúDude, how old are you again?‚Äù

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught  her glowing brighter‚Äîon purpose‚Äîtrying to catch his attention. It was working. 

Her light was expanding across the jar, and the human boy was already hypnotized, specks of gold reflecting in his eyes. 

Ronan leaned in, transfixed. ‚ÄúCan I see?‚Äù he whispered. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never looked at one this close before.‚Äù 

He reached for the jar before I could stop him, pressing his face against the glass. 

There was so much childlike wonder in his eyes, I didn't move to take it off of him. ‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù he breathed, tracing her tiny buzzing light with his finger. 

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you find it?‚Äù 

He gave the jar a gentle shake. This time, she didn‚Äôt make a sound, just curled tighter at the bottom, wings folded behind her, head tucked in her arms. 

I snatched it back before he could unscrew the lid and set her free. 

‚ÄúIn the forest,‚Äù I said, turning, and placing her back on the shelf. I started to make him his final coffee, but the boy was already standing up and stretching. 

‚ÄúAll right, well, thanks for the coffee and sweater,‚Äù he said with a grin. ‚ÄúCan I keep the sweater? It's actually, like, crazy comfortable.‚Äù

I nodded, hoping I could keep him talking. But he really was leaving. I even picked up the bell jar to try to catch his attention again, like a moth to a flame. 

But this human was smarter than I thought.

I panicked when he grabbed his backpack, offering me a two-fingered salute. ‚ÄúCan you do me a favor, Jules?‚Äù

I found my voice, my chest tight. If I didn't get his consent within the next ten minutes, we were both in trouble. ‚ÄúRonan‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt follow me. Look, you‚Äôre the sweetest guy I‚Äôve ever met, and I‚Äôm pretty sure if I wasn‚Äôt like this, I‚Äôd take you up on your offer.‚Äù

He sneezed into his sleeve, and my gut twisted. It was soft‚Äîbarely even a sneeze. Ronan swiped his nose, rolling his eyes. ‚ÄúSorry. Allergies, I think.‚Äù he settled me with a wide smile that was at peace. 

‚ÄúBelieve me, the worst thing you can do is force me to stay. I said I‚Äôm fine, and, funnily enough, I‚Äôm actually happier than I‚Äôve ever been.‚Äù Ronan reached the door. 

He sneezed again, wrinkling his nose. I noticed him stumble slightly.

I was already moving toward him. I had minutes. ‚ÄúSounds like you‚Äôre getting sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Ronan sneezed again, this time violently, enough to jerk his body. 

He didn't see the streak of blood on his palm, swiping it on his jeans. 

He met my gaze, and I could already see it, an ignition of gold speckling his iris. ‚ÄúProbably the rain.‚Äù

He left the store, sneezing again, spraying blood tinged gold across the glass door. I watched as he stumbled forward. 

Two unsteady steps, swaying left and then right,  before his body gave up, and he hit the concrete face-first. 

His first wail was agonizing. I was paralyzed. I had seen it before, but not like *this*. 

His body was already twisting and contorting, head jerking left to right, bloody chunks spilling from his lips. 

The streets were empty when I pushed open the door. I counted down in my head, my own hands trembling. 

Ronan forced himself upright, but his body was already rejecting human norms, his head hanging, as he choked up slithering red. 

Ronan was the first one I had turned without consent‚Äî and if I didn't get it, I would be dealing with a dark fairy‚Äî a human turned fae with their consciousness intact, their magic unpredictable and twisted, their soul scorched. 

Dark fairies were the reason my world collapsed‚Äîwhy my family was dead. 

I forced myself to stay calm. The human boy could still be saved with his own words. That's why I chose him. 

But when I reached him, his eyes were unfocused and wrong, glassy, with no reflection. I was wrong about him, I thought dizzily, retrieving a blanket and scooping him into my arms. 

Ronan *did* have a soul. I was selfish and judgemental. 

He sneezed again in my arms, choking up a chunk of his lung. 

Fuck. Lungs meant it was deep enough to begin shaping his heart. 

Ten minutes without consent. 

That‚Äôs when the body begins to change as usual. From that point, the clock was ticking. Dark fairies were created from their freedom being stripped away and their inability to choose. 

I managed to carry him back into the shop, just as he screamed, raw, guttural, agonized, His body convulsing so violently that I dropped him. 

His skin was translucent, and I could *see* the change already ripping its way through his body. 

‚ÄúRonan,‚Äù I whispered, gently stroking his hair. I was feverishly aware of his eyes flickering, a bright yellow hue expanding across his pupils. 

His human soul was burning. I forced him to look at me, grasping his cheeks. He did, his head lolling to one side. 

‚ÄúYou told me you want to die. But what if I offered you a new life?‚Äù

""Fuck you,"" he groaned, rolling onto his side. 

The heart came next, slipping from his mouth in wet, slimy tendrils of glistening crimson. His voice was a hoarse cry. ""What did you put in that coffee?""

""Ronan, I'm being serious,"" I hissed, my voice betraying me. ""You have to say yes. That's all you need to say.""

""Get away from me,"" he snarled. ""Get the fuck away from me!""

I held him, cradling his jerking head in my lap. There were two ways I could go. 

With no consent, I could either kill him with raw iron straight through the heart before he could turn, or... I tried one more time, begging him to say a single word. 

It was a verbal contract, a choice he was making. Instead of responding, he spat all over my face.

""Go fuck‚Ä¶ yourSELF!""

His words erupted into a screech that sent his body into an arch. I ran out of time.

""I'm sorry,"" I whispered in his ear‚Äîand I was sorry. It was a method that would usually earn me the death penalty. 

But my species was dead. There was nobody left to punish me. 

The correct way to turn a human was by dosing them over the course of a few hours, which I had done with him. 

Dosing had its limitations. 

It required verbal consent from the human to ensure a mutual turning. 

If a human was turned forcefully, a dark fae was born. 

The alternative‚Äîalbeit heavily controversial‚Äîmethod was through ingesting fae blood, which stopped the transformation into dark fae. 

I had grown up learning about the dark fae creating armies of changelings through non-consensual turnings. 

Without thinking, I bit into my wrist, ripped it open, and forced it into his mouth. Fae blood was the only thing that could stabilize him. 

""Ronan, please,‚Äù  I tried again. ‚ÄúYou have to accept it,"" I hissed. But he spat it out, his eyes rolling back to pearly whites. 

When he didn‚Äôt respond, I watched his facial structure begin to change, the flesh on his back rippling beneath his shirt. 

His body went still for a moment, limbs slack, head lolling. I shuffled back, knowing what came next. 

Wings burst from bloody flaps of flesh oozing golden light, protruding through his spine. His wings were exactly what I expected: too fragile, like they were made of paper, singed at the edges. 

His hand jerked, and above me, the lights flickered.

The sound of shattering glass barely fazed me as I watched Ronan‚Äôs body begin to change. 

Just then, an angry buzzing light hit me in the face. 

I waved her away, and she zipped over to Ronan, glowing brighter as she shifted into a human form, landing gracefully. Her eyes were wide, lips parted. 

Blue knelt beside the boy, cradling his cheeks as blood pooled from his nose and mouth. She shot me a glare, and I sighed. 

""I don't think you want to see this,"" I told her. 

She stayed stubbornly, and I rolled my eyes. ""It's not just a fairy transformation,"" I said, as blood leaked from every orifice. 

He was in the final stage. 

""It's a dark fairy. He didn't consent to be turned, so I can either kill him before he turns, or let him be reborn as‚Äî‚Äù 

I stopped when Blue tilted her head, blinking at me in confusion. She had no fucking idea what I was talking about.

""Just grab his legs,"" I said, and she did, grasping his ankles. 

His wings reminded me of smoldered glass as they fluttered erratically.

When his skin became too hot to touch, I dropped him just as Blue let out a squeak, stumbling back. 

In the time it took for me to take several steps back, squeezing my eyes shut, something warm and wet hit my face. 

I opened my eyes, and there he was‚Äî or *wasn't*. 

Ronan was gone. In his place, shredded human flesh. 

I dropped to my knees next to the human skin, shifted it aside, and plucked out a tiny dim golden light. 

He was limp and covered in blood, his wings like knives cutting my palm. 

When I poked him, he rolled onto his front. I could see his chest moving, hear his bitty breathy gasps.

Blue peered at him, her eyes wide, lips spread into a small smile. 

But she was crying. I picked up a fresh jar, and dropped the boy inside. 

Ronan landed with a *thud*, but he didn't move. 

Fae borns were to be preserved in fairy dust for three days. 

I had no idea what was next for a dark fae. I was in uncharted territory with Ronan. 

I filled the jar, transfixed by the tiny fairy floating, up, up, up, arms dangling, hair haloed around him. 

I screwed the lid on, and gave him a shake for good measure. 

He was perfect. 

Exactly what I imagined. 

What Blue told me, before I took her mind.

1kkan7o,https://i.redd.it/agbl6suxq70f1.png,Building Strong Remote Work Relationships: What the Research Actually Says,"**TL;DR:**
Remote work relationships don‚Äôt deteriorate because people stop caring‚Äîthey fade because we stop designing for connection. Research-backed strategies like virtual co-working, asynchronous bonding, digital ‚Äúwatercoolers,‚Äù and neurodiversity-inclusive communication practices can strengthen team trust and connection. This post breaks down what works and why.

---

In many of the leadership coaching sessions I‚Äôve facilitated, one theme keeps coming up‚Äî*how do you maintain strong relationships in a remote or hybrid work environment?*

Most teams think that connection will happen naturally if you have enough meetings, or that weekly Zoom happy hours are enough to fill the gap. But the data tells a different story. Remote relationship-building requires **design**, not just good intentions.

Here are several **evidence-based strategies** for fostering connection, inclusion, and trust in distributed teams:

---

**Virtual Co-Working Works Better Than You Think**
Think of it like a shared office space‚Äîonly online. A 2023 study from the Journal of Organizational Psychology found that virtual co-working significantly improved focus, reduced feelings of isolation, and increased team camaraderie. Team members work independently while staying on a video call, allowing for ambient connection and occasional check-ins. This approach has been especially helpful for neurodivergent individuals who benefit from external structure or shared presence.

---

**Asynchronous Bonding Is More Inclusive Than Forced Fun**
Instead of trying to find a meeting time that works across time zones and energy levels, consider asynchronous team-building. This can include:

üü¢ Collaborative playlists
üü¢ Weekly photo themes (‚ÄúShare your weekend view‚Äù)
üü¢ Virtual book clubs with flexible discussion posts

Not only are these less intrusive, they‚Äôre also **more neurodiversity-friendly**‚Äîallowing people to engage when and how they‚Äôre comfortable.

---

**Micro-Interactions &gt; Marquee Meetings**
Studies show that short, informal interactions‚Äî‚Äúmicro-interactions‚Äù‚Äîcan have an outsized impact on trust and cohesion. These include:

üü¢ Sharing interesting articles in Slack
üü¢ Spontaneous check-ins (‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your day going?‚Äù)
üü¢ Quick, informal praise or encouragement

Recreating the spontaneity of hallway chats doesn‚Äôt mean replicating them exactly. It means designing for consistent, light-touch interactions.

---

**Empathy-Driven Communication Is a Skill, Not a Trait**
Remote work can amplify misunderstandings. Teaching leaders and teams how to recognize emotional nuance in text, ask clarifying questions, and adjust communication styles based on context is crucial. This is especially important for **neurodivergent team members**, who may communicate or interpret tone differently.

Evidence from HBR and Deloitte shows that **structured empathy training** improves team satisfaction, reduces conflict, and increases psychological safety.

---

**Formal Programs Create Informal Trust**
Don‚Äôt underestimate the power of structured mentorship or buddy systems. While these may seem rigid, they provide an intentional foundation for connection. When thoughtfully implemented, they lead to deeper relationships that go beyond task collaboration‚Äîand they‚Äôre scalable across teams and time zones.

---

**Designing for Neurodiversity Helps Everyone**
Making your remote environment more inclusive for neurodivergent professionals often makes it better for everyone. Some simple examples:

üü¢ Offering multiple formats (text, video, voice)
üü¢ Clear agendas and expectations for meetings
üü¢ Flexible camera policies
üü¢ Noise-cancellation tools for virtual collaboration

Inclusive design is a win-win. It supports performance, psychological safety, and team cohesion.

---

**Intentional Informal Interactions Matter More Than Virtual Happy Hours**
Casual, optional interactions‚Äîwhen designed thoughtfully‚Äîcan be powerful. Think: virtual coffee chats, asynchronous ‚Äúget to know you‚Äù prompts, or shared online experiences (like museum tours or trivia apps). The key is **optional participation and variety**.

---

**Final Thought**
Most remote relationship issues aren‚Äôt due to technology or location‚Äîthey‚Äôre due to inattention. But with intention, we can build environments where connection doesn‚Äôt just survive; it grows.

If you're leading a remote or hybrid team, what‚Äôs something that‚Äôs helped *you* feel more connected? Or what‚Äôs something you‚Äôve tried that didn‚Äôt work as expected? I'd love to hear from others who are navigating this space.",1,1746995628.0,agileideation,0,1.0,False

However, he also sold some coffee stuff unrelated to Herbalife (they're pretty sure of that) and I'm just curious which one it was.

At the beggining we both showed interest in one another, however, before I met him I was entangled with a man who is 10 years older than I am (which I also had met at work), only used me for sex (and always made it clear) and did drugs, which I did with him and am not proud of. I had also just left an abusive workplace. 

My ex lived 2 hours away from work, worked all day in a kitchen (it was a restaurant) and still found time to be with me after work, even knowing he'd be home extremely late. He would take me to the bus stop and let several buses pass by just to be with me. I was immature (still am, was a lot more) so while he was showing genuine care and interest in me, I was flirting with other guys, being too open with other men, etc. Some of it was naivety - I went to drink coffee with a guy because he studied philosophy and I enjoy it. I didn't think this guy would look at it in another way. Some of it was cruelty- one time my ex wanted to go buy something with me at the mall we worked at, and saw I was sitting at a table with another man. One time we were walking and I saw a co-worker with another girl and said I was ""jealous"" (my ex cried). I was a horrible person.

While all of this happened things happened in between too - he distanced himself from me, I asked why and he said ""I am prioritizing you"". Later I found out he sent a text to my manager (whom I had issues with) saying he was attracted to her (she showed me the text). Once I began missing him and tried to be close to him again, once he accepeted it he said he did it to ""test"" her.

I got laid off and on the same day went to live with him. I took all of my stuff and went to his place. A week later he was laid off too. We had a lot of sweet moments - he is an extremely caring, loving man, and has a historic of being cheated on - I met all of his family etc. But we also fought a lot. He started to think I was bringing men to his house because he said he could smell my perfume on our bed and a diff energy? We had streaming fights. A lot of it was my fault and due to my immaturity - I enjoyed inflicting jealousy.

Eventually he kicked me out, blocked me on everything and then in January unblocked me and we met up. He said he wanted to see if things could work out, that he was not promising me a relationship but I started going to his place every weekend and we slept together and such. He was sweet again. But he could not get over the fact I slept wiith another man while we were separated.

He said he prayed to God for a woman like me, that he loves me and such and anyway a lot of things happened that will make this post extremely long. But I remember going to his place several times to knock on his doorstep to beg him to talk to me, to solve things out, to regain his trust. One time he ""ended"" it (this year) and my mom had to help me out of bed so I could shower. Now I have been abusing meds and cigarettes because he said ""move on"" with your life (3 days after saying he believes in a future with me) because I didnt wish him a happy birthday through text (we had planned to meet up and I was waiting to do it in person).
 
I dont know what to do. I feel so lost. The guilt eats me alive that if I had valued him.from the start things would not be this way.",2,1746995506.0,Jung,1,0.75,False

# Training

I always like to tell people I started with cough to 5k about 2 years ago, barely even being able to run for 30 seconds when I started. My training for this HM was supposed to start in November. Unfortunately in December I unexpectedly lost a dear friend and the entirety of my training fell to pot. In January I restarted, and really struggled. Whilst I was able to run a distance of 5k, my speed had really declined. 

I decided to raise money for charity in honour of my friend and this sort of spurred me on to keep going. I decided to aim for completion rather than aim to get a good time this time round. I used ChatGPT to help guide my training. I told it all about my feelings, asked it to motivate me and then to give me feedback on each of my runs too, this really helped. I think I overall ran fewer kilometres whilst training this time compared to my last, but it ended up being much more efficient and structured. I did one long run per week, and 2 short ones of around 5k around it when I could. I had a go at fartleks, which were tough but I think I‚Äôll implement them into my future training plans. 

# Pre-race

Annoyingly, in the 10 days leading up to the race I had 6 on call shifts - 3 days and 3 nights, so my taper wasn‚Äôt great, but I reminded myself that all I wanted to do was finish. My nutrition wasn‚Äôt great but it was enough, and the night before I had a big bowl of pasta. Layed out my clothes. I used bib magnets instead of safety pins this year. Double checked my headphones were charged. Chugged down a load of water. 

In the morning, I made an effort to be up early enough to have some porridge and coffee in the morning. I think this was the single best thing I did for the race; I usually don‚Äôt eat before a run but this made such a huge difference. 

# Race

This year I went to the race by myself and had a far less organised start. I half-assedly joined the warm up, then walked toward the start line. When the race started I quickly realised that I was going too fast. Actively had to slow myself down. I wasn‚Äôt very good at slowing down, but I felt okay so I carried on, figured that I‚Äôd just go as much as I could and just walk when I couldn‚Äôt run. 

I kept going to 5k, thinking I felt pretty good. Got to 8, feeling good. Got to the split where the 10k runners broke off and still felt good. I was a little confused when I got to 15k and still felt fine. It was only when I got to 18k where my legs and mind started to struggle, but when I looked at my watch I saw that my time was astonishingly pretty good and realised if I kept it up I might actually beat my time! I got a little watery eyed at that point thinking I‚Äôd made a little deal with my deceased friend that if i could beat my time it meant she was still with me (crazy thoughts I know) you can imagine my determination when I got to the finish at this point. I actually did sob a little when I got to the end haha. 


# Post-race

I got my finishers pack and left straight away, got home and took a shower in time to meet a friend for a massage! It was the most wonderful massage ever. Unfortunately the next day I was back at work hobbling around on my sore legs. But it was worth it. I have raised around ¬£710 for charity, and have already signed up to next years Birmingham HM.

Here's mine. Granted not the worst but considering his history with thoughtless-ness and knowing that I feel taken for granted because of it, it's pretty bad. 

About a week ago after not being asked anyyything about Mother's Day, I brought it up to avoid the ""I forgot"" disappointment. I asked him to make me breakfast and asked him to complete a couple of things off my ""husband to do"" list. Pretty easy, yeah? 

Flash forward to this week, he worked 7 days in a row, 2 of the days after work we went on outings (mom's bday Friday and beach evening with my family on Sat) 
Last night I asked what was on the menu and he said French toast, eggs, and bacon. Awesome, right? 
Well I woke up with the baby, didn't exactly expect him to offer to sleep in since he had worked so much. Around 8 I woke him up because I was hungry and my family was leaving around 11 and thought it would be nice to all eat together. Although in retrospect I could've let him sleep longer, had a small snack, and eaten his cooking as brunch/lunch after family left. Maybe if I would've done this I would've avoided this deeeeep heartache. 

Anyway, I woke him up and the first words out of his mouth were ""coffee"" which I usually do wake him up with coffee when its his sleep in day. But today I felt differently about it.  
I said sure and made him coffee and joked about thanking him for helping me become a mother. I was a touch annoyed but whatever. About a half hour later he made some bacon and asked me to take it out to my family but I let him know that THEY were not hungry yet and grabbed a sliced for myself. Instead of continuing to make breakfast he goes to dilly dally in the garden and when asked what he was doing he claimed I said we weren't hungry so he decided to stop making brekky. Confused I clarified and he continued. Another starving hour goes by and he informs me that French toast and bacon is in the kitchen, I said great and asked about eggs. I have to have protein for breakfast or I crash really hard, he knows this. Another fucking half hour goes by and I walk into the kitchen where I find all the food is wrapped up in foil, eggs included, husband nowhere to be found and he never came back to let me know about the eggs. So I grab a depressing lonely plate and go off to the patio to eat by myself, I bump into him, and immediately turn around to avoid him. I eat alone in the side yard, sobbing because what the fuck? This is how you celebrate or show you appreciation your wife and mother to your children who literally sacrifices her body and mind for her family? This is how you treat, his words a couple days ago, ""the best mother in the world"" Okay cool. 

He comes to find me and he just stares at me blankly the same way he stares at me when he knows he's done something wrong but doesn't know what to say. 

He gives me a weak ass apology after I spell out why I'm upset and then the baby finds us and he basically goes back to normal. I'm visibly upset and now he's just been avoiding me all day? Or if he does come to me he just gives me the same stare. 

In this mix he brings me a garden picked bouquet that I had to force out a smile and thank you for when I really wanted to throw it at him. I wanted to save face Infront of my family and kids. 

The history behind his thoughtless- ness is that he seems to remember dates and events for others (not everyone but still) but not me. In addition to me ALWAYS asking for my presents, planning my own events, asking for reminders of validation. I'm being taken for granted but he swear he doesn't and that he appreciates me. He's the breadwinner and spoils me when I ask for things but I like gestures and actions as affirmations not fucking words or money. Words are fucking stupid if you don't act the way you say. 

He's a good man and this is where he falls short but I just don't know how much I can take. I see my aunts married for 50+ years with men who are amazing but fall soooo short in this same department and they just seem to ""content"" not genuinely happy. Is small thoughtful gestures something all wife's and mothers need?  Idk. 

This is obviously an explosion of years of resenting him for this and I just don't know what to do. Or what to say? He knows I feel this way because I've expressed it in the past. And it's always ""sorry I'll do better"" 
I do think he's on the spectrum but it's no fucking excuse to not use your phone to remind you to do shit for your wife. Especially when you know it's a thing and you promise to do better. ",2,1746995417.0,Parenting,21,0.67,False

also - be extremely careful at avoiding ALL sources of caffeine at the beginning, this is crucial. but then don't get fixated. i like dark chocolate a lot so i still eat it when i want to (but i keep at 70%), of course not daily lol, but it's very easy to get trapped into anxiety and it's useless, especially when the whole point of quitting coffee is to be less anxious. 

how i did it - i tapered with 2 days with decaf and that's it. successfully managed to quit coffee at my second attempt. not because i'm great or anything but because i was kind to myself. i did lots of physical activity, read and slept on repeat, i slept so fucking much the first month, but it was ok, and all went well. 

during my first try, it wasn't really the best time for that, i had just started uni and also i kept drinking tea. HERBAL TEAS ARE YOUR FRIEND and they're so much fun there's literally so much variety.

***Present Day***

The air in the garage had gone stale days ago. Or hours. It was hard to tell anymore. Time didn‚Äôt flow here, it curdled. There was blood on the concrete again. His blood, mostly dried now, flaking when he shifted. A low hum vibrated from somewhere in the walls. A fuse box? A fridge? Maybe his own body buzzing, waiting for the final act.

Dean sat slumped against the wall, wrists raw from the ropes they‚Äôd stopped bothering to retighten. His body had long since stopped resisting. His mind, though, his mind was sharp. Clearer than it had ever been.

‚ÄúI used to think a confession was something you earned,‚Äù he said aloud, the sound thin in the dark. ‚ÄúLike if you hurt bad enough‚Ä¶ or bled long enough, someone out there would let you explain.‚Äù

His voice didn‚Äôt echo. The garage swallowed it whole.

‚ÄúBut no one‚Äôs coming. Not really.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt sure who he was talking to. Maybe Maya, if she ever found this place. Maybe his father. Or maybe just himself, the version of him that still thought prayers meant something.

He let his head tilt back against the wood paneling. The scent of motor oil lingered, like a ghost from his childhood. His dad had always smelled faintly like that. Oil, sawdust, and that damn hand wash.

‚ÄúThat place was my sanctuary,‚Äù Dean murmured. ‚ÄúDad made it that way. Scripture verses taped to the rafters‚Ä¶ tools lined like soldiers‚Ä¶ coffee cans full of shit we‚Äôd never use but couldn‚Äôt throw away.‚Äù

He could still see Owen hunched over his workbench, sanding something slowly, deliberately. *‚ÄúThe world needs order, Dean. Even in chaos, build something.‚Äù* That voice echoed louder than his own.

‚ÄúFunny how I‚Äôve torn down more than I ever built.‚Äù His lip cracked as he smiled ironically.

His fingers brushed against the floor beside him, where the cement met a line of faded masking tape. He remembered a time that, as a boy, he‚Äôd helped Owen mark off tool zones like it was sacred geometry. He‚Äôd been so proud. So eager to learn.

He closed his eyes and saw the reservoir again.

Caleb standing shirtless at the edge of the rocks, grinning like they were invincible. ‚ÄúCome on, man. Don‚Äôt be a coward.‚Äù Dean had stood frozen, the summer heat blistering his skin, terrified of what waited beneath the surface.

‚ÄúI keep going back to that day,‚Äù Dean said softly. ‚ÄúCaleb just‚Ä¶ jumped. Like nothing could touch him.‚Äù His eyes opened, glazed with memory. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt afraid of the fall. I was afraid of the change. Of who I‚Äôd be after.‚Äù And Ethan had known that. Had looked into Dean like he was a cracked window and slipped right through.

‚ÄúEthan saw a boy aching to be remade and gave him a purpose that felt holy.‚Äù Dean let the silence stretch.

‚ÄúBut it wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù His throat tightened, but he didn‚Äôt cry. Not anymore. ‚Äú*‚ÄòThey‚Äôll call it faith if you do it with your eyes closed,‚Äô* Dad said once. I thought he was being poetic. Turns out he was warning me.‚Äù The breath he released was shaky, but light.

‚ÄúI wanted to belong so badly‚Ä¶ I handed Ethan the matchbook and asked which one to light.‚Äù He looked down at his hands, how callused those knuckles were. All the broken skin and scars. The tools of a zealot.

‚ÄúI thought if I obeyed enough, fought enough, bled enough, I‚Äôd earn love. God‚Äôs. Ethan‚Äôs. My father‚Äôs.‚Äù He laughed, low and bitter. ‚ÄúI spent years mistaking quiet violence for devotion. Righteousness for control. And I let them make me a blade.‚Äù His voice cracked at the last word.

‚ÄúBut I know better now.‚Äù He shifted, one leg stretched out, the other bent at the knee. Blood had dried around his sock line. ‚ÄúI used to beg. For mercy. For Maya. For something holy to interrupt all of this. But tonight?‚Äù He sat straighter and leaned into it.

‚ÄúNo more.‚Äù

A breeze slipped in through the crack beneath the garage door. It carried dust and the smell of night rain.

‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôve remembered who I was before all this. Before Ethan. Before I put on the black suit and called it armor.‚Äù His voice softened. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve remembered how even saints bleed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was just a kid who wanted to keep his dad proud. Who believed in something bigger. Who believed people were mostly good‚Ä¶ because that‚Äôs what *Owen* taught me.‚Äù He touched his chest like, maybe, his father was still there somehow.

‚Äú*‚ÄòWe‚Äôre all just trying to do better than we did yesterday.‚Äô* That‚Äôs what he said. *‚ÄòThat‚Äôs all the Lord really asks.‚Äô*‚Äù Dean smiled for real this time. It wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable, yet it felt true.

‚ÄúI can believe that again. I can believe that the younger version of me, who was scared, eager, and blind, wasn‚Äôt evil. Just desperate.‚Äù He paused, ready to drop the weight he‚Äôd picked up years ago. The one he‚Äôd accepted in his father‚Äôs garage years ago.

‚ÄúAnd I can forgive him.‚Äù

It came out as a breath, but rushed out like the wind.

‚ÄúNot because he earned it‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to carry him in shame anymore. That version of me‚Ä¶ he brought me here. And here‚Äôs where I finally saw it all.‚Äù His hand rested with steadiness now.

‚ÄúThe whole crooked empire. The men behind the curtains. The bloodstained pulpits.‚Äù

He looked toward the ceiling, picturing where Owen had once hung a model airplane. It was long gone now. Dean‚Äôs breath came quickly and raspy as he spoke.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret the fire, everything needed to burn. I only regret I had taken so long to light it.‚Äù

He thought of Caleb. Of the way they used to pass notes in seminary, draw swords on napkins, and laugh in the quiet way boys do, carefully, with reverence they didn‚Äôt believe in but couldn‚Äôt break.

‚ÄúI wish I could tell Caleb I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat I miss the boy who snuck Oreos into fast and testimony meetings. That I hope he‚Äôs okay, wherever he is.‚Äù He let his eyes close again. This time, he pictured Maya.

‚ÄúAnd I wish Maya had never followed me into this mess. But part of me is glad she did. Because she saw me, not the bruised fists or the church-boy grin. Me.‚Äù The quiet returned. It stayed for a long time. Like even time was waiting with him. Then, in what could have been seconds or an eon, he heard a breath of motion. A step. Dean didn‚Äôt flinch.

1kka9ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/NonTheisticPaganism/comments/1kka9ri/blasphemy_in_writing_when_literature_gets_you/,Blasphemy in Writing: When Literature Gets You Kicked Out of Heaven,"So, I just finished Insane Entities ‚Äî and let me tell you, it‚Äôs like that one friend who shows up at your dinner party, slams a bottle of whiskey on the table, and proceeds to tell everyone they‚Äôre living a lie. One reviewer called it blasphemous, while another kindly suggested the author should ‚Äúreturn to Jesus.‚Äù Because, you know, that's always the solution when a book makes you uncomfortable ‚Äî tell the author to go back to church. But hey, that‚Äôs what makes literature fun, right? If you‚Äôre not shaking the table and making people uncomfortable, you might as well be writing how-to manuals.

Insane Entities is the kind of book that doesn't just ask you to think about existence, it smacks you upside the head with it. Imagine throwing horror, religion, quantum physics, and existential dread into a blender with some random philosophy books that haven‚Äôt been dusted off in centuries. The result? A narrative that might make you question whether you‚Äôre alive or just a simulation of someone‚Äôs terrible dream.

But that‚Äôs not what made it blasphemous, no. It‚Äôs the fact that the book doesn‚Äôt politely ask religion to take a seat at the table. It kicks religion‚Äôs chair and proceeds to break open every last one of its contradictions, leaving the whole system standing there looking confused, like someone just spilled coffee on their favorite holy book.

Now, blasphemy in literature isn‚Äôt exactly new, right? Case in point: Children of the Alley by Naguib Mahfouz. The man decided it would be fun to take religious history, give it a little twist, and then tell the whole thing in the form of a fictional Egyptian alley. Unsurprisingly, Egypt wasn‚Äôt thrilled about this, and the book was banned. But hey, it‚Äôs not really blasphemy if you‚Äôre just asking the big questions like, ‚ÄúWhat if the divine story we‚Äôve been told isn‚Äôt the whole story?‚Äù Mahfouz wasn‚Äôt mocking religion; he was just poking it with a stick to see if it would react. Spoiler: It did.

And then there‚Äôs The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie. Ah yes, the book that led to an actual fatwa against him. Rushdie wasn‚Äôt just tossing around blasphemy for fun; he was actively engaging with the sacred, making it awkward and challenging for people who had never questioned the stories they‚Äôd been told. It‚Äôs almost like the guy wanted to start an intellectual bar brawl, but in the classiest way possible. He made readers wonder: ‚ÄúWhy do we believe what we believe?‚Äù And then he ran off with the answer in one hand and a flaming sword in the other.

But wait, it doesn‚Äôt stop there. Let‚Äôs talk about The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov, which brings in Satan himself, because why not? It‚Äôs a story where the devil strolls through Moscow, causing chaos, but in the most charming way possible. It‚Äôs as if Bulgakov was saying, ‚ÄúHey, here‚Äôs some religious satire, some Soviet criticism, and a dash of romance. Enjoy!‚Äù The book has it all ‚Äî it's got absurdity, humor, and enough existential crisis to fill a philosophy class. Also, I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs something in there about ‚Äúfree will,‚Äù which, to be fair, sounds like something you should check before making major life decisions.

But back to Insane Entities. Why does blasphemy matter in literature? It‚Äôs not about disrespecting religion ‚Äî it‚Äôs about asking difficult questions. It's about peeling back the layers of what's considered sacred and, you know, making you squirm a little. So, while the book definitely rattles some cages, it‚Äôs not doing it just for shock value. It‚Äôs challenging the very notions of existence and spirituality. And really, isn‚Äôt that the job of great literature? To make you think so hard your brain feels like it‚Äôs been through a washing machine?

So, here‚Äôs the big question: Are we willing to let literature be the thing that disrupts our carefully crafted beliefs? Or do we want to keep it all nice and tidy in a box labeled ‚ÄúThings I‚Äôve been told since childhood‚Äù? I‚Äôm just saying, if you‚Äôre looking for a book that‚Äôs going to make you rethink everything you thought you knew ‚Äî and probably make a few people angry along the way ‚Äî Insane Entities is definitely the one.

I still live with my ex, and it‚Äôs a shitty, complicated situation. He goes through these cycles of trying to ‚Äúmake things right,‚Äù promising change. Yesterday, he said he‚Äôd clean up, make breakfast, have coffee ready for me in the morning for Mother‚Äôs Day. Things he never did when we were actually together. And I let myself believe him.

Of course, I woke up to the usual mess. No breakfast. No coffee. Just me, expected to take care of everything again. I felt disappointed and told him so. I expressed how hard it‚Äôs been to always be let down like this.

That‚Äôs when everything spiraled.

He got angry and started doing the dishes aggressively. Slamming things around until he broke stuff. Then he got in my face, yelling, and eventually shoved me into the kitchen table. After I was in the ground, he stood above me screaming some more.

My daughter was in the shower during all this. I tried to go be with her, and he followed me. My best friend had recently told me how important it is to document situations like this, so I tried to pull out my phone to record. He grabbed it and threw it in the toilet. After I retrieved it, he kept pushing me, trying to get the phone again.

Then he slammed me to the ground. He wrapped his arms around me and started lifting and slamming my head against the wall and bathtub. I was screaming. My 4 year old was screaming. Begging him to stop. And eventually, he did.

I managed to get outside and called my best friend‚Ä¶the only person I could think to reach out to. She lives in Texas, I‚Äôm in California, so it‚Äôs not like she could come help, but she was scared and called the police after my phone died.

The cops showed up in full force. Fire department. Ambulance. It was honestly a blur. I told them I was fine, but apparently I had blood all over me. 

He was arrested even though I didn‚Äôt press charges. I guess that‚Äôs just something that they do..

Now I‚Äôm just here‚Ä¶ in pain, emotionally wrecked, and not sure how to move forward. I feel so embarrassed about everything.

1kka7t1,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1kka7t1/my_first_mothers_day_was_in_1997/,My first Mother's Day was in 1997.,"My boy was two months old. His bio father, C, left early the previous evening and didn't return until mid afternoon that day. it wasn't the first time he'd done so. He told me that he had gone to different flower stands that morning, looking for the perfect gift. A guy at one stand had told C he had just the thing and had to go get it. He said the guy stuck him watching his flower stand for hours and hours and ended up coming back with nothing after all. The entire story sloppily fabricated, because he knew that if i questioned it too hard, all he had to do was bully me into silence.

Still, I couldn't resist the opening i saw to snare C's lie. I said... you had plenty of flowers then. Surrounded by them. in a stand. for hours. No flowers for me? Did you at least cover your tracks by getting me some fucking flowers? He was empty handed. He knew he'd been caught but he didn't acknowledge it. 

Fast-forward: This Mother's Day has been very different.

My current husband, N, made me breakfast and coffee and then set out to the back yard to install some lighting in prep for a party we are having next month. My son, G, now 28, popped his head in the door on his way to work to wish me a happy day and let me know he would be back later to take me to dinner. N adopted G 13 years ago. We are a family. 

No betrayal for me to manage today, no disappointment to push down in my gut, no tears to hold back. No sharp clash of mixed feelings to cloud the joy I've always found in motherhood. Just family and loyalty and an appreciation i can feel all the way to my guts. 

We're even going to visit C's mom today. Despite my past issues with C she's always treated me like a daughter and done right by my son and her other grandkids. We might see C in passing. It would have upset me years ago but there's no way he can faze me now. 

I hope today that every mama or mama's child who's been through it has found some peace and love today. ",12,1746994510.0,self,1,0.94,False

1kka7cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kka7cv/aita_if_i_break_up_with_my_boyfriend_because_his/,AITA If I break up with my boyfriend because his farts smell so bad that it makes me go insane?,"I know the title of this post sounds ridiculous and WILD, but this is something that I am genuinely struggling with. So please bear with me.

I (26F) have been dating my boyfriend (29M) For about almost 3 years now. Let's call him Jake. About 6 months ago, we decided to move in with each other. My old roommate moved in with her boyfriend and I didn't want to live with a complete stranger to afford rent, so Jake and I decided that he could move in with me because we both felt that we were ready for that step in our relationship. The first month went fine, but soon, a certain stinky problem started to arise.

You see, Jake is lactose intolerant. Anytime he consumes anything that contains dairy, he becomes extremely gassy. Unfortunately (for me), almost all his favorite foods contain large amounts of dairy and he makes absolutely 0 effort to avoid dairy products. On the contrary, he probably eats cheese every single day of his life because he loves it so much. Meanwhile, I am very sensitive to smell. I can't stand it even if I smell just a little bit of sweat and always wear perfume. I take out the garbage bag of my trashcan even when it's just halfway full because I simply cannot stand the smell of old trash everytime I open the lid. I have fragrance sticks in almost every single room of my apartment and I shower twice almost every single day. I have always been this way. Jake knows this.

In the beginning of our relationship, his gassiness was never that big of an issue because we didn't live together and also couldn't spend the night together that often. Even if he did fart back then, it wasn't that big of an issue because I usually had to go home anyway when his gas problems started, which was usually in the evenings.

However, it has definitely become a big problem for me now. A few months ago, Jake got a new job that allows him to work from home. He will work in our living room at the dining table pretty much the entire day. And throughout that day, and every night, he will quite literally be stinking up the entire place with his farts. For breakfast he usually eats yoghurt along with a coffee with regular milk. For lunch he will usually eat a grilled cheese sandwich and for dinner, if I'm not cooking, he will make pasta for himself with a heavy cream based sauce. And for dessert, he usually has ice cream, or worse, a milkshake. In other words, a recipe for a very, very stinky disaster.

His farts quite literally smell like rotten eggs mixed with decaying corpses. It is by far the worst and grossest smell I have ever had the misfortune to grace my nostrils with. It is absolutely vile and makes me gag almost every single time. I come home from school or work and I can smell his farts through all of my scented sticks. Every time I enter my apartment now, I want to gag and leave again right away. Almost every night Jake farts in bed, making my duvets smell like that disgusting rotten egg smell. One time it was so bad that it had even made me throw up. He even farts in his sleep and the scent of it has woken me up several times. So many times I had to sleep on the couch becuse the smell of his farts literally makes me unable to fall asleep. I have had countless of restless nights because of it no and I just cannot seem to get used to it at all. I have literally lost sleep because of his farts and I have noticed that it's been affecting my school and work performance.

I have tried to talk to Jake about this several times. I have quite literally begged him to either cut down on the diary or to take lactaid pills to reduce his farting. But he refuses both. He said he doesn't like taking medicine and he doesn't want to deprive himself of food that he genuinely loves, because he is a picky eater and those foods are like comfort foods to him. I can't make breakfast, lunh and dinner for him every day because I am quite busy myself, so those are quite literally the only foods that he will make for himself. But this has gotten to a point where genuinely don't like being in my own home anymore because the vile smells make me go insane. I am seriously considering either breaking up with him and / or forcing him to move out if this doesn't change.

So, Am I The Asshole if I break up with Jake because of his farts?

  
EDIT: I forgot to mention this at first, but the reason why Jake doesn't want to take lactaid pills is because he had tried them when he was a teenager but got bad side effects from them so now he doesn't want to take them anymore. He has had bad side effects from most medications that he has taken when he was younger overall so now has an aversion to basically all over the counter medicine because of it. Because of this he doesn't want to try any other brand or kind of pills that could help him with digesting diary products. ",49,1746994477.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,43,0.95,False

***Present Day***

The air in the garage had gone stale days ago. Or hours. It was hard to tell anymore. Time didn‚Äôt flow here, it curdled. There was blood on the concrete again. His blood, mostly dried now, flaking when he shifted. A low hum vibrated from somewhere in the walls. A fuse box? A fridge? Maybe his own body buzzing, waiting for the final act.

Dean sat slumped against the wall, wrists raw from the ropes they‚Äôd stopped bothering to retighten. His body had long since stopped resisting. His mind, though, his mind was sharp. Clearer than it had ever been.

‚ÄúI used to think a confession was something you earned,‚Äù he said aloud, the sound thin in the dark. ‚ÄúLike if you hurt bad enough‚Ä¶ or bled long enough, someone out there would let you explain.‚Äù

His voice didn‚Äôt echo. The garage swallowed it whole.

‚ÄúBut no one‚Äôs coming. Not really.‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt sure who he was talking to. Maybe Maya, if she ever found this place. Maybe his father. Or maybe just himself, the version of him that still thought prayers meant something.

He let his head tilt back against the wood paneling. The scent of motor oil lingered, like a ghost from his childhood. His dad had always smelled faintly like that. Oil, sawdust, and that damn hand wash.

‚ÄúThat place was my sanctuary,‚Äù Dean murmured. ‚ÄúDad made it that way. Scripture verses taped to the rafters‚Ä¶ tools lined like soldiers‚Ä¶ coffee cans full of shit we‚Äôd never use but couldn‚Äôt throw away.‚Äù

He could still see Owen hunched over his workbench, sanding something slowly, deliberately. *‚ÄúThe world needs order, Dean. Even in chaos, build something.‚Äù* That voice echoed louder than his own.

‚ÄúFunny how I‚Äôve torn down more than I ever built.‚Äù His lip cracked as he smiled ironically.

His fingers brushed against the floor beside him, where the cement met a line of faded masking tape. He remembered a time that, as a boy, he‚Äôd helped Owen mark off tool zones like it was sacred geometry. He‚Äôd been so proud. So eager to learn.

He closed his eyes and saw the reservoir again.

Caleb standing shirtless at the edge of the rocks, grinning like they were invincible. ‚ÄúCome on, man. Don‚Äôt be a coward.‚Äù Dean had stood frozen, the summer heat blistering his skin, terrified of what waited beneath the surface.

‚ÄúI keep going back to that day,‚Äù Dean said softly. ‚ÄúCaleb just‚Ä¶ jumped. Like nothing could touch him.‚Äù His eyes opened, glazed with memory. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt afraid of the fall. I was afraid of the change. Of who I‚Äôd be after.‚Äù And Ethan had known that. Had looked into Dean like he was a cracked window and slipped right through.

‚ÄúEthan saw a boy aching to be remade and gave him a purpose that felt holy.‚Äù Dean let the silence stretch.

‚ÄúBut it wasn‚Äôt.‚Äù His throat tightened, but he didn‚Äôt cry. Not anymore. ‚Äú*‚ÄòThey‚Äôll call it faith if you do it with your eyes closed,‚Äô* Dad said once. I thought he was being poetic. Turns out he was warning me.‚Äù The breath he released was shaky, but light.

‚ÄúI wanted to belong so badly‚Ä¶ I handed Ethan the matchbook and asked which one to light.‚Äù He looked down at his hands, how callused those knuckles were. All the broken skin and scars. The tools of a zealot.

‚ÄúI thought if I obeyed enough, fought enough, bled enough, I‚Äôd earn love. God‚Äôs. Ethan‚Äôs. My father‚Äôs.‚Äù He laughed, low and bitter. ‚ÄúI spent years mistaking quiet violence for devotion. Righteousness for control. And I let them make me a blade.‚Äù His voice cracked at the last word.

‚ÄúBut I know better now.‚Äù He shifted, one leg stretched out, the other bent at the knee. Blood had dried around his sock line. ‚ÄúI used to beg. For mercy. For Maya. For something holy to interrupt all of this. But tonight?‚Äù He sat straighter and leaned into it.

‚ÄúNo more.‚Äù

A breeze slipped in through the crack beneath the garage door. It carried dust and the smell of night rain.

‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôve remembered who I was before all this. Before Ethan. Before I put on the black suit and called it armor.‚Äù His voice softened. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve remembered how even saints bleed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was just a kid who wanted to keep his dad proud. Who believed in something bigger. Who believed people were mostly good‚Ä¶ because that‚Äôs what *Owen* taught me.‚Äù He touched his chest like, maybe, his father was still there somehow.

‚Äú*‚ÄòWe‚Äôre all just trying to do better than we did yesterday.‚Äô* That‚Äôs what he said. *‚ÄòThat‚Äôs all the Lord really asks.‚Äô*‚Äù Dean smiled for real this time. It wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable, yet it felt true.

‚ÄúI can believe that again. I can believe that the younger version of me, who was scared, eager, and blind, wasn‚Äôt evil. Just desperate.‚Äù He paused, ready to drop the weight he‚Äôd picked up years ago. The one he‚Äôd accepted in his father‚Äôs garage years ago.

‚ÄúAnd I can forgive him.‚Äù

It came out as a breath, but rushed out like the wind.

‚ÄúNot because he earned it‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to carry him in shame anymore. That version of me‚Ä¶ he brought me here. And here‚Äôs where I finally saw it all.‚Äù His hand rested with steadiness now.

‚ÄúThe whole crooked empire. The men behind the curtains. The bloodstained pulpits.‚Äù

He looked toward the ceiling, picturing where Owen had once hung a model airplane. It was long gone now. Dean‚Äôs breath came quickly and raspy as he spoke.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt regret the fire, everything needed to burn. I only regret I had taken so long to light it.‚Äù

He thought of Caleb. Of the way they used to pass notes in seminary, draw swords on napkins, and laugh in the quiet way boys do, carefully, with reverence they didn‚Äôt believe in but couldn‚Äôt break.

‚ÄúI wish I could tell Caleb I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat I miss the boy who snuck Oreos into fast and testimony meetings. That I hope he‚Äôs okay, wherever he is.‚Äù He let his eyes close again. This time, he pictured Maya.

‚ÄúAnd I wish Maya had never followed me into this mess. But part of me is glad she did. Because she saw me, not the bruised fists or the church-boy grin. Me.‚Äù The quiet returned. It stayed for a long time. Like even time was waiting with him. Then, in what could have been seconds or an eon, he heard a breath of motion. A step. Dean didn‚Äôt flinch.

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù he whispered, ‚ÄúI hope you know I heard you, even when I pretended not to. I hope you‚Äôre waiting somewhere warm. Somewhere quiet. I hope you followed the water.‚Äù

The doorknob twisted. Dean didn‚Äôt move, his eyes stayed on the floor. The hinges groaned open. A shaft of blinding light split the room. He didn‚Äôt shield his eyes or look up to the newcomer.

He just said, steady and calm:

‚ÄúTook you long enough.‚Äù

1kka60h,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kka60h/more_than_just_a_workmate/,More Than Just a Workmate.,"I never meant for it to happen. At first, it was just teamwork, shared coffee runs, inside jokes during meetings, exchanging glances when the boss said something ridiculous. But somewhere between late-night project deadlines and lunch breaks that ran too long, my feelings grew louder.
Last Friday, after everyone else had left, I stayed behind under the excuse of finishing some reports. So did he. It was quiet‚Äîjust the hum of monitors and the occasional sip of coffee. I couldn‚Äôt hold it anymore.
I said his name. He looked up.
‚ÄúI know this might sound out of nowhere, but I like you. I think I‚Äôve liked you for a while now. And if you don‚Äôt feel the same, that‚Äôs okay‚Ä¶ but I had to say it.‚Äù
The silence after felt like a lifetime.
Then he smiled, slow, surprised, and somehow relieved.
‚ÄúI was hoping you'd say that first.‚Äù

1kka5es,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kka5es,My first place of my own,"I have a small living room in a top floor apartment, I have no idea how to interior design though to start pulling things together. I love my green walls, my sofa, the colours of the throw, but now I'm at a loss on what to do next.

Anyone got any ideas on what coffee table, what rug would look good? Is there enough space on the wall with the TV to put photos up? I'm so apprehensive about clutter and things clashing!",30,1746994331.0,femalelivingspace,2,1.0,False
1kka4ya,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kka4ya,Via Nav,"Got Vis Nav yesterday.
So excited to try it out despite all the hate towards the robot. 
Sadly got to say, it is truly a shocking experience.
For the money they charge, it‚Äôs extremely disappointing. Looks like all the hate is justified.
The roller, bin emptying, easy access to filter an overall look of the robot as positive. When it‚Äôs on though, it just doesn‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs doing.
Mapped downstairs, removed as much small bits from the floor yet map is soo not accurate. 
Zoned kitchen. Everytime I try to send robot to clean kitchen, it comes back saying area‚Äôs not accessible. 
It does go to kitchen when I select cleaning in all areas. Sometimes it misses some rooms or literally certain areas in rooms
It just randomly moves around the floor. Goes to kitchen, turns around and goes back to living room then to go back to kitchen again.

We have a pretty low coffee table. Robot can fit apart from the camera. I thought it would know that it‚Äôs too low, yet it always tries to push its way under the coffee table with obvious scratching on the top. Why, like seriously why?
Then again, we have a low profile sofa. I bet it would get stuck there but no, it always manages to get out easily. 

Does it get better? I mean I‚Äôve only done 1 Auto, 1 quick and 1 quiet clean.
Does it start to recognise house a bit better the more you use it?
