1gh3uyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1gh3uyc/things_were_getting_more_and_more_interesting/,Things were getting more and more interesting with that man (part 4),"Ever since that encounter in the library, my mind was trapped by thoughts of him, like he‚Äôd left some invisible mark I couldn‚Äôt‚Äîdidn‚Äôt want to‚Äîerase. Everything about him called to me: his voice, his words, that constant feeling of danger surrounding him. I tried to go on with my life, focus on my studies, see my friends, but nothing distracted me. It was as if everything else had become irrelevant.

One afternoon, while wandering aimlessly through the streets, my phone vibrated with a message from an unknown number. Curiosity got the better of me, and I opened it immediately.

‚ÄúI hope you enjoy mysteries as much as last time. I‚Äôll be waiting for you at our usual caf√©.‚Äù

My heart skipped a beat. I didn‚Äôt know how he‚Äôd gotten my number, but somehow that only made it more intriguing. I tried not to seem too eager, but as soon as I was ready, I found myself walking to the caf√©, barely thinking about what I was doing. When I arrived, he was already there, sitting in a corner with a cup of coffee in front of him, as if he‚Äôd been there for a while.

I walked over, trying to keep calm despite the thrill I felt crawling up my skin. He greeted me with the faintest of smiles, that same smile that seemed to hide something he‚Äôd never say out loud.

‚ÄúYou like your coffee with a touch of sugar, right?‚Äù he asked, sliding a cup over to me like he already knew every detail.

I didn‚Äôt remember telling him that before, but somehow, it didn‚Äôt surprise me. It felt like he‚Äôd always known things about me, little details I wasn‚Äôt even fully aware of myself. I took a sip and looked at him, waiting for him to break the silence.

For the first few minutes, we stuck to small talk, as if both of us were trying to ignore the growing tension between us. But it didn‚Äôt take long before the conversation took a different turn. Almost without meaning to, he began talking about that book from last time, explaining how those ancient authors had ideas about love and attraction that went far beyond the conventional. He said that, for them, a real connection between two people had to be intense, dangerous, something that left you on the edge. His gaze didn‚Äôt leave mine as he spoke, and I felt like his words were meant for me, like he was describing exactly what I‚Äôd started to feel.

Every word he spoke pulled me in further. I felt trapped in his voice, the way he seemed to analyze me, studying my reactions. There was a moment when his hand brushed mine again, but this time, he didn‚Äôt pull away. Instead, his fingers slowly traced over mine, following a gentle path that made my skin tingle. I knew it was intentional, and I knew he enjoyed seeing how it affected me. And, somehow, I enjoyed it too.

It felt like the atmosphere in the caf√© had grown heavier, as if all the background noise was starting to fade. Everything focused on him, his voice, the warmth of his hand. He talked about how most people settle for shallow connections, while he was looking for something deeper, something more dangerous. He didn‚Äôt say he was looking for it with me, but I felt like that was the true implication.

After a few minutes of this game of words and glances, he leaned toward me, with an intensity in his eyes that left me breathless. There were only a few inches between us, and the heat from his closeness made every nerve in my body tense.

‚ÄúYou know this isn‚Äôt ordinary, right?‚Äù he whispered, his voice low and soft, like it was a secret just for me.

I nodded, unable to respond with words. I felt that if I tried to speak, anything I said wouldn‚Äôt make sense. I was caught in that closeness, in the slow rhythm of his breathing that seemed to sync with mine.

For a moment, there was absolute silence, where both of us seemed to be holding our breath. And then, before I could even react, I felt his fingers brush my face, just barely touching me. The softness of his touch made my whole body respond, like I was completely out of control. It was a silent invitation, a challenge, and I realized, somehow, he already knew I would accept.",0,1730463045.0,confessions,0,0.5,False

Early morning, FOB Sharana Afghanistan, Halloween 2011. I was sitting by the ECP drinking a cup of coffee watching the escorted LNs come meandering into the base for their daily jobs. 

Suddenly, a mass of weirdness appeared 200 yards up the road and crested the top of the hill. You freaks were dressed as transformers, Pok√©mon, werewolves, teddy bears, witches and dancing girls. As the two groups neared one another you kids seemed to sense the poor Afghan workers confusion and turned up the volume on the freak show to 11. I could only guess what the Afghans were thinking as you all ran by, screaming and blowing kisses. Their faces were a mix of bewilderment, fear, concern (and a sprinkling of arousal).

I still laugh out loud when this picture comes to mind. Wherever you weirdos are, I hope you're well.

I was curious about few things before traveling to Thailand. As the information online is sometimes overwhelming, I would like to get some personal advices from your experience. 

1. What is the best e-SIM while being in Thailand? - price/quality matter and duration is roughly 3 weeks
2. How much money (in total) do i need to consider having with me? - 1 week i will be staying at my friends house and also an average spender. I am not thinking to throw money everywhere i go. 
3. I am planning to spend few days 3-4 in the area of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, 4-5 days in Bangkok and the rest in the south coastal area. Any personal recommendations? - could be food, places to visit, coffee, shops etc. 
4. Should i be ""afraid"" of getting sick from the street food? I have heard that a lot while discussing travelling to Thailand. I mean, i love eating Asian food but i don't know what they mean by that. 

Also, what is your best personal advice/experience from travelling to Thailand?

1gh3jel,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermiculture/comments/1gh3jel/help_starting_my_journey_in_the_us_mountain_region/,Help! Starting my journey in the US Mountain Region,"OK, so I got the general ‚Äúall clear,‚Äù from the spouse to begin vermicomposting. We have municipal compost but they don‚Äôt take tissues and that bothers my partner because they used to take them, and now we have to landfill /methane them. She‚Äôs really passionate about the methane thing.

INTENDED COMPOST USE:
Tomatoes
Peppers
Flowers flowers flowers
Maybe the small patch of grass we have? 

(Everything is under drip irrigation)

HARDWARE:
1) Hungry Bin! It seems low maintenance and with kids and pets that‚Äôs everything. I‚Äôm buying one new. 

2) Hotbin! My friend scored a used one and doesn‚Äôt want the work. He gave it to me, free.

3) Vitamix ECO 5! Controversial, I know. But it was a gift and it seems to have a limited role. This machine turns hard food items into pulverized, heat sterilised ‚Äúdust‚Äù or powered that can then be more easily composted by traditional means. No bacteria powders or anything are added to this device. 

METHOD:
Soft fruit and vegetable food scraps go right into the hungry bin

Tissues go right into the hungry bin

Hair goes right into the hungry bin 

Hard pitts (mango/avocado/peach) and banana peel tops go right into Vitamix Eco 5 and then that powdered output goes into either Hungry Bin or Hot Bin.

Garden cuttings go into the Hotbin. That‚Äôs mostly the goal of the Hotbin. Any extra garden cuttings that don‚Äôt fit can go to the municipal compost, which is placed in a bear-tight garbage pail that the city services collect every two weeks. 

Chicken bones are powdered by the Vitamix eco 5

Beef/lamb/pork bones (rare in our household)would be placed in the municipal compost bin, to be collected every two weeks by the city services. 

Egg shells are currently collected separately, and, once every several months, when the quantity can be described as ‚Äúabundant,‚Äùthey are fired in the oven at 200¬∞ F for about an hour and then put to an old coffee grinder for true powdering. In the past I amended my soil directly with these powdered shells. I wonder if I can Vitamix eco 5 them and, after processing, add them to the hungry bin. Do worms want them? 

CLIMATE OF AREA:
This is the most stressful part because I‚Äôm not sure how to control for it. 

I‚Äôd like to do as much of this work outside. Preferably in the Riga greenhouse that came with the property when we moved here. This way mammalian pests can be kept to a minimum and there is little to no chance of attracting into the actual domicile.

Summer high: 38¬∞ C/100¬∞ F

Winter low: -28¬∞ C/ -18¬∞F 

Greenhouse winter average temp: 4.4¬∞ C/40¬∞ F 

Greenhouse summer? The space is, at best ambient temperature (see above summer highs) if the skylight and side window are open for venting.

Again‚Äî I‚Äôd like to put the Hotbin and Hungry Bin in my greenhouse because it‚Äôs a good in the winter but in the summer‚Ä¶ that seems deadly.  Right now we use the greenhouse to get nursing plants started and then move them outside when it heats up. But there‚Äôs room to spare. 

FINAL: 
We are REALLY REALLY good at sorting our refuse/ separating types of compostable items‚Äî but I‚Äôd like to keep post compost processing to a minimum. 

What do I do on vacation? Two weeks away and what sort of problems am I looking at?

Can shredding (normal paper) mail be the bedding?

I don‚Äôt really want the composing in the basement or the garage‚Äî they‚Äôre just too small to accommodate a large operation + I live in fear of mammalian pests in the house. It happened once and we just can‚Äôt let it happen again.

Our audience are English learners who come from all over the world who want to consume British content. They‚Äôre the most eager for original British channels.

We expect casual and relaxed tone (as if you are¬†*speaking*¬†with someone, not just reading a text). The video should be in the condition that you intend to do the real recordings in afterwards.

He stayed for his family unit and by extension to make her happy and she trapped him into cycles of abuse that shocked investigating officers remarkably, second only to her commitment to her story that they were both abusive but he was the primary. He reality-shifted to cope and so illegal assault became a baseline he knew he could come with to make it work, reducing and/or accepting it until he had become less and visually more aged for trying

I stayed for being financially trapped (signed a lease with her before the extent of her conditions were made clear, she justified omitting it because she was uncomfortable telling me before later being coached elsewise and covered for by her friend). I was trying to get my life together for the first real time and she wanted to grow up a bit too or so she said. No romance or abstract expectations, more like a 'relationship' agreement that confirmed we were only FWB and she had to keep to it. Cue me being the problem for trying to keep her on track, me being primarily abusive and her only reacting to it. Never mattered that our conversation transcripts showed she'd justify smacking my head off a coffee table because her friend suggesting we wrestle as a joke and me shaking my head no was somehow unclear. More so that I'm not allowed to consider it assault because she ran off to her bedroom to self-harm which she was sure made us even. Do you feel reality shifting too? The main reason I wanted her to get real help after us was she justified sexually assaulting me multiple times (because she wanted to keep having sex after we agreed no FWB just friends) by insisting that because she been assaulted in the past (not by me to be clear) that she was entitled to do it to others.  I even made this clear to her sister who then felt it would be easier to slander me instead of living with the shame

I'm 6 months post-her and we live in the same town. She hasn't stopped trying to smear me and put mutual friends in awkward positions but last night something changed for me, we were both at a pub quiz on different teams but she came to hug a mutual who was sat right behind me. I only noticed for her voice being close and had to make sure I wasn't living some weird flashback but she clearly noticed because another mutual friend of ours (on her quiz team it turned out) messaged me 'innocuously' seconds later asking where I was and what I was up to. I was just done but thankfully the quiz started and it became disqualification-worthy to piss about on our phones.

Ok i need your advice as I've been running a business (online vintage shop) for a tad over 9 years now and will be hiring people. I've already been reading on cooperatives etc on how to do it fairly but this a tad trickier.

The model will be anarchist based where everyone will earn the same, except transportation costs are individual based on needs, if they need a bike, bus or train subscription. I do have private investments as I've just put in personal money instead of business money in renting a space, deposit plus amenities like coffee machine etc, which all will have to be paid back of profit ofcourse. (i get paid by my business so I can not just grab money from the business piggy bank for myself and do not give myself bonuses) After this I want collective agreements with all workers on profit sharing or raises or hiring with the surplus, etc However cash payments will already be split equally amongst staff based on days worked.

Now the first employee that was going to start told me she had to work at least 4 days a week to 'survive'. now I offered her the same my pay for those 4 days which is about 30% over minimum wage. I work 7 on 7, and this employee will mostly be present in the store and make parcels. I will still be doing the majority of work, photoshop, parcels too, store too, purchasing pieces, social media, accounting, clients, inventory management...

So in my mind this is a very good deal as she will get paid the same for about half the workload plus until I could offer a good wage. Also adding besides 20 vacation days, paid holidays i also have mental health days they get paid if they need it.

About the wage, she makes more than me now, plus she lives with boyfriend on full double income and rent here isn't US based, no illness no debt (i have bipolar and sever depression and live alone and I can live well plus pay my medical expenses of the pay) so I don't want to assume but I am pretty sure this pay isn't just above minimum wage but a decent living wage with extra money for fun things and savings. and then bonus of cash profitsharing.

ANYWAY from all people I've interviewed she has the best qualifications and I get under capitalism people want to be paid by age and experience and job switch to earn more. She would be considering accepting lower pay but even then this is leaving a sour taste in my mouth, especially because I know other stores are incredibly capitalist and use unpaid interns and only pay minimum wage for 3 or 4 days a week and expect unpad overhours. So if business would be slow she would 100% not be agreeing lowering both our pay temporarily and later raising + payback missed wages.

It is kind of urgent, and I do have more junior applicants, but I can use her experience and knowledge in setting up the store. i'm asking if I should go ahead with hiring at the wage she wants and just treat her as a capitalist employee, meaning profit sharing will be done with everyone except her. and when business is bad or I find people willing to accept lesser pay (my pay) + bonuses, she will be let go. But then I will be a capitalist.

But at the moment i'm in a crunch deadline for help, i've already replied to all applicants i'll go through their CV and I want to interview everyone too, but absolutely I have no time, i'm in a big depression again while working my business which I already overwork on plus the store setup. So absolutely no time for interviews nor do I have the energy at the moment for also training someone.

**TLDR: first employee wants capitalist conditions and 20% more pay than me for less work and less working hours, business however will be anarchist w equal pay and additional profitsharing, now I'm depressed in time crunch and overworked, no time/energy to interview others, she's the best candidate, should I hire her under capitalist conditions? bc that will make me a capitalist, or is it anarchist to let people choose to be hired under capitalist conditions?**",2,1730461501.0,Anarchy101,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 15, she‚Äôs 13 and it‚Äôs been a while i think she is the wrong person cuz she already has a body count over 7 i guess, she drinks alcohol and smokes. But i thought if I‚Äôll ¬´¬†break up¬†¬ª with her, i would be all alone with no friends. So one day my friend (let‚Äôs call her Jane) went at my house, we were supposed to hang out in my city. She asked if my old phone still works because her parents took her phone for 6 months. i was shocked and asked why, she said because they saw the video of her having sex with a boy. So i gave her my old phone, it‚Äôs iphone se 2 generation. I was sharing internet with her and all that stuff. She said she would use it for 2 weeks. Once we were chatting and discussing the halloween costume and she said she‚Äôd order it on shein. It was a stuff like fake nails for us etc. There weren‚Äôt any expensive stuff. She sent me a screenshot and i saw the android interface and i asked her what happened to my phone and why she doesn‚Äôt use it. She said me she forgot my phone at her mom‚Äôs house and now she‚Äôs at her dad‚Äôs house so she‚Äôs using the phone her friend gave her. I said ok but it was a bit weird. We were going to hang out together in few days and i said she has to bring me my phone back because my mom wants to sell it. She said no problems but the day we met she said she couldn‚Äôt take the phone. In few days we were chatting and i said that me and my mom are getting worried and she can bring the phone to the coffee house where my mom works. I said she can bring it there anytime she wants she just has to say that that is for *my mom‚Äôs name*. She said oh this week i‚Äôm at my dad‚Äôs house, next week. Ok i waited till the wednesday and i asked why she didn‚Äôt bring the phone, it‚Äôs been 4 weeks since i have her the phone. I said i‚Äôm worried and asked her for the screenshot. she didn‚Äôt answer, i thought that it‚Äôs rare whe she has internet so i was just waiting. Next day i called her and i understood she blocked me!! I was really mad because all this time i was protecting her from my mon, like my mom wanted to go at her place and to talk with her mom about it, but i knew she would get lots of problems after it. Next week i took a bus and i knew that her classmates that also were my friends are going to take the same bus so i told them the story and asked them about it. They said they saw her using my phone yesterday so i relaxed a bit because i thought maybe she broke it. But then they said that when my friend brought an iPhone 14, Jane said she wants to buy it too. Then my friend asked her how, and she said she would sell my phone to add the money to her savings. I was so freaking shocked. It was too strange for her to block me and to do it because i had her mom‚Äôs and dad‚Äôs phone number, and i knew where she lived so it wouldn‚Äôt be a big problem for me to contact them. Also her classmates told me that when they asked her why she wants to do it, she said that we aren‚Äôt friends anymore because i‚Äôve got a boyfriend and i started to spend less time with her and to cancelling our meetings ‚Äúi don‚Äôt have a boyfriend‚Äù. I asked the girls to speak with Jane and not to tell her that i am mad but to tell that i sm worried about our friendship (idgaf). The same evening she wrote me and i started to ask her about all the stuff i heard. She started to pretend a victim but i knew she‚Äôs able to do it so i was not kind with her. She said that her friend has the access to her account and that it was her who blocked me. Later she said me that it was her ex‚Äô friends who told her other friend that she‚Äôs dumb and i was treating her like a sh!t, so she blocked me. Then she literally prayed and she asked me to speak with my kom because she‚Äôs scared that if my mom would talk about it with her mom, she send jane living in boarding school. She said that everything that girls said to me wasn‚Äôt true. She said that her parents took the phone because her psychiatrist told to do it for her mental health after she tried to suicide herself. And if her mom amd the doctor would find out this story she would go to the mental hospital. The next day i got my phone back. After 1 months üôèüèªüôèüèª

There were a lot of shitty moments but it‚Äôs already too much. After it i don‚Äôt have any wish to continue being friends with her. Chat, am i overreacting ?",0,1730461289.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.33,False

1gh3c7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/pmp/comments/1gh3c7e/passed_pmp_a_much_needed_win/,Passed PMP - A much needed win,"Hey Everyone,

At the onset, I'm extremely delighted to share my happiness of clearing PMP with all of you. I really mean it when I say that I could t have done it without you guys and this space.

A little background about me. I have around 11 years of experience between management consulting and leading large scale HR Transformation programs for a large fintech organization. As you can imagine I've always been part of managing programs but never really took the effort to learn the fundamentals. I have an MBA in operations and PMBOK was one paper in my curriculum this was back in 2011. Career was getting stagnant and realized the need for upskilling and self-improvement in an ever competitive environment. Okay, enough about my personal stuff and let's get to what matters -

Exam decision:
I took the decision to focus on pmp back in Jan 24. Unawareness of this forum, led me to pay a fairly good amount of money to a bootcamp provider who offered a combined deal - Bootcamp (PDUs) + Exam fee + PMI membership at 680 USD ( Negotiated down from 1100 USD). I'm based out of India just FYI. Went ahead and completed the bootcamp. But life and work tookover kept exam decision at the back of the shelf. Work situation wasn't getting any better and wife motivated me to take the exam and offered to step in and support with things at home.

Exam prep:
So just wokeup one day and decided to schedule the exam on 31st of October to force myself to study. Started the prep on OCT 1st with Rita and notes from the bootcamp. In a matter of 3 days I realized this isnt going anywhere. Google search led me to this subreddit and my gameplan became effective. Used below resources for a span of 4 weeks at 2hours per day:

1. Study Hall essentials: Take my word for this and get this resource. You cannot effectively tackle the exam without attempting practice questions. Went through one full mock, all the mini tests and half of practice questions. Got 73% on my first mock and a range of 47% to 95% in mini tests. Didn't get time to take the second mock. Do not do this on your phone and try to do it on the same laptop you will be taking the test on. Get used to reading on bigger screens. Link - https://studyhall.pmi.org/

2. Third Rock Notes: Another excellent resource for understanding concepts and mindset. Read through the notes and understand concepts. Link- https://third3rockpmp.com/

3. DM Agile and PMBOk7 videos: Very helpful but questions are way too easy as compared to actual exam. Link - https://youtu.be/Zht0-j03NfQ?si=r68UZ52mFP0cScuc
https://youtu.be/tNIHysh2ZW4?si=oI1iLIKlLNeI1ms4

I used to listen to the videos while driving to work. Will get you used to the process of focusing on key pieces of information.

This is it. That's all I used.

Exam Experience:

1. Home test - I took the exam from the comfort of my home. Experience was smooth. If you encounter the infamous video streaming error, disable the firewall. Do test your system a day before the exam. Proctor will check you in half an hour before the exam. Keep books and phone away from your exam space. That's about it.

2. Exam Content - It is hard. Not as easy as DM videos. Expect a lot of questions similar to DIFFICULT ones in SH. Just mindset isn't going to cut it. Knowing core concepts will help as the options are not easy to eliminate with mindset alone. Also had 8 drag n drop questions with straight definition of concepts from PMBOK, one math question about SPI, would say about 40% questions with an agile flavour. I sped through the exam efficiently and finished with an hour to spare. I realised that there's no point revisiting answers to situational questions as overthinking often leads to wrong answers. 

3. Exam Result - if you take the exam from home, results will be mailed to you within 48 hours. I got it within 12 hours of taking the exam. I cleared with AT/AT/T. 

This was a much needed small win to help me get out of the slump to greater opportunities out there. Couldn't have done it without you guys. Please feel free to ask me anything. 

Miscellaneous tip - I took pre-workout instead of coffee ahead of the exam. Helps with attention span :).

1gh35r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1gh35r7/swallow_the_mct_oil_pill/,Swallow the MCT Oil pill,"There's something darkly comic about watching PMC girlies shell out hundreds for ""wellness coaching"" while getting fatter and more neurotic by the day. The boutique fitness industrial complex has them convinced that salvation lies in $40 green juices and trauma-informed yoga. Pure ideology, obviously.

What none of these lifestyle optimization schemes want to acknowledge is the brutal simplicity of metabolic health. While coastal millennials perform their little ritual dances of ""mindful movement"" and ""intuitive eating,"" a simple truth remains buried: fat makes you thin.

Not just any fat - we're talking about MCT oil, the preferred supplement of Eastern European women who understand that true metabolic efficiency requires a degree of elegant brutality. The same babushkas who survived communism didn't maintain their imposing figures through portion control and ""joyful movement."" They understood that pure fat consumption is the skeleton key to metabolic superiority.

The contemporary wellness discourse is saturated with a particularly American brand of moralistic hand-wringing about ""clean eating"" and ""food freedom."" Meanwhile, the obesity epidemic accelerates unabated. You almost have to admire the perversity of it all - the more we obsess over ""healthy lifestyle choices,"" the sicker and fatter we become. A perfect expression of late-capitalist dysfunction.

MCT oil offers a way out of this maze of contradictions. Unlike the elaborate pseudoscience of contemporary diet culture, it operates on pure biochemical logic - medium-chain triglycerides bypass normal fat digestion, flooding your system with ketones whether you like it or not. There's something almost Soviet in its pragmatic efficiency.

The typical objections are tediously predictable: ""But isn't that much fat dangerous?"" This from people who unquestioningly consume industrial seed oils and processed soy products marketed as ""plant-based protein."" The level of cognitive dissonance would be fascinating if it weren't so depressing.

What the wellness traditionalists can't grasp is that we're well past the point where conventional approaches to ""health"" have any relevance. We're living through a metabolic dark age that requires radical solutions. A tablespoon of MCT oil in your morning coffee isn't just biohacking - it's a small act of resistance against the forces of metabolic decay.

The real red pill isn't some complicated protocol of intermittent fasting and zone 2 cardio. It's embracing the kind of metabolic brutalism that your great-grandmother would have recognized immediately. Everything else is just cope and theatre.

But don't expect the wellness industry to acknowledge any of this. There's no profit in simple solutions, and certainly no room for the kind of metabolic realism that MCT oil represents. Better to keep the masses chasing ever more elaborate ""lifestyle designs"" while their insulin resistance quietly accelerates.

So yes, swallow the MCT oil pill. Your mitochondria will thank you, even if your SoulCycle instructor won't. Just don't come crying to me when you can no longer relate to people who think overnight oats are ""nourishing."" Some forms of alienation are simply the price of metabolic enlightenment.

You want to know what's actually transgressive in 2024? Rejecting this medicalized approach to body modification in favor of something as elegantly brutal as pure fat consumption. While the Ozempic zombies are micromanaging their Wegovy doses between crying jags about ""food freedom,"" the MCT oil enjoyer simply dumps a tablespoon of medium-chain triglycerides in their coffee and achieves basically the same metabolic effects without becoming a human guinea pig for Danish pharma bros. There's something almost heroic about its simplicity.

*Discussion of MCT oil consumption for entertainment purposes only. If you need a trigger warning for dietary fat, you're beyond my help anyway.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",2,1730460591.0,redscarepod,2,0.63,False

Thanks to your stories and experiences shared in this community, I began educating myself and not giving up. I wrote to Mayo Clinic (as a kind of last ditch effort) this summer and got seen virtually by an internal specialist and scheduled for further testing this fall. 

First, Mayo Clinic Jacksonville was amazing!  There was no bad experience in 3 days of appointments. 

My young son was seen (unrelated) this fall at a pediatric congenital cardiologist (very good one) who asked about my history. He has a bicuspid aortic valve, caught inincidentally. In discussions, he told me he treats POTS patients and doesn't believe in TTT for diagnosing POTS, or rather maybe it's unnecessary and unreliable. I considered canceling MAYO.  I decided to stay the course and see it through. 

Over the years, I've been to the ER a lot (about 4x in the past year), seen 2 cardiologists, 2 neurologists, 1 neuromuscular specialist, a migraine specialist, a pulmonologist, primary care, and multiple labs. The migraine specialist aside, I've never really felt heard completely or that I was closer to an answer. 

I had a really bad summer (June and July). I may have been sick before this, early in June, which kicked off really bad symptoms, consistent symptoms. I felt awful. I was still getting no answers. I started to memorialize more of my history and take information from here, articles, and medical journals to help myself. I have been better over the past few months. Slow process since August. I drastically changed eating (kinda was forced to), increased sodium, electrolyte intake, ate mainly whole foods, swam as much as I could tolerate, started taking colder showers (had to), stopped coffee (had to), stopped smoking, started eating small frequent meals/ snacks, and stayed away from the heat/humidity as much as I could. 

At Mayo, I saw a cardiologist and neurologist, had a TTT, among other tests.  I haven't had a follow-up yet with referring DR, however neurologist confirmed POTS. From the looks of the TTT, I may have hyperadrenergic.  Something I was not exactly expecting, is perhaps an issue with mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), although would explain some things. I would say the majority of my labs were within range and most of my stuff ""checks out"". Still waiting on some results. 

If you are still in the diagnostic process, I just want to encourage you to continue to advocate for yourselves, you are probably not crazy, and if you can, see someone who has a clue about dysautonomias and/or POTS.",1,1730460472.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

It's been like that for a long time. I've told her time and time again, mom you have got to tell people no. It's okay to tell people no. 

Just this past week I invited my mom out for coffee. Right as my mom was coming to meet me, my brother, last minute, called and all but demanded mom to babysit his kids again (he's been just dropping them off without consideration for mom's plans and dad working 3rd shift).

Instead (!!!) she tells him no! And it gets better guys. It was like word vomit and she's telling me this over coffee that she told my brother that she was unavailable for the foreseeable future. He's been inconsiderate and inconsistent and she'll call him when she's available.

**[Memory Transcription Subject: Sokvous, Yotul Metallurgical Expert]**

**[Human Standard Time] - November 14, 2136**

‚Äú...This FTL drive design will never properly function! There is too much transitive spin inductance, and the plenum cavity flows will be uneven!  As a result, these structural supports will tear themselves apart!‚Äù Pokim railed at Tevest, pointing a talon at the drawing of the magnetic plenum supports in question.

*No, they won‚Äôt. I ran the numbers through the simulations with Rochelle three times, and the new materials meet the design specs Dr. Baklund requested three weeks ago. Ductility, stiffness, cross angular resistance, all of it.  The material trials confirmed the simulation results last week. The constants in question are right there‚Ä¶*

Tevest and Pokim had spent the last two hours transcribing the design blueprint in question onto the whiteboard, which now had several notes written over the design in red, which Pokim added, and also other notes in blue, which Tevest had added.  Numbers and equations in both colors filled the empty margins of the board.

‚ÄúThe quantum shunt diameters are such that the neutron spin vectors will be unstable, as Nedjarus‚Äô first rule tells us!‚Äù Pokim was nearly screeching with indignation, his talons jabbing at a particular equation on the whiteboard.

I noticed the slight grimace on Tevest‚Äôs face, at the mention of Nedjarus.  

*That calculation is beside the point.  The one that compensates for the effect you‚Äôre concerned about is on the other side of the board!*
  
Tevest‚Äôs quills were also half raised, belligerently.  ‚ÄúI think the drive depicted here will work; Gerfnel‚Äôs Equations state that the margins are wide enough in the plenums here, here, and here for the flows to transfer well within the limits, without overdriving the neutron spin compression ratios. That is enough for the subspace phasing fields to be reinforced in the proper shape without ex-harmonic collapse, and the drive will function per the design specs, and it will function well, Pokim.‚Äù Tevest moved his paw directly under the equation in question.

I recalled Gerfnel‚Äôs Equations were stable, but no longer found to be acceptable in the academic circuit.

*I‚Äôll give you that, Tevest. It‚Äôs a solid analysis. Now, you just need to make this upstart bird-brain see it.*

Igor came up behind Kyle and I.  We were seated on the break room couch, which the two of us had dragged into the main hangar bay, where the ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù had been taking place.  Igor reached into our bowl of popcorn and grabbed a handful, popping a few of the fluffy white kernels into his mouth.  ‚ÄúHow long have they been going at it?‚Äù

*Too long. Not long enough.* 

I was conflicted; Did I have time to watch them continue with the argument?

Kyle checked his watch. ‚ÄúAbout three and a half hours, now.‚Äù He grinned at the two of us. ‚ÄúSit down, and enjoy the fireworks.‚Äù

*They are certainly loud enough to be compared with fireworks. So much sound, and flashing light‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúThey haven‚Äôt worked out the problem, yet?‚Äù Igor asked, leaning against the arm of the couch nearest to the popcorn bowl. He reached into the bowl for another handful of kernels. I grabbed a pawful for myself.

‚ÄúNo. They‚Äôve been going back and forth about Nedjarus vs. Gerfnel for the last 20 minutes.‚Äù, I nearly growled with frustration.

‚ÄúHave you told them?‚Äù, he queried again, looking at the two of us.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I said, continuing in a low tone. The two combatants were too busy hurling high energy mathematics at each other to notice our quiet little conversation on the side.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Igor searched our faces, his eyes darting back and forth, from Kyle to myself and then back to the two arguing at the white board..

‚ÄúThey are the experts!‚Äù

---

We let Tevest and Pokim continue to argue and pontificate about FTL theory for another two hours.  Neither one of them was ready or willing to back down.  Sadly, Dr. Baklund arrived and spoiled our fun. 

‚ÄúWhat are the two of you arguing about?‚Äù, she asked them evenly, as she wandered into the hangar.

Pokim replied, ‚ÄúThis design. It will never work!‚Äù The bald, burnt Krakotl turned an eye in her direction.

‚ÄúOh? What leads you to that conclusion?‚Äù Her eyebrow raised as she asked the question.

Pokim finally explained. ‚ÄúThe field inductance raised in these containing magnets will add enough torsion to bend the aluminum struts used to keep the wave plenums aligned.  Once that alignment is breached, The containment field will release the flux, and Boof!  Rapid unscheduled disassembly!‚Äù  He threw the marker at the whiteboard to emphasize his point.  Turning to Tevest, he inquired snidely, ‚ÄúWhat does your degree and professional experience say about that?‚Äù

Tevest responded calmly, avoiding rising to Pokim‚Äôs obvious bait. ‚ÄúI think the engine will maintain integrity. All the phase flows are within tolerance, and I think the fields will support a reasonably sized craft.  Is there a foundry where we could build a prototype, Dr. Baklund?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo need. We installed this exact design in the Odyssey for its initial flight tests.  We used titanium for the supports, instead of the aluminum you are thinking of, Pokim. The flux profiles change considerably as a result.‚Äù 

*‚Ä¶and if you had bothered asking me, I would have told you that 4 hours ago!* I bit my tongue, and kept that thought to myself.

‚ÄúWhat level of spin force were these calculations based on?‚Äù Dr. Baklund probed, waving at a set of equations on the left side of the board.

‚ÄúWe went with the base assumption of the reactor at 50% capacity, so‚Ä¶  250 arc radians per second?‚Äù Tevest answered, directly.

‚ÄúRunning at that energy level is too conservative.  We push our reactors to 80% or even 90%, driving the phase rotations between 320 to 350 arc radians per second.  We‚Äôve calculated that this new alloy that Sokvous produced last week will allow us to build plenums able to support flows of 700 arc radians per second, without failure. The resulting subspace phase field should support a ship twice the size of the Odyssey with margins to spare, and do so at half the internal engine size.‚Äù  

*The human approach to problem solving is more evident here than in any other field I‚Äôve seen so far. They are always pushing the limits‚Ä¶*

‚ÄúTevest helped with the new calculations. So, we need that reactor to produce a 150% energy output per unit size improvement to reach that goal. It‚Äôs part of why you are on the team, Pokim.‚Äù  She paused briefly, as Pokim gaped at her, beak open in astonishment.

*I‚Äôm glad someone appreciates my work.  That particular alloy took weeks to find, even with the new property determining algorithm. Days of hot work in front of a blast furnace, singing my fur over the crucible.  Hot metal burns in my nostrils from getting too close, to smell the mix of molten metals.*

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs contra-indicated from my experiences!‚Äù, Pokim nearly squawked. ‚ÄúThose parameters have been worked in, for at least 800 years in the Federation.‚Äù

‚Äú800 years?  And no new innovations in all of that time? What have Federation scientists been doing?
Anyway, it‚Äôs not relevant. We‚Äôve shown that these equations need to be re-evaluated. But that‚Äôs a ‚Äòlater‚Äô problem.‚Äù Dr. Backlund focused her binocular eyes on the whiteboard.

*This is amazing. The Federation scientists would have hemmed and hawed about the equations for a week, if not a month, back on Aafa, before throwing the whole thing out the window.*

‚ÄùRight now, I‚Äôm more concerned about the limiting size of this reactor, and how we can make it smaller, with twice the power output. Antimatter provides the next level of energy production, by orders of magnitude!  But, only if we can harness it in a way to bleed the energy out slowly, instead of a single instantaneous release.‚Äù Dr. Baklund probed inquisitively, pointing to the sizable reactor in the drawing. Very few notes had been marked on it.

Dr. Baklund continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a pretty reliable system so far, but if you have notes, write them up, and I‚Äôll look them over.‚Äù  She took a long pull from her rather large coffee cup. ‚ÄòFastest Mom in the Universe‚Äô was inscribed on its side.

‚ÄúWhat else have you been working on?‚Äù

---

After Dr. Baklund‚Äôs redirect, Pokim and Tevest spoke briefly, and then each moved back to their respective working areas.  Pokim went back to his perch in the hidden corner, whistling to himself about containment fields of another sort, while Tevest walked back toward his desk. He spotted us, sitting on the couch, eating the last of the popcorn, and came to join us.

‚ÄúI saw you were enjoying the ‚Äòshow‚Äô. I do enjoy a spirited argument. I was waiting for Pokim to ask about the alloys, because that feature of the engine surprised me when I first saw it, too.  I laid the numbers out for him, but he did not pick up on the different constants used in the fourth Gerfnel Equation. That should have clued him in. None of the improvements I‚Äôm considering will be possible without your alloy changes, Sokvous. They are revolutionary!‚Äù

*Maybe the Gojid is not so bad after all, for an ex-Fed academic type.*

Fast forward to the last quarter of 2024, and that sum of money, excluding liquor, can still get me through the day comfortably. Note: not including booze. Booze can easily run into the four digits.

1gh2ng2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ThePlanetIsDyingNow/comments/1gh2ng2/understanding_the_korean_lack_of_selfpreservation/,Understanding the Korean Lack of Selfpreservation - please help me to understand the mindset here,"I am wondering if anyone here can help me understand something that I have been seeing a lot of over the past years here that doesn't make sense to me as a westerner. I've noticed a lot that people here seem to lack a sense of self-preservation. I've wondered about this for a while, but I saw another prime example of this yet again today when a woman allowed herself to be trampled instead of simply moving out of the way like I did, I just needed to ask so this makes more sense to me.

I went to one of those classic coffee chains I frequent daily to get my morning coffee. When you open the only door to the shop, to the left is a stainless steel metal counter. It is flush with the door and there is no way to stand in front of it without blocking the door. Of course, this is where the establishment logically chose to put their one and only touch screen. So if you want to order coffee, or wait in line to do so, you must block the only doorway.

I went in like I always do, ordered my coffee from thus said touch screen as I always do, and then stood at the coffee pick up area to the right of the touch screen as I always do. When you stand at the pickup area waiting to pick up your coffee, there is now exactly one person width between where you are standing and the floor to ceiling wooden bookcase filled with purchasable seasonal merchandise which is stupidly placed flush with the right side of the only cafe door, effectively walling it in to create a narrow little corridor to get to the only door which would give any fire inspector an aneurysm.

It was here at the coffee pickup area that I was standing when a woman in a white coat entered the coffee shop clutching a crisp new ‚Ç©50,000 note wanting to order coffee. The barista was extremely busy. The cafe was practically full and she was currently working on a delivery order that appeared to have about a minimum of ten coffees in it, all paired off in plastic travel bags filling the counter awaiting their driver as she continued to make the rest of them.

The woman seemed clueless and just stood there in front of the touch screen she was not using, gazing around it, holding her bill, waiting for the barista who was making it very obvious that she would not be coming over to address the woman as she was now juggling several new tickets, mine included, and keeping her attention on the drinks she was still trying to prepare.

This continued for several uncomfortable minutes. The barista was so busy being the only employee with a backlog of orders, but this woman was absolutely determined and just stood there staring at the barista. Every once in a while she would glance impatiently at me and I don't think she understood that I had simply used the touch screen like you're supposed to and was just waiting for my order. I wasn't waiting for it to be taken. 

After about five or ten minutes, a bunch of people entered the store together, pushed past the woman who was still blocking the only doorway, and sat down filling two of the three remaining tables in the busy cafe.

The group was still just sitting down, talking to each other, as the barista began yelling from behind the counter for them to get out.

I heard a few very firm ÎÇòÍ∞Äs! from the barista and the two guys who came in last, big beefy guys, began sassing back something at her in korean, but got up to leave the cafe as ordered.

They both walked behind me to leave and I instinctively moved further right to give them both room to pass. The korean woman on the other hand, would not move. She refused to move so they began to try to push past her since was still standing there in front of the door, blocking most of it.

I've never actually seen anyone kicked out of a cafe before, so naturally my curiosity got the best of me and I had openly turned to watch them leaving so I saw all of this unfold:

It was here when everything went from 0 to 60 in a split second. The two beefy guys got into some strange dominance thing about who would get to go through the door and exit first. They both tried to push through it together, but with the woman in white still blocking most of it, there was only enough room for one of them to squeeze past her at a time.

I watched as they stood side by side as both of them wanted to push past the woman and get out the door first but there was simply no room for them both to do this side by side.

This is when things got really creepy. All of a sudden their eyes glazed over and it's like all higher thought was gone. Just pure, dark instinct as they turned to face each other, pressed their foreheads against each other's, squared their shoulders and puffed themselves up to make themselves look as big as possible, and began pushing each other back and forth using just their foreheads, and then joining in with their upper bodies as the fight progressed.

They stood facing each other, foreheads touching, terrifyingly blank eyes glaring into each other's, just pushing each other back and forth grunting wildly. The guy on the right (from my pov, facing the door) shoved the guy on the left with his forehead and upper body, sending him violently back into the bookcase which swayed and nearly fell over multiple times, merchandise flying, shelves collapsing, and then the guy that was just shoved pushed back. 

Now, as soon as I saw this start, my selfpreservation/survival instinct kicked in and I immediately rushed to the back of the store to watch from a safe distance against the back wall, safe and out of the way. The woman in white on the other hand simply didn't move at all! She just kept standing there, frozen in place as the guy on the right was shoved into her butt and back, bumping her into the counter. 

If I were her, as soon as I felt someone hit the back of me, I would have fled. Gotten out of the way. Not her. She just stood there moaning and crying and making dramatic noises as they repeatedly shoved each other back and forth like this for several minutes, each time crushing her more forcefully than the last into the stainless steel metal countertop she was willfully standing in front of. Never once did she try to escape. Just doubled over the counter moaning and crying and making dramatic noises. 

What I want to emphasize here, is that the first few shoves from the guy on the left weren't that powerful, like mock shoves, she wasn't pinned or trapped. She just chose to continue standing there and taking more and more of it from the back as it got more and more forceful.

Eventually though, after several minutes more, it ended up with her collapsing and curled up on the floor in the fetal position wailing as the barista continued to scream and now was on the phone with the police.

Long story short, the two guys sat back down at the tables waiting for the police to arrive, which they did in three cop cars followed by an ambulance for the woman who was still on the floor moaning and crying.

My point is, this was not some old weak ÏïÑÏ§åÎßà that couldn't get out of the way. This was a stubborn woman probably not much older than myself, very fit and mobile. No mobility issues keeping her from being able to move. There was absolutely no reason for her to not move instead of just keep taking it for several minutes as the fight escalated. 


Why did she do this???? 

Why did she just stand there moaning instead of just stepping aside??? 

I mean if she took one step to her right, where I had been standing originally, she would have never had any of this happen. It's like she wanted an injury and just stood there stubbornly.



And as I said, this is just another example. I've seen this kind of thing happen a lot in my years over here. 


 On ÌùëÏÇ∞ÎèÑ, while waiting for the ferry, there was a group of 15 bicyclists all lined up with their bikes waiting to get onto the ferry for the mainland.

A young foreign man had been waiting with his backpack for the ferry and quietly sitting against one of the poles on the dock with the backpack on his lap.

This is a long story in itself, but basically an ÏïÑÏ£ºÏî® showed up minutes before the ferry began boarding and wanted whatever this guy had in his backpack. He forcefully grabbed the backpack off of the guy's lap which the guy refused to let go of, his arms still in the straps, and they began doing this rather comical ballet dance around the dock together, both pulling on the backpack and neither letting go of it. The ÏïÑÏ£ºÏî® had enough dancing after a few minutes and let go of the backpack with his right hand so he could start smacking and slapping and then pounding the foreigner in the head repeatedly trying to get him to let go of it.

Instinctively, as soon as the confrontation had started, I had immediately removed myself from the situation and was now standing a safe distance away watching this all unfold from safety.

The fifteen bicyclists, however, were all like deer in headlights, standing there with their bikes in front of them as if they were shields, but still refusing to move to safety while these two threw punches and threw each other around mere inches away.

Inevitably, the foreigner and the ÏïÑÏ£ºÏî® got really physical when neither would give up and the young foreign man actually tossed the ÏïÑÏ£ºÏî® into the bikers and their bikes. Instead of finally scurrying away to safety when they saw the foreigner grab the ÏïÑÏ£ºÏî® by the upper body and begin to violently push him into them, they all just kept standing there. Now, three were on the ground holding their shins or other various body parts making dramatic noises from the impact they watched coming in shock.

They didn't even get up after this to try to get themselves to safety. They just stayed there, glued to the spot. My mind boggles just thinking about it. They just stood/laid there, depending on their condition, unmoving. Frozen.

The fight escalated further, and the foreigner actually picked up one of the collapsed koreans' bikes and threw it at the ÏïÑÏ£ºÏî®.

One of the craziest things I had ever seen in my life. The story goes on, more punches were thrown. Things tossed, people injured. Violence. Yada yada yada, but point being, none of the koreans tried to escape or even move so that they would not be injured or injured further by the obvious melee inches away.

Not even once they were hit.


I have plenty more examples like this, but this post is already past tl;dr status so I don't know how many people even made it this far but I'm trying to make this as concise but detailed as I can to get an accurate answer because this is really beyond my understanding and flies in the face of my very survival instincts.

He's talked about wanting to fix staffing, make Starbucks truly feel like a third place again, simplify the menu, etc. But until now, he's been pretty quiet on what exactly that means.

He's already announced the elimination of the alternative milk upcharge, and the removal of Oleato and iced energy drinks from the menu. But during the call, he mentioned quite a few other things too:

>We're also making a commitment to grow from within by identifying internal hires for 90% of our retail leadership roles.

\-

>\[W\]e're planning to host a store manager conference in 2025.

\-

>We plan to bring back condiment coffee bars in all our cafes by early 2025.

\-

>We also plan to complete the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewers in all our company-operated locations by the end of fiscal year '25...

\-

>\[W\]e will continue to scale our investment in Siren equipment and Siren Craft processes to improve the in-store experience for our partners and customers.

\-

>So we're working to improve sequencing with a new algorithm that enables on-time mobile order handoffs and supports our four-minute throughput with quality being our goal for cafe customers.

\-

>And over the coming months, we plan to take steps to better separate mobile order pickup from the cafe experience.

\-

>We're also investing in our customers with an intent not to increase menu prices at company-owned and operated stores in North America through fiscal year '25.

\-

>\[W\]e'll begin to prioritize serving coffee in ceramic mugs for customers who choose to enjoy their coffee in our cafes.

\-

>We're also beginning to review and revise our cafe designs to bring back more comfortable seating and amenities and to ensure our stores are a place where customers want to sit, work and eat.

\-

>\[W\]e're reducing the frequency of discount-driven offers that have proven ineffective, diluted our premium positioning, overburdened our baristas and detracted from a consistent customer experience.

\-

>\[W\]e are gonna be piloting some new approaches on how we set up the labor model...



Everything below this are responses to questions during the Q4 earnings call, so they're not so much specific actions, but I think they expand more on what exactly he means by things like ""fix staffing.""



>'\[H\]ey, is there any way to simplify the customization that we provide. Can we put in some guardrails on this, so that it's not out of hand?'

He was phrasing this one as common feedback he heard from baristas. He agreed with it seemingly pretty strongly, saying just before it, ""And so, I couldn't agree more, frankly."" Hopefully that means no more nightmare orders with 100 pumps of insanity.

>I want to make sure that the teams are staffed to win every transaction so that when somebody comes in, they walk away saying they had a great experience time and time again. And I also want to have a scenario where our baristas feel like they have the ability to give a great experience.

\-

>\[B\]y the way, the menu simplification is both in beverage and food.

\-

>And then, I also think we \[need to\] have some pricing architecture tied to guardrails to ensure that we end up with no surprises for, frankly, anybody on what was the price of what they just built. And then also, that we can execute it consistently every time.

\-

>But we are definitely not gonna be moving at the speed you probably saw over the last two years.

I think (hope) this means we won't be seeing any crazy deviations from the soon-to-be-simplified menu anytime soon. They'll still definitely be introducing new drinks, but nothing like the introduction of Oleato.

>The furniture that we have, the materials that we choose. I love \[that\] our designers are talking about making sure we bring back the layers, the texture, the warm\[th of Starbucks\]. Those are the things that are really important.

\-

>We're also after less than four minutes for POS to the handoff.

\-

>\[W\]e're gonna be bringing back to is bringing the Sharpies back to our baristas...

\-

>\[O\]n the mobile order side of things, I want to create a separate area where it's clear, so you know your drink is ready.

\-

Most of these sound like pretty decent changes, except for the fact that he seems dead-set on hitting that <4 minute time everywhere. If you're curious, he mentioned it fifteen (15) times during the call.

At one point, he says, ""'\[T\]he customer experience will not exceed that of the partners' experience.""

Firstly, I already asked if she had anything on after our class last time we spoke but she said she had to go into work but she was annoyed because she wasn‚Äôt supposed to be in on that day. Also I don‚Äôt know if she is into women or not. She knows I am but hasn‚Äôt mentioned any dating history or basically anything about her sexuality.

I‚Äôm worried if I do what I was planning to, which was ask if she wanted to get coffee after class, she will do what I‚Äôve done so many times and not realise that the other person is asking me on a date. However, I‚Äôm scared of being any more direct than that especially when I don‚Äôt even know if she is into women.

1gh2gdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1gh2gdm/how_did_you_overcome_social_anxiety_here_is_my/,How did you overcome social anxiety.  Here is my story:,"There was a time when I couldn't order coffee in a store. But fast forward, I have done so many things, spoke at international radio, have acted on an YouTube show that has over a million views, and have lead team of 10 employees under me at my work. How I got here?

1. I started working on it when I hit rock bottom and stopped caring about living. When you reach rock bottom, only way you can go is up because you have nothing to lose. So I started thinking, why do I care so much about what other people think, I have a right to live too and be here. Who cares, I will die someday, and they will too. life is short....so what if they think I am awkward or think lowly of me. It's not the end of the world. I am not dying if they look down at me or laugh at me.
2. I started being self compassionate. When my body would react with anxiety and my face would turn red...I would take deep breaths and keep telling myself, this will be over soon, it's just another person. I will be fine...it's okay. I practiced making eye contact...specially try in low stake situations, strangers that I will never see again probably, so it didn't matter what they thought. Say it with me, ""who cares if they think I am weird.""  Be your own biggest cheerleader, and start celebrating for putting effort!  You have survived!
3. The root of it is low self esteem. You are putting others on a pedestal. So you need to level the fields by knocking them down a few notch (only in your mind) and pulling yourself up. How you do that? When you see someone, think, they too must have anxieties. What kind of anxieties do they have? Think of how flawed they are as human beings. They also go to bathroom, and have different issues. They must also have embarrassing stories and afraid of being embarrassed like you.  Try to shift your focus on them, and feel empathy for their issues, feel the pity, feel the compassion and focus on making them feel comfortable and helping them out, and making them feel at ease.¬†
4. Pull yourself up by affirmations. I am not joking, I used to stand in front of mirror straight up with a superman pose, and used to tell myself, I am smart, intelligent, charming, curious about other people. I have amazing things to share, and people love hearing from me. I love to hear from other people. I love to learn about them, and find common grounds. people really like me, and I really like people.¬†

I kid you not, it helped every time...and I learned to make great first impressions (I am still working on learning to deepen relationships). I did great in my interviews, and people really like me.¬†

5. Realize the truth, that you are not the center of the universe. People care more about themselves and their mistakes than they do with yours. They forget about your embarrassing moments faster than others. Also think well of people, that everyone is rooting for you, no one is looking for you to fail.¬†

6. Push yourself out of comfort zone. The more you do it, the more courageous you will become, and you will learn to look to those as reference points, and small interactions won't feel so painful to you. I spoke at an international radio show, with shaky voice, have spoken at school tv interviews. Face your biggest fears. Then if you do good, you will be look back at those and say, you know what, I have done greater things and have done fine. If you do bad, you will look back and say, I have faced bigger embarrassments, if I can do that, this is nothing.¬†

7. Constantly learn about social skills. Find a mentor whose social skills you admire and try to act like them. fake it till you make it. observe. etc.  From one friend I loved how she made little day to day events as adventure when for me, things would seem so mundane.  From another friend I learned her bubbly personality.

So yeah, it gets better, but not without effort.

Edit: Is there a megathread of how people overcame social anxiety and the strategies they have used?   If not, I hope mods create one.",4,1730457853.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

Sober since 2018

Quit smoking about 2.5 years ago

I ride about 250 km a week as a bike messenger. 

Diagnosed with severe adhd in september.

Mediction:
progestin only pill (5 months)
Rittalin 15mg (2 weeks)

My main concern right now is excessive urination during the day and night. I wake up about 4 times at night to go to the toilet. With the last two trips it feels like low grade period pain or mild burning sensation in the bladder region. I don't have this feeling during the day.
Excessive urinating is going on for years, this weird sensation started about 2 weeks ago. 
I don't think it's UTI, i had it before and it was unbearable.

I got ultrasound of my abdomen 3 years ago, everything was fine.
Got kidney test and ultrasound in spring with the specialist (my doctor found hematuria and some proteins in my urine, sent me for some more tests), everything was fine.

Are this symptoms concerning and what should I say to my doctor?

The other issues I have in the pelvic region and test I have done:

1. Diarrhea on most days in the morning. I go to the toilet 2 or 3 times. Also farty in the evening. 
Had colonoscopy done cca. 2 years ago. They found nothing wrong.
I do have mild hemorrhoids. And sometimes tingly sensation in anus, that goes away in a day or so.
I am planning to quit coffee, maybe it will help with diarrhea (I drink one cup in the morning). 

2. Genital herpes, quite small on labia.

3. Before progestin pills, I had painful periods. They were heavy in the first 2 days and then almost nothing for another 2 days. I don't have periods for the past 5 months.
Gynecologist found a cyst (maybe 2, don't remember), said nothing to worry about. He suggested i maybe have mild endometrosis. PAP smear test is probably negative (didn't get a call back after 5 weeks).

4. At night I get this annoying tingling sensation in the clitoris region. I have to put pressure on it, otherwise I can't fall asleep. It's going on for years, before bike messenger job, if anyone think it's related. 

5. Forgot to add low back pain for years. Got mri, found mild degenerative changes, but nothing worth mentioning. My posture is also problematic. 

Any idea what is this all about, it's quite annoying really. Anything I should mention to my doctor? I don't want to come off as a hypochondriac to the doc. Is it possibe this is somehow psychosomatic or just in my head? 

Other tests done in the beginning of october (for adhd, to see if I can get medications):

Kidneys are fine

Liver is fine

Thyroid normal

1gh2dfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gh2dfw/aita_for_being_a_creep_to_the_woman_that_i_like/,AITA for being a creep to the woman that I like?,"This is long, sorry. There's a TL;DR at the end.

So, this all happened last night, and I‚Äôm still processing the whole mess. I (40M) have really bad social anxiety, and I‚Äôm short‚Äîlike 5'2‚Äîso confidence isn‚Äôt exactly my strong suit. I struggle to interact with others to the point where I haven't had any romantic relationships, haven't even kissed a woman. I don't know how to flirt with someone or anything like that.  I usually keep to myself at work, mostly doing my job and avoiding much small talk. People don't talk to me either, they just ignore my existence unless they HAVE to interact with me, but there‚Äôs this woman, ""Lily"" (28F), who‚Äôs always been incredibly kind to me.

Lily is one of those genuinely warm people who seem to be nice to everyone. She remembers little things, asks how I‚Äôm doing, and actually seems to care about my answers. Over the past few months, we‚Äôve had more little chats by the coffee machine, and she‚Äôd even make inside jokes with me. For someone who‚Äôs been pretty lonely, I started to look forward to those moments, probably way more than I should. I tried not to read into it too much, but I couldn‚Äôt help thinking that maybe, just maybe, she liked talking to me as much as I did to her. 

I just get so happy everytime I see her. She usually waves at me and says hi everyday (no one else has ever treated me this way) and initiates conversations with me. She's also kinda touchy - once, she say next to me during lunch and our shoulders were kinda touching. She didn't move away. Also, one time she kinda brushed her hand through my hair while talking to me. She has put her hand on my shoulder too and I still think of that everyday. She makes life worth living.

Recently, she invited me to a work outing. I was shocked‚Äîno one usually asks me to these things. I almost said no, but she seemed so enthusiastic that I convinced myself it was okay to step out of my comfort zone. So last night, I went.

At the bar, I felt like a fish out of water, so I decided to grab a drink to ease my nerves‚Ä¶ then another‚Ä¶ and another. I don‚Äôt drink much, so this was probably not my best idea. Lily noticed I was drinking a bit and started chatting with me, trying to include me in conversations, even pulling me out to the dance floor. I felt on top of the world - I couldn't believe that *I* of all people, was dancing with her. For once I felt like I belonged. Then, we got back to the bar and chatted more, while I got more drinks for her and myself. 

She laughed at something I said (I think it was ""first time I left my apartment for nonworking purposes"") and I took it as her laughing *at* me. So, I took a few shots of vodka. Then, it all went downhill. I remember giving her weird ass compliments like ""I love your beautiful collarbones"" and ""I could watch you type all day"". 

She was just awkwardly laughing at them. My drunk brain somehow thought that this meant she was into it. I tried to tell her that I liked her, but I said that she was good at ""humaning"" instead. Then, I leaned in and tried to kiss her, before falling off the chair and to the floor. I could barely get back up, but she helped me.

She said that I was too drunk, and promised to take me home. She called an uber, and it got more embarrassing. I got car sick and vomited during the ride, thankfully the driver managed to pull over in time. Lily was still being nice, she literally rubbed my back while I was puking my guts out and told me that It's all gonna be okay. She walked me up to my flat, hugged me goodbye and told me to take care.

Now it‚Äôs the morning after, and I feel like absolute garbage. I‚Äôm hungover and can barely even look at myself in the mirror. I think I got an alcohol poisoning, I keep vomiting water. 

She was just being kind, and I probably made her uncomfortable. She didn‚Äôt seem upset, but I can‚Äôt shake this horrible feeling that I crossed a line and creeped her out. She probably only talked to me because she thought that I was a lonely old man, and now she thinks that I'm a creepy lonely old man.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I apologize? Try to act like it didn‚Äôt happen? Or is that just going to make things even more awkward? She‚Äôs one of the few people I actually like at work, and I‚Äôm terrified I just ruined everything.


TL;DR: Got way too drunk at a work outing because I thought it‚Äôd help me be less awkward around my crush, Lily (28F). Ended up giving her bizarre compliments, tried to kiss her, fell off my chair, and then threw up in front of her on the way home. She still helped me get back to my place and hugged me goodbye.

coffee is my lifeline and my life and my soul. don't speak to me till I've had my coffee!! haha! I will be an utter cunt till I've had my bean juice!! haha. I live in a constant state of burnout and ganjover. haha! fuck you till I've had my coffee!

but really though i love the smell and the taste (i have sugar and oat milk). I love the warmth in my evil little mitts. I love the option of having a second coffee later on hehe",8,1730456798.0,evilautism,6,0.91,False

They have four and the fifth is on the way. They always ask me to borrow them some basic groceries(eggs, coffee, etc...) saying they will give me money when their salary arrives, which hasn't happened so far and we have lived on the same floor for over four years.

I don't understand the basics of their thinking. Their every day is a struggle, and therefore they make more kids to struggle with them. On top of all, they call it love. I think they are emotionally both crippled and immature. If you love somebody you won't expose him to pain. ",28,1730456531.0,antinatalism,7,0.95,False

But I found that it wasn‚Äôt cleaning some of the plaque, so I switched to an electric tooth brush. 
Now I‚Äôve noticed that my top teeth is receding ;( but I have no idea why, any tips? 

I do not smoke or drink, brush twice a day and floss everyday. I do drink no sugar soft drinks and coffees every day. ",1,1730456522.0,Dentists,0,0.99,False
