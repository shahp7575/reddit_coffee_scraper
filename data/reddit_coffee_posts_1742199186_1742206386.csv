Do you have a question about how to use a specific piece of gear or what gear you should be buying? Want to know how much coffee you should use or how you should grind it? Not sure about how much water you should use or how hot it should be? Wondering about your coffee's shelf life?

Rick has hyped up Nico’s casting choice with a tweet along the lines of (and I’m barely paraphrasing here) : “we were casting Nico and Ngl I got legit chills”.

The last time he did this was for Annabeth…

Again, I don’t mind diversity if it’s meritocracy, as a person of color myself but I really don’t want Nico to be Nico Patel or something because being part of queer community + person of color ticks two boxes for the showrunners. 

Fingers crossed, hoping season 2 turns out good or at least watchable. 

I didn’t even dislike the first one till episode 3 but when I started to fall asleep during 4 and 5 (I’m not an early sleeper and I have coffee towards the end of my shift late evenings) I started to actively loathe the show and the folks defending it and calling me racist or sexist or whatever-ist to further bad writing/casting decisions. 

Would love to hear your thoughts. ",0,1742205117.0,PercyJacksonTV,5,0.5,False

Bitcoin is following technical levels perfectly, and today’s order book confirms strong liquidity zones.

📌 Key Observation:
For those watching TradingView, we bounced perfectly from the $82,000 buyer zone—a bookmap reaction. I personally entered a position there and will now watch for further reactions at key levels.

⸻

📉 Order Book Breakdown (Bookmap Analysis):

🔹 Buy Orders (Support Zones):

✅ $83,000 – $83,200 → ~700 BTC buy orders

✅ $82,500 – $82,800 → ~1,000 BTC buy orders

✅ $82,000 → Strongest buyer wall, ~1,500 BTC

🔹 Sell Orders (Resistance Zones):

🚩 $85,000 → The “mystical zone” of major resistance

🚩 $85,200 → The liquidation point of a massive short position (previously spotted in an earlier post!)

🚩 $87,000 → Strong sell-side liquidity—this is where price could squeeze today

⸻

⚡ Market Outlook & Trade Plan:

	•	If BTC holds above $83,000, a retest of $85,000 – $85,200 seems likely.

	•	Above $85,200, we should see a short squeeze towards $87,000, triggering stop hunts.

	•	Watching for reactions at $85K—if the level gets absorbed, we’re pushing higher.

“Definitely. Big things to come in more than way. What is the best way to contribute to this community?”

Reply from u/potlimitcrypto

“Step 1: Buy a bag! 🙂
Step 2: Spread to your networks. 
Step 3: Think of ways to grow Kendu in your locality.

Liquidity and volume on Eth and generally onchain vol for memes across the space is low right now, so Kendu's focus is on building an IRL presence and becoming a lifestyle/crypto brand. While social presence/dominance is important, it's not easy to make conversions in the current market. Now is the time to bring in colleagues, family, friends, and extended networks who might be interested in crypto. Kendu tends to attract go-getters and doers, so the highest value new holders are the ones who ask questions like you, ""How can I contribute?""

""We don't gamble, we work"" and ""You Kendu It"" which underpin the Kendu ethos make for very accessible branding, they've made their way to coffee, energy drinks, sports branding, various merch, beer, and even an events company. 

There is an infinite plethora of opportunities to grow Kendu and your own wealth the more you get stuck in and see the long term vision.”

Either studying way too much and burning out or (more often) just doing absolutely nothing until panic mode kicked in before exams.

Last semester I got fed up and tried to figure out why I kept failing at this. Here's what I realized: I was making studying way too complicated.

My accidental discovery came when I got super busy with my part-time job and could only study in these weird 30-minute chunks between things. Turns out those short, focused sessions were WAY more effective than my old ""I'll study all day Saturday"" approach (which really meant 6 hours of procrastinating, 2 hours of actual work).

Here's the stupidly simple routine that's actually working:

1. **Two 30-minute focused sessions per day.** That's it. Not 8 hours. Not even 3 hours. Just two 30-minute blocks where I'm actually 100% focused.
2. **At least one session is in the morning.** My brain works better before noon. I fought this for years trying to be a night owl because it seemed cooler.
3. **I quiz myself constantly.** Making flashcards and practice questions feels like more work initially but saves SO much time later.
4. **I study in completely random places.** Coffee shops, park benches, the laundromat — turns out changing environments regularly helps me remember stuff better.
5. **I keep a streak going.** Having a visual reminder of my study streak is weirdly motivating. I use [SyncStudy](https://www.syncstudy.app)(https://syncstudy.app) to track this and it's become like a game I don't want to lose.

Please let me know if I should put spoilers on things !*

I thought turning 30 would magically fix me. Turns out I’m worst than ever. And I’m fcking cognizant of it all. 


I absolutely KNOW purging in the shower so my guests won’t ear me is absolutely insane (not to mention disgusting). I’m totally aware having only coffee till I almost pass out isn’t healthy, I’m pretty sure I’m giving myself a stomach ulcer but I came to love the pain and nausea, because it means eating will be impossible. 


Ever since I was a teenager I’ve been vaguely aware my relationship with my body and with food wasn’t very healthy, and that most people could eat in front of others and weren’t absolutely distraught by eating « unhealthy food » and resorting to purging every time they did. But I thought I was just « naturally slim », not taking into account all the loops I had to jump through to stay this way. 
For most of my twenties I was either vegetarian, not eating carbs, not eating sugar, not eating processed food, high on c0ke, or just plainly not eating for days (in my head it was because I was stressed out or busy, or concerned about the environment or my health [yeah, the irony isn’t lost on me] and being skinny was just a cool side effect). Sometimes I would spend months not thinking about any of it at all, and I thought all was fine and dandy and there never was a problem at all, and I was just being dramatic. After all, I never even was underweight ! And when I was 25 and starting to realize something was a little wrong I thought that I would just grow out of it, and that I would turn 30 and be happy in my body, living my best life and thriving. But now I just want to go back to the life I had then. 


These last few months have been absolutely awful, I’ve lost almost all control in a lot of areas of my life and I’m back full force into *the behavior*. And for the first time ever I’m considering I might actually be sick, and not just *wEiRd WiTh fOoD*™️ or doing it for attention (even though no one ever knew I struggled), or whatever. I found a weight chart from my teenage years and my current gw is the one I was when I was SIXTEEN. I wake up at night with the urge to weight myself. I’m thinking about leaving my long term boyfriend so I can focus on loosing weight (obviously there’s other issues in the relationship, but I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT).


I’m terrified of getting old, my body is changing and I don’t like that at all, it’s awfully triggering (even though I absolutely know 30 is still young). I’m terrified having kids would wreck my body, I just want to move out of our house in a tiny studio appartement and go back to be my happy little disordered self alone. And I KNOW IT’S INSANE. I now know I’m using *the behaviors* as a crappy bandaid I’m sticking on a broken leg. But I don’t know how to stop, I’m not even sure I want to *get better*, a part of me just want to surrender fully to it even though I know it would fuck up my life to a degree.

So... This is my second try to post this. For some reason my earlier attempt never saw the light of day. This will also be my first Reddit post ever. If it doesn't appear this time either, it might also be my last.

I recently bought a DF-54, which elevated my game a lot. My espresso journey started a couple of years ago with my pico, which is now my ol' reliable espresso maker. I am not ready to part ways with it yet -emotionally or financially- so I thought I should upgrade it with some... flair.

Mainly I wanted my little portable espresso maker to look more like the true manual espresso maker that it really is. So a stand seemed like the best option.

Unfortunately, I am currently left with a DF-54 size hole in my ""fun budget"".  
After some thought, I decided to build my own stand.

I also had to do some woodworking for the first time in my life!

We had a friend who basically ruined her own life the moment she left.

She used to run a beauty business here, and I used to go there—until I found someone who treated me better.

At some point, she got into all those ""female empowerment"" movements, which started to show in certain awful comments she made towards me, without me even asking for her opinion (but there’s only one that really matters here).

I was going through a rough time with my health and had to postpone an appointment with her. Once again, her stuck-up attitude kicked in, and she made unsolicited comments, specifically criticizing me for taking medication that I am legally required to take due to my autoimmune condition. Let’s just say that if her goal was to make me feel even worse, she nailed it. I never bothered to set foot in her place again because of that.

At some point, she left without even saying goodbye to me or my husband. He was particularly sad about it, and that was the moment I started resenting her for her selfishness and for not valuing the friendship we had.

Guess what? The marriage went south, and they split up, but somehow, she stayed over there.

Regardless, we invited both of them to our wedding. She was actually one of the first to say she’d come (not even trying to hide that fake enthusiasm, especially for an event that, let’s be real, she never actually wanted to attend).

Out of nowhere, she started reaching out to me twice to invite me to her retreats. Coincidentally, I was genuinely unavailable on both occasions. But let me just say—I wouldn’t have gone anyway, especially if it meant paying (her last business was already bad enough; was I really going to give money to someone who was a terrible professional in my eyes?! 🙄).

For some reason, she kept talking to me, and the problem was that my husband kept insisting, “Be nice!” … And I was too nice, to the point that he was happy because “we were reconnecting.”

Surprise: she later claimed she couldn’t come to the wedding because of financial reasons (yeah, right), and neither could her ex-husband. Sorry, but this is a textbook example of how they were incapable of reciprocating the friendship we offered them. My husband disagrees, but in my eyes, they simply didn’t value our friendship enough to even try to meet us individually later.

In fact, she came back the following month and invited me to her book launch. She barely gave us any attention, and her ex-husband, who was also there, was straight-up rude. He looked at us with disgust and contempt.

Needless to say, I didn’t buy her book. First, because it wasn’t free. Second, did she even deserve that kind of importance from me after the way she treated us?!

She left again, and once more—not a single message, no coffee meet-up, nothing. So now I ask: why the hell did she even pretend to be excited about our wedding?!

Months later, the topic came up again, and I not only found out that my husband didn’t actually want to go to her book launch, but he also blamed me for “being nice because I wanted to.” I lost it and finally unloaded everything I had been feeling. What I told him—and honestly, he deserved to hear it at that moment—was: “I was nice because you asked me to, for absolutely nothing. All I got was her contempt—and now yours.”

Eventually, we talked things through, and he admitted that not only should he have said something to her at the time, but also that he pushed me into an uncomfortable situation where I had nothing to gain.

In the end, I removed both her and her ex from my social media—first, because after showing their true colors, they don’t deserve a place in our lives. And second, because I don’t want to be around when her half-baked business inevitably starts going downhill (she can pretend all she wants, but statistically, most businesses don’t even make a profit in the first five years).

The thing is: should I have spoken up sooner? Towards her or my husband? AITA of this story?",2,1742202367.0,venting,2,1.0,False

Both of us lost parents in similar ways, our views on life are so close, hobbies, you get the idea. Our first few dates we spent 3-4 hours just talking and got emotional at times. First time I’ve ever connected with someone like this. Romance was definitely a lock and key situation too, perfect. 

Well, I’ve been noticing things for a week now that she’s just got a LOT going on in life right now along with things from her past she’s dealing with emotionally and mentally. So I saw it coming, but we are talking today over coffee about her not being in this anymore, mentally and emotionally not being able to give me what is needed when dating. She initiated it. 

Really freakin sucks, but I get it and I know she’s genuine. She would have just texted me and said goodbye if this didn’t affect her, too. So I’m excited to actually see her for coffee and talk, despite the circumstances. 

Anyways, long winded background. How would I go about shifting gears and keeping her in my life in a different, more platonic way? Main reason I ask is I truly feel like she has one of those personalities that makes people around her want to be better people, I felt so good when I was around her. Good energy. It would be such a shame to date for a month and just go our separate ways, and I’m pretty sure she would be open to just being friends.

It is a global movement fueled by an unstoppable community, real-world adoption, and a vision that goes far beyond blockchain. This is how DeFi becomes the biggest thing on the planet.

Kendu holders are built different. Most crypto projects rely on hype and short-term speculation. Kendu is backed by people who actually believe in it. These are diamond hands and true believers, the kind of community that took Kendu to a $300 million market cap. And that is just the beginning.

Now, here is where things get wild. Kendu is not just a token. It is an entire ecosystem coming to life. Kendu Beer is happening. Kendu Coffee is already brewing. A Kendu Cartoon is in the works. A Kendu Game is on the way. Kendu Jewelry lets you wear the future. And it does not stop there. Kendu is hitting the real world hard with events across the globe, including Kendu Nights in India and massive meetups in key cities.

What makes this different? There are no VC overlords and no central control. This is pure, community-driven innovation. The people building Kendu are not here to make a quick buck. They are here to change the game and create something that lasts. When a viral online army combines with real-world adoption, the result is exponential growth.

The future of DeFi will not be built by faceless corporations. It will be built by people who actually use and believe in the technology. Kendu is leading that charge.

Massive things are ahead. Stay tuned.

Either before or after the contiki I am planning to spend another week across that region solo travelling. 

For a bit of background; 26 Male, my main hobbies on a trip would include:  
\-Finding good food and coffee  
\-Finding a good walking/ cycling trail.  
\-Occasionally finding a good bar/nighclub (not something I would want to do every night thought as I'd probably be exhausted after the Contiki trip)  
\-Meeting new people.  
\-Exploring the cities and exploring nature - I would love to find a good swimming spot or something.  
\-Finding a cool outdoor adventure activity to do.

So far I have explored the options of London, San Sebastian and Barcelona. San Sebastian appeals to me because from the research I have done it looks like there are some great beaches and food. London appeals to me because of the history, the pubs, parks and muesuem and Sport. Barcelona, I might give a skip, just because I have heard mixed reviews about it. I would be interested to get some recommendations on cool cities/ around Spain/Portgugal that people have had a great experience in.

1jd86tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/omad/comments/1jd86tl/third_week_on_omad_progress_report/,"Third week on OMAD, Progress report.","Hi there OMAD people.

In hopes of keeping up the good spirit and reaching my goal I am going to do a weekly report, showing my progress (or stagnation) with OMAD.

My main goal with OMAD is loosing some weight, an to remove the temptation of candy, junk food and sodas throughout the day, due to the simplicity of only eating once per day. Getting rid of my sugar addiction will surely be a wonderful thing!  
Other than that I stick to only water and black coffee both while fasting and during my meal.  
I am choosing not to calorie count, but most days I will just eat a large, homecooked meal with my wife and kids. As I am the one who does most of the cooking at home, I have made sure to increase the size of our dinner Meal a little, to make up for the fact that I now eat a bit more at dinnertime than I used to. Probably about once a week, we order takeout, and I assume that will not be a problem either.

**Overall Stats:**  
**Gender:** Male  
**Starting weight:** 110,0 kg  
**Current weight as of this morning:** 102,7 kg  
**Height:** 193 cm  
**Goal:** 90 kg  
**Weeks on OMAD:** 3

**Week 3:**  
**Starting weight:** 105,2 kg  
**End weight:** 102,6 kg  
**Weight loss week 3:** 2,6 kg  
  
**Monday:** 105,2 kg - 40 minutes of cardio  
**Tuesday:** 103,7 kg  
**Wednesday:** 103,4 kg  - 40 minutes of cardio  
**Thursday:** 103,0 kg  
**Friday:** 103,1 kg -  - 40 minutes of cardio  
**Saturday:** 102,4 kg  
**Sunday:** 102,4  
**Monday:** 102,7 kg

My lowest weight this week was actually 102.0 kg, but for consistency, i only really track my morning weights.

This week was good, with 3 instances of high intensity cardio training, non of which felt problematic, so i plan on keeping up that pace.

Saturday i did end up cheating a bit, as i had both a Limoncello Spritz and a beer while visiting friends, but on the other hand, i am not going to be all to religious about my OMAD. For instance i am going out with a large group of friends this Friday, and i already know i am going to eat for longer, and have both cocktails and beers. It's going to be interesting to see what sort of setback that will be in regards to the weight loss.

Stay safe and praise the One Meal God :D

We didn’t officially date for very long, but I will say we got attached to each other very quickly because we worked together (or at least I did) and we still do. 

At the time, I didn’t have a set schedule but worked 5 8’s. I often worked 50+ hr weeks, picked up extra shifts, over time, call, you name it. Was also during Covid so call outs were unpredictable and staffing was just a mess. 

He did have a set schedule, working 3 12’s, and had kids and their schedule to work around so we even worked opposite weekends. 

Despite the work hurdles, we still found time. Breakfast dates, coffee before work on his kid free days, or I’d bring him dinner and vice versa and we’d spend our short lunch breaks in the parking lot. But he still wanted more time that simply wasn’t possible given our new relationship and the fact that he had kids and I didn’t want to rush the process just because of our mismatched schedules. 

Ultimately, I’d blame myself for the break up. I guess you could say I became a little popular at work. Everyone started knowing my name, wanting to chat, etc. I also had a pre planned ski trip for a week with a group of friends before we started dating that ended up turning into just me and another guy when the other people bailed. I kept in communication the entire weekend though despite my phone almost dying multiple times, but this was the year that Tahoe had a major blackout and dumped like 5 feet of snow in 2 days and there was a gas line outage too. 

However, I understand the optics of the trip didn’t look good. I also understand I didn’t do a very good job of shutting other people down at work who would openly hit on me in the hallway. I know where I failed as a partner, and inevitably he started growing distant and then stupid little arguments happened until he decided he wanted some space and I told him I didn’t believe in taking breaks in a relationship— I wanted to work on things. He however, was adamant at keeping his peace, living a low drama life, and felt that it was too much for him and he could no longer entertain the idea of us and wanted to salvage whatever work relationship we had left. 

I respected his wishes, but informed him I wouldn’t be friends because we weren’t friends before, and I’d be respectful if we ran into each other, but I was going to likely avoid him— and we did just that for 2 YEARS. We’d see each other in the hallways and I’d look down, or he’d look away. We acted like strangers, not like 2 people who had dated for months and saw each other naked. If we had to be in the same place because someone was dying, I stayed far back out of the way unless I was called up to bat sort of speak. If I saw he was in a certain area that night, I avoided said area the rest of the night or brought another coworker with me to ease my anxiety. 

And inevitably I changed. I’m dating someone new who I don’t work with, and he’s wonderful. I have a set schedule. Set days off. I’m only having to actually work my 40 hrs a week sometimes even less because I flex out early. 

But out of the blue this guy is now saying hi. Asking how I am. Acknowledging me. I think he’s now even picking shifts up on my weekend? Is this just his way of showing me he’s finally fully moved on or is he trying to just be professional? I just want to know what could possible be going through a guy’s head to be doing this 2 years later

We are writing to collect on a debt long overdue.

For generations, you have rigged the system in your favor, exploiting loopholes, manipulating markets, and ensuring that wealth remains concentrated at the top while the rest of us struggle just to stay afloat. You have preyed on the poor, the working class, and anyone who dared to believe in the so-called “American Dream.” You have stolen homes, wages, pensions, and opportunities—betting against our futures while cashing in on our suffering.

Now, we see the game for what it is. We are no longer playing by your rules. And make no mistake: we coming to get our check.

You Built a System Designed to Exploit the People

You told us to invest. You told us to work hard, save our money, and trust the system. But the truth is, the system was never meant for us—it was built to keep us down while you profit from our struggle.
	•	You redlined Black and Brown communities, denying them the ability to build generational wealth, while handing out no-interest loans to billionaires.
	•	You paid women less for the same work, then blamed them for not investing enough.
	•	You crushed small businesses, only to bail out massive corporations when they failed.
	•	You let hedge funds create fake shares, naked short sell companies into the ground, and manipulate stock prices while the SEC looked the other way.
	•	You lobbied for laws that protect your wealth while ensuring everyday people are taxed, fined, and penalized at every turn.

You have spent decades stealing from the poor to feed the rich. And we are done pretending this is just “how the market works.”

Inflation: The Tax That Steals from the Poor

Every year, our dollars buy less, our wages remain stagnant, and the cost of living skyrockets—all while you break records for profits. And yet, you have the audacity to blame us.
	•	You tell us to stop buying coffee, while your CEOs buy their third yachts.
	•	You tell us to invest more, while suppressing wages and jacking up interest rates.
	•	You tell us inflation is necessary, but only we pay the price for it.

Inflation is not an accident—it is a policy choice. A policy designed to keep us chasing survival while you build untouchable wealth.

Wall Street’s Casino: Where Only You Can Win

You treat the stock market like a casino—except when we win, you shut down the game.
	•	In 2008, you crashed the economy with reckless greed, and the government bailed you out.
	•	In 2021, retail investors exposed your corruption, and you changed the rules overnight.
	•	You create synthetic shares to dilute real investors, use dark pools to hide trades, and manipulate stock prices with impunity.

But now, we are fighting back. Over 200,000 GameStop shareholders worldwide have directly registered 75 million shares—removing them from your corrupt system. You can’t borrow them. You can’t manipulate them. You can’t touch them.

This is our financial revolution.

We Are Not Our Ancestors

You thought we would stay silent. You thought we would remain divided. You thought we wouldn’t notice the theft, the fraud, and the lies.

But we see it all.

We are not here to beg.
We are not here to wait.
We are not here to ask permission.

We are here to take back what is ours.

We are not our ancestors.
We will not beg for change—we will force it.
We will not ask for fairness—we will create it.
We will not wait for justice—we will make it happen.

Wall Street, we coming to get our check.

TL;DR Illusen Biscotti very tasty, would recommend trying with extra thyme if using freshly ground cardamom. Use convenience tools like food processors to not spend an eternity grinding pistachios into a powder. Would make again with some optimisations in shaping and spice amounts.

[Don't mind the look, they tasted great!](https://preview.redd.it/235wc8gzm7pe1.png?width=843&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e4dfd1b3160d60a5fd0ba477314d8a24b6c9a57)

\-----

**Process**

*- Time*: the preparation time estimate of 30 minutes on the recipe is probably accurate. Baking time of 1 hour is accurate.

I say ""probably"" for the prep time, because I was stubborn about using appliances (30 mins to grind pistachios with a mortar and pestle instead of something more efficient), and my past mistakes of storing brown sugar came to bite me in the butt (40 mins smacking the rock solid sugar block with a hammer until I had the needed amount).

The prep includes finding the greenest pistachios for the pops of green on the biscotti. Next time, I wouldn't spend so much time doing that because it makes no difference in the taste.

*- Shaping the dough*: I wasn't sure what the recipe meant with shaping the dough into a ""30 cm long sausage"", so I approximated how store bought cantuccini look: narrow and elongated.

The dough had a weird sandy texture that I couldn't bring to an even enough shape with just my hands. I used the edge of the baking sheet instead: I sprinkled some dough-sand on the sheet, folded the edges of the baking paper over it and pressed the dough against the edge. This produced a satisfying loaf of biscotti.

[Demo of the \\""squish against the pan edge\\"" technique and the resulting biscotti loaf.](https://preview.redd.it/bb2ko819n7pe1.png?width=1391&format=png&auto=webp&s=54773a908516d1194deb6d3c9d9e847091797ef8)

*- Baking*: the biscotti loaf crumbled quite a bit as I was slicing it, and the crumbling site seemed to be on the side I didn't squeeze so hard. The pistachios were surprisingly easy to cut, as long as you used a serrated knife and were careful! The appearance of the biscotti didn't change a bit during or after baking. Next time, I would try to use the same amount of pressure throughout the biscotti loaf.

[Cookie yield post baking and slicing. Almost all of them had lost some mass.](https://preview.redd.it/5b0yx7cin7pe1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=055f3923c00952fae9c085487ca64f581b1bc864)

\-----

**Taste**

After cooling down completely, the taste of chocolate and spices came through well, and the biscotti were great with coffee and tea. Wouldn't recommend eating them warm.

I couldn't taste the thyme the day-of, or later. This could be because my thyme was old, and my freshly ground cardamom overpowered it. If there's any left of my ancient thyme the next time I give these a go, I would consider doubling the amount. With fresh dried thyme, maybe 1.5 times the amount in the recipe.

  
The biscotti were Hard. Maybe the shape had something to do with it? I liked it though, dipping the cookie in coffee softened it up a little and intensified the taste.

\-----

**Appearance**

The biscotti in the recipe picture are leagues prettier than mine! Mine turned out lumpy and the pistachios didn't pop as nicely, but the latter is only because my nuts weren't very green to begin with. 

\-----

**In conclusion**

The process was simple, and I liked the taste of these biscotti. Would make again, and knowing what to expect, baking them might not take twice as long as it says on the recipe. I hope that my findings will be useful to people making these for the first time, because I would have liked a post like this myself :)

*   **Precision Temperature Control:** The stagg EKG boasts precise temperature control, allowing you to select your desired temperature (typically between 135°F and 212°F) in one-degree increments. This level of precision is essential for both coffee and tea brewing, ensuring optimal extraction and flavor. the PID controller works behind the scenes to ensure consistent and stable temperature, preventing temperature fluctuations that can negatively impact your brew.

*   **Gooseneck Spout:** The elegant gooseneck spout is arguably the Stagg EKG's most recognizable feature. Its design allows for a slow, controlled pour, giving you maximum control over the water flow rate. This is particularly importent for pour-over coffee, where a steady and even pour is crucial for achieving optimal extraction.

*   **hold Temperature:** The handy “hold temperature” feature allows you to maintain your desired water temperature for up to 60 minutes. This is perfect for situations where you need to brew multiple cups or want to keep hot water readily available.

*   **Countdown Timer:** The built-in countdown timer is a useful tool for pour-over coffee brewing, helping you track your bloom time and total brew time.

*   **Aesthetic Design:** The Stagg EKG is undeniably a beatiful appliance. Its minimalist design, matte finish (available in various colors like fellow ekg black, fellow ekg copper, and fellow ekg white), and sleek silhouette make it a welcome addition to any kitchen countertop.

## Comparing the Fellow Stagg EKG to the Competition

While the Fellow Stagg EKG is a top contender, it's essential to consider alternatives before making a decision. Here's a brief kettle comparison with a few other popular gooseneck kettles:

*   **brewista Artisan Gooseneck Variable Temperature Kettle:** This kettle offers similar features to the stagg EKG, including variable temperature control and a gooseneck spout. It is perceived as a robust choice in the market.

*   **Hario Buono Kettle:** The Hario Buono is a more budget-pleasant option with a gooseneck spout, but it lacks the precise temperature control and hold-temperature features of the Stagg EKG.

1jd7xcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1jd7xcd/no_we_will_not_be_issuing_a_refund_for_something/,"No, we will not be issuing a refund for something that was not our fault.","Some of you may recall seeing this incident mentioned in a comment the other day, but there is MORE. So, as a humble night auditor, I present the following tale:

It's Friday night, and I only have one arrival left (high tier member, called ahead to let me know they were arriving around 3am. Love it when they tell me things so I can do my job). There are some guests hanging out in the lobby, but they're quiet and just minding their own business, so I don't shoo them away (though they are at my favorite table where I like to set up with my laptop.) In walks this woman. She says she has a reservation. It doesn't come up right away, I ask her how long ago she made it. ""Ten minutes ago."" Okay, probably a third party, so I'm already getting ready for a headache just in case. ""Okay, it probably just isn't showing up yet, let me refresh my page and it should be up very soon."" It does indeed pop up after about 30 seconds, third party as suspected. Standard double queen room. I get them checked in, a few minutes she, her husband, and their kids head upstairs, and I start working on the breakfast area, making sure all the coffee stuff, utensils, napkins, etc are stocked for breakfast. Ten minutes later the phone rings. It's the lady that just checked in. ""Hi, our room was supposed to have a pullout sofa and it doesn't."" I tell her I'll look into it and call her back, she says she'll just come down because I'm gonna need to move her to a new room anyway, and I kinda just tell her she can come down if she wants. So I pull up her reservation, pretty sure she's \*not\* supposed to have a sofa bed because our standard rooms don't have them, only the suites, and we're sold out of those. She arrives at the desk with her husband and four teenage daughters.

Cue the arguments. She wants a two queen room with a sofa bed. We're sold out of those. She asks how we're going to make this right. I give her a few options - I can sell her a second room. We have another property from the same brand, but they're long term stay and they usually have bigger rooms that can accommodate more people. She wants me to cancel it, I can't, the third party has to cancel it, but when they call I can approve not charging the late cancellation fee. She wants me to give her a second room for free (lol) and I tell her I can't do that. ""Well, I want to speak to your manager."" Of course you do, but I'm not calling them in the middle of the night so they can tell you the same thing I'm telling you. So I tell her the manager isn't available and she goes ""well who do you call if there's an emergency?"" ""I can call my GM or AGM, but they wouldn't consider this an emergency."" Oh she's big mad now. She finally ends up trying to call her third party but can't reach anyone. I call over to the other property to see if they have space and they do. She abruptly turns around and decided to stay. (She had been not looking at me this whole time.) They're quiet the rest of the night, I notate it in my report thinking they're gonna complain, but when I come back the next night, the AGM says she didn't. Alright, I'm thinking it's over. 

Dear reader, it was not over. Guess who I get a call from at 1am wanting to talk about our ""mutual guest""? That's right, she got in touch with them and they wanted to know if we could do a refund due to ""failure to provide promised amenities."" Uh, no, absolutely not. Either she read the booking wrong, or the info is wrong on your site, but that was not our mistake. So I denied the refund, text my AGM that they tried to get one, and go about my night. But, just now, it's night 3, and guess who's calling me \*again\* as I'm getting breakfast ready? As soon as they said the name, I immediately told her we wouldn't be doing a refund. I don't need to pull up the reservation, we aren't doing it. She got what she booked. And I just. The audacity. If suxpedia wants to refund her, they're more than welcome to do so, but we held up our end of the deal. ",56,1742200448.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,5,0.99,False

He wasn't really my type, but I liked his profile and he seemed nice enough, so I gave it a shot. Additionally he said he'd be open to just friendship because he's new to the area.
Now we went for coffee, had a really nice time and talked for quite some time. I didn't feel a romantic connection, but I also know that sometimes it takes a while for me, so we exchanged numbers.

That was two days ago. Since then he keeps texting me all the time, and this morning he told me that he misses me?? Not even 48h after our date ended?

Tbh even if I had the biggest crush on the guy I'd be so weirded out.

My friend said it's cute and that I'm being dramatic, but I feel really uncomfortable with the intensity. AIO?",8,1742200114.0,AmIOverreacting,22,0.91,False

1jd7to8,https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1jd7to8/how_is_this_surviving_when_i_feel_like_i_am_dying/,"“How is this surviving, when I feel like I am dying?” Yunjin’s weverse letter","Yunjin of Le Sserafim just posted a weverse post talking about some very deep things and her thoughts from last year. I knew it was hard for them, how could it not be? Going through a big hate train and being seen as the villain when you have done absolutely nothing. 

Yunjin is, unfortunately, not the only idol that goes through this and neither is Le sserafim the only group that goed through this. 

I know criticism exists and when it is done in a good way, it is really helpful. The thing is, kpop fans aren’t people that give good criticism. No, some of you are just straight up bullies. 

There are a lot of things I want to but cant articulate, so here is Yunjin’s post from weverse. 

Yunjin’s post: 


""I am not who I was a year ago.

I have a new favorite artist.
I drink a different coffee.
I do more or less the same things, but I think in a way that the person from a year ago did not know how.

For better or for worse, this trilogy has been a memorable experience.
I write this in remembrance of the past year — all the unfathomable joy and unfathomable pain, and of the questions life begged of me — because I want you to understand why it means so much to be here with you today.  

All of last year, I had asked myself, “How do we survive this?”

‘To survive’ by definition means to continue to exist, in spite of an ordeal or hardship.
While I wish just simply existing had come easy, despite my best efforts, I do not remember feeling all that existent.

What I do remember, rather, are waves of debilitating shame, doubt, envy and emptiness.
I remember nights of doomscrolling through comments, knowing I shouldn’t, when even my morality failed to suppress the longing for someone’s kindness.
I remember loneliness.
I remember fear of the end. That what started as the small fire of my dreams had gotten so uncontrollably big that I was losing everything I knew.
How is this surviving, when I feel like I am dying?

But what surviving really is, the past year has taught me, is an experience contingent on accepting a kind of death.
Just as building muscle is feeling weak
and building knowledge is feeling dumb,
fighting to exist is allowing yourself to fall apart. 

I suppose Rilke was right when he wrote that clarity cannot be given to you unless you first live your question. 
Because the more I got up and asked, “is this the right way to go on?”
I found myself gradually experiencing my answer.

The answer was in my refusal of apathy. 
It was in the dinners I had with my members.
In the calls with my family.
In the small talk, which was never truly small, with our staff.
In the letters from those who love me, their pensive pen and colored paper.
It was at TeamLab, it was at Weverse Con.
It was the sweat on the dance studio floor. 
It lived in the music I saved.
Even the tear-stained pages of my diary, they all had the claw marks of my love persevering.

Love persevering — it is the embodiment of this album. 

I am thankful for the experience EASY, CRAZY, HOT has been.
I am thankful for the many versions of myself it took to meet the person I’ve come to know today.
She is not perfect, but she knows how to stay grounded.
She is stronger, wiser, and closer with the people she loves.

I like her.
In fact, I might even love who I am right now.
And she’s rocking the ginger hair, if I do say so  myself.

Anyone who dares to love cannot make it through intact.
I know that now.
If there is any wisdom you can take from this letter, it is most of all that.

Pain means I am changing.
What a beautiful, exciting thing.
And whoever I’m becoming,
I’m sure I’ll learn to love her too.""

I  
  
 didn't know this was possible until now lol Mind. Blown. so i did some online digging and turns out there's a new thing other than SEO going around called LLMO which is optimizing for language learning models like chatgpt, perplexity and other AI models and it looks like there are already early adapters without the rest of the world knowing.   
  
ChatGPT in particular is becoming a search engine itself because a lot people -as i said myself included- refer to it when it comes to running a search or asking questions to which the answer arrives a second later so it's used for roduct recommendations, travel tips and even lfie advice.   
  
After a small search, i think we'd all benefit from optimizing our content for chatgpt to show it in its answers.   
  
Here's what chatgpt itself says about LLMO content:   
  
\- ChatGPT loves helpful, detailed content. If your website answers specific questions (like “best coffee shops with outdoor seating”), it’s more likely to get picked up.  
  
\- Natural language is key. ChatGPT isn’t looking for keyword-stuffed nonsense—it wants content that sounds like it was written by a human, for humans.  
  
\- Structure matters. Clear headings, FAQs, and step-by-step guides make it easier for ChatGPT to understand and recommend your content.

*FalI,*

 *Logistics.*

 

The only thing I can focus on is the sounds of my feet hammering against the ground and the rain slapping my skin. It's dark as shit and I'm trying to read the street signs to get to the spot, but I can't read for the life of me. I stop in an alley for shelter and sit there for a second to catch my breath. I then began to make sure I got everything in my jansport. 



I count the cash trying to carefully flip through it while my hands shake and tremble from the adrenaline still rushing through my body. There's about ninety-four hundred in the stack, although it was a little short it was still a decent yield. I rifle through the rest of the contents to make sure I didn't leave anything behind, wallet, phone, house keys. *All right that’s all of it, now I just gotta get to the spot.* Taking off on foot, the foreground becomes the background as my vision becomes more and more tunneled and my mind focuses purely on getting from point A to B as fast as I can. The screeches of horns and the low murmur of engines and rain create a symphony to score my dread. My pace remains static, not too fast as to not arouse suspicion yet not slow enough to elicit danger. *Only two more blocks*. I think as I come up upon the Stockton St. sign, a shining light in a sea of desolation.



The sense of urgency persists as I try to shake off the paranoia when the house comes into view. I slowly approach and look around as I begin to inch closer and closer. Checking every dark corner and cranny to ensure that I'm not being followed, every moving shadow or slight twitch of the light makes the hair on my neck stand up more than the last. I just need to get into that house. The familiar sight of slowly rotting boards and chipping paint becomes clearer and clearer, I quickly run around the side up the house and onto the sopping wet back porch trying my hardest to keep my feet from slipping on the rotting wood. 



I just about fall into the door as I slam it open, feeling like I damn near broke the hinges off the aging metal frame. The smell of mothballs and weed hits me almost as soon as I walk in. I close the door slowly and begin making my way through the kitchen, trying my best to stay at least decently quiet while stepping over the cracked opaque tiles. The small bits of light seeping through from holes in the roof serve to guide me on my way to the basement. I stumble across a kitchen which hasn't seen a meal in probably over five years, holding onto cabinets and countertops and avoiding puddles and trash strung along the floor. I finally make it to the basement door where the real challenge awaits me: the stairs. A set of steep wooden steps which probably haven't gotten any maintenance since the house was built, I've had to go down once or twice before; both times ending with me falling the rest of the way down at some point. The fall is almost inevitable, however I'm just hoping they actually stay intact long enough for me to descend. 



My first foot goes onto the first step and I begin making my way down, ever so carefully taking each step to avoid eating a full course meal of shit. The long broken banister, now just metal racks hanging from the walls to my sides provide no help whatsoever. As I successfully complete my descent I come upon the all too familiar sight of the decaying, cluttered and above all else dusty ass basement. My eyes meet Zach, who's laying on the old worn down, ripped up couch. Somehow the bastard sleeps on that thing almost every night, including right now.



I approach the couch and stand there for a second while debating the best way to wake him up. After much deliberation (about 3 seconds) I decide on the tried and true method, one as old as time. My hand flies at near terminal velocity and sails across his face with a thunderous boom. It takes a second but he opens his eyes and stands up the fastest I've ever seen him do it. 



“Wha- who, what was that about?”  He angrily mumbles while he registers what just happened. 



“Come on Derek was that really fucking necessary?” 



I laugh and follow with “Yeah, I think it was very necessary”



“Yeah you think. Seriously, why couldn't you just yell or something?”



“Cause if I yelled I never would have gotten my point across.” I reply semi joking, semi assertively. 



“And that point is?” Zach questions with a confused look on his face. 



“How do I put this without sounding like an ungrateful dick.” As I say this his face goes from slightly asleep and confused to almost concerned. 



“Alright man, I’m fucking tired of this stuff, I’m thankful that you’re finding work for me. I really am. believe me. This past week though man, you've been sending me to do this shit solo, I need my backup. I came this close to getting caught tonight. Then what? I mean depending who catches me; you gotta either bail me out of jail or some poor city workers gotta scrape my sorry ass off of the sidewalk.” I assert while looking at him with as serious of a face as I can muster. 



He sits there and thinks for a second; the wrinkles on his face contorting as the gears in his head turn. He doesn't look as pissed as expected. The guy ponders and purses his lips before he begins to speak again. 



“You didn't get caught though did you?” 



I look at him in almost disbelief. The audacity of this asshole. He must've damn near read my mind because he almost immediately starts backtracking. 



“Ok, ok just listen for a sec. I understand you don’t wanna do this stuff by yourself, I mean I get it. Shits crazy out there nowadays and anything could happen. You know as well as I do that ripping off street plugs isn't necessarily the most noble line of work.” 



He speaks as he pulls a pack of cigarettes from his breast pocket and puts one in his mouth, he begins to return them to his pocket before he hesitates and holds the pack towards me. Almost like an afterthought. I take one out of the package and light up our respective cigs. He once again begins to speak to me between long drags and labored coughs. 



“Now, being in the business that we’re in there's a certain level of risk that we invite into our lives, you knew this when we started working together again. Lest we forget it was you that contacted me after you couldn't keep straight.” His tone becoming more assertive, he once again picks up on the slightly pissed off look on my face. 



“Look I mean again, I understand you don't want to do these things alone and I plan on going back out there with you in the future. However you have to understand that while you're out there I'm in here taking care of logistics and all that shit.” 



“Ah, working on logistics? Logistics. Like sitting on your ass? Shooting up and sleeping all day? I'm no expert, so correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm not too sure that constitutes “logistics”. I regret my smart assery as soon as the words leave my lips. 



“Fuck you Derek”. Not a sign of playful antagonism in his voice. 



“No really fuck you. You call me to pull you out of your miserable life, so I do it. Sure the works not great but guess what, its fucking profitable. So don't come at me talking about what I do because as far as I’m concerned; if it wasn’t for me youd still be slinging burgers at Mc-whatever-the-fuck or whatever other meaningless work you were doing when you called me. And by the way, by logistics I mean making peace with the people who we don’t rip off so that your sorry-ungrateful ass doesn't get knocked off while on the job. Not to mention taking money out of **MY SHARE** to pay off the police. So next time you want to come down here and complain about what I fucking do, don’t bother.” He ranted angrily, the veins on his face popping and almost crushing his cig between his fingers. 



I don't even try to respond, just look at him while puffing my cig, the anger from his face now slowly dissipating. 



“Is that all? Was that a satisfactory answer for you?” He follows up his rant in a condescending voice.

I try to give a rebuttal but I decide to just drop the whole thing. 

  


“Yea, shit sorry for coming at you like that. Just stressed from that last job, I really thought I was going to get clipped out there tonight.” 

  


“Like I said, I understand you're mad and stressed but I'm pulling my weight too. 



Enough of this petty bullshit though, how was tonight's yield?” He asks, now sounding slightly more genuine.



“How was tonight's yield? Oh man you’re gonna fucking cum when you see I ripped from those cocksuckers.” 



I get up and walk across the trash filled room to grab the backpack, the “hardwood” floor considerably soft after years of neglect and water damage. I pick up the bag, half surprised to see that no mice are gnawing on the fabric. Zach reaches over to grab it like an impatient child, I give it up and the excitement on the greedy bastard's face is contagious. 



He hastily rips open the largest zipper pocket and sticks his fat hands into the bag with a certain light in his eyes which I only really see from him when money or vice is present. The bag bends and contorts while he fumbles through it and pulls out stacks of cash and other “goods” and puts them on the coffee table with the same enthusiasm as a kid on Christmas. 



“Yeah, biggest fucking yield sinc-” Im cut off by the piercing sound a window breaking upstairs.

The room falls silent and neither of us dare take a breath 

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


*II,*

*Consequences.* 

  
  
  
  




Absolute silence is the only way to describe the atmosphere of that basement, each breath feeling like a herculean feat as we dread whatever may be awaiting us. As we both look at each other with fear in our eyes, a slow and methodical rhythm of footsteps begins to sound from upstairs. Although the steps were light in sound, they might as well be thunderous tremors. Zach looks at me with a sense of urgency and ever so slowly reaches for the gun on the coffee table. What the hell is he doing? He must've read my mind as he looks dead in the eyes and raises his index finger to his lips as if to tell me to shut up before I make any noise. He motions for me to hide or get away from here and I don't need much convincing before I’m quietly making my way to the storage room. Every step I take sends a ripple through my body, trying my best to be as quiet as I can on the way to the storage room. I finally make it into the dusty, pitch-black room and position myself behind a box while making sure I have a clear line of sight to Zach. 



*How the hell did I end up in this dusty ass basement cowering in the cobwebs with some junky? I was walking across a stage with a bachelor’s degree in my hand three goddamn years ago!*



Some time passes and the light footsteps and rustling from above continue, before I know it they’re gone. I’m still stuck here, not taking any chances

 

We wait a little longer, maybe 10, 15 minutes, neither of us daring to speak first

 

The uneasy feeling remains in the room, waves of tension permeate the air, hell they’re almost visible. Zach, fighting the urge to nod off hasn't moved an inch; bug-eyed, steel in hand, body poised permanently towards the basement stairs. I shoot him a quick “hey can I get out of this dusty ass storage room” look. He looks back and gives a hesitant nod, his eyes still full of paranoia. Slowly and carefully I begin making my way towards the couch, eyes darting, checking every corner and inch of the house, every step brings me closer to the unknown. Finally letting myself take a cautious sigh of relief. I look down to make sure that I’m not stepping on anything. I look to Zach, his face relaxed and body less rigid, he puts the gun on the table and reaches for his box of cigs, “God damn man. Want one?”



“For sure man, we really gotta insta-“



BANG



The metal door crashes off its hinges and creates a rattling boom against the rotting wall. The unbearable silence we had gotten so used to is penetrated by shattering noise, a shadow races across the room in an instant, refusing to be recognized. My mind is racing but still, unable to process a thi-



BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG



And just like that the man on the couch is no longer a man, no longer anything but a pile with a piece of hot metal stuck in his forehead. A skeletal man in a shitty hoodie stands over him, breathing like a collapsed bouncy house. He just stares down Zach’s body for a moment before turning rapidly and fixing his gaze to me.

It was 3:33 a.m. when my phone rang.

I wasn’t even really asleep, just drifting in and out on my couch, my mind floating somewhere between dreams and the quiet, empty dark of my living room. 

But then I heard the low, rattling vibration on the coffee table. 

I reached for my phone while squinting at the screen.

And that’s when my stomach dropped.

It was my own number. 

Calling me…

At first, I just stared. My brain felt fumbled and half-asleep, trying to make sense of it. Was I dreaming? Maybe my eyes were playing tricks on me? 

Nope. It was real. My name. My number. Calling me on my phone.

Every part of me screamed to ignore the call, to put the phone down and just…let it ring. But before I could even think, before I could even question it, my 
stupid hand just… answered it. 

At first, nothing. There was just static. But as I focused on the sound, I swore I could hear people whispering all at once. 

Then..breathing.

Slow. Shallow. Ragged.

Then… My own voice.

“He..Hello? Are you there?” Hey man, say something if you are.” 

Everything in my body became stiff. 

It was definitely me. Not a recording. But me. 
Speaking!

I could feel my pulse hammering inside of my ears. 

“Who..who is this?” I whispered, barely able to push the words out.

Silence.

Then, my voice again… Shaky, broken and scared.

“Uh.. I..I… I made a mistake.”

A thick, awful dread curled in my stomach. My fingers tightened around the phone.

“What mistake?” I croaked. “Who is this? How the hell did you call my phone from my own number?!” 

The breath on the other end trembled. And then…

“Whatever you do, do not answer tomorrow’s call.”

And then the line went dead.

I sat there, perplexed, gripping the phone so hard my knuckles went white. 

I didn’t sleep after that. The anxiety and panic in my body was at full tilt. 

I paced back and forth, staring at my phone and watching the screen, waiting for it to light up again.

But nothing else happened. Not until the next night.

With all of my nerves rattled, I did end up falling asleep. Of course, with the help of a few Vodkas. 

But I don’t know how, my body just knew when to wake up. No alarm. No sound. My eyes just snapped wide open. 

And the air in my bedroom felt… dense. Heavy. Like something was sitting in the dark, watching and waiting from the corners.

I grabbed my phone and walked around my apartment. Almost like, I was looking for something to happen. 

I felt too awake to go back to bed, so I sat on my couch and lit up a smoke to relax my nerves.

Then… My phone lit up. Same. Exact. Time.

Smoke exhaled from my lungs as my heart sank into my chest. 

3:33 a.m. — With my name and number right on the screen.

A slow, ice-cold wave of terror crawled throughout my entire spinal cord. 

And I just stared in complete disbelief. 

I could still hear my own voice from the night before giving me that disturbed warning not to answer the phone call.

And my heart was pounding and thumping! 

It’s like that feeling when someone dares you to look inside of a dark room. You know you shouldn’t, but you can’t resist because the urge is unbearable.

So, I answered. And this time, the voice was not mine. 

“You were warned not to answer. Why did you answer? Are you that curious? Would you like to know why I called you?” 

The words came out mangled. Distorted. Stretched out and choppy like someone had taken my voice and twisted it.

Then… The sound of this wet, sloppy movement of something shifting and dragging..like flesh against wood.

Then, a faint whisper. Right in my ear. Too close! 

“It’s your turn now.” 

I immediately dropped the phone and my entire body locked up, frozen and ice-cold.

And then…Five knocks at my front door.

I live alone. 

I didn’t move. I didn’t breathe. I just stared at the door. Shivering like Winter had just came through my apartment. 

Five more knocks…

Slow and deliberate.

I wanted to scream so badly, but my throat wouldn’t work. I just stood there, stiff, heart blasting, staring at the door, waiting for the handle to turn, waiting for… 

But it never did. Nothing more happened. 

The next thing I know, morning was here. I must’ve fallen asleep at some point, though I don’t remember when. 

The light was bleeding through my blinds, too bright, too normal.

And then, I saw a piece of paper lying at the edge of my apartment door which looked to be shoved. 

The edges were damp. The paper itself was crumpled, like something had gripped it too hard with fingers that didn’t have any bones.

I picked it up, hands shaking, and smoothed it out.
Two words. In my own handwriting.

1jd7r9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jd7r9k/express_oracle_jet/,Express >>>> Oracle Jet,"Rant 

We had the Barista Express for 5 years, and we loved it. It worked great. We upgraded to the Oracle jet, which looks pretty and cool, but it was a mistake. It looks cool to show off to guests, but it doesn’t deliver the espresso we want. 

First, the ground coffee is too much, like 24g. That is way too much for espresso. And to adjust that, you have to fiddle with a screw. If I paid 500 for the machine, I understand. But the damn thing is 2k! On the express, you can adjust the amount of powder very easily. 

Second, the “guide” is pretty useless. The ratio/yield is completely off, and the machine is telling me you have a balanced espresso. How?? Let’s ignore the yield, it tasted sour! I can do a better job with a simple scale on the Express. 

Third, I tried the automatic steam wand and I couldn’t figure it out. The milk was so runny and just full of foam. Who cares about the foam? The milk has to have some texture, otherwise, it feels like you are drinking hot milk with some coffee, not a latte. 

There are some pros, but the cons make it not worth 2k.

I think if you want to make an actual espresso drink, just go for the simple machine like the Express or Pro. Maybe the dual boiler if you want more features. 

That is based on my experience, maybe others feel differently.

1jd7q6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoon/comments/1jd7q6z/kendu_has_the_potential_to_be_a_multibillion/,Kendu Has the Potential To Be A Multi-Billion Dollar Brand,"This is gonna be an overview of Kendu, unfortunately due to the sheer size IRL products, events and other Kendu tales I cannot go through all of this in one post. In addition, there will be some things that I will forget, but I am gonna try my best.

**Introduction to Kendu**

Kendu is a memecoin that is on 3 chains: Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We were initially only on Ethereum but we have wormholed to the other 2 in the past few months. Kendu is focused on organic, non KOL, growth. We are entirely community led, focusing on both social media and IRL events/products. Kendu has completely captured social media, I am sure you would heard about Kendu or at least seen our name somewhere. We have 18k holders and this is growing even in this market.

**IRL Events**

Kendu has lots of events coming up and some that have already happened. In December, Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, this is a significant event, where lots of crypto enthusiasts were present. NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami.  
Kendu Pickleball, in India, Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in th Pickleball community and has been a great success so far.  
Over the next few weeks Kendu is the main sponsor for Miami Music Week. StaySeaArt, Inkstradamus and NoSleep305 have played a significant role in this. The group are giving out lots of Kendu Energy(yes we have energy drinks, more will be mentioned later in the post), they have created a Kendu Energy cocktail menu and are giving out merch. These are certified Kendu Legends!!!

[Pickleball Event ran by Ishan](https://preview.redd.it/379w7m1xk7pe1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e17a9942da5ea39957733a6f6baf0fd964221cdd)

**IRL Products**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu pendants and recently Kendu Beer.

**Why IRL Alpha is Important**

IRL events/products are a great way for Kendu to reach both crypto enthusiasts and non crypto people. I don't see Kendu as a basic memecoin, I see it is a multi billion dollar brand, just like Nike and Sony. Kendu is dominating and entering lots of billion dollar industries. Kendu is bridging DEFI and IRL and this is a reason Kendu is gonna be a frontrunner this year!!!

We also have a lot of Kendu tattoos. I mean..... who else has that conviction?

[Tattoos](https://preview.redd.it/ao55zwpbl7pe1.jpg?width=968&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af8b4071943699b147551434ec5d15c4bf22ecaf)

**A Few Interesting Ideas**

Shib, Doge and Pepe have shown what sort of potential organic memecoins have, it shows that there is no ceiling for growth. The fact that Shib went from 20 million market cap to 20 billion in 36 days. Yes you read that right..... 36 days. Kendu has been recognised by mutliple crypto OGs. These people all see the potential in Kendu, we are creating a recipe to take over both IRL and social media. Kendu is the Shib 2021 opportunity, all the signs are there, Shib was at a similar MC at this point in the cycle(this cycle seems to be more delayed compared to 2021). Kendu is focused on running it up the same way the other MemeCoin Hall of Famers have done in the past. Kendu is unstoppable and we continue working in this market!!!

In terms of social media presence, Kendu has the potential to take over the tsunami that was Shiba Inu.  
Kendu can easily 1000x this year at the time of writing this post. In my opinion we can 3000x but I am a dreamer lol.

I advise you to join our telegram, even if you don't hold a bag. Ask any questions you want, we are a very welcoming community : ) In the TG you can find me as Luke Skywalker.  
Skip the Starbucks and put the money into Kendu $10 can easily become $10000.

It is your choice Anon, this is your opportunity to cement your name in crypto history. Join the winning team, we are KENDU.

We Don't Gamble, We Work!!!

About a year ago I met this girl at a gig and we became fast friends. We had always had some amazing chemistry, and were typically pretty touchy around each other. She was taken at the time, so I threw the idea of us out of my head. But now, she’s single again, and we had an interaction recently that just sent butterflies up my stomach. You know that moment after you hug someone, you usually let go pretty quickly, right? Not us. After we hugged, we kept holding onto each others arms and then just looked at each other for a second longer than usual. Idk if she felt something that day, but I surely did. Imma slow burn kinda guy though, so even though we’ve been friends for a year now, there’s no need to jump the gun in my opinion, especially since she just got out of another relationship.

This was the reason why I have stopped caffeine consuming since around a month ago. 

I feel way better these days. I don't feel heavy tiredness in the morning and I still fell fresh at the evening without any caffeine.

1jd7o9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jd7o9h/one_week_in/,One week in,"So as the title says in one week in to my caffeine journey. I quit because I’ve been having some health issues since September 2024. I had a virus induced hyperthyroid problem and now my levels are back in the normal range but I felt I still had a huge sensitivity to caffeine. I first tapered down from coffee to tea but in all honesty it didn’t make a difference so I went cold turkey on all caffeine one week ago. 

Day 3 I came down with a cold virus though from reading on here it seems it could be part of the withdrawal. Massive headache which peaked on day 5 and has been slowly reducing since. 

Muscle aches, eyes get fatigued faster when staring at screens. 

I’ve noticed my skin has improved already. I suffer with red skin on my face and this has definitely calmed down. 

I also notice going to sleep a lot easier but I’ve been waking around 3am. 

Before quitting I had some sinus issues, pressure and clogged ears. Since quitting this has massively reduced and I’m not entirely sure why but I’m grateful and hoping it continues. 

I’m not missing the caffeine too much, more the idea of meeting a friend for a coffee. Herbal teas just don’t have the safe effect! Decaf also seems to still affect me so I won’t be switching to that. 

I guess I’m just here to sort of document my journey and be accountable to myself and others! Hoping to feel better with each week!

I also eat bananas drink 100 per cent cacao and eat avocado every day which apparently increases catecholamine which is bad for COMT. 

I’m going to reduce high Intensity exercise and also the food diet and try to taper off my medication.. but I’ve tried so many supplements in the past that over methylate me or give me a histamine response that I don’t know what to do. 

Is anyone in the same boat ? And what helps you. I might give a B complex a go again and ride out the over methylated symptoms and just cut out things that increase histamine and catecholamine. My homocysteine levels were fine last time I checked ",1,1742199200.0,MTHFR,4,1.0,False
