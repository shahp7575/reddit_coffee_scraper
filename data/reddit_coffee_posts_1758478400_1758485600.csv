1nn28f1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/1nn28f1/did_anyone_experience_something_similar/,Did anyone experience something similar?,"So first I‚Äôll start with a little backstory for context. One day I decided to take a nap and my little brother was supposed to wake me up around 6pm bc I was going with a friend of mine to a party. First I had a dream that I was at the party and yk it was a classic weird dream with silly stuff happening (one involving my parents‚Äô weird behavior). When I ‚Äûwoke up‚Äù into an another dream things got really weird. I was at my house, mad that my brother did not wake me up. Everything was like in real world, the house, time and even weather outside. The only outstanding thing was the fact that my body was super heavy and I mean fentanyl posture kind of heaviness. Somehow I got in the kitchen thinking that a cup of coffee will help and told my brother about the party dream. Then he responded in a way he would never have in real life. I realized I was asleep, and I looked at him. He stoped doing a coffee, looked at me like deep inside the soul and the whole dream collapsed and I woke up, this time for real. Ik it might be too long to read but I wonder if anyone has experienced something similar ",1,1758485363.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

1nn27qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1nn27qf/reveal_the_best_electric_kettle_experience_with/,Reveal the Best Electric Kettle Experience with Amazon Basics,"The Amazon Basics F-625C Electric Kettle has become a staple in my kitchen over the last couple of weeks. From my morning coffee ritual to evening tea sessions, I‚Äôve used it extensively, and there‚Äôs a lot to unpack about this little powerhouse. With its sleek black and silver design and glass carafe, it not only looks appealing but delivers convenience and functionality that elevate your typical tea kettle experience. However, like most products, it‚Äôs not without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the design grabs your attention. The glass carafe gives it a modern touch, enhanced by the blue LED illumination when boiling water. Honestly, watching the LED-lit water boil can feel oddly satisfying‚Äîespecially on darker mornings. I found the overall build to feel sturdy yet lightweight, which makes it easy to handle even when full. The handle stays cool to the touch, something I value when I‚Äôm half-asleep and trying to pour a cup of tea. The compact dimensions make it ideal for various countertop sizes, ensuring it‚Äôs a good fit even for smaller kitchens.

**Ease of Functionality and Performance**

The 1500-watt heating element is probably the star feature. It heats water at breakneck speed, and I genuinely appreciate not having to wait ages for my coffee water anymore. Whether I‚Äôm boiling a full 1.8-quart capacity or just a single cup, the process is impressively quick. Plus, the Strix thermostat control is precise and reliable, giving me the confidence to leave the kitchen knowing it will auto-shut off once it hits boiling point. I‚Äôve also tested how it performs with smaller water amounts, and the boil-dry protection works as a lifesaver for those forgetful moments‚Äîa feature I didn't realize I'd appreciate as much as I do now.

**Benefits**

- Rapid boiling thanks to its powerful 1500W heating element.
- The automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection add layers of safety.
- BPA-free materials ensure no strange chemical taste in your beverages.
- The wide carafe opening makes filling and cleaning quick and hassle-free.
- Blue LED lights give an elegant touch while in use, acting as both a functional indicator and mood-enhancer.
  
**Drawbacks**

- While the glass carafe is visually appealing, fingerprints and smudges can build up easily, needing frequent wipes to keep it clean.
- The lid feels a little flimsy; it snaps open fine, but the latch mechanism could wear out over time with heavy use.
- The power cord length isn‚Äôt very generous, which might limit its placement in some kitchens.

**Competitors**

When comparing this electric kettle to other popular options, like the Hamilton Beach Glass Kettle or the Cuisinart PerfectTemp, it holds its ground in terms of affordability and functionality. Though the Hamilton Beach version also has a glass carafe with blue LED lighting, it tends to heat slightly slower than this model‚Äôs 1500-watt element. On the other hand, the Cuisinart kettle offers temperature presets, which this model doesn‚Äôt have. That said, the Amazon Basics kettle is an excellent budget-friendly option if customizable temperatures aren‚Äôt a priority for you.

**Smart Spending**

This electric kettle hits the sweet spot between performance and affordability. While it doesn‚Äôt come with advanced features like temperature presets or specifically insulated carafes, the performance it offers at its price point is genuinely impressive. It‚Äôs perfect for everyday use, whether you‚Äôre a casual tea drinker or someone who needs a quick boil for instant noodles or hot cocoa. Comparatively, some of the high-end kettles might look more premium or offer unique features, yet this product matches or exceeds the essentials for a fraction of the cost.

There‚Äôs this coworker (26M) that I (22F) started to like 2 months ago. We haven‚Äôt had a personal convo together, it was always work related. He used to go to the same uni I had gone to and played in the hockey team, and long story short, but I was able to get in touch with his friends who r still in the team and they said he is likely single. I‚Äôm just gonna ask him out on a coffee date. 

The reason I fell for him is cheesy but it goes like this: at work I was talking with a senior colleague and I happened to say smtg funny (which at the time I didn‚Äôt realise was funny), and this guy was standing next to the senior colleague and burst out laughing. Keep in mind I never knew who this guy was beforehand. His smile just melted my heart, it was so beautiful and sincere and it caught me off-guard. Ik it‚Äôs cheesy but that‚Äôs the honest reason y I fell for him. After that I obv paid more attention to him at work. He is very down to earth, humble and kind. He is going to be moving workplaces in a couple weeks I think so I don‚Äôt wanna rock up to work one day and realise I‚Äôll never see him again.

Never asked a guy out before 

What should I not do? What should I avoid saying to not mess this up. Any advice on how to say it softly without sounding too forthcoming?

So I 18f my bf Luke 20M, my friend Alice 18f and her bf Max 24M went together to a girl‚Äôs birthday party on Friday night. We got there and went to get some drinks and smoke outside. My bf didn‚Äôt drink anything since he was driving us that night so he just got some coffee and water. Me and Alice got a mojito but she couldn‚Äôt finish her drink.On the other hand,Max already drank 3 glasses of vodka with apple juice in just 30 mins after we arrived there. I asked why he is drinking this much and he said that the drink is pretty light and he doesnt even taste the vodka in there so after those 3 glasses,when he went  to the bartender,he asked for more vodka in his drink.

After 2 hours we noticed that he started getting drunk and made inappropriate remarks and jokes about me or other girls there (this isn‚Äôt the first time he does this)

Backstory: One time i slept at Alice‚Äôs place to help her bleach and dye her hair red,Max called her drunk and told her if he could sleep there.She said that i was staying for the night and that i cant leave.His friend started calling me names and other insults and Max said in a sarcastic tone that how we are going to sleep.I said that I will sleep in another room and there isnt any problem. After that he and Alice started exchanging insults and shouting and he literally said ‚ÄúIf you aren‚Äôt okay with me then i will sleep with op‚Äù.That left me with a sour taste in my mouth and I told Alice that this isnt okay.

Coming back to our current situation:He started staring at me and made some unfunny jokes (i dont remember exactly what he said but anyways).Later i asked Alice to get some photos of me and my bf and i also offered to take pictures of her and Max as well. They agreed and i started taking the pictures.I told Max to put his hand on her waist,to kiss her, hug her, so the pics are cute. And he (by that time he was getting more drunk) said ‚ÄúBut you are taking the pics, i cant put my arms around ur waist‚Äù. And also when i was taking pics with Luke he came behind me and tried to ruin our photo he also made comments about my butt which i ignored. One time he even touched it and i got pissed and went to Luke‚Äôs arms, and I could see that he was fuming with rage. 
I told him that its not worth it fighting over this because Max is drunk and if he started to fight with him it would get worse. 

At around 12-1 am Max got even worse he started taking his clothes off and making everything a fuss. I went outside with Luke talking to his mom.Then i saw Alice speaking with Max, and they were having an argument.While they were talking, Luke went to the car to get smth.I went to them and asked ‚ÄúWhats up?‚Äù. They said they were fine and Alice kept going on with her discussion and told max ‚ÄúIm not scared to get cheated on,but in scared u might leave me‚Äù (he also cheated on her before btw, but she also cheated)
I left and I went to my bf bc i felt that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there anymore

After 30 mins Alice felt dizzy and went to the bathroom. Max came with a glass in his hand and asked where is she.I told him that she is at the bathroom bc she isn‚Äôt feeling great, he threw the glass right beside me and it shattered and he started running to her.

Before we left he got into an argument with other drunk guys and said he was going to beat them up.We barely convinced him to get into the car and leave.

After we left i stayed a bit longer with Luke and started talking about this whole situation and he already has a bad feeling about Max.I agreed and my bf told me that Max isn‚Äôt worth Alice‚Äôs time or feelings.So the next morning i spoke with her and told her that the way he is acting drunk it isnt okay and she should break up with him if he is still going to act like a teenager while drunk. She got defensive and told me that its none of my business and that it is her choice what she is doing with her relationship.Which i agree to,but this relationship got so toxic to the point she is always complaining about him everyday.And his drinking problem makes it worse.We argued a bit over this but i think i did the right thing.

Others told me that I was mean for telling her to break up with him,because I dont really know whats going on between them.But is she truly happy? So i will ask you guys too,AITA?",2,1758485209.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

If you‚Äôve ever dreamed of biking in the Alps but weren‚Äôt sure where to start, maybe this post will help. I‚Äôll cover only the logistics ‚Äî not costs or climb details (those are abundantly available elsewhere).

A friend who‚Äôs ridden the Alps many times reminded me that I wasn‚Äôt getting any younger ‚Äî I was 62 at the time ‚Äî and told me: *just start by going to Barcelonnette, France.* On my first morning there, I understood why.

Barcelonnette is more than a beautiful, small medieval town. It runs like a resort: every bakery, caf√©, sporting goods store, coffee roaster, and supermarket seems united in one purpose ‚Äî getting you up the mountain. The single-minded focus feels like a ski town, but for cyclists.

# How to Arrange the Trip

It turned out to be surprisingly easy:

* Book a room at the **Grand Hotel** in Barcelonnette.
* Reserve a bike at **Cycle Ubaye**.
* Reserve a car from **Sixt**.

That‚Äôs it.

Here‚Äôs how it goes: you land in Nice, pick up your car, and drive three hours to Barcelonnette. Check in at the Grand Hotel, then walk ten minutes to Ubaye Cycles to pick up your bike, helmet, and probably buy two water bottles.

# What to Pack

Some things you might not think of:

* A long-sleeve shirt and a waterproof jacket
* Long-fingered gloves (it‚Äôs cold at the top, and I was glad to have them)
* Your favorite, reliable tire-changing tools (I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with what came in the saddle bag)
* A Camelback-style backpack for carrying gear and as an extra water supply

I didn‚Äôt notice any water fountains on the upper half of the climbs, and I think on most cols the last fountain is below the halfway point.

# The Routes

We rode three cols. I‚Äôd recommend two of them:

* **Col Saint Jean** ‚Äì The approach road is unsafe. Unless you have another way of getting to the climb, I‚Äôd skip it.
* **Col de la Cayolle** ‚Äì The most beautiful ride I‚Äôve ever done.
* **Col de la Bonette** ‚Äì The most challenging ride I‚Äôve ever done.

The roads themselves are amazing ‚Äî park-like, in great condition, with light traffic. Expect a motorcycle every five minutes, a car every ten, and plenty of other cyclists.

# The Grand Hotel

When you check in, besides your room key you‚Äôll learn where the shared bike locker key is kept. There‚Äôs a warm sense of camaraderie among guests as everyone rolls their bikes in the back door and stores them together.

Like ski hotels, the Grand Hotel is set up for cyclists: cubbies for shoes and helmets, a stand to suspend your bike, basic tools, and a pump.

# Ubaye Cycles

A ten-minute walk from the hotel. If, like me, you only speak English, it‚Äôs best to email well in advance. Only one of the three staff members speaks English, so replies may take a day or more.

The bikes were excellent. Bring your cycling shoes so they can adjust the fit, and check tire wear before you ride. The saddle bag comes with one spare tube ‚Äî I‚Äôd buy a second to be safe.

# When to Go

September is ideal ‚Äî specifically the week after the motorcycle rally. Before that, it‚Äôs often too warm; during the rally, the noise is overwhelming; too long after, and you risk snow at the top.",0,1758484828.0,cycling,0,0.5,False

eating hurts. even the most plain and bland food makes me bloated and leaves me in pain for so long.

I can't drink plain water anymore... I only drink tea, broth, electrolyte tablets dissolved in water, or the occasional coffee. I'm willing to suffer a bit for some coffee, honestly.

I feel like every day I get a bit worse. I'm constantly nauseous, before and after I eat. I haven't had a bowel movement in over a week. I'm in pain and I'm tired of it.

my parents keep trying to convince me to eat, but they don't understand that I feel like I physically can't. I think they think I'm using this as an excuse to not eat. that's understandable because I'm anorexic too. 

I think severe restriction has caused these symptoms for me. I feel like I ruined my body. the guilt is so intense. 

the pain after eating is just reassuring my eating disorder that I don't need food. I don't want to eat if it hurts so much. why would I want to? 

I'm about 39kg. I'm 5'6. I hate the way I look. I have the body of a malnourished little boy and the stomach of a pregnant woman. I'm bloated with a ""rock in the gut"" feeling that hasn't gone away in days.

Grand Central -> Montauk Lighthouse.,"Over a decade ago when I got my first road bike I had the idea to one day ride across all of Long Island, where I‚Äôm from. I finally got around to training for it this summer and I‚Äôm proud to say I completed the ride on Friday, September 19th 2025! It was sick. 

Note - the stats below are for 126.9 miles since my bike computer didn‚Äôt record some of the ride after my first stop (21.6 miles into the ride). I tracked the missed part of the route and it was 1.6 miles. 

Total Active Time 8:05:51

Total Elapsed Time 11:30:19

Total Paused Time 3:24:28

126.9 miles (204.23 km) 

Average speed 15.7 mph (25.27 kmh)

Total Ascent 1,781 feet (542.85 meters)

I mostly followed the route from someone who previously completed the ride several years ago. It was super easy to follow and mostly just riding in a straight line on pretty flat roads through the south shore of the island. It was such an amazing experience and I‚Äôm beyond happy to have finally competed it, but I likely won‚Äôt do it again until the Long Island greenway is completed‚Ä¶whenever that finally happens. 

I brought a bunch of food and good drinks with me, based off of help from others in this subreddit and of course my experience experimenting with different options. 

Breakfast and coffee around 6 AM - steel cut oats, vanilla Greek yogurt, craisins, one banana. 

During the ride - Fig newtons, uncrustables, clif bars, huma gels, bananas, haribo gold bears, nerds clusters.

*Having sunk into the realm of her thoughts, Zofia would take her eyes off the notebook resting on her lap and gaze outside, at the rows upon rows of trees making up deep, uncharted forests she was passing by. Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family‚Äôs issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they‚Äôd live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking for someone to GM this story, I‚Äôll contribute as much as you wish. Be it brainstorming, playing some side characters, you name it. As someone who knows how it is to GM, I wish for you to enjoy the roleplay as well (Ôºæ-Ôºæ)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I‚Äôd appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I‚Äôd love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we‚Äôd write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^‚Äù I don‚Äôt mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don‚Äôt want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you‚Äôre dealing with. You may call me Frog. I‚Äôm a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don‚Äôt be deterred by that even if you‚Äôre from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don‚Äôt have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that‚Äôs worth a mention!

The [X4Y] tag does reflect the gender of my characters, not my own. I prefer not sharing it. I hope you‚Äôll understand <3

- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I‚Äôve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don‚Äôt want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let‚Äôs brainstorm them together!*

Currently have a filter coffee setup & a very basic 4 bar machine that i somehow make-do with using coarsely ground coffee.

So far the best deal I have been able to find is for the Delonghi Magnifica Start ECAM220.60.B at 40-41k. Is this a good deal? My other option is to get a decent (something that matches its output quality) espresso machine, a decent grinder (that can grind fine enough for espresso), probably a naked portafilter, maybe some other accessories within 40-41k.

Should I look at something else?

Background : I am ""value"" focused here. Budget wise I am fine to extend it till 40-45k only, originally was looking at cheaper machines (Delonghi dedica around 15k, plus a half-decent grinder around 5-10k maybe, plus a portafilter at around 2k maybe) when i stumbled upon this deal & thought that this is actually more value for money.

Use case : Morning coffee 2 cups with milk. Afternoon coffee 2 cups with milk. Time is an issue for me so the convenience of a fully automatic does have a certain appeal, but at the same time I don't want to spend this much and still miss out on the delicious coffee flavor.

1nn1qzu,https://i.redd.it/79lkjtm9okqf1.jpeg,Rolife Silent Corner with modifications (GNU),"Another one working on Silent corner. I've had the idea kicking around the brain for years to make a homage to my favourite author and series so this is sort of a ode to Terry Pratchett's works. I've spent about 10 hours so far working in as many tweaks as I can to modify it- making at list at the end for people to play eye-spy with will be fun :)



Nothing earth shattering in technique so far- I've made a few cats from polymer clay, then painted but I'm not sure if I want to try again yet, the jury is out if I like them.  I do have to go back to the clay and play again though- I need to make some custom luggage.



Pictures by the laziest method possible mostly- google image search copied to word (easy to resize to the wanted dimenstions and put many images on a page).  I also used my scanner to scan in a few book covers (paperbacks can be held so you can get the whole front-spine and back). I used a mix of the provided stickers and gluing images onto the original. A wise person would efficiently measure and put on one sheet... I'm not a wise person so I've printed a lot of pages along the way.



Tip wise I will shout out Art Glitter glue - unlike most it will dry clear and matt so any little bits that sneak out to the front, don't show. I also played with some dimensional paint in gold for making the frame more 3D but didn't love the look. A very simple frame around an image can be achieved with running a metallic felt tip pen on the edges and looks cleaner.



Onwards- I hope to finish this soon, partly as I'm on a roll and this has been fun, and partly as I have to get back to boring life things and need to pack up the disaster area that is my work space (aka the coffee table).

Joker is a sweet, affectionate pup who has so much love to give. He's known for his big heart, playful energy, and his signature move-giving hugs! Whether he's going out for a walk or snuggling up for attention, Joker's joyful personality shines through.
He does have a bite history and can be protective around food, so he needs an experienced and understanding home willing to continue working on his behavior.
This pet is at risk for euthanasia due to the current shelter capacity. Currently the shelter is above capacity to adequately house and care for animals.

I was eager for the medication help. My wife was cautious because of her upbringing. Medication only if absolutely necessary.  I convinced her to at least talk with her Dr about it. Miraculously, her doctor was booked out several weeks and my wife had another thing come up that needed attention. My doctor had an appointment Thursday and prescribed it no questions asked after she said ‚ÄúI think I want to try it. ‚Äú

Doctor said it would take 1-2 weeks for the prior authorization to go through. Something glitched, Costco pharmacy called yesterday saying it was ready for pickup. No PA was required.

But now it‚Äôs officially happening I‚Äôm worried about the outcome and that I‚Äôm going to be wasting their time and nhs funds. So I‚Äôm coming on here to share some ‚Äòsymptoms‚Äô just for a bit of impartial input. 

I‚Äôve always as long as I remember had this overwhelming sense of being unable to do anything, like i am not capable of doing anything off my own back unless someone helps me or tells me what to do. 
I have zero self esteem. 
I have always assumed people think I‚Äôm too quiet or weird. 
I have a core group of friends from childhood but I never reach out to make plans for fear of being rejected. I struggle to make new friends. 
I am very impulsive and make rash decisions without thinking through as if I am physically driven by something and can‚Äôt stop myself. Small things like tattoos and piercings and buying things I don‚Äôt need or clothes that don‚Äôt suit me. Big things like getting married to someone I knew wasnt good for me. Moving out of London just because. Having a baby because I didn‚Äôt know what else to do with my life. 
I‚Äôm so distracted when working (from home). Everything is done last minute or when I have a burst of ‚ÄòI must do this NOW‚Äô. 
I daydream and imagine random scenarios I believe for a dopamine injection. 
I cannot drink coffee (I get instant jitters then crushing tiredness) 
I over share big time. And always regret it. 
I listen to a handful of songs on repeat for a week or two then move on to a different set. 
I wiggle my toes all the time. 
I can‚Äôt stay in one position too long. 
I do not make eye contact when talking to anyone. 
My house is messy but in a way where I know where everything is. 

BUT I was never an overly talkative energetic child. Quite the opposite. In teenage years I think I displayed selective mutism when in group situations. 
I did fine at school. Even though I constantly doubted myself.

1nn18wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathoftitans/comments/1nn18wi/my_first_time_being_betrayed_has_me_messed_up/,My first time being betrayed has me messed up,"There is a TLDR at the bottom.  So I've been somewhat betrayed in this game before this morning, but not to this degree.  Like I've had groups that I've helped out win a fight turn on me, which I guess I sort of get because I'm still a trophy and they don't really know me, but this time was a little more personal.  Skip to the long paragraph titled 'The Betrayal' or the TDLR if you're not interested in backstory leading up to this.  

So I got woke up kind of early this morning by our newborn and once he settled back down I figured rather than go back to sleep for 45 minutes to an hour before the other kids got up I'd jump on path for a little bit. Played my hatz for a little while, died to a couple of cool concs, then switched to my freshly sub-adult Sarco since I switched sub species.  

First Death: My Sarco was in the Green valley north lake. Not long after logging on I get attacked by an adol or maybe sub duck.  I tried to just back away from him and not retaliate but he kept coming so I killed him.  I move to the south lake and do a little recon around it checking for threats or prey. Get in a small fight with an Amarg when I see a baby sarco get in the water.  I think to myself "" I've not adopted a baby in this game yet. He could  I wouldn't mind grouping with him and helping him grow while I grow."" Suddenly there's an adult croc in the lake with me. I'm thinking the duck had an adult sarco parked in the south lake because I never heard it come in the water and it wasn't there when I scouted the lake. He attacks me while I'm trying to ask him if the baby croc is with him.  We sort of pause and swim away from each other for a moment, and again get attacked while typing because he moved of my screen and circled around me.  By this time I'm pretty low and now empty on Stam from his 0¬≤ bites, so I go down swinging.

Okay.  Kind of sucks, but not much of a set-back.  

Second death: I spawn in sharptooth Marsh.  Awesome. Been wanting to bring a bigger Sarco here.  What's not awesome? I immediately hear loud footsteps maybe an island away.  I jump in the water and wait to see if I can tell what it is. The footsteps fade like they're heading up towards desolate pass so I relax some. I'll begin questing a little bit. Get a location quest for burned forest. Turn back to burned Forest, grab that and on my way back I hear the footsteps again, this time on the center island. This time. Two sarcos making a nest. Oh goodie. I'm hidden pretty well so roll the dice on if they're friendly or not and call out to them with a message asking if they'd want some help. Thought maybe if they're friendly I can build my own nest over there as well since nesting materials come back so fast and that'll give me a good bit of growth. They don't answer and they start looking around. Not friendly. Alright, time to dip to Birchwood because I really don't feel like swimming in the ocean for the next 10 minutes.  I wait until I see them head West into the marsh and then I head towards the river when...
""Daddy we're hungry. We want breakfast!""
Crap. Okay let me hide in some bushes on this little island.  When I turned I saw one of the Sarcos and I moved into some branches.  They turned and swam West in the opposite direction from me.  Cool.  I get in the bushes, grab a pack of bacon out of the freezer to start thawing, grab another cup of coffee, and return. Mind you this took all of 2 minutes.  Well that's all it took for the 2 Sarcos to circle back around to the East side of the swamp, and as soon as I reach the water's edge they're on me.  I tried to run, but I knew my goose was cooked.

I'm starting to get irritated at this point.  My one bar of growth I've got back since switching subspecies is nearly gone now as well as some marks. What I was hoping was going to be a relaxing and fun morning of Path is starting to become quite the opposite. Admittedly I'm starting to piss and moan a little bit in the global chat towards the two sarcos that killed me before I come to my senses knowing it's not going to do any good, so I start swimming back west of ripple Beach from the island it put me on. That's when I spot in global...

The betrayal:

""hi sarc in golden plateau"". 'Great' I thought,'am I fighting for my life 2 minutes after I spawned?'. I turn around to see, you guessed it, another Sarco swimming at me.   I stop and I sit there staring at him when he sends me a group invite.  I hesitate at first I've only ever really grouped with my friends in the game and I don't normally accept group invites from strangers, but as he closes the distance  I know this we're wearing the same skin and the same colors and he almost immediately comments 'lol twins'. I think to myself seems happy that you found someone that matches, so I agree to the group invite. If anything I can get some green quest now and we can grow faster.  Let's call him Nick. I asked him if he wants to go to GV since we're just south of it. I'm thinking if my killer from earlier is still there there's two of us now so we should be okay or we can even enact some revenge. I tell him a little bit about my morning and he says he's had a similar one where sarcos have been killing/attacking him all morning.  At least we're in the same boat. We pause at the top of the hill before the South GV lake and I tell him that somebody was in there earlier that killed me so watch out. I get in the water first and a different adult Sarco is in there and starts heading towards us, but doesn't attack. That's somewhat a relief but with two of us I'm sure we could have taken him. We're now at the top of the South lake and I asked Nick if he wants to head to the North lake. He responds rather quickly with a 'sure', but then it clicks with me. We need to grow and what faster way to grow than getting a trophy? That white Sarco in this lake is a trophy. The server is restarting soon so we won't have to worry about mega packs or his friends coming after us.  I asked Nick ""do you want to go to the North lake, or... Do you want to go get that trophy and claim this lake?""  Nick:"" Either one is good to me.  He is an adult"".  About that time the white Sarco walks across the top of the hill in front of the bank we're on and we start following him. He he soon realizes we're following him and he gator dashes a good ways. I'm thinking to myself' that's it. If we just jog a little bit and keep pace with him we'll catch up to him before he gets all his stam back and if Nick is even okay at combat we'll have him.' The white Sarco was about to enter the pass to the right of the cliffs overhanging the northern GV lake when I went in for the attack. I noticed Nick wasn't right behind me, but I thought that was just strategy so we both don't get hit by swerve or something like that.  I began hitting the white Sarco and he does indeed have swerve and manages to hit me. Not too much damage so I stay going. I'm thinking after a moment 'where is Nick?', then I get the message 'group disbanded'. My first thought is maybe he got disconnected because he was sort of lagging behind before the attack and he was nowhere in sight now. Lo and behold here comes Nick running from behind a ledge and I think'oh okay don't know what happened there but he's good now' and...He starts attacking me.  I know maybe I shouldn't have been shocked, but he had ample opportunity to do this earlier when I went to sleep on the bank right next to him and  instead waited this whole time until I'm fighting something that could have helped us grow.  It's a 2V1 now and I don't have it in me to go down swinging after that so I ran to the edge of the cliff and waited to see you if Nick was fully committed to killing me. He bit me two more times at the edge of the cliff so I threw myself off not wanting to give him the satisfaction.  Told them in global'Nick you did me dirty, but congrats on the trap in GV.' The white Sarco started messaging saying he actually had no part in it and didn't know Nick. Who knows if it was true or not, but the white sarco did also say that way earlier in global chat Nick said something like 'Sarcos shouldn't fight sarcos, sarcos strong together' and sure enough after scrolling through 30 minutes of chat he did say that, so maybe he just didn't like that I planned and followed through on attacking another Sarco.  Both Nick and the white sarco we're already logged out when I checked the player list.  

TLDR: Had a crappy morning and another player took 15 minutes to lure me into a false sense of camaraderie when we grouped and vibed while having ample opportunity to kill me, but didn't try until they could really stick the knife in my back and twist it.

1nn171k,https://www.reddit.com/r/cf4cf/comments/1nn171k/38_independent_oregon_gal_seeking_independent_man/,38 - Independent Oregon Gal Seeking Independent Man,"
Are you content being single, but still crave intimate companionship? Not lonely, but wish you had someone by your side for life‚Äôs daily little errands? Fine on your own, but think it would be nice to have someone to hold your hand through this weird, wacky, sometimes dark and scary ride called life? Same here, friend. 

So, here I am: an employed, independent woman in my late 30s living in the rainy part of the Pacific Northwest. Seeking a strong, genuine connection with a human male between the ages of 35 and 45 who‚Äôs emotionally intelligent, self-aware, and ready for something serious. Ideally, you‚Äôre child-free, employed, responsible with your finances, and DDF. Bonus points if you‚Äôre actively managing your mental health (we all have something to work on). I‚Äôm all for a little social drinking or an edible on a lazy summer day‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not into stoner culture or dealing with anyone who needs to stay high to get through their day.

A few key things about me: I‚Äôm a leftie and an atheist. If you lean conservative, we probably won‚Äôt click‚Äînot just because of politics, but because I deeply believe in individual liberty, self-expression, and treating others with decency and respect. A partnership built on mutual respect is non-negotiable. Today‚Äôs conservative doesn‚Äôt appear to align with those values (from my vantage point, anyway).

What I‚Äôm looking for: A peaceful, quiet life in a cozy cottage by a creek, where we can garden, hike, fish, and enjoy the beauty of nature. Sit in the back porch and watch the lazy sun set while drinking freshly brewed sun tea. It‚Äôs been over 15 years since my last relationship, but as I get older, I‚Äôm realizing how much more enjoyable life can be with a solid, loving partner to share it with. I have one cat, but love all animals and am fine sharing my life, bed, and couch with whatever other critters end up in my care. In my cottage fantasy, I can go full Snow White and try to feed deer and foxes with my bare hands. I may even already have the dress ready to go! 

Attraction matters, and while I‚Äôm clearly not a supermodel (I'm a solid 4.5/10 or whatever your version of average is, and that‚Äôs only on a good day!) I do my best to dress well and age gracefully‚ÄîBotox and (a disgusting amount of) SPF are my secret weapons. I‚Äôm of average height, weight, and have a mom bod (minus the kids, of course). I‚Äôm looking for someone who takes pride in their own health and hygiene, because I‚Äôm all about living well and feeling good for as long as possible. Looks aren‚Äôt everything. We all get old and wrinkly. Let‚Äôs celebrate the weird ways our bodies change and appreciate our youth while we still have it!

A little about my health: I‚Äôm managing PMDD, type 2 diabetes (in remission but never gone) and other hormone-related chronic issues, which have taught me to prioritize self-care. If you‚Äôre in a similar boat, or just believe in keeping yourself healthy as you age, we‚Äôll be on the same page. I don‚Äôt want to be a burden as I get older, and I also don‚Äôt want to take on the role of caretaker for my partner if they haven‚Äôt made their health a priority too.

My hobbies include: Hiking, walking around the neighborhood petting dogs, going to the gym (but not obsessively), reading, spending time with family and friends, solving puzzles, and just about any activity that sounds interesting. Beach days, zoo trips, art shows, camping, grabbing coffee, thrifting, debating the latest in news or pop culture, attending drag brunch and Mariner‚Äôs games, walking around Costco snacking on samples, etc. etc. If it‚Äôs a good time, I‚Äôm there. Most recently, my friends and I made a last minute, random trip to Oaks Park to roller skate and eat elephant ears. I‚Äôd love for you to come with on the next adventure!

What I want in a partner: I want someone who will treat my friends and family like their own. My best friend should be able to call you when her car breaks down. You‚Äôll call my brother-in-law for help with a project at our future cottage. I want my nieces and nephews to look up to you and call you ""Uncle."" I want your mom to feel like I‚Äôm the daughter she always wanted. I want your friends to be happy that you found someone who will take good care of you. And if nothing else, I‚Äôm always up for making new friends who enjoy hiking, road trips, visiting quirky small-town tourist spots, and who just want to live kindly and with empathy toward others.

I‚Äôm sure there are 900 other things I should‚Äôve included, but I‚Äôve talked about myself enough for the next ten years. If any of this resonates with you, feel free to reach out! Whether you have questions, want to swap pictures, or think we might be a good fit, I‚Äôm excited to meet you.

1nn16xm,https://i.redd.it/4p1czokljkqf1.png,"I updated Atlas for Retail, MoP and Anniversary with a new UI and features","You might remember me from [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1l6ld8z/i_updated_atlasloot_for_retail_including/) a few months ago about updating AtlasLoot for retail. Long before that though, I forked Atlas and fixed the errors so that AtlasQuest would still work. Since then, I've added new features and maps, with the latest being an updated UI that fits in with Retail, MoP and Vanilla! There's an example up above, with other images available on the [Curseforge page](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlas-fork).

**New features over the last year**

* Support for Cataclysm and MoP
* Maps for Shadowlands, Dragonflight, TWW and some SoD instances
* LFG button that takes you to the group browser for that instance (SoD and Anniversary only)
* Defeated indicator for bosses (Retail only)
* Separate scale and transparency options for the ""small"" map view, so it can be used as a separate minimap
* Revamped UI, with small functionality tweaks to make things a little nicer

**Links to all my addons and BMAC**

* [Atlas (fork)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlas-fork)
* [AtlasQuest](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlas-quest-fan-update)
* [AtlasLoot Enhanced (fork)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlasloot-enhanced-fork)
   * For Retail
* [AtlasLoot Classic (fork)](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/atlasloot-classic-fork)
   * For Anniversary and Classic Era
   * Next on my list is to update this for TBC and integrate SoD, and maybe give it the UI update I gave retail
* I also started a [Buy Me A Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/nanderson11) so I can dedicate more time to working on these addons",38,1758482939.0,wow,4,0.91,False

But now, with honors duly paid, on to the story.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**God Lives Below the Earth**

When I was a little boy, my mother taught me that God lived in heaven far away. She taught me that, although distant, God was knocking on the door of my heart, and I just had to open the door to let him in. But when I was a kid, I never felt him knocking. Instead, I would look through my window at the constellations that danced their circuit through the night sky and imagine that my distant God lived among them. Then I imagined that God lived beyond them. And the older and older I got, the further and further away God became.

When I stepped onto the boat for the first time, I wasn‚Äôt particularly impressed: keel caked with barnacles and once cheery paints rendered pale imitations of their former selves by decades of exposure to the Atlantic brine. Ugly though it was, the fishing vessel Tarshish bobbed gently in the harbor thirty minutes from my hotel room in Tampa. I knew why the company had opted for a fishing vessel instead of something fast or flashy. It was cheap, sure, but more importantly, it was low profile. The last thing we needed was unwanted attention.

It certainly wasn‚Äôt the fanciest (or cleanest) transportation I had ever employed, but it wasn‚Äôt all that bad. The crew qualified among the cheerier examples of sailors that I had encountered in my career; most mariners aren‚Äôt all too pleased when a corpo diver intrudes upon their solace. Evidently, I had caught them just before payday, and the company‚Äôs fee for transporting me would be stacked on top of it. When we returned from this voyage, we would all be considerably richer. Some more than others.

The captain was an old salt dog hardened by a lifetime negotiating the brine, Russ by name. Russ was a stern and stony man until a bottle unscrewed decades of hard living on the open sea. That night, miles out from sea, he cornered me below deck in the mess galley where I was running calculations for the big dive. The sailors were getting hammered in preparation for payday but generally left me alone. Only the cook, Hunter, disturbed my focus by keeping my glass full and my plate loaded. Russ, however, did not share their respect for privacy. I endured his apparently genuine attempts at connecting with me after he occupied the seat next to mine, sipping at an old flask. I answered his probes with grunts or monosyllabic answers until he asked a question that caught me off guard.

‚ÄúCome again?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think about God?‚Äù Russ was serious. Here was a grizzled captain of fifty years‚Äô experience inquiring on the religious disposition of his contracted passenger.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt thought about God for a while.‚Äù I admitted. ‚ÄúI focus a lot on my work.‚Äù Russ laughed.

‚ÄúI guess that makes me lazy to think about him so much!‚Äù Russ chortled. ‚ÄúIn the open water, sometimes you have nothing but time to think.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think about God?‚Äù I set down my pen and turned the question back on him.

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm quite sure about it. I‚Äôve met him!‚Äù Russ remarked, a broad grin lighting up his flushed face. ‚ÄúHappened when I was just a greenhorn; fell into the water just off Anchorage, almost froze to death then and there.‚Äù He paused.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù I asked, but Russ held his pause, grasping for words to describe his experience.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember much. I was cold, too cold to swim. Muscles spasming, sinking, sinking deeper. Then warmth, a light in the dark‚Äîand a voice. He told me everything would be alright, that he was here for me. I knew I was talking to God.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid he introduce himself?‚Äù I asked, somewhat dismissively.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt need to‚ÄîI knew.‚Äù He nodded thoughtfully, as if reassuring himself. ‚ÄúI knew it was him.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt lying when I said I hadn‚Äôt thought about God for a long time. Russ‚Äô anecdote brought me back to when I was eight. I was sitting in an early morning Sunday school, learning about the fish-god of the Philistines: Dagon. Dagon was a false god; he was an empty idol that people worshiped even though he wasn‚Äôt really there. That was the day I asked my Sunday school teacher what made Dagon false and our God real. I still remember the warmth of her smile.

‚ÄúBecause God is knocking on your heart right now, he really wants you to be saved so you can spend forever with him in heaven.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow can I know if I‚Äôm saved?‚Äù I remember asking. Even as a child, my question was not so much motivated by a fear of hellfire as it was a desire for‚Ä¶ something.

‚ÄúBecause God really, really loves you. Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart, you just have to let him in. Do you want to say a prayer with me?‚Äù

I never felt him knocking. I prayed that prayer half a dozen times; first when I was eight, then nine, then ten, and then at twenty‚Äìtwo, with a useless degree behind me, I decided to take matters into my own hands. If contact with God, with the reality beyond reality, was really on the table, then I would do what I must to have it. I set sail for seminary.

But now I was on a ship headed west. I leaned on the lacquered railing of the fishing vessel‚Äôs deck and observed rolling waves of brown and green, the sun high in the sky above me. I realized, rather suddenly, that I was not alone. I glanced up at the avian copilots of our mission, the seagulls which had followed us from shore. The persistent little devils were drawn to leftover fragments of fish whose odor perforated the air. They screamed constantly and scrapped over detritus, but the presence I felt was not seated in the gulls. Glancing around revealed an empty deck, the crew busying themselves below deck, or fore, or aft. The smell of fish, the cries of gulls, and vision of endless sea brought to mind the Lovecraft story Dagon.

My Sunday-school teachers had taught me that Dagon was the fish-god of the Philistines, and the Lovecraft story 2 assured me of the same. My later studies would prove otherwise. Sure, Dagon was worshiped by the Philistines of the bible, but he wasn‚Äôt a god of fish, that was a mistranslation because the Hebrew word for fish is ‚Äúdag.‚Äù When they discovered the cult of Dagon, we found that he was a grain god who had nothing to do with the ocean, worshiped first in inland Syria. No, I couldn‚Äôt expect to find Dagon in this place, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that somebody was out here with us.

By dusk we had reached our destination: just about the center of the Gulf of Mexico. The sun was beginning its habitual descent toward the horizon; the last, gentle rays painted my face orange and violet, the heat gently stung my skin. Soon, on this summer‚Äôs new-moon night, the only lights for miles around would be our humble vessel and the distant stars above who watched over all of humankind with silent disregard.

I was joined at the rail by several sailors as the sun‚Äôs light faded and a new sun became visible to us. Not in the sky, not along the horizon, but below the water. We stared down into the abyss and a yellow light in the void stared back. It diffused softly through the otherwise inky depths, transforming, by some lost alchemy, black water into crystal jade. The sailors regarded it with suspicion, murmuring among themselves about the presence which intruded on their silent night. I suppose corporate hadn‚Äôt seen fit to key them in on what exactly we‚Äôre doing out here. While the others were unsure of how to regard the unexpected phenomenon, I found the source of that feeling‚Äîthat feeling that we were not alone‚Äîfinally localized in the light itself. I was overcome with the strongest sensation that it wanted to meet me, and it beckoned me closer.

I complied. Thirty minutes later, I was in the water. The atmospheric diving suit occluded much of my peripheral vision, but I was able to orient myself by following the soft rays to the golden light. It was gentle and inviting, a long-lost friend waiting for me at the bottom of the ocean. Distracted though I was, I made certain that the umbilical which would feed me a steady diet of atmosphere was secure and that my reserve oxygen tanks were ready. After signaling a thumbs-up to the sailors above and patting the tools on my belt to ensure their security, I answered the light‚Äôs invitation and began the dive.

The waters shifted and shimmered from crystal green to aquamarine around me. The sea parted for my passage closer and closer to my luminous friend as I strove down, down, down. Blue lights seemed to blip in and out of the periphery of my vision, stars emerging to dance with their underwater sun on its circuit under the earth. The kelp, mansions of those bioluminescent krill, extended their hands to pull me deeper into their home, children eager to show off their room and toys to a new friend. Shadows of fish and sharks drifted lazily in the green, but never did they dare trespass into the cone of yellow light that illumined me as I went deeper. I saw a manta ray, ten feet wide, drift past me, unaware of or apathetic to my presence there. I saw horsefish pull their young along in a line around the stalks of lambent seaweed and fish full of eggs searching for a place to nest among them. A massive thing was floating to my left; I took my eyes off the light to see a sperm whale floating vertically, one eye watching solemnly as I entered its home. The monolithic cyclops hung inert in the water and sang a hymn to some or another diluvian idol, a blessing upon its strange new guest.

I was struck with wonder at the life in this alien place that I had trespassed upon: a garden of trees of life and two of every animal. Eclipsing them all was the light: all of the goodwill that I felt from the denizens of the deep were reflections, I knew, of the lull that pulled me deeper still. The deeper I went, the stronger that lull became. I felt my face flush and my stomach flutter‚Äîwhether from pressure or desire I do not know‚ÄîI was infatuated with the light, that new sun that I had discovered waiting for me far below the earth.

Long before Babylon was built, the Mesopotamians worshiped Enki, god of the deep. Enki lived far below the earth in a freshwater aquifer cut from the corpse of a cosmic monster. Enki was the giver of life; he sent forth the fresh water that fertilized the fertile crescent and allowed human civilization to flourish. When the mythic hero Gilgamesh sought immortality, it was in the subterranean realm of Enki that he found it. Sinking through the garden below the waves, I believed it. If the source and sustenance of life was to be found anywhere, it would surely be here.

‚ÄúJonah!‚Äù Russ‚Äô sharp voice startled me from my trance.

‚ÄúGo ahead.‚Äù I answered the captain through my radio but continued my descent.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a problem topside, you need to start making your way back up.‚Äù

‚ÄúProblem?‚Äù I paused annoyedly, watching life teem through the garden. ‚ÄúWhat problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a grease fire in the kitchen, we gotta get you back up in case we lose power.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I paused. The lull diminished slightly. ‚ÄúAlright. How bad is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúHunter‚Äôs trying to control the fire, but I‚Äôm not taking any chances. You‚Äôd better get up here.‚Äù

‚ÄúCopy that, on my way.‚Äù I took one last look at the light: its warmth continued to beckon but the lull that invited me deeper was noticeably less intense now. I felt cold as I began my ascent apologetically. I wondered if it would miss me as much as I missed it.

By the time I reached the ship, the fire was out. I was beyond frustrated: the inconvenience felt as though I had been kept from the arms of a lover. My frustration was probably palpable as I hung over the rail of the ship and looked down at the distant, glowing object of my affections. It looked back, and the sailors gathered around me like the flies that attended fragments of fish and flesh in the corners of the deck.

‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù A feminine voice asked as we all looked down at our new sun. Wendy was the only woman on board, and she sounded genuinely curious as she took a break from slurping down a milkshake to ask her question, her lips puffed out from contact with the sweet treat.

‚ÄúPolicy dictates that I cannot disclose the identity of the asset.‚Äù I answered robotically. In truth, corporate had told me very little about the target of my recovery mission, no doubt they had kept the sailors completely in the dark.

‚ÄúI heard it singin‚Äô to me,‚Äù someone in the group said a little too loud. ‚ÄúSingin‚Äô like ma used to, it sang my favorite songs. Made me feel like I was back home again, said I was‚Ä¶ safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI dreamed a dream about it,‚Äù emboldened by the witness, another sailor spoke up. ‚ÄúIt was like a big, bright father to me. Said it was proud of me, told me to quit drinkin‚Äô so hard.‚Äù

‚ÄúI felt it too,‚Äù Wendy said, adding her paper cup to the litter of the ocean. ‚ÄúIt was‚Ä¶ I never felt anything like it. It was‚Ä¶ well, it was an experience.‚Äù

Experience. The desire to experience God had led me to that seminary which had occupied three years of my life. Once I arrived, I realized that I was the odd man out. Most of my peers were there because they had already experienced something in their life that they described as contact with God. Despite how common it was in our cohort, I had never enjoyed such an experience, and it wasn‚Äôt for lack of trying. I had tried meditation, I had tried prayer‚Äîso much prayer. As my studies advanced, I tried to replicate the practices of the Desert Fathers, the first monks, and their precursors in the Syrian wilderness; I studied the deep contemplation of Catholics in the West and the hesychast meditation of Orthodoxy in the east, all to no avail. No matter how much I knocked on God‚Äôs door, he never once answered. So, after three years of study and prayer, I laid down my books, and I think I laid God down with them.

When I laid myself down in my bunk, the creak of the rocking ship my only lullaby, I thought I would have dreamed of my rendezvous in the deep, of the lover‚Äôs lull that called to me even as my eyelids drifted shut. My rest, however, was dark and deep and dreamless. When the rising sun disturbed my rest, it was time for dive two.

This time I went deeper. Beyond that Eden, the aquamarine sea bled black. Inky darkness cut the verdant wake to ribbons that spiraled deeper, deeper, deeper. Deeper is where life ceased. The bioluminant stars did not follow me, no denizens of saltwater paradise danced around me. Detritus alone offered me company, flesh from a million dead fish mingled together in a nondescript chum. Although the webbed appendages of some unknown creature would occasionally spill over the edge of the cone of light, nothing ever emerged from the dark to claim their bloodless eucharist and commune with the gristle of the sea.

The darkness pressed against the cone of light that protected me, undulating like tentacles of an antediluvian kraken, wordlessly striving to overpower my shield and add my flesh to the chum. But then the detritus dissipated, the alien limbs no longer trespassed on the edges of the light‚Äôs gaze. Without the living or the dead to keep me company, I was alone. The darkness continued to press inward on the cone of light; the dominance of my lambent friend seemed threatened by the pressure of a trillion gallons of darkness pressing down on it. I became terribly afraid that the deep darkness would choke out the light entirely and I would be left alone in the great and terrible deep. Yet the lull of that lover far below beckoned me still into the dark, stronger than it had ever been, and the lull overcame all fear.

When Moses ascended the holy mountain, he followed a great light. The mountain was on fire, the people were afraid and refused to go any closer. But following the fire, Moses met the Lord in a cloud of glory. He passed into the cloud, and he was consumed by divine darkness. If God is light, then he needs a cloak of inscrutable darkness to shield him from our prying eyes. Otherwise, I suppose, we would all cease to be. It isn‚Äôt for man to set eyes upon the infinite, my pastors and my professors had assured me as much. So as I entered the dark cloud of glory, I interrogated the light: ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù

I‚Äôm not sure I expected an answer, like Moses at the burning bush, but I got one. The light blinked. Then it sputtered. Then all my fears came true: it died.

I cannot describe the darkness in words, only that it seemed as if I was suspended in frozen blackness. My heart skipped, my insides roiled, nausea and fear and trembling seized command of inert limbs. The deep had opened its mouth wide to swallow me whole: and its jaws had just snapped shut. In the belly of that whale, I sank.

Time stopped even though I didn‚Äôt: while I was sure I was passing deeper and deeper still, I couldn‚Äôt tell how long I had been falling. A minute? An hour? Forever? Impact startled me from the spiral as my feet hit bottom. My momentum carried me down and my back thudded against the shale of whatever diluvian soil I had struck. I laid there, staring upwards, immobile. I supposed that beyond my gaze, far above the black coffin that entombed me, the sun was again setting again on the land of the living while I lay in the realm of the dead, the miscarried infant of a god I did not know. Surely this is how the Psalmist felt when he looked up from the valley of death and begged for mercy from his distant God.

But as I lay in the darkness, cruciform across a rocky shoal, I realized that even in the dark the lover was beckoning me still. The absence of the light had done nothing to deter the lull, and it beckoned me forward into darkness with greater intensity than I had felt before. My tastebuds shivered with the taste of sweetness and copper, my heart fluttered with anticipation instead of fear, my face flushed. With great effort, I sat, then I stood, then I put one foot in front of the other. The lights on my dive suit were barely enough to illuminate my immediate surroundings: white sand beneath my feet offered the palest reflection as I took step after labored step. No direction seemed better than the other, but the lover‚Äôs lull pulled me that way, and I followed.

I trespassed into the darkness and a form loomed into view at the edge of my vision, the fruit of my labored steps. A riveted metal hull, blanketed in part by extremophile algae, rose far upwards and outwards and forwards, a fellow alien in this foreign land. I placed my left hand on the hull and guided myself along its length. Painted letters drifted into sight one by one: ‚ÄúU.S.S. Cetus.‚Äù I had found my quarry. Tracing the hull on my left, I trudged forward in search of access to the wreck. My progress was interrupted when something else came into view on my right: this too was huge and metal and monolithic. Another wreck? What are the odds? But as I stepped closer to the cyclopian object I saw that it could not have been man-made.

Angular, colossal, unnatural: the leviathan object embedded in the silt and shale was cocked to one side at an 80-degree angle. Its surface was sheer, a perfect corner dividing one side from the other, but each face was pock-marked; holes burrowed into the burnished metal in hives as far as I could see. No deepsea algae dared attend the object: its surface was completely clean. By the light of my suit alone I could not tell how far it extended in any direction, but the USS Cetus had sunk directly adjacent to it.

The lover‚Äôs lull tore my attention away from the colossal thing. The object of my desire was still in the ship, this new discovery would have to wait. Walking forward, a gash in the hull of the Cetus limped into view through the silty gloom. The horizontal rip in the vessel was bent inward at the edges; vertical ribs of reinforcing metal that had once held the hull rigid protruded from the lips like hooked teeth as I set foot inside the mouth of the great dead thing.

Every inch of the ship was waterlogged, but even in its sunken state, something in the back of my mind expected to meet others roaming the halls. That same something told me that behind the closed doors I passed by, the proud crew was still occupied with their duties about the stalwart vessel. I moved as quietly and quickly as I could to avoid disturbing them; here I was, a stowaway. Hallway stretched into hallway until the lull led me to the ship‚Äôs secure holding facility.

The vault was impressive; riveted metal bars reinforced the steel panels which surrounded the circular vault door, adorned with an equally impressive vault wheel. I patted the tools on my belt as I approached: pressure-proofed powerdrill, waterproofed data key, various accouterments to get into places designed to keep you out, all useless now because the vault door hung open. Fingers of yellow light slipped weakly under the rim of the vault door: the pressure of the sea had cracked the safe for me. I pushed the door open further and the light intensified, but only slightly. I noted that the mechanized hydraulics which once locked the door into place had been shorn clean. My humble divesuit had yet to buckle under the pressure of the sea, had this mighty mechanism suffered such a catastrophic failure under these same conditions? I pushed the door further and it complied with little resistance. The room grew brighter still as its sole occupant came into view: a gold sphere the size of a cantaloupe suspended in a glass canister that terminated into a carrying handle on either side.

The light flickered tiredly; it had expended so much effort to guide me down here that, I felt, it was exhausted. The texture of its surface was imperfect: its lambent skin was hammered gold, scored by fingerprint-like ripples traced by incandescent silver. Smooth symbols in an unknown script flowed like water with the pattern of the fingerprints; instructions or blessings or warnings or curses. The glass tube had survived the pressure which had rocked even the great door, though it had been cracked. I approached the asset and grasped the carrying handles. The light faded further, panting with exhaustion, but I had the striking sense in my lizard-brain that it was relieved by my touch.

And yet the force continued to pull, the same lover‚Äôs lull, back the way I had come, back out the maw of the sunken Cetus; back toward, I already knew, the pockmarked metal thing. Whatever and whoever it might be, the lover‚Äôs lull was not seated inside the precious thing that I now held in both hands. Shivering weakly, I surrendered entirely to the lull; my limbs felt moved by an unseen current as I retraced my steps past the halls of busy drowned sailors until the inert wreck spat me out again, and I was face to face with the cockeyed object sitting in the silt.

A wound in the object: ten feet wide and thirty tall, directly across from the opening in the hull of the Cetus. How did I miss it the first time? The human vessel was forgotten, the asset in my hands faded from memory: the lover‚Äôs lull pulled me into the opening. Even though I knew my orders were to resurface with the asset intact to prepare for extraction, I disregarded those orders. This was more important.

A room stretched infinitely into darkness in every direction. The floor was made of the same pockmarked meteorite as the rest of the structure, but no walls could be seen. It was an abyss of its own in here; no bubbles in the water, no life except my own. I walked toward nothing but the lull while the asset in my hands glowed as my only sputtering light. The golden sphere fluttered in its new environment like an exhausted dog carried home from a long walk. With its own wordless voice, distinct from the lover‚Äôs lull, it whispered sweet, wordless things in my head. My mind‚Äôs eye saw visions and dreamed dreams: hurtling through a dark void, diving below deep water, impact. Death, so much death‚Äîand then life. Mammals growing up much too quickly, hominids dividing themselves from apes, dancing, dancing: dancing around fires, dancing under golden stars: love.

Then I saw the stars with my own eyes: golden stars, true gold each one, dancing in a circuit on what seemed to be a wall some hundred yards ahead of me that stretched from an unseen ceiling down to the nickel-burnished floor. The golden stars arced downward on the left side of the wall and disappeared into the floor, only to emerge on the right side in an upward swing before repeating their orbit all over again. The asset danced too in its glass shell, rolling from one side of the tube to the other, longing to join its friends in their eternal circuit. I was caught up with a feeling of sympathy for the inanimate object in my possession, and so I retrieved the crowbar from my belt with one hand and liberated the gilded sphere from its cage. Freed from its prison, the asset was pulled by some force‚Äîperhaps the lover‚Äôs lull itself‚Äîtowards the constellation.

A tear fell from my eye as it rejoined its friends; I knew, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that the other spheres were overjoyed to see their sibling returned to them safely. I felt in the deepest part of my soul that the blinking lights of the spheres closest to the returned expatriate were worried mothers and concerned sisters that cooed and doted on the prodigal son as they abandoned their ordinary course to orbit a new constellation around the lost lamb. They spoke in a language I could not hear, but I longed to listen in on the excited chatter that doubtless occupied them.

A door: black and rock and just my height, just wide enough to pass through comfortably. It sat in the center of the circuit of gold stars. My attention was drawn from the sibling spheres to whatever lay behind its threshold. It had never been the missing gold star or the rest of its constellation which had beckoned me here: the lover was on the other side of this door, and not just a lover: father, mother, brother, sister, 

Friend.

What had begun as a low-resolution lull, a thing that stimulated feelings of infatuation and desire, a feeling which had carried me down to this place, transformed now into something else, into an invitation. It felt as though I had done a kindness to my neighbor, and now they invited me in for coffee. Somebody, it seems, wanted to talk to me.

The door: something diffused into the water from its seams; not light, not dark, impossible to describe: color of water; perfect vision; thunder. It heaved rhythmically in and out; seizing, breathing, like a living thing. Rumble of stone grating stone; basalt skin tattooed with a hundred angular symbols. The glyphs resembled what I had seen on the golden asset, but instead of logograms lovingly inlaid in gold, these symbols were older, colder, hewn into black rock. They must have predated those on the asset; their shapes were more angular, better suited to a crude chisel than a metallurgist‚Äôs fine implements, remnants of a stone age long before man and ape parted ways. The resemblance of the glyphs on the door to those on the asset offered only one conclusion: the sinking of the U.S.S. Cetus had been no accident. The asset had drifted close to home, and the lover‚Äôs lull had coaxed the ship into the black depths.

I knew that just across this threshold was a whole other world, busily ordering itself as it had since before the dawn of life. No doubt a busy parliament of supercelestial intelligences, antediluvian sages, and paracosmic artists were hard at work sustaining the universe with colors I could not even imagine. I could poke my head in unnoticed, just for a moment, a solitary anthropoid lost in a cosmic orchestra. Maybe the celestial things wouldn‚Äôt even notice me, I could steal a glance, sate my desire, and be gone in a moment. Maybe I could even say a quick ‚Äúhello‚Äù to the lover, to the friend, and be on my way. I balled a fist and poised my hand to knock on the heaving door‚Äîand I hesitated.

Did I really want to see what was going on beyond this door? Was I really prepared to poke my head into infinity? Had I really come to the very doorstep of God‚Äîand been found wanting? No sound: absolute silence. The door breathed on its own: steady, steady; it had been doing so for all time. I mistook its breathing for my own.

My hand fell to my side. If I opened that door, that great and terrible door, I would never come back, not the same. I turned around, sanity intact, and trudged back toward the wound I had entered from, and the lover‚Äôs lull ceased. I turned and stole a glance at the dancing yellow stars. Somehow I knew that the asset, the golden dancer which I had returned home, was that star, that one to the left whose comrades still clung tightly to it, still busily fretting over its return and afraid to let it go again. The stars called out profuse and silent ‚Äúthank-yous,‚Äù and it broke my heart to move on. ‚ÄúNext time!‚Äù I promised them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay next time! I have some things I need to take care of.‚Äù The stars flickered, they asked me with the tearful innocence of children: ‚ÄúDo you promise?‚Äù

Leaving that place almost killed me; the ascent literally almost killed me; I moved too quickly and the depressurization was too much to bear. But the Tarshish picked me up, took me to port, and left the unopened door and its subterranean temple behind.

A week into my stay at Nineveh County Hospital, a couple of suits paid me a visit. The company wasn‚Äôt happy with losing its asset, which, I had reported, had been destroyed by the pressure. I was informed that my hospital bills would be my own responsibility and that I shouldn‚Äôt expect any more work from them. I get the feeling they expected me to be angry, disappointed, but I honestly didn‚Äôt see what the big deal was. There were bigger things in the world than money and health. Breathing in the sweet and fragrant air of a maritime hospital, I laid in that bed; I, a misbegotten child of a realm nobody else had ever seen, an augur of a God I had dared not look upon, and I was alive.

The nurse who checks on me laughed at a dumb joke I told, I think I‚Äôll buy her a drink when I‚Äôm out of here. The job boards I‚Äôve been browsing show openings for scuba diving instructors: that sounds like fun. The sun rose one morning and again the next; I saw it all again for the first time.

As for the lover‚Äôs lull, I feel it still, but it doesn‚Äôt invite me back into the ocean. It encourages me to talk to the homeless guy outside my grocery store, to volunteer at church, to pet the stray cats that beg for morsels of food. I never learned its name, never looked behind the door, but I knew it was God. I don‚Äôt know if God is the reality beyond reality or the still small voice that whispers in our fledgeling ears, not yet grown enough to listen. All I know is that God lives behind a door, far below the earth, and I do not need to knock any more.",1,1758482193.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1nn0usd,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nn0usd/fn_a_past_life/,[FN] A Past Life,"7:03AM, Stanley woke up in a sweat for the 4th time this week. ‚ÄúIt happened again,‚Äù he says to Elaine, his wife.¬†

Elaine quickly sits up in bed, half asleep. ‚ÄúWhat was it about this time?‚Äù she replies, fetching a notebook.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt fully remember, it was the same long staircase and shadowy figure.‚Äù¬†

Elaine, while writing this information down, says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm¬†telling you; you should go to dream therapy.¬†You‚Äôll¬†find out lots about yourself.‚Äù¬†

Stanley rolls his eyes. ‚ÄúNot this again, Elaine, you know I¬†don‚Äôt¬†believe in star signs and whatnot. Why would you think it would be different about my dreams having some meaning?‚Äù¬†

Elaine‚Äôs smile faded; she clicked her pen shut and set the notebook aside.¬†

Stanley doubles down. ‚ÄúWhat? You think¬†there's¬†a hidden decoded message I need to figure out? I just need to get some pills for it.‚Äù¬†

Elaine rolls over in bed and goes back to sleep while Stanley gets out of bed and gets ready for work at 8:30AM.¬†

While walking down the busy streets of Manhattan, Stanley is pondering about the recurring dreams and accidentally bumps into someone, spilling his morning coffee. ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù Stanley muttered.¬†

Stanley, finishing the walk to his office building, is convincing himself the dreams are nothing and Elaine was simply overreacting. Although, the memory of the staircase lingered at the back of his mind.¬†

Stanley clocks out at 5:00PM and stops by his local pharmacy on the way home to pick up magnesium. ‚ÄúThis will do the trick,‚Äù Stanley says while walking home to his apartment.¬†

Stanley is at his front door with bloodshot eyes and heavy eyebags, trench coat on and magnesium in hand. He takes a deep breath in and out and puts on a smile for Elaine.¬†

He unlocks the door and walks into the sitting room where Elaine would usually be watching her soap opera¬†that‚Äôs¬†on at this hour. ‚ÄúElaine, I‚Äôm home,‚Äù Stanley shouts.¬†

He walks upstairs to his bedroom and opens the door. Elaine and someone Stanley¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†recognise are in their bedroom, looking serious.¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Stanley asks.¬†

‚ÄúAn intervention.‚Äù¬†

Stanley becomes serious. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you two get on with it then, there‚Äôs a game on, so I won‚Äôt disturb.‚Äù¬†

Elaine and her friend look confused. Stanley looks at Elaine‚Äôs friend while slowly leaving the room, as if he has intruded.¬†

‚ÄúYou can get through what it is you‚Äôre going¬†throug‚Äî‚Äù Elaine‚Äôs friend begins.¬†

‚ÄúNot about her, Stanley! About you,‚Äù Elaine interrupts.¬†

Stanley fully walks into the room and shuts the door behind him, bewildered. ‚ÄúAbout me? Why would I need one?‚Äù he asks, almost offended.¬†

‚ÄúYour dreams. Something about this¬†isn‚Äôt¬†right! And Claire agrees. Lucky for you,¬†she‚Äôs¬†a specialist in dreams and can tell you what they mean.‚Äù Elaine gestures to the woman next to her.¬†

Stanley¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†know what to say, shocked at how serious his wife is taking this. He kindly ushers Claire out while Elaine is not pleased.¬†

‚ÄúWhy would you be so rude‚Äî‚Äù Elaine begins.¬†

‚ÄúI just want to go to bed, we can talk tomorrow. I got medicine for myself, so¬†it‚Äôll¬†be fine. Goodnight,‚Äù Stanley cuts her off.¬†

Elaine stays silent and rolls over in bed.¬†

6:53AM. After a night of tossing and turning, Stanley wakes up in a sweat again and grabs his notebook, trying to remember details.¬†

‚ÄúLet me guess, it happened again,‚Äù Elaine says.¬†

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Stanley lies, ashamed to admit he wants help.¬†

Elaine knows he is lying, so she goes back to sleep.¬†

Stanley writes down:¬†Was walking around and saw people laughing. One had black hair. They stopped laughing and looked dead at me. Forgot what happened next but something did, then I remember someone saying Echo and then I saw the staircase and woke up in a jolt again.¬†

Stanley is getting more anxious every night now, not knowing why this is happening. He is a man that loves solutions and answers.¬†

‚ÄúWhy am I doing this?‚Äù Stanley mutters, ashamed he‚Äôs writing this down but not asking for help.¬†

He starts his day early and writes a letter to Elaine:¬†I‚Äôm sorry. I would be willing to talk to Claire. See you later.¬†

Then he heads to work in a slightly better mood.¬†

After a long day of fidgeting at work, wondering if Elaine will accept his apology and pondering more about his dreams, he‚Äôs walking home.¬†

Stanley gets on the packed tube and freezes. He hears the same laugh from his dreams.¬†

His eyes come alive, and he starts moving his head frantically, looking at everyone¬†who‚Äôs¬†in a group. It¬†doesn‚Äôt¬†help.¬†

He rushes home and bolts in the front door to meet Elaine and Claire there.¬†

He gives Elaine a big hug and asks Claire for help, filling her in on everything. Minutes of talk turn into hours.¬†

‚ÄúOkay, you understand the plan?‚Äù Claire asks.¬†

Stanley nods.¬†

‚ÄúExplain it to me so I know you understand.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúFor the next hour before I sleep, I count my fingers five times for a reality check, so I trigger myself doing that in my dream hopefully, right?‚Äù¬†

Claire smiles and gives a thumbs up.¬†

For the next hour Stanley does that and then falls asleep.¬†

Stanley is looking at his fingers, tries counting them but it isn‚Äôt making sense.¬†

He realises he‚Äôs in a dream, in the same spot as usual.¬†

Frantically looking around for answers.¬†

Stanley hears the laugh and turns around.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be here, are you?‚Äù the black-haired person says to Stanley.¬†

‚ÄúI know this is my mind playing tricks,‚Äù Stanley replies.¬†

‚ÄúYou wanted this. You asked to forget.‚Äù¬†

Stanley is confused but not intimidated.¬†

‚ÄúOur name is Echo.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you mean our‚Äî‚Äù Stanley begins.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not meant to stay small forever. The time has come. I‚Äôll guide you back tomorrow.‚Äù¬†

7:13AM. Stanley wakes up in a sweat.¬†

‚ÄúHe talked to me this time,‚Äù Stanley says to Elaine.¬†

‚ÄúAbout what?‚Äù she replies.¬†

‚ÄúNothing really, gibberish nonsense,‚Äù Stanley insists, trying to act tough.¬†

‚ÄúOkay then, I‚Äôm going to go back to bed. See you later. I‚Äôll tell Claire,‚Äù Elaine says.¬†

At 8:04AM, Stanley is on the tube. He sees Echo.¬†

Stanley does a double take, and right when he notices Echo, Echo gets off the tube.¬†

Stanley follows.¬†

Echo is picking up pace, not trying to lose him, just walking faster.¬†

Stanley shouts at Echo in the tube station and everyone turns their head. He looks like a madman.¬†

Echo walks into a room right outside of the tube station. Stanley follows.¬†

It‚Äôs pitch black. The room morphs, the door disappears, and stars appear above him.¬†

He looks ahead and he sees the staircase, and at the top is Echo.¬†

Stanley can‚Äôt feel his feet on the floor anymore.¬†

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù Stanley shouts, shaking and confused, tearing up.¬†

‚ÄúWhy are you crying, Stanley?‚Äù Echo asks. ‚ÄúThis is what you wanted.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúPlease, let me go back to normal,‚Äù Stanley begs. ‚ÄúI want to go back to my job. Please, I want my wife and my apartment and my job. The way it‚Äôs always been.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing I can do, Stanley,‚Äù Echo replies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not real. None of this is. It‚Äôs only you. Come join me.‚Äù¬†

Echo reaches his hand out from the top of the stairs.¬†

Stanley begins the climb.¬†

Each step he takes brings tears and lost memories flashing back: constellations forming, black holes collapsing, the birth of stars.¬†

As he is about to reach the top step, he remembers the last memory‚Äîseeing a little blue dot and wanting to be small.¬†

Stanley sees himself standing at every level of the stairs at once, child, stranger, star, galaxy,¬†until they all merge into one.¬†

Stanley is now face to face with Echo, who is unrecognisable.¬†

Maybe a friend promises to help you move but suddenly remembers they have to reorganize their spice rack. Or, a boss praises your ‚Äúinnovative thinking‚Äù and then quickly files it away in the well-known, yet somehow acceptable, recycling bin of polite corporate indifference.

Even politicians, whose entire job descriptions (one would think) seem to rest on these three steps, tend to stumble somewhere between the ‚Äúmean it‚Äù and the ‚Äúdo it.‚Äù

It sounds so simple: just¬†*say what you mean*. This alone could solve half of the world‚Äôs troubles.

1nn0j8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1nn0j8c/why_the_best_toaster_from_bella_might_transform/,Why the Best Toaster from BELLA Might Transform Your Mornings,"Squeezing this Bella 35165-063A toaster onto my kitchen counter was easier than I imagined. With its slender 3.58-inch profile, it just slid into place without demanding much space‚Äîexactly what you want when your countertop is already hosting a coffee maker and cutting board. The clean, Blossom pink hue added a pop of charm without being loud, blending effortlessly with the rest of my kitchen decor. Not only is it compact and cute, but it‚Äôs surprisingly robust for its size. A good toaster is an unsung hero; this one had me singing its praises.

**Design That Fits Into Any Space**

The slim design deserves applause. I live in an apartment, and counter space is at a premium. This toaster‚Äôs ability to function efficiently while taking up such minimal space was a major win. Its 10-inch long slot is a unique feature, letting me toast oversized bagels, artisan breads, and even those thick Texas toasts without requiring a knife to trim them down. Such small conveniences ended up making my breakfast routine a lot easier. 

[Check BELLA 35165-063A price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0czpf85jy/)

**User-Friendly Features That Make Life Easier**

What stuck out for me was how easy it was to use. With six adjustable shade settings, this appliance let me fine-tune my toast to that perfect golden balance I‚Äôve been chasing for years. Coupled with reheat and defrost modes, it was as if this thing anticipated every toasting need I didn‚Äôt even realize I had. Forget to eat your toast immediately? No worries; a quick reheat and it‚Äôs crunchy again. The high-lift lever was another thoughtful inclusion. Since burning my fingers on English muffins gets old fast, it felt like someone designed this feature for me personally. 

**Strengths**

- Sleek, slim design takes up minimal counter space
- Long slot accommodates larger bread varieties like bagels and baguettes  
- Six shade settings for personalized toasting  
- High-lift lever provides easy access to smaller items like muffins  
- Reheat, defrost, and auto-shutoff features for added convenience  

**Time to Toast?**

This might be my first toaster that actively helped me keep my kitchen cleaner. That removable crumb tray actually works‚ÄîI‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say it made regular clean-ups almost enjoyable. No one likes crumbs littering their workspace, and this toaster‚Äôs design ensures debris stays contained. Oh, and the cord wrap feature was a godsend. No matter how chaotic my kitchen became, the cord always found its tidy little home.

**Areas of Concern**

- Lighter plastic parts in its design may feel less premium  
- Larger loaves sometimes don‚Äôt align perfectly, leading to uneven toasting  
- Toast adjustments weren‚Äôt always as precise as the knob promised  

**Performance That Reflects The Wattage**

For an appliance powered by 900 watts, it didn‚Äôt disappoint in consistency. Whether I toasted thin slices of rye or hearty bagels straight from the freezer, the results felt reliable. That said, it‚Äôs not the fastest toaster you‚Äôll encounter. Patience is rewarded with high-quality output, but let‚Äôs just say those in a manic morning rush might find themselves tapping their foot.

**Competing Products**

Compared to other toasters like the Breville Die-Cast or Cuisinart CPT-2400, this one sits comfortably in the middle of the pack. While it doesn‚Äôt boast the high-end metal finish of a Breville, it offers far more in terms of aesthetic appeal at a friendlier price point. I also tested a Hamilton Beach toaster with two similarly long slots, but despite its wider mouth, it lacked the precision controls of this model. Performance-wise, the Bella nailed it with consistency, while price-conscious buyers might favor its rivals for value bundles.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

In terms of bang for the buck, this product punched above its weight. It has some of the bells and whistles you‚Äôd expect only from pricier alternatives‚Äîauto shut-off, reheat options, and a sturdy removable crumb tray‚Äîwithout spiking the cost too much. If you prioritize functionality wrapped in a slim, stylish package, this toaster is easy to justify. Buyers seeking a balance of utility and charm will find it well worth their time.

2. Generic hobbies: ‚Äútraveling, food, long walks, wine‚Äù - wow, you and literally every human being alive.

4. A proud declaration that you‚Äôre a ‚Äúplant mom,‚Äù immediately followed by ‚Äúlol I kill every plant I touch.‚Äù (Congrats, you‚Äôve mastered the art of buying ferns just to commit slow botanical murder.)
5. Something about being ‚Äúfluent in sarcasm‚Äù like it‚Äôs a rare skill.
6. A claim that you‚Äôre ‚Äúso bad at texting‚Äù even though your screen time is 9 hours a day.

So let‚Äôs skip all that.

About me: I‚Äôm in London, I work in finance, and yes, I travel (though I‚Äôve never been ‚Äúdetained in Spain,‚Äù so maybe I‚Äôm missing out). I‚Äôm more into finding the best dim sum spot in Chinatown, a strong negroni, or a last minute trip abroad.

What I‚Äôm looking for: something light, casual, fun. Not a serious relationship right now. Just meeting people who don‚Äôt treat dating like an admin task, enjoying a laugh, and seeing where it goes without the pressure.

**Things I appreciate:**

* A conversation that lasts more than 4 texts.
* Someone who can enjoy both a ballet at the Royal Opera House and a late-night kebab on the way home.
* A partner who doesn‚Äôt think ‚Äútraveling‚Äù is a personality, but still has a valid passport.

1nn0a9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1nn0a9o/wednesdays_insults_towards_tyler_at_willow_hill/,Wednesday's insults towards Tyler at Willow Hill and how I interpreted it,"During the Willow Hill confrontation, Tyler says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you who is lying to themselves.‚Äù And I think he knew that he was 100% right. Based on this, every insult Wednesday made towards Tyler was actually the opposite of what she had in her mind-



*-She couldn‚Äôt resist seeing him again* (Filling up all the forms, driving like a maniac to Willow Hill showed desperation from her side)

*-She fell in love with Tyler and his darkness* (‚ÄúI guess I have a type‚Äù)

*-She did not think of him as an expendable nobody* (She kept consulting him in season 1, He gave her Gomez‚Äôs police file, she definitely found him to be useful)

*-She did not think he was feeble minded* (He successfully deceived her)

*-She did not think he was just a schoolyard bully* (She didn‚Äôt judge him and said she‚Äôd take it further)

*- She did not think he had subpar barista skills* (She kept going to Weathervane for his coffee, and she knows about his latte art attempt)

*- She did not think he had generic looks* (Now this is new, as if it‚Äôs a confession that she finds him to be good-looking)

¬†

So my point is, Wednesday mentioning all of these means she actually thought of him a lot after the events of season 1. She must have thought about all of these points and used these to attack him instead. Too bad Tyler doesn‚Äôt always get Wednesday‚Äôs tendency to outright deny her feelings because in that case Tyler is the opposite.",26,1758480880.0,weyler,5,1.0,False

My last relationship was two years ago and since then, I've been out of the dating scene due to my career and fear of another messy breakup. I don't have much social media either, and being a workaholic and natural homebody, I'm not really going to bars.

Ive come to the conclusion that I need to get myself out there and try this again. I'm really looking for real companionship and love. 

Some stuff about me: I'm 32, white, 5'8"", long dark curly hair, dark blue eyes and wear glasses. I take care of myself and have impeccable hygiene. I work out four times a week and keep myself in really good shape. Been told by many that I'm handsome. Personality wise, I'm pretty quiet and reserved, with some nerdy interests and topics I can blab about under the right circumstances.

I work in Manhattan for a well known tech company and currently live in Suffolk County. Well off financially and also financially savvy. I trade stocks often and have made a healthy nestegg for myself. I live on my own in a condo.

Hobbies wise I'm into a lot to keep busy. I'm a tech nerd and like to build computers and play PC games. I love RPGs, FPS games, some moba stuff (recently got into Deadlock) and others. I love vintage electronics, especially stereo equipment and old computers. I am also a big music fan who listens to just about everything (rap, r&b, rock, metal, classics, some jazz). I repair electronics as a hobby and enjoy restoring equipment when I can. I love to cook, making myself meal prep, and would love to cook you a delicious meal for a date night. I'm also an avid reader, I love sci-fi, some fantasy and non fiction. Currently collecting tons of books and vinyl records. Big on thrifting in general.

I'm looking for the following:

25-35, Woman, height/weight proportional (sorry, not into bigger women). Financially independent. Beautiful in your own way and confident to offset my shyness is a huge plus. Located in NYC or Long Island. Looking for someone to grow with and trying for long term. Some similar interests and hobbies would be great,  but I'm happy with chill vibes on the couch, watching a TV or movie while cuddling... Dinner and Movie Dates are lovely as well.

Send me a chat here if you're interested. Please send a picture at some point and will do the same. Happy to arrange a date or to grab coffee before taking anything further. ",1,1758480827.0,u_T000000BS,0,1.0,False
1nn08zn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nn08zn/aio_for_leaving_when_my_stepdad_was_drunk/,AIO for leaving when my stepdad was drunk?,"I (19) live with my brother (17), my mom (40s), and my stepdad (40s). My father died 3 years ago- he was an alcoholic and killed himself. I was physically abused when I was younger, and I am diagnosed with PTSD alongside various other mental illnesses.

My parents had divorced when I was 8. I used to stay strictly with my dad, until he started drinking. He would injure himself, accidentally break things, yell at my siblings, vaguely threaten himself, and pull me aside to have long pointless conversations. During these times, he would start touching my legs. It made me very uncomfortable, so I told my mom I didn‚Äôt want to live with him anymore.

She married my stepdad about a year ago. He works from home, while she goes to the office. They are both big drinkers, always having multiple types of alcohol out and usually having at least one drink a day. Recently, my stepdad has been drinking during the day. He breaks things accidentally, rambles a lot, and mansplains to the nines. My mom comments on how he‚Äôs annoying while he‚Äôs drunk, but doesn‚Äôt discourage it at all. 

The other day he had pulled me aside to ramble about his life and nearly made me late to pick up my brother from school. When I came home, he had apparently broken a glass and left huge pieces all over the ground while he slept upstairs. I had gotten irritated and told my grandparents (70s) I wanted to stay with them during the day, to which they were fine with.

Yesterday, I was at home. Usually they go out for hours at a time on the weekend, but he stayed home to watch football today. I had brought home a small container of assorted fall coffee flavors and written my name on it since I had wanted to try them all myself. We have a house rule about not bringing back things from Costco only one person would want, but this was from a different store and I would be done with it quickly. My mom had asked me about it and I offered to share.

Later in the day, he had been clearly drunk for a while and I had elected to ignore it until he decided to grill me about why I wrote my name on the box. When I told him, he reminded me of the rule and then asked why I did it again. I had told him ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs not a question then, you‚Äôre getting on to me about it,‚Äù but he insisted he was genuinely asking, so I told him again. My mom told him to leave it and go outside with her, then left to sit in the backyard.

He continued to ask me about it, then mentioned how I couldn‚Äôt have things like that to myself if I wasn‚Äôt doing the chores he asked of me and compared me to my brother (he had done the reverse the other day). It‚Äôs a fair point, but it was the first time he brought up he was upset about it. He then went upstairs and I went back to what I was doing until he came back down and asked if anything he said made him an asshole. He does this a lot, usually to make me reflect or whatnot. So I told him I didn‚Äôt mind anything he had said, but I didn‚Äôt want to be around him or talk to him while he was drunk/drinking/tipsy. He then told me ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt drink or be drunk or tipsy around you ever again if you stop being selfish‚Äù, then went outside.

I broke down crying, because I thought I was setting a reasonable boundary. ‚ÄúSelfish‚Äù is specifically a trigger word my dad had used against me in the past when I had first told him I was depressed, so it set me off. I immediately decided that I did not want to be there and packed up my things and left- not without telling my brother I was doing so. My mom yelled at me from the backyard on the way out and tried to call me several times while I was driving. During the trip, I started bawling and shaking thinking they would follow me and beat me, even if they hadn‚Äôt done so for a very long time. I went to my grandparents house and explained the situation, and they agreed to let me stay over. 

My mom hasn‚Äôt asked why I left (though I told her I was safe) and I haven‚Äôt heard from my Stepdad whatsoever, but I think packing up and leaving so abruptly might have been an over reaction. I know I was over reacting because of a PTSD response already, but I don‚Äôt know if leaving was on its own too extreme. AIO?",2,1758480799.0,AmIOverreacting,5,1.0,False
1nn08n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupportforBetrayed/comments/1nn08n4/shes_doing_it_again/,She‚Äôs doing it again.,"I (M49) moved out 7 weeks ago. WS (36F) carried on an EA with her ex. I caught them in June. They‚Äôd been sexting for weeks and she met up with him and took our son. 

Then in August I found out about the EA she began in February of this year that began turning physical in March or April. Their last ‚Äúdate‚Äù was at the start of August - basically a few days before I found out. He bailed on her because, apparently, she hadn‚Äôt been totally honest with him and I blew that for her when I called him. 

He said they hadn‚Äôt ‚Äúslept together yet.‚Äù She confirmed. But he said they‚Äôd done other things. 

Finally, I found out about two weeks ago that she‚Äôs been sexting a coworker in one-on-one chats for the LAST EIGHT YEARS on and off. 

Despite all this, since I moved out, our communication has been decent. We help each other out as necessary with our kid and I‚Äôve been slowly feeling better. My confidence has gone way up (I even asked for a got a phone number of a really beautiful woman a week ago and have a date set for Wednesday - not for a relationship, but just to shake the dust off, I guess).

In the presence of my WS, I‚Äôve been funny and smooth and confident which, I guess is working on her because we had sex last week. It was‚Ä¶ passionate and energetic and good. Not that that matters. I‚Äôm also being careful obviously because I don‚Äôt really know what she‚Äôs doing now. 

But this is what fucked me up. Last week I‚Äôm at the house playing with my kid and she tells me she ran into an old coworker from her job 13 years ago on the metro. She says they talked and she got his number. I give her a ‚Äúwtf‚Äù look and she‚Äôs like, ‚Äúwait, hang on. I never was attracted to him‚Ä¶ here‚Ä¶ look‚Ä¶‚Äù and she shows me his picture. Fine. I agree with her. Guy is average at best. So? She says she always liked him. He was nice and a good manager. And she wants to reconnect with her coworkers. He says he still knows most of them so he can set a little reunion. 

Whatever. So she goes for an overnight business thing out of town on Thursday and comes back Friday. I bring our son over that night and, because I‚Äôm curious, I ask what‚Äôs up with this guy‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúMartin.‚Äù She flips out. She‚Äôs like, ‚Äúwhy do you want to know? I told you I‚Äôm not interested in him, ok?‚Äù She eventually calms down and says they‚Äôve been texting while she was away. Now I‚Äôm curious but she doesn‚Äôt volunteer the phone. She says they‚Äôre making plans to meet for coffee somewhere. Again, ok, whatever. 

So yesterday she tells me to come by if I‚Äôm available and I go. We take our dogs for a walk with our son and his buddy. And when we get back to the house she tells me she‚Äôs not happy with her WhatsApp photo. I ask her to show me. She does. And I see messages in her feed from Martin at the top of the list. 

I ask her if I can look and she kind of shrugs. So I look. She lets me scroll up a few and then seems to want the phone back‚Ä¶ like she suddenly remembers what‚Äôs there. But I keep scrolling. 

She gets up and goes to the kitchen. She says, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you were going to look through all of it. This is weird.‚Äù

I go, ‚Äúwhy is it weird? You‚Äôre offering transparency, right? Is there something I shouldn‚Äôt see?‚Äù And she goes, ‚Äúno, I told you it‚Äôs nothing. He has a daughter and I think a partner or girlfriend, so‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre worried about this. It also doesn‚Äôt make you look good.‚Äù

I was like, ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù She goes, ‚Äúyeah, it makes you look weak. And desperate.‚Äù 

I reply, ‚ÄúI am neither of those things. I‚Äôm just curious.‚Äù

I go back to the phone and, she sent him a ton of mesas over the two days. These messages are all flirty and teasing. It‚Äôs all playful and jokey and full of fucking emojis. I‚Äôm scrolling and I see he‚Äôs invited her to his house - HIS HOUSE - to drink wine this week. He‚Äôs calling her by a nickname they used to have when they worked together which she‚Äôs surprised he remembers. Anyway - he tells her it‚Äôs some special kind of wine and you have to finish it the day you open it. She says she can‚Äôt drink a bottle alone and he says, ‚ÄúI thought we would drink it together,‚Äù and she replies, ‚ÄúOoh La La. That‚Äôs a possibility.‚Äù And he goes, ‚Äúan interesting one.‚Äù

I call her out on it. I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre split up so you can do whatever the fuck you want but don‚Äôt fucking lie and gaslight me again. You specifically said you were going for ‚Äòcoffee, in public,‚Äô and here is see you‚Äôre planning to meet at his house and drink wine. I mean‚Ä¶ what the actual fuck?‚Äù 

She flips is on me again. Says I‚Äôm overreacting. 

I grabbed my shit, kissed my son goodnight and walked out. 

It‚Äôs like this woman is an addict who needs to keep cultivating the next high. I mean‚Ä¶ it opened the wound all over again.

1nn08fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AngelInvesting/comments/1nn08fp/seeking_investor_for_brick_mortar_business_ks/,Seeking Investor for Brick & Mortar Business [KS],"TL;DR: Project Porch is a compact, pickup-first caf√©/bakery with a built-in personal gifting line (ready-to-gift treats and curated bundles), plus professional gifting as an additional revenue stream. A lightweight mobile layer triggers ‚Äústart order‚Äù shortly before arrival so items are ready when guests walk in. I‚Äôm seeking an angel partner for a single-unit launch in the Kansas City metro, targeting 2026.

What it is (high level): Small-footprint caf√©/bakery focused on speed, quality, and consistency across coffee/espresso and a tight set of baked goods and confections. Personal gifting is a core revenue line for in-store and shipped orders; professional gifting is an add-on for local organizations and events. Tech approach is a major POS and loyalty provider with a light mobile front end. A proximity signal triggers prep a few minutes before arrival to balance freshness with throughput.

Why this works: A pickup-first footprint keeps labor and build-out lean. Gifting smooths seasonality and lifts average order value. Proximity-triggered prep tightens promise times without overcrowding the bar.

Status and traction (kept high level): Operating entity is formed. Playbooks and SOPs for bar, bakery, gifting, and fulfillment are drafted. Menu architecture and training modules are outlined. Local channels are identified for early personal gifting demand with optional professional orders.

Model snapshot: Average ticket targeted around $8‚Äì$10. Day-one operations are sized for a single store with fulfillment capacity. Year-one revenue target is mid-$300Ks with a path to $1M+ by year three through gifting growth and repeat ordering. Capital uses include build-out and permits, core equipment, working capital, and the mobile layer.

What I‚Äôm looking for: An angel investor comfortable with brick-and-mortar plus a light tech layer. Check size is flexible; structure can be a convertible note or simple equity (open to a SAFE if preferred). Value-add around openings, operations, or local community partnerships is a plus.

Key risks and plan: Labor and training risks are managed with a tight menu, cross-training, and rigorous SOPs. Throughput versus freshness is addressed by tuning the proximity window and throttling during peak times. COGS swings are managed through consolidated vendors and disciplined price reviews.

Ask to the sub: If you invest in first-unit retail with a tech-enabled edge, I‚Äôd appreciate a conversation. I also welcome feedback on an appropriate single-unit raise size and whether a convertible note or equity makes the most sense at this stage. DM for a brief overview deck and a high-level P\&L; I‚Äôll keep specifics off-thread.",1,1758480766.0,AngelInvesting,0,1.0,False

August, also known as the Choten, is an antagonist in the Kaijudo: Rise of the Duel Masters series The Choten is a charismatic evil genius who seeks to exploit the creature civilizations for his own purposes.

He was one of the greatest Duel Masters ever. But now The Choten is an evil mastermind who wants to rule both worlds. He believes one day The Veil will crumble and creatures will again roam Earth, so he's working to make sure he's in control when that happens. The Choten doesn't duel in the traditional way; he mixes modern tech and alchemy to bend creatures to his will.

The Choten has many allies to help him achieve his objectives, including his prot√©g√© Alakshmi and her spooky creature Razorkinder Puppet of Miasma Pit, and his second-in-command, Seneschal, a Water creature whose attitude mirrors The Choten's and who fully believes in his master's work. Even with such powerful allies, The Choten doesn't have a problem dueling when necessary, and is perhaps one of the most dangerous opponents that Ray, Allie, and Gabe may face.

Plot
He has appeared in many episodes and tries to steal the civilizations' artifacts. He had succeeded in acquiring all of them at the end of the first season but he was defeated. He has also recently completed his evolution serum, which makes a creature stronger but steals the creature's free will.

The Choten was the Duel Master for the Water Civilization in the Temple before Master Nadia was.

He is voiced by Wil Wheaton, who also voiced Michael Morningstar in Ben 10: Alien Force, and his alternative form was voiced by the late Miguel Ferrer, who also voiced Deathstroke in Teen Titans: The Judas Contract, Shan Yu in Mulan, and Big Boss in Rio 2 and then David Kaye, who voiced Megatron in both Beast Wars and the Unicron Trilogy of Transformers, after Ferrer's death in 2017 As a child Rook helped some kids gain more speed on a roundabout by having them use the slide for more momentum. After witnessing his work help the kids, Rook wanted to use his intelligence to help people's lives. 8 years later Rook was able to win 1st in his school's science fair with his invention a coffee alarm clock, and then won the next three science fairs after. However, Rook's mother was dying from a disease, and was given the opportunity to join the Epsilon Society, the world's most prestigious science organization whom Rook has dreamt about joining his whole life with his mother encouragement. Upon arriving at the warehouse that the Epsilon Society wanted to meet him at, they reveal that they have been watching him for time, and want to offer him the chance to do the best work of his life and with the world's greatest scientific minds with all the resources he needs, on the condition that he abandons his name and family so he has no emotional distraction. After Rook tells that he can't abandon his mother while she is ill, the Epsilon Society disappears.

Rook then returns to the hospital, only to sadly that his mother has died. After Rook started his company called Rook Limited (which would later become Rook Unlimited) with his mentor Dr. Racine Cleo (Dr. C), and begin working the Dashtis to turn Charter City into a Futuristic place for people to live in. After the company succeeded at getting a city contract to create a hyper speed railway know as the Mag Lev Train, the company begin to expand and turning a from gang ridded city into a futuristic metropolis and as well as making Rook famous worldwide. At he begin working with Dr. C and the Dashtis on a compound Dr. C created known as Flexarium, that he give people could mutate people. He later visited by a member of the Epsilon Society, who offered a chance to join the group again, but he refuses.

After his head of security Malcolm Kane escorts the Epsilon Society member out of his company, Rook decides to begin the next phase of Flexaruim testing on that night, he decides to inject the hyper flexarium, despite the protests Dr. C and the Dashtis that they are not ready for human testing trials yet, and mutates himself into a monster with the powers of elasticity. He then attacks his collogues but they manage to subdue him, although he manages to scare Dr. C's eye. Then they leave him for the Pearl Islands to find a cure for the flexarium, but Rook manages to escape and attack their planes killing the Dashtis and the pilot, but unbeknownst to Rook that Dr. C had survived and team up with the Dashtis' orphaned daughter Riya. Afterwards began to work on test with hyper flexarium in secret, but he continued to fail find someone who it does not turn into a monster.

One day Rook is given a breakthrough when three teenage boys fall into one of Rook Unlimited's facilities are mutated by the flexarium. After they escape being captured by Kane, Rook comes to the facility to address, the media offer a reward, when, Dr. Don Robertson, one of his disgruntled employees, is accidentally mutated into a giant monster, called Multi-Farious, who then attacks him. After Kane and his security force try contain Multi-Farious, Rook arrives by helicopter to help, despite Kane telling to leave for his own safety. Rook tries to calm down Multi-Faroius by telling him he can find an antidote, but Multi-Farious, still blinded by his rage over being mutated, attacks helicopter, but he is saved by one of teens. After Multi-Farious escapes and the three teens allow themselves to be taken by Kane and his security force, they brought to Rook Unlimited, where welcomes them and offers to hire them to be the official superheroes of Charter City. Not knowing his true motives, they accept, on the condition that identities can remain secret, which Rook agrees to, and then Rook gives them visors that contain uniforms for the teens, now called Stretch, Wingspan, and Omni-Mass, the Flex Fighters.

In the last three episodes, he has laid out all his plans perfectly so that no matter what happens he will win in some way. He first manipulates the Flex Fighters by purposefully losing to them and then pretending to have been forced to work with Dr. C the entire time. He only did this so that he could get access to her lair and steal the Prolotite which he needed to create his army of Flexarium monsters.

He wasn't able to find it though at first but has a backup plan, managing to lure Blindstrike to his lair and drain her of the Prolotite that is in her suit. He does get his army destroyed by the Flex Fighters though, and while he views this as a setback he is not discouraged. He poisons the Flex Fighters through their snow cones as they manage to figure out he is Stretch Monster at that point and then frames them for an attack on him so they are branded as criminals.

Throughout the second season, he continues hunting down the Flex Fighters knowing that they will be his biggest threat. However, this obsession is taken advantage of somewhat by the Tech Men and he is thrown out of his building. He, however realizes this and decides to team up with the Flex Fighters to stop their common enemy.

When the Tech Men are defeated Rook reveals that he has managed to erase the confession that he was forced to record and also rigged the device that activated his shock collar instead to spray a gas that knocks out Dr. C. Rook now has his company back and has managed to get away with everything. Unaware to Rook, The Gentleman knows who he is and plans to exposed his identity.

Personality
Rook appears to be a kind, charismatic, and helpful person who wanted to make Charter City a safe place and help the citizens of the city. He is eccentric, yet somewhat egocentric, believing nothing is impossible. However, he is later truly revealed to be a cunning, manipulative liar, who is willing to do whatever it takes to get he wants. He is ruthless, sadistic, and is willing to use torture, murder, or brainwashing in order to fulfill his own ambitions.

Despite this, Rook truly loved his mother, not wanting to abandon her when she was when the Epsilon Society offered him membership on condition he abandons his name and family. He also wanted to help his employee, Don Robertson, by offering to find an antidote when he is mutated into Multi-Farious.

in season 2 he‚Äôs wearing black Shirt and pants because somewhat to be his evil look.

Trivia
As of 2025, there's still no word on a third season as Rook is still on the loose but if the show returns, The Gentleman will exposed his identity to the public and Rook would finally be defeated.",3,1758480702.0,DeathBattleMatchups,0,1.0,False

1nn05rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedByChery/comments/1nn05rp/explore_if_tide_laundry_detergent_sink_packs_are/,Explore if Tide Laundry Detergent Sink Packs Are Worth Packing,"Tide B000GCS004 has been a game-changer in my laundry routine. As someone who frequently travels for work, the compact nature of these Tide Sink Packs is a blessing. No more stuffing full-sized laundry detergent bottles into my luggage‚Äîthese perfectly measured packets make life so much easier. Each pack contains enough detergent for three loads, which is surprisingly effective for something this small. To be honest, when I first stumbled upon these, I was skeptical about whether they would clean as effectively as my regular detergent at home. But after using them, I was impressed with how efficiently they tackled tough stains and odors.  

**Ease of Use and Portability**  
The portable nature of these detergent packets cannot be overstated. Measuring just 4.09 x 2.99 x 1.54 inches and weighing only 2.4 ounces, they fit neatly into my toiletry bag or even the corner of my backpack. Trying them in a hotel sink while on a short business trip was a seamless experience. One of the things I appreciated most was how mess-free they were. The packets dissolving entirely without leaving behind residue was a huge plus for someone like me, who is always on the go. These packets are not designed for machines, though, which is worth noting, but their intended use for sink washing is incredibly convenient.

**Cleaning Performance**  
Despite the small size of the packet, the cleaning power packs a punch. I tested these on a shirt with a coffee stain that had been sitting for a couple of days. After soaking it and rubbing gently, the stain was nearly gone. For travel situations where you don‚Äôt have access to a robust machine, this is a lifesaver. Tide‚Äôs trusted formula works well in rinsing out tough odors too, leaving clothes smelling fresh and feeling clean.  

**Check [Tide B000GCS004](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b07jmgr536/) price on Amazon.**

**Upsides**  
‚Ä¢ Compact and travel-friendly design makes it easy to carry anywhere.  
‚Ä¢ Pre-measured packets ensure no overuse or mess.  
‚Ä¢ Removes tough stains effectively, delivering on Tide's reliability.  

**Negatives**  
‚Ä¢ Not suitable for machine washing may limit its usability at home.  
‚Ä¢ The price point could feel higher compared to buying bulk detergent for everyday use.  

**Comparable Options**  
When looking at alternatives, products like ""Travelon Laundry Soap Sheets"" seem like a reasonable competitor for handwashing laundry while traveling. However, they don‚Äôt offer the same cleaning effectiveness for tough stains like these Tide packets do. Liquid travel detergents in squeeze bottles are another common alternative, yet they are prone to leaking and can add unnecessary weight to your luggage. Tide packs, on the other hand, hit the sweet spot of effectiveness, portability, and convenience.

**Value Proposition**  
For something as compact as these Tide packets, the effectiveness they bring might justify their cost. While bulk detergents are certainly more affordable for regular home use, their lack of portability puts these Tide Sink Packs in a league of their own for travelers or for those needing a quick and easy laundry solution. The pre-measured aspect eliminates waste, and given the price-to-quality ratio, these packets seem well worth the investment for niche users like frequent travelers, hikers, or even busy individuals needing quick spot-cleaning solutions.

1nn020n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1nn020n/date_night_value_at_hilton_chicagooak_brook_resort/,Date night value at Hilton Chicago/Oak Brook resort,"TLDR; How I used two Hilton Aspire cards for a great date night at a Hilton Resort.  Review and cost breakdown at the end.

Not having any vacations planned for the rest of the year, I wanted to use my Hilton credits for a date night for myself and wife of 13 years.   Just an overnight to get away from the kids, dogs, and day-to-day crazy life.  We live near the Chicago area in Northwest Indiana and the only Hilton ""resort"" nearby was in Oak Brook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.  We had a fantastic short stay.  

We had booked just a standard room and arrived early to the resort about 2:00.  We were treated to an upgraded corner room on the sixth floor that looked over the resort grounds.  The room itself was clean with zero issues.  

We rested a bit and went down to the B Restaurant for a late lunch around 4:00.  Although it was near the lobby and a bit loud, we found a great table for two next to the windows that looked out onto the resort grounds.  The food was great.  Nothing fancy, but great.  My wife had chicken alfredo pasta and I had the margherita pizza from the wood burning oven.  We also had a couple of adult beverages and treated ourselves to some creme brulee for dessert.  

Before heading back up to the room, we grabbed some snacks from the front desk for later.  We spent the evening lying in bed talking, listening to music, watching a movie, and enjoying some alone time :). Instead of eating our snacks we bought, we decided to order some room service just before they shut down at 10:00.  I got the chicken quesadilla and my wife go the chicken fingers.  Again, really good food from B Restaurant.  

Woke up the next morning and went down to grab some breakfast in the Executive lounge.  Pretty standard breakfast buffet of scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, muffins, coffee, and chai latte.  The lounge was not crowded and clean.  Fairly standard, but no complaints.

Went back to the room to relax a bit more before we checked out just before noon.  A pleasant stay at Hilton.

Now for the financials.  Total cost of the stay: $422.  At check out I asked them to split the cost between my two Aspire cards.  $211 each.  So after my $400 in resort credits the cost came out to $22.  That's for the one night stay, lunch, drinks, dinner, snacks, and breakfast.  I had a promotion where I got 2x base points on the stay, along with my 100% bonus as a diamond member, and 14x on the Aspire card, I ended up with just over 18k Hilton Honors points for the stay.

Just as a side note, I'm using my Free Night Certificates for the Aspire cards next June when we'll be staying at Domes White Coast Milos in Greece.  The room rate is around $1,200 per night.  

I know there has been a lot of discussion about Hilton devaluation recently, but I think there is still value to be found.  And for us, it was a perfect date paid for by Hilton.  (I consider the AF for the cost covered by the FNC's).

1nn00vk,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1nn00vk/spirolactone_general_malaise/,Spirolactone & general malaise,"Hi everyone, 

I've come to you all for a bit of advice. I was diagnosed with PCOS a few years ago, and was given Metformin and Spirolactone in early 2025. I supplement with magnesium and am also on Slind, as endometriosis is plaguing my body. 

Metformin has been a blessing, but I'm worried about Spirolactone. I was given 75mg from the get-go and experienced general malaise, shaking, thirst, increased urination, the works - which got somewhat better after a while. But lately, I feel like it's come back with a vengence.

I feel exhausted all the time - even though I get plenty of sleep and eat well. My vision is blurry, it feels like my eyes are made out of cotton - my mouth is dry and my lips are chapped. Most days, my head randomly buzzes, and I experience vertigo, heart palpitation, and a crazy sense of impending doom. But most of all, I'm sweating and burning up **all. The. Time.** It's currently 15¬∞C (roughly 59¬∞F) and I have every window in the house open, as well as a fan blowing on me. 

I can't say for sure that all those symptoms improve if I accidentally miss a dose of Spiro, but I do have a gut feeling all of this is related. As often advised, I've attempted to up my water and electrolyte intake, as my crippling coffee addiction makes those symptoms worse. But it's getting to a point where I dread leaving my house, whether it be for work or social activities, because this feeling of malaise just won't go away. Heck, even getting groceries feels like running a marathon now.

I've made an appointment with my doctor, but my schedule doesn't allow me to see her for a while. Spiro has definitely helped so much with my acne and hirsutism - going from shaving my neck daily to the occasional plucking and waxing is a level of life-changing I cannot even begin to describe. That's why I've come to Reddit to see if any of you have ever gone through this, and if you have any tips to offer.

1nmzvpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1nmzvpe/help_with_the_living_room_layout_of_my_tokyo/,Help with the living room layout of my Tokyo apartment,"I need help with the living room layout of our small rental apartment in Tokyo. I have attached the layout of the apartment with measurements and some pictures of the apartment so you can get an idea of what we are working with. We do not plan to bring our dining room furniture nor will we be buying one there, we will just likely have barstools since we eat at our sofa 99% of the time and only plan to be there for a few years. So with no dining room, we can use the entirety of the space as more of a living space. We downsized from an L shape sofa to a 90"" sofa (Ikea Stockholm 2025 couch) and will be bringing my Kristina Dam round 24"" Coffee Table and my 8x10' cream wool citizenry rug. We also have a 63""x18"" media center. We are waiting for our furniture to arrive so the pictures below only have a couch for reference. Here are a few proposed layout options:

Option A: Put the TV/media center on the 80"" wall adjacent to the bedroom and the couch on the.opposite side against the wall. Please note, that in this scenario with the couch agains the wall, the couch wouldn't start until about 20 inches from the balcony window because of a structural column that juts out from the wall. So if the couch is against the wall it would make it so that the view to the TV is a bit staggered and not centered.

Option B: Same as above, except float the couch out about 12"" from the wall in front of the structural column, which allows you to bring it closer to the balcony window and more centered with the TV/media center. Cons for this layout is that it will make the space between the couch and the coffee table and between the coffee table and the media center very very tight. And in this scenario, it's really wasted space behind the couch (even if you put a console) in an apartment where space is already limited.

Option C: In this layout the couch would be adjacent to the bedroom wall but would be free floating about 12 inches from the wall to allow you to still get by and into the bedroom. The couch could then be either closer to the window or could even be in the center of the room and then the TV/media center could  be placed directly across from the couch or even in the center of the room. This would also allow enough space to put a Christmas tree or plant or akari floor lamp in the corner where the balcony window and the media center wall meet.  I really like the idea of this layout but again but again, it's probably going to make it very tight.

Option D: (no pictures of this proposed layout) Have the media center in the center of the wall furtherest away from the bedroom wall (the 167"" wall). Have the sofa either free floating in front of the balcony window or in front of the kitchen island (with the back facing the kitchen) and then have 2 chairs opposite the sofa and coffee table in the center. While I find this layout really annoying in terms of watching tv and having to turn your head to watch tv, it could look nice. Of note, the balconies are not actually used as balconies in Japan so it's fine if we put something in front of it. Think of it more like a giant window than a balcony.

Let me know your thoughts.

1nmzugq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberandchill/comments/1nmzugq/club_dawn_the_opposite_of_intensity/,Club Dawn: The Opposite of Intensity,"# Why I Coined Club Dawn

I coined the term Club Dawn as a response to the intensity we sometimes feel when trying to move up the IT career ladder. Club Dawn is the opposite of that intensity.

It‚Äôs a small, incremental stepstone to think about your IT career in the long term.

# The Trap of Intensity

A lot of people come into IT thinking: ‚ÄúI need to do this in 90 days.‚Äù ‚ÄúI need to make six figures in 90 days.‚Äù

Good intentions might get you started. But that‚Äôs not what it takes to stick through the process over a long enough time frame.

Let me ask you: How many courses have you started and not finished? How many IT domains seemed interesting, but then something shiny came along, and you changed your entire game plan?

Club Dawn is about small increments for the long term.

# Why Bootcamps Don‚Äôt Fix Procrastination

Even people who spend 15 or 20k thinking a bootcamp will solve their procrastination issues find out fast. Within two weeks, they realize: *I can‚Äôt even stay consistent for 14 days.*

Club Dawn focuses on small gains. Not the intense bursts where you think you‚Äôll accomplish it all right now.

That‚Äôs not to say with Club Dawn you can‚Äôt go fast. But if you‚Äôre going to go fast, you have to first go slow.

# The Club Dawn Baseline

At its base, Club Dawn is this: Wake up 30 minutes earlier than you normally do. Put in one Pomodoro as soon as you wake up. And stop there.

Just do that consistently. Then keep doing it more consistently. That‚Äôs all Club Dawn is.

Hold the baseline until it feels natural. Don‚Äôt think: *‚ÄúI‚Äôve done it for two days, now I should add three more Pomodoros.‚Äù*

Sure, you could probably do three. But the point isn‚Äôt intensity. The point is building a lifestyle that will actually let you climb the IT career ladder.

Waking up 30 minutes earlier every day is a marker. A sign to yourself: *Making six figures, going remote, or switching into IT is worth it. And I mean it.*

# Building Consistency

You might have lofty goals in IT. You might want to go fast.

So start slow. Start with three consistent days of the Club Dawn baseline. Then celebrate.

If 30 minutes earlier feels difficult, make it easier to look forward to. Maybe that‚Äôs grabbing your favorite coffee. Maybe it‚Äôs treating yourself to something small that kickstarts your day while you sit down and put in the work.

# Scaling Over Time

Once you‚Äôve done it for five days, push to 14. Just 25 minutes a day, consistent with your goals.

Don‚Äôt add an extra Pomodoro until you‚Äôve gone 30 days in a row. And even then, it‚Äôs optional.

Club Dawn is just 25 minutes per day, consistently.

# The Compounding Effect

How long does it really take to study for a certification?

You might look it up, find some videos, and think: *I could finish this in a week.*

Maybe. But you won‚Äôt finish the next one in a week. The point isn‚Äôt speed. The point is showing up every day.

After 30 days of 25 minutes a day, you‚Äôve finished one certification course. And you still have the habit to carry you into 60 days.

Could you finish a second certification course? What about 90 days?

What if, after 30 days, you turned those last 60 days into two Pomodoro sessions per day?

That could be two certifications in 90 days. Two certifications that change the entire direction of your career.

# Why Club Dawn Works

Club Dawn is simple. 25 minutes per day. Wake up earlier than you normally do. Stick with it long term.

You can go fast. You can make six figures fast in IT‚Äîif you‚Äôre willing to first go slow.",1,1758479892.0,cyberandchill,0,1.0,False

\--------------------------------

**MEAT GRINDER:**

I never liked entering cordoned-off sites.

It‚Äôs not just the old dust or the rust mixed with moisture; it‚Äôs something denser, as if the walls themselves held the memory of what happened inside. That night, on the outskirts of the city, the stench was unbearable.

The warehouse rose up like a sleeping monster, fenced in by patrol cars and yellow tape. Forensics went back and forth with their cases, and camera flashes lit up the blackened facade like lightning. Outside, despite the remoteness of the place, a crowd had already gathered. Journalists, onlookers, drones floating in swarms that buzzed over our heads until the police turned on the jammers. Even so, the videos were already online, circulating on thousands of screens. Damn apps. Today, nothing stays hidden: in the blink of an eye, the whole world knows what's happening.

I identified myself and crossed the tape. The silence inside hit me like a concrete wall. The echo of boots on the gritty floor, the flickering spotlights, and the gloom wrapping around the corroded columns. It was a damp, cold place, heavy with shadows that seemed to press in around you.

As I walked, I remembered how it had all begun.

A few years ago, a company announced the miracle: lab-grown vegan meat. At first, no one wanted to try it. Meat from a test tube? It sounded repulsive. But reality was stronger: real meat was becoming more and more expensive. Livestock was dying from the droughts, and people began to accept anything to fill their plates.

The business grew. Fast. First with the help of smiling influencers who promoted it as an eco-friendly alternative, then with celebrities who swore it tasted better than a traditional steak. And soon, the supply became limitless.

A zoo, a wildlife reserve... all it took was a tiny sample, and the labs would multiply it. Shark burger. Eagle kebabs. Even extinct species returned to the menu as if they had never disappeared: Whale meatballs, rhino tacos.

The industry knew no borders.

Someone... sooner or later, was going to take the next step.

It was an actor. An eccentric millionaire on a game show. He had the guests taste different exotic dishes until the last one: a simple hamburger, nothing special. They all rated it well, not knowing. And then came the reveal:

""What you just ate... is me.""

The man had taken a sample of his own tissue and had it cultivated in a Chinese lab of dubious provenance. The video went viral in a matter of hours.

And the inevitable happened.

A new market was born: celebrity meat.

What had started as a publicity stunt degenerated into a modern cult. Celebrity meat didn't just fill menus: it invaded every corner of popular culture. No one talked about albums or movies anymore, but about flavor. ""Have you tried that actor yet?"" It was discussed as if they were fine wines or exotic coffees.

It's hard for me to even breathe remembering it. Actors, singers, athletes, politicians: they all rushed to sign multi-million dollar contracts. Today you can walk into any chain and order your favorite star with fries and a soda. And for those looking for something different, influencer meat appeared: unknowns who achieved fame not for their face or talent, but for the taste of their own flesh.

But there's something no one tells you. Fashions change. As quickly as they come, they also go.

And that obsession is what brought me to this damned place.

The warehouse swallowed the light. Moving forward was like stepping into the throat of a dead beast. The spotlights barely revealed narrow corridors, dark stains on the floor, and a smell of rancid grease that clung to your clothes.

The technicians whispered, the flashes from the forensic cameras barely lit the walls, and I kept going deeper, with the feeling that every step took me further from the city and sank me into another world.

And in that darkness, memories mixed with the case.

When a flavor became old, it was pulled from circulation. You couldn't get it anymore. It only remained in the memory of those who had tasted it. And some, far too many, couldn't stand that loss.

The press baptized them as the faithful. Individuals incapable of tasting anything but their favorite meat. Collectors of an irreplaceable flavor. And when the companies refused to produce more, they looked for alternatives in clandestine labs and cell trafficking. The stories grew murkier and murkier.

What I saw that night was the confirmation of the worst.

In the center of the warehouse, under a lamp hanging from a frayed wire, there was a small table. On it, a plate with a half-eaten hamburger. The bun smashed, the meat still bleeding and warm. To one side, thick stains marked the floor.

The air was saturated with the smell. It wasn't just grease and meat. There was something else, a sickly-sweet stench that turned my stomach.

In the corner, the remains: pieces stacked like butcher's cuts, next to a grinder stained red. And beyond, on a stove that was still hot, two complete hamburgers, ready, waiting for someone who never got to sit down. A patrol car had passed nearby and the man had fled.

The victim had been recognized in seconds. One of those new, fleeting celebrities, whose meat had been in every combo a couple of years ago... until she was replaced by another.

The warehouse walls trembled with the murmurs of the crowd, but I could only hear the buzz of the lamp and my own breathing.

I had seen brutal crime scenes, but this one was different.

Some people... simply can't taste anything else anymore.

Why does Chelsu seem uncomfortable with the situation? What are these upcoming events that Dowa‚Äôs actions and the encounter with Chelsu were the first signs of? Why do I feel like Eunyeok didn‚Äôt experience the same story as SooAe regarding his disappearance?

Why doesn‚Äôt he apologize for leaving if he apologizes for the coffee and the day he was sick? Why do I feel like there‚Äôs a huge gap in the story that‚Äôs preventing us from understanding the situation? Why would he ghost SooAe if he seems just as in love and hurt by the situation? What are the scandals involving Dowa? Why did Dowa agree to become an idol? Why did Eunyeok keep the same phone number if he was unreachable for 10 years? Why do I feel like he thinks he told her something before leaving, but she never received it? What twisted the truth to this extent? Why does Eunyeok seem to think he still needs to keep a secret if Marang collapses? What is still ongoing that‚Äôs preventing him from talking? Are we sure he didn‚Äôt try to contact SooAe again? Is he really not connected to Marang? Why did he have a jellypop phone, anyway? What did he want to say to SooAe when he hesitated on the bench with the cat? If it‚Äôs not Marang, what is governing all of this? And most importantly, what‚Äôs the connection to SooAe‚Äôs novel? Why do I feel like he‚Äôs acting as contradictorily as SooAe did in Season 1 because of the love points? Why should he protect SooAe from Marang if she already found a solution with her novel? Why does he let people call him Director K? Why is he a music director and not a lawyer? What really happened to his ear? And what is brewing and about to explode in the next chapters?

Perfect. And of course, I will be getting you a slice of our freshly baked crumbled apple pie.



...



No, no, no, I won't have it. I changed a little bit of the recipe, and I want you to try it. And I know you'll let me know if it isn't up to par. 



...



Don't worry about that, it's on the house whether you like the pie or not. You're doing me a big favour. Now I'll be right back with your order when I'm done. Can I bring you a coffee too? 



...



Let me guess, Black with a spoonful of sugar? 



...



(Laugh) I'm just teasing you. You know that, though. I'll be back.

\[SFX: PLACING DISHES\]



Your pie and coffee. Tell me if you need anything else, but right now I have plenty of dishes to do before the afternoon rush starts up. 



...



Hmm?



...



Yeah, I can sit with you for a bit. I will go do the dishes first, though. I really don't want to be backed up because I don't have enough dishes for everybody. Is that alright with you?



...



I'll be right back. I feel like a broken record saying that, but what else is there to say? 



...



Watch out, I'll be there?... That doesn't even... (Laugh) You're a real funny one. Ain't that much left around this little town. \[WHISPER\] I'll be right back.



\[SFX: FOOTSTEPS LEAVING\]



LONG PAUSE



\[SFX: FOOTSTEPS RETURNING\]



(tired exhale) I didn't realise how many dishes I had to wash, but good news, they are all done now.



\[SFX: CHAIR PLOP\]



Now I can sit with you until a customer comes in. 



...



I'm having a wonderful start to my morning. Thank you so much for asking. And I will turn that question to you. 



...



That's good and bad. I'm sorry your job called you in early. I hope it was something important for making you get out of bed earlier than you usually do.



...



Oh? Very important. That makes me pretty curious. 



...



Anyway, how's the food? 



...



Amazing, just like always, huh? That makes me really happy. I like having my recipes fully rounded. 



...



I see you haven't taken a bite of the pie... is there something wrong with it? I can always get you another slice if you'd like.



...



I just noticed because when you eat, you normally do a little bit of everything until it's gone. Most people will eat their main course and then go for dessert or dessert first. Not you, though, you try everything and then find a pattern in which you like the food. I always thought that was a neat way of eating. 



...



I'm a cafe owner, and I have to know my customers if I want to please them. Watching people, talking, and getting to know who they are comes with the territory. You can tell a lot about a person the second they walk into a building. And then once they get to talking, they open their soul without even realising it.



...



You don't believe me?



...



Okay, let's try it with that person walking up right now. Their shoulders are straight and high. They exude tons of confidence with each careful step they're taking. One foot right in front of the other, arms swinging but not that much. They're wearing a suit, looks like a three-piece. Could be walking to the office right now... it is 9 am. Now what office? It could be anything. A lawyer, a publisher, a coder, a CEO... personality higher? 



...



(Laugh) Clothes are helpful when making guesses, but you shouldn't just use what they wear to guess. I said they read as confident, but did you notice their eyes? 



...



So you did? Great, would you mind telling what you think it meant? Give me a little piece of your thinking?



...



Exactly. They hold themselves very highly, but their eyes... darting back and forth without moving their head... It tells a lot.  



...



I like the way you think. You have experience reading people... Have you worked in a cafe before?



...



(Laugh) I thought I would ask. 



...



You've been coming here for a great while now, and I still have no idea where you work. 



...



Top secret, you say? 



...



Well, you've seen I'm pretty good at making assumptions for people... Can I guess what you do?



...



A challenge, you say‚Ä¶ well,  that just makes me want to do it even more. 



‚Ä¶



Yes! Okay okay. I will start from the beginning.



...



Precisely, (Amused laugh) the first day I saw you.



‚Ä¶



Of course, I remember that day. It was something I hadn‚Äôt seen in a while, so it amused me‚Ä¶ running in like you were being chased by something terrifying. Your clothes looked disheveled, buttons in the wrong places, hair out of place. You had sweat dripping from almost every part of you. \[WHISPER\] At least in the places I could see. 



‚Ä¶



Just to calmly walk up and ask for a black coffee. (Laugh) I made an assumption that you wouldn‚Äôt like it. No offense, but you just didn‚Äôt seem like a black coffee drinker or a coffee drinker in general. And then you tilted your head a bit and asked for a single spoonful of sugar. 



‚Ä¶



Nothing more and nothing less. While brewing you a fresh cup, I noticed you eyeing your watch and then pulling out your phone to also look at the time. You did that about ten times. I wanted to laugh so bad‚Ä¶ I even almost burned the pot of coffee while watching you. You were entertaining for sure. 



‚Ä¶



All this to say you were obviously late; anyone could‚Äôve pointed that out. But what about you starting a new job? 



‚Ä¶



No, I didn‚Äôt guess that by your clothes. It was the ID poking out of your pocket. Looked like something really serious. The question that was always bothering me‚Ä¶ were you actually late that day or just really nervous? 



‚Ä¶



Both? Hmm, that makes sense. I hope you didn‚Äôt get a huge earful from your new boss. That would suck, dealing with that on your first day of work.



‚Ä¶



After that first encounter, I didn‚Äôt see you for a while. It‚Äôs like you fell off the face of the earth. 



‚Ä¶



Usually, I would see a new customer a week after their first visit, but you were gone for probably two months. Not gone from my memory, though. 



‚Ä¶



I‚Äôve always been curious about this thing, too. What made you come back? 



‚Ä¶



(Laugh) Finally had time to try the food‚Ä¶ Well, I‚Äôm glad you gave this little cafe spot a second chance.



‚Ä¶



How‚Äôs the tea?



‚Ä¶



Fantastic. I will be honest, it‚Äôs not my favourite flavor, and I was really close to stopping selling it, but if I did that, you would probably have me arrested. (Laugh) Are you sure you don‚Äôt want to try anything else? The strawberry sunflower tea is delicious.



‚Ä¶



A little secret pleasure of mine. 



‚Ä¶



You‚Äôre right, I haven‚Äôt really made a guess yet. I don‚Äôt think I need to. I know exactly where you work and what you do.



‚Ä¶



I do. You‚Äôre clearly a manager for some uplist celebrity. Now, is it a singer or an actor? 



‚Ä¶



Really? I was sure I was right. Guess I‚Äôm not that good at it. 



‚Ä¶



Hmm?



‚Ä¶



\[CONFUSED\] What do I do? I‚Äôm sure you already know I‚Äôm the owner of this cafe. 



‚Ä¶



Well, there isn‚Äôt that much to say‚Ä¶ I wake up around 3 am, sometimes 2 am, to get here to start on prep work. As you know, everything I sell is made the day of. So I have tons of dough to make and get rising or chilling before they can be baked. Then I set up the seating areas, mop the floors, put the chairs down, and wipe the tables‚Ä¶ counters. After that, I work till 7 pm and start my closing duties. Which is the same thing, but in reverse sort of. Instead of making dough, I package any leftovers to hand them to friends and family. 



‚Ä¶



Sometimes there are tons of leftovers, so I‚Äôll call up the local fire department and see if they want them. Sometimes there is only one pastry, and I take it for myself. (Laugh) And that‚Äôs it. 



‚Ä¶



Oh, you want to know what I do outside of work. 



‚Ä¶



It‚Äôs not much. I take time for myself away from socializing and relax.



‚Ä¶



I hang out with friends when I‚Äôm not busy. They see me a few times a month. Being an owner is a good thing for that, you can choose the days you work or not. (Laugh) I‚Äôm not a total workaholic. 



‚Ä¶



I normally read in my free time, at home or in cafes that aren‚Äôt my own. Shocker, I know, but I won‚Äôt have to tell you that trying to relax in a place you run is practically impossible. 



‚Ä¶



What‚Äôs with all this interest in my personal life? Do you like me or something?



‚Ä¶



I‚Äôm just teasing you. I don‚Äôt mind sharing at all. I mean, you can‚Äôt expect to get to know someone if you aren‚Äôt willing to share yourself.



‚Ä¶





Hmm, that's something I wouldn‚Äôt-

\[SFX: BAG CRINKLE\]



There you go. Make sure to warm it up before you eat it; it‚Äôs better that way.

1nmzoiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/1nmzoiv/we_can_make_a_difference_right_now/,We can make a difference RIGHT NOW!,"It seems like Americans on both sides feel afraid, uncertain, and stagnant. Our nation is stuck in this mess and we are left hoping that someone will do something about it. WE ARE SOMEONE! There are simple actions we can take right now to create change without stepping too far out of our comfort zones. 

Here‚Äôs what you can do right now to make an impact:

* **Boycott large corporations**
* **Support local businesses**
* **Attend local events**
* **Deactivate or delete unnecessary ‚Äúmedia‚Äù services**
* **Volunteer!**
* **Donate what you can to groups actually making a difference**

¬†

**Democracy Is for the People**

Democracy should reflect the will of the people. We shouldn‚Äôt fear our government. If we are angry, afraid, or confused because of what is happening in our government, we aren‚Äôt living in a true democracy anymore. The power is in our hands, and it‚Äôs time we remind our politicians (on both sides) that America was built on the principle that¬†*everyone*¬†has a say!  


**Boycott Large Corporations**

This is key. Instead of waiting until mid-terms to submit your ballot, use your hard-earned dollars to cast your vote RIGHT NOW. If we make a big enough dent, they have to take notice. When employees at these big companies feel the heat and the extremely wealthy realize they could lose everything just like so many Americans, they‚Äôll start listening. Words mean nothing to them ‚Äì dollars mean everything.

Websites like¬†[goodsuniteus.com](http://goodsuniteus.com/)¬†can show you how corporations are involved in politics and where your money is going.

We can also put pressure on those who fund corporations that support confiscation of our constitutional rights. Check out this message from Dan Satterfield regarding the firing of Jimmy Kimmel and what we can do to ensure our 1st Amendment protections aren't taken away.¬†[https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1nkpiie/we\_got\_work\_to\_do/](https://www.reddit.com/r/50501/comments/1nkpiie/we_got_work_to_do/)

Please keep in mind that these are businesses in our community simply paying for advertising. Don‚Äôt be a dick, don‚Äôt threaten, just calmly make them aware that their advertisement money is going to unconstitutional practices, censorship, personal vendettas and government bullying.

Triangle: WNCN 17  
  
Again‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt be a dick. These local news organizations are just that, LOCAL, and are simply owned by these mega media organizations trying to sway power on a national scale. They can‚Äôt help it that their bosses are assholes. They didn't choose to be put in this position, but we need them to tell their bosses that they need to stop.  


**Support Local Businesses**

Put your money back into the community rather than the greedy hands of those who don‚Äôt need more. When you shop locally, you‚Äôre helping people who genuinely care about their neighbors - not faceless corporations. Go to a farmers market, eat seasonally, and choose local brands. Instead of Starbucks, go to your neighborhood coffee shop. Eat at small local food joints. Tell our local businesses that we care about them.

The triangle is home to a lot of independent grocery stores, restaurants, and neighborhood spots. Kings Red & White in Durham is a family owned grocery store that has been around since 1957! If you haven't had King's in-house made biscuits, go get some. They're in the center of the frozen aisle across from the locally sourced seasonal produce. Grab some NC made Bass Farm sausage while you're at it to go with those biscuits. And we have Weaver Street Market, a *customer* owned cooperative that proudly publishes actual numbers for how they‚Äôre giving back to the community. Corporate America isn‚Äôt doing us any favors because they only see dollar signs, but small businesses rely on the community and want to serve the community. They take care of us, we take care of them. One big family. There are too many great local spots to name here, but they all need our support.  


**Attend Local Events**

Go see a local band! Go to an art show, a local modern dance concert, a community theatre. Visit local museums. Tell them we support them. The triangle is full of amazing artists and creators! Skip the $200 concert tickets and check out a local band or theater performance instead. You might just realize that there are awesome people doing awesome things in your city.

**Deactivate or delete unnecessary ‚Äúmedia‚Äù services**

Deactivate a social media account, app, or TV streaming channel you use often. If you can‚Äôt tear yourself away, stay off as much as possible. The less time you spend on your devices, the less ads and clicks they get, the less money they get. Your attention is their currency, so take it back.

In July, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Deerhoof, Xiu Xiu and many others pulled their music from Spotify in protest against CEO Daniel Ek‚Äôs investments in AI autonomous weapons. It made a big statement. I personally deleted Spotify because I don‚Äôt want my dollars going toward autonomous, computer driven death machines in our world. I also realized other apps are actually MUCH better and I should have made the change a long time ago. Spotify‚Äôs stock dropped 20% in the weeks that followed and the company still hasn‚Äôt recovered. These actions matter!

Spend more time looking around and seeing what is happening in the world. Be present. Talk to people (I know, terrifying right?). You learn a lot more about what is actually important in the world by experiencing it rather than the internet telling you how horrible everything/everyone is. Live your life, don't live someone else's vision of your life.  


**Volunteer and Donate**

Get involved in your community. Volunteer for a local organization or cause that you believe in‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a food drive, park cleanup, or supporting a church group that gives back. Join a group picking up trash on the Eno, removing invasive plants in our parks, giving rides to people in the community that can't get where they need to go. If you can afford it, donate to grassroots organizations that are genuinely helping others. Do your research to make sure your contributions are helping local people, not profit. It's both sad and disgusting that charity organizations syphon good-hearted contributions for profit, but its more common than not. Make sure what you are supporting aligns with your values.

¬†

**Stay Strong and Speak Out**

Don't let fear take control. No matter which side of the political spectrum you‚Äôre on, we must keep speaking up and fighting for change. Violence only benefits the powerful, while average Americans continue to suffer. We can‚Äôt let fear of our government paralyze us into inaction. If we do nothing, the machine keeps rolling.

When Tucker Carlson and Ben Shapiro are saying that it has gone too far and might be time for civil disobedience, it‚Äôs time. The work is too much for any single person to do and it can seem overwhelming, but many hands make light work. We must take small steps every day in the right direction. Not through violence, not through hate. Continue protesting, speaking out, and encouraging others to do the same. It‚Äôs up to us to make sure America reflects the values of freedom and equality we‚Äôve always stood for.",37,1758479514.0,bullcity,18,0.8,False

1nmzm0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCRawData/comments/1nmzm0k/explore_if_the_dell_inspiron_15_laptop_lives_up/,Explore if the Dell Inspiron 15 Laptop Lives Up to Its Power,"Testing out the Dell Inspiron laptop, model Dell Inspiron, has been an interesting journey. As someone who spends a good portion of the day multitasking between work, entertainment, and a bit of gaming, I was curious to see if this machine could keep up with my demands. After days of running it through various tasks, here‚Äôs a detailed account of my experience.  

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
Unpacking this laptop was like unwrapping a sleek piece of tech art. The lightweight body‚Äîjust 3.65 pounds‚Äîmakes it incredibly portable. Its slim design, measuring less than an inch thick, slides right into my backpack without adding noticeable bulk. The black finish gives it a modern and professional vibe, perfect for office meetings or casual coffee shop sessions. The lift-hinge adds an ergonomic touch, tilting the keyboard slightly for more comfortable typing. Even after hours of use, it doesn‚Äôt feel like a chore.  

**Exceptional Display and Visuals**  
The display was one of the first features I tested, and it didn't disappoint. The 15.6-inch Full HD screen with its 1920 x 1080 resolution produces sharp and vibrant visuals. Netflix sessions have never looked better, and the anti-glare LED backlit display was a blessing when working near windows. My eyes appreciated Dell‚Äôs ComfortView technology, which reduces harmful blue light emissions. After hours of staring at spreadsheets and editing photos, I felt less eye strain compared to my previous device.  

[Check Dell Inspiron price on Amazon.](https://pasprog.com/p/b081n6ctdy/)

**Power-Packed Performance**  
Equipped with the Intel Core i7 processor boasting 10 cores and a turbo boost of up to 4.7 GHz, this machine is ridiculously fast. I threw everything at it‚Äîvideo editing, running multiple browser tabs, and even an intense gaming session involving graphics-heavy titles. The performance was smooth, and thanks to the 64GB DDR4 RAM, there was no hint of lag. Switching between applications was a breeze. Plus, the combination of a 2TB SSD and an additional 512GB docking station ensures ample storage for all my files, software, and media.  

**Advantages**  
Here are some upsides that caught my attention:  
- The battery charges up to 80% in just one hour with ExpressCharge.  
- It includes a lifetime Microsoft Office subscription‚Äîno additional purchases needed!  
- The AI-driven Windows 11 Pro operates remarkably well, optimizing workflows for increased productivity.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Still, no product is without its flaws:  
- The fan noise can get a little distracting during heavy usage.  
- No optical drive, which might be inconvenient for those relying on physical media.  
- The keyboard, although functional, lacks backlighting. For people who work in dim environments, this could be a minor annoyance.  

**Loaded with Connectivity Options**  
I‚Äôm super impressed with the array of ports. It has everything, including Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0, three USB ports (1x USB-A 3.2, 1x USB-A 2.0), an HDMI port, and an SD card reader. For someone like me, who transfers files or connects external screens frequently, this is a godsend. Additionally, the 8-in-1 docking station was a pleasant surprise. I hooked up extra monitors, Ethernet cables, and a couple of other peripherals with room to spare.  

**Audio and Webcam**  
Dell hasn‚Äôt skimped on the audio either. The MaxxAudio Pro stereo speakers deliver crisp sound that works well whether I‚Äôm during a video call or streaming music. The HD 720p webcam, paired with the dual digital microphone array, is good enough for virtual meetings. My coworkers mentioned my voice sounded clearer on calls compared to my older device.  

**Product Competitors**  
The Dell Inspiron laptop faces stiff competition from models like the HP Envy x360 and Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon. Compared to the HP Envy, this product edges ahead in terms of RAM (64GB vs. 16GB) and storage capacity. On the other hand, the Lenovo ThinkPad‚Äôs keyboard is more robust, which might appeal to heavy typists. However, neither rival offers a lifetime Microsoft Office subscription bundled with the device, which is a significant plus.  

**Smart Spending**  
I‚Äôd say this laptop holds up well in the price-to-quality ratio. Paying for features like a speedy processor, solid-state storage, and a lifetime Office license feels like a smart investment. Although it‚Äôs a bit on the high side, considering its bulk storage, sleek design, and performance capabilities, you‚Äôre certainly getting value for your money.

1nmzgd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineMarketingFansOf/comments/1nmzgd7/the_reality_of_recognized_content_creation/,The Reality of Recognized Content Creation,"Creating content online has its ups and downs, especially when it leads to a level of recognition. Reflecting on my 10+ years in the field, I‚Äôve seen how some content creators become local celebrities, gaining fans who seek them out in real life. This raises a lot of interesting points about the consequences of becoming ‚Äòfamous‚Äô through your work.

There‚Äôs definitely a thrill that comes with it; seeing your subscriber count grow and then experiencing people recognizing you in the grocery store or coffee shop can feel surreal. But it also brings its own set of challenges and pressures. There‚Äôs a fine line between enjoying that recognition and feeling overwhelmed by it.

It‚Äôs a double-edged sword that can lead to exciting opportunities but also anxiety. In my experience, managing that visibility is crucial. It often comes down to how you define success and what you‚Äôre really after in your content creation journey.

So, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, especially if you‚Äôve reached a level of recognition in your own work. How do you balance the excitement of new fans with the realities of visibility?",1,1758478994.0,OnlineMarketingFansOf,0,1.0,False
1nmzfm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1nmzfm2/the_man/,The Man,"I was inspired to write a suspenseful short horror story 4 days ago while at home in the rain. I only used chat gpt for a punctuation check but that was it. All the words are my own which isn‚Äôt anything super impressive but just wanted to mention that. Anyways, enjoy the story.

The Man

The obnoxious sound of Jack‚Äôs alarm clock jolted him awake at 8 a.m. Slow and sluggish in an attempt to roll himself out of bed, he noticed from his bedroom window that it was raining. A sense of subtle joy overtook him, for he loved the rain.

He couldn‚Äôt come to a conclusion for his liking of the stormy weather, but he felt it on days like this. Jack made his way downstairs to grab a cup of coffee and see his parents, who had left for their week‚Äôs vacation to Sicily, Italy. ‚ÄúOh, yeah,‚Äù he thought to himself, forgetting they left around 5 a.m. for their 8 a.m. flight this morning. Jack didn‚Äôt work and had no obligations in the home for the most part. He was a good and respectful kid, though he had no sort of inclination to work. Entertainment and indulging in hedonistic pleasures was almost a daily routine for him since graduating high school. The priorities he would have after leaving his parents‚Äô home‚Äîfinding his passions and the question of what career path he would venture into‚Äîwas too daunting to answer. He was all too comfortable.

Jack was in the kitchen grabbing the coffee his parents made earlier in the morning. He proceeded and started making toast, poured himself a heaping bowl of Apple Jacks, and made his way into his room to play some games on his Xbox. The type of games he enjoyed were first-person shooters like Call of Duty, along with a few cups of coffee just to get himself awake. Jack aspired to be a skilled gaming personality since streaming was now so prevalent. The success of many YouTube creators and gamers Jack grew up watching motivated that vision he had for himself. The rain began to pour down harder, with echoes of thunder nearby. In the midst of his gaming, Jack noticed he felt a sense of comfort. Besides the coziness he felt on days like this, the rain also gave him a sense of relief from his complacency, knowing others were inside as well due to the stormy weather. ‚ÄúMost people are probably having some sort of leisure time as well,‚Äù he thought.

As Jack continued playing his games and eating what was left of his cereal, he was interrupted by a few knocks at the front door. He ignored it at first, not wanting to answer to some salesman or neighbor so he continue with his leisurely morning in peace. He knew it was wrong but his laziness overtook him frequently. He heard more knocks again, just as the first. Out of annoyance, he removed his headset and tossed it onto his bed, got up from his chair, and made his way downstairs to answer the door. It was a FedEx driver with a package who requested a signature of approval. It was for his father, whose name was Richard Campbell. Jack made a lousy attempt at his signature on the driver‚Äôs tablet; the man thanked him, nodded, and was off.

Jack peered to the right over at his friend Stephen‚Äôs house to see if he was home, since he hadn‚Äôt texted him to play games yet. There were no cars in his driveway nor on the street in front of his home. Jack acknowledged he must be at his community college classes today. He decided not to text him until evening to join him to play Call of Duty. Outside was murky, and it was still raining considerably hard. Jack closed the door and went back inside.

After setting the box down, he saw his car keys on the counter, reminding him he should grab a snack for later, knowing he would want something while gaming with Stephen. He pondered where to go as he quickly threw on shoes and a coat, left, and walked to his old 1999 Honda Civic parked in the driveway. The rain settled a bit but was still more than a light drizzle. Jack lived in the suburbs of Huntington Beach, California, in a safe neighborhood, home to many middle-class families and a select few of the wealthy. His parents did quite well for themselves, so you could say Jack‚Äôs family lived modestly. Jack started driving to his local 7-Eleven a few minutes away, where he went roughly every other day. He knew the clerk since childhood, but the man strangely never said a word; as he recollected the thought, he smiled at the realization.

He approached the driveway entrance, and it was packed even in the rain, yet it was close to lunchtime, so he parked several spots from the store that were available. Mildly annoyed, he got out to walk inside and noticed a peculiar man‚Äînot homeless-looking, but rummaging through the trash, clearly looking for something. He was roughly six feet tall, wore a large jacket, denim pants, and a strange hat that was almost fitting for the outfit. Jack walked up and hesitated, seeing the man was partially blocking the door. He tried circumnavigating his way around him to go inside without notice. Then the man peered right, noticing Jack, and said,

‚ÄúSir, sir, have you seen a knife anywhere? You know, one that flips out and it‚Äôs about this big,‚Äù gesturing oddly with his hands.

‚ÄúNo, I haven‚Äôt. I just got here,‚Äù Jack replied, confused.

The man replied back, ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù and proceeded to look. Jack opened the door, and before closing it the man said a bit louder, ‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù He had a pocket knife in his hand, as he‚Äôd described a second ago, and said, ‚ÄúIt was in my coat pocket on my right side the whole time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI never checked it!‚Äù he yelled out, followed by some uncanny laughs, hardly breaking eye contact with Jack.

‚ÄúGlad you found it,‚Äù Jack said nervously. He closed the door quickly, considering telling the clerk to call the police. The clerk was in the corner near the back door, texting‚Äîunaware of anything that had just happened at the front with the man. Jack looked back at the man; he was walking off, so Jack decided to get his things quickly, check out, and go home. In a haste, and while taking constant glances at the front entrance and glass windows for the man, Jack grabbed a bag of BBQ Ruffles chips, a Hundred Grand chocolate bar, and an original Red Bull in the span of ten seconds. He went to pay and considered telling the clerk about the man and the interaction but didn‚Äôt, due to being in a hurry to leave. He bought his things and said, ‚ÄúHave a good one.‚Äù

The clerk didn‚Äôt say anything except for a nod of acknowledgement. Jack noticed the man was not to be seen as he walked out from the store, but as he walked a few steps he spotted him sitting in a black Jeep Cherokee a few spots from him. He walked speedily to his car to leave and suddenly the man, a few paces away, noticed him again, calling out, ‚ÄúHey, kid!‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks for the help anyway. Who knows what I would‚Äôve done tonight. I don‚Äôt have much money. I‚Äôm pretty forgetful, wouldn‚Äôt you say?‚Äù he added, now looking at Jack with that strange look as before, except this time almost grinning and not breaking eye contact again.

Jack didn‚Äôt respond; he just needed to get into the car. He didn‚Äôt know what that was and didn‚Äôt care to find out by entertaining that conversation. He started to pull out, trying his best to avoid looking at the man still parked. He left and, while driving, felt an acute sense of paranoia that the man might be following him, not knowing what to expect at this point. As he started driving, the rain began to pick up again, setting the mood for something unsettling like this‚Äîcoincidentally. He persisted, peering into his rearview window the entire way back home. Jack was having a hard time shaking the image of the man‚Äôs grin and creepy interaction they had.

What felt like an eternity, Jack was finally back to the house pulling into the driveway. Getting out of the car, he made his way to the front door, then immediately stopped and felt the need to put his car in the garage. He just didn‚Äôt want to be noticed, even though he felt his precautions of being seen were a bit dramatic. He got back in the car and pulled into the garage.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm an idiot,‚Äù he thought, going through scenarios in his head and concluding it could‚Äôve just been a strange man looking for his knife who was too talkative. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, man‚Äîthe way he looked at me was almost menacing, but regardless, that was sketchy,‚Äù he thought, almost finding room for humor in the situation. He felt relieved to be home at least and clicked the button to close the garage. Just as the garage was  beginning to close, he saw a black car drive by and made a momentary flash of eye contact with a man driving, wearing a hat, who gazed inside at him as the garage door was creeping down about a quarter of the way. The garage now made its way shut.

Jack couldn‚Äôt tell with certainty if it was the man from earlier, but seeing a black car and the man inside appearing to wear a hat made his stomach sink and his body tense up with fear. His heartbeat raced for a brief moment at the eerie thought of the man passing by. Consequently, his mind started to piece together a bunch of reasons not to be worried. Thinking the man from earlier knew where he lived became the only thing he could think about. ‚ÄúWhat if he pulled back around and he‚Äôs in front of the house looking for me?‚Äù he thought. He frantically locked the garage door and took his bag of snacks up to his room, where he sat for a while, listening to the rain and looking out his bedroom window for anybody that could be at the house. There was nobody to be seen except for a few passing cars and the empty neighborhood.

Jack didn‚Äôt want to scare his parents by telling them what happened while they were so far away in Italy, so he texted Stephen and explained the situation. Thirty minutes went by with no response. Hours went by and Jack never left his window in fear of the man coming. He decided to get back on his games without his headset in order to hear anything going on outside that would raise any alarm in him. Stephen finally texted back just as Jack hopped into his first match of a different game called Fortnite. He felt partially relieved looking at Stephen‚Äôs text saying, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs creepy, man. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs out to get you though haha. Wanna hop on some games in a while?‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be home in a couple of hours.‚Äù

Jack knew Stephen couldn‚Äôt have known the severity of the situation, having not experienced it. ‚ÄúHow could he not be creeped out and paranoid if he were in my shoes right now?‚Äù he thought. He would, Jack concluded, and the same worries came back and began to persist. A couple worried hours later he hopped on the games with Stephen around 7 p.m. Stephen had a long day of school and had gone out to dinner with some girl he recently met. As they were both playing Fortnite, Stephen asked, ‚ÄúAnything else happen since we talked?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù Jack replied. ‚ÄúI just keep thinking about it, but honestly I think I was tripping myself out thinking about it too much, if you know what I mean.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm glad you answered my call and the guy didn‚Äôt get you,‚Äù Stephen replied jokingly.

Jack laughed and said, ‚ÄúNo, for real‚Äîyou should‚Äôve seen me. I ran up to my room looking out the window for hours, thinking the dude was after me or something. Call me a lunatic or whatever, but in the moment I was ready to fight this guy if he pulled up to the house.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you wouldn‚Äôt,‚Äù Stephen said, laughing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be under your bed texting 911, let‚Äôs be real.‚Äù

‚ÄúNahhhh,‚Äù Jack said sarcastically, knowing he was probably right. They both laughed.

They continued playing for hours until Stephen had to go finish homework he was doing last second for his morning history class. They hung up the phone, and Jack was now alone but was left more at ease‚Äîeither from Stephen‚Äôs jokes and downplaying the situation, poking fun at Jack‚Äôs overreaction, or just having another person to talk to to alleviate the end of Jack‚Äôs seemingly chaotic day.

There wasn‚Äôt much else to do. He had already talked to his parents that night and caught up on how things were going. He went to bed shortly after playing a few more games. The rain was settled but kept coming about in intermittent spurts. Something woke him‚Äîhe heard a thud or a crack in the house he couldn‚Äôt make out, being mostly asleep. It wasn‚Äôt unusual for that to happen, he thought, and brushed it off. He then heard the sound of a car out front, and it was a neighbor pulling in across the street. Even after Jack‚Äôs relief, he still felt on edge and on high alert. The couple of sounds seemed to revive some anxiety that had vanished earlier. Lying in his bed, he looked out again, then one more time a few moments later out of paranoia and a last attempt of reassurance he could sleep soundly.

Another snap, the same as before, was heard in the house, only further. He nervously got up to investigate. In extreme hesitation, he poked his head looking towards the dim hallway. Jack gained some confidence and scoured the upstairs while turning the lights on. He looked out the windows of his parents‚Äô room at the backyard, then peered out over the railing down to the downstairs hallway. I guess the house is just creaking and I‚Äôm being a little girl about it? Jack thought. In frustration, he turned the lights off, shut his bedroom door, locked it, and went to bed.

The midnight rain began to pick up again and into the night. It persisted as a soothing white noise, with Jack‚Äôs window being cracked. His frustrations before bed allowed him to put his worries behind him and sleep like the man of a household does‚Äîcomfortably, but with one eye open, as they say. During Jack‚Äôs sleep, the sound of a slow-moving vehicle could be heard pulling up just across the street.

The sound of the car being put into park was enough to wake him again. Jack took a second to peer out his window, being as tired as he was and now flustered. He looked out and saw it was a black Jeep Cherokee parked on the other side of his house. His heart raced and he looked away from the window. Is it the guy? he asked himself with the utmost fear now settling in him. His hands were clammy, he went to look again, but nobody got out. The windows to the car were dark and he couldn‚Äôt make anything out from where he was. He laid back in bed, terrified of the thought of knowing the person saw him look out. If it was the man, then I assume he saw me trying to see if it was him. Knowing full well I‚Äôm terrified. What is this!? he thought to himself angrily and fearfully.

A car door then opened and shut, Jacks head lay against the wall on the foot of his. He couldn‚Äôt bear himself to look. Footsteps a moment later made their way toward the house in an offbeat rhythm and veered off to the left and stopped. Jack boldly made a peek out the window and couldn‚Äôt see anybody. What? What!? he said to himself quietly in immense confusion. Is he sneaking up on me? Jack wanted to confirm the front door was locked but couldn‚Äôt in fear of leaving his room. His mind was in right or flight. He needed to hear what was going on.

‚ÄúWhere did the man go?‚Äù Jack said quietly to himself, trembling. He could barely move a muscle, being too nervous to take a single step. He didn‚Äôt want a remnant of sound to be heard from his room. He sat there waiting and listening closely.

The faintest sound of the front door slowly swinging open could be heard from downstairs. Jack nearly fainted, his heart was beating out of his chest. He didn‚Äôt think the door was really unlocked but it had been. He stayed put in his room silently, with his whole body intensely sweating as the trepidation of the man below consumed him.

There was no sound to be heard. Jack tried sliding his window open slowly while in a shaky haze, listening attentively to the sounds below. He quietly got the window fully open, and he waited there. The silence was ominous thing‚Äîit was unbearable. The man could suddenly be heard running to and up stairs. Jack froze, unable to move and the man now tried forcing the door open but couldn‚Äôt. Jack, still on the verge of screaming and fainting, noticed the man stopped. He heard him shuffle back a few paces away from the door.

Jack, on the verge of collapse, listened, then‚ÄîSnap!

Jack let out a yell. The man‚Äôs foot blasted through the door, making a huge opening, and the man got down on a knee to reach his left arm through the hole and up to unlock the latch on the other side of the door. He fiddled with the lock and pushed  the door open. Jack instinctively drew himself to the window, climbed out to the edge, and without much hesitation leaped from the second-story window to the grass. He rolled on his shoulder hard enough to feel quite injured on getting up, but he still had the ability to run for his life.

The man‚Äôs loud footsteps could be heard running down and smacking the wooden stairs in pursuit of Jack, who made a run for it as fast as he could. He made his way sprinting down the harrowing street of his neighborhood and could see the man in the distance wildly running after him. Jack almost started crying and yelled out, ‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù loudly a couple of times as he tried keeping a steady gap between him and the man.

There wasn‚Äôt much use‚Äîthe fact was nobody was awake to be immediate help. Jack kept his pace and he began to lose the man behind him, making his way around the corner to his local park. The man relentlessly followed around the corner, but Jack was already most of the way through the park passing pine trees and the dark empty playground. He now entered the other side of the neighborhood.

Exhausted from running, Jack now made it a few blocks down and hid behind some shrubs bordering the front of a neighbor‚Äôs house without being seen. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll lay here and watch for a while‚Äù, he said, covered in sweat. His stomach and his arms now resting on the dirt, he laid there and watched from behind the shrub, hidden. Jack sat there lying for a few minutes until finally, the man‚Äîwho he could see now was the one from before: six feet tall, the same jacket and denim pants along with a strange hat, was looking around aimlessly in search for Jack, now looking frustrated. Nearing closer in Jack‚Äôs direction, he could hear the man muttering words and swearing to find him.

‚ÄúThat fucki‚Äî that fucking kid, I‚Äôll find him and kill him.‚Äù

His delirious state of mind and words just spoken startled Jack immensely. He couldn‚Äôt believe that was the same man from yesterday. He couldn‚Äôt believe he actually had vile intentions the entire time. It was all a sick trick, he thought to himself, thinking back to yesterday, trembling again. He watched as the man continued on, so Jack reached for his phone. It was at home on his bed.

‚ÄúDamnit!‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúIt makes sense‚ÄîI did leave suddenly, but not grabbing it at a time like this?‚Äù

Jack allowed for a few more minutes to pass with the idea in mind to make his way back home, hoping he could build up the courage to. A few more minutes passed‚Äîit was time. He slowly crept upward about halfway, making a few glances of confirmation and started walking toward the street. He wanted to run, but if the man was near he thought he‚Äôd run into him unexpectedly or draw attention to the sound of himself if he wasn‚Äôt walking cautiously. The streetlights gave an incandescent and eerie feel as he made his way along down the street towards the park. It had stopped raining as before but a light sprinkle could be felt as Jack proceeded for home.

He passed through the park to his side of the neighborhood. Not once had a car passed he noticed, and at an instant, a cat made its way across the street, startling Jack. He continued walking and his steps grew at a faster pace as he was approaching his house looking around both sides of the street, paranoid. He ran up, locked the front door with haste, and quickly got upstairs. He grabbed his phone from his bed and walked downstairs. He was peering out the living room windows, keeping watch for the man, as he called 911.

He saw something outside‚Äîhe couldn‚Äôt make it out, it was hard to tell in the dark of night what it was. ‚ÄúHurry and pick up please , please‚Äù he said, with extreme impatience. The operator answered. ‚ÄúHello, this is 911, what is your emergency?‚Äù

Jack gave a quick summary of what happened at 7-Eleven with the mysterious man. He quickly summarized the initial interaction, the man passing moments later in his car, seeing his house, and the later visiting him that evening and how he snuck up into the house, to his room and chased him out and down the street. The operator listened attentively taking notes and asking further questions.

‚ÄúCan you give me a description of what this man looks like?‚Äù

Jack turned away from the window, giving the reply.

The man was staring at Jack with his hallow eyes, creeping from behind the corner wall of the kitchen who‚Äôd been waiting for him to enter the house to kill him. He was smiling insanely, his body mainly exposed by the kitchen wall with his pocket knife in hand.

‚ÄúAhhhhhhh!‚Äù Jack screamed and cried, dropping his phone. He picked up a two-foot candlestick stand nearest to him at the window.

The man took a step forward, making himself fully visible, and ran at Jack with a sinister and crooked look. Jack swung as he neared, hitting his side. The man tried grabbing Jack‚Äôs shirt, but Jack barely slipped away l running toward the dining table. The man followed laughing, running around swinging his knife towards Jack, slashing his arm from across the table. Jack yelled out in pain as he got into a desperate position away toward the far side of the table. The clean slash on his arm was bleeding badly. The table gave a few feet of distant between them. The man stood there wide eyed and suddenly climbed up on top knocking everything over on the table. He stepped over toward Jack in another attempt to grab him but Jack smacked his arm away and ran toward the stairs. The man leaped off the table running quickly after him.

The man was faster and caught up to Jack grabbing him by the shirt, ready to stab him near the top of the stairs. Jack then spun around quickly, in a full 180 degrees, and swung the candle stand with all his might and struck the man badly on the side of the head. The man immediately dropped to the steps at Jacks feet, bleeding, and tumbled down to the bottom of the stairs to the living room floor. He lay there unconscious.

Jack started sobbing profusely. ‚ÄúWhat just happened?‚Äù He said as he continued sobbing in shock of everything and what he just did to the man. This went on for a moment but then couldn‚Äôt endure another second of being at the top of the stairs looking down at the man. He didn‚Äôt know for sure if he was dead or not but he appeared like it. Jack ran down the stairs, wiping his tears, and grabbed the knife off the floor that the man dropped after being hit, and called 911 again. He made the call from the sidewalk, looking into his house with the front door open.

He was traumatized and couldn‚Äôt bear being in the vicinity of the man who was likely dead. The cops were stunned by the situation. Jack‚Äôs parents and his friends later couldn‚Äôt believe what happened that night. Most of all, Jack couldn‚Äôt believe it. He was sitting there partially in delirium and a haze as the authorities made their way inside to investigate the scene. Jack stayed outside with a few cops who comforted him and asked a series of questions. He then received assistance from a peri medic to address his gash on his arm from getting cut earlier. The man was declared dead due to the mighty blow to the head with the candle stand. Jack was thinking how such a seemingly perfect day turned into a nightmare yet how lucky he was to have managed to stay alive. He thought how going to a 7 Eleven now wouldn‚Äôt be the same anymore or even just being at home alone. The prior worries Jack had of the man were now justified with the event‚Äôs that played out that evening. This moment never departed Jack‚Äôs memory, but the lasting trauma improved with time, and he went on to venture into those things we mentioned in the beginning of the story with success.

That day Jack learned a couple things: trust your instincts and never, never leave your front door unlocked.

1nmzf5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSouthAfrica/comments/1nmzf5s/is_it_just_me_or_do_groceries_feel_like_daylight/,Is it just me or do groceries feel like daylight robbery now?,"Went to Checkers/Spar/PNP for what I *thought* were a few necessities: soap, shampoo, toilet paper, milk, bread, bits for mac & cheese, yoghurt for the kids‚Ä¶ also grabbed both my kids a Steri Stumpie and a Tinkie because I‚Äôm not a monster. Boom ‚Äî **R1,000 gone**.

Today I tried again: 7kg potatoes, 4√ó bread, 4√ó milk, coffee, 18 eggs, a small peanut butter, small Bovril. **Another R600**. Like ‚Äî **how?!**

I don‚Äôt earn basic, but I‚Äôm not rolling in it either. We live on the breadline with a spreadsheet that budgets to the cent. That **R1,600** was supposed to carry us **two weeks**. Now I‚Äôm staring at the till slip like it‚Äôs a horror novel and I‚Äôm the jump-scare.

**Before anyone says ‚Äúbuy no-name / watch specials‚Äù: I already do.** I go for store brands, I chase specials, and I‚Äôve got every loyalty card under the sun. It‚Äôs still not touching sides.

I‚Äôve started a veggie garden (love it, but it takes time). Next up: chickens/ducks for eggs. I‚Äôm even eyeing a **goat** for milk and maybe selling kids (the baby goats, calm down). I‚Äôm just trying to find a way to feed my family without needing a second bond.

**SA folks ‚Äî real talk, I need practical wins:**

* Where are you getting the best prices for basics (bread, milk, eggs, potatoes) *right now*?
* Anyone running backyard **chickens/ducks**‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the honest monthly cost vs. egg yield?
* **Goat owners** in suburbia/smallholdings: realistic on feed, vet, fencing, and milk yield? Worth it or romantic nonsense?
* Any SA-specific hacks that actually move the needle (bulk groups, butcher box shares, farm stalls, WhatsApp specials groups, etc.)?

**TL;DR:** Two ‚Äúsmall‚Äù trips = **R1,600** gone. I already buy no-name, chase specials, and swipe every rewards card. Growing veggies, planning birds, maybe even a goat. How are you surviving the checkout boss fight without living on two-minute noodles?

**EDIT:** Also‚Äîyes‚Äî**even two-minute noodles are getting expensive.** So the ‚Äújust eat noodles‚Äù advice can take a hike.",72,1758478918.0,askSouthAfrica,14,0.97,False

The morning sun filtered through gauzy curtains as the girls stirred in their new home. The scent of fresh coffee‚Äîcourtesy of Maya‚Äîwafted through the halls, mingling with the sound of cardboard being torn open and the occasional thud of dropped books.

Lena sat cross-legged on the floor of her room, surrounded by half-unpacked art supplies. She stared at a blank canvas, unsure whether to paint the town or escape it.

Downstairs, Zara was already in a heated debate with Maya over the chore chart.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just assign people tasks like we‚Äôre in boot camp,‚Äù Zara snapped, arms flailing.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs called organization,‚Äù Maya replied, unfazed. ‚ÄúUnless you prefer chaos?‚Äù

‚ÄúI prefer freedom.‚Äù

Tori breezed in wearing a silk scarf and holding a potted succulent. ‚ÄúLadies, let‚Äôs channel our inner zen. This plant is named Harmony. Let‚Äôs not kill her with tension.‚Äù

Jules emerged from her room, hoodie up, earbuds in, clutching a laptop like a shield. She gave a nod to no one in particular and retreated to the corner of the living room.

The day unfolded in fragments. Lena wandered the neighborhood sketching doorways and lampposts. Tori discovered a thrift store run by a woman named Mags who wore glitter on her cheeks and spoke in rhymes. Maya joined the local library and returned with a stack of books taller than herself. Zara found a boxing gym and signed up for a trial class. Jules stayed home, coding something mysterious and refusing to explain.

That evening, they gathered in the kitchen‚Äîawkwardly, like strangers at a potluck. The spaghetti was overcooked, the garlic bread burnt, but they ate together anyway.

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre all just...figuring it out,‚Äù Lena said softly, breaking the silence.

Zara raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúFiguring out how not to strangle each other?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly,‚Äù Maya said, sipping her tea. ‚ÄúProgress.‚Äù

Tori smiled. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre like mismatched puzzle pieces. But maybe the picture‚Äôs worth it.‚Äù

Jules looked up from her screen. ‚ÄúI made a group calendar. Syncs with our phones. No more chore wars.‚Äù

Everyone blinked.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù Zara said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been listening this whole time?‚Äù

Jules shrugged. ‚ÄúI hear everything. I just don‚Äôt always respond.‚Äù

They laughed‚Äîgenuinely, for the first time.

Outside, the wind rustled the overgrown garden. Inside, something had shifted. They weren‚Äôt just unpacking boxes. They were unpacking themselves.",1,1758478888.0,AiNovelStories,0,1.0,False

All of it, chocolate included. I'd say that this knocked a massive chunk off my HA. I found this out accidentally when I had to stop drinking my beloved coffee for a stomach thing. I was surprised and happy to see that my HA (and all anxiety, actually) was much much reduced. I can think more clearly about things and actually have some perspective, instead of jumping to the worst possible conclusion about every symptom/thoughts about symptoms that I'm dealing with.

Two month ago I (F31) decided to break up with my avoidant ex (M31) (we were together for 3 years). I said I love him, but I can't be in relationship where he disrespect me, so if he want to work it out we can try to fix it. But he said ""sorry I am not capable of being in relationship, I do not want to marry, I want to live with my parents (he is 31y), because it is my safe place. At that time I had no idea he could be an avoidant. 
Things I consider as disrespect:
-i asked him what happened in the last few months, why he doesn't want spend time with me, he said ""If you were more like she (girl that I am not a huge fan of), I would spend more time with you""
- he said that he do not want to travel with me and he never did (we have been more than 10 trips and sometimes it was his idea)
-he said he would fuck his employer because she is milf. And said I do not understand jokes
-he said he doesn't love me. (After this, two weeks later he said he meant what he is not capable to love me as I expect and he loves in his way)
-etc

So after almost year of neglect I decided to leave him. I asked him if he doesnt love me or doesnt want to spend time with me why he didnt left. He said that he was comfortable and not a fan of changes. 

First week after breakup I was devastated, but still felt better than expected and had huge support of my male friends, neved been alone. But...
Me and my current ex are working together, in the same area, four meters apart, so I see him almost everyday. And during these two months we spoke like 5 times, and it was his initiative.

Convo 1:
-we talked how we both felt and how it was misscomunication. I asked if he want to be together again he said I cant decide now, but I do not close the door

Convo 2:
- we got in a fight, was heated, not as a first convo. He said he do not love me romantically. But I am special to him. He didnt change mind, he do not want a relationship. I said ""you said doors are open, so yes, I am not saying we should go back together right now, but we have to find way to communicate since we are working together""

Convo 3:
- he said our friend said to him that I am expecting to get married and have baby (it is not true). So me, my ex and our friend were driving in the same car and I asked our friend ""why you think I want baby and wedding"". And then my ex started shouting on me for making situation uncomfortable for him and our friend. 
Our friend said ""maybe we should all go to my place, have a drink and talk, because for some reason you cant be without each other and you need sort thing out""
My ex said ""i do not want to talk with her""
I said: ""i was doing great until you asked for a talk, then you said the doors are open for us"" 
He said ""yeas but I mean after 100years not now""

Convo 4:
After that convo in the car,  I came to work and kind of ignored him. He asked me to talk and asked why am I ignoring him. I said that I am psychologically and phisically tired to speak with him, with his mixed signals and etc. He asked me ""so all my friendly gestures means I want to go back together"". I said ""lets say yes""

Convo 5: 
We were in the bar with friends and one guy said ""you are beautiful"". My ex said to him ""yes I always thought the same""
Later he said: ""i want to kiss your cheeks, may I?"" I said yes, he kissed cheeks and then lips and then hugged me tightly.

Sometimes he send me tik toks, memes, likes every story. He takes care of me in work ""did you eat?"" ""Did you sleep?"" ""Can I make you coffee?""
We had convo about halloween with coworkers and I said that I probably will be poison ivy, he said ""maybe you want to be harley, so I can be joker"" i said no, he said ""ok, I suppose I will be Riddle then""

In the end I feel anger, but also deep love, because he was and still is my best friend. I still thinking about future together.

So my question is what do you think about my situation? Am I hopeless, stupid?

 Hi! I work at a community garden in Southern Louisiana and I had a big volunteer group come yesterday to take down and put up a fence. I was running around ALL day in the sun and heat. I drank 2 liters of water plus 16 ounces of electrolytes. Also drank 8 ounces of mushroom coffee in the morning. 

When I got home I immediately fell asleep for 3 hours. I woke up for a bit to make dinner then slept for 12 hours straight. When I woke up this morning everything looked a bit off. My body felt weird (general malaise), I was nauseous and my limbs felt numb. The light in my bathroom looks extremely bright to me. I looked in the mirror and my pupils were HUGE like I was tripping. My limbs felt like I was tripping on mushrooms as well. I looked in another mirror in the daylight and the didn't shrink for about an hour. 

Is this something I should go to the ER about or something that can wait for another doctor's appointment? Or just dehydration? I had a blood panel a month ago and everything was normal dispite the fact that I get fatigued easily and sleep about 12 hours a day. I frequently have numb limbs too. The dilated  pupils are new. I also have constant low-grade derealization that I assume is a side effect of the SSRI. I've had it for 5 years but it seems to be getting worse lately. ",1,1758478669.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve (36F) been dating a guy (40M) for about a year. In that short time we‚Äôve moved in together(house that I previously owned) I‚Äôve met his children (who stay with us every other week) and we‚Äôve discussed future plans. 

I noticed after a month or so of living together that he and I have extremely different ideas about home cleanliness‚Ä¶ Which can be very normal in any relationship but it‚Äôs gotten to the point that I have to remind him basic things like he needs to empty his lunchbox after work or that the coffee shouldn‚Äôt sit in the pot overnight and at this point there is an abundance of fruit flies, actual house flies, etc. in the home that I have owned for years. This issue has trickled over into time with his children, as because he has no major responsibility when it comes to cleaning, he also doesn‚Äôt expect that from his children either‚Ä¶so I‚Äôm constantly cleaning up after all of them and I feel like anytime I bring it up that ‚Äòit would be nice to have help or nice for the kids to learn some personal responsibility‚Äô I get the same response saying ‚Äúkids are messy. That‚Äôs just how it is. You say you want to have children but you can‚Äôt handle a little bit of a mess.‚Äú which has become a major point of contention. We also have different ideas about boundaries‚Ä¶my boundary is that I don‚Äôt want to be groped every time I walk by him, which I have shared with him‚Ä¶his responses are various but tend to fall into the, ‚Äúwell would you prefer I wasn‚Äôt attracted to you?‚Äù wheelhouse. 

That all has been small things continually nagging at me but more recently‚Ä¶ I had to have surgery that I didn‚Äôt inform my family about (I didn‚Äôt want to worry them) to remove precancerous cells from my cervix (yay LEEP). For this surgery I was put fully under anesthesia, so I had to have someone bring me, wait there, and take me home. He said he would be my person. The nurse explicitly told him that he needed to stay on property in case of emergency, but that he could wait in the car or wherever.‚Ä¶the surgery went fine, but then when we were on the way home he informed me that he left pretty immediately after I went back to go to the gas station down the road to buy cigarettes. I was just kind of blown away. I feel like maybe it‚Äôs a big deal that he just had one job and didn‚Äôt do it. I haven‚Äôt talked to him about it yet as I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to even start the conversation, but I feel like since the surgery he hasn‚Äôt been understanding of my need to rest (aka not help as much with his kids or yard work etc) and it‚Äôs only been 48 hours‚Ä¶and those things have been expected of me. I can kind of look past the extra help but I don‚Äôt know if I can look past him leaving me there when he was asked to stay. I feel kind of empty about it and like I cannot rely on this person.

The porta-filter retains coffee in it after dumping the puck and rinsing it, and drips all over the place when moving it. I'm about at my wits end with this machine after only a week with it. Is this normal for this machine, or did I get a bad one?

Are there better machines in this price range? Better being defined as polished fit and finish, without making a mess all over the machine and counter. I've considered the Gaggia Classic Evo, but I guess it's a completely manual machine. I'm not very competent in the morning before having a couple cups of coffee, so frothing the milk, and timing the shots manually might not be a great option for me. That said, I'm not very pleased with this Bambino Plus, and might return it and just go back to the Ninja Lux if I can't find a solution to its messiness and there aren't any other auto-frothing machines in this price range.",2,1758478433.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Cool & Kool","With the unseasonably hot weather of last week, Alamedans sought relief in a number of ways.

For me, I spent a lot of time in my HC‚Äôs (human companion) wine cellar. It's in the basement of on old Victorian with a concrete slab floor. Very ***cool***. We also took the opportunity to enjoy the ***kool*** vibe of the very dog friendly Forbidden Island outdoor dining area. We don‚Äôt get too many opportunities to wear our matching German Shepherd Hawaiian shirts, so HC made sure we got out.

Alameda has many java houses that folks can chose from to get their morning jolt, and one of the coolest and koolest has got to be Julie‚Äôs Coffee and Tea. Their garden area has lots of shade but is still nice and bright. Of course, it‚Äôs dog friendly.

Many Alamedans went over to Crab Cove and took refuge in the groves of trees and enjoyed the slight offshore breeze. This suburban wilderness was a nice change from my normal sidewalk walking routine, but it didn‚Äôt last very long.

The shoreline squirrel population was more than I could handle, and people were starting to stare. WE had to leave before someone reported me to the authorities.

Just down the street from Crab Cove is Crown Beach. Not much shade here so you need to be a sun worshiper and not be wearing a fur coat. In fact, the East Bay Regional Park District don‚Äôt even allow dogs on the beach. What‚Äôs up with that!

If you are in Harbor Bay, there is a great park right on the water with lots of shade trees making this a wonderful place to escape the heat. Shoreline Park is at the end of Aughinbaugh Way with plenty of street parking. Just watch out for the Canada Geese poop.

What was a bit unusual about this week‚Äôs heat wave was that it did not cool off in the evening making it ideal for checking out some of Alameda‚Äôs kool locations for outdoor dining. Redwood Square has Alley and Vine with tables under an arbor, and Tomatina has a great outdoor seating area that can accommodate families with strollers and canines. Their garlic knots are to die for.

If your on the west end, the Pizzeria Pappo parklet is a nice option as is the courtyard dining area of 1400. If you time your visit just right, you can enjoy the live music.

There was a lot more to cover, but I will save those items for my next report. However, I will include one sighting I made this week that was different. I found this rock near the sidewalk on Alameda Avenue. It only stayed around for two days and then disappeared. Has anyone seen this rock?

I‚Äôve started working on my costume for Halloween. Have you ?
